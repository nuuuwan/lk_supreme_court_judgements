Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. At the time of the trial, in addition to the

plaintiff, there were eight defendants. The only contesting defendant was

the 4th defendant. The others were sailing with the plaintiff. Those

defendants (except the 4th) did not raise issues, cross-examine the

plaintiffs witnesses or lead evidence. After trial, the District Judge of

Kandy entered judgment as prayed for by the plaintiff allotting undivided

shares to all the parties. Being dissatisfied with the judgment, the 4th

defendant appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kandy. At the

argument before the High Court, counsel for the plaintiff-respondent

moved that the appeal be dismissed in limine since the other defendants

had not been made parties and hence there was no properly constituted

appeal.

The High Court upheld this preliminary objection and dismissed the

appeal. This appeal by the 4th respondent is against the judgment of the

High Court.

6

In terms of section 755(1)(c) and (d), and section 758(1)(b) and (c) of the

Civil Procedure Code, the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal shall

contain inter alia the names and addresses of the parties to the action

and the names of the appellants and the respondents. The failure to name

the 1st-3rd and 5th-8th defendants as parties to the appeal violates these

sections.

In Talayaratne v. Talayaratne (1957) 61 NLR 112 the Supreme Court held

The Civil Procedure Code does not require a party appellant to name as

respondent to an appeal every party to the proceedings in the lower Court.

A party against whom no order is sought by the appellant need not be

named as a respondent.

It was held in Ibrahim v. Beebee (1916) 19 NLR 289 at 293 that for the

proper constitution of an appeal, all parties to an action who may be

prejudicially affected by the result of the appeal should be made parties.

This means, not all the parties, but all the necessary parties shall be

made parties to the appeal. Necessary parties to the appeal are the parties

who will be prejudicially or adversely affected by the result of the appeal.

The Civil Procedure Code provides for the rectification of such defects in

appropriate cases.

Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections

(other than a provision specifying the period within which any act or

thing is to be done), the Court of Appeal may, if it should be of opinion

that the respondent has not been materially prejudiced, grant relief

on such terms as it may deem just.

7

In terms of this section, any mistake, omission or defect on the part of

any appellant in complying with the provisions of chapter 58, which deals

with appeals, may be remedied if it has not caused material prejudice to

the respondent. As noted in cases such as Martin v. Suduhamy [1991] 2

Sri LR 279 and Keerthisiri v. Weerasena [1997] 1 Sri LR 70, what is

contemplated in section 759(2) is not mere prejudice but material

prejudice.

In the Supreme Court case of Nanayakkara v. Warnakulasuriya [1993] 2

Sri LR 289 at 290, Kulatunga J. stated:

The power of the Court to grant relief under section 759(2) of the

Code is wide and discretionary and is subject to such terms as the

Court may deem just. Relief may be granted even if no excuse for

non-compliance is forthcoming. However, relief cannot be granted if

the Court is of the opinion that the respondent has been materially

prejudiced in which event the appeal has to be dismissed.

Drawing the attention of the Court to section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code, learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th defendant-appellant

contends that the failure to name the 1st-3rd and 5th-8th defendants as

parties to this appeal caused no material prejudice to those defendants,

as they did not actively participate in the trial because they were sailing

with the plaintiff. I am unable to agree with this submission for the

reason that, after trial, the District Judge in his judgment allotted

undivided shares to all the defendants, and in the event the 4th

defendants appeal was allowed, those defendants would have been

materially prejudiced as the 4th defendant seeks dismissal of the

plaintiffs action. Undoubtedly, those defendants are necessary parties to

the appeal.

8

In my view, section 759(2) is inapplicable to cater to a situation such as

the present one where the issue is failure to name necessary parties as

respondents. A careful reading of section 759(2) reveals that it caters to

a situation where the Court can grant relief to an appellant despite

mistake, omission or defect if it should be of opinion that the respondent

has not been materially prejudiced. When a necessary party has not

been made a respondent, this section has no applicability.

I am aware that relief has been granted for failure to make necessary

parties as parties to the appeal under section 759(2) on the basis that no

material prejudice has been caused by such failure. This seems to me not

to be correct. The question is not whether prejudice has been caused to

the named respondents by not naming necessary parties as respondents,

which, to my mind, is meaningless. If that interpretation is given, the

appellant can name only parties who support him as respondents and

say no prejudice has been caused to them by the failure to name other

parties as respondents.

Apart from naming the correct parties as respondents, there are several

other requirements to be fulfilled for the constitution of a proper appeal.

Vide, for instance, sections 755(1)(a), (b) and (e), 756, 758(a), (d) to (f).

Section 759(2) refers to those requirements.

In a situation such as in the instant appeal, the applicable section is

section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code, which reads as follows:

If, at the hearing of the appeal, the respondent is not present and

the court is not satisfied upon the material in the record or upon other

evidence that the notice of appeal was duly served upon him or his

registered attorney as hereinbefore provided, or if it appears to the

court at such hearing that any person who was a party to the action

in the court against whose decree the appeal is made, but who has

9

not been made a party to the appeal, the court may issue the

requisite notice of appeal for service.

If at the hearing of the appeal, it is brought to the notice of Court or the

Court ex mero motu realises that a necessary party has not been named

as a respondent to the appeal or, having made a respondent, notice has

not been served on him, the Court need not dismiss the appeal in limine

on the ground that the appeal is not properly constituted. The Court has

the discretion to rectify such defects under section 770.

The invocation of section 770 is not a right of the appellant but is at the

discretion of the Court, which the Court shall exercise judicially and not

arbitrarily or capriciously.

I am conscious of the fact that it was the view of the Supreme Court

especially in the past that failure to make necessary parties respondents

to the appeal was a fatal irregularity which could not be cured by the

application of section 770 vide Seelananda Thero v. Rajapakse (1938)

39 NLR 361.

Nevertheless, the Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court in the case

of Ibrahim v. Beebee (1916) 19 NLR 289 considered the application of

section 770 somewhat favourably in instances where necessary parties

are not made parties. The Full Bench held that where an appeal has not

been properly constituted by the necessary parties being made

respondents, the appeal should be dismissed unless the defect is not one

of an obvious character which could not reasonably have been foreseen

and avoided. The discretion was considerably limited by this

qualification. In the circumstances of that case, however, the Full Bench

was inclined to act under section 770 to cure the defect where necessary

parties were not made parties to the appeal.

10

More often than not, Ibrahim v. Beebee was followed in later cases, not to

grant but to deny relief under section 770.

In Suwarishamy v. Thelenis (1952) 54 NLR 282 the 1st plaintiff

respondent took up the objection that the appeal was not properly

constituted in that the 3rd plaintiff, who is a necessary party, had not

been made a respondent. The appellant accepted that the 3rd plaintiff was

a necessary party but moved to act under section 770.

Following Ibrahim v. Beebee, the Supreme Court was not inclined to grant

relief under section 770. Gunasekara J. stated: In the present case,

which is an action for partition of land, the order that is appealed from was

made upon an intervention by the appellants, who claimed to have

succeeded to certain interests that at one time belonged to one Eliashamy.

The learned District Judge after inquiry held that Eliashamys interests

have now devolved on the 1st plaintiff and the 3rd plaintiff. In these

circumstances it is not possible to say that it was not obvious that the 3rd

plaintiff was a necessary party or that the defect was not one that could

not reasonably have been foreseen and avoided. Accordingly, the appeal

was dismissed in limine.

In cases such as Gunasekera v. Perera (1971) 74 NLR 163, Wijeratne v.

Wijeratne (1971) 74 NLR 193, H.N.G. Fernando C.J. followed Ibrahim v.

Beebee to refuse relief under section 770.

The oft-quoted judgment of the Court of Appeal in Wimalasiri v. Premasiri

[2003] 3 Sri LR 330, which held default of citing a person not living as

the respondent in the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal which

resulted from the negligence of the defendant-appellant and the registered

Attorney-at-Law would render notice and the petition of appeal void ab

initio. The defect being incurable the defendant-appellants cannot seek

relief under section 759(2) cannot be treated as good law in view of the

11

Supreme Court judgment in Nanayakkara v. Warnakulasuriya [1993] 2

Sri LR 289 at 293, where Kulatunga J. held In an application for relief

under section 759(2), the rule that the negligence of the Attorney-at-Law is

the negligence of the client does not apply as in the cases of default curable

under Sections 86(2), 87(3) and 771. Such negligence may be relevant but

it does not fetter the discretion of the Court to grant relief where it is just

and fair to do so. In any event, in Wimalasiri v. Premasiri the Court of

Appeal did not consider the applicability of section 770 at all.

In Kiri Mudiyanse v. Bandara Menika (1972) 76 NLR 371, the Supreme

Court did not find favour with the restrictive approach adopted by the

Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Ibrahim v. Beebee in interpreting

section 770. In Kiri Mudiyanse, the plaintiff-respondent relying on

Ibrahim v. Beebee raised a preliminary objection that the appeal was not

properly constituted as some of the defendants who had been granted

shares in the judgment had not been made party respondents to the

appeal and that only the plaintiff-respondent had been made a party

respondent. Pathirana J. with the agreement of Rajaratnam J. at pages

375-377 stated:

With all due respects to the decisions that have been followed

regarding the principles on which the discretion had been exercised

in respect of section 770, while admitting that there may be much to

be said for the principles enunciated in these cases, I am of opinion

that the Court cannot be fettered in exercising a discretionary power

which is given so widely by section 770 by being bound to exercise

the discretion only in conformity with the principles laid down in

those cases.

To emphasise my point that the principle laid down in Ibrahim v.

Beebee is not the sole criterion for exercising the discretion under

section 770, I would refer to the case of Dias v. Arnolis (1913) 17

12

NLR 200 which is a full bench decision. . The case of Dias v.

Arnolis had not laid down the principle which formed the decision in

Ibrahim v. Beebee, namely, that the power of dismissal should be

exercised unless the defect is not one of an obvious character which

could not have been reasonably foreseen and avoided. On the other

hand, the question whether or not the respondent ought to be added

in a particular case is a question for decision of the judge who hears

the appeal was laid down in the full bench case. Much the same

flexible language was used by Shaw J. in Ibrahim v. Beebee when

he stated as the second reason for the exercise of the discretion,

namely, unless some good cause is given for non-joinder.

With all respects to the decisions which followed Ibrahim v. Beebee

and while we are conscious of the commendation attached to it that

it had been consistently followed, I would rather on the facts and

circumstances in this case prefer to follow the principles laid down

in the full bench case of Dias v. Arnolis and also the second reason

given by Shaw J. in Ibrahim v. Beebee by stating that the exercise

of the discretion is a matter for the decision of the judge who hears

the appeal in the particular case and also that it should be exercised

when some good reason or cause is given for the non-joinder. The

discretion which is an unfettered one must, of course, be exercised

judicially and not arbitrarily and capriciously.

Rajaratnam J. added at page 378:

Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code has survived intact all the

authorities referred to above to give us still an unfettered discretion

to adjourn the hearing of the appeal to a future date and to direct

that the 1st to the 3rd and 6th to the 8th defendants be made

respondents and the requisite notices of appeal be issued to the

Fiscal for service. We have done so in the interests of a just hearing

13

of the appeal while being most respectfully mindful of the guiding

principles laid down by this Court. The plain meaning of this section,

however, shines with a clear and constant simplicity in the midst of

all the wise observations made round it during the last half of a

century.

In my view, Kiri Mudiyanse v. Bandara Menika was the watershed in the

progressive development of the law in respect of defective appeals. The

current trend of authority in the Supreme Court endorses this approach.

Accordingly, mistakes, omissions, defects or lapses such as the failure to

make necessary parties as respondents, naming deceased parties

(without substitution) in the caption, naming parties incorrectly in the

caption, failure to give notice to all named parties etc. are curable defects

under sections 759(2) and 770 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Whilst appreciating that the discretion of the Court shall not be

circumscribed by self-imposed fetters, I must add that the Court shall

not however allow defects or lapses to be cured on the application of

either section 759(2) or 770 as a matter of course or as a matter of routine

unless the appellant gives a good reason to the satisfaction of the Court

for such defect or lapse, as otherwise the express provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code under chapter 58, which lay down the procedure for the

proper constitution of an appeal, will be rendered nugatory.

In the Supreme Court case of Jayasekera v. Lakmini [2010] 1 Sri LR 41

both the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal were not in conformity

with the provisions of sections 755(1) and 758(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code. On the preliminary objection taken for non-joinder of necessary

parties, Ekanayake J. (with Asoka de Silva C.J. and Marsoof J. agreeing)

held that those lapses can be rectified in terms of section 759(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code since it has not caused material prejudice to the

other parties. Ekanayake J. further held that section 770 of the Civil

14

Procedure Code can also be made use of by the appellate Court when

granting such relief to a defaulting appellant. When it was pointed out by

counsel for the respondent that no such application invoking the

provisions of section 759 had been made for the appellate Court to grant

such relief, the Supreme Court went so far as to say at page 51 it is

undoubtedly incumbent upon the court to utilize the statutory provisions

and grant the relief embodied therein if it appears to court that it is just

and fair to do so.

In the Supreme Court case of Wilson v. Kusumawathi [2015] BLR 49

Sisira de Abrew J. with the concurrence of Marsoof J. and Sarath de

Abrew J. took the same view.

In Premaratna v. Sunil Pathirana (SC/APPEAL/49/2012, SC Minutes of

27.03.2015), when a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the

appeal was raised inter alia on the ground that a deceased party had been

named as a respondent, Wanasundara J. with Aluwihare J. and

Abeyratne J. agreeing stated:

The parties to the action in the District Court are the parties to the

action in the appellate court, in this instance the High Court of Civil

Appeals. The petition of appeal had not contained in the caption, the

names of the substituted parties. I feel that, the mere fact that only

the name of the dead person was mentioned in the caption, cannot

be held against the party seeking relief from Court. It is a lapse on

the part of the petitioners Attorney-at-Law. The litigant who has

come before Court for relief should not be deprived of his right to seek

relief due to a lapse on the part of the lawyers preparing and filing

the papers. In the case in hand, the dead person had been

substituted promptly in the District Court and named as 1A and 1B

defendants. It is only a lapse of not writing down the caption

properly. I am of the view that this is a matter which should have

15

been corrected by the High Court Judges as provided for in section

759(1) and (2). It is not an incorrigible defect, good enough for

rejecting the petition of appeal.

In a similar case where a deceased party was named as a respondent,

Dep J. (later C.J.) in Heenmenike v. Mangalika (SC/APPEAL/41/2012,

SC Minutes of 01.04.2016) held:

I hold that failure to comply with section 755(1) by not citing the 2nd

substituted plaintiff as a respondent in the notice of appeal and in

the petition of appeal is a curable defect under sections 759(2) and

section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code. I set aside the judgment in

the High Court (Civil Appeal), Kegalle in case No. 639/2009. I direct

the learned judges of the High Court (Civil Appeal) Kegalle to delete

the name of the deceased 2nd plaintiff-respondent and add the 2nd

substituted-plaintiff as the 2nd substituted-plaintiff-respondent and

proceed to hear the appeal on merits and deliver judgment according

to law.

However, it may be mentioned that if the appeal has been filed out of

time, it cannot be cured by invocation of section 759(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code because relief can be granted under that section for non-

compliance with the provisions relating to the appellate procedure other

than a provision specifying the period within which any act or thing is to

be done as stated in the section itself. The time limits within which steps

are to be taken, such as filing the notice of appeal and petition of appeal,

are mandatory and imperative.

In the Supreme Court case of Raninkumar v. Union Assurance Limited

[2003] 2 Sri LR 92 at 96, Edussuriya J. held no relief whatsoever can be

granted where there is any mistake, omission or defect in complying with

16

a provision specifying the period within which any act or thing is to be

done, even if the respondent is not materially prejudiced.

Mark Fernando J. in The Ceylon Brewery Ltd v. Jax Fernando [2001] 1

Sri LR 270 emphasised It is settled law that provisions which go to

jurisdiction must be strictly complied with.

After section 759(2) was amended by the Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act, No. 79 of 1988, the judgment of the Supreme Court in

Vithana v. Weerasinghe [1981] 1 Sri LR 52 (and the judgments that

followed it), which held that the provisions of section 759(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code are wide enough to accommodate appeals filed out of

time provided good cause is shown, cannot be regarded as binding. Let

me quote the legislative history.

Prior to the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, the

corresponding section to the present section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code was section 756(3), which read as follows:

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of this section, the

Supreme Court, if it should be of opinion that the respondent has not

been materially prejudiced, may grant relief on such terms as it may

deem just.

Section 353(2) of the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, read

as follows:

Subject to the provisions of section 330, the Supreme Court shall not

exercise the powers vested in such court by this Law to reject or

dismiss an appeal on the ground only of any error, omission or

default on the part of the appellant in complying with the provisions

17

of this Law, unless material prejudice has been caused thereby to

the respondent to such appeal.

Section 759 was amended by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Law,

No. 20 of 1977, by introducing the following as section 759(2):

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections,

the Supreme Court may, if it should be of opinion that the respondent

has not been materially prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it

may deem just.

Section 759(2) was repealed and the following section was substituted by

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 79 of 1988:

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections,

(other than a provision specifying the period within which any act or

thing is to be done) the Court of Appeal may, if it should be of opinion

that the respondent has not been materially prejudiced, grant relief

on such terms as it may deem just.

In the instant case, the 4th defendant-appellant has named only the

plaintiff as the respondent in the notice of appeal as well as in the petition

of appeal. However I find that a copy of the notice of appeal has been sent

to the registered attorney of the said defendants by registered post

although those defendants were not named as respondents in the notice

of appeal. The original registered postal article receipt has been tendered

to the District Court with the notice of appeal.

As I stated at the outset, as against the plaintiffs case, the only contesting

defendant at the trial was the 4th defendant-appellant. The other

defendants did not raise issues, cross-examine the plaintiffs witnesses,

18

or lead any evidence. The 4th defendant-appellant made the plaintiff the

only respondent in the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I take the view that the High

Court ought to have exercised its discretion in terms of section 770 in

favour of the 4th defendant-appellant and rectified the error in the interest

of justice.

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted by this

Court and the answers to them are as follows:

Q. Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law by failing

to appreciate and consider that in the circumstances aforesaid, no

material prejudice has been caused to the 1, 2(A), 3(A) and 5 to 8th

defendants by not naming them as respondents in the notice of

appeal and the petition of appeal?

A. No.

Q. Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law by failing

to appreciate and consider that in the circumstances of this case,

failure to name the defendants as respondents is a curable defect

under and in terms of Section 759(2) Civil Procedure Code and the

High Court of Civil Appeal has the power to grant such relief?

A. It is a curable defect but not under section 759(2).

Q. Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law by failing

to appreciate and consider that under and in terms of Section 770

of the Civil Procedure Code, the Court can issue the requisite notice

of appeal for service on a person who was a party to the action in

the court against whose decree the appeal is made but also who

has not been made a party to the appeal?

19

A. Yes.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court and allow the appeal but

without costs. The 4th defendant will amend the caption of the petition of

appeal and take steps to serve notice on the 1st-3rd and the 5th-8th

defendant-respondents. The High Court will hear the appeal on the

merits.
