"T
he Defendant’s central grievance over the order of the High Court of Civil Appeal"
"dated 22.07.2016 is that the order is conclusive of the merits of the Defendant’s"
"revision application and dismisses the application despite the Defendant not being"
"granted a hearing for substantive submissions on the merits of the application. The"
"Defendant contended that at the point at which the order was given, both parties"
"had only addressed a preliminary objection regarding the application. Explaining"
"his  argument,  the  Defendant  contended  that  consideration  of  the  preliminary"
"objection alone cannot be grounds for adjudication of the merits of his application,"
"and  that  a  final  order  cannot  be  given  when  the  parties  had  only  argued  on  a"
"preliminary objection."
