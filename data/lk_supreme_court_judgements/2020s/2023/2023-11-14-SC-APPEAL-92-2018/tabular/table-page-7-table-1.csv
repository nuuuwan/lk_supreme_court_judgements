"","(2A) At any time prior to the entering of judgment against a defendant for default,"
"","the court may, if the plaintiff consents, but not otherwise, set aside any order"
"","made on the basis of the default of the defendant and permit him to proceed"
"","with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to costs or"
"","otherwise as to the court shall appear fit.” [emphasis added]."
"T","he Defendant had made an application under Section 86(2) to have the ex-parte"
"","judgement vacated. The Order of the learned District Judge dated 13.01.2015 (at"
"","pg. 225 of the Original Court Record marked ‘A4’) states that an inquiry into the"
"","matter  was  conducted  and written  submissions  were  submitted  by  both  parties."
"","This  Order  too  observes  that  the  Defendant  had  been  served  summons  in  open"
"","court, that 23.04.2007 had been fixed for filing of answer and that on the said"
"","date, he had failed to file such answer. The Order also  states that the Defendant"
"","contended that the reason he could not file Answer on the said date is due sustained"
"illness,  resulting","in  his  hospitalization  from  02.04.2007  to  10.04.2007  and"
"subsequent 
time","to  recuperate 
till  02.05.2007.  Having  noted 
that  per 
the"
"","Defendant’s submissions, the he was ill from 28.03.2007, that the medical report"
"","obtained on 10.04.2007 recommends a period of rest till 24.04.2007, and that"
"consequently,","the  Appellant  would  have  been  cognizant  of 
the 
impending"
"","difficulty to appear in Court or file his Answer by 23.04.2007, the learned District"
"","Court Judge concluded that the Appellant could have made the Court aware of this"
"","difficulty  by  way  of  Counsel,  agent  or  relation.  Based  on  the  aforementioned"
"","reasoning, the learned District Court Judge concluded that the Defendant had not"
"","satisfied  Court  that  he  had  “reasonable  grounds  for  such  default”  per  Section"
"","86(2) to vacate the ex-parte judgement. The Appellant’s application under Section"
"","86(2)  was  refused  and  affirmed  the  ex-parte  judgement  dated  15.05.2007.  It"
"","would be pertinent to note that ‘Dr Doluweera’ who issued the medical certificate"
"","to the Defendant, had noted under ‘Medical Officer’s opinion’ that the Defendant"
"was ‘moderately ill’, and the Defendants’ ailment was a backpain.",""
"A","ccordingly, it is evident that although the Appellant had sought the vacation of"
"","the  ex-parte  judgement  via  the  appropriate  statutory  remedy,  he  had  not  been"
"","successful and therefore, the ex-parte judgement was affirmed at the end of the"
