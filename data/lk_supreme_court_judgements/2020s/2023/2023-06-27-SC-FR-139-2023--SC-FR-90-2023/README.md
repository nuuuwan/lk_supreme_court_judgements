Argued: 9th June, 2023

Decided: 27th June, 2023

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

I have considered the draft Order of the aforementioned applications prepared by Justice

Buwaneka Aluwihare PC and;

(i) I agree with the conclusion of the said Order with regard to the preliminary

objection raised by the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General in the above

applications,

(ii) However, I am afraid I am not in agreement with the reasoning and the conclusion

in respect of the preliminary objection raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the 14th respondent in SC/FR/90/2023 with regard to the jurisdiction of this court.

Hence, my reasoning and the decision on the said preliminary objections are stated below.

These applications were filed by the petitioners, alleging that their Fundamental Rights have been

violated by not holding the Local Authorities Elections on the 9th of March, 2023 as scheduled by

the Election Commission.

The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General who appears for the 1st, 2nd, 22nd, 23rd, 27th and

28th respondents in SC/FR/139/2023 and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 13th, 15th to 33rd, 34th and 35th respondents

in SC/FR/90/2023 raised the following preliminary objection:

the petitioners have failed to name a necessary party to the instant applications.

Particularly, though the Chairman and the members of the Election Commission

14

are named in the petitions as respondents, the petitioners have failed to name the

Election Commission as a party to the petitions. Thus, the said applications should

be dismissed in limine

He submitted that there is a clear distinction between the Election Commission and its members,

and therefore, the activities of the members of the commission cannot be considered as actions of

the said commission. Thus, the Election Commission is a necessary party to any litigation filed in

respect of matters relating to the said commission.

The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General further submitted that, though the Constitution

does not specifically state that the Election Commission has a legal personality, the Constitution

has given a legal status to the Election Commission by implication. Therefore, the Election

Commission is a necessary party to the instant application. In this regard, the learned Senior

Additional Solicitor General drew the attention of court to section 2(s) of the Interpretation

Ordinance, which states;

Person includes any body of persons corporate or unincorporate

Further, he cited The Law of Contracts by C.G. Weeramantry at page 529, where it stated;

Quasi Corporations. There are in existence many entities, which, though not

corporations or legal personae strictly so called, still enjoy many of the attributes

of corporate personality. Thus, many unincorporated associations are capable of a

continuous existence in spite of periodical changes in their composition, although

the state does not confer on them the gifts of legal personality.

In the circumstances, he submitted that the Election Commission should be considered as an

institution that has acquired legal status, and therefore, it must be named as a party to the instant

applications. Thus, the failure to name the Election Commission as a party to the instant application

is fatal, and thus, the application should be dismissed in limine.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the petitioners in SC/FR Application No. 90/2023

and the counsel appearing in SC/FR Application No. 135/2023 submitted that the independent

commissions have been created by or under the Constitution. In this regard, they drew the attention

of court to the Public Service Commission, National Police Commission, etc. and submitted that

the said commissions have no independent legal status, and therefore, the cases are filed against

the members of those commissions.

15

Furthermore, as the Election Commission does not have a legal personality, it cannot be made a

party to a case filed in court. Thus, the petitioners have made the members of the Election

Commission parties to the instant applications. Hence, they submitted that the said preliminary

objection should be overruled.

In addition to the above preliminary objection, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

14th respondent in application No. SC/FR /90/2023 raised the following preliminary objection;

The Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the said applications

In this regard, he submitted that the allegations averred in the petition are before Parliament, and

therefore, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the said application. He drew the

attention of court to paragraph 32 of the petition, the newspaper article annexed and produced as

P20(a), the press release marked and produced as P21 and the Hansard dated 23rd of February,

2023 filed by the petitioner in application No. SC/FR/90/2023. Thus, he moved for a dismissal of

the said application in limine.

Responding to the above objection, the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner in SC/FR/

90/2023 submitted that the subject matter of the petition is not before the Parliament and therefore,

the Supreme Court can proceed with the instant application. He further submitted that, in any

event, there is no legal impediment for the court to consider a matter that is pending before

Parliament and cited the instance where, while the impeachment proceeding was taking place to

impeach the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka, the Supreme Court heard the cases that

were filed challenging the said impeachment proceedings. In this regard, he cited the judgment

delivered by Justice Saleem Marsoof PC in S.C. Application No. 665/2012 (FR), S.C. Application

No. 666/2012 (FR), S.C. Application No. 667/2012 (FR)and S.C. Application No. 672/ 2012 (FR).

Is the Election Commission a necessary party to the petition

Rule 44 Supreme Court Rules inter alia states;

44. (1) Where any person applies to the Supreme Court by a petition in writing,

under and in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, for relief or redress in

respect of an infringement or an imminent infringement, or any fundamental right

or language right, by executive or administrative action, he shall

16

(a) set out in his petition a plain and concise statement of the facts and

circumstances relating to such right and the infringement or imminent

infringement thereof, including particulars of the executive or administrative

action whereby such right has been, or is about to be, infringed; where more

than one right has been, or is about to be, infringed, the facts and circumstances

relating to each such right and the infringement, or imminent infringement

thereof shall be clearly and distinctly set out. He shall, also refer to the specific

provisions or the Constitution under which any such right is claimed.

(b) name as respondents the Attorney-General and the person or persons who have

infringed, or are about to infringe, such right;

[emphasis added]

Hence, Rule 44(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules requires to name the persons who infringed or

are about to infringe the Fundamental Rights, in petitions filed under Article 126(2) of the

Constitution. Thus, it needs to be considered whether the Election Commission is a necessary party

to the above applications.

Establishment of the Election Commission

The Election Commission was established by Article 103 of the Constitution. Article 103 of the

Constitution, inter alia, states; There shall be an Election Commission (in this Chapter referred

to as the Commission) consisting of five members appointed by the President...

Further, Article 104B(1), inter alia, states that the Commission shall exercise, perform and

discharge all such powers, duties and functions conferred or imposed on or assigned to the

Commission; or to the Commissioner-General of Elections, by the Constitution, and by the law.

(a) Does the Election Commission have a legal personality

The law recognises natural persons and legal persons. A legal person is a fiction created by the

law. Further, a legal fiction that has legal status can be created only by an Act of Parliament or

under a law passed by Parliament. However, the courts have no power to create a legal personality

by reading words into a provision in the law.

17

Moreover, a legal person created by law is distinct from the natural persons who are its members.

The powers of a legal person are conferred by law at the time it is created. e.g. the power to sue

and be sued. Further, no legal proceedings can be instituted against a non-incorporated body, as

the law has not conferred power to sue or be sued by such a body. A similar view was also

expressed in Divisional Forest Officer v Sirisena [1990] 1 SLR 44 at page 49, where it was held;

The other ground on which the Appellant relied was that the Defendant to this

action was not a legal person and that the action could, therefore, not have been

maintained against the Defendant named in the plaint. As is evident from the plaint,

the Defendant has been described as the Divisional Forest Officer, Southern

Division, Galle. It is submitted that the Defendant so described is not a statutory

functionary who could be sued as a Corporation Sole. In The Land Commissioner

v. Ladamuttu Pillai it has been held by the Privy Council that Land Commissioner

is not a Corporation Sole. So also, in Singho Mahatmaya v. The Land

Commissioner the Supreme Court has held that the Land Commissioner cannot be

regarded as a Corporation Sole and, therefore, cannot be sued nominee officii.

[emphasis added]

(b) Interpretation of Article 103 of the Constitution

The constitutional provisions should always be interpreted to protect the rights enshrined in the

Constitution and not to deny them by applying a narrow interpretation. A similar view was

expressed in Ramadhari Mandal v Nilmoni Das AIR 1952 Cal 184, where it was held;

Constitutional provisions are not to be interpreted and crippled by narrow

technicalities but as embodying the working principles for practical Government.

The Constitution is not the home for legal curiosities.

[emphasis added]

Further, in Edirisuriya v Navaratnam [1985] 1 SLR 100 at page 106, the Supreme Court held;

A solemn and sacred duty has been imposed by the Constitution upon this Court,

as the highest Court of the Republic, to safeguard the fundamental rights which

have been assured by the Constitution to the citizens of the Republic as part of their

18

intangible heritage. It, therefore, behooves this Court to see that the full and free

exercise of such rights is not impeded by any flimsy and unrealistic

considerations.

In Velupillai v The Chairman, Urban District Council 39 NLR 464, Abrahams CJ held;

This is a court of Justice, it is not an Academy of Law.

Further, the aforementioned objection raised by the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General

should be considered in light of the established principles of interpretation of Constitutions whilst

giving effect to the Fundamental Rights of the people enshrined in the Constitution and the curses

curie est lex curiae.

The Constitution has established the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the

National Police Commission, the Audit Service Commission, the Finance Commission, the

Delimitation Commission, and the National Procurement Commission.

However, it is pertinent to note that the Constitution has not established the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. On the contrary, it has made provision for the

Parliament to enact legislation to establish a Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption.

Upon a careful reading of Article 103 of the Constitution, it is evident that the Election

Commission has not been created as a Corporate Sole by the legislature, nor is it stated that it may

sue or be sued in a corporate name. Furthermore, Article 103 does not seem to reveal any intention

of the legislature to incorporate the Election Commission as a legal person. When applying the

literal interpretation to interpret a provision in law, the court should give full effect to the language

used by the legislature. If the language of the legislature is clear and unambiguous, the court cannot

read words into the Act in interpreting the same. Further, where the language is plain, the task of

interpretation will not arise.

A similar view was expressed in Somawathie v Weerasinghe [1990] 2 SLR 121 at page 124,

where it was held;

How should the words of this provision of the Constitution be construed? It should

be construed according to the intent of the makers of the Constitution. Where, as in

the Article before us, the words are in themselves precise and unambiguous and

19

there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the Constitution,

the words themselves do best declare that intention. No more can be necessary than

to expound those words in their plain, natural, ordinary, grammatical and literal

sense.

(c) Cursus curiae est lex curiae (The practice of the court is the law of the court)

As the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, etc. were not created as legal

persons that can sue and be sued, a curses curie est lex curiae has been developed in Sri Lankan

courts that legal proceedings can be instituted against the members of such commissions. In this

regard, it is pertinent to note that it has been the practice of this court to entertain not only the

Fundamental Rights Applications filed against the members of the Election Commission but also

to entertain Writ Applications filed against the members of some of the said commissions under

the Constitution.

Brooms Legal Maxims (10th Edition) at page 82 states;

Every Court is the guardian of its own records and master of its own practice;

and where a practice had existed it is convenient, except in cases of extreme

urgency and necessity to adhere to it, because it is the practice, even though no

reason can be assigned for it; for an inveterate practice in the law generally stands

upon principles that are founded in justice and convenience.

Further, in Jeyraj Fernandopulle v De Silva and Others [1999] 1 SLR 83, Amerasinghe, J held;

Cursus curiae est lex curiae. The practice of the court is the law of the Court.

Wessels, J in Wayland v Transvaal Government, held that it is no argument to say

that there was no actual contested case in which this procedure has been laid down;

for a course of procedure may be adopted and hold good even though there has

been no decision on the point. However, in Sri Lanka the practice of the Court has

been recognized in judgments of the Court.

The practice of the Court in these matters is in accordance with the conventions of

judicial comity.

20

Thus, for the reasons stated above, I am of the opinion that the petitioners are entitled to name the

members of the Election Commission as respondents by following the cursus curiae of the court.

(d) Applicability of the Interpretation Ordinance to Constitutional Interpretation

The Constitution states that it is the Supreme Law of the Republic. Thus, other laws cannot be

used to interpret the provisions of the Constitution, as they are subordinate to the Constitution. On

the contrary, the other laws should be interpreted to be consistent with the provisions of the

Constitution.

In SC Reference 01/2014, it was observed; . the rules pertaining to

Constitutional interpretation are different to those of statutory interpretation. In this context, it is

relevant to quote His Lordship Justice Sharvananda CJ in his publication on Fundamental Rights

in Sri Lanka (Arnolds International Printing House), 1993 at page 43, in the following terms;

Though the Interpretation Ordinance does not apply to the Interpretation of the

provisions of the Constitution, as the Constitution was enacted in the exercise of

Constitutional power and not in the exercise of legislative power of Parliament and

hence is not written law within the meaning of section 2 of the Interpretation

Ordinance, it may legitimately be referred to, to appreciate the concept of person

in our law.

[emphasis added]

(e) Applicability of the principals in other laws to Constitutional Interpretation

Further, as stated above, since the Constitution is the supreme law of the country, it is not possible

to apply the principles of interpretation of other laws to interpret the Constitution. A similar view

was expressed in Julliard v Greenman 10 US 421 at page 439, where it was held;

A Constitution ... is not to be interpreted with the strictness of private contract.

The Constitution of the United States, by apt words of designation or general

description, marks the outlines of the powers granted to the national legislature;

but it does not undertake, with the precision and detail of a Code of laws, to

21

enumerate the sub-division of those powers, or to specify all the means by which

they may be carried into execution.

[emphasis added]

Therefore, I am not inclined to agree that the Election Commission has been conferred with legal

status directly or by necessary implication. Hence, I hold that the Election Commission is not a

corporate sole. Further, the petitioners are not in breach of Rule 44 of the Supreme Court Rules as

the Election Commission does not have an independent legal status from its members. Therefore,

the aforesaid preliminary objection raised by the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General is

overruled.

DOES THE COURT LACK JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE APPLICATION

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the 14th respondent in SC/FR/90/2023 drew the

attention of court to paragraph 32 of the petition filed in SC/FR/90/2023, the press release dated

24th of February, 2023 produced marked as P21 and the Hansard dated 23rd of February, 2023

marked and produced as P20(b) and submitted that the subject matter of the said application is

now before the Parliament and therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to hear the said application.

The said paragraph 32 states;

The petitioners state that on 24.02.2023 the Election Commission released a press

release informing of two decisions made by the Election Commission at its meeting

held on 24.02.2023, namely (l) that for reasons beyond the control of the Election

Commission the local authorities election will not be held on 09.03.2023 and a fresh

date for the election would be notified on 03.03.2023 and (2) that to make a request

to the Speaker of Parliament to intervene to obtain finances from the Treasury for

the conduct of the election.

A true copy of the said press release dated 24.02.2023 was annexed to the petition marked

as P21 and pleaded as part and parcel hereof.

The said press release stated inter alia as follows;

2023.02.24

22

2023.03.09

;

2023.03.09

,

2023.03.03 ;

[emphasis added]

Further, the learned Presidents Counsel referred to the newspaper article dated 24th of February,

2023 marked and produced as P20(a), which inter alia stated as follows;

The Parliament has asked to appoint a select committee on this matter. So I request

to appoint it, record all and take the report to the Supreme Court. According to

section 4 of the Constitution, the financial power is vested in the Parliament. After

the 1688 Revolution according to the Magna Carter Agreement, all monetary

powers vested in Parliament. Therefore, given that report to Supreme Court through

a select committee.

Further, after the Order on the preliminary objection was reserved by court, the Instructing

Attorney for the said 14th respondent filed a motion dated 22nd of June, 2023 and furnished a copy

of the ADDENDUM TO THE ORDER BOOK No. 1 OF PARLIAMENT issued on the 15th of

February, 2023 which contained, inter alia, the following;

ADDENDUM TO THE ORDER BOOK No. 1

OF

PARLIAMENT

Issued on Wednesday, February 15, 2023

NOTICE OF MOTIONS FOR WHICH NO DATES HAVE BEEN FIXED

And whereas the Election Commission is responsible to Parliament under Article 104B

(3) of the Constitution;

And whereas by Article 30(4) of the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution the

members of the Commission have ceased to hold office and are exercising and discharging of

powers and functions of the transitionary members;

And whereas on 18th January 2023 the Election Commission purported to call

nominations for the Local Authorities Elections;

And whereas two members of the Commission decided to fix 09tg March 2023 as the

date of polling and claimed to have obtained the consent of the other three members;

And whereas the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and

National Policies has filed an Affidavit in Court stating that it would be challenging to find

funds for holding such an election in March 2023;

And whereas there is a question of whether the Commission itself is satisfied that all

preconditions for holding such an election are fulfilled;

tendered her resignation to the President;

And whereas the Commission has failed to report. to Parliament which is responsible

for public finance on issues that have arisen on Local Authorities Elections:

And whereas if the privileges of the Members of Parliament and of the Parliament have

been infringed, it should be investigated into and suitable recommendations in that regard

should be made;

This Parliament resolves that a Select Committee of Parliament be appointed to

investigate into the matters relating to the Election Commission in respect of the incidents of

I have considered the aforementioned preliminary objection raised by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 14th respondent in SC/FR/90/2023 and the submissions made by the learned

Presidents Counsel who is appearing for the petitioners in SC/FR/90/2023, and I am of the view

that if the subject matter of a court case is pending before the Parliament, the courts have no

jurisdiction to hear and determine such a case in terms of section 3 of the Parliamentary (Powers

and Privileges) Act read with Article 67 of the Constitution. A similar view was expressed by

Justice Marsoof PC in the aforementioned Fundamental Rights Applications. However, there are

no sufficient materials before this court to consider the merits of the said preliminary objection.

Further, the said preliminary objection should be considered after hearing all the parties in the

application. Thus, I am not inclined to uphold the said preliminary objection. However, the said

respondent has the liberty to raise the said objection if leave is granted by court after hearing the

merits of the said application.
