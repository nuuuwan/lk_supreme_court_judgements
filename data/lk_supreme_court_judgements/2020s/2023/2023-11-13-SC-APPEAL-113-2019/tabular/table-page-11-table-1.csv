"Further, the High Court held as follows;"
"“The 1st, 2nd, 3rd Defendants and 4th Defendant have shown a relationship up to the Defendants but"
"they were unable to establish their relationship and its connection to the land in partition by evidence."
"Although they stated that they were in possession it is uncertain whether it is permissive or prescriptive”."
"As a result, the High Court decided that this land cannot be partitioned in accordance to the partition law"
"and set aside the District Court judgment dated 29/03/2017 and dismissed the partition action but refused"
"to grant reliefs “b” and “c” of the petition of appeal of the 1st to 3rd Defendants which prayed for a re-trial"
"and relief as prayed for in their statement of claim."
"Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff sought leave to appeal"
"from the Supreme Court and, on 25.06.2019 leave was granted on the four questions of law. The said"
"questions of law will be mentioned in the latter part of this Judgment."
"Even  the  learned  High  Court  Judges  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  uncertain  whether  the"
"possession of 1st to 3rd Defendants is permissive or prescriptive. In other words, they also have come to"
"the conclusion that 1st to 3rd Defendants failed in proving prescriptive possession. 1st to 3rd Defendants"
"have not appealed against this finding. On the other hand, as mentioned before, evidence given by their"
"own witness has shown that Kirimudiyanse, the grandfather of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, under whom"
"they claim title to the whole land, had only 1/5th share in the corpus. No acceptable evidence has been"
"placed to show that there was ouster or something similar to ouster in relation to the other co-owners"
"who held the other 4/5th of the Corpus or in relation to the Plaintiff and the 4th Defendant who had shown"
"common  ownership  through  deeds,  and  thereafter,  1st  to  3rd  Defendants  or  their  predecessors  had"
"commenced adverse possession and continued it for ten years. Neither have they shown that they or their"
"predecessors came to the land in a subordinate character and through an overt act change the nature of"
"their possession and commenced adverse possession and continued it for ten years. Thus, it is clear that"
"the claim of title to the corpus through prescription by the 1st to 3rd Defendants cannot hold water."
"Among the grounds given by the learned High Court Judges to set aside the Judgment of the District Court"
"and dismiss the partition action, it is stated that the Plaint has not complied with the section 2,4 and 5 of"
"the Partition Act and the Plaintiff has failed to reveal an original owner and devolution of title that flows"
"from the original owner.  Even the counsel for the 1st to 3rd Defendants in his written submissions has"
"stated that it seems that the Plaintiff has complied with the said sections- vide paragraph 8 of the written"
"submissions  dated  14.12.202021.  Thus,  I  need  not  elaborate  much  on  those  grounds.  However,  it  is"
