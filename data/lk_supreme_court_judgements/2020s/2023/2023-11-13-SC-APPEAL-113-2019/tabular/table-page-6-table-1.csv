"As per the decision in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another V Jugolinija Boal East (1981) 1 Sri L R 18,"
"the documents for which the objections were not reiterated at the close of the opponentâ€™s case become"
"evidence for all the purposes of the case. Moreover, section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)"
"Act  No.17  of  2022  confirms  that  such  deeds  not  objected  by  the  opposite  party  shall  be  admitted  as"
"evidence without further proof. The oldest deed P4 was executed in 1924. As per the evidence given by"
"the Plaintiff, it appears his position is that even though he does not occupy the corpus he has enjoyed his"
"rights by getting his share through produce of the corpus as well as when trees were sold taking the money"
"according  to  his  share.  The  Plaintiff  has  further  stated  that  Ariyapala,  father  of  the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd"
"Defendants, when putting up his house, cut Jak trees and due to his close friendship, he gave permission"
"to cut those trees. The four boundaries found in the Schedules of the said deeds tally with the Corpus of"
"this case. Thus, it is clear that the Plaintiff had placed sufficient evidence to show his paper title to 1/3rd"
"of the Corpus through the evidence given before the District Judge."
"The  Position  of  the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  Defendants  as  per  their  statement  of  claim  seems  to  be  that  one"
"Oushadahamy, the person they claimed as the original owner acquired title by long possession, in other"
"words by prescription, and thereafter, others in their pedigree got title through succession. Section 3 of"
"the Prescription Ordinance is the section that enables a party to an action get a decree on his prescriptive"
"rights. Thus, a Plaintiff, a Defendant or an Intervenient may get a decree on his or her prescriptive title"
"but it is questionable whether a Court can decree that a person who was not a party acquired prescriptive"
"title  somewhere  in  the  past.  [  see  Punchi  Rala  V  Andris  Appuhami  3  SCR  149,  K.D.  Edwin  Peeris  V"
"Kirilamaya  71  N  L  R  52,  Terunnanse  V  Menike  1  N  L  R  200,  Timothy  David  V  Ibrahim  13  N  L  R  318,"
"Kirihamy  Muhandirama  V  Dingiri  Appu 6 N  L  R  197,  Raman  Chetty  et  al  V  Mohideen  18  N  L  R  478]."
"However, I do not intend to say that a party cannot tag on to the possession of his predecessors to claim"
"prescriptive title. In fact, a party can. [ see Terunnanse v Menike 1 N L R 200, Wijesundara and others V"
"Constantine Dasa and Another (1987) 2 Sri L R 66, Kirihamy Muhandirama V Dingiri Appu 6 N L R 197]."
"What I wish to say is that it is doubtful, whether in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, a"
"Court can decree that the so-called original owner, Oushadahamy acquired title by prescription as part of"
"its decree. Anyway, this Court need not go deep into this issue as there was no evidence acceptable before"
"the  learned  District  Judge  to  say  that  Oushadahamy  was  the  sole  original  owner  and  his  grandson"
"Kirimudiyanse became the sole owner through inheritance after Rathranhamy, the son of Oushadahamy,"
"as per the pedigree stated by the 1st to 3rd Defendants."
