"the Plaintiff to include in the plaint a devolution of title that commences from an original owner who had"
"the sole ownership to the corpus or from original owners who had ownership to the entire corpus. It must"
"be mentioned here that it is impractical and impossible to mention an original owner/ original owners"
"who held the property in its entirety many generations ago unless such facts can be found on documents"
"such as deeds or land registry entries because any other reference to such an original owner or original"
"owners has to be depend on hearsay evidence and not on personal knowledge of the fact, and as such,"
"on  such  occasions  the  Plaintiff  may  face  difficulties  in  proving  his  pedigree.  With  regard  to  what  is"
"discussed above it is pertinent to note that Law does not compel one to do impossible things (Lex non"
"cogit ad impossiblia). If one applies the said principle to the case at hand, law does not expect the Plaintiff"
"to reveal what the Plaintiff does not know or cannot ascertain. Now I would prefer to refer to some case"
"laws that has some relevancy to what was discussed above even though some of them were decided in"
"terms of the Partition Ordinance which had similar provisions."
"In Sinchi Appu V Wijegunasekara 6 N L R  1, it was held that a person claiming to be the owner of an"
"undivided share of a land and to be therefore entitled to possession of it, is competent to maintain an"
"action to have that partitioned. Gunawardene V Baby Nona 47 N L R 31 also have expressed the same"
