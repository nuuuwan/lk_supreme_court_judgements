"As per the statement of claim of the 1st to 3rd Defendants, Kirimudiyanse was the grandfather of 2nd and"
"3rd  Defendants  and  father-in-law  of  the  1st  Defendant.  Dangaswela  Pathirannehalage  Piyasena  and"
"Nissanka Arachchilage Dhanapala, (the sons – in – law of aforesaid Kirimudiyanse) and 2nd Defendant,"
"Sudesh  Prasanne  had  given  evidence  on  behalf  of  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  Defendants.  Dangaswela"
"Pathirannehalage Piyasena in his evidence has clearly stated that aforesaid Kirimudiyanse was entitled"
"only to 1/5th share of the corpus and that he does not know who is entitled to the balance 4/5th share."
"He  was  80  years  old  when  giving  evidence  and  was  the  eldest  among  the  witnesses  for  the  1st  to  3rd"
"Defendants. The 2nd Defendant was only 37 years when he was giving evidence. Though he has stated that"
"said Piyasena, his own witness, had given false evidence (at page 143 of the brief), he admits that Piyasena"
"had a better knowledge than him regarding the entitlements to the Corpus and what Piyasena had stated"
"may be correct as he is elder than him- vide page 149 of the brief. The 2nd Defendant further states in his"
"evidence that the Plaintiff and his father, Ariyapala had a relationship and he does not have knowledge"
"regarding any arrangements with regard to property and transactions between them- vide pages 151 -"
"153  of  the  brief.  Aforesaid  Dhanapala  while  giving  evidence  admits  that  he  knows  only  about  the"
"possession and not about the pedigree- vide page 164 of the brief, and he does not know regarding the"
"rights of Kirimudiyanse. None of these witnesses of the 1st to 3rd Defendant has placed any acceptable"
"evidence regarding the sole original ownership of Oushadahamy or thereafter of his son Ratharanhamy."
"In  fact,  due  to  the  evidence  of  aforesaid  Piyasena  with  regard  to  the  ownership  of  1/5th  share  of"
"Kirimudiyanse, which is contrary to sole ownership of Kirimudiyanse at one time, it is difficult to accept"
"the purported pedigree starting from original sole ownership of Oushadahamy as presented by the 1st to"
"3rd Defendants in their statement of claim as true. Even though, there is evidence to show that 1st to 3rd"
"Defendants have occupied the corpus, due to the evidence relating to 1/5th  share of Kirimudiyanse and"
"lack  of  knowledge  with  regard  to  the  relationship  between  Plaintiff  and  the  father  of  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"Defendants regarding the property, it is difficult establish adverse possession to prove prescriptive title as"
"claimed by the 1st to 3rd Defendants, where there is no evidence to show that there is something similar"
"to ouster in relation to the other co-owners. The 1st to 3rd Defendants cannot claim prescriptive title in the"
"abstract, it must be by possession adverse to the true ownership [ see Fernando V Wijesooriya et al. 48"
"N L R  320  and I. De Silva V Commissioner General of Inland  Revenue  80 N L R  292].  True ownership"
"revealed  through  evidence  is  the  paper  title  of  the  Plaintiff  and  the  co-ownership  claimed  by  the  4th"
"Defendant through a deed and inheritance which will be referred to later in this judgment. Now it seems"
"that the 1st -3rd Defendants attempt to argue before this court that there was no proof of co-ownership"
"by  the  Plaintiff.  If  they  challenge  the  Co-ownership  established  through  paper  title,  it  is  questionable"
