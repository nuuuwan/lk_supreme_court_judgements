"allocate shares in the manner described in the Judgment of the District Court based on the proved co-"
"ownership and share entitlements. This cannot be interpreted as acceptance of three different pedigrees"
"as stated in the Judgment of the High Court."
"The 1st to 3rd Respondents in their written submissions taken up the position that the Plaintiff failed to"
"prove common ownership of the land.  As mentioned before in this judgment, the Plaintiff has proved his"
"pedigree and paper title to the corpus. The deeds (P1 to P4) he marked in that regard were not objected."
"As explained before in this judgment these deeds become evidence for all the purposes of this case and"
"the said deeds establish that the Plaintiff has paper title to the corpus. As explained above, the prescriptive"
"claim of the 1st to 3rd Defendants should fail. Thus, the Plaintiff’s entitlement to the undivided 1/3rd has"
"been established and hence his right to possess is also established – see Leisha and another V Simon and"
"another (2002) 1 Sri L R 148. This evidence is sufficient to prove that the Plaintiff is a co-owner. It is not"
"the task of the Plaintiff to prove who are the other co-owners, because by proving his entitlement is only"
"to an undivided 1/3rd , the facts itself indicates that he is a co-owner with owners of other undivided 2/3rd"
"of the corpus. However, the learned District Judge based on evidence has found that 1st to 3rd and 4th"
"Defendants are co-owners to the Corpus."
"For the reasons given above, the questions of law allowed by this Court on 25.06.2019, namely questions"
"of law as mentioned in paragraph 16 (a)(e)(f) and (g) of the Petition dated 30.08.2018 can be answered as"
"follows."
