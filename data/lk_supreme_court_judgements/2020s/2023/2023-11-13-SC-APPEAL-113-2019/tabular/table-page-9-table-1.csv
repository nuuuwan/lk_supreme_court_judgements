"In her judgment, the learned District judge has found that;",""
"•","There  is no dispute  with regard to the identification of the  corpus  among the parties and it  is"
"","depicted as Lot 1 in plan No.437 made by S.N. Senaratne, marked X."
"•","As per the contents of P4 which is a very old deed, at one time 1/3rd of the Corpus belonged to"
"","one Kukule Kankamalage Arnold Hamine and the said 1/3rd share devolved on the original owner"
"","mentioned in the pedigree of the Plaintiff, namely Nallagamage Albert due to the execution of"
"","deed marked P4. Thereafter, due to the execution of deeds marked P1, P2 and P3 said 1/3rd share"
"","now belongs to the Plaintiff."
"•","There  is  no  evidence  to  establish  that  the  original  owner  as  described  in  the  plaint,  namely"
"","Oushadahamy had sole ownership to the corpus."
"•","Although 1st, 2nd and 3rd  Defendants  claimed that they have prescriptive rights  to the  entire"
"","corpus, witness Piyasena who gave evidence on behalf of them has stated that Kirimudiyanse who"
"","was the grandfather of 2nd and 3rd Defendants was entitled only to 1/5th share and the evidence"
"","clearly establishes that 4/5th share of the corpus belongs to others. They have not established"
"","that they have prescriptive rights to the corpus in entirety since there is no evidence of 10 years"
"","possession in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance after something similar to ouster"
"","regarding the other co-owners. Deeds No. 39617 and deed no. 31 establishes that Kirimudiyanse"
"","the  predecessor  of  1st  to  3rd  Defendants  had  a  title  to  the  corpus.  Hence  1st,  2nd  and  3rd"
"","Defendants  are  co-owners  of  the  corpus  and  they  get  the  1/9th  from  the  1/5th  share  of"
"","Kirimudiyanse which was devolved on Ariyapala who was one of the 9 children Kirimudiyanse had."
"","The balance 8/9th of the 1/5th of Kirimudiyanse’s entitlement has to be kept unallotted for the"
"","other siblings of Ariyapala."
"•","There is a lack of acceptable evidence to come to a decision that at one time, Punchirala who has"
"","been described as the original owner by the statement of claim of the 4th Defendant was the sole"
"","owner  of  the  corpus.  However,  Podimenike  and  Appuhamy  in  the  said  pedigree  of  the  4th"
"","Defendant  had  1/5th  each  and  Said  Appuhamy  had  transferred  1/20th  of  the  corpus  to  said"
"","Podimenike by deed No. 11642 marked 4V2. Hence, said Podimenike is entitled to 13/60th share"
