"plaintiff’s action. Therefore, in actual practice it is the usual, and in my view sensible, attitude of the Courts"
"that it would not be reasonable to expect proof within very high degrees of probability on question such"
"as  those  relating  to the original ownership of land. Courts by and large countenance infirmities in this"
"regard, if infirmities they be, in approach which is realistic rather than legalistic, as to do otherwise would"
"be to put the relief given by partition decrees outside the reach of very many persons seeking to end their"
"co-ownership.”"
"The above show that with regard to matters relating to original ownership, Courts have to take a sensible"
"and realistic approach. In the matter at hand, the Plaintiff has shown an original ownership for the 1/3rd"
"he claims. It is not realistic to expect him to reveal what he does not know. He has made the 1st to 3rd"
"Defendants who occupy the corpus as they may have a claim. The claim presented by the said 1st to 3rd"
"Defendants is based on inheritance and prescription. Reasonable Court cannot expect that the Plaintiff"
"could have ascertained the pedigree that gives them rights as it is not recorded anywhere. It must be"
"noted  that  the  partition  Act  provides  for  registration  of  lis  pendens,  public  notice  of  institution  of  the"
"action and notices for the claimants before the surveyor etc. to give notice of the action for anyone who"
"has an interest in the corpus to come and present his claim."
"In that backdrop, I do not find that said grounds that the plaint is not in accordance with the section 2,4"
"and 5 of the Partition Act and the Plaintiff has failed to disclose an original owner and devolution of title"
"from the said original owner cannot be considered as viable grounds to hold that the decision of the High"
"Court is correct. Partition action is intended to terminate the co-ownership. If the Plaintiff can prove that"
"he is a co-owner and his share in the corpus through a pedigree presented to court, it is sufficient to get"
"his  share  partitioned.  It  is  not  necessary  to  prove  that  co-ownership  exist  among  Plaintiff  and  all  the"
"Defendants."
"It  is  true  that  as  learned  High  Court  Judges  have  stated  in  their  judgment  that  the  Plaintiff,1st  to  3rd"
"Defendants and the 4th Defendants have claimed title to the corpus through three separate pedigrees but"
"the  finding  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judges  that  the  learned  District  Judge  accepted  three  different"
"pedigrees cannot be considered as correct because the learned District judge has not accepted a pedigree"
"commencing from the Oushadahamy or Punchirala who are the original owners in 1st to 3rd Defendants’"
"pedigree  and  4th  Defendant’s  pedigree  respectively.  If  the  pedigree  as  presented  by  the  1st  to  3rd"
"Defendant and 4th Defendant were accepted then there could have been a conflict between pedigrees."
"Learned District Judge has accepted the pedigree of the Plaintiff for 1/3rd share which is based on title"
"passed through deeds marked P1 to P4, which deeds were not challenged when tendered in evidence."
