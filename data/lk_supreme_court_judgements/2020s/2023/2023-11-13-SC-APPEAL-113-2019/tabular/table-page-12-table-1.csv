"worthwhile  to make  few  observations  on  those  grounds.  It  appears  that  no  challenge  has  been  made"
"before the District Court on the ground that the Plaint was defective -vide points of contests raised on"
"02.06.2009. In K. Vethavanam and Two Others V J Retnam 60 N L R 20, which refers to a similar provision"
"in a previous Partition Act, it was held that once a plaint is accepted and it is not exfacie defective, the"
"Court has no power to reject it subsequently under section 7,  read with section 4 of the Partition Act"
"No.16 of 1951. It must be observed that in the present Partition Act, even when the  Plaintiff does not"
"show due diligence to prosecute the action, the Court may endeavour to compel the parties to bring the"
"action to a termination and even permit a Defendant to prosecute the action as the Plaintiff- vide section"
"70(1). It shows that the scheme contemplated in the Act is to reach a finality whenever possible once an"
"action is filed without dismissing based on the failures of the Plaintiff. As admitted by the Counsel for the"
"1st to 3rd Defendantsâ€™ Counsel in his written submissions, there does not seem to be any exfacie defects in"
"the plaint."
"Section 2 of the Partition Act states that where any land belongs in common to two or more owners, any"
"one  or more  of  them, may  institute  an  action  for  partition  or  sale  of  the  land  in  accordance  with  the"
"provisions of Law. Thus, any co-owner of a land can institute a partition action. The Plaintiff in his plaint"
"has referred to the chain of deeds by which he claims 1/3rd of the land showing that he has only a share"
"in the land and he has not revealed the entitlement to the balance 2/3rd of the land. He has made the"
"Defendants who are there in the land parties to the action. The contents of the plaint clearly indicate that"
"the Plaintiff claims him to be a co-owner but he does not know how the balance 2/3rd devolve on the"
"other co-owners. I do not see any defect as far as section 2 is concerned."
"Section 4(1)(c) of the Partition Act requires the Plaintiff to include in the plaint the names and addresses"
"of all persons who are entitled to or claim to be entitled to any right, share, or interest to, of, or in that"
"land or to any improvements made or effected on or to that land and the nature and extent of any such"
"right, share or improvements, so far as such particulars are known to the plaintiff or can be ascertained"
"by him. Section 4(1)(d) requires the Plaintiff to include in the plaint a statement setting out the devolution"
"of title of the Plaintiff, and, where possible, the devolution of title of every other person disclosed in the"
"plaint as a person entitled or claiming to be entitled to the land, or to any right, share or interest to, of, or"
"in that land. Section 5 requires the Plaintiff to include in his plaint as parties to the action all persons who"
"to his knowledge are entitled or claim to be entitled to any right, share, or interest to, of or in the land or"
"to any improvement. The phrases that I have highlighted above indicate that what is expected from the"
"Plaintiff is to reveal what he knows or what he can ascertain. The sections referred to above do not require"
