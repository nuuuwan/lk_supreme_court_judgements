E.A.G.R. Amarasekara J

The Plaintiff Respondent Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff) instituted the partition action

No. 18509/P in the District Court of Ratnapura on 13/01/2003 to partition a land called Nugagahadeniya

Godella in extent of 120 perches, which is described in the schedule to the plaint.

As averred in the plaint, the Plaintiffs position is that;

i. The original owner of the undivided 1/3rd of the corpus was Nalla Gamage Albert. The said

Nalla Gamage Albert purchased said undivided 1/3rd share upon deed No. 5903 dated

4

25/8/1924. Thereafter, through deeds No. 17634, dated 26/09/1929, 15362 dated 26/2/1931

and 2342 dated 15/5/1974 executed by predecessors in title referred to in the pedigree of

the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff became entitled to the said 1/3rd share. As per the said deeds said

Albert had conveyed his rights to M.A. Richard Senaviratne and M.M. Don Andiris and said

Senaviratne had conveyed his rights to said Andiris and at the end said Andrias has conveyed

his rights to the Plaintiff.

ii. Plaintiff is not aware of the original owners of the remaining 2/3rd share or how that share

devolved upon other co-owners.

iii. 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants were made parties as they are in occupation of the land claiming

that they have rights to it, but the Plaintiff is unaware as to how they gained such rights.

iv. Though it was revealed through a search in the land registry that certain deeds have been

executed in relation to the corpus, he could not ascertain how the rights in the corpus

devolved on the executants of those deeds or their heirs.

Thus, the Plaintiff prayed for a partition decree to get his 1/3rd share partitioned.

1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendant Appellant Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st,2nd and 3rd

Defendants) filed their statement of claim and stated inter alia that;

I. Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Oushadahamy was the original owner of the land by virtue of his

possession for a long period.

II. As aforesaid Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Oushadahamy died intestate leaving his estate

requiring no administration, his son Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Ratranhamy became the

sole owner.

III. As said Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Ratranhamy died leaving his estate requiring no

administration, his son T.M. Kirimudiyanse became the owner of the entire corpus.

IV. As aforesaid T.M. Kirimudiyanse died intestate leaving his estate requiring no administration,

his children Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Ariyapala, Sumanawathie, Dayawathie, Karunadasa,

Sumanapala, Leelawathie, Karunawathie, Seelawathie and Dharmadasa became the heirs but

by a settlement among the family members, siblings of aforesaid Ariyapala renounced their

rights for the benefit of said Ariyapala. Thus, said Ariyapala became the sole owner.

V. Aforesaid Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Ariyapala died intestate leaving his estate requiring

no administration and his wife 1st defendant Kandegedara Ralalage Podimenike and children

Sudesh Prasanna (2nd Defendant) and Sujith Prasanna (3rd Defendant) became his heirs.

5

Thereby 2nd and 3rd Defendants became entitled to undivided share of the corpus subject

to the life interest of the 1st Defendant.

VI. Aforesaid Defendants and their predecessors have possessed the corpus undisturbed and

uninterrupted for more than 10 years and they have got prescriptive rights in terms of

Prescription Ordinance and they own the structure and plantation depicted in the plan No.

437.

1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants prayed for the dismissal of the action or to partition the land between 2nd

and 3rd Defendants subject to the life interest of the 1st Defendant.

A.G Kusumawathie, 1st Defendant Respondent Respondent who was the 4th Defendant before the District

Court (hereinafter referred to as the 4th Defendant) filed her amended statement of claim on 29/10/2015

and stated inter alia that;

I. Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Punchirala was the original owner of the land and he died intestate

leaving his estate requiring no administration. Thus, his son Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage

Mudalihamy alias Mudiyanse became the owner.

II. Aforesaid Mudalihamy alias Mudiyanse died intestate leaving his estate requiring no

administration and his children Tepulangoda Mudiyanselage Punchimahaththaya, Mohottihamy,

Appuhamy, Dingiri Menike and Podimenike each became entitled to undivided 1/5th share.

III. Aforesaid Appuhamy, out of his 1/5th conveyed 1/20th of the corpus to T.A. Haramanis Appu, W.A.

Luis Appuhamy and to aforesaid Podimenike by deed No.11642 dated 22.06.1927.

Thereafter, the 4th Defendant in her amended statement of claim proceeded to describe her pedigree

while referring to some family arrangements to indicate that she is entitled 23/30 of the corpus. This Court

observes that the 4th Defendant originally filled her statement of claim along with 5th to 8th Defendants in

the original Court who are the 2nd to 5th Defendant Respondent before this Court. In the said original

statement of claim, there was no reference to the aforesaid Deed No.11642.

Action proceeded to trial on one admission and 13 points of contest recorded on 02.06.2009. The only

admission so recorded clearly indicates that there was no dispute as to the identity of the corpus and the

corpus is depicted in plan no.437 made by S.N. Senaratne L.S.

The Plaintiff gave evidence and marked all the deeds referred to in his pedigree in evidence as P1, P2, P3

and P4. Those deeds were marked without any objection. As per section 68 of the Partition Law, formal

proof of the execution of any deed is not necessary where the genuineness of such deed is not impeached.

6

As per the decision in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another V Jugolinija Boal East (1981) 1 Sri L R 18,

the documents for which the objections were not reiterated at the close of the opponents case become

evidence for all the purposes of the case. Moreover, section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)

Act No.17 of 2022 confirms that such deeds not objected by the opposite party shall be admitted as

evidence without further proof. The oldest deed P4 was executed in 1924. As per the evidence given by

the Plaintiff, it appears his position is that even though he does not occupy the corpus he has enjoyed his

rights by getting his share through produce of the corpus as well as when trees were sold taking the money

according to his share. The Plaintiff has further stated that Ariyapala, father of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants, when putting up his house, cut Jak trees and due to his close friendship, he gave permission

to cut those trees. The four boundaries found in the Schedules of the said deeds tally with the Corpus of

this case. Thus, it is clear that the Plaintiff had placed sufficient evidence to show his paper title to 1/3rd

of the Corpus through the evidence given before the District Judge.

The Position of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants as per their statement of claim seems to be that one

Oushadahamy, the person they claimed as the original owner acquired title by long possession, in other

words by prescription, and thereafter, others in their pedigree got title through succession. Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance is the section that enables a party to an action get a decree on his prescriptive

rights. Thus, a Plaintiff, a Defendant or an Intervenient may get a decree on his or her prescriptive title

but it is questionable whether a Court can decree that a person who was not a party acquired prescriptive

title somewhere in the past. [ see Punchi Rala V Andris Appuhami 3 SCR 149, K.D. Edwin Peeris V

Kirilamaya 71 N L R 52, Terunnanse V Menike 1 N L R 200, Timothy David V Ibrahim 13 N L R 318,

Kirihamy Muhandirama V Dingiri Appu 6 N L R 197, Raman Chetty et al V Mohideen 18 N L R 478].

However, I do not intend to say that a party cannot tag on to the possession of his predecessors to claim

prescriptive title. In fact, a party can. [ see Terunnanse v Menike 1 N L R 200, Wijesundara and others V

Constantine Dasa and Another (1987) 2 Sri L R 66, Kirihamy Muhandirama V Dingiri Appu 6 N L R 197].

What I wish to say is that it is doubtful, whether in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, a

Court can decree that the so-called original owner, Oushadahamy acquired title by prescription as part of

its decree. Anyway, this Court need not go deep into this issue as there was no evidence acceptable before

the learned District Judge to say that Oushadahamy was the sole original owner and his grandson

Kirimudiyanse became the sole owner through inheritance after Rathranhamy, the son of Oushadahamy,

as per the pedigree stated by the 1st to 3rd Defendants.

7

As per the statement of claim of the 1st to 3rd Defendants, Kirimudiyanse was the grandfather of 2nd and

3rd Defendants and father-in-law of the 1st Defendant. Dangaswela Pathirannehalage Piyasena and

Nissanka Arachchilage Dhanapala, (the sons in law of aforesaid Kirimudiyanse) and 2nd Defendant,

Sudesh Prasanne had given evidence on behalf of 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Dangaswela

Pathirannehalage Piyasena in his evidence has clearly stated that aforesaid Kirimudiyanse was entitled

only to 1/5th share of the corpus and that he does not know who is entitled to the balance 4/5th share.

He was 80 years old when giving evidence and was the eldest among the witnesses for the 1st to 3rd

Defendants. The 2nd Defendant was only 37 years when he was giving evidence. Though he has stated that

said Piyasena, his own witness, had given false evidence (at page 143 of the brief), he admits that Piyasena

had a better knowledge than him regarding the entitlements to the Corpus and what Piyasena had stated

may be correct as he is elder than him- vide page 149 of the brief. The 2nd Defendant further states in his

evidence that the Plaintiff and his father, Ariyapala had a relationship and he does not have knowledge

regarding any arrangements with regard to property and transactions between them- vide pages 151 -

153 of the brief. Aforesaid Dhanapala while giving evidence admits that he knows only about the

possession and not about the pedigree- vide page 164 of the brief, and he does not know regarding the

rights of Kirimudiyanse. None of these witnesses of the 1st to 3rd Defendant has placed any acceptable

evidence regarding the sole original ownership of Oushadahamy or thereafter of his son Ratharanhamy.

In fact, due to the evidence of aforesaid Piyasena with regard to the ownership of 1/5th share of

Kirimudiyanse, which is contrary to sole ownership of Kirimudiyanse at one time, it is difficult to accept

the purported pedigree starting from original sole ownership of Oushadahamy as presented by the 1st to

3rd Defendants in their statement of claim as true. Even though, there is evidence to show that 1st to 3rd

Defendants have occupied the corpus, due to the evidence relating to 1/5th share of Kirimudiyanse and

lack of knowledge with regard to the relationship between Plaintiff and the father of the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants regarding the property, it is difficult establish adverse possession to prove prescriptive title as

claimed by the 1st to 3rd Defendants, where there is no evidence to show that there is something similar

to ouster in relation to the other co-owners. The 1st to 3rd Defendants cannot claim prescriptive title in the

abstract, it must be by possession adverse to the true ownership [ see Fernando V Wijesooriya et al. 48

N L R 320 and I. De Silva V Commissioner General of Inland Revenue 80 N L R 292]. True ownership

revealed through evidence is the paper title of the Plaintiff and the co-ownership claimed by the 4th

Defendant through a deed and inheritance which will be referred to later in this judgment. Now it seems

that the 1st -3rd Defendants attempt to argue before this court that there was no proof of co-ownership

by the Plaintiff. If they challenge the Co-ownership established through paper title, it is questionable

8

against whose true ownership they claimed prescriptive title. As per section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance it has to be through adverse possession to the title claimed by the opposite party. It must be

further observed that the 2nd Defendant while giving evidence before the District Court, first had tried to

avoid admitting that 4th Defendant Kusumawathie is a relative but later has admitted that 4th Defendant

Kusumawathie belongs to the same Family indicating close relationship vide page 141 of the brief.

Perhaps, his attempt to hide the relationship may be an attempt to hide coownership. The learned District

Judge has given the 1st to 3rd Defendants shares from the 1/5 share which was once belonged to

Kirimudiyanse as revealed by their own witness Piyasena. As they are physically occupying the corpus,

their possession must relate to a lawful right. Only lawful right that is seen from the evidence is the

inheritance to the rights of said Kirimudiyanse.

The 4th Defendant giving evidence, has stated that the Plaintiff and she are co-owners and she has no

objection for allotting 1/3rd share to the Plaintiff. She has also stated that the predecessors in title of the

Plaintiff had rights in the corpus vide pages 241 and 242 of the brief. She in her evidence refers to

occasions where parts of produce were given to her and also to a dispute arose between 1st,2nd and 3rd

Defendants and her regarding cutting of coconut trees- vide page 194 of the brief. The 4th Defendant has

attempted in his evidence to establish a pedigree commencing from one Thepulangoda Mudiyanselage

Punchirala and has marked a deed no.11642 dated 22.06.1927 relating to a share of 1/20th of the corpus.

While giving evidence 4th Defendant has stated that Podimenike and Appuhamy in her pedigree had 1/5th

each at one time.

The learned District Judge after the conclusion of the trial has delivered the judgment on 29/03/2017,

allotting shares to the Plaintiff, 1st,2nd ,3rd and 4th Defendants as follows;

The Plaintiff - 1/3 = 60/180

1st Defendant - 1/90 = 2/180

2nd Defendant- 1/180 = 1/180

3rd Defendant- 1/180 = 1/180

4th Defendant- 13/60 = 39/180

Unallotted Shares;

For Kirimudiyanses children except Ariyapala 8/45 = 32/180

9

For two vendees in deed No.11642, namely Dingiri Menike(Sic) and Louis Appuhamy 2/60 = 6/180

Not proved for anyone 39/180

In her judgment, the learned District judge has found that;

There is no dispute with regard to the identification of the corpus among the parties and it is

depicted as Lot 1 in plan No.437 made by S.N. Senaratne, marked X.

As per the contents of P4 which is a very old deed, at one time 1/3rd of the Corpus belonged to

one Kukule Kankamalage Arnold Hamine and the said 1/3rd share devolved on the original owner

mentioned in the pedigree of the Plaintiff, namely Nallagamage Albert due to the execution of

deed marked P4. Thereafter, due to the execution of deeds marked P1, P2 and P3 said 1/3rd share

now belongs to the Plaintiff.

There is no evidence to establish that the original owner as described in the plaint, namely

Oushadahamy had sole ownership to the corpus.

Although 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants claimed that they have prescriptive rights to the entire

corpus, witness Piyasena who gave evidence on behalf of them has stated that Kirimudiyanse who

was the grandfather of 2nd and 3rd Defendants was entitled only to 1/5th share and the evidence

clearly establishes that 4/5th share of the corpus belongs to others. They have not established

that they have prescriptive rights to the corpus in entirety since there is no evidence of 10 years

possession in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance after something similar to ouster

regarding the other co-owners. Deeds No. 39617 and deed no. 31 establishes that Kirimudiyanse

the predecessor of 1st to 3rd Defendants had a title to the corpus. Hence 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants are co-owners of the corpus and they get the 1/9th from the 1/5th share of

Kirimudiyanse which was devolved on Ariyapala who was one of the 9 children Kirimudiyanse had.

The balance 8/9th of the 1/5th of Kirimudiyanses entitlement has to be kept unallotted for the

other siblings of Ariyapala.

There is a lack of acceptable evidence to come to a decision that at one time, Punchirala who has

been described as the original owner by the statement of claim of the 4th Defendant was the sole

owner of the corpus. However, Podimenike and Appuhamy in the said pedigree of the 4th

Defendant had 1/5th each and Said Appuhamy had transferred 1/20th of the corpus to said

Podimenike by deed No. 11642 marked 4V2. Hence, said Podimenike is entitled to 13/60th share

10

of the corpus which at the end has devolved on the 4th Defendant. The 2/60th conveyed to other

two donees of 4V2, namely, Haramanis and Louis Appuhamy has to be unallotted for them or

people who claims under them. (It appears that the name of Haramanis has been incorrectly

mentioned in the share list contained in the Judgment as Dingiri Menike)

The balance 39/180th share has to be kept unallotted as entitlement of that share was not proved

in favour of anyone.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Defendants appealed to the Civil Appellate High

Court of Rathnapura stating inter alia that:

The learned District Judge has not investigated the title properly,

Learned District Judge has not considered the evidence which established that 1st to 3rd

Defendants have prescribe to the entire land.

Learned District Judge has not evaluated the evidence properly,

Learned District Judge has not considered the fact that when the pedigrees are different and when

the parties claim on different original owners, possession by one owner cannot be considered as

the possession by the other owners.

The 1st to 3rd Defendants prayed for to set aside the judgment dated 29/3/2017 and to grant the relief

prayed for by them in their statement of claim or alternatively to order trial de novo.

The Civil Appellate High Court of Rathnapura delivered its judgment on 25/07/2018 setting aside the

judgment of the learned District Judge dated 29/03/2018 and dismissed the partition action. Honourable

High Court Judges have stated in his judgement inter alia that;

It is clear that the Plaintiff, 1st to 3rd Defendants and 4th Defendant have claimed title to the Corpus

in three separate pedigrees.

The plaintiff has not disclosed who the original owner of the corpus was and a devolution of title

from the Original Owner. He has shown a pedigree only for 1/3rd share of the Corpus. He has failed

to show the common ownership among the Plaintiff and the Defendants.

The Plaint has not complied with the sections 2,4, and 5 of the Partition Act and therefore, plaint

should be rejected in limine in terms of section 7 of the Partition Act.

Acceptance of 3 different pedigrees by the learned District Judge to order partitioning of the

corpus is erroneous.

11

Further, the High Court held as follows;

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd Defendants and 4th Defendant have shown a relationship up to the Defendants but

they were unable to establish their relationship and its connection to the land in partition by evidence.

Although they stated that they were in possession it is uncertain whether it is permissive or prescriptive.

As a result, the High Court decided that this land cannot be partitioned in accordance to the partition law

and set aside the District Court judgment dated 29/03/2017 and dismissed the partition action but refused

to grant reliefs b and c of the petition of appeal of the 1st to 3rd Defendants which prayed for a re-trial

and relief as prayed for in their statement of claim.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff sought leave to appeal

from the Supreme Court and, on 25.06.2019 leave was granted on the four questions of law. The said

questions of law will be mentioned in the latter part of this Judgment.

Even the learned High Court Judges have come to the conclusion that it is uncertain whether the

possession of 1st to 3rd Defendants is permissive or prescriptive. In other words, they also have come to

the conclusion that 1st to 3rd Defendants failed in proving prescriptive possession. 1st to 3rd Defendants

have not appealed against this finding. On the other hand, as mentioned before, evidence given by their

own witness has shown that Kirimudiyanse, the grandfather of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, under whom

they claim title to the whole land, had only 1/5th share in the corpus. No acceptable evidence has been

placed to show that there was ouster or something similar to ouster in relation to the other co-owners

who held the other 4/5th of the Corpus or in relation to the Plaintiff and the 4th Defendant who had shown

common ownership through deeds, and thereafter, 1st to 3rd Defendants or their predecessors had

commenced adverse possession and continued it for ten years. Neither have they shown that they or their

predecessors came to the land in a subordinate character and through an overt act change the nature of

their possession and commenced adverse possession and continued it for ten years. Thus, it is clear that

the claim of title to the corpus through prescription by the 1st to 3rd Defendants cannot hold water.

Among the grounds given by the learned High Court Judges to set aside the Judgment of the District Court

and dismiss the partition action, it is stated that the Plaint has not complied with the section 2,4 and 5 of

the Partition Act and the Plaintiff has failed to reveal an original owner and devolution of title that flows

from the original owner. Even the counsel for the 1st to 3rd Defendants in his written submissions has

stated that it seems that the Plaintiff has complied with the said sections- vide paragraph 8 of the written

submissions dated 14.12.202021. Thus, I need not elaborate much on those grounds. However, it is

12

worthwhile to make few observations on those grounds. It appears that no challenge has been made

before the District Court on the ground that the Plaint was defective -vide points of contests raised on

02.06.2009. In K. Vethavanam and Two Others V J Retnam 60 N L R 20, which refers to a similar provision

in a previous Partition Act, it was held that once a plaint is accepted and it is not exfacie defective, the

Court has no power to reject it subsequently under section 7, read with section 4 of the Partition Act

No.16 of 1951. It must be observed that in the present Partition Act, even when the Plaintiff does not

show due diligence to prosecute the action, the Court may endeavour to compel the parties to bring the

action to a termination and even permit a Defendant to prosecute the action as the Plaintiff- vide section

70(1). It shows that the scheme contemplated in the Act is to reach a finality whenever possible once an

action is filed without dismissing based on the failures of the Plaintiff. As admitted by the Counsel for the

1st to 3rd Defendants Counsel in his written submissions, there does not seem to be any exfacie defects in

the plaint.

Section 2 of the Partition Act states that where any land belongs in common to two or more owners, any

one or more of them, may institute an action for partition or sale of the land in accordance with the

provisions of Law. Thus, any co-owner of a land can institute a partition action. The Plaintiff in his plaint

has referred to the chain of deeds by which he claims 1/3rd of the land showing that he has only a share

in the land and he has not revealed the entitlement to the balance 2/3rd of the land. He has made the

Defendants who are there in the land parties to the action. The contents of the plaint clearly indicate that

the Plaintiff claims him to be a co-owner but he does not know how the balance 2/3rd devolve on the

other co-owners. I do not see any defect as far as section 2 is concerned.

Section 4(1)(c) of the Partition Act requires the Plaintiff to include in the plaint the names and addresses

of all persons who are entitled to or claim to be entitled to any right, share, or interest to, of, or in that

land or to any improvements made or effected on or to that land and the nature and extent of any such

right, share or improvements, so far as such particulars are known to the plaintiff or can be ascertained

by him. Section 4(1)(d) requires the Plaintiff to include in the plaint a statement setting out the devolution

of title of the Plaintiff, and, where possible, the devolution of title of every other person disclosed in the

plaint as a person entitled or claiming to be entitled to the land, or to any right, share or interest to, of, or

in that land. Section 5 requires the Plaintiff to include in his plaint as parties to the action all persons who

to his knowledge are entitled or claim to be entitled to any right, share, or interest to, of or in the land or

to any improvement. The phrases that I have highlighted above indicate that what is expected from the

Plaintiff is to reveal what he knows or what he can ascertain. The sections referred to above do not require

13

the Plaintiff to include in the plaint a devolution of title that commences from an original owner who had

the sole ownership to the corpus or from original owners who had ownership to the entire corpus. It must

be mentioned here that it is impractical and impossible to mention an original owner/ original owners

who held the property in its entirety many generations ago unless such facts can be found on documents

such as deeds or land registry entries because any other reference to such an original owner or original

owners has to be depend on hearsay evidence and not on personal knowledge of the fact, and as such,

on such occasions the Plaintiff may face difficulties in proving his pedigree. With regard to what is

discussed above it is pertinent to note that Law does not compel one to do impossible things (Lex non

cogit ad impossiblia). If one applies the said principle to the case at hand, law does not expect the Plaintiff

to reveal what the Plaintiff does not know or cannot ascertain. Now I would prefer to refer to some case

laws that has some relevancy to what was discussed above even though some of them were decided in

terms of the Partition Ordinance which had similar provisions.

In Sinchi Appu V Wijegunasekara 6 N L R 1, it was held that a person claiming to be the owner of an

undivided share of a land and to be therefore entitled to possession of it, is competent to maintain an

action to have that partitioned. Gunawardene V Baby Nona 47 N L R 31 also have expressed the same

view. In Appuhamy V Samaranayaka 19 N L R 403 at 405, Sampayo J has expressed that section 2 of the

Ordinance which requires the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs to state certain particulars in the plaint, including the

names and residences of all the co-owners and mortgagees, expressly provides that this shall be done so

far as the said matters or things or any of them shall be known to him or them.

It is important to state what was expressed in Magilin Perera V Abraham Perera (1986) 2 Sri L R 208 at

210.

When a partition action is instituted, the plaintiff must perforce indicate an original owner or owners of

the land. A Plaintiff having to commence at some point, such owner or owners need not necessarily be the

very first owner or owners and, even if it be so claimed, such claim need not necessarily and in every

instance be correct because when such an original owner is shown it could theoretically and actually be

possible to go back to still and earlier owner. Such questions being rooted in antiquity it would be correct

to say as a general statement that it could be well nigh impossible to trace back the very first owner of the

land. The fact that there was or may have been an original owner or owners in the same chain of title,

prior to the one shown by the plaintiff if it be so established need not necessarily result in the case of the

plaintiff failing. In like manner if it be seen that original owner is in point of fact someone lower down in

the chain of title than the one shown by the plaintiff that again by itself need not ordinarily defeat the

14

plaintiffs action. Therefore, in actual practice it is the usual, and in my view sensible, attitude of the Courts

that it would not be reasonable to expect proof within very high degrees of probability on question such

as those relating to the original ownership of land. Courts by and large countenance infirmities in this

regard, if infirmities they be, in approach which is realistic rather than legalistic, as to do otherwise would

be to put the relief given by partition decrees outside the reach of very many persons seeking to end their

co-ownership.

The above show that with regard to matters relating to original ownership, Courts have to take a sensible

and realistic approach. In the matter at hand, the Plaintiff has shown an original ownership for the 1/3rd

he claims. It is not realistic to expect him to reveal what he does not know. He has made the 1st to 3rd

Defendants who occupy the corpus as they may have a claim. The claim presented by the said 1st to 3rd

Defendants is based on inheritance and prescription. Reasonable Court cannot expect that the Plaintiff

could have ascertained the pedigree that gives them rights as it is not recorded anywhere. It must be

noted that the partition Act provides for registration of lis pendens, public notice of institution of the

action and notices for the claimants before the surveyor etc. to give notice of the action for anyone who

has an interest in the corpus to come and present his claim.

In that backdrop, I do not find that said grounds that the plaint is not in accordance with the section 2,4

and 5 of the Partition Act and the Plaintiff has failed to disclose an original owner and devolution of title

from the said original owner cannot be considered as viable grounds to hold that the decision of the High

Court is correct. Partition action is intended to terminate the co-ownership. If the Plaintiff can prove that

he is a co-owner and his share in the corpus through a pedigree presented to court, it is sufficient to get

his share partitioned. It is not necessary to prove that co-ownership exist among Plaintiff and all the

Defendants.

It is true that as learned High Court Judges have stated in their judgment that the Plaintiff,1st to 3rd

Defendants and the 4th Defendants have claimed title to the corpus through three separate pedigrees but

the finding of the learned High Court Judges that the learned District Judge accepted three different

pedigrees cannot be considered as correct because the learned District judge has not accepted a pedigree

commencing from the Oushadahamy or Punchirala who are the original owners in 1st to 3rd Defendants

pedigree and 4th Defendants pedigree respectively. If the pedigree as presented by the 1st to 3rd

Defendant and 4th Defendant were accepted then there could have been a conflict between pedigrees.

Learned District Judge has accepted the pedigree of the Plaintiff for 1/3rd share which is based on title

passed through deeds marked P1 to P4, which deeds were not challenged when tendered in evidence.

15

Thus, the learned District Judge has accepted the complete pedigree of the Plaintiff for the 1/3rd share he

claims and found that Plaintiff is a co-owner in the corpus. Thus, there is a balance of another 2/3rd share

in the corpus. Moreover, the learned District Judge, while denying the pedigree commencing from

Oushadahamy to the whole land and prescriptive rights claimed by the 1st to 3rd Defendants, on the

evidence before the court, has found that at one time, Kirimudiyanse was an owner for 1/5th share of the

corpus as a co-owner. Aforesaid 1/5th share belongs to Kirimudiyanse could be accommodated within the

aforesaid balance 2/3rd share. Considering the evidence placed before the District Court, similarly learned

District Judge has not accepted the original ownership of Punchirala as per the pedigree of the 4th

Defendant. Instead, the learned District Judge has come to the conclusion that at one time, Appuhamy

and Podimenike mentioned in the pedigree of the 4th Defendant were entitled to 1/5th share each and at

one time, they were co-owners. Aforesaid 2/5th share belonged to Appuhamy and Podimenike could be

accommodated within the aforesaid balance 2/3rd share along with the 1/5th share belonged to

Kirimudiyanse as a co-owner at one time. After considering the evidence placed before the District Court

learned District Judge has decided that 1st to 3rd Defendants have inherited certain shares as mentioned

in the District Court judgment. Thus, Part of the entitlement of Kirimudiyanse have devolved on the 1st to

3rd Defendants through Ariyapala, one of the children of Kirimudiyanse and rest of the share of

Kirimudiyanse has been kept unallotted for the other children of Kirimudiyanse to be claimed by them or

people who gain rights through them. Similarly, while taking into considering of the execution of deed

marked 4V2 by Appuhamy, the learned District Judge has decided that 1/60 from the Corpus has been

devolved on aforesaid Podimenike making her share entitlement 1/5+1/60= 13/60. The learned District

Judge has decided that said 3/60th has devolved on the 4th Defendant through inheritance. The learned

District Judge has kept the shares that should go to the other vendees in 4V2 unallotted in their name to

be claimed later by them or people who gain rights through them. The learned District Judge has kept

39/180 share unallotted which includes the balance belonged to aforesaid Appuhamy after executing 4V2

and the share for which no original co-owner was proved. Thus, in my view, it is incorrect to say that the

Learned District Judge has accepted three separate Pedigrees. What the learned District Judge has done

was to allot shares as per the proved co-ownership and proved entitlements. In other words, the learned

District Judge has accepted the original ownership for 1/3rd of one Arnoldhamine who was the

predecessor in title to the original owner mentioned in the plaint and also accepted the Plaintiffs pedigree

through which co-ownership for that 1/3rd share devolve on the Plaintiff. Further, it appears that the

learned District Judge has considered on evidence before him that, at one time, Kirimudiyanse, Appuhamy

and Podimenike had 1/5th each as original co-owners. Thus, the learned District Judge has decided to

16

allocate shares in the manner described in the Judgment of the District Court based on the proved co-

ownership and share entitlements. This cannot be interpreted as acceptance of three different pedigrees

as stated in the Judgment of the High Court.

The 1st to 3rd Respondents in their written submissions taken up the position that the Plaintiff failed to

prove common ownership of the land. As mentioned before in this judgment, the Plaintiff has proved his

pedigree and paper title to the corpus. The deeds (P1 to P4) he marked in that regard were not objected.

As explained before in this judgment these deeds become evidence for all the purposes of this case and

the said deeds establish that the Plaintiff has paper title to the corpus. As explained above, the prescriptive

claim of the 1st to 3rd Defendants should fail. Thus, the Plaintiffs entitlement to the undivided 1/3rd has

been established and hence his right to possess is also established see Leisha and another V Simon and

another (2002) 1 Sri L R 148. This evidence is sufficient to prove that the Plaintiff is a co-owner. It is not

the task of the Plaintiff to prove who are the other co-owners, because by proving his entitlement is only

to an undivided 1/3rd , the facts itself indicates that he is a co-owner with owners of other undivided 2/3rd

of the corpus. However, the learned District Judge based on evidence has found that 1st to 3rd and 4th

Defendants are co-owners to the Corpus.

For the reasons given above, the questions of law allowed by this Court on 25.06.2019, namely questions

of law as mentioned in paragraph 16 (a)(e)(f) and (g) of the Petition dated 30.08.2018 can be answered as

follows.

a) Is the determination of the High Court that the plaint should have been rejected in limina as

Plaintiff has not complied with sections 2,4,5 and 7 of the Partition Act, is perverse and

erroneous in law?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

e) Have the High Court Judges erred in law and in facts when the court decided that the land

cannot be partitioned as the Plaintiff has not disclosed the original owner of the land sought

to be partitioned and devolution of title from the original owner?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

f) Have the High Court Judges erred in law and facts when they decided that learned District

Judge erroneously accepted all three different devolutions of title to partition the land?

A. Answered in the Affirmative.

17

g) Has the High Court erred in law and facts when they decided that Plaintiff cannot maintain

this action, in spite of the fact that Plaintiff has established that he has dominium to undivided

1/3rd share?

A. Answered in the Affirmative.

Hence, this Court decides to set aside the Judgment dated 25.07.2018 of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Ratnapura while restoring the Judgment of the District Court.

This appeal is allowed with costs.
