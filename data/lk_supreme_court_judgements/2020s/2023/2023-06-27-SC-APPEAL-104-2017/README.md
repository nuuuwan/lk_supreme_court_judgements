P Padman Surasena J:

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Plaintiffs) instituted action relevant to this case on 14.08.2013 in the District Court of

Jaffna against the 1st Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st Defendant) and the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Defendant) seeking a declaration of title

to the land described in the schedule to the plaint and the ejectment of the said

Defendants from the said land.

As per the first journal entry of the District Court record, upon the Plaintiff filing the

plaint along with summons, the learned District Judge had taken steps to issue

summons on the Defendants returnable on 11.09.2013. Thereafter, the learned

District Judge had taken further steps on several dates when the case was called in

Court. This was with a view of having the summons served on the Defendants. As the

1st Defendant had not responded to summons, the learned District Judge on

20.11.2013 had fixed the case for ex parte trial against the 1st Defendant.

Upon the Fiscal of the District Court reporting his failure to serve summons on the 2nd

Defendant on multiple occasions, the learned District Judge had ordered summons to

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 4 of 11 be served on the 2nd Defendant by way of substituted service. i.e., by pasting the

summons on the door of the house where the 2nd Defendant had last resided.

Consequent to the above order, the Fiscal had reported on 05.02.2014, that the

summons had been served on the 2nd Defendant by way of substituted service. It is

also to be noted that on the same day, i.e., on 05.02.2014, an Attorney-at-Law also

had appeared on behalf of the 2nd Defendant in Court (Journal Entry No. 5) and the

Court had ordered the case to be called in Court on 12.02.2014. When the case was

called on 12.02.2014, neither the 2nd Defendant nor her agent had appeared in Court.

The learned District Judge had then fixed the case for ex parte trial against the 2nd

Defendant as well.

Accordingly, the ex parte trial against both Defendants commenced, concluded and

the ex parte decree was entered on 26.02.2014. Thereafter, the ex parte decree was

served on the 1st Defendant on 22.05.2014 and on the 2nd Defendant by way of

substituted service on 07.05.2014. Upon the ex parte decree being served on the

Defendants, the 1st Defendant on 28.04.2014, had filed proxy, petition and affidavit,

seeking to purge his default and prayed inter alia that the ex parte decree be vacated.

This was sought to be done under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Subsequent to the filing of the above application, when the Court took up the matter

for inquiry, the Plaintiffs had raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of

the said application on the basis that the said application was time barred. Thereafter,

the parties had filed written submissions on the afore-mentioned preliminary

objection. It was thereafter that the learned District judge, by his order dated

19.11.2014, had upheld the afore-stated preliminary objection raised by the Plaintiffs

and proceeded to dismiss the afore-stated application of the 1st Defendant. The

dismissal of the application of the 1st Defendant by the learned District Judge was on

the basis that he is obliged to strictly calculate the 14 days set out in Section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code. The learned District Judge had adopted this course of action

based on the case of The Ceylon Brewery Limited vs Jax Fernando, Proprietor,

Maradana Wine Stores.1 The learned District Judge upon that conclusion had

proceeded to hold that the District Court had no jurisdiction to inquire into the

1 (2001) 1 Sri. L. R 270.

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 5 of 11 application of the 1st Defendant as he had not complied with the provisions in Section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Being aggrieved by the above decision of the District Court, the 1st Defendant

appealed to the Provincial Appellate High Court of the Northern Province praying inter

alia that the said order dated 19.11.2014 of the District Court be set aside.

Accordingly, the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals after the argument of the said

appeal, by its judgment dated 27.01.2016 had decided in favour of the 1st Defendant.

Accordingly, the Provincial High Court of Civil appeal had set aside the order of the

District Court dated 19.11.2014 which upheld the preliminary objection raised by the

Plaintiffs and dismissed the application of the 1st Defendant made under section 86(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code. It had also set aside the ex parte decree. The decision of

the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court was on the basis that section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code does not specify a limitation on the computation of the 14-

day period and therefore when calculating the said 14 days, one must exclude Sundays

and public holidays as per section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code which applies

for similar computations of time. It was on that basis that the Provincial High Court

had proceeded to conclude that the application made by the 1st Defendant under

section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code was not time barred. Accordingly, the

Provincial High Court had taken the view that the District Court had the jurisdiction to

consider the application of the 1st Defendant made under section 86(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

Being aggrieved by the afore-stated judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal, the Plaintiffs sought Leave to Appeal from this Court. After hearing counsel

for both parties, this Court by its order dated 30.05.2017 had granted Leave to Appeal

on the following questions of law.

(a) Have Their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern

Province (Holden in Jaffna) erred in law when they failed to appreciate that the

1st Defendant-Appellant-Respondent has not filed a valid and proper application

within the time limit in terms of Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code?

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 6 of 11

(b) Have Their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern

Province (Holden in Jaffna) erred in law when they failed to appreciate that

Sundays and Public Holidays are not to be excluded in calculating the period

under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code?

(c) Have Their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern

Province (Holden in Jaffna) erred in law when they failed to appreciate that the

provision of [section] 754 of the Civil Procedure Code has no application to the

period specified in Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code in calculating the

period?

(d) Have Their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern

Province (Holden in Jaffna) erred in law when they failed to follow the judgment

of the Supreme Court in The Ceylon Brewery Limited Vs. Jax Fernando 2001

(1) SLR 270?

(e) Have Their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern

Province (Holden in Jaffna) erred in law when they failed to give due

consideration to the Written Submissions filed by the Plaintiffs-Respondents-

Petitioners in the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the Northern Province

(Holden in Jaffna) wherein specific reference was made to the said judgment

reported in 2001 (1) SLR 270?

A closer look at the above questions of law shows clearly that the central question

that this Court must resolve in the instant appeal is as to how a judge should calculate

the period of 14 days stipulated in section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. For

convenience of further discussion on this point, I would reproduce below, section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code which reads as follows:

Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered against him

for default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes application to and

thereafter satisfies Court, that he had reasonable grounds for such default, the

Court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to

proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to

cost or otherwise as to the Court shall appear proper

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 7 of 11 At the outset let me refer to the case of The Ceylon Brewery Limited vs Jax Fernando,

Proprietor, Maradana Wine Stores,2 in which the Supreme Court was called upon to

consider exactly the same issue. In the afore-mentioned Ceylon Brewerys case, the

defendant had been served with the ex parte decree on 03.02.1997 and the

application under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code to set aside the same had

been filed on 18.02.1997. This meant that the application under section 86(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code had been filed on the 15th day (late by one day on strict

calculation of number of days within that period). Thus, the question before the

Supreme Court in Ceylon Brewerys case was whether the period of 14-days provided

in section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code for filing an application to purge the default

and set aside an ex parte decree, must be strictly complied with. When deciding the

afore-mentioned question, the Supreme Court, in that case, also addressed the

question as to how the said 14-days under section 86(2) should be calculated. Indeed,

that was the main issue, this Court had to address in that case, the facts of which I

will briefly set out below.3

The learned Additional District Judge in the case of Ceylon Brewery had vacated the

ex parte judgment and decree granted against the defendants in that case (due to

their default in filing an answer) and had then proceeded to permit the said defendants

to file an answer. This was despite the fact that the application under section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code was filed in that case after the lapse of 14 days. This was

done by the learned Additional District Judge in that case by excluding Sundays and

public holidays when calculating the period of 14-days. The Plaintiff in that case had

challenged the said decision of the learned Additional District Judge in the Court of

Appeal.

The Court of Appeal in the Ceylon Brewerys case having dealt with several questions,

had held that the learned Additional District Judge could not have lawfully excluded

Sundays and public holidays when calculating the 14-days set out in section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Appeal examined

the provisions of law in sections 754(4) and 757(1) of the Civil Procedure Code which

2 Supra. 3 The facts of the Ceylon Brewerys case has been more fully set out in its Court of Appeal judgment which is reported in (1998) 3 Sri. L. R. 61.

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 8 of 11 also contain identical time-limit (14-day period), but had expressly excluded Sundays

and public holidays (unlike section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code). The Court of

Appeal then proceeded to hold that Sundays and public holidays should not be

excluded when calculating the said period of 14 days referred to in section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code.

However, the Court of Appeal in the Ceylon Brewerys case held that the requirement

of 14-days in section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code for an application to set aside

a default decree was merely directory and not mandatory. It was on that basis that

the Court of Appeal proceeded in its judgment to affirm the learned Additional District

Judges order allowing the defendants in that case to file an answer and proceed with

an inter-parte trial despite the application under section 86(2) having been delayed

by one day than the stipulated 14-day period.

Being aggrieved by the afore-stated judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Plaintiffs of

the Ceylon Brewerys Case appealed to the Supreme Court. Thus, the Supreme Court

in that case was called upon to consider the question whether or not the requirement

under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code to make such an application within 14

days is merely directory as held by the Court of Appeal. Having considered the said

question, Justice Mark Fernando in that case stated as follows:

We are of the view that Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code is the

provision which confers jurisdiction on the District Court to set aside a default

decree. That jurisdiction depends on two conditions being satisfied. One

condition is that the application should be made within 14 days of the service

of the default decree on the defendant.

It is settled law that provisions which go to the jurisdiction must be strictly

complied with. See Sri Lanka General Workers Union vs Samaranayake.4

Having stated so, Justice Mark Fernando in the above case, set aside both the

judgment of the Court of Appeal and the order of the District Court and affirmed the

ex parte decree previously entered by the Additional District Judge.

4 1996 2 Sri L. R. 265.

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 9 of 11 In arriving at the decision that section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code is mandatory

and requires strict compliance, Justice Mark Fernando proceeded to hold as follows:

The learned District Judge entertained the application to set aside the default

decree after the period of 14 days had expired, on the ground that intervening

holidays had to be excluded. The Court of Appeal held, correctly, that the

learned District Judge was in error, because intervening holidays cannot be

excluded in computing a period exceeding six days.

Justice Mark Fernando decided the Ceylon Brewerys case in the year 1999. Then

again in SC Appeal No. 153/2014 decided on 10.06.2016, Justice Anil Gooneratne also

reiterated the view that the compliance of the requirement under section 86(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code is mandatory as it has been the intention of the Legislature to

stipulate strictly the 14-day time limit to enable the District Court to assume

jurisdiction to inquire into such applications. This Court has been consistent in taking

that view. Justice Anil Gooneratne in SC Appeal No. 153/2014, followed the afore-

mentioned dicta of Justice Mark Fernando in Ceylon Brewerys case.

I observe that the learned Judge of the Civil Appeal High Court in his judgment has

made a reference to the Plaintiffs written submissions5 and that the said written

submissions had contained a specific reference to the judgement of the Ceylon

Brewerys Case reported in 2001 (1) SLR 270. However, unfortunately, the learned

Judge of the Civil Appeal High Court had failed to give due recognition and apply the

said ratio decidendi when he decided the instant case.

Although the above analysis would sufficiently dispose of the instant case, for the sake

of completeness, let me set out below the applicability of section 8(1) of the

Interpretation Ordinance in respect of calculating the 14-day period referred to in

section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. In doing so, I would first reproduce below,

section 8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance:

Where a limited time from any date or from the happening of any event is

appointed or allowed by any written law for the doing of any act or the taking

of any proceeding in a court or office, and the last day of the limited time is a

5 Vide paragraph 2, Part C of the Judgement dated 27.01.2016.

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 10 of 11

day on which the court or office is closed, then the act or proceeding shall be

considered as done or taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day

thereafter on which the court or office is open.

The Supreme Court dealt with the question whether section 8(1) of the Interpretation

Ordinance would be applicable for the calculation of 14-day period referred to in

section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code in the case of Flexport (Pvt) Limited & two

others vs. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited.6 In that Case, Priyasath Dep PC J7

holding that that section 8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance is applicable when

making an application to purge the default under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code stated as follows:

I am inclined to follow the Supreme Court judgments in State Trading

Corporation V. Dharmadasa,8 Nirmala de Mel V. Seneviratne and others,9

Selenchina v. Mohomad Marikkar,10 which held that if the last date of filing falls

on a public holiday or on a day the court house was closed, the act of filing of

papers could be done or taken on the next date thereafter, the day the court

or office is open. I hold that section 8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance applies

to section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code

In the instant case, the ex parte decree was served on the 1st Defendant on

22.05.2014.11 The 1st Defendant had made the application to set aside the said ex

parte decree on 09.06.2014. The 14-day period as per section 86(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code did not fall on a public holiday. Accordingly, the application of section

8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance would not arise in the instant case. Therefore, I

would not endeavour to engage in any further discussion on that aspect than what

has already been mentioned above.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer all the above questions of law in respect of which

this Court has granted Leave to Appeal in the affirmative. I proceed to set aside the

6 SC Appeal No. 03/2012 decided on 15.12.2014 [Reported in (2014-2) ABH LR 370 SC]. 7 As he was then. 8 1987 (2) Sri L. R. 235. 9 1982 (2) Sri L. R. 569. 10 2000 (3) Sri L. R. 100. 11 Vide Journal Entry No.11.

(SC Appeal 104/2017) - Page 11 of 11 judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court of the Northern Province dated 27.01.2016. I

restore and affirm the order dated 19.11.2014 pronounced by the learned District

judge. The petition filed on 09.06.2014 by the 1st Defendant seeking to purge his

default and praying for the vacation of the ex parte decree filed under Section 86 (2)

of the Civil Procedure Code must stand dismissed on the ground that it was not filed

within the stipulated timeframe. I allow the appeal without costs.
