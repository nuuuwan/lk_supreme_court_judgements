"of  Civil  Appeals  had  proceeded  to  direct  that  the  action of the  Plaintiff be  dismissed.   The"
"Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant in this appeal has challenged the said judgment pronounced"
"by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals."
"A
s has already been mentioned above, although this Court had earlier granted Leave to Appeal"
"in respect of four questions of law, in the course of the hearing, with the concurrence of the"
"learned Counsel for both parties, Court has now formulated the question as to whether the"
"3rd  Defendant  in  the  present  partition  action  has  prescribed  to  the  corpus  of  the  instant"
"partition action. Thus, that is the sole question we have to decide in this case."
"A
t the outset, it must be noted that the Plaintiff had only led the evidence of one witness. The"
"said witness is the daughter of the original Plaintiff who now stands as the substituted Plaintiff."
"F
rom the evidence adduced in this case, it is not the case of the Plaintiff that they had ever"
"been in possession of the corpus of this action. To the contrary, the witnesses for the Plaintiff"
"under cross examination has admitted that neither she nor her mother was permitted to enter"
"into the corpus and indeed were prevented by the 3rd Defendant since March 1963.  She also"
"has admitted that her mother (the original Plaintiff) had attempted to take the possession of"
"the corpus from the 3rd Defendant through some previous litigations. Therefore, it is clear that"
"the Plaintiff has never been in possession of this land since 1963. This is after the Fiscal had"
"handed over the possession of this land to the four persons who became entitled to that land"
"in 1963 by virtue of the Partition Decree in DC Tangalle case No. P 376."
"L
earned President's Counsel for the Plaintiff  relied on an averment in the answer filed in a"
"different case (Case No. L/1189) by the 3rd Defendant in the instant case.  It transpired during"
"the hearing that the original plaintiff Chandrawathi had executed a lease for three years in"
"favour of Thanthirige John in respect of the corpus of this case and it was said Thanthirige"
"John  who  had  filed  the  afore-said  case  No.  L/1189  against  the  3rd  Defendant  seeking  to"
"recover  the  possession  of  the  corpus  of  the  present  action  in  his  capacity  as  the  lessee."
"According to the Paragraph 3 of the Plaint of Thanthirige John in case No. L/1189, this Deed"
"of Lease No. 10518 had been executed on 29-10-1963."
"The following averment No. 3) could be found in the afore-said answer filed in that case (Case"
"No. L/ 1189) by the 3rd Defendant in the instant case."
"â€œanswering Paragraph 3 of the plaint the Defendant denies that Chandrawathi"
"referred to therein has any right to lease both lots 1 and 2 as she is entitled to"
