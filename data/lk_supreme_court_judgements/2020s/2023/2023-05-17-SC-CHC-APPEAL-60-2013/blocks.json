He also gave evidence with regard to the contents of the (V2) agreement, the change of title of the work and royalty granted to Publis Silva considering his expertise regarding the said book. In cross-examination, although a valiant attempt was made on behalf of the plaintiff to discredit this witness alleging that the agreement was an after-thought, the witness was unwavering in his evidence and stood his ground. At the time of giving evidence this witness averred, he was not in the employment of the defendant company but at another leading publishing company.",

However, when the advance payment of Rs. 25,000/= is deducted from Rs. 840,000/= the royalty granted (calculated as per the learned judges computation), the balance amount to be paid would be Rs. 815,000/= and not Rs. 837,500/= as stated in the judgment.
