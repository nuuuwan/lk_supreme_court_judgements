JUDGMENT

Aluwihare PC. J,

(1) The Appellant-Appellant [Hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Section15(11) of the National Gem and

Jewellery Authority Act No.5 of 1993 [Hereinafter the Act] challenging the

decision made by the 3rd Respondent, the Secretary of the Ministry of

Environment.

(2) The gravamen of the Appellant was that the 3rd Respondent, in arriving at his

findings has relied on extraneous material that was not part of the inquiry that

was conducted before him.

(3) If one is to trace back the history of the dispute;

(a) The Appellant applied for a Gemming Licence [Hereinafter referred to as

the Licence] to the 1st Respondent, the National Gem and Jewellery

4

Authority [hereinafter referred to as the Authority], which is the issuing

authority of such licences, in respect of a land called Galamune

Kumbura.

(b) The 4th and 5th Respondents also had made similar applications in respect

of another land known as Dikwelagawa Arawa, which appears to be

contiguous the land the Appellant was interested.

(c) Several other parties had intervened and participated in the inquiry that

was conducted by the Authority and the application for the licence had

been turned down.

(4) Consequently, the Appellant had appealed against the said refusal of the

Authority to the 3rd Respondent, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment

[hereinafter referred to as the Secretary] in terms of Section 15(8) of the Act.

(5) Along with the Appellant the 4th and 5th Respondents also had appealed to the

Secretary, in respect of the refusal to grant the licence to them by the Authority.

The Secretary thereupon had consolidated both applications and had held a

common inquiry in respect of both the appeals which had been held on the

12.09.2012.

(6) The learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that, at the said inquiry,

representations on behalf of the 4th and 5th Respondents [the two other parties

who were seeking licence], the Land Reform Commission and Basnayake

Nilame of the Sabaragamuwa Maha Saman Devalaya [hereinafter referred to as

the Devalaya] were entertained.

(7) Accordingly, the Secretary by his letter dated 21.01.2013, had communicated

his decision [A4] regarding the two appeals by the Appellant and the 4th and 5th

Respondents. The Secretary had come to a finding that the land named

Galamune Kumbura Dikwelagawa Arawa, are one and the same land and had

5

recommended issuing of a licence to the 4th and 5th Respondents, however, the

application of the Appellant was not allowed.

(8) It was argued on behalf of the Appellant that, in arriving at the decision, the

Secretary had relied heavily on the contents of a letter submitted by the

Basnayake Nilame of the Devalya. It was pointed out that the said letter had

been submitted long after the inquiry and the date granted to the parties to

tender written submissions. The impugned letter is dated 13.01.2013 and had

been submitted four months after the inquiry was concluded.

(9) The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued that none of the parties were

privy to the contents of the said letter and furthermore, the position taken by

the Basnayake Nilame in the said letter is contrary to the position he took at the

inquiry.

(10) Although Basnayake Nilame was not a party to the instant Appeal, this court

allowed the application of the Basnayake Nilame to intervene and was added as

a party by its order dated 06.03.2017 and consequently was cited as the 6th

intervenient Respondent.

(11) Among other grounds, the main thrust of the argument on behalf of the

Appellant was that the findings arrived at, by the Secretary upon the inquiry

cannot stand, as there was a blatant violation of rules of natural justice and that,

not only the 3rd Respondent had relied on extraneous matters to arrive at his

conclusions but also none of the parties were given an opportunity to respond

to the representations made by the Basnayake Nilame way after the conclusion

of the inquiry.

(12) On behalf of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, the learned Deputy Solicitor General

submitted that, although 4th and 5th Respondents were issued with a gemming

licence, it was only for a period of one year as it remained suspended in view

of the present case. It was further submitted that, as the said licence has lapsed,

6

the present appeal is now academic and granting of substantive relief prayed

by the Appellant would be futile.

(13) The written submissions filed on behalf of the said Respondents, however, is

silent on the main ground of appeal referred to earlier, namely the

consideration of extraneous material by the 3rd Respondent in arriving at his

findings. The 3rd Respondent has neither refuted the contention of the Appellant

that he considered the contents of the letter submitted by the Basnayake Nilame

after the inquiry nor justified his action.

(14) Sub Sections (8) to (11) of Section 15 of the Act read as follows;

(8) Where the Authority;

(a) refuses an application for a licence made under subsection (3) ;

(b) revokes a licence under subsection (7), (16)

the applicant or the licensee may before the expiry of a period of

thirty days from the date of such refusal or revocation, as the case

may be, appeal to the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister

(hereinafter referred to as the Secretary)

(9) The Secretary may, on any appeal made to him under subsection (8)

(a) allow the appeal and direct the Authority to issue or renew

the licence; or

(b) disallow the appeal.

(10) The Authority shall comply with any direction issued to it under

subsection (9).

(11) An applicant or licensee dissatisfied with a decision of the Secretary

disallowing, under subsection (9), as appeal made to such Secretary

under subsection (8), may appeal from such decision of the

Secretary, to the Supreme Court, within thirty days of the date on

which such decision is communicated to him.

7

(15) The statutory provisions referred to above are unambiguous and the Secretarys

mandate in exercising the powers vested in him by virtue of Section 15 (9) of

the Act is to sit in appeal and review the decision of the Authority in refusing

the licence and to decide whether the refusal of the licence on the material

placed before the Authority is justified or not.

(16) In reviewing the decision of the Authority, the Secretary may permit the parties

to make representation on their behalf, however, as a matter of rule, has to rely

on the material considered by the Authority in refusing the grant of licence. In

exceptional situations, however, may permit fresh material.

(17) In the instant case the reason for the refusal of the licence was twofold;

(1) The land in question was part of the corpus in a partition case [DC

Rathnapura 20008/P] and that the court was yet to deliver the final

judgement.

(2) The Authority was not in a position to clearly identify the respective lots

claimed by the parties. [Vide letter issued by the Authority to the parties

dated 16.03.2012]

(18) The Secretary only had a mandate to consider whether the Authority was

justified in refusing the licences to the applicants on the ground referred to

above. The Secretary, however, in upholding the decision of the Authority in

refusing the licence sought by the Appellant had come to a finding that there is

no distinct land called Galamune Kumbura. In doing so, the Secretary had made

a distinct reference to the assertion made by the Basnayake Nilame of the

Devalaya regarding the impugned lands, in the letter the Basnayake Nilame sent

to the Secretary more than three months after the inquiry was concluded.

8

(19) The Appellants main contention was that the Secretary ought not to have relied

on the contents of the said letter of the Basnayake Nilame without first affording

an opportunity to the Appellant to respond to the said assertions of the

Basnayake Nilame therein. The Secretary on the other hand had overturned the

decision of the Authority in refusing the licence to the 4th and 5th Respondents

and had directed the Authority to issue a licence to the 4th and 5th Respondents.

(20) I am of the view that the rules of natural justice required the Secretary to afford

an opportunity to the Appellant and other parties to respond to the impugned

letter if the Secretary were to act on it, which the Secretary did not do.

(21) As Dr. Sunil Cooray points out [Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka

4th Edition, page 477], The traditional view was that the rules of natural justice

applied only to decisions making process which the courts classified as judicial

and quasi-judicial. Today, that is not quite the idea. Quoting Justice U de Z

Gunawardena in Geeganage v. Director General of Customs [2001] 3 SLR 179,

Dr. Cooray states; that, the theory is obsolescent if not obsolete. Phrases that

have come into use more recently in this context are the duty of fair play duty

of fairness and acting fairly. Justice Mark Fernando remarked, in the case of

Wijayapala Mendis v. Perera [1999] 2 SLR 110 at 148 natural justice is

fairness in action.

(22) In the case of Wijayapala Mendis v. Perera [supra], the Court observed that the

proceedings of the Commission were not strictly adversarial in nature; the

Commissioners had a duty to ascertain the facts themselves. In several instances,

the Commission refrained from calling important witnesses. This duty to

summon and examine important witnesses, is not a separate duty, but part of

the duty to hear, which is the audi alteram partem rule.

(23) I find the Secretary fell into error when he decided to act on the contents of the

letter of the Basnayake Nilame without ascertaining the veracity of its contents

and/or the stand the Appellant took regarding the same. In the circumstances

9

aforesaid I am of the view that the decision of the Secretary which is impugned

in these proceedings cannot be allowed to stand. Accordingly, the decision of

the Secretary [3rd Respondent] A6 dated 18.01.2013 is hereby quashed, and we

direct the incumbent Secretary to reconsider the appeal of the Appellant on its

merits, in terms of Section 15(9) of the Act.
