"aforesaid I am of the view that the decision of the Secretary which is impugned"
"in these proceedings cannot be allowed to stand. Accordingly, the decision of"
"the Secretary [3rd Respondent] A6 dated 18.01.2013 is hereby quashed, and we"
"direct the incumbent Secretary to reconsider the appeal of the Appellant on its"
"merits, in terms of Section 15(9) of the Act."
