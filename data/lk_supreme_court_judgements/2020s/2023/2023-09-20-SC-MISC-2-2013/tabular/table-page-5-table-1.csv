"","recommended issuing of a licence to the 4th and 5th Respondents, however, the"
"","application of the Appellant was not allowed."
"(8)","It was argued on behalf of the Appellant that, in arriving at the decision, the"
"","Secretary  had  relied  heavily  on  the  contents  of  a  letter  submitted  by  the"
"","Basnayake Nilame of  the Devalya.  It  was  pointed  out  that  the said  letter had"
"","been  submitted  long  after  the  inquiry  and  the  date  granted  to  the  parties  to"
"","tender written submissions. The impugned letter is dated 13.01.2013 and had"
"","been submitted four months after the inquiry was concluded."
"(9)","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  argued  that  none  of  the  parties  were"

"","the Basnayake Nilame in the said letter is contrary to the position he took at the"

"","allowed the application of the Basnayake Nilame to intervene and was added as"
"","a  party  by  its  order dated  06.03.2017  and consequently  was  cited as  the 6th"
"","intervenient Respondent."
"(11)","Among  other  grounds,  the  main  thrust  of  the  argument  on  behalf  of  the"
"","Appellant was that the findings arrived at, by the Secretary upon the inquiry"
"","cannot stand, as there was a blatant violation of rules of natural justice and that,"
"","not only the 3rd Respondent had relied on extraneous matters to arrive at his"
"","conclusions but also none of the parties were given an opportunity to respond"
"","to the representations made by the Basnayake Nilame way after the conclusion"
"","of the inquiry."
"(12)  On behalf of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, the learned Deputy Solicitor General",""
"","submitted that, although 4th and 5th Respondents were issued with a gemming"
"","licence, it was only for a period of one year as it remained suspended in view"
"","of the present case. It was further submitted that, as the said licence has lapsed,"
