"Thus, the Plaintiff had relied on three photographs P23 to P25 to show the status of the premises as at"
"01st April 2009 and five photographs P26 to P30 to show the status of the premises as at 20th April 2009"
"with  an  attempt  to  prove  that  the  Defendant  had  failed  to  complete  the  required  renovations  and/or"
"alterations as per the Agreement by the due date i.e., 01-06-2008. The Defendant had not disputed that"
"the photographs depict the relevant premises but had taken up the position that the dates shown on the"
"photographs are fabricated. It is the position of the Defendant that these photographs are ones that had"
"been  taken  some  time  back  when  the  renovation  work  was  in  progress.  In  these  circumstances,  the"
"dates on which these photographs have been taken have assumed the greatest importance. Thus, they"
"have become directly relevant to the main fact in issue in this case, i.e., the issue whether the Defendant"
"was ready to hand over the possession of the relevant premises to the Plaintiff before the agreed date,"
"i.e., 01-06-2008. However, the Plaintiff's main witness himself has established before Court, the fact that"
"these photographs had not been taken on the dates asserted by him ."
"The  Plaintiff  has  also  called  witness  Jayasundera  Mudiyanselage  Dissanayake  to  give  evidence  on  its"
"behalf.  According  to  the  Plaintiff’s  Chief  Regional  Manager  (Yanik  Sajanaka  Fernando),  the  witness"
"Jayasundera Mudiyanselage Dissanayake is the person who has taken three photographs P23 to P25"
"on 01st April 2009 and five photographs P26 to P30 on 20-04-2009. This witness in his evidence has"
"stated  that the photographs were taken on the dates printed on them. However, in view of the admission"
"by Yanik Sajanaka Fernando that his assertion that the photographs were taken on those dates is false,"
"the decision by the learned Commercial High Court Judge not to rely on the evidence of these witnesses"
"is justified."
"The Plaintiff has also called Muthupora Thotage Joseph Mary Anthony Perera to give evidence on its"
"behalf. The said witness is the architect attached to the Plaintiff company. According to this witness’s"
"evidence, when he had visited the premise on 15-05-2008 there was only very little work to be completed"
"and that work would have only taken about fifteen days for completion. Therefore, I observe that this"
"witness has not established the Plaintiff’s case but has been helpful to establish the position taken up by"
"the Defendant."
"Thus, the cumulative effect of all the above circumstances are directed towards justifying the conclusion"
"arrived at by the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court that the Plaintiff has made an abortive"
"attempt to convince Court that the Defendant had failed to complete the required renovations and/or"
"alterations as per the Agreement by the due date i.e., 01-06-2008. Moreover, the Defendant does not"
"accept that the Plaintiff’s witnesses had visited the premises on the dates they claimed to have visited"
"the  said  premises.  The  learned  Judge  of  the  Commercial  High  Court  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  his"
