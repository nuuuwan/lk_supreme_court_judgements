Introduction

The Petitioner filed this application on the basis that the refusal to admit

her daughter to Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, by the 1st Respondent

principal and the 2nd Respondent Chairman of the Appeal Board is a

3

SC/FR/204/2022

violation of her fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

The Petitioners application pertains to grade 1 admission for the year

2022 under the close proximity category vide R1. There is no dispute

about the applicable circulars issued by the Ministry of Education in this

regard. They were marked by the Petitioner P4(a)-(f).

The Petitioners application was summarily rejected even without calling

the Petitioner for an interview stating that the religious quota vacancies

had already been filled vide P8. This is on the erroneous assumption

that the childs religion is Hinduism (vide P21) despite the Petitioner

stating in the application that the child is a Buddhist. The mother of the

child is a Buddhist and the father a Hindu. In any event, the admission

was sought not under the religious percentage category but under the

close proximity category.

Upon the Petitioner taking up this arbitrary decision with the principal,

the Human Rights Commission etc., the application was reconsidered by

the School Appeal Board. However, the Petitioner says that the Appeal

Board did not make an independent decision; instead, it acted in

accordance with the directives of the school authorities.

According to the decision of the Appeal Board marked P14, the Petitioner

obtained a total of 47 marks:

Main documents in proof of residence 02

Additional documents in proof of residence 00

Electoral registers in proof of residence 25

Proximity to the school 20

Total 47

4

SC/FR/204/2022

The Petitioner says she should have been awarded 69 marks instead of 47

marks:

Main documents in proof of residence 10

Additional documents in proof of residence 04

Electoral registers in proof of residence 25

Proximity to the school 30

Total 69

Main documents

At the time of tendering the application, the Petitioner was residing as a

lessee at No. 312/3/2, Orchid Apartments, Havelock Road, Colombo 5.

In terms of Clause 6.1.I of the Public Notice issued by the Secretary of the

Ministry of Education relating to the admission of children to grade one in

government schools for the year 2022 marked P4(f), Lease Agreements fall

into the category of main documents to prove residence, and a maximum

of 10 marks can be earned based on the length of occupation. To clarify,

if the period of occupation exceeds 5 years, the applicant is entitled to the

full marks (10 marks).

The first Lease Agreement pertaining to No. 312/3/2, Orchid Apartments,

Havelock Road, Colombo 5 marked P7(q) is valid from 11.06.2020 to

10.06.2022. The second Lease Agreement pertaining to No. 312/3/2

marked P7(r) is valid from 11.06.2022 to 10.06.2023. The other Lease

Agreements marked P7(m)-(p) covering the period of 10.12.2015 to

10.07.2020 are not relevant to No. 312/3/2, but to No. 312/3/3.

In addition to the aforesaid Lease Agreements, the Petitioner has tendered

the following documents as proof of residence at both No. 312/3/2 and

No. 312/3/3 for more than 5 years.

5

SC/FR/204/2022

1. The Petitioners National Identity Card

2. The Petitioners husbands (childs father) National Identity Card

3. Childs birth certificate

4. Grama Niladhari Certificate

5. Petitioners Bank Account at the Commercial Bank

6. Dialog Bills

7. Childs Fathers HSBC Credit Card

8. Childs Fathers Bank Account at Commercial Bank

9. Childs Fathers Bank Account at BOC

10. Parents Joint Account at Commercial Bank

11. Life Insurance Policy at SLI

12. Certificate of Registration of a Vehicle

13. Revenue Licences relevant to the Vehicle

14. Vehicle Insurance Certificate

15. SLT telephone bills

16. Electoral Registration Certificates

The Appeal Board has awarded only 2 marks for the main documents

(Lease Agreements) because 5 years of residence was established by Lease

Agreements relevant to both No. 312/3/2 and No. 312/3/3 (not only to

No. 312/3/2).

The Petitioners submission is that these two units (No. 312/3/2 and No.

312/3/3) are adjoining units separated by a wall and therefore she should

have been awarded full marks (10 marks) as she had been living in these

adjoining units for over 5 years (from 10.12.2015 to 11.07.2020 at No.

312/3/2 and thereafter at No. 312/3/2 from 10.07.2020) at the time of

submitting the application to the school. This position of the Petitioner

has been amply supported by the Grama Niladhari in his certificate of

residence marked P7(l) and the letter issued by a Licensed Surveyor

marked P6.

6

SC/FR/204/2022

The Petitioner has applied to several other schools and Sirimavo

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya has awarded full marks (10 marks) for the same

Lease Agreements vide P15. Both these schools are governed by the same

circulars.

The Respondents do not challenge this factual position that No. 312/3/2

and No. 312/3/3 are adjoining units separated by a wall, but their

position is that according to clause 6.0(), the documents tendered as

proof of residence should be relevant to the place of residence at the time

of submitting the application (i.e. strictly to No. 312/3/2) and therefore

documents relevant to No. 312/3/3 cannot be taken into account.

In my view, the Appeal Board has viewed the concept of residence in an

abstract sense and has given an overly literal interpretation to that clause.

I acknowledge that granting interview panels the authority to interpret

clauses of the circulars based on their own discretion or preferences might

result in impropriety. However, it does not mean that they are debarred

from giving a purposive interpretation to clauses to give effect to the

intention of the drafter of the circulars. If I may give an example, circular

13/2021 marked by the Petitioner P4(d) has a clause empowering the

interview board to decide on the distance to school depending on the

unique facts of the case before the board:

,

. The petitioner is not challenging the circular; her complaint is that

the application of that circular to the facts of this case by the Appeal Board

is wrong. There is merit in this complaint.

Based on the documents placed before the Appeal Board, I take the view

that the Appeal Board should have awarded the Petitioner 10 marks for

those main documents.

7

SC/FR/204/2022

Additional documents

No marks were awarded for the additional documents (documents other

than Lease Agreements) mentioned above on the basis that the Petitioner

failed to fulfil the requirement of residing at the given address

continuously for a period of 6 years. However, the relevant circulars do

not state that marks for additional documents can be given only if 6-year

period of residence is established. Applicants who are entitled to marks on

main documents can claim marks for additional documents vide last

paragraph of 6.1. I () of P4(f).

.

The Appeal Board at least awarded 2 marks for the main documents.

Therefore they cannot totally reject additional documents.

In terms of clause 6.1.I () of P4(f), the Petitioner can receive a maximum

of 5 marks for the additional documents.

SC/FR/204/2022

The Petitioner claims that she is entitled to 4 marks for the additional

documents and the Respondents have not disputed this claim except to

argue that a 6-year period of residence is required to award marks for

additional documents.

The Petitioner is entitled to 4 marks for additional documents.

Proximity to the school

The Petitioner also argues that she is entitled to receive 30 marks for their

proximity to the school, rather than the 20 marks that were initially given.

The Petitioner claims that out of the 6 schools within the aerial distance,

the aerial distance of St. Clare Primary School and Mahamathya Maha

Vidyalaya falls over the Kirulapana canal, which should be considered a

natural barrier and therefore the actual road distance to those two schools

should be considered rather than the aerial distance. Hence the Petitioner

says 10 marks should not have been deducted to those two schools.

Circular 13/2021 marked by the Petitioner P4(d) was issued after the

Supreme Court judgment in the case of Lyensa Fernando (Minor) and

Another v. S.A.S.U. Dissanayake and Others, (SC/FRA/17/2019, SC

Minutes of 23.03.2021) marked P19. However, circular 13/2021 did not

abolish aerial distance method in calculating the distance from the place

of residence to schools but stated inter alia

, , ,

.

.

This is repeated in clause 6.0 () of P4(f).

The Petitioner in her post argument written submissions defining the term

natural barrier states a natural object that effectively precludes or

deters access. However, Kirulapana canal does not effectively precludes

9

SC/FR/204/2022

or deters access as there is a bridge over the canal facilitating access to

the other side. If this is interpreted in the way the Petitioner now suggests,

that would in my view be discriminatory against all other similarly

circumstanced applicants.

I am not inclined to accept this argument.

Conclusion

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I hold that the decision of the

principal to reject the application on a wrong basis at the threshold level

and thereafter the refusal by the Appeal Board to award the Petitioner the

marks she was entitled to, was arbitrary, irrational and is inconsistent

with the fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal

protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The principal admits that cut off mark was 53. The Petitioner ought to

have received 59 marks.

Main documents in proof of residence 10

Additional documents in proof of residence 04

Electoral registers in proof of residence 25

Proximity to the school 20

Total 59

I direct the 1st Respondent principal to admit the child of the Petitioner to

grade 2 or the relevant grade at Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo within two

weeks from the receipt of the judgment.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the 1st

Respondent principal without delay.

Application is allowed. No costs.
