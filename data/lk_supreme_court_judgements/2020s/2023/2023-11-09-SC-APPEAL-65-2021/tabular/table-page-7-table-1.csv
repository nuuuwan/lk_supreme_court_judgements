"Commissioner General of Labour can refer such disputes for settlement"
"by  arbitration  to  a  Labour  Tribunal.  In  general  terms,  what  practically"
"happens is that when the dispute is referred for settlement by arbitration,"
"the Commissioner General of Labour or the subject Minister is unaware"
"that  an  application  has  already  been  filed  by  the  employee  before  the"
"Labour Tribunal. This seems to be the case in the instant matter as well."
"The application was filed by the appellant before the Labour Tribunal on"
"11.12.2017. As seen from the letter found at page 61 of the appeal brief,"
"the  Commissioner  General  of  Labour  formulated  the  question  to  be"
"tendered  to  the  Minister  on  19.12.2017.  It  appears  that  they  were"
"unaware  of  the  application  before  the  Labour  Tribunal.  Neither  the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Labour  nor  the  Minister  is  a  party  to  the"
"application before the Labour Tribunal."
"Be that as it may, the Labour Tribunal and the High Court are bound by"
"the  Supreme  Court  judgment  in  Eksath  Kamkaru  Samithiya  v.  Upali"
"Newspapers Ltd. However, both the Labour Tribunal and the High Court"
"state that this judgment is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case"
"because  the  application  was  not  “pending”  before  the  Labour  Tribunal"
"when the Minister referred the dispute for settlement by arbitration. The"
"learned President of the Labour Tribunal in his order  clarified that  the"
"Minister  had  referred  the  dispute  for  arbitration  before  the  case  was"
"called in open Court (although in point of fact the application before the"
"Labour Tribunal had been filed prior to the said reference)."
"I have no hesitation in concluding that this is a wrong interpretation. In"
"the  context  of  this  appeal,  “pending”  means  “awaiting  decision”.  This"
"begins not from the date the application is called in open Court but from"
"the date the application is filed in the Labour Tribunal (in this case on"
"11.12.2017)  and  ends  after  the  satisfaction  of  the  order  of  the  Labour"
