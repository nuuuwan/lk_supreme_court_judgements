"difficult to say that it is an interference by the Minister as contemplated"
"by  then  Article  116  (now  Article  111C).  The  Minister  even  may  not  be"
"aware  of  any  pending  application  before  the  Labour  Tribunal  when  he"
"decides to refer a dispute for compulsory arbitration. With the reference"
"for Arbitration, it is the law of the country contained in section 31B(2)(b)"
"that  requires  the  application  before  the  Labour  Tribunal  be  dismissed."
"When  the  factual  position  whether  there  is  an  interference  with  the"
"judicial  process  or  not  depends  on  the  circumstances  of  each  case  as"
"explained above, I do not think relevant sections in the Industrial Dispute"
"Act  should  be  read  with  necessary  adjustments  as  contemplated  by"
"Article 168(1) of the Constitution."
"Thus, in my view, conclusion reached in the decision of Eksath Kamkaru"
"Samithiya  v  Upali  Newspapers  Ltd  and  Others  that  a  reference  for"
"compulsory  arbitration  by  the  Minister  in  terms  of  section  4(1)  of  the"
"Industrial  Dispute  Act  while  an  application  to  a  Labour  Tribunal  is"
"pending,  is  bad  in  law  is  not  correct  unless  there  are  specific  facts"
"revealing  that  such  reference  was  intended  to  disrupt  the  proceedings"
"before the Labour Tribunal."
"It  appears  that  the  only  point  raised  in  appeal  in  the  said  Eksath"
"Kamkaru  Samithiya  Case  was  whether  the  Minister  has  the  power  to"
"refer to an industrial dispute for arbitration in terms of said section 4(1)"
"when there is an application pending in the Labour Tribunal. As such,"
"any view expressed stating that section 31B(2)(b) would apply only to an"
"application made to Labour Tribunal subsequent to a reference made by"
"the Minister to an Arbitrator or to an Industrial Court for settlement has"
"to be considered as obiter.  The refusal of the request made to revive the"
"dismissals  made  in  the  Labour  Tribunal  in  the  said  Eksath  Kamkaru"
"Samithiya  case  further  strengthens  the  fact  that  the  matter  that  was"
"under consideration in the said case was not the application of section"
