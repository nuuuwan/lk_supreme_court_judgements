"Compulsory  arbitrations  are  done  under  the  provisions  of  the  same"
"Industrial  Dispute 
Act.  My 
brother 
judge, 
honourable 
Justice"
"Samayawardhena has referred to section 31B (5) in his draft Judgement."
"In  my  view,  first  part  of  section  31B  (5)  applies  where  the  dispute  has"
"been  referred  to  and  concluded  by  the  Labour  Tribunal.  On  such"
"instances, the workman is not entitled to any other remedy. In fact, if the"
"dispute has been attended and concluded by the Labour Tribunal, there"
"cannot be an existing dispute to ask for any other remedy other than an"
"appeal over the decision of the Labour Tribunal. Second part of section"
"31B (5) refers to instances where the workman has resorted to a different"
"legal  remedy  other  than 
filing  of  an  application  before  the  Labour"
"Tribunal  in  terms  of  section  31B  (1).  Filing  of  an  action  in  the  District"
"Court  may 
fall  within 
that  part  but  as 
reference 
for  compulsory"
"arbitration  can  be  done  without  the  consent  of  the  parties,  I  doubt"
"whether such remedy can be considered as one resorted by the workman."
"In any case, if the dispute has been referred for compulsory arbitration,"
"application  before  the  Labour  Tribunal  on  the  same  dispute  has  to  be"
"dismissed 
in  terms  of  section  31B(2)(b).  Anyway,  I  do  not  see  any"
"relevance of section 31B (5) to the circumstances of this case."
"Even  though,  section  31B(2)(a)  of  the  Industrial  Dispute  Act  has  no"
"relevance  to  the  present  case  before  us,  as  it  contemplates  concurrent"
"discussions  between  the  employer  and  the  trade  union  of  which  the"
"applicant to Labour Tribunal is a member, it is pertinent to note that if"
"the  thinking  behind  the  decision  of  Eksath  Kamkaru  Samithiya  case"
"referred  above  applies 
to 
this  section,  one  can  argue 
that  such"
"discussions  interfere  with  the  judicial  process  and  such  suspension  of"
"proceedings as contemplated in that section is not warranted. In my view,"
"irrespective of the pending case before the Labour Tribunal, law provides"
"for discussions with the employer through the trade union which has a"
"better  bargaining  power  since  solution  based  on  settlement  is  more"
