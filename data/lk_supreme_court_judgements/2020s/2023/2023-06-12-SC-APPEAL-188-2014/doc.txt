This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of the North Western

Province, Kurunegala dated 27.03.2014 which set aside the judgment of the

District Court of Kurunegala, case bearing No: 6014/L dated 30.04.2007.

ThePlaintiff-Respondent-Appellant(hereinafterreferredtoasthe

Appellant)institutedtheinitialactionbeforetheDistrictCourtof

KurunegalaagainsttheDefendants-Appellants-Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondents) seeking a declaration that the Appellant is

entitled to the land described in the schedule to the Plaint, ejectment of the

Defendants from the subject land and claiming damages. The Respondents

sought the dismissal of the Appellants action and claimed prescriptive title

to the property.

3

After the conclusion of the trial, the District Court delivered the Judgment in

favouroftheAppellantandordereddamagesto be paid till vacant

possession is given to the Appellant. Aggrieved by the said decision, the

Respondents appealed to the High Court of the Northwestern Province,

Kurunegala. In the Judgment of the High Court, it was held that the

Appellants action being a Rei Vindicatio action, the Appellant had to prove

the title to the land in the suit and the Deed marked P2 produced by the

Appellant does not refer to the crown grant given to the vendor, the father of

the vendees in P2. The Learned High Court Judges presumed that the land

has been granted under the Land Development Ordinance and questioned

whether the correct legal procedure under the said act was followed by the

vendor of the Deed marked P2 when alienating the land to the Appellant.

Since the crown grant was not produced, their Lordships applied the

presumption in Section 114(F) of the Evidence Ordinance and held that no

title was passed to the Appellant.

The Appellant is before this Court challenging the said Judgment. This

Court by Order dated 17.10.2014, granted Leave to Appeal on the questions

of law stated in paragraph 24 (i) to (vi) of the Petition dated 07.05.2014, as

set out below.

1. Did the High Court of the Northwestern Province Kurunegala err in law in

holding that the Petitioner has not proved the title to the land in the suit?

2. Did the High Court act on assumptions and presumptions which were not

warranted and against the issues raised and the weight of evidence in the

above case?

3. Did the High Court fail to consider that the Respondents were only relying

on the alleged prescriptive right of their Father Karunaratne who was not a

party to the case?

4

4. Did the High Court fail to consider the substance of the defence put

forward by the Respondents namely Jus tertii?

5. Whether the said Judgment of the High Court is against the evidence led

in the case by the Appellant and the Respondents?

6. Did the High Court err in law in holding that the trial Judge has failed to

investigate the title properly and holding in favour of the Appellant?

My analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid questions

of law based on which leave was granted.

The first matter for consideration by this court is whether the High Court

erred in law in holding that the Appellant has not proved the title to the land

in suit. This action indubitably being a rei vindication action, the onus

clearly lies on the Appellant to establish his title to the land in question.

In Abeykoon Hamine v. Appuhamy, (1950) 52 N.L.R. 49, at page 49-55,

Dias, SPJ. quoted with approval, the decision of de Silva v. Goonetileke

(1931) 32 N.L.R. 27, where Macdonell, C.J., had stated that,

There is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration of title

must have title himself. To bring the action rei vindication plaintiff

must have ownership actually vested In him- 1 Nathan p.362, s.

593..Thisactionarisesfromtherightofdominium.The

authorities unite in holding that plaintiff must show title to the corpus in

dispute, and that if he cannot, the action will not lie.

This position was affirmed in Peeris v. Savunhamy (1951) 54 N.L.R. 207,

at page 208 where Dias SPJ. With Gratiaen J. agreeing stated that,

This being an action for declaration of title, and the defendants being

in possession, the burden lay on the plaintiff to prove that she had

dominium to the land in dispute.

5

Further, in commenting on the standard according to which the plaintiff in a

vindication action is required to establish, H.N.G. Fernando J, in Pathirana

v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 N.L.R 169, at page 171 stated that,

I have no doubt that it is open to a lessor in an action for ejectment to

ask for a declaration of title, but the question of difficulty which arises

is whether the action thereby becomes a rei vindicatio for which strict

proof of the Plaintiffs title would be required, or else is merely ono for a

declaration (without strict proof) of a title which the tenant is by law

precluded from denying.

Accordingly, the Appellant has to narrate and prove his title fully in strict

sense. The Respondent has raised two main issues under the first question

of law during the arguments. Firstly, the Appellant has failed to produce the

crown grant mentioned in the Deed marked P2 which the Appellant has

primarily relied on in proving documentary title before both District Court

and Civil Appellate High Court. Secondly, that the Appellant has failed to

prove the identity of the subject matter in the present action.

With regard to the first issue, the Deed marked P2 which the Appellant has

relied upon is a Deed of Transfer No. 117 dated 05.01.1960 attested by

Anton Wilson Amirthanayagam Emmanuel, Notary Public. The vendor in the

said Deed is one Kalukumara Mudiyanselage Banda and it refers to three

allotments of lands namely,

1. Land called Kadurugahamulahene, Dalupothebogahamulahena, and

Dalupothevewaismaththeva depicted as Lots 96, 211 and 215 in Title

Plan No. S 20383 dated 23.02.1948 consisting of 3 Acres 2 Roods 23

Perches (3A-2R-23P) held and possessed by the said Vendor under

and by virtue of Settlement Order No.993 dated 07.12.1948,

2. LandcalledKurundungollahenaandBulugahamulahenayaya

depicted as Lot 156 in Title Plan No.9169 dated 28.03.1951 consisting

of 2 Acres 1 Rood 20 Perches (2A-1R-20P), and

6

3. Land called Konmadehena and Konmadegala depicted as Lots 57 and

58 in the Plan No. 9168 dated 28.03.1951 consisting of 1 Acre 3

Roods 34 Perches (1A-3R-34P) held and possessed by the said Vendor

under and by virtue of Crown Grant dated 19.07.1951.

The subject matter to this action is the third allotment of land which is the

land called Konmadehena and Konmadegala situated at Thittawella village.

As per the position of the Appellant, the said Kalukumara Banda by the

abovementioned Deed marked P2 has transferred the title to the land in

question to H.M.Dingiri Banda, H.M.Bandara Menike, H.M.Mudiyanse and

H.M.Appuhamy.

The said H.M Dingiri Banda, H.M. Bandara Menike, the successors of other

vendees, namely, H.M. Wasantha Piyathilaka Herath, H.M, Seneviratne

Banda, H.M Jayawardhana Banda and H.M Amarasooriya Banda have

amicably divided the land among themselves by Deed No.15911 dated

29.09.1997attestedbyPadmaKumariWanigasooriya,NotaryPublic

accordingtoPlanNo.96213dated31.12.1996madebyH.Wijetunge,

Licensed Surveyor.

By the abovementionedDeed No.15911, H.M. Bandara Menike and H.M.

Wasantha Piyathilaka Herath became entitled to the land marked Lot 1 in

Plan No.96213 consisting of 3 Roods 37 Perches (A0-R3-P37) and they have

transferred their portion of land to the Appellant of the present case by Deed

No.15420 dated 26.02.1997 attested by Padma Kumari Wanigasooriya,

Notary Public.

The issue raised by the Respondents is that the Appellant had failed to

correctly establish the chain of title by not producing the Crown Grant

mentioned in the Deed marked P2.

7

With regard to establishing the chain of title in rei vindicatio action, in

Kanapadian v. Pieters9 S.C.C Vol. ix No. 47-185 Clarence J. stated

that,

where title to land is a circumstance upon which the plaintiff bases his

claim to relief, the intention of the Code is that title should be disclosed

in the plaint so that the defendant may have notice of the case which he

has to meet.

Nevertheless, in the same case it was further stated that,

The defendant might have asked to have the plaint taken off the file,

as not disclosing the title set up. The Defendant however took no

such course, but answered traversing plaintiffs averments as to

ownership and possession and setting up a specific title in

himself.[emphasis added]

In the abovementioned case, the plaintiff failed to disclose how he obtained

title. Even in the absence of such, the court decided to allow the plaintiff to

amend the plaint on the sole basis of the defendants failure to raise

objections at the right time.

In the present case, the Appellant has established the chain of title to the

land in question from 1960 by presenting the relevant deeds and thereby,

has fully disclosed how he lawfully became entitled to the land in question.

Thus, it is noteworthy that none of the documents produced by the

Appellant was objected by the Respondents. Henceforth, the Respondents

answered the averments of the Appellant by setting up a specific title to

himself. As stated by Samarakoon, C.J., in Sri Lanka Ports Authrity and

another v. Jugoilnija Boat east (1981) 1 Sri L.R 18, at page 24,

if no objection to any particular marked document is taken when at the

close of a case documents are read in evidence, they are evidence for all

purposes of law.

8

The above decision was followed by the Supreme Court in the case of

Balapitiye Gunananda Thero Vs. Thalalle Methananda Thero [1997] 2

Sri L.R 101 which stated at page 101 that,

When a document is admitted subject to proof but when tendered and

read in evidence at the close of the case is accepted without objection, it

becomes evidence in the case. This is the cursus curiae.

Therefore, it is evident that the Respondents have neither questioned the

documentary title of the Appellant to the land in question nor have they

objected to any of the documents the Appellant produced as evidence.

Hence, this constitutes an acceptance of the Appellants documentary title

by the Respondents.

Moreover, the Deed marked P2 contains details of the Crown Grant and the

Appellant has also produced the said Crown Grant before this court.

While considering the possibility of accepting fresh document at the appeal

stage, Beatrice Dep v. Lalani Meemaduwa [1997] 3 Sri L.R Ismail J. at

page 379 stated that,

In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial three

conditions must be fulfilled:

i) It must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with

reasonable diligence for use at the trial.

ii) Evidence must be such that if given it would probably have an

important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be

decisive.

iii) The evidence must be such as is presumable to be believed or in

other words it must be apparently credible although it need not be

incontrovertible.

Further, in Endiris de Silva v Arnolis 33 C.L.W 39, Dias J. stated at

page 39 that,

It is, of course, obvious that this right is one which must be very

cautiously exercised butthe court would have less hesitation in

9

admitting such evidence when it consist of a judicial record, or a deed

or a similar evidence which came into existence long before the

dispute arose and the chances of fabrication are extremely

remote [emphasis added]

In the present case, as per the page 5 of the decision of the High Court the

Appellant has stated that he does not possess the said Crown Grant and it

is in the possession of H.M. Wasantha Piyathilake. However, the Appellant

has presented all the deeds in his possession and the Deed marked P2

contains all the material details of the Crown Grant.

In light of these circumstances, this court is of the opinion that the Crown

Grant presented by the Appellant which the argument of the Respondent is

vehemently based upon must be accepted on the following grounds,

i.this Crown Grant bears an important influence on the result of the

case,

ii.it is apparently credible,

iii.the Crown Grant was executed in 1951 long before the dispute arose,

iv.the Deed marked P2 produced by the Appellant mentions the material

details of the Crown Grant. Therefore, there is no room for fabrication

of such,

v.the rejection of such would lead to a miscarriage of justice.

The Respondent has further contended that the Partition Deed No. 15911

which the transferors of Deed No.15420 acquired their title has been

executed on 29.09.1997 which is subsequent to the Appellants title Deed

(Deed No.15420 dated 26.02.1997).

Nonetheless, the Privy Council in The Colombo Apothecaries Company

Limited v. M.A.Peiris and Others Appeal 58 N.L.R 361 at page 361 stated

that,

when a deed of transfer of immovable property is executed at a time -

when the grantor has no title to the property, the subsequent acquisition

10

of title by the grantor would not only give the benefit of such title to the

instrument already executed but would also give the granter the benefit

of priority by the registration of that instrument.

In Rajapkse v. Fernando 20 N.L.R 30, Lord Moulton at page 495 has

stated that,

Where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he

did not at the time possess, but subsequently acquires,, the benefit of

his subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the benefit of the

earlier grantee.

In light of these circumstances, it is evident that the subsequent acquisition

of title by the grantors by the Partition Deed No.15911 gave the title to the

Appellant and the exception rei venditae et traditae applies to this situation.

The second main issue raised by the learned Counsel for the Respondent is

that the Appellant had failed to correctly identify the land in question, and

this must be considered as a fatal weakness in the Appellants action.

In Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef and v. Abdul Majeed Mohamed Mansoor

and another [2010] 2 Sri L.R at page 377-378, Saleem Marsoof J. quoted

with approval, a passage from Willes Principles of South African Laws

(9th Edition -2007) at pages 539-540 which stated that,

.. to succeed with an action rei vindication, which this case clearly is,

the owner must prove on a balance of probabilities, not only his or her

ownership in the property, but also that the property exists and is

clearly identifiable [emphasis added]

In the above case neither the Surveyors of the Plan referred to in the Plaint

nor other witnesses who testified at the trial placed any evidence in

identifying the northern and southern boundaries in the land in dispute.

Hence, it was held at page 384 that,

11

In the absence of such evidence, there is no justification to conclude

thatthe boundaries of the land surveyed by these surveyors as the

land in dispute, tally with the land described in the schedule to the

petition of the Respondents.

In the present case, the land described in the schedule to the plaint

according to the Plan No. 96213 made by H.Wijetunga, Licensed Surveyor

on 31.12.1996 is as follows,

". 96213

The identification of the subject matter was in dispute at the trial and on a

CommissionissuedbyCourt,E.G.A.Edirisinghe,LicensedSurveyor

disputed land is described in the above plan as follows,

..202106

1:

: ,

: 22,

: .,

:

Doubts in regard to the identity of the land sought to be vindicated arises

from the inconsistencies in the northern boundary of the above two survey

plans. However, it is important to emphasize that the H.Wijetunga, Licensed

12

Surveyor who prepared the Plan No.96213 testified at the trial and admitted

that the alleged discrepancy in the copies of the Plan No.96213 marked P (1)

by the Appellant and V (1) by the Respondent was a mistake on his part

(page 273 of the brief). Mr. Wijetunga was also shown the plan prepared by

Mr.Edirisinghe and as per page 284 of the brief he admitted that Lot 5 in

Plan No.202106 is the Tank and beyond that is the land possessed by the

Respondents(..). The Respondent presented

another plan prepared by Rohan Rathnayake, Licensed Surveyor bearing

No.66/2003 which also shows the Tank beyond the Northern boundary of

Lot 1.

As the Licensed Surveyor who prepared the plan referred to in the Plaint has

testified at the court and clearly stated the boundaries of the land, it is

evident that the identity of the land has been properly proved by the

Appellant.

Moreover, the Respondents have argued that according to the Appellants

title deed (Deed No.96213) his total entitlement is only a land of three Roods

and thirty seven Perches (A0-R3-P37) but the land already possessed by the

Appellant as per Plan No.202106 is one Acre one Rood and two decimal nine

zero Perches (A1-R1-P2.90) which is very much more than his entitlement.

However, it must be noted that the land possessed by the Appellant as per

the Plan No.202106 includes his wifes share as well which was admitted in

the court. (page 150 of the brief) Therefore, I am of the view that the

Appellant has correctly proved the identity of the land and his title to the

same.

Hence, in relation to the first question of law, I conclude that the Appellant

has correctly proved his title to the land in question.

13

The second question of law that must be determined is whether the High

Court acted on assumptions and presumptions which were not warranted

and against the issues raised and the weight of evidence in the above case.

The Learned Judge of the High Court has stated in page 5 of his Judgment

that the Deed marked P2 does not refer to the crown grant given to the

vendor, the father of the vendees in P2 and the said crown grant was not

produced in evidence.

In the absence of such, the High Court applied the presumption in Section

114(F) of the Evidence Ordinance in arriving at the conclusion that the

father of the Appellant, the vendor in Deed marked P2 had failed to follow

the correct procedure under the Land Development Ordinance No.19 of

1935. Thereby, no title has been passed to the Appellant, the vendee of the

said deed.

In Hemathilake v Allina and Others [2003] 2 Sri L.R, Somawasa,J at

page 147 stated that,

What section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance provides for is the

common sense advice that court may from a proved fact infer another

fact which it thinks is likely to be true regard being had to human

conduct and the common course of natural events. The particular facts

of each case must be carefully considered before any inference is

drawn under section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance.

In Walimunige John v. State 76 N.L.R 488, G.P.A Silva J. stated that,

But where one witness's evidence is cumulative of the other and would

be a mere repetition of the narrative, it would be wrong to direct a jury

that the failure to call such witness gives rise to a presumption under

section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance."

Further, Dr.U.L.Abdul Majeed at page 721 of his book called Applicability

of the Evidence Ordinance in Civil Action has stated that,

14

Thisillustrationdealswiththepresumptionwhich arises from

withholdingevidenceandfromthespoliationorfabricationor

suppression of evidence. The conduct of the person withholding the

evidence may be attributed to a supposed consciousness that the

evidence if produced would operate against him. An adverse inference

can be drawn against a party if there is withholding of evidence and

not merely on account of the failure of the party to obtain

evidence. [emphasis added]

These authorities elucidates that the court must first be satisfied that the

evidence was available and was withheld before applying the presumption

under Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance. Accordingly, there is no

presumption if the evidence is not within the control of the party failing to

produce it and if it is cumulative of the other.

In the present case, the Appellant has clearly mentioned at the trial that he

does not possess the said Crown Grant and it is in the possession of one,

Wasantha Piyathilake. (page 122 of the brief) This elucidates that the

Appellant never tried to withhold the evidence but rather failed to obtain it

as it was not within the control of the Appellant. Further, it must be noted

that the material details of the said Crown Grant are mentioned at the

schedule of the Deed marked P2. Thenceforth, this document must be

considered as cumulative of the other evidence already produced by the

Appellant.

Hence, I am of the opinion that the presumption that the High Court Judge

acted upon is unwarranted and is against the weight of the evidence of this

case.

The third and fourth matters for consideration by this court can be

examined together as both of these questions of law are on the defence of jus

tertii and the alleged prescriptive title of the father of the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents who is not a party to the case.

15

The Respondent in answering the Plaint of the Appellant in the District

Court has claimed prescriptive title to the land in question. The Respondent

hastakenthepositionthatone,R.Karunarathne,thefatherofthe

Respondents had prescribed the said portion of land. Nevertheless, there are

two main lacunas in their claim. First, the Respondent has failed to give any

definite period with regard to the commencement of their prescriptive

possession. Second, the said R.Karunaratne has not been made a party to

the present action.

With regard to the first lacuna, in S.K. Chelliah v. Wijerathan et al. 54

N.L.R 337, Gratiaen J, at page 342 has stated that,

Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and squarely on

him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive

rights.

This position was affirmed in Sirajudeen and Two Others v. Abbas [1994]

2 Sri L.R 365.

Therefore, it is evident that in the present case, the Respondents cannot

succeed on the prescriptive title to the land in question as they have failed

to provide any definite time period with regard to the commencement of their

prescriptive possession.

When analyzing the second lacuna pointed out, the defence of jus tertii has

been considered as a valid defense in several Sri Lankan Judgments. In

Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy (1894) 3 S.C.R 87, and Dharmalankara

Thero v. Ahamadulebbe Marikkar (1952) 54 N.L.R. 181, the applicability

of this defence under our law was conceded.

16

Nevertheless, in Dharmasena v. Alles [1985] 2 Sri L.R 35, G.P.S. De Silva

J, by citing Timothy David v Ibrahim (1910) 13 N.L.R. 318 with approval,

observed that a party to a suit cannot under Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance set up a title of a third party who has not been joined in the

action.

Similarly, in Luwis Singho and Others v. Ponnamperuma 1996 2 Sri L.R

320 Wigneswaran J. at page. 321 has stated that,

While refusing to accept the submission that jus tertii as a defence in

vindicatory actions is not available under our law, it must be admitted

that jus tertii as a defence in cases filed for Declaration of Title and

ejectment based on the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance would not be available if the third party is not a

predecessor in Title or has not been joined in the action.

[emphasis added]

In light of these circumstances, I am of the view that the Respondents

cannot rely on the defence of jus tertii as the third party; R. Karunaratne has

not been joined in the action.

The fifth question of law that needs to be examined is whether the said

Judgment of the High Court is against the evidence led in the case by the

Appellant and the Respondents.

The decision of the Learned High Court Judge is solely based on the

Appellants failure to produce the said Crown Grant before the court. At

page 5 of the High Court Judgment, it is stated that the Appellant has failed

to substantiate that the said land was granted to the original owner by the

crown and has also failed to reveal when it was granted.

However, it is to be noted that at the schedule of the Deed marked P2 it is

clearly mentioned that the said land was held and possessed by the said

vendorunderand by virtue of Crown Grant dated 19.07.1951. It is

unfortunate that the Learned High Court Judge has failed observe this

17

material detail in the evidence adduced by the Appellant and has thereby,

unwarrantedly presumed that said grant was made after 1951. (page 6 of

the Judgment of the High Court of Kurunegala)

To further prove his title to the land in question, the Appellant in this case

has presented all the relevant deeds as evidence and also has answered the

issues raised by the Respondents with regard to the alleged discrepancies in

the Plans through the oral evidence. (pages 266-279 of the brief)

Nevertheless, none of these evidence were considered by the Learned High

Court Judge in arriving at his conclusion. Further, the High Court Judge

disregarded that the Respondents in the present case has not produced any

evidence whatsoever to substantiate their claim of prescriptive title to the

land in question. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the Judgment of the

High Court is against the evidence led in the case by the Appellant and the

Respondents.

The sixth and the last question of law to be examined is whether the High

Court erred in law in holding that the trial Judge has failed to investigate

the title properly and holding in favour of the Appellant.

As correctly pointed out by the trial judge, the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio

action need not prove anything other than his documentary title to the

corpus. The appellant has produced two deeds, Deed No. 117, where the

original owner transferred the title to the vendees, and Deed No. 15911,

where two of the said vendees transferred their title to the appellant, to

prove his title to the land. It must be noted that none of these documents

were disputed by the Respondents at the trial. To further substantiate his

claim,theAppellantcalledseveralwitnessesincludingtheLicensed

Surveyor who prepared the plans he presented to the court. The trial judge

before arriving at his conclusion has comprehensively analyzed all of such

oral and documentary evidence adduced by the Appellant in proving his title

to the land in question.

18

When considering all the above discussed circumstances, it is evident that

the Appellant in the present case has correctly proved his title to the subject

matter and his claim has met all the requirements in a rei vindicatio action.

On the other hand, the Respondents have failed to bring conclusive evidence

to defend his prescriptive title to the land in question.

Having examined the facts of the case, and the material placed before this

court, I allow the appeal of the Appellant and hold that the Appellant is

entitled to the subject matter of this action. The judgment of the High Court

of Kurunegala dated 27.03.2014 is set aside and the judgment of the

District Court of Kurunegala dated 30.04.2007 is affirmed.
