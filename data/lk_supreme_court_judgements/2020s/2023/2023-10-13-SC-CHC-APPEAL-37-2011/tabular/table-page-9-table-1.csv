"In  Attygalle  and  Another  v Commercial  Bank of Ceylon  Ltd.  [(2002) 1  Sri LR 176],  the"
"Court  of  Appeal  observed  that  the  Companies  Act,  No.  17  of  1982  does  not  have  a"
"provision similar to Section 36(c) of the Companies Act of England 1975 which was in force"
"at that time and which was similar to Section 51 referred to earlier. In Company Law by"
"Kanag-Isvaran and Wijayawardana [2014, at page 79], it has been pointed out that prior"
"to  the  enactment  of  the  present  Companies  Act  in  2007,  and  in  the  absence  of  any"
"provisions in the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982, “ … it was the common law that governed"
"pre-incorporation contracts in Sri Lanka. The common law, as it stood, that governed pre-"
"incorporation  contracts  was  simple.  A  company  had  no  capacity  to  contract  before  its"
"incorporation, for one cannot act before one comes into existence. This was based on the"
"principle that an act which cannot be done by a non-existent principal, cannot be done"
"through an agent. It was also a settled principle in common law that after a company was"
"incorporated it could not ratify pre-incorporation contracts, for the reason that a contract"
"purported to be made by a company which did not exist was considered a nullity in the"
"eyes of the law. ”"
