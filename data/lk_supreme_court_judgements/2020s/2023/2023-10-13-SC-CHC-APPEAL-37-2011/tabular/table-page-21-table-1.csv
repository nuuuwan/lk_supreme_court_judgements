"Although  Senaratne  took  great  pains  to  explain  that  the  1st  Defendant  had  no  liability"
"towards the Plaintiff, he was confronted by the fact that not only had an assurance of"
"payment  been  made  by  the  2nd  Defendant  on  behalf  of  the  1st  Defendant  but  that"
"payments had in fact been made by the 1st Defendant. Even if his explanation that, “as"
"the 2nd Defendant was pending incorporation at that  stage, the payment  was lent and"
"advanced to the 2nd Defendant by the 1st Defendant and the cheque in payment was issued"
"by the 1st Defendant” could be accepted for the first payment in January 2006, it cannot"
"be accepted for the balance two payments as the 2nd Defendant had been incorporated"
"by then. Thus, in my mind, the 1st Defendant had contractually bound itself to the Plaintiff"
"by making all three payments."
