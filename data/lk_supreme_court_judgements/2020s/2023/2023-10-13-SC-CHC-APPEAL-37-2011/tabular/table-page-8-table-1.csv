"The  obvious  aim  of  the  provision  is  to  increase  security  of  transactions  for  third"
"parties  by  avoiding  the  consequences  of  the  contract  with  the  company  being  a"
"nullity. The provision imposes contractual liability on the promoter, and applies even"
"if the new company is never formed. To avoid the promoter's personal liability under"
"the statute, the third party must explicitly agree to forego the protection â€“ consent"
"cannot  be  deduced  simply  from  details  of  the  contract  which,  interpreted  widely,"
"would  be  inconsistent  with  the  promoter  accepting  personal  liability,  such  as  the"
"promoter signing as agent for the company."
