"intention  of  the  1st  Defendant  to  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the  Plaintiff  for  the"
"provision of consultancy services for the Project."
"T
he ‘entry’ of the 2nd Defendant to the transaction takes place on 6th January 2006 by P6."
"Although  not  incorporated  as  at  that  date,  P6,  which  according  to  Abeynayake  was"
"prepared in consultation with Senaratne and Perera, is signed by Abeynayake on behalf"
"of the 2nd Defendant and not only refers to and accepts P4 and P5 but seeks to appoint"
"the Plaintiff as the Consultant for the provision of a Consortium service for the Project on"
"the  terms  and  conditions  set  out  in  P4  and  P5  and  provides  a  specific  assurance  that"
"payments would be made  by the 1st Defendant, with a payment of Rs. 1,500,000 being"
"made almost simultaneously. While P6 does not make the 2nd Defendant liable for the"
"reason  that  the  2nd  Defendant  was  not  incorporated  as  at  that  date,  it  certainly  gives"
"context to the intention of the parties to have the 2nd Defendant involved in the entire"
"transaction."
"T
he  next  document  after  P6 
is  P9  dated  24th  January  2006,  by  which  the  Plaintiff"
"forwarded  the  Preliminary  Construction  Cost  Estimate  to  Abeynayake,  with  the  1st"
"Defendant  being  referred  to  as  the  client.  The 
incorporation  of  the  2nd  Defendant"
"followed two days thereafter on 26th January 2006."
"T
he  next  two 
letters  are  crucial.  The  first 
is 
letter  dated  24th  February  2006  [P12]"
"addressed  to  Abeynayake 
in  his  capacity  as  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant.  By  P12,  the  Plaintiff  requested  the  2nd  Defendant  to  pay  a  sum  of  Rs."
"3,400,000, which was the balance sum of money outstanding on the advance payment of"
"10%. Thus, by P12, the Plaintiff acknowledged the presence and involvement of the 2nd"
"Defendant in the transaction. What followed thereafter – P13 – cements the contractual"
"involvement  of  the  2nd  Defendant  for  the  reason  that  the  2nd  Defendant  not  only"
"confirmed  that  the  payments  are  in  order  but  also  stated  that  “…our  directors,  Mr."
"Sanjeeva Senaratne and Mr. Suminda Perera have approved and  agreed to release the"
"balance money from Neat Lanka (Pvt) Limited, as soon as possible...”. Thus, P13 confirms"
"the position  of  the Plaintiff  that there  existed  an  agreement  between  the parties with"
"both Defendants promising to do the same thing."
