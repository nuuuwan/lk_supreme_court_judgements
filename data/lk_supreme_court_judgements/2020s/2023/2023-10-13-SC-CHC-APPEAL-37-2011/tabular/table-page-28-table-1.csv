"P
ursuant to P13, the 1st Defendant continued to make two further payments by cheques"
"drawn on its account [D8 on 20th March 2006 and D9 on 27th March 2006], even though"
"the 2nd Defendant had been incorporated by then and payments were called from the 2nd"
"Defendant. The explanation of Senaratne was that even though it is the 1st Defendant that"
"made the payments, it was only a loan made to the 2nd Defendant. While this confirms"
"that the services were being performed for the 2nd Defendant, it must be noted that the"
"payments were made directly by the 1st Defendant to the Plaintiff and not through the"
"2nd Defendant. Thus, the position is that the work was carried out for the 2nd Defendant,"
"with the invoices and receipts issued to the 2nd Defendant and for payments to be made"
"by the 1st Defendant."
