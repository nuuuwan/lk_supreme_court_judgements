"10th ed., 2016, Sweet & Maxwell] the position in England with regard to pre-incorporation"
"contracts has been laid down in the following manner [pages 111 to 113]:"
"“As  already  noted,  these  contracts  cannot  bind  the  non-existent  entity,  and  the"
"company,  once  formed,  cannot  ratify  or  adopt  the  contract.  Prior  to  statutory"
"amendments driven by the UK’s entry into the EU, the legal position as between the"
"promoter and the third party seemed to depend on the terminology employed. If the"
"contract was entered into by the promoter and signed “for and on behalf of XY Co"
"Ltd” then, according to the early case of Kelner v. Baxter [(1866) L.R. 2 C.P. 174], the"
"promoter  would  be  personally  liable.  But  if,  as  is  much  more  likely,  the  promoter"
"signed the proposed name of the company, adding his own to authenticate it (e.g."
"XY Co Ltd, AB Director) then, according to Newborne v. Sensolid (Great Britain) Ltd.,"
"[(1954) 1 Q.B. 45 CA] there was no contract at all. This was hardly satisfactory."
