.","The learned DSG for the Respondents submitted, however, that as per the evidence"
"","adduced  before  Court,  labelling  is  done  at  the  time  of  manufacture  itself  by  the"
"","Appellant, and labelling is therefore an integral part of the manufacturing process."
"","He submitted further that it is the same person who manufactures the product who"
"","is responsible for the proper labelling of the product, in terms of Section 2 of the Food"
"","Act,  therefore,  the  manufacturer  is  also  liable  for  any  contravention  of  the  Food"
"","(Labelling and Advertising) Regulations 2005. Accordingly, it was the position of the"
"","learned DSG that the Appellant, being the manufacturer of [bottle of] Ginger Beer"
"","becomes 
liable  for  non-compliance  with  Regulation  02  of 
the  aforementioned"
"","Regulations and as such, the findings, both of the learned Magistrate and the learned"
"","High Court Judge are correct and must be upheld."

"","the  Food  Act  and 
the 
liability 
imposed  upon  parties  by 
the  Regulations  made"

.","Section 02 of the Food Act spells out the liability in general of various stakeholders"
"","who  are  involved  in  distinct/different  processes,  commencing  from  the  point  of"
"","manufacture to the retailer. It is to be noted, however, that Section 02 is not a penal"
"","provision  but  stipulates  a  series  of  conducts  that  are  prohibited.  The  Regulations,"
"","however, not only refer to specific violations, but also spell out penal sanctions that"
"","would  follow  in  the  event  of  any  breach  of  the  same.  In  this  context,  it  would  be"
"","relevant 
to  consider 
the 
intention  of 
the 
legislature 
in  enacting 
the  statutory"
"","provisions referred to above and the regulations made thereunder."
