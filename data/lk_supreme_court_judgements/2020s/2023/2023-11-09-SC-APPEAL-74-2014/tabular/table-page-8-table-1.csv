"13.","In  the  course  of  the  argument,  the  learned  DSG  contended  that  the  Appellant  is"
"","liable  under  Section  2(1)(f)  of 
the  Act,  as 
in 
terms  of 
the  said  provision,"
"","manufacturing,  exposition 
for 
sale, 
storing  or  distribution  of  any 
food 
in"
"","contravention of the provisions of the Act, or any regulation made thereunder is"
"","prohibited. When one analyses Section 2 of the food Act [referred to in paragraph"
"","10 above] it is clear from the words used; “No person shall manufacture, import,"
"","sell,  expose  for  sale.  Store  or  distribute  any  food……….in  contravention  of  the"
"","provisions of this Act or any regulation made thereunder”, that the offences do not"
"","impose strict liability, but the liability is pinned on the ‘person’ who is responsible"
"","for the violation alleged. The reason is a rational one. In the ‘food chain’, different"
"","stakeholders in the industry handle ‘food’ at various points [in the chain] and once"
"","a  particular  stakeholder  [in  the  chain]  loses  control  of  that  'food’,  there  is  no"
"","justification  to  hold  that  stakeholder  liable  for  every  non-compliance  that  takes"
"","place after that particular stakeholder had lost control of the ‘food’, unless it can be"
"","established  that  the  violation  had  taken  place  in  the  hands  of  that  particular"
"","stakeholder."
"14.","Scrutiny of the legal regime relating to regulation of the food industry makes it clear"
"","that  the  legislature  had  been  alive  to  this  fact  and  had  made  clear  provisions  to"
"","ensure that the liability is imposed based on whose responsibility it is to comply with"
"","law at a given point. Thus, it is sine qua non to consider the statutory provisions and"
"","regulations from this perspective to identify who is responsible for compliance."
