"make Regulations in respect of matters governed by the Act [vide Section 32(1)] and"
"such  Regulations  have  been  enacted  from  time  to  time.  Of  those  Regulations,"
"‘manufacturing  and  distribution’  have  been 
specifically  addressed  by  other"
"Regulations 
such  as  Regulation  No. 
FR  1405/3  published 
in 
the  Gazette"
"Extraordinary 1405/3 dated 31.12.2005, Regulation No. FR 1420/4 published in"
"the  Gazette  Extraordinary  1420/4  dated  21.05.2006.  This  observation  is  in  my"
"view, crucial to this appeal for if the legislature intended liability to be imposed on"
"the manufacturer  for matters  which  may  affect  the product  beyond the scope of"
"control  of 
the  manufacturer 
too, 
the 
legislature  would  have  expressed  such"
"intention 
in 
the  Regulations  which 
seem 
to 
spare  no  detail.  Charging 
the"
"manufacturer in relation to a matter which could have occurred at the hands of the"
"retailer or other actor would therefore be futile as it does not serve to enforce the"
"Act  or 
the  Regulations. 
I  am  reminded  of 
the  astute  observations  of 
Justice"
"Sharvananda (as he was then) in Nandasena v. Senanayake and Another [1981] 1"
"SLR 238 at p. 245."
