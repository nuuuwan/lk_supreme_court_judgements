"","2 of the Food Act, the manufacturer is also liable if the retailer sells an item of food"
"","after its expiry date."
"16.  Regulation 2 of the said Regulations under which the Appellant is charged carry the",""
"","identical words; “no person shall sell, offer for sale, expose or keep for sale any food,"
"","t
ransport or advertise for sale, any food contained in a package or container, unless"
"","such package or container is labelled in accordance with the regulations."
"17.  The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant argued that it is clear from the",""
"","above Regulation that the actors who are responsible for the obligations regarding"
"","labelling are persons who “sell, offer for sale, expose or keep for sale, transport or"
"","advertise for sale, any food contained in a package or container”, that this does not"
"","include manufacturers within its scope and  therefore, there is no liability on the"
"","manufacturer  in relation to  any of the obligations that are laid  down in the  said"
"","Regulation."
"18.  The  essential  element  for  any  prosecution  in  respect  of  non-compliance  is  the",""
"","availability of evidence establishing liability. When the Food Act and its regulations"
"","are  examined, 
it  becomes  apparent 
that  the  drafters  of 
this 
legislation  were"
"","conscious of the fact that the industry which was sought to be regulated involved"
"","multiple processes, multiple actors, and multiple concerns. The legislation has been"
"","meticulously drafted to reflect industrial realities. This is evident in the scheme of"
"","the  Act.  For  example,  Section  02(1)  states  that  “No  person  shall  manufacture,"
"","import, sell, expose for sale, store or distribute any food…” followed by subsection"
"","(f) which  states “in  contravention of the provisions of this Act or  any regulation"
"","made 
thereunder”  so  as 
to 
indicate 
that 
the  manufacture, 
importation,  sale,"
"","exposure  for  sale,  storage  or  distribution  of  any  product 
in  violation  of  the"
"","Regulations promulgated under the Act would constitute an offence."
"19.","It was also brought to the attention of the Court by the learned President’s Counsel"
"","for the Appellant  that the Act  empowers the Minister in  charge of the  subject to"
