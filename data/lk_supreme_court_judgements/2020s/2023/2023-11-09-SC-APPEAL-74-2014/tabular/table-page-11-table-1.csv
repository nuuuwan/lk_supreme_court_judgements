"21.  Other than  the rationale  referred to  above,  there  can  be  numerous  reasons as  to"
"why it would be practically possible to make the manufacturer liable in relation to"
"the Regulation in issue. The main reason I see is that, once the product leaves the"
"manufacturer, it loses control of the product and if the product gets deformed due"
"to mishandling of the same by third parties, one cannot hold the manufacture liable."
"Another  would  be  in  instances  where  the  packaging  is  done  by  a  totally  an"
"independent actor over which the manufacture may not have control. This may be"
"true in instances where food is imported in bulk and packaging is done locally. It is"
"for that reason I referred to the fact that the words in section 2 of the Food Act are"
"of vital importance, the liability is on the person who contravenes the Act or the"
"regulation. Whether a person had contravened the provisions can only be decided"
"on evidence and not on surmise."
