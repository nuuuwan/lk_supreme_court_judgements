"to legal interest from the date of instituting action. In the four-paragraph Judgement"
"of  the  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court,  consideration  has  only  been  adverted  to"
"Section  192(1)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  and  the  case  of  Colombo Municipal"
"Council v. Junkeer 71 NLR 85."
"D
espite arriving at the conclusion that Section 192 permits the court to award interest"
"from the date of instituting action, and that the Judgement of the Trial Judge ‘does not"
"specifically mention’ that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover legal interest from the date"
"of action, the learned Judges of the High Court held that the Plaintiffs were entitled to"
"recover legal interest from the date of action, affirming the Order of the additional"
"District Judge."
"S
ection 192(1) states that;"
"“When the action is for a sum of money due to the plaintiff,  the court may, in the"
"decree  order  interest  according  to  the  rate  agreed  on  between  the  parties  by  the"
"instrument sued on, or in the absence of any such agreement at the rate of twelve per"
"centum per annum to  be  paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the"
"action to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal"
"sum for any period prior to the institution of the action, with further interest at such"
"rate  on  the  aggregate  sum  so  adjudged,  from  the  date  of  the  decree  to  the  date  of"
"payment, or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit.”"
"S
ection 192(3) states that;"
"“Where such decree is silent with regard to the payment of further interest on such"
"aggregate sum as aforesaid from the date of the decree to the date of payment or other"
"earlier date, the court shall be deemed to have refused such interest, and a separate"
"action therefor shall not lie.”"
"I
t would be correct to comprehensively interpret Section 192 as follows:"
"The court retains the discretion to award legal interest. Where the court decides to"
"award  legal  interest,  it  may  order  that  such  interest  be  paid  on  the  principal  sum"
"adjudged  from  the  date  of  the  action  to  the  date  of  the  decree,  in  addition  to  any"
"interest to be paid for a period prior to the institution of the action, along with further"
"interest to be paid from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier"
