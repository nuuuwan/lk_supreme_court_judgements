t the outset, it must be understood that legal interest is not a penalty, but is the normal"
"accretion on capital, calculated for a particular period (vide Alok Shanker Pandey vs"
"Union of India & Others [2007] AIR SC 1198). Per Justice Markandey Katju at p. 1199;"
"“For example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10 years ago, but he offers that"
"amount to him today, then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount. Had"
"A
 
paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B would have invested that amount somewhere"
"and earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept that amount with himself"
"and earned interest on it for this period. Hence equity demands that A should not only"
"pay back the principal amount but also the interest thereon to B.”"
