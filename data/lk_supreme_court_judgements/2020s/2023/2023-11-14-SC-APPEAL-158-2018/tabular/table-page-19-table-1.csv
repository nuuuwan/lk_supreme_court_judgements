"opinion of the Court, thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission"
"shall revise the assessment in accordance with the opinion of the Court”"
"The interpretation given to Section 11A(6)  by His Lordship Justice Samarakoon in the"
"case of Cargills Agrifood Ltd v The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue C.A Tax"
"36/2014 (C.A Minutes 28.02.2023) merits consideration. The Court held that;"
"“Hence, any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may,"
"(

determine any question of law arising on the stated case,"
"I

does not say may determine the ‘determination’ of the Commission."
"(
i

)
 
confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the Commission,"
"(

i
)
 
or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court, thereon."
"This may or may not be on the ‘determination’ of the Commission, because the term"
"‘
t
hereon’ refers to ‘any question of law arising on the stated case’."
"What does the next sentence mean?"
"‘
Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission shall revise the assessment in"
"accordance with the opinion of the Court’."
"I
f
 the question of law arose was not with regard to the ‘assessment determined by the"
"Commission’, how shall the Commission ‘revise the assessment’?"
"The answer is, that, the ‘assessment’, referred to in the last sentence is, the ‘assessment’"
"made by the assessor."
"This is why, the previous sentence refers to the ‘assessment determined by the"
"Commission’ but the last sentence just say ‘assessment’."
"The legislature will not waste words as well as it will not use words without a meaning."
"Hence it is clear that,"
"(a) there can be a case stated on a question of law other than the determination of the"
"Commission on tax,"
