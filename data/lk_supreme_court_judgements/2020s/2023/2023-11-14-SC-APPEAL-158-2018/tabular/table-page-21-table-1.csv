"of natural justice or by way of any other preliminary objections, the taxpayer is left with"
"what  he  believes  to  be  an  erroneous  assessment  of  the  assessor.  In  my  opinion,  this"
"interpretation defeats the purpose of the appeal process. The second reason, as advanced"
"by the Appellant, is that the correct tax liability of a taxpayer will be unascertained for"
"extraneous reasons unrelated to the substantive tax issue, and I am in agreement with"
"this view."
"The second possible interpretation is to construe Section 9(10) narrowly as advanced by"
"the Appellant, by limiting the jurisdiction of the TAC and holding that the TAC can only"
"determine issues related to the substantive tax issues. This interpretation would limit the"
"TAC’s jurisdiction to an arithmetic revision and for the reasons explained above cannot"
"be accepted, as the remedy for a taxpayer then would be limited to judicial review and is"
"contrary to a harmonious interpretation of the Tax Appeals Act."
"Of course, it can be argued that although the TAC correctly annulled the determination"
"of the Commissioner – General, the TAC should have considered the substantive tax issue."
"Even the Appellant advanced a similar view in the alternative and stated that the TAC"
"should have provided a decision separately on the preliminary question of law and the"
"substantive matters.  This  view  was  also  expressed  in The Commissioner of General of"
"I

l
and Revenue v. Cargills Food Service (Pvt) Ltd [supra]  at  p.  60  which  was  also"
"concerned with remitting a case, albeit from the Court of Appeal to the TAC, when the"
"TAC annulled the assessment of the Commissioner – General, by upholding a preliminary"
"objection. By virtue of Section 9(10), it appears to me, that the jurisdiction of the TAC is"
"limited to the revision of the assessment of the Commissioner General, therefore, once"
"the assessment of the Commissioner – General is annulled the TAC cannot reassess the"
"assessor’s assessment or in other words consider the substantive tax assessment, thereby"
"exceeding its jurisdiction."
"I am of the opinion that Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act provides two"
"courses of action;"
