"remedy such as a statutory appeal. Secondly, judicial review is concerned with the"
"l
egality of a decision whereas an appeal inquires whether the decision is right or wrong."
"There may be situations where an Appellant in a statutory appeal proceeding wishes to"
"raise questions relating to legality such as the breach of the rules of natural justice or an"
"i
ssue on the jurisdiction of the decision maker. A multitude of judicial authority supports"
"t
he proposition that jurisdictional questions can be raised by way of appeal…….."

"His Lordship Justice Ruwan Fernando also held in The Commissioner of General of Inland"
"Revenue v. Cargills Food Service (Pvt) Ltd [supra] at p. 57 in relation to Section 11A of"
"the Tax Appeals Commission Act that;"
"“It is relevant to note that a party has no absolute right in a judicial remedy where an"
"i
n
f
erior tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction, and where the absence or excess of jurisdiction"
"i
s
 not apparent on the face of the proceedings. It is only discretionary, and depends on"
"various other circumstances, such as laches, or misconduct, misrepresentation or non-"
"d
i
sclosure of facts and acquiescence etc. The grant of a writ is always discretionary and"
"i
s
 
never demandable of right like in a case stated in terms of section 11A(1)”"
"I am in agreement with the views expressed above and, in my opinion, they apply with"
"equal force to Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission. If the Respondent is required"
"to resort to judicial review to challenge a decision of the Commissioner-General, then"
"such an  interpretation would  cause undue hardship and burden to the taxpayer, when"
"an explicit right of appeal is provided[to the TAC]."
"Another reason why I reject the interpretation of the Appellant is that the Courts in their"
"discretion will not normally make the remedy of judicial review available where there is"
"an  alternative  remedy  by  way  of  appeal  or  where  some  other  body  has  exclusive"
"jurisdiction  in  respect  of  the  dispute.  However,  judicial  review  may  be  granted  in"
"exceptional  circumstances  such  as  where  the alternative statutory  remedy  is  nowhere"
