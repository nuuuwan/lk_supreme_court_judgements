"If the TAC can examine matters other than the merits, then does the TAC have the power"
"to remit such other matter [i.e. a matter not relating to the substantive tax issue] to the"
"Commissioner General?  In my view, if the TAC has the power to examine matters other"
"than the merits, then the power of remission too should include the power to remit the"
"case on matters other than on merit. If it is assumed that the TAC does have the power to"
"examine  matters  other  than  the  substantive  tax  matter,  then  my  brotherâ€™s  analysis"
"explaining why the TAC should have the power to remit this matter to the Commissioner"
"General is persuasive. I would only add that if the matter is so remitted, it does not mean"
"that  the  Commissioner  General  has  unlimited  time  to  make  such  determination.  He"
"would need to do so within a reasonable time, which in the circumstances of the scheme"
"of the Act cannot exceed the time set out in Section 34(8) from the date of reference."
