"construction. To harmonise is not to destroy.”"
"The principles enunciated above can be summarized as follows;"
"1.  The Courts must avoid a head-on clash of seemingly contradicting provisions and"
"must construe the contradictory provisions so as to harmonize them."
"2.  The provision of one section cannot be used to defeat the provision contained in"
"another,  unless  the  Court,  despite  all 
its  effort,  is  unable  to  reconcile  their"
"differences."
"3.  When  it  is  impossible  to  completely  reconcile  the  differences  in  contradictory"
"provisions, the Courts must interpret them in a manner so that effect is given to"
"both the provisions as much as possible."
"4.  Courts must also keep in mind that interpretation that reduces one provision to an"
"inutility is contrary to a harmonious construction."
"Applying the principles above, the interpretation advanced by the Appellant is evidently"
"contrary to a harmonious interpretation, since that interpretation ignores Section 8(1)(a)"
"of  the  Act,  thereby  resulting  in  a  conflict  of  the  two  provisions,  as  Section  8(1)(a)"
"explicitly  provides  an  appellant  the  ability  to  canvass 
‘any matter’  relating  to  the"
"imposition of any tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty by the Commissioner – General before"
"the  TAC.  In  my  view  an  interpretation  stating  that  the  TAC’s  jurisdiction  is  limited  to"
"substantive tax matters results in an inconsistency between the provisions. A ‘matter’ is"
"“something to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defence”"
"(Black’s Law Dictionary 10th Edition). The use of the determinant word ‘any’ implies that"
"the scope of questions of law that can be heard by the TAC was not limited to substantive"
