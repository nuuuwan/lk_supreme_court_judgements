"felt  that  there  was  a  deficiency  in  the  hearing,  it  should  have  identified  the  relevant"
"aspects that had not been considered (if any) and then evaluated whether such failures"
"have resulted in a wrong decision. That would be consonant with its powers in appeal."
"T
here are two conflicting interpretations with regard to the scope of the power of the"
"TAC which have been highlighted by my brother.  The first is that the restriction on the"
"powers of the TAC in terms of Section 9(10) of the TAC Act be ignored and its powers be"
"defined with  reference to  Section  8(1)(a). In  other words,  the limitation  on  the  TAC’s"
"power implied in Section 9(10) which requires the Commissioner having to “revise the"
"assessment in order that it is in conformity with such amount as stated in the decision of"
"t
he Commission” should be expanded with reference to Section 8(1)(a) which refers to"
"the right to appeal to the TAC in respect of any matter relating to the imposition of any"
"t
ax, levy, charge, duty or penalty”.  My brother favours this interpretation."
"T
he second interpretation is to limit the scope of the reference in Section 8(1)(a) in line"
"with  Section  9(10).  This  was  the  position  articulated  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General. The said argument is one which has the support of several previous decisions."
"The Supreme Court in the 5 judge bench decision in D M S Fernando v Ismail [(1982) IV"
"SLTC 184], held as follows:"
"“
I
t
 
was contended by the Deputy Solicitor General that the Respondent was not entitled"
"t
o
 
maintain this application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was"
"available to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him to an appeal"
"against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not been given power to order"
"t
he Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or may not, do so as an administrative act."
"The Assessor may, or may not, obey. The Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution"
"o
f
 
such administrative acts. The present objection goes to the very root of the matter and"
"i
s
 
i
ndependent of quantum. It concerns the very exercise of power and is a fit matter for"
"Writ jurisdiction. An application for Writ of Certiorari is the proper remedy.” (Emphasis"
