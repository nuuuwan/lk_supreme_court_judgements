Judgement

Aluwihare, PC, J

The Petitioner Petitioner Appellant to this application (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) is the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. The Respondent Respondent

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) is a limited liability company

3

incorporated under the laws of Sri Lanka and has been engaged in the business of a Travel

Agent for airlines. The Respondent pursuant to Gazette Extraordinary No. 127/5 dated

17th December 2002 operated on the assumption that its service income was zero rated

for the purpose of Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed in terms of the Value Added Tax Act

No. 14 of 2002. Therefore, the Respondent did not pay any VAT on its service income.

The Respondent states that the above position was confirmed by a document issued by

M.G Somachandra, Deputy Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Department (ACT17/9)

dated 25.02.2008 (vide. P. 49 of the Brief). However, when the VAT returns were

submitted by the Respondent for certain taxable periods, on the basis that their supplies

were zero rated, the returns were rejected by the assessor stating that Commission

Income of the Respondent could not be considered as a zero-rated supply and new VAT

assessment had been issued in terms of Section 28 of the Value Added Tax Act of 2002.

The Respondent appealed against the said decision of the assessor to the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred to as Commissioner-General) against the

assessment. The Appeal was heard by Commissioner K. Dharmasena in the period of

December 2012 to March 2013 and the said Commissioner reserved the determination.

But the determination was issued by another Commissioner, namely D.M Somadasa

Dissanayake by way of letter dated 02.08.2013 (vide p. 31 of the Brief). Thereafter, the

reasons for the determination were issued on 05.08.2013, however, it was Commissioner

D.M Somadasa Dissanayake who had signed the said reasons for the determination, but

that document contained the name of Commissioner K. Dharmasena in its first page.

Therefore, the Commissioner-General sought to replace page 1 of the reasons for the

determination by letters dated 09.10.2013 and 14.10.2013. As per the reasons for the

determination issued by Commissioner D.M Somadasa Dissanayake, dated 05.08.2013

as amended on 09.10.2013 (P 1 vide p. 4 of the brief), a note was inscribed as follows;

The above appeals heard before K. Dharmasena (Commissioner (Zone III) and the dates

of hearing mentioned above are dates of hearing made by him. Further, the names

mentioned under the appearance are the persons appeared for the case.

I (Commissioner D.M Somadasa Dissanayake) have determined the above appeals upon

letter dated 04.07.2013(CGIR/APP/H/2013) Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

4

Hence, it is apparent that two separate Commissioners had heard and issued the

determination. Aggrieved by the aforesaid determination the Respondent appealed to Tax

Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the TAC). At the TAC the Respondent

raised a preliminary objection that there had been a violation of the principles of natural

justice. The Appellants response to the said preliminary objection was that the TAC has

no jurisdiction to entertain preliminary objections and has been constituted only to

consider the merits of the assessment. The TAC made its determination (P8) on

13.11.2014, whereby the TAC upheld that there was a violation of the principles of

natural justice and the assessment was accordingly annulled.

The Appellant, aggrieved by the said determination made by the TAC, stated a case to the

Court of Appeal on the following questions of law;

1. Whether the Tax Appeals Commission acted in excess of its limited jurisdiction as it

cannot assume jurisdiction it does not possess to decide on questions of law?

2. Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law to determine the appeal on

matters raised as preliminary objections by the Appellants counsel?

3.Whether the Tax Appeals Commission was empowered by the Hon. Minister of Finance

who appointed it to hear and determine appeals preferred by the Appellant to give its

determination without hearing the matters raised in the appeal?

4.Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law in determining a question of

law and failed to give due consideration to the judgement of the case A.M Ismail v CIR

(SLTC Vol. VI p. 156) that question of law have to be decided by courts and Tax Appeals

Commission can decide on questions of fact?

5.Whether the Tax Appeals Commission had erred in law, that coming into conclusion

that it is a violation of principles of natural justice where hearing of the appeal by one

commissioner and concluded hearing the other commissioner notice of determination

based on the record maintained by the first commissioner?

The Court of Appeal delivered its Judgement on 06.04.2017 in favour of the Respondent

dismissing the appeal (vide p. 85 of the Brief). The Appellant being aggrieved with the

5

Judgement of the Court of Appeal, sought special leave to appeal from this court and

Special Leave to Appeal was granted on the following questions of law;

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in law when holding that a Tax Appeal Commission could

dispose its mandate on preliminary objections?

2.Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in not analyzing that the preliminary issue raised

did not relate to the validity of the assessment made, which issue is in fact the dispute

that is sought to be resolved and regarding which the questions of fact and law should

have been considered by the Tax Appeals Commission?

3. Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the time bar provisions contained

in Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act would apply if the matter was sent back for

re-hearing to the Commissioner by the Tax Appeals Commission?

Before considering the questions of law, the Court observes that the Appellant had

submitted the final written submissions on 16.10.2023, despite arguments were heard

on 03.11.2021 and parties, if wished, were required to file written submission within

three weeks from the said date. Needless to say, the Rules of this Court are not mere

procedural niceties but ensure that no prejudice is caused to the litigants. Therefore, the

parties should adhere to the time limits provided by this Court. However, the Court

considered the written submissions although belatedly filed by the Appellant.

Question of Law 01: Can the Tax Appeal Commission Dispose its Mandate on Preliminary

Objections?

The Appellant argued that as per Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No.23

of 2011 (as amended) a final determination cannot be given, which results in the

assessment being annulled if the substantive tax issue is not considered by the TAC. On

this basis the Appellant argues that the TAC erroneously disposed of its mandate by way

of a preliminary objection. The contention simply stated was that the, the TAC is only

mandated to consider appeals, on merit.

Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act provides that;

6

After hearing the evidence, the Commission shall on appeal either confirm, reduce,

increase or annul, as the case may be, the assessment as determined by the

Commissioner- General or may remit the case to the Commissioner-General with the

decision of the Commission on such appeal. Where a case is so remitted by the

Commission, the Commissioner- General shall revise the assessment in order that it is in

conformity with such amount as stated in the decision of the Commission. [Emphasis

added]

I do not find merit in the contention of the Appellant referred to above, regarding the 1st

question of law. The advantage of a preliminary objection is to prevent unnecessary

litigation. Hence, the purpose of preliminary objections is not to stifle legitimate

adjudication but to dispose a matter expeditiously when it is apparent that the action

cannot be maintained. His Ladyship Justice Thilakawardena in Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya

vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another [2003] 3 Sri.L.R. 146 at 149 held that;

Preliminary objections are also particularly useful for actions which have no substance

and where it is clear that such action could not possibly succeed. The purpose of raising

preliminary objections is not to shut out or stifle legitimate adjudication. Preliminary

objections are particularly unhelpful and are without basis in the context where facts

and/or law is in dispute. It is also important to distinguish a preliminary objection from

an objection on any point of law, which can be raised at any part of the trial unlike the

preliminary objections, which by its nature is expected to be raised at the beginning of

the proceedings prior to the beginning of the arguments in the case.

The Appellant also argued that in any event the preliminary objection raised by the

Respondent does not go to the root of the issue, as the failure to abide by rules of natural

justice is merely a defect in the procedure adopted by the Commissioner General.

Further, it was argued that no prejudice is caused by the lack of oral hearing as the

documentary evidence including expert evidence was considered by the Commissioner-

General. Moreover, the Appellant argued that the TAC cannot refuse to exercise

jurisdiction on a tax matter in the guise of annulling the determination on a preliminary

objection when the TAC is the arbiter of questions of fact. This argument presupposes

that the jurisdiction of the TAC is limited to substantive matters of the assessment.

7

It is certainly true that one of the virtues of procedurally fair decision-making is that it is

liable to result in better decisions, by ensuring that the decision-maker receives all

relevant information and that it is properly tested but the purpose of a fair hearing is not

merely to improve the chances of the tribunal reaching the right decision. At least two

other important values are at stake as identified by Lord Reed in Booth v Parole Board

[2013] UKSC 61.

The first is the avoidance of the sense of injustice which the person who is the subject of

the decision will otherwise feel. Justice entails that a person whose rights are significantly

affected by a decision of an administrative or judicial body, should be allowed to

participate in the procedure by which the decision is made, provided they have

something to say which is relevant to the decision to be taken. This aspect of fairness

avoids resentment that will be aroused if a party to legal proceedings is placed in a

position where it is impossible for him or her to influence the result. As observed by Lord

Reed in Booth v Parole Board [supra] at [66];

I would prefer to consider first the reason for that sense of injustice, namely that justice

is intuitively understood to require a procedure which pays due respect to persons whose

rights are significantly affected by decisions taken in the exercise of administrative or

judicial functions. Respect entails that such persons ought to be able to participate in the

procedure by which the decision is made, provided they have something to say which is

relevant to the decision to be taken.

The second value is the rule of law. Procedural requirements that decision-makers should

listen to persons who have something relevant to say promote congruence between the

actions of decision-makers and the law which should govern their actions per Booth v

Parole Board [supra] at [71]. Hence, even if the documentary evidence was considered

by the Commissioner- General as argued by the Appellant, there is a breach of the

principles of natural justice.

In this backdrop it would be pertinent to consider the document marked and produced

by the Appellant as P3, the letter [dated 02.08.2013] by which the Department of Inland

Revenue communicated the determination of the Commissioner General, regarding the

Respondents appeal to the Commissioner General which had been signed by

8

Commissioner D.M.S Dissanayake. In communicating the decision, the writer states that

having considered the written and oral submissions made by authorized

representatives and a few officials on behalf of the appellant company and the views,

explanations ruling submissions made by the Department officials on behalf of the

revenue, I determine the above appeal by confirming the assessment

The Determination, however, gives three dates of hearing, namely 13.12.2012,

21.01.2013 and 07.03.2013 and the notation added by Commissioner DMS Dissanayake

states that The above appeals heard before K. Dharmadasa (Commissioner Zon III) and

the dates of hearing mentioned above are dates of hearing made by him.

The above, clearly demonstrates that no hearings had taken place before Commissioner

D.M.S Dissanayake and for him to say that he considered oral submissions made by

authorized representatives and a few officials on behalf of the appellant company. is

patently incorrect and demands inquiry, not only from the perspective whether the

Respondent was accorded a fair hearing but also whether the submissions made on behalf

of them received due consideration. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that no prejudice is

allegedly caused to the Respondent as submitted by the Appellant.

Further, if the Respondent was not provided with a fair hearing, then the assessment

made by the Commissioner-General is defective and the fact that the assessment was

made by another assessor is quite apparent. Then the TAC is not required to further

consider the defective assessment of the Commissioner General, since the objection of

the Respondent goes to the root of the cause.

The Court of Appeal held in this regard at p. 18 that;

If a question of law or fact or a question mixed with both law and fact is raised as a

preliminary issue which goes to the root of the case, determining that issue first, would

undoubtedly save time and resources of all stakeholders. Besides this, it is an accepted

norm that a party agitating a question of fact or law must first have it raised before the

original institution tasked to resolve that dispute. This is underpinned by the fact that

such original institution may well uphold such argument saving time and resources of

the appellate forum. Thus, there is also no merit in the statement that the Tax Appeals

9

Commission has erred in law when it determined the appeal on the matters raised as

preliminary objections by the learned counsel for the Appellant.

Whilst agreeing with the views expressed above, I am of the opinion that the legislature

never intended to oust and limit the jurisdiction of the TAC to the substantive matters of

the assessment. If the legislature intended to limit the jurisdiction of the TAC to

substantive matters of the assessment, then such intention would be expressly provided.

The only requirement of Section 9(10) is for the TAC to hear the evidence in appeal and

either confirm, reduce, increase or annual the assessment determined by the

Commissioner General or remit the case to the Commissioner-General with the decision

of the TAC. It is a recognized rule of interpretation that the duty of the Court is to construe

Acts of Parliament according to the intent or will of the legislature and to give the words

their meaning, even if that intention appears to the Court just or unjust or inconvenient

or whatever may be the ulterior consequences of so interpreting them, as dislike of the

effect of a statute is of no consequence.

I am also persuaded by the reasoning of His Lordship Justice Ruwan Fernando in the case

of The Commissioner of General of Inland Revenue v. Cargills Food Service (Pvt) Ltd Case

No. CA/TAX/0013/2016 (C.A. Minutes 25.05.2023) at p. 37 regarding the

interpretation of Section 11A of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. His Lordship stated

that;

At this stage, it is relevant to note that the right of appeal by way of a case stated is a

substantive right given to any person aggrieved by the decision of the TAC in terms of

section 11A(1) of the TAC Act. When that right has already vested with the parties on

the date the lis (proceedings) commenced in the TAC, that right cannot be denied to such

party who seeks remedies to violated rights, unless that right has been taken away by a

subsequent enactment, if it so provided expressly and not otherwise

Further at p. 39 the Court held that;

This vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment, if it so

provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise

10

In my opinion if the interpretation advanced by the Appellant is accepted, the Court will

inadvertently usurp legislative functions by limiting the scope of the appeal, when an

express limitation is not provided by the Legislature. I find support for this view in terms

of Section 8(1)(a) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act which provides that;

8(1) Any person aggrieved by the determination of-

(a) the Commissioner-General, in respect of any matter relating to the imposition of any

tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty; or

(b) the Director-General under subsection (1B) of section 10 of the Customs Ordinance

(Chapter 235),

may if he is dissatisfied with the reasons stated by the Commissioner-General or the

Director- General, as the case may be, prefer the appeal therefrom to the Commission

within thirty days from the date of receipt of such reasons; or

If the Legislature intended the jurisdiction of the TAC to be limited to only review of the

substantive matter of the assessment, why would the Legislature in Section 8(1)(a) allow

an appeal to the TAC in respect of any matter relating to the imposition of any tax, levy

charge, duty, or penalty of the Commissioner - General? The rational conclusion that

could be drawn is that the Legislature never intended to limit the jurisdiction of the TAC

only to substantive issues.

It is a settled principle that a statute must be interpreted harmoniously. When two

interpretations are available, the Court interprets the provision harmoniously so as to

ensure the consistent operation of the Act. An interpretation that results in a clash of

provision or reduces a provision to an inutility should be avoided. As held by Pasayat J,

in Commissioner of Income Tax Vs Hindustan Bulk Carriers, (2003) 3 SCC 57, P. 74

The Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not

merely to the clauses to be construed but to the entire statute; it must compare clause

with other parts of the law and the setting in which the clause to be interpreted occurs.

[See R.S. Raghunath v. State of Karnataka and Anr. (AIR 1992 SC 81)]. Such a

construction has the merit of avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a

section or between two different sections or provisions of the same statute. It is the duty

11

of the Court to avoid a head on clash between two sections of the same Act. [See Sultana

Begum v. Prem Chand Jain (AIR 1997 SC 1006)] Whenever it is possible to do so, it must

be done to construe the provisions which appear to conflict so that they harmonise. It

should not be lightly assumed that Parliament had given with one hand what it took away

with the other.

The provisions of one section of the statute cannot be used to defeat those of another

unless it is impossible to effect reconciliation between them. Thus a construction that

reduces one of the provisions to a useless lumber or dead letter is not a harmonised

construction. To harmonise is not to destroy.

The principles enunciated above can be summarized as follows;

1. The Courts must avoid a head-on clash of seemingly contradicting provisions and

must construe the contradictory provisions so as to harmonize them.

2. The provision of one section cannot be used to defeat the provision contained in

another, unless the Court, despite all its effort, is unable to reconcile their

differences.

3. When it is impossible to completely reconcile the differences in contradictory

provisions, the Courts must interpret them in a manner so that effect is given to

both the provisions as much as possible.

4. Courts must also keep in mind that interpretation that reduces one provision to an

inutility is contrary to a harmonious construction.

Applying the principles above, the interpretation advanced by the Appellant is evidently

contrary to a harmonious interpretation, since that interpretation ignores Section 8(1)(a)

of the Act, thereby resulting in a conflict of the two provisions, as Section 8(1)(a)

explicitly provides an appellant the ability to canvass any matter relating to the

imposition of any tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty by the Commissioner General before

the TAC. In my view an interpretation stating that the TACs jurisdiction is limited to

substantive tax matters results in an inconsistency between the provisions. A matter is

something to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defence

(Blacks Law Dictionary 10th Edition). The use of the determinant word any implies that

the scope of questions of law that can be heard by the TAC was not limited to substantive

12

tax questions but is wide, subject to the jurisdictional requirements of the Act. Therefore,

an interpretation that does not limit the TACs jurisdiction to the substantive tax

assessment is preferred as that construction avoids any clash between the provisions. In

those circumstances, I see no merit in the Appellants contention.

Question of Law 02: Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in not analyzing that the

preliminary issue raised did not relate to the validity of the assessment made, which issue

is in fact the dispute that is sought to be resolved and regarding which the questions of

fact and law should have been considered by the Tax Appeals Commission?

The Appellant contends that as per Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act the

word confirm and annul has to be in connection with the power to increase or reduce

the assessment of the Commissioner-General. On that basis the Appellant argued that the

decision of the TAC declaring the assessment of the Commissioner General as void, was

erroneous. This Court finds it difficult to appreciate the said contention of the Appellant.

The word annul is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary [11th Edition] as the act of

nullifying or making void. It is therefore apparent that the TAC had the power to declare

the decision of the Commissioner-General as void.

The Appellant also sought to argue that the proper remedy for the Respondent was to

challenge the assessment of the Commissioner General by way of a writ as the forum

of the TAC is exclusive to determining the validity of the assessment. The Appellant relied

on A.M Ismail v Commissioner of Inland Revenue SLTC Vol. IV at p. 156 as authority for

the proposition that the Respondent should have sought review from the determination

of the Commissioner-General by way of a writ and that a statutory appeal does not lie to

annual the determination. In A.M Ismail v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [Supra] it

was held that;

An appeal from a determination of a Commissioner to the Board of Review is also very

narrow in its scope. Further the Board of Review does not exercise judicial functions, but

is merely an instrument created for the administration of the Revenue Law and its work

is really administrative though judicial authorities are called for in the performance of

its duties. It is a body created as an administrative check to see that a tax payers liability

is correctly ascertained. The fact that it could state a case in regard to a question of law

13

to the Supreme Court to determine the liability in regard to taxes does not give a Board

of Review the authority to declare notices sent by, or proceedings before an Assessor void

or to quash them. It has power to review or annul an assessment if it is proved that an

assessee was not liable to pay the tax charged.

His Lordship Justice Abdul Cader made these observations in relation to the question

whether it was mandatory to communicate to the taxpayer the reasons for rejecting a

return on income tax under the Inland Revenue Act of 1968 (as amended). The instant

appeal relates to the assessment made by the Commissioner-General and its validity. The

facts can be distinguished since Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act

expressly provides the power on the TAC to annul an assessment. Further, the Court also

expressly recognized in A.M Ismail v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [supra] that the

Board of Review has the power to review or annul an assessment if it is proved that an

assessee was not liable to pay the tax charged. A taxpayer is entitled to a fair hearing to

ensure that a proper assessment is recorded upon considering all relevant matters and

the applicable provisions . If a taxpayer is not provided with a fair hearing, then the

assessment is defective. Therefore, the TAC was correct in annulling the determination of

the Commissioner-General and on that basis also, there is no conflict with the decision

of A.M Ismail v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [supra].

It is also relevant that writ remedies are not granted by the Court as of right but are

discretionary. The granting of a writ remedy depends on various other circumstances,

such as laches, or misconduct, misrepresentation or non- disclosure of facts and

acquiescence, unlike a right of appeal under Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act.

A similar argument was canvassed before the Court of Appeal in relation to Section

11A(6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act in The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, v Janashakthi General Insurance Col. Ltd Case No. CA (TAX) 14/2013 (C.A

Minutes 20.05.2020) and His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva rejected this argument and

held that (at p. 08);

Let me start the analysis by restating two established principles. Firstly, judicial review

being a discretionary remedy may be refused where there is an adequate and effective

14

remedy such as a statutory appeal. Secondly, judicial review is concerned with the

legality of a decision whereas an appeal inquires whether the decision is right or wrong.

There may be situations where an Appellant in a statutory appeal proceeding wishes to

raise questions relating to legality such as the breach of the rules of natural justice or an

issue on the jurisdiction of the decision maker. A multitude of judicial authority supports

the proposition that jurisdictional questions can be raised by way of appeal..

Breach of the common law principles of natural justice can be dealt with by the appellate

system in the tax field [R. v. Brentford General Commissioners Ex. p. Chan (1986) S.T.C.

65; R. v. Commissioner for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts Ex. p. Napier

(1988) 3 All E.R. 166; Banin v. Mackinlay (Inspector of Taxes) (1985) 1 All E.R. 842].

His Lordship Justice Ruwan Fernando also held in The Commissioner of General of Inland

Revenue v. Cargills Food Service (Pvt) Ltd [supra] at p. 57 in relation to Section 11A of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act that;

It is relevant to note that a party has no absolute right in a judicial remedy where an

inferior tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction, and where the absence or excess of jurisdiction

is not apparent on the face of the proceedings. It is only discretionary, and depends on

various other circumstances, such as laches, or misconduct, misrepresentation or non-

disclosure of facts and acquiescence etc. The grant of a writ is always discretionary and

is never demandable of right like in a case stated in terms of section 11A(1)

I am in agreement with the views expressed above and, in my opinion, they apply with

equal force to Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission. If the Respondent is required

to resort to judicial review to challenge a decision of the Commissioner-General, then

such an interpretation would cause undue hardship and burden to the taxpayer, when

an explicit right of appeal is provided[to the TAC].

Another reason why I reject the interpretation of the Appellant is that the Courts in their

discretion will not normally make the remedy of judicial review available where there is

an alternative remedy by way of appeal or where some other body has exclusive

jurisdiction in respect of the dispute. However, judicial review may be granted in

exceptional circumstances such as where the alternative statutory remedy is nowhere

15

near so convenient, beneficial and effectual or where there is no other equally effective

and convenient remedy. This is particularly so where the decision in question is liable to

be upset as a matter of law because it is clearly made without jurisdiction or in

consequence of an error of law. This principle is discussed in Judicial Remedies in Public

Law, Sir Clive Lewis, 5th edtn. at p. 75;

Judicial review is, in principle, available in relation to the acts and omissions of inferior

courts such as the county court or magistrates' courts. In practice, the availability of

judicial review is likely to be limited by the availability of other methods of challenge

such as appeals. Judicial review will not normally be permitted if there are adequate

alternative remedies available. There are rights of appeal against decisions of district

judges and county courts, for example. Where the possibility of an appeal to a higher

court exists, that route is the appropriate method of challenging the original decision

rather than a claim for judicial review unless there are exceptional circumstances

justifying bring a claim for judicial review.

Of course, the crux of the argument advanced by the Appellant was that judicial review

is the only remedy in the instant appeal, and that the Respondent ought to have moved

to have the assessment of the Commissioner General quashed, by way of a writ,

however, I am of the view that the interpretation advanced by the Appellant would

deprive a party the most convenient, effectual and beneficial remedy.

In R v Brentford General Commissioners, ex parte Chan and others [1986] STC 65 the

taxpayers applied for an order to quash the decision of the General Commissioners of

Income Tax for denial of natural justice. The court held that Section 56(6) of the Taxes

Management Act 1970 of United Kingdom, gave the court the widest possible powers to

remit cases to the commissioners for amendment or rehearing, including the power to

deal with procedural irregularities and that judicial review would not be an appropriate

remedy in a tax case unless there were exceptional circumstances. In determining

whether judicial review was the appropriate remedy, the court by citing Ex p Waldron

[1985] 3 WLR 1090 at p. 1108 mentioned certain guidelines as follows;

Whether the alternative statutory remedy will resolve questions at issue fully and

directly; whether the statutory procedure would be quicker or slower than procedure by

16

way of judicial review; whether the matter depends on some particular or technical

knowledge which is more readily available to the alternative appellate body, these are

amongst the matters which a court should take into account when deciding whether to

grant relief by judicial review where an alternative remedy is available

Certainly, these guidelines are not exhaustive in determining whether judicial review is

the appropriate remedy but applying them to the present case, in my opinion an appeal

to the TAC can resolve an issue fully but judicial review may not, as the focus on the latter

is the legality of the issue. Moreover, the members of the TAC would be more aware,

perhaps, of the practice and the exigencies relating to fiscal law and practice, therefore

can resolve the issues fully. On that basis judicial review would not be the proper remedy

in this instance. I am also persuaded by the dicta of Lord Templeman in Preston v IRC

[1985] AC 835 at p. 362

Judicial review should not be granted where an alternative remedy is available. In most

cases in which the commissioners are said to have fallen into error, the remedy of the

taxpayer lies in the appeal procedures provided by the tax statutes to the General

Commissioners or Special Commissioners. This appeal structure provides an independent

and informed tribunal which meets in private so that the taxpayer is not embarrassed in

disclosing his affairs and the commissioners are not inhibited by their duty of

confidentiality. The commissioners and the tribunals established to hear appeals from the

commissioners have wide knowledge and experience of fiscal law and practice. Appeals

from the General Commissioners or the Special Commissioners lie, but only on questions

of law, to the High Court by means of a case stated and the High Court can then correct

all kinds of errors of law including errors which might otherwise be the subject of judicial

review proceedings

As judicial review is a collateral challenge and not an appeal, it will only be in exceptional

circumstances that the courts will allow the collateral process of judicial review to be

used to attack an appealable decision, when Parliament has expressly provided by statute

an appellate procedure. But exceptional circumstances may arise when it would be

unjust for the taxpayer to appeal a decision of the Commissioner General. For example,

if the Commissioner General during the hearing acted illegally or ultra vires, then

17

exceptional circumstances may arise where judicial review is appropriate to challenge

the alleged abuse at its inception. Otherwise, the taxpayer would be expected to proceed

with the allegedly illegal hearing until the determination is issued by the Commissioner-

General to appeal the Commissioner-Generals assessment to the TAC.

Accordingly, in my opinion judicial review is not the proper remedy unless exceptional

circumstances justify a claim for judicial review. If judicial review is eliminated as a

remedy unless exceptional circumstances justify a claim, then the proper remedy would

be an appeal to the TAC, therefore, I find no merit in the contention of the Appellant.

Question of Law 03: Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the time bar

provisions contained in Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act would apply if the matter

was sent back for re-hearing to the Commissioner by the Tax Appeals Commission?

The Appellant argued that the Court of Appeal erred by holding that TAC and the

Commissioner-General are time barred from hearing a fresh appeal of the instant case

by virtue of Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act. The gravamen of the Appellants

argument is that the Court of Appeal has the power to remit a case to the TAC for

rehearing with any guidelines set by the Court as per Section11A(6) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act. It was also argued that the Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act only

imposes a time bar on the Commissioner - General in hearing a matter when an appeal

is made from the assessment [of an assessor or an assistant commissioner] and has no

application to the Court of Appeal since a case remitted will be a fresh inquiry. It was

argued by the Appellant that a contrary interpretation would deprive much needed

revenue to the State since an assessment would be annulled, and time barred for

extraneous issues unrelated to the substantive tax assessment. The same argument was

canvassed by the Appellant at the Court of Appeal, and the Court held [at p. 13] that;

The Commissioner General in this instance has failed to accomplish any lawful hearing

of the appeal up to now. Thus, he has failed to comply with the time frame prescribed in

the above section. The invalidation of his previous determination amounts, in the eyes of

law, to the said appeal being not heard.

18

Therefore, it is clear when this Court holds that the determination by the Commissioner

General is not valid, what remains valid is the determination by the Assessor. [Emphasis

added]

Section 34 of the VAT Act has specified in no uncertain terms, the effect of such appeal

is not agreed or determined within the specified period. Thus, in such a situation the

appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed.

The above position appears to be in line with the fact that neither section 9(10) nor 11 A

(6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act provide that a case could be sent back for 're-

inquiry'.

It was further held by the Court that;

It is to be observed that both the aforementioned sections, [Sections 9(10) and 11A(6)

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act] the action to be taken either by the Commission or

by the Commissioner-General when a case is so remitted have been restricted to the

revision of the assessment in order that it is in conformity with such amount as stated in

the said decision. It is to be observed that these sections do not provide for the conduct of

re-inquiries as has been provided for in the case of regular appeal proceedings. This

could be to avoid any conflict with the operation of the time bar placed on the

Commissioner-General regarding the disposal of appeals made to him

Sections 9(10) and 11A (6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act provides as follows;

Section9(10); After hearing the evidence, the Commission shall on appeal either

confirm, reduce, increase or annul, as the case may be, the assessment as determined by

the Commissioner- General or may remit the case to the Commissioner-General with the

decision of the Commission on such appeal. Where a case is so remitted by the

Commission, the Commissioner- General shall revise the assessment in order that it is in

conformity with such amount as stated in the decision of the Commission

Section 11A(6); Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and determine

any question of law arising on the stated case and may in accordance with the decision

of Court upon such question, confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment

determined by the Commission, or may remit the case to the Commission with the

19

opinion of the Court, thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission

shall revise the assessment in accordance with the opinion of the Court

The interpretation given to Section 11A(6) by His Lordship Justice Samarakoon in the

case of Cargills Agrifood Ltd v The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue C.A Tax

36/2014 (C.A Minutes 28.02.2023) merits consideration. The Court held that;

Hence, any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may,

(i) determine any question of law arising on the stated case,

It does not say may determine the determination of the Commission.

(ii) confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the Commission,

(iii) or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court, thereon.

This may or may not be on the determination of the Commission, because the term

thereon refers to any question of law arising on the stated case.

What does the next sentence mean?

Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission shall revise the assessment in

accordance with the opinion of the Court.

If the question of law arose was not with regard to the assessment determined by the

Commission, how shall the Commission revise the assessment?

The answer is, that, the assessment, referred to in the last sentence is, the assessment

made by the assessor.

This is why, the previous sentence refers to the assessment determined by the

Commission but the last sentence just say assessment.

The legislature will not waste words as well as it will not use words without a meaning.

Hence it is clear that,

(a) there can be a case stated on a question of law other than the determination of the

Commission on tax,

20

(b) the Court has power to remit the case to the Commission, with its opinion on the

question of law so arose and

(c) the Commission shall, on receiving such an opinion of the Court, revise the

assessment of the assessor.

I am in agreement with the above views expressed by His Lordship Justice Samarakoon.

In my opinion similar to above, Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act

provides that;

The Commission shall on appeal;

1. either confirm, reduce, increase or annul, as the case may be, the assessment as

determined by the Commissioner- General or;

2. remit the case to the Commissioner-General with the decision of the Commission

on such appeal.

3. When a case is remitted by the Commission, the Commissioner-General is

required to revise the assessment in order that it is in conformity with such amount

as stated in the decision of the Commission.

On that basis the TAC can dispose of its mandate by a preliminary issue and remit the

case to the Commissioner General. The Commissioner General thereafter, is required

to revise the assessment of the assessor. But how can the Commissioner General revise

the assessment in conformity with such amount as stated in the decision of the

Commission if the TAC disposes of its mandate by way of a preliminary objection without

considering the substantive tax issues?

The first possible interpretation that can reconcile the above position is the one adopted

by the Court of Appeal. According to this interpretation, when the Commissioner-

General's assessment is invalidated by the TAC, what remains is the assessment made by

the assessor. The TAC cannot remit the case for a fresh inquiry, possibly due to the time-

bar set forth in Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act. However, I unable to agree with

this interpretation for two reasons

First, if a taxpayer appeals the assessor's assessment to the Commissioner-General, and

the Commissioner-General's assessment is later annulled due to reasons such as a breach

21

of natural justice or by way of any other preliminary objections, the taxpayer is left with

what he believes to be an erroneous assessment of the assessor. In my opinion, this

interpretation defeats the purpose of the appeal process. The second reason, as advanced

by the Appellant, is that the correct tax liability of a taxpayer will be unascertained for

extraneous reasons unrelated to the substantive tax issue, and I am in agreement with

this view.

The second possible interpretation is to construe Section 9(10) narrowly as advanced by

the Appellant, by limiting the jurisdiction of the TAC and holding that the TAC can only

determine issues related to the substantive tax issues. This interpretation would limit the

TACs jurisdiction to an arithmetic revision and for the reasons explained above cannot

be accepted, as the remedy for a taxpayer then would be limited to judicial review and is

contrary to a harmonious interpretation of the Tax Appeals Act.

Of course, it can be argued that although the TAC correctly annulled the determination

of the Commissioner General, the TAC should have considered the substantive tax issue.

Even the Appellant advanced a similar view in the alternative and stated that the TAC

should have provided a decision separately on the preliminary question of law and the

substantive matters. This view was also expressed in The Commissioner of General of

Inland Revenue v. Cargills Food Service (Pvt) Ltd [supra] at p. 60 which was also

concerned with remitting a case, albeit from the Court of Appeal to the TAC, when the

TAC annulled the assessment of the Commissioner General, by upholding a preliminary

objection. By virtue of Section 9(10), it appears to me, that the jurisdiction of the TAC is

limited to the revision of the assessment of the Commissioner General, therefore, once

the assessment of the Commissioner General is annulled the TAC cannot reassess the

assessors assessment or in other words consider the substantive tax assessment, thereby

exceeding its jurisdiction.

I am of the opinion that Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act provides two

courses of action;

1. on appeal either confirm, reduce, increase or annul, as the case may be, the

assessment as determined by the Commissioner- General (first limb); or

22

2. remit the case to the Commissioner-General with the decision of the Commission

on such appeal (second limb)

It appears that the first limb may generally apply when determining the substantive

matters of the assessment of the Commissioner General, whereby the TAC can either

confirm, annul, reduce or increase the assessment. In my view, the second limb includes

the four powers provided under the first limb (i.e the power of the TAC to confirm,

reduce, increase, or annul the assessment of the Commissioner-General) and the power

to direct the Commissioner-General to revise the assessment in accordance with the

decision of the TAC. To put this in another way, the second limb apply;

(i) If the TAC is of the view that the amount of the assessment determined by the

Commissioner- General must be either increased or reduced, the case may be remitted

back to the Commissioner-General. The Commissioner - General is required to revise the

assessment in accordance with such amount as stated in the decision of the TAC;

(ii) If the TAC annulled the assessment made by the Commissioner- General on questions

other than substantive matters of the assessment, the case may be remitted back to the

Commissioner-Geneal with its decision. The decision can include any guidelines or

directions for the Commissioner-General to follow in revising the substantive matters of

the assessors assessment. Thereafter, the Commissioner-General is required, if so

directed, to revise the assessors assessment in accordance with such decision of the TAC.

In such instances, the TAC is not required to provide an amount in its decision.

I support the above view, (in para (ii) above) with two propositions. First, the following

view is apparent as per the Sinhala text of Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act, which provides as follows;

23

The second proposition is that it is a commonly accepted rule in the construction of a

statute to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words used and to the grammatical

construction of a statute. However, if the literal construction is at variance with the

intention of the legislature, to be collected from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest

absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may be varied or modified so as to

avoid such inconvenience but no further. The following view is stated by N.S Bindra,

Interpretation of Statutes [9th Edition] at p. 439, citing Rex v Vasey [1905] 2 KB 748, as

follows;

Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction,

leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some

inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice presumably, not intended, a

construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words, and the

structure of the sentence

However, such an inference should not be made lightly. Bindra on the Interpretation of

Statutes at p. 439 [supra] states as follows;

In interpreting a statute, an intention contrary to the literal meaning of words of the

statute should not be inferred unless the context or consequences which would ensure

from a literal interpretation, justify the inference that the legislature has not expressed

something which it intended to express, or unless such interpretation leads to any

manifest absurdity or repugnance with this superadded qualification that the absurdity

24

or repugnance must be such as manifested itself in the mind of the law-maker, and not

such as may appear to be so to the Tribunal interpreting the statute.

Bindra on the Interpretation of Statutes at p. 440 [supra] states further citing North v

Templin 8 QBD 247 that;

Anyone who contends that a section of an Act of Parliament is not to be read literally

must be able to show one of the two things, either that there is some other section which

cuts down its meaning, or else that the section itself is repugnant to the general purview

of the Act

In my opinion, the departure from the literal construction of Section 9(10) is justified in

this instance as Section 8(1)(a) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not limit the

jurisdiction of the TAC to substantive matters of the assessment for the reasons stated

above. Further, if the Court of Appeals interpretation is accepted then that interpretation

would defeat the purpose of the appeal procedure and result in manifest absurdity. If a

taxpayer appeals against the assessor's assessment to the Commissioner-General, and the

TAC annuls the Commissioner-General's assessment through no fault of the taxpayer,

leaving the taxpayer with the same assessor's assessment taxpayer initially contested, to

say the least would be an absurd outcome.

Further, it appears that the intention of the legislature by establishing the TAC was to

resolve tax disputes expeditiously, effectively, and efficiently by the establishment of an

informed tribunal. This view is supported by the fact that Section 2(2) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act recognizes that the members appointed to the TAC comprise of persons

that gained eminence in the field of taxation, finance and law. Therefore, an

interpretation in furtherance of this object should be preferred. None of the

interpretations provided by the Appellant advances this objective. The Appellants

interpretation unduly restricts the scope of the TAC. Hence, I am of the opinion that it is

justified for the Court to depart from the literal construction of the section as stated above,

which advances the object of the Act. In consideration of the interpretation above, it

appears that the first error of the TAC and the Court of Appeal is the holding that the case

cannot be remitted, when the provision provides otherwise. Both the TAC and the Court

25

of Appeal also fell into error in justifying the first error by resorting to Section 34 of the

Value Added Tax Act.

Section 34(8) of the Value Added Tax Act provides that;

Every appellant shall attend before the Commissioner-General at time and place fixed

for the hearing of the appeal.

Provided further that every petition of appeal under this Chapter shall be agreed to or

determined by the Commissioner General within two years from the date on which such

petition of appeal is received by the Commissioner-General unless the agreement or

determination of such appeal depends on the furnishing of any document or the taking

of any action by any person other than the appellant or the Commissioner General or an

Assessor or Assistant Commissioner where such appeal is not agreed to or determined

within such period the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed and the tax charged

accordingly

Section 34(1) relates to appeals from the assessor or assistant commissioner to the

Commissioner General in regard to any assessment of penalty. Therefore, the time bar

in Section 34(8) relates to the appeal from the assessor or assistant commissioner. If the

time bar is not complied with, then the appeal is deemed to be allowed. In my view once

the TAC remits a case to the Commissioner General then it is heard as a fresh inquiry

and the time bar in Section 34(8) of the Value Added Tax Act has no application.

Once a case is remitted from the TAC it is not an appeal from the assessor or assistant

commissioner but a fresh hearing. Blacks Law Dictionary 10th ed., defines remit as to

refer (a matter for decision) to some authority, esp. to send back (a case) to a lower

court. Accordingly, once the TAC remits a case to the Commissioner General, it is a

fresh hearing on this basis, and I am of the view that Section 34(8) of the Value Added

Tax Act will not be a fetter for the Commissioner General to revisit the Appeal made to

him by the Respondent.

26

Conclusion

In these circumstances, I answer the Questions of Law arising in the instant Appeal as

follows:

1.Did the Court of Appeal err in law when holding that a Tax Appeal Commission could

dispose its mandate on preliminary objections?

No. 2.Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in not analyzing that the preliminary issue raised

did not relate to the validity of the assessment made, which issue is in fact the dispute

that is sought to be resolved and regarding which the questions of fact and law should

have been considered by the Tax Appeals Commission?

No.

3. Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the time bar provisions contained

in Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act would apply if the matter was sent back for re-

hearing to the Commissioner by the Tax Appeals Commission?

Yes.

In view of the answer given in question of law No. 3 the appeal is partially allowed and

the Commissioner General is directed to re-hear the case.

Parties may bear the cost of this appeal.

Appeal is partially allowed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C, J,

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

27

Obeyesekere, J

I have read in draft the judgment of my brother Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, PC and

while his approach does appear to cut the Gordian Knot in the administration of tax law,

I am unable to fully agree with it as it appears that we may be encroaching upon the

legislative sphere.

The issue in this case relates to the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC)

to annul an assessment issued under the Value Added Services Act No. 14 of 2002, as

amended, which determination was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The TAC annulled

the assessment on the basis that while one Commissioner had heard the appeal to the

Commissioner General, another had issued the determination.

Leave to appeal was granted on the following three questions of law.

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in law when holding that a Tax Appeal Commission

could dispose its mandate on preliminary objections?

2. Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in not analyzing that the preliminary issue

raised did not relate to the validity of the assessment made, which issue is in fact the

dispute that is sought to be resolved and regarding which the questions of fact and

law should have been considered by the Tax Appeals Commission?

3. Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the time bar provisions

contained in Section 34 of the Value Added Tax Act would apply if the matter was

sent back for re-hearing to the Commissioner by the Tax Appeals Commission?

At the outset, I am constrained to note that the reference to a preliminary objection is

not appropriate, since the so called objection was raised by the party who filed the appeal

to the TAC. In essence, what was being sought was a summary determination of the issue.

28

In my respectful view this case ought to be approached from a different perspective. Tax

administration has been plagued with unnecessary delays. In as much as State revenue

remains uncollected for several years, taxpayers too have the burden of uncertainty with

regard to their liability. It is noted that more than 10 years have lapsed since the decision

of the Commissioner on behalf of the Commissioner General. It is not reasonable by the

Respondent or the Revenue for the entire matter to be referred back to the Commissioner

General at this stage. The TAC is an appellate body. If there are matters that have been

urged by the Respondent at the oral hearing that have not been considered by the

Commissioner in preparing his report, then those deficiencies can easily be supplied by

the TAC. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind the scheme of the TAC Act. Sections

9(7), (8) and (9) are of particular importance, and are re-produced below:

(7) The Commission shall have power to summon to a hearing, the attendance of any

person whom it considers capable of giving evidence respecting the appeal and may

examine him as a witness, either on oath or otherwise. Any person so attending may be

allowed by the Commission to be paid any reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by

him in so attending.

(8) Except with the consent of the Commission and on such terms as the Commission

may determine, the appellant shall not at the hearing, be allowed to produce any

document which was not produced before the Commissioner-General, or to adduce the

evidence of any witness whose evidence was not led before the Commissioner-General,

or adduce evidence of a witness whose evidence has already been recorded at the hearing

before the Commissioner-General.

(9) At the hearing of the appeal the Commission may, admit or reject any evidence

adduced whether oral or documentary, and the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance

relating to the admissibility of evidence shall not apply in respect of such evidence.

These provisions demonstrate the ample powers vested in the Commission to supplement

any hearing deficiencies in the appeal before the Commissioner General. If the TAC had

29

felt that there was a deficiency in the hearing, it should have identified the relevant

aspects that had not been considered (if any) and then evaluated whether such failures

have resulted in a wrong decision. That would be consonant with its powers in appeal.

There are two conflicting interpretations with regard to the scope of the power of the

TAC which have been highlighted by my brother. The first is that the restriction on the

powers of the TAC in terms of Section 9(10) of the TAC Act be ignored and its powers be

defined with reference to Section 8(1)(a). In other words, the limitation on the TACs

power implied in Section 9(10) which requires the Commissioner having to revise the

assessment in order that it is in conformity with such amount as stated in the decision of

the Commission should be expanded with reference to Section 8(1)(a) which refers to

the right to appeal to the TAC in respect of any matter relating to the imposition of any

tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty. My brother favours this interpretation.

The second interpretation is to limit the scope of the reference in Section 8(1)(a) in line

with Section 9(10). This was the position articulated by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General. The said argument is one which has the support of several previous decisions.

The Supreme Court in the 5 judge bench decision in D M S Fernando v Ismail [(1982) IV

SLTC 184], held as follows:

It was contended by the Deputy Solicitor General that the Respondent was not entitled

to maintain this application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was

available to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him to an appeal

against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not been given power to order

the Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or may not, do so as an administrative act.

The Assessor may, or may not, obey. The Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution

of such administrative acts. The present objection goes to the very root of the matter and

is independent of quantum. It concerns the very exercise of power and is a fit matter for

Writ jurisdiction. An application for Writ of Certiorari is the proper remedy. (Emphasis

added)

30

The Court of Appeal decision in the above case is also illuminating. Victor Perera, J held

as follows:

The petitioner cannot canvass the validity or legality of these acts of the Assessor by way

of an appeal to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The scope of an appeal to the

Commissioner has been clearly laid down in the sections dealing with appeals. An appeal

from a determination of a Commissioner to the Board of Review is also very narrow in its

scope. Further the Board of Review does not exercise judicial functions, but is merely an

instrument created for the administration of the Revenue Law and its work is really

administrative though judicial attributes are called for in the performance of its duties.

It is a body created as an administrative check to see that a tax payer's liability is correctly

ascertained. The fact that it could state a case in regard to a question of law to the

Supreme Court to determine the liability in regard to taxes does not give a Board of

Review the authority to declare notices sent by, or proceedings before an Assessor void

or to quash them. It has power to review or annul an assessment if it is proved that an

assessee was not liable to pay the tax charged. The power to quash a notice or proceeding

before an Assessor is vested in the courts and therefore this Court must be satisfied that

the circumstances justify the exercise of such a jurisdiction.

In Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v First Media Solutions (Pvt) Ltd

(CA/TAX/6/2016; CA minutes of 5th December 2019), Samayawardene, J in the Court

of Appeal observed as follows;

The very argument of the respondent tax payer is counterproductive. It opens the door

for a constructive dialogue about whether the Tax Appeals Commission has the authority

to declare Notices sent by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue void purely on

technical grounds, or whether it can only annul an assessment determined by the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue on merits. The dicta in Ismail v Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, Ranaweera v Ramachandran seem to me to be lending

support for the latter view.

31

In Ranaweera v. Ramachandran [(Sri Lanka Tax Cases (Vol 2) 395], the Privy Council

held that members of the Board of Review were not judicial officers. The Privy Council

there cited the following passage from Inland Revenue Commissioners V Sneath [(1932)

2 KB 362]:

I think the estimating authorities, even where an appeal is made to them, are not acting

as judges deciding litigation between the subject and the crown. They are merely in the

position of valuers whose proceedings are regulated by statute to enable them to make

an estimate of the income of the tax payer for the particular year in question. The nature

of the legislation for the imposition of taxes making it necessary that the statute should

provide for some machinery whereby the taxable income is ascertained, that machinery

is set going separately for each year of tax, and though the figure determined is final for

that year, it is not final for any other purpose. It is final not as a judgment inter partes

but as the final estimate of the statutory estimating body. No lis comes into existence until

there has been a final estimate of the income which determines the tax payable. There

can be no lis until the rights and duties are settled and thereafter questioned by litigation.

Romer LJ added (p 390)

But the only thing that the Commissioners have jurisdiction to decide directly and

as a substantive matter is the amount of the tax payers income for the year in question

.On the whole of the material put before them on this part of the case their lordships

conclusion is that the Board of Review does not exercise judicial power but is one of the

instruments created for the administration of the Income Tax Ordinance and that as such

its work is administrative, though judicial qualities are called for in its performance.

In order to arrive at a decision in this regard, consideration must be given to several

matters including the following:

(a) The historical role of the Board of Review and the Tax Appeals Commission

32

(b) Whether the TAC was created with the intention of exercising powers akin to the

Court of Appeal in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 140 of the

Constitution?

(c) Whether the TAC has the capacity to exercise such powers?

(d) Whether the exercise of such powers constitute the exercise of judicial powers?

(e) Which interpretation will provide for a harmonious, efficient and effective

functioning of the revenue collection statutes, whilst ensuring fairness to the tax

payer?

(f) Which interpretation will minimize delay and litigation?

(g) Would the TAC be entitled to use the entire gamut of administrative law principles

in determining issues before it, including principles of proportionality,

reasonableness etc.?

While the above matters and more particularly whether the TAC has the authority to deal

with matters not concerning the merits of the appeal will have to be considered and

answered by this Court in a suitable case, there is no necessity to consider such issues in

this appeal if it is approached in the following manner.

It is clear that if the TAC only has the power to decide on the merits of the appeal, then

the question of remitting a matter that deals with an issue other than the merits to the

Commissioner General does not arise. The TAC would be wrong in entertaining such a

matter. If that is the case, then this Court should remit the matter to the TAC to hear the

dispute on its merits.

33

If the TAC can examine matters other than the merits, then does the TAC have the power

to remit such other matter [i.e. a matter not relating to the substantive tax issue] to the

Commissioner General? In my view, if the TAC has the power to examine matters other

than the merits, then the power of remission too should include the power to remit the

case on matters other than on merit. If it is assumed that the TAC does have the power to

examine matters other than the substantive tax matter, then my brothers analysis

explaining why the TAC should have the power to remit this matter to the Commissioner

General is persuasive. I would only add that if the matter is so remitted, it does not mean

that the Commissioner General has unlimited time to make such determination. He

would need to do so within a reasonable time, which in the circumstances of the scheme

of the Act cannot exceed the time set out in Section 34(8) from the date of reference.

However, I am of the view that even if the TAC could have remitted the matter to the

Commissioner General it would not be reasonable to do so at this juncture after the lapse

of more than 10 years. Given the extensive powers vested in the TAC in hearing an appeal

and set out at the outset of this judgment, I am of the opinion that even if the TAC could

remit the matter to the Commissioner General it should not do so, and that it should

proceed to hear the matter on the merits.

In the above circumstances, the TAC and the Court of Appeal were in error in failing to

ensure that the matter is not disposed of on the merits by the TAC.

In view of the above finding, the questions of law raised need not be answered. The

decision of the Court of Appeal and the TAC are set aside and the matter is remitted to

the TAC for a hearing on the merits. In view of the long delay the TAC is directed to

conclude the hearing expeditiously.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT
