"S.C. (FR) No. 236/2013"
"construction  and  not  merely  repaired  a  damaged  or  an  uninhabitable"
"building that stood on the occupied land."
"Strangely,  none  of 
the  Petitioners  did  offer  any  additional"
"material to indicate that the 20 perch land occupied by the Army with a"
"building  on  it  falls  within  the  boundaries  of  any  or  more  of  the  three"
"lots to which they claim title. In other words,  it was imperative for the"
"Petitioners  to satisfy this Court that any one or more of them had title"
"to  the  20  perch  land  occupied  by  the  Army.  The  Petitioners  have  filed"
"their  petitions  in  2013.  Statement  of  Objections  of  the  1st  Respondent"
"were 
tendered 
to  Court 
in  2017  and 
the  Petitioners  countered 
the"
"assertions  made  in  the  objections  with  their  counter  affidavits  filed  in"
"2018."
"Given  the  fact  that  the  existence  of  a  building  is  clearly  visible"
"through  a 
fence,  unlike  a  building  constructed  within  a  premises"
"surrounded  by  high  parapet  walls  and  thereby  totally  blocking  any"
"visual access, the reason as to why none of the Petitioners referred to a"
"building  put  up  by  the  Army  on  their  lands  and  thus  limiting  their"
"allegation  only  to  the  act  of  fencing  is  somewhat 
intriguing.  If  the"
"building  was  constructed  after 
the  petitions  were 
tendered 
to 
this"
"Court,  the  Petitioners  could  have  easily  clarified  that  position,  despite"
"the absence to any reference to a construction in their original petitions."
"In  these  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  considered  view  that each  of"
"the  Petitioners  have 
failed 
to 
satisfy 
this  Court  on  a  balance  of"
"probabilities  that  their  lands  were  occupied  by  one  or  more  of  the"
"Respondents  as  alleged.  Their  failure  to  exclude  the  probability  of  the"
"location of the 20 perch land under occupation within the northern part"
"14"
