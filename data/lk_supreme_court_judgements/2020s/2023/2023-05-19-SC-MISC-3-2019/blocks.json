With regard to item no.01 above, it must be noted that it is not uncommon for family members of judges or their colleagues in the University or Law College engaging in the legal profession and practicing in courts. They are independent adults who in their own right engage in the profession. The mere fact that such relationship exists between a family member of the judge and a junior counsel of the team of counsel representing one of the parties before the judge per se is not a ground to allege bias against the judge. Other than the presiding Judges sons association with the Junior counsel for the Plaintiff- Appellant in the Appeal in a different case, no specific interest or a pecuniary interest of the presiding judge has been averred with regard to the subject matter in the instant application. In relation to item no.2 above, as observed above the difference in the date is found in the copy published in the Web and not in the official copy found in the case record. Even a typographical error in a judgement including an error relating to the date can be corrected using the inherent powers of the court. In that context, an error found in a web copy published by the Registry appears to be a far-fetched reason to blame the relevant Judges. Nonetheless, this court need not go into the merits of this allegations and make final conclusion over such allegations due to the preliminary objection taken by the opposite party which has to be upheld due to reasons given later in this order.",

This application does not fall within the ambit of (a) to (f) mentioned above. The Defendant Petitioner failed to draw the attention of this court to any law passed by the Parliament that empowers this court to entertain and hear an appeal or review or revision over a decision of this court made in relation to a final appeal and this court is unaware of any such law that gives a right of appeal or revision or review over a judgment of a final appeal made by this court. Hence this application does not fall within the ambit of Article 118(g) mentioned above. As stated in Jayaraj Fernanadopulle V Premachandra de Silva (1996) 1 S L R 70 our Supreme Court is a Creature of Statute and its powers are statutory. Thus, the scope of its power has to be limited to what is laid down by the Statutes but for the inherent powers any court has to meet the ends of justice and to prevent abuse of process. This court has no statutory jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution or by any other law to rehear, review, alter or vary its decision. Its decisions are final.",

For clarification of its order or judgment or to correct any accidental omissions or slips or clerical or arithmetical mistakes, a court may revisit a concluded matter. In the same way courts, to meet the ends of justice may vacate its decisions made in per incuriam. In its restricted sense a decision made in per incuriam means a decision made in ignorance or forgetfulness of an existing statute or a binding decision. [ for restricted interpretation of per incuriam concept, see Huddersfield Police Authority V Watson (1947) 1 All E R 193, Alasupillai V Yavetpillai (1949) 39 C L W 107, Hettiarachchi V Seneviratne, Deputy Bribery Commissioner and Others (No.2) (1994) 3 Sri L R 293.] However, the dictionary meaning of the Latin term per incuriam appears to connote something similar to through lack of care. [ for a broader meaning of per incuriam, see Gunasena V Bandaratilleke (2000) 1 Sri L R 292 at 301 and 302 and Kariawasam V Priyadharshani (2004) 1 Sri L R 189]. Adopting the extreme wider meaning represented by the said dictionary meaning may become an obstacle to reach finality in litigation, since lack of care may even appear in evaluation of evidential material after every party is given a chance to present their stances and evidence. Anyway, our courts on certain occasions, where mistake was so obvious, have used the per incuriam concept in much wider meaning than Lord Goddards interpretation in Huddersfield Police Authority V Watson above. [for such wider application see King V Baron (1926) 4 Times of Ceylon Reports 3, The Police Officer of Mawalla V Galapatha (1915) 1 C W R 197, V.A. Ranmenika V B. A. S. Tissera 65 N L R 214, Kariawasam V Priyadharshani (supra) and Gunasena V Bandaratillake (supra)]. However, it must be noted that this application does not allege any accidental omission or slip or any clerical or arithmetical errors. Neither it requires any clarification of the judgment made in the final appeal nor it alleges any unintentional obvious mistake and/or error. The Defendant Petitioner does not allege that the impugned judgment was made in per incuriam whether in its restricted or wider sense. Thus, this application does not fall under those categories to reconsider the order made. If the allegations fell under those categories, it could have been considered in a better way by the same judges who delivered the judgment. It is clear from the record that the Defendant Petitioner was objecting for the same judges who delivered the judgement considering this application. The allegation made in this application contemplates a sort of a new cause of action against the judges who heard and decided the final appeal for them being bias and /or being acted in a fraudulent manner and/or involved in fabricating false evidence etc. which allegedly represents an intentional wrongdoing by the said judges.",
