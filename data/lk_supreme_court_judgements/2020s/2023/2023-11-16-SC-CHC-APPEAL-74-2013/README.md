The Plaintiff Bank has instituted this action in the Commercial High Court of Western Province

(Holden in Colombo) against the three Defendants mentioned in the caption, to recover from

them jointly and severally a sum of Rs. 5,130,648.56, together with legal interest until the

completion of the payment in full.

The 1st Defendant which is a company is the principal borrower. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants

are the sole Directors of the 1st Defendant Company who stood to guarantee the repayment

of the said sum of money borrowed by the 1st Defendant from the Plaintiff Bank. It is a notable

feature that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are husband and wife. All three Defendants had filed

a joint Answer praying for the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court by his

judgment dated 28-08-2012, has held that the Plaintiff is entitled to all the relief as prayed

for in the prayers to the Plaint against the Defendants and directed that the decree be entered

accordingly. Being aggrieved by the said judgment pronounced by the Commercial High Court,

all three Defendants lodged the instant appeal to this Court.

In the course of the hearing of this appeal before us, the Defendants did not dispute the fact

that the Plaintiff Bank has credited a sum of Rs. 5,687,000.00 to the 1st Defendants Current

Account. The Statement of Accounts pertaining to the term loan relevant to the instant action

has been produced in the trial marked P 3 and the relevant entry therein has been produced

marked P 3(a).

In the course of the hearing, the primary argument advanced by the Defendants is that no

physical transfer of cash from the Plaintiff Bank to the 1st Defendant had taken place. The

Defendants also sought to argue that the documents relevant to the granting of the relevant

term loan facility were blank when they signed them.

However, we observe that the Defendants had not been successful in challenging these

positions in the trial. We note that the process of borrowing by the 1st Defendant had been as

per the letter of offer produced in the trial marked P 1. We also find that the Statement of

Account pertaining to the term loan (P 3) and the relevant entry therein [P 3(a)] have

successfully proved in the trial the fact that the Plaintiff Bank has credited a sum of Rs.

5,687,000.00 to the 1st Defendants Current Account.

Moreover, it could be seen that the 1st Defendant had proceeded to repay several installments

subsequent to the receipt of the relevant term loan facility. This is borne out of the loan

account statement produced in the trial marked P 4. In our view, in light of the facts and

circumstances of this case, repayment of several installments is a clear proof not only of the

fact that the 1st Defendant had obtained the relevant term loan facility from the Plaintiff, but

also the fact that the Defendants liability to repay the sum borrowed.

In view of the above as well as in view of the other factual circumstances in this case, we see

no basis as to why the Defendants should succeed in this appeal.

Having perused the judgment of the learned Commercial High Court Judge, we observe that

the learned Commercial High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence adduced by both

parties, analyzed and duly considered the documents produced in the trial before coming to

the correct conclusion in the case.

We have no basis to interfere with the conclusion reached by the learned Commercial High

Court Judge. We proceed to dismiss this appeal but without costs.
