"are the sole Directors of the 1st Defendant Company who stood to guarantee the repayment"
"of the said sum of money borrowed by the 1st Defendant from the Plaintiff Bank. It is a notable"
"feature that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are husband and wife. All three Defendants had filed"

fter  the  conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Commercial  High  Court  by  his"
"judgment dated 28-08-2012, has held that the Plaintiff is entitled to all the relief as prayed"
"for in the prayers to the Plaint against the Defendants and directed that the decree be entered"
"accordingly. Being aggrieved by the said judgment pronounced by the Commercial High Court,"
"all three Defendants lodged the instant appeal to this Court."
"In the course of the hearing of this appeal before us, the Defendants did not dispute the fact"
"that the Plaintiff Bank has credited a sum of Rs. 5,687,000.00 to the 1st Defendant’s Current"
"Account. The Statement of Accounts pertaining to the term loan relevant to the instant action"

"term loan facility were blank when they signed them."
"H
owever,  we  observe  that  the  Defendants  had  not  been  successful  in  challenging  these"
"positions in the trial. We note that the process of borrowing by the 1st Defendant had been as"
"per the letter of offer produced in the trial marked P 1. We also find that the Statement of"
"Account  pertaining  to  the  term  loan  (P  3)  and  the  relevant  entry  therein  [P  3(a)]  have"
"successfully  proved  in  the  trial  the  fact  that  the  Plaintiff  Bank  has  credited  a  sum  of  Rs."
"5,687,000.00 to the 1st Defendant’s Current Account."
