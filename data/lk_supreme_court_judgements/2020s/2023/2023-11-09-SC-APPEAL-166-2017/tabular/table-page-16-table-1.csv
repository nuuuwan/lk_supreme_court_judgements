"It appears that the 3rd Respondent had been under the impression that",""
"alienations were effected without the consent of the Divisional Secretary",""

"if  both  the  Deed  of  Renunciation  and  the  Deed  of  Declaration  were",""
"declared null and void, it is not correct to say that the second son did not",""
