"21 
SC/APPEAL/166/2017"
"According 
to  Spencer  Bower  and  Turner 
(op. 
cit.)  at  page  116"
"“representee” is not limited to parties directly involved but includes any"
"party  to  whose  notice  the  representation  should  reach  as  per  the"
"intention  of  the  “representor”;  this  intention  may  be  inferred  if  the"
"representor  had  knowledge  that  such  representation  would  reach  the"
"third party in the ordinary course of business."
"The 5th Respondent made the representation directly to Wickramasekara"
"Bandara.  Yet  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  act  of  renouncing"
"interest in the holding is one which would reach the other heirs in the"
"line of succession within his family."
"After the renunciation of the right to succession by the 5th Respondent in"
"favour 
of  Wickramasekara 
Bandara 
and 
after 
the 
death 
of"
"Wickramasekara  Bandara,  the  Petitioner  had  a  legitimate  expectation"
"that she should succeed to the holding according to Rule 1 of the Third"
"Schedule."
"If the 5th Respondent failed/showed unwillingness/renounced his right"
"to  succeed,  the  6th  Respondent  being  the  son  of  the  5th  Respondent"
"cannot claim right to succeed in terms of Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of"
"the  Land  Development  Ordinance  since 
(a) 
the  chain  of 
inter  alia"
"succession  had  been  severed,  and  (b)  by  operation  of  the  doctrine  of"
"estoppel."
"The 6th Respondent who is the son of the 5th Respondent is bound by the"
"representation made by his father."
"Conclusion"
"For 
the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  answer  both  questions  of 
law 
in 
the"
"affirmative and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal."
