SC/APPEAL/166/2017"
"The  fallacy  of  this  argument  is  made  clear  when  the  learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor  General 
for  the  Respondent  state  officials  and  the  learned"
"counsel for the 6th Respondent admit that, if the said brother of the 5th"
"Respondent, namely Wickremasekara Bandara, nominated a successor,"
"the  5th  Respondent  or  his  son  the  6th  Respondent  could  not  have"
"reclaimed succession to the holding."
"I am unable to agree with the finding of the Court of Appeal that, since"
"Wickremasekara Bandara died without nominating a successor, the 5th"
"Respondent becomes entitled to succession of the holding by operation"
"of Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of the Ordinance. This finding of the Court"
"of  Appeal  is  contradictory  to  its  earlier  findings  that  (a)  since  the  5th"
"Respondent  did  not  succeed  to  the  holding,  Wickremasekara  Bandara"
"succeeded  to  it  by  operation  of  law,  and  (b)  the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance does not prohibit renunciation of rights."
"All the six elements necessary for a successful plea of estoppel do exist"
"in this case."
"In the course of the argument, it was also asserted that even if the 5th"
"Respondent  renounced  his  rights  and  interests  in  the  holding,  the  6th"
"Respondent, who is the son of the 5th Respondent, is not bound by such"
"renunciation. This is covered under the last element of section 115 of the"
"Evidence Ordinance mentioned above, i.e. the question must arise in the"
"suit  or  proceeding  between  the  same  persons  or  their  representatives"
"(privies).  In  elaborating  the  last  element,  Coomaraswamy  at  page  192"
"states,  “this means  that estoppels  are usually binding upon parties  and"
"their privies.” It is further stated that privies can be privies in blood such"
"as heirs, privies by estate such as lessees and assignees, and privies in"
"law such as executors and administrators."
