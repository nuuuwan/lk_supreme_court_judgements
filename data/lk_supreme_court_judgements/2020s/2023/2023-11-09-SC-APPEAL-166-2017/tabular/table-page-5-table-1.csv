"Samayawardhena, J."
"Background facts"
"The father of the Petitioner-Appellant, namely Podi Bandara, was issued"
"two  grants  in  respect  of  two  parcels  of  land 
in  terms  of  the  Land"
"Development  Ordinance,  No.  19  of  1935,  as  amended.  His  wife"
"predeceased him. They had five children. The first two are sons and the"
"other  three  are  daughters.  The  eldest  son  is  the  5th  Respondent.  The"
"second  son,  namely  Wickramasekara  Bandara,  was  not  a  party  to  this"
"case. The Petitioner is the eldest daughter."
"There is a difference between a “permit” and a “grant”."
"In terms of section 2 of the Land Development Ordinance, land alienated"
"by grant under the Land Development Ordinance is known as a “holding”."
"The “owner” means the owner of a holding whose title thereto is derived"
"from  a  grant  issued  in  terms  of  the  Ordinance  and  includes  a  permit-"
"holder who has paid all sums which he is required to pay under section"
"19(2)  and  has  complied  with  all  the  other  conditions  specified  in  the"
"permit."
"Section 19(6)(b) enacts that the owner of a holding shall not dispose of"
"such  holding  except  with  the  prior  approval  of  the  Government  Agent."
"However,  section  19(7)  recognises  that  the  approval  of  the  Divisional"
"Secretary 
is  not  required  when  mortgaging  such  holding 
to  some"
"institutions  including  licensed  commercial  banks.  According  to  section"
"46, a permit-holder cannot dispose of the land alienated to him on the"
"permit without the written consent of the Government Agent. As section"
"2  defines,  “disposition”  means  any 
transaction  of  whatever  nature"
"affecting land or the title thereto, and “title” means right, title, or interest"
"to or in the land or holding."
