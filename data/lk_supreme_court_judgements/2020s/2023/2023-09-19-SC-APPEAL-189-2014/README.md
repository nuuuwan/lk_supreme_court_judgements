DECIDED ON: 19-09-2023.

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

The original Plaintiff in this case had filed plaint against the original Defendant praying inter

alia :

i. for a declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the land relevant to this case.

ii. for an order ejecting the Defendant and his representatives from the relevant land.

The Defendant filing the amended answer has taken up the position that he had transferred

this land by Deed No. 11763 dated 16-05-1980 to the Plaintiff as he was in an urgent need

of money at or about the time he had executed that deed.

Indeed, it must be observed that in paragraph 5 of the answer, it is the position of the

Defendant that he was in need of this money at the time of executing the deed or before the

said execution. It was in following terms that the Defendant had averred that position in

paragraph 5 of the answer:

The parties have recorded an admission that the Deed No. 11763 dated 16-05-1980 has been

executed. It is by the said Deed No. 11763 that the Plaintiff had purchased the land from the

Defendant. At the outset, it must be observed that the following issues have been raised by

the Defendant.

Issue No. 06.

06 , . 10,000

Issue No. 07.

Since the above issues have been raised by the Defendant, one would expect the Defendant

to have adduced evidence relevant to those issues. On the other hand, it is the Defendant

who claims that there is a constructive trust in this case and that he did not intend to part the

beneficial interest to the Plaintiff by the execution of the said deed. Therefore, the burden is

on the Defendant to prove that there in fact exists a constructive trust.

It is the position of the Defendant that he had borrowed Rs. 10,000/- from the Plaintiff in

order to purchase this land from Siripala. It is his evidence that he had collected Rs. 15,000/-

from his garage and borrowed Rs. 10,000/- more from the Plaintiff and used the total sum of

money i.e., Rs. 25,000/- to pay Siripala to purchase this land.

At the outset, it must be noted according to Deed No. 11634 that the Defendant had

purchased a land from Siripala on 31-03-1980 for a sum of Rs. 25,000/-.

According to the Plaintiffs Deed No. 11763, the Plaintiff had purchased half of this land from

the Defendant on 16-05-1980, which is two months after the date the Defendant had

purchased the whole land from Siripala.

Therefore, the evidence of the Defendant in this regard taken alone, in our view, does not

establish the fact that he had borrowed Rs. 10,000/- from the Plaintiff for the purpose he

claims, as per the issues raised. However, since the court must consider all circumstances

together in a case of this nature, we will proceed to consider the other aspects of the case as

well.

Plaintiff has produced the document marked P 5 signed by the Defendant. P 5 is dated 29-

03-1980. In P 5, the Defendant has stated that he has accepted Rs. 20,000/- from the Plaintiff

agreeing to sell the relevant land to the Plaintiff. The words used in P 5 are:

. 20,000

[SC Appeal 189/2014] Page 6 of 8

Although the learned Counsel who appeared for the Defendant had stated to Court in the

course of the trial, that this document must be marked subject to proof, we observe that the

Defendant had admitted the fact that he has signed this document. However, it is the position

of the Defendant that he had only signed a blank document. The Defendant had been content

with the bare statement that he had only signed a blank document. He had failed to adduce

any further proof in that regard. As opposed to that, since the Defendant had admitted the

fact that he has signed this document, we cannot hold that the Plaintiff has not proved on a

balance of probability, the document marked P 5.

We observe that the document P 5 is dated 29-03-1980, which is a date two days before the

date on which the Deed No. 11634 was executed for Rs. 25,000/-. (Deed No. 11634 was

executed on 31-03-1980)

Indeed P 5 establishes or corroborates the fact that the Plaintiff pursuant to P 5, had indeed

proceeded to purchase on 16-05-1980, Lot 02 of Plan No. 838 dated 12-05-1980 prepared by

D. G. Mendis Licenced Surveyor, from the Defendant for Rs. 10,000/-. It must be noted that

what the Defendant had promised in P 5 is to sell half of that land to the Plaintiff. Therefore,

we do not see any discrepancy or contradiction between P 5 or the making of P 5 and the

execution of the Deed No. 11763 on 16-05-1980 produced marked P 3. Thus, P 5 is not

sufficient to establish that the Defendant had not intended to part with his beneficial interest

in the property to the Plaintiff. The presence of Plan No. 838 dated 12-05-1980 would also

negate such a position.

Since the Defendant had only adduced his bare statement that he signed the blank document

(P 5), having regard to the totality of evidence adduced in the case, on a balance of

probability, we are inclined to accept the evidence of the Plaintiff with regard to this aspect.

It was argued on behalf of the Defendant that the fact that the Defendant is still in possession,

must be treated as an attendant circumstance in this case.

[SC Appeal 189/2014] Page 7 of 8

The fact that the Defendant is in possession of the relevant land is not disputed by the

Defendant. However, learned counsel for the Plaintiff referred us to page 236 of the appeal

brief to convince us that the Plaintiff appears to have permitted the Defendant directly or

indirectly to continue to occupy the land as there was a friendship between them. We also

observe that it is in evidence that the Plaintiff and the Defendant are not strangers to each

other as the Plaintiff had taken his vehicles for the purpose of repair, to the garage run by

the Defendant.

In view of such facts, we are not inclined to hold that the mere continuation of possession by

the Defendant would itself amount to an attendant circumstance in this case.

Another feature that is present in this case is the fact that it was the Plaintiff who had paid

the stamp fees and the fees of the Notary. Moreover, we also observe that the Plan No. 838

produced marked P 1 has been prepared on 12-05-1980. It was pursuant to this plan that

the Deed No. 11763 was executed by the Defendant on 16-05-1980. The payment of the

stamp fees and the Notarys fees by the Plaintiff, taken together with the fact that the Plan

No. 838 has been prepared just four days prior to the deed executed by the Defendant, in

our view, is not in favor of establishing a constructive trust as claimed by the Defendant, but

indicative of the fact that the Defendant had intended to part with his beneficial interest in

the property to the Plaintiff.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant also submitted that there was a construction

in the nature of a permanent structure which occupies both Lot 1 and Lot 2 in Plan No. 838

(P 1). Based on that fact, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant sought to argue

that this fact would be indicative of the fact that the Defendant may never have intended to

part with Lot 2 to the Plaintiff as his garage was partly situated in Lot 2 as well.

However, according to the document produced by the Defendant marked V 6 we observe

that the said structure is not a permanent structure.

This court on the date the Leave to Appeal Application relevant to this appeal was supported,

by its order dated 15-10-2014 has granted Leave to Appeal on the following question.

[SC Appeal 189/2014] Page 8 of 8

8

Do the facts and circumstances prove the existence of a trust?

For the foregoing reasons, we proceed to answer the question of law in respect of which

this court has granted Leave to Appeal, in the negative.

We are of the view that both the learned District Judge and the learned Judge of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals had come to the correct conclusion. We proceed to affirm both

the judgment dated 11-01-2005 pronounced by the learned District Judge and the judgment

dated 10-07-2012 pronounced by the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals.

We proceed to dismiss this appeal without costs.

Appeal is dismissed.
