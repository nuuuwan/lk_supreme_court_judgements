"“සංශ ෝධිත උත්තරශේ 07 වන ශේදශේ සඳහන් පරිදි පැමිණිලිකරු එම මුදල ලබා දීමට ශමම නඩුවට"
"අදාළ ඉඩම ඇපයක් ව ශයන් තබන ශලස ඉල්ලා සිටින ලද්ශද්ද”"
"S
ince the above issues have been raised by the Defendant, one would expect the Defendant"
"to have adduced evidence relevant to those issues. On the other hand, it is the  Defendant"
"who claims that there is a constructive trust in this case and that he did not intend to part the"
"beneficial interest to the Plaintiff by the execution of the said deed. Therefore, the burden is"
"on the Defendant to prove that there in fact exists a constructive trust."
"I
t is the position of the Defendant that he had borrowed Rs. 10,000/- from the Plaintiff in"
"order to purchase this land from Siripala. It is his evidence that he had collected Rs. 15,000/-"
"from his garage and borrowed Rs. 10,000/- more from the Plaintiff and used the total sum of"
"money i.e., Rs. 25,000/- to pay Siripala to purchase this land."
"A
t  the  outset,  it  must  be  noted  according  to  Deed  No.  11634  that  the  Defendant  had"
"purchased a land from Siripala on 31-03-1980 for a sum of Rs. 25,000/-."
"A
ccording to the Plaintiff’s Deed No. 11763, the Plaintiff had purchased half of this land from"
"the  Defendant  on  16-05-1980,  which  is  two  months  after  the  date  the  Defendant  had"
"purchased the whole land from Siripala."
"T
herefore, the evidence of the Defendant in this regard taken alone, in our view, does not"
"establish the fact that he had borrowed Rs. 10,000/-  from the  Plaintiff for the purpose he"
"claims, as per the issues raised. However, since the court must consider  all circumstances"
"together in a case of this nature, we will proceed to consider the other aspects of the case as"
"well."
"P
laintiff has produced the document marked P 5 signed by the Defendant. P 5 is dated 29-"
"03-1980. In P 5, the Defendant has stated that he has accepted Rs. 20,000/- from the Plaintiff"
"agreeing to sell the relevant land to the Plaintiff.  The  words used in P 5 are: “ලීසින් මුදලාලි"
"ෙ තාට  විකිණීෙට  හොහරාන්ු  වී  අද  දින  එෙ  ෙ තාහෙන්  ලංකාහේ  වලංගු  මුදලින්  රු.  20,000  ඉල්ලා"
