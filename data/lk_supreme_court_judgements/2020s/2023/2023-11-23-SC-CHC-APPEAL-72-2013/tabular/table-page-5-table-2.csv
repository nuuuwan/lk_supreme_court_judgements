"Hence,  I  propose  to  address  this  contention  after  examining  the  provisions  in  Section"
"192 (1), which reads:"
"“When the action is for a sum of money due to the plaintiff, the court may, in the"
"decree order interest according to the rate agreed on between the parties by the"
"instrument sued on, or in the absence of any such agreement at the rate of twelve"
"per centum per annum to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of"
"the action to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such"
"principal  sum  for  any  period  prior  to  the  institution  of  the  action,  with  further"
"interest  at  such  rate  on  the  aggregate  sum  so  adjudged,  from  the  date  of  the"
"decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit.”"
