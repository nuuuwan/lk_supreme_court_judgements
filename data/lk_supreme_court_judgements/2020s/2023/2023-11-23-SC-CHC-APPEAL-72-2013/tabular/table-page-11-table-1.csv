"The  ambit  of  Section  5  of  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  was  considered  in  Fernando  and"
"Another  v.  Sillappen  &  Others  [5  C.W.R.  301]  which  was  decided 
in  1918,  where"
"Bertram C.J. explained the meaning of the words “the amount recoverable on account of"
"interest”.  He did so after interpreting Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code to provide"
"for the adjustment of three sums, firstly, the principal sum, secondly, the interest on the"
"principal sum up to the date of action, and in the third place, a supplementary sum in"
"respect of interest from the date of action brought to the date of judgment."
"In so far as the interest is concerned, Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code allows the"
"Court to award interest on the principal sum at the rate agreed between parties firstly,"
"for any period prior to the institution of the action, and secondly, from the date of action"
"to the date of the decree. Furthermore, the Court is competent to grant interest on the"
"total amount decided upon from the date of the decree to the date of payment."
"Bertram C.J. [ibid., page 303] took the view that the words “the amount recoverable on"
"account  of 
interest” 
in  Section  5  of  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  did  not  apply  to  the"
"aggregate amount made up of the two sums of “interest”, i.e., firstly, the interest due up"
"to  the  date  of  action  brought,  and  secondly,  the  interest  due  from  the  date  of  action"
"brought to the date of judgment."
"In other words, the prohibition in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance applies only to the"
"amount  of  interest  due  on  the  principal  sum  as  at  the  date  of  the  institution  of  the"
"action."
"This prohibition does not apply to the power vested in Court in terms of Section 192 of"
"the  Civil  Procedure  Code  to  award  interest  on  the  principal  sum  according  to  the  rate"
