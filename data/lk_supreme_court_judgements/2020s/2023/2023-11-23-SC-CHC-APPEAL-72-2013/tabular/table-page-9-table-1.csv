"It  is  possible  that  the  rule  was  incorporated  into  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  to  overcome"
"the apprehension of the English judges in enforcing it as part of Roman-Dutch law. It is"
"thus clear that Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance is in fact based on the principle in"
"the Roman-Dutch Law inasmuch such principle was not known to English law."
"It has been confirmed in Lucia Perera v. Albert Fernando (1 C.L.W. 107) that the rule in"
"Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance is a restatement of the Roman-Dutch law rule."
"Walter Pereira in Laws of Ceylon  [supra.] states that where interest is paid from time to"
"time there is no  limit  to the amount which  may be recovered as interest. The amount"
"already  paid  may  exceed  the  principal.  Still,  the  creditor  is  entitled  to  recover  a  sum"
"equal to the principal as interest."
"It  appears  that  Pereira  was  of  the  view  that  if  interest  is  paid  periodically,  there  is  no"
"limit  to  the  amount  that  can  be  recovered  as  interest.  He  relies  on  two  authorities,"
"Coomarevelo v. Sittarapuwalpillai (4 S.C.C. 28) and Sidenberenada v. Sangarapulle (sic)"
"[supra.] for this proposition. Let me examine them to test the validity of this proposition."
"In Sinnathamby Cumaraveley and another v. Muttutamby Sitterapuvalpulley [(1881) 4"
"S.C.C. 28] the headnote states that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action his"
"principal  and  all  arrears  of  interest  then  due  up  to  the  amount  of  the  principal.  The"
"principal sum borrowed in that case was rupees 5,000. Cayley C.J. states [ibid., page 29]"
"that “the plaintiff cannot recover more than 5,000 rupees”. The only principle sought to"
"be made is that there is nothing preventing the obligee of a bond from recovering at any"
"time  arrears  of  interest  equal  to  the  principal,  however  much  interest  he  may  have"
"previously received."
"In Sedembranader v. Sangerapulle [supra.], the Court considered the rule as part of the"
"Roman-Dutch  law  and  not  in  the  context  of  Section  5  of  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance.  It  is"
"clear that the learned judge was under a misapprehension about the ambit of the rule"
