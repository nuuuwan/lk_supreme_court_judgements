Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (Respondent) instituted this action against the Defendants-

Appellants (Appellants) to recover a sum of Rs. 12,433,028/= and interest thereon.

Admittedly, on 17.01.2006, a sum of Rs. 3,000,000/= was lent by the Respondent to the

Appellants as a housing loan. The property more fully described in the schedule to the

plaint was mortgaged by Mortgage Bond No. 486 as security.

At the trial, the Appellants admitted the due execution of Mortgage Bond No. 486 and

the receipt of a sum of Rs. 3 million in accordance with the said Mortgage Bond.

On behalf of the Respondent, the Chief Financial Officer gave evidence and marked

documents X1 to X10 as evidence. None of them were marked subject to proof. They

included the statement of accounts (X9), letters of demand (X7 and X8), and the reply of

the Appellants (X10) to the letter of demand (X8).

On behalf of the Appellants, only the 1st Appellant gave evidence.

Page 3 of 15

The only defenses raised by the Appellants at the trial were that the contents of the

Mortgage Bond were not explained prior to signing and that the statement of account

was incorrect.

The learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo (Commercial High Court) rejected these contentions and entered judgment as

prayed for in the plaint.

In this appeal, the Appellants seek to assail the judgment of the learned Commercial

High Court Judge on the following three grounds:

(1) The amount of Rs. 12,433,028/= sought to be recovered by the Respondent is not

recoverable in terms of Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code and the law of

contracts;

(2) Awarding interest on Rs. 12,420,504/= is contrary to section 192 of the Civil

Procedure Code; and,

(3) Interest granted is contrary to Section 5 of the Introduction of Law of England

Ordinance, No. 5 of 1852 (Civil Law Ordinance).

According to the Appellant, in the statement of account marked (X9), the amount

claimed by the Respondent includes:

(1) Defaulted instalments (as at 24.11.2006 after deduction of Rs. 158,000/=

payment made by the Appellants) - Rs.

313,101.00

(2) Default charges (interest on defaulted instalments) - Rs. 12,524.00

(3) Future Rentals (from 24.11.2006 to December 2026) - Rs. 12,107,403.00

Total - Rs. 12,432,028.00

Page 4 of 15

The Appellants contend that in terms of the law, the said amount of Rs. 12,432,028/=

includes:

(a) Balance principal sum;

(b) Interest accrued on the principal sum prior to the institution of the action;

(c) Interest on the defaulted installments (compound interest); and,

(d) Future interest since 24.11.2006 to January 2026.

It should be noted that there is no record of the Respondent being awarded future

interest until January 2026. The statement of accounts (X9) claims that the total

outstanding balance in respect of the loan agreement as at 25.11.2006 is Rs.

12,489,072.36, with an additional interest rate of 4% per month from 25.11.2006 on the

balance of rentals receivable until payment is made in full.

In terms of the second schedule to Mortgage Bond No. 486 (X4), the Appellants agreed

to pay the principal sum of Rs. 3,000,000/= with 21% interest thereon in equated

monthly instalments of Rs. 52,413/= in 240 months. Hence, a sum of Rs. 12,579,120/=

(Rs. 52,413/= x 240) should have been paid over 20 years by the Appellants if they were

to fully perform their obligations in terms of the agreement.

The statement of account (X9) shows that the sum of Rs. 12,489,072.36 claimed by the

Respondent has been arrived at after deducting payments made amounting to Rs.

158,616/= from Rs. 12,579,120/= (Rs. 12,420,504/=) plus a few other charges. Therefore,

it is clear that the Respondent claimed only what it was entitled to in terms of the

agreement between the parties and the interest thereon from the date of the action to

the date of the judgment and to the full payment thereof.

Page 5 of 15

The question to be determined is whether the sum claimed can be granted in

accordance with Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code. According to the Appellants,

the Court cannot grant compound interest under Section 192(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code.

Hence, I propose to address this contention after examining the provisions in Section

192 (1), which reads:

When the action is for a sum of money due to the plaintiff, the court may, in the

decree order interest according to the rate agreed on between the parties by the

instrument sued on, or in the absence of any such agreement at the rate of twelve

per centum per annum to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of

the action to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such

principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the action, with further

interest at such rate on the aggregate sum so adjudged, from the date of the

decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit.

These provisions specify the period and at what rate interest on money may be

calculated. It deals with three distinct periods.

Firstly, it deals with interest prior to the institution of the action. Interest can be charged

on the principal sum for any period prior to the commencement of the action at the rate

agreed upon by the parties.

Secondly, interest can be charged on the principal sum to be paid from the date of the

action until the date of the decree.

Thirdly, interest can be ordered on the aggregate sum so judged, from the date of the

decree to the date of payment or such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.

Page 6 of 15

I need not examine the rate at which interest may be ordered since the contention of

the Appellants is on the type of interest that can be ordered and not the rate at which it

can be done.

Compound interest (anatocismus) is the interest that is calculated based on the principal

and any accumulated interest. On the question of compound interest, it appears that at

one time the law was disconcerting.

Let me begin the analysis by considering the position in Roman law and Roman-Dutch

law.

In Roman Law, interest was due either by agreement or by rule of law. The promise of

interest usually requires stipulatio, a contract in the form of verbal question and answer.

Lee [The Elements of Roman Law, 4th ed. (Sweet & Maxwell, Reprint 2007), page 291]

states that [b]efore Justinian the law forbade the parties to agree in advance that the

loan should bear compound interest. Justinian (very absurdly) forbade it as regards

accrued interest as well; that is to say, the parties were not allowed to convert accrued

interest into an interest-bearing loan by a new agreement.

Grotius [The Introduction to Dutch Jurisprudence, Translated by Charles Herbert (London:

John Van Voorst and another, 1844), page 326] states that it is for good reasons

forbidden to heap up and add the unpaid interest to the capital, and again stipulate for a

profit thereon (Anatocismus); because parties who do not look into consequences are

thereby effectually ruined.

Van Der Linden [Institutes of the Laws of Holland, Translated by J. Henry (London, 1828),

page 219] states that interest upon interest is not allowed, nor to be turned into

principal, so as to increase the original debt.

It is evident that compound interest was not permitted under both Roman law and

Roman-Dutch law.

Page 7 of 15

It appears that at first, it was thought that this principle was part of our law.

Walter Pereira in Institutes of the Laws of Ceylon [Vol. II (H.C. Cottle acting

Government Printer, 1901), page 547] states that compound interest, that is interest

upon interest, is not allowed [Vand. D.C. 57] even though expressly stipulated for [Pulle v.

Tamby Cando, Ram. Rep. 1872-1876, 189. See Cens. For. 1.4.4.27].

This principle was adopted in Mudiyanse v. Vanderpoorten [23 N.L.R. 342] and

Obeyesekere v. Fonseka [36 N.L.R. 334], an authority relied on by the Appellants, where

it was held that Roman-Dutch law does not allow compound interest even though

expressly stipulated for.

Nevertheless, in Abeydeera v. Ramanathan Chettiar [38 N.L.R. 389], it was held that in

Ceylon (as it was then) compound interest may be recovered where the party charged

has agreed to pay it. In Marikar v. Supramaniam Chettiar (44 N.L.R. 409) the majority

held that compound interest is recoverable under the law of Ceylon, although the

question of such a charge may be considered on the reopening of a transaction in terms

of the Money Lending Ordinance. Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance was believed by

the majority to have abolished the Roman-Dutch law rule against compound interest.

Weeramantry in The Law of Contracts [Vol. 2, (Lawman (India) (Pvt.) Ltd., 1969 reprint in

1999), page 925] clarified this position and stated:

The Roman Law prohibited compound interest so also the Roman Dutch Law did

not allow compound interest even though expressly stipulated for, but the Roman-

Dutch law prohibition against compound interest is no longer in force in South

Africa or in Ceylon.

The Court of Appeal in Kiran Atapattu v. Pan Asia Bank Ltd. [(2005) 2 Sri.L.R. 276]

adopted this position.

Page 8 of 15

On the basis of the above authorities and the reasoning therein, I am of the opinion that

compound interest is not prohibited in Sri Lanka. Moreover, there is nothing in Section

192 of the Civil Procedure Code which contradicts this position.

I reject the Appellants' argument that compound interest cannot be claimed by the

Respondent.

Nonetheless, it is important to consider the provisions in Section 5 of the Introduction of

Law of England Ordinance, No. 5 of 1852 (Civil Law Ordinance) which states that the

amount recoverable on account of interest shall in no case exceed the principal amount.

It is interesting to note that although this rule is embodied in an enactment made by the

British, it formed part of Roman-Dutch law.

Van Der Linden [supra.] states that the amount of interest may not exceed the

principal.

Lee [supra.] states that in the classical period arrears of interest, might not be recovered

in any action in excess of the capital. Justinian enacted that the capital might not in any

circumstances yield in interest a sum greater than itself. This meant that when the

capital had doubled it ceased to bear interest.

It appears that due to the genesis of the rule in the Roman-Dutch law, at some point, the

rule was refused to be applied in Ceylon (as it was then) on equitable considerations.

In Sedembranader v. Sangerapulle (Ram. Rep. 1843-1855, 19), decided in 1845 before

the Civil Law Ordinance was enacted in Ceylon (as it then was), Oliphant C.J. commented

that the rule is unknown to the English law and refused to apply the rule as there was no

equity in it.

Page 9 of 15

It is possible that the rule was incorporated into the Civil Law Ordinance to overcome

the apprehension of the English judges in enforcing it as part of Roman-Dutch law. It is

thus clear that Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance is in fact based on the principle in

the Roman-Dutch Law inasmuch such principle was not known to English law.

It has been confirmed in Lucia Perera v. Albert Fernando (1 C.L.W. 107) that the rule in

Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance is a restatement of the Roman-Dutch law rule.

Walter Pereira in Laws of Ceylon [supra.] states that where interest is paid from time to

time there is no limit to the amount which may be recovered as interest. The amount

already paid may exceed the principal. Still, the creditor is entitled to recover a sum

equal to the principal as interest.

It appears that Pereira was of the view that if interest is paid periodically, there is no

limit to the amount that can be recovered as interest. He relies on two authorities,

Coomarevelo v. Sittarapuwalpillai (4 S.C.C. 28) and Sidenberenada v. Sangarapulle (sic)

[supra.] for this proposition. Let me examine them to test the validity of this proposition.

In Sinnathamby Cumaraveley and another v. Muttutamby Sitterapuvalpulley [(1881) 4

S.C.C. 28] the headnote states that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action his

principal and all arrears of interest then due up to the amount of the principal. The

principal sum borrowed in that case was rupees 5,000. Cayley C.J. states [ibid., page 29]

that the plaintiff cannot recover more than 5,000 rupees. The only principle sought to

be made is that there is nothing preventing the obligee of a bond from recovering at any

time arrears of interest equal to the principal, however much interest he may have

previously received.

In Sedembranader v. Sangerapulle [supra.], the Court considered the rule as part of the

Roman-Dutch law and not in the context of Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance. It is

clear that the learned judge was under a misapprehension about the ambit of the rule

Page 10 of 15

for he says the application of the rule means that one who has lent say 100 at ten

percent for ten years, and who has regularly been paid 10 a year as interest, would not

be entitled to demand his 100 at the end of the tenth year, because he had been paid

that sum in the shape of interest.

I am of the view that the above decisions do not support the proposition made by

Pereira [supra] that where interest is paid from time to time there is no limit to the

amount which may be recovered as interest.

However, there appears to be support for a narrower version of Pereira's proposition in

the case of Talpe Gamagey Don Carolis De Silva Appuhami v. Baffamagey Don

Theodoris [(1882-1883) S.C.C. 16] where Clarence A.C.J. held:

running interest stops when the amount in arrear reaches the amount of the

principal, but that if a part-payment of interest be then made, interest may then

run on till the amount of the principal be again reached: and this is in accordance

with the Roman-Dutch Law or practice as described by Voet, who says (xxii, i. 19)

Non iniquum ex nostris moribus visum fuit, durare obligationem usurariam,

donec sors restituta fuerit, etiamsi triplicatoe vel quadruplicatoe sortis supercent

quantitatem, si modo particiulatim soluatoe sint.

According to Roman-Dutch law, running interest stops when the amount in arrears

reaches the principal. However, if part-payment of interest is made thereafter, interest

may then run until the principal amount is reached again. In Talpe Gamagey Don Carolis

De Silva Appuhami v. Baffamagey Don Theodoris [ibid.] Clarence A.C.J. held that this

was indeed the practice in the country.

How does section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance affect that position in Roman-Dutch law?

Is that part of the Roman-Dutch law still valid in Sri Lanka after Section 5 was enacted? I

need not address that question here as there is no evidence in this case that the amount

Page 11 of 15

of interest to be paid by the Appellants to the Respondent reached the principal

amount. It is a matter to be considered in appropriate proceedings when the issue

arises.

The ambit of Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance was considered in Fernando and

Another v. Sillappen & Others [5 C.W.R. 301] which was decided in 1918, where

Bertram C.J. explained the meaning of the words the amount recoverable on account of

interest. He did so after interpreting Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code to provide

for the adjustment of three sums, firstly, the principal sum, secondly, the interest on the

principal sum up to the date of action, and in the third place, a supplementary sum in

respect of interest from the date of action brought to the date of judgment.

In so far as the interest is concerned, Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code allows the

Court to award interest on the principal sum at the rate agreed between parties firstly,

for any period prior to the institution of the action, and secondly, from the date of action

to the date of the decree. Furthermore, the Court is competent to grant interest on the

total amount decided upon from the date of the decree to the date of payment.

Bertram C.J. [ibid., page 303] took the view that the words the amount recoverable on

account of interest in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance did not apply to the

aggregate amount made up of the two sums of interest, i.e., firstly, the interest due up

to the date of action brought, and secondly, the interest due from the date of action

brought to the date of judgment.

In other words, the prohibition in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance applies only to the

amount of interest due on the principal sum as at the date of the institution of the

action.

This prohibition does not apply to the power vested in Court in terms of Section 192 of

the Civil Procedure Code to award interest on the principal sum according to the rate

Page 12 of 15

agreed between parties from the date of action to the date of decree and on the

aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment or such

earlier date determined by Court.

Bertram C.J. [ibid.] held that Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code intended to give

the creditor a certain additional statutory right to interest in addition to the limit of

interest which he was allowed by the common law. The principle of this additional

statutory right is that the creditors rights ought not to be prejudiced by the length of

the resistance offered to his claim by the debtor.

In Lucia Perera v. Albert Fernando [supra.] decided in 1931, it was held that Section 192

of the Civil Procedure Code does not in anyway repeal the provision in Section 3 (present

Section 5) of the Civil Law Ordinance and that it must be read subject to that. The

decision in Fernando and Another v. Sillappen & Others [supra.] was not discussed.

Weeramantry in The Law of Contracts [supra., page 932] states:

Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code does, however confer on creditors an

additional right in this sense, that interest may be claimed for the period between

the plaint and judgment even in cases where the interest claimed in the plaint

already equals the amount of the principal. The date of plaint is thus the time at

which the line is drawn in calculating the limit of interest allowed under the Civil

Law Ordinance, the underlying principle being that the creditors rights ought not

be prejudiced by the length of resistance offered in Court by the debtor.

In my view, this proposition has much merit given that the Civil Procedure Code was

enacted in 1889 whereas the Civil Law Ordinance was enacted in 1852.

Moreover, this assertion is of greater significance in the current context where laws

delays have had a negative impact on the administration of justice. To apply the principle

in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance to the additional right conferred on creditors

Page 13 of 15

terms in Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code will embolden the debtors to prolong

litigation with the assistance of canny legal advice. The creditor may, at the end of a

prolonged litigation, be left with a worthless paper decree.

In Nimalaratne Perera v. Peoples Bank [(2005) 2 Sri.L.R. 67] it was held that the

limitation placed by Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance on the amount recoverable as

interest has no application to interest recoverable relating to a banking transaction. The

Respondent is not a bank. The transaction in question is not a banking transaction.

Hence, we are not called upon to test the validity of the ratio in Nimalaratne Perera v.

Peoples Bank [ibid.].

It is pertinent to note that the rule in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance has been

referenced in some recent legislation by the legislature. On one occasion it is repeated,

and on another occasion an exception has been made.

Section 5 of the Money Lending Ordinance No. 2 of 1918 as amended, states that in

taking account under Section 2 therein, the court shall observe the rule that no interest

shall at any time be recoverable to an amount in excess of the sum then due as principal.

In terms of Section 21 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 as

amended, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in that Act or any other law, an

institution may recover as interest in an action instituted under this Act, a sum of

money in excess of the sum of money calculated as principal, in such action. (emphasis

added)

However, the Respondent does not benefit from this exception as this action has not

been instituted under that Act.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the rule in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance

is part of our law. It prevents the recovery on account of interest a sum exceeding the

principal as at the date of the institution of the action even where interest has been paid

Page 14 of 15

from time to time provided that the interest so paid has not reached the principal sum.

However, the rule in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance does not apply to the interest

that the Court can order in terms of Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code on the

principal sum and interest thereon from the date of the action to the date of the decree

and on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of

payment or such earlier date determined by Court.

The learned Commercial High Court Judge awarded the Respondent a sum of Rs.

12,433,028/= and interest of 21% per annum on a sum of Rs. 12,420,540/= from

25.11.2006 to the date of payment. This is contrary to the rule set out in Section 5 of the

Civil Law Ordinance.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the Respondent is only entitled to the following relief:

(1) The balance of the principal sum of Rs. 2,841,384/= (Rs. 3,000,000/= less

payment received as at termination Rs. 158,616/=);

(2) Interest on Rs. 3,000,000/= at the rate of 21% per annum agreed between the

parties from 07.01.2006 (the date of the Mortgage Bond No. 486) up to

24.07.2007 (the date of institution of this action). If the total amount of interest

exceeds Rs. 3,000,000/=, the Respondent is only entitled to Rs. 3,000,000/= in

view of Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance;

(3) From the date of institution of this action to the date of the decree, the

Respondent is entitled, in terms of Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code, to

interest on the principal sum of Rs. 3,000,000/= at the agreed rate of 21% per

annum;

(4) For the aggregate amount, namely the interest recoverable under item (2) and (3)

above, an interest at the rate of 13% from the date of judgment till the date on

which the entire amount is paid.

The rule in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance will not apply to items (3) and (4).

Page 15 of 15

The above calculation is based on the statement of accounts marked X9 which was not

challenged during the evidence of the 1st Appellant.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the learned Commercial High Court Judge is

varied to the extent set out above. The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court is

directed to enter a decree accordingly.

Appeal partly allowed. I make no order as to costs.
