This Judgement relates to an Application filed in terms of Articles 17 and 126 of the

Constitution by the 1st to 42nd Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners)

seeking relief in respect of an alleged infringement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under and in terms of Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution by one or

more of the Respondents to this Application.

The 1st Respondent is the Director General of the Department of Irrigation, the 2nd

Respondent is the Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources

Management, and the 3rd Respondent is the Attorney General who has been made a

Respondent in compliance with the Constitution.

This matter was supported before this Court on 12th February 2018, and leave was

granted under Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

In S.C. (F/R) No. 157/17 Counsel for the Petitioners made an application on 24th May

2017 and the Court was informed that S.C. (F/R) No. 157/17 was connected with the

instant case, S.C. (F/R) No. 166/17. The Court listed both matters for support with S.C

(F/R) Nos. 155/17, 156/17, 158/17 and 159/17. Leave was granted under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution on 10th October 2017.

In S.C (F/R) No. 12/17, Counsel for the Petitioners made an application on 22nd May

2018 and informed the Court that the circumstances of this matter are the same as in

S.C. (F/R) 166/17 Counsel for the Petitioner moved to re-fix this matter with S.C. (F/R)

166/17 for Argument on 21st September 2018, and leave was granted under Article

12(1) of the Constitution on 15th March 2017.

I find it pertinent to refer to the factual matrix of this application as provided by the

parties in order to ascertain whether the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Articles 12(1), 12(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated by the

1st to 3rd Respondents.

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 40 of 57

Facts of the case as per the Petitioners

The Petitioners state that they were recruited to the Department of Irrigation

(hereinafter referred to as the Department) as Casual Employees between 1st

January 2000 and 3rd March 2014 to the roles of either Technical Officer, Management

Assistant and or Primary Grade Unskilled worker.

Thereafter, the Petitioners state that they received appointment letters from the 1st

Respondent (marked P5(1) to P5(42)) stating that the Petitioners were appointed

to permanent posts with effect from 24th October 2014 in accordance with the Public

Administration Circular 25/2014 (hereinafter referred to as P.A.C. 25/2014 and

marked P4). The Petitioners state that the letters of appointment indicated that the

afore-stated appointments to permanent posts were subject to a three-year

probationary period, following which, if the work is found to be satisfactory, the

Petitioners would be issued confirmation letters. The Petitioners state that, up to date,

the Petitioners have received no complaints pertaining to unsatisfactory work and, as

a result, harboured the legitimate expectation that they would be confirmed in their

appointments following the conclusion of three-year probationary period.

According to the Petitioners, however, those who were appointed to the posts of

Technical Assistant and Management Assistant received letters on or about 18th

August 2015 (marked P6(1) to P6(8)), which cancelled the previous letters of

appointment to permanent posts and instead stated that the aforementioned

Petitioners were re-appointed to posts of Primary Grade Unskilled worker.

The Petitioners state that, despite this, the aforementioned Petitioners continued to

carry out the functions of a Technical Assistant and Management Assistant; the

Petitioners further state that they were treated similarly vis--vis a permanent

employee and experienced similar salary deductions.

Thereafter, the Petitioners state that they received a letter on or about 20th June 2016

(marked P8(1) to P8(28)) stating that an Audit had commenced, and as per the

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 41 of 57

Audit, there were observations of instances wherein the minimum requirements and

qualification of an employee under the P.A.C. 25/2014 were not fulfilled. Subsequently,

the Petitioners state that the same letter further revealed that they shall be removed

from employment as the Petitioners did not fulfil the aforementioned minimum

qualifications stipulated in the P.A.C. 25/2014.

The Petitioners state that the 1st Respondent did not communicate information

regarding the individual(s) responsible for conducting the Audit, and neither were the

Petitioners, at any point in time, summoned, questioned or inquired from to ascertain

their compliance with the minimum qualifications. The Petitioners maintain that they

fulfilled all requirements set forth in the P.A.C. 25/2014. The Petitioners state that,

instead, the Audit was the commencement of an organized attempt of political

revenge by the Respondents to remove the Petitioners from Public Service posts

appointed to them by the previous government.

The Petitioners further state that, notwithstanding the aforesaid letters informing the

Petitioners of the commencement of the Audit, the Petitioners continued to work as

permanent employees for more than two years; according to the Petitioners, this was

until the Petitioners received letters signed by the 1st Respondent between 7th April

2017 and 21st April 2017 (marked P9(1) to P9(42)) stating that the Petitioners

appointments have been cancelled and/or the Petitioners have been removed from

employment in light of the discovery made as a result of the Audit, stating that the

Petitioners had failed to continuously work for 180 days as set forth in the P.A.C.

25/2014. According to the Petitioners, this same letter further claimed that any

advancements of money and loans obtained from the government should be paid on

or before 2nd May 2017.

The Petitioners believe that the word continuous, in the context of the P.A.C. 25/2014,

has been erroneously misinterpreted by the 1st Respondent to mean every day. The

Petitioners base this belief on the following reasons: (a) the objective of enacting the

P.A.C. 25/2014 was to grant employment for those who were recruited and are still in

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 42 of 57

the service on Temporary Casual (daily wages), Substitute, Contract or Relief basis; (b)

it is impossible for any of the employees in the above categories to work every day

as none of them are permanent employees and are not assigned work every day; (c) it

is impossible and impracticable to work every day as every day may include

Saturdays, Sundays, as well as public holidays, and as no employee is immune from

illnesses, it is impossible to expect that any person could work every day for 180 days;

(d) if the word continuous is interpreted to mean every day it shall not give any

substance to the objectives of the P.A.C. 25/2014, and the process of enacting the

P.A.C. 25/2014 will be rendered nugatory; and (e) if the government wanted the P.A.C.

25/2014 to confine to employees who have worked every day the government would

have expressed so, but the Cabinet deliberately used the word continuous knowing

that employees in the categories specified are not assigned work every day.

The interpretation employed by the Petitioners of the use of the word continuous is

to mean six months; hence, the Petitioners state that an employee must be eligible

under the P.A.C. 25/2014 if the said employee has worked continuously for six months.

The Petitioners further state that, even if the use of continuous is interpreted to mean

a total of 180 days from the date of recruitment to 24th October 2014, the Petitioners

would still satisfy this requirement.

Additionally, the Petitioners state that, to the best of their knowledge, the

aforementioned interpretation of the use of continuous employed by the Petitioners

was adopted at the time of the Petitioners appointments as permanent employees.

Moreover, the Petitioners state that, on or about 4th April 2016, the Cabinet adopted

the Public Administration Circular 25/14 (II) (hereinafter referred to as the P.A.C. 25/14

(II) and marked P12), which cancelled the previously issued P.A.C. 25/14. The

Petitioners state that, in doing so, the Cabinet expressly communicated that the P.A.C.

25/14 was being cancelled without prejudice to any permanent appointments made

according to the P.A.C. 25/14. In support of the Petitioners interpretation of the use

of continuous in the context of the P.A.C. 25/14, the Petitioners state that: (a) when

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 43 of 57

adopting P.A.C. 25/14 (II) the Cabinet would have been fully aware of the interpretation

given to the use of continuous in the previously issued P.A.C. 25/14 and, therefore,

knowingly, intentionally and deliberately communicated that no appointment made in

accordance with the P.A.C. 25/14 was to be affected by its cancellation which confirms

that the Petitioners interpretation of the use of continuous was the policy adopted

by the government; (b) subsequently, a change in the interpretation of the use of

continuous amounts to a change in policy as it is a broad concept affecting the

livelihood of several Public Officers; (c) as per Article 55 of the Constitution, only the

Cabinet has the power to change or make policy in respect of appointments,

promotions, transfers, disciplinary and dismissal of Public Officers; and (d) even if the

interpretation of the use of continuous adopted by the Petitioners is considered

erroneous, it is the Cabinet of Ministers, and not the 1st Respondent, that reserves the

power under the law to make decisions and/or interpretations to the P.A.C. 25/14 and

P.A.C. 25/14 (II) in respect of policy pertaining to appointments, promotions, transfers,

disciplinary control and dismissal of Public Officers.

The Petitioners state that, consequently, the removal from employment of the

Petitioners in the absence of a hearing and the erroneous interpretation of the P.A.C.

25/14 employed by the 1st Respondent are unjust, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and

in violation of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In

the foregoing circumstances, the Petitioners claim that the Petitioners Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under Articles 12 (1), 12 (2), and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution have

been infringed and/or are being continuously infringed by the aforesaid executive and

administrative action. Hence, the Petitioner prays for an order to quash the decision to

remove the Petitioners from employment.

Facts of the case as per the Respondents

As per the 1st Respondent, the Petitioners were not recruited on a casual or contract

basis but instead as Labourers on an ad hoc/Thaduchitha () basis. Persons

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 44 of 57

recruited under the afore-stated category were to be paid only for the days on which

they worked, were free to work elsewhere simultaneously on the days they did not

work for the Department and were not entitled to leave nor maternal benefits.

The 1st Respondent states that, as per the P.A.C. 25/14, only the persons who were

recruited on a temporary, casual (on a daily wage), substitute, contract or relief basis

were eligible to be granted permanent employment, and that too only if the said

persons, inter alia, (a) had worked for a continuous period of 180 days as of 24th

October 2014 as per paragraph 02 of the P.A.C 25/2014; and (b) had possessed the

relevant educational qualifications stipulated by the P.A.C. 25/14 as per paragraph 03

of the same. Accordingly, any persons who had not worked for a continuous period of

180 days as of 24th October 2014 or had not possessed the relevant educational

qualifications stipulated in the P.A.C. 25/14 will not have a right to permanent

employment nor be deemed to be eligible to claim permanent employment under the

P.A.C. 25/14.

Moreover, the 1st Respondent states that, as per paragraph 04 of the P.A.C. 25/14, the

eligible person(s) ought to be made permanent in the post to which they were initially

recruited and not to the post they were serving or in relation to the functions they

discharged.

The 1st Respondent further states that, as per the Gazette Notification No. 1733/52

dated 25th November 2011, the powers to make appointments to the posts relevant

to this case have been devolved to the Department by the Public Service Commission,

and it is the Departments duty to ensure that permanent appointments made under

the P.A.C. 25/14 are compliant with the provisions thereof.

The 1st Respondent states that the Petitioners who were recruited as Labourers on

the aforementioned ad hoc/Thaduchitha () basis were issued letters of

appointment (marked P5(1) to P5(42)) in respect of the posts of Labourer, Clerk,

Technical Assistant, etc.

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 45 of 57

The 1st Respondent states that, however, the Department was informed by the

Department of Management Services by means of a letter dated 18th March 2015

marked R1 that a number of these appointments, i.e. P5(12), P5(18), P5(21),

P5(30), P5(32), P5(33), P5(41) and P10(42), appeared to have been made on the

basis of the functions they performed, which was contrary to the provisions of

paragraph 04 of the P.A.C. 25/14. The 1st Respondent states that, accordingly, the

abovementioned eight Petitioners were issued fresh letters of appointment dated 18th

August 2015 (marked P6(1) to P6(8)) appointing the Petitioners to the posts of

Labourer. The 1st Respondent states that the Petitioners accepted the

abovementioned appointments and did not take any legal steps to question the same

at the relevant time. Hence, the 1st Respondent maintains that the Petitioners had

acquiesced to the act of being appointed as Labourers and, as a result, are estopped

from complaining about the same.

The 1st Respondent states that, following confusion as to the calculation of the

requirement set forth by paragraph 04 of the P.A.C. 25/14 wherein only the persons

who had worked satisfactorily for a continuous period of 180 days as of 24th October

2014 would be eligible, a clarification was sought from, and a response thereto was

issued by the Ministry of Public Administration and Management to the Ministry of

Irrigation and Water Resource Management by means of a letter dated 9th May 2016

(marked as R2, R2(a) and R2(b)). The 1st Respondent states that this clarification

set forth the interpretation of the said 180 days to mean 180 working days, excluding

public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays. As such, the 1st Respondent maintains that the

interpretation given in R2 is consistent with the provisions of paragraph 02 of the

P.A.C. 25/14, that the various interpretations of the word continuous employed by

the Petitioners are erroneous and misleading, and further that the Ministry of Public

Administration and Management has informed the Ministry of Irrigation and Water

Resource Management by means of a letter dated 2nd October 2015 (marked R3)

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 46 of 57

that if the Department wished to act in excess of the provisions in the P.A.C. 25/14, it

should be done after receiving a policy decision in respect of the same.

The 1st Respondent states that the Petitioners who served on the ad hoc/Thaduchitha

() basis were not eligible to be considered under the P.A.C. 25/14 as the said ad

hoc/Thaduchitha () basis was not recognized by the P.A.C. 25/14. The 1st

Respondent states that, even if the Petitioners were serving as casual employees and

were, therefore, eligible to be considered under the P.A.C. 25/14, the Petitioners would

be compelled to establish inter alia that: (a) the Petitioners had worked satisfactorily

for 180 days continuously as per paragraph 02 of P.A.C. 25/14, and (b) the Petitioners

possessed the relevant educational qualifications as per paragraph 03 of the P.A.C.

25/14.

The 1st Respondent states that an internal Investigation Report (marked R4) in

respect of the appointments made under the P.A.C. 25/14 by the Department revealed

that the Petitioners had not worked a continuous period of 180 days as required by

paragraph 02 of the P.A.C. 25/14 but had yet been granted permanent appointments

under the P.A.C. 25/14.

The 1st Respondent states that, in light of the aforementioned circumstances, the

Department was compelled to cancel the permanent appointments previously issued

to the Petitioners by means of letters dated 31st March 2017 (marked P9(1) to

P9(42)).

The 1st Respondent further states that the Petitioners have failed to submit proof of

the Petitioners compliance with the relevant educational qualifications stipulated in

paragraph 03 of the P.A.C. 25/14.

As such, the 1st Respondent maintains that: (a) the cancellation of the Petitioners

appointments was reasonable, in good faith and legal, and not politically motivated;

(b) the Petitioners have failed to adduce any evidence to suggest that the cancellation

of the Petitioners appointments was politically motivated; and (c) in view of the

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 47 of 57

aforementioned facts, if the Petitioners appointments were not cancelled, then it

might appear that the Respondents have acted in violation of the provisions of the

P.A.C. 25/14.

The 1st Respondent submits the following preliminary objections: (a) the Petitioners

are attempting to obtain a relief they cannot obtain directly; (b) the Petitioners have

suppressed and/or misrepresented material facts from/to this Court; (c) the Petitioners

have failed to come before this Court with clean hands and/or the Petitioners are in

breach of the doctrine of uberima fides; and (d) the Petition is filed after the expiry of

the one months time set out in Article 126(2) of the Constitution. The 1st Respondent,

therefore, prays to dismiss the Petition.

The Preliminary Objections will be addressed within the body of the analysis.

Legal Analysis

Article 12(1) of the Constitution

The specific question before this Court is whether the decision of the 1st Respondent

to remove the Petitioners from permanent employment is violative of the equality

postulated by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The two well-known legal expressions that are interrelated to the concept of equality

are found in Article 12(1) of the Constitution, and it provides as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

Thus, Article 12(1) of the Constitution confers a positive obligation on the State to

ensure that every individual is entitled to equal treatment and equal protection

guaranteed by the law, regardless of their status in a given circumstance. In this

context, it is the duty of the Department of Irrigation to ensure that the permanent

appointments are made in line with the P.A.C. 25/14 and its provisions thereof.

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 48 of 57

In the instant case, the Petitioners who were recruited to the said Department on an

ad-hoc /Thaduchitha () basis were later appointed as permanent employees in

accordance with the P.A.C. 25/14 through appointment letters from the 1st Respondent

effecting from 24/10/2014 (as provided in documents marked P5(1) to P5(42)).

Thereafter, as per the letters (marked P9(1) to P9(42)) received by the Petitioners,

it is evident that the Petitioners had been removed from permanent employment on

the basis that they had not continuously worked for a period of 180 days as required

by the P.A.C. 25/14.

Accordingly, the grievance of the Petitioners is that the removal from employment of

the Petitioners in the absence of a hearing and the erroneous interpretation of the

P.A.C. 25/14 employed by the 1st Respondent are unjust, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious

and in violation of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

However, in order to determine whether the 1st Respondent violated the Petitioners

Fundamental Rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, firstly, it is necessary to

examine the eligibility of the Petitioners to be considered under the P.A.C. 25/14 for

permanent employment and secondly, the reasonableness of the conduct of the 1st

Respondent.

The P.A.C. 25/14 granted permanent employment to those in the mentioned

categories who had completed 180 days of continuous satisfactory service as of 24th

October 2014 and who possess educational qualifications to have at least passed

Grade 8/Year 9. The Petitioners were recruited as Labourers on ad hoc/Thaduchitha

() basis, and the said ad hoc /Thaduchitha () basis was not recognized under

the P.A.C. 25/14. In these circumstances, could the challenge based on Article 12(1)

succeed? It is apparent from the foregoing circumstances that the Petitioners are not

eligible to be considered under the P.A.C. 25/14 for permanent employment and thus

have no right to claim permanent employment. The Petitioner cannot claim a right to

which he is not entitled, and allowing such would be unlawful and indeed negate the

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 49 of 57

advancement of equal protection of law principle enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution.

G. P. A. de Silva J, in Jayasekara V. Wipulasena and Others [1988] 2 Sri LR 237,

stated as follows:

Article 12(1) cannot confer on the petitioner a right to which he is not

entitled in terms of the very contract upon which he found his complaint

of "unequal treatment".

In K. J. A Chathumi Sehasa and Another v. S. Irani Pathiranawasam, Principal,

Southlands Balika Vidyalaya and 7 Others [2018] S.C. [FR] Application No.

201/2017(SC Minutes dated 30. 05. 2018), Aluwihare PC, J. observed as follows:

For the complaint of an unequal treatment of law to succeed the

petitioner must show that the unequal treatment was meted out in the

performance of a lawful act. It is a cardinal principle that equal treatment

should be referable to the exercise of a valid right, founded in law in

contradistinction to an illegal right which is illegal in law.

Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in the case of Farook Vs Dharmaratne, Chairman,

Provincial Public Service Commission, Uva and others (2005) I Sri L. R. 133

observed as follows:

When a person does not possess the required qualifications that is

necessary for a particular position, would it be possible for him to obtain

relief in terms of a violation of his Fundamental Rights on the basis of

unequal treatment? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, it

would mean that Article 12(1) of the Constitution would be applicable even

in a situation where there is no violation of the applicable legal procedure

or the general practice. The application of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

cannot be used for such situations as it provides to an aggrieved person

only for the equal protection of the law where the authorities have acted

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 50 of 57

illegally or incorrectly without giving due consideration to the applicable

guidelines. Article 12(1) of the Constitution does not provide for any

situation where the authorities will have to act illegally. The safeguard

retained in Article 12(1) is for the performance of a lawful act and not to

be directed to carry out an illegal function. In order to succeed the

petitioner must be in a position to place material before this Court that

there has been unequal treatment within the framework of a lawful act.

The Petitioners have also maintained that they were of the legitimate expectation that

they would be confirmed in their appointments as there were no complaints against

them that their work was unsatisfactory.

Prof. Endicott of the University of Oxford [Administrative Law 2nd ed. at p. 283] has

commented that a legitimate expectation,

Might be better called a legally protected expectation.

In the case of India vs. Hindustan Development Corporation (1993) 3 SSC 499 it

was stated as follows:

"However earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and

however confidently one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by

themselves cannot amount to an assertable expectation and a mere

disappointment does not attract legal consequences. A pious hope cannot

amount to a legitimate expectation. The legitimacy of an expectation can

be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an

established procedure followed in a natural and regular sequence. Again,

it is distinguishable from a mere expectation. Such expectation should be

justifiable, legitimate and protectable. Every such legitimate expectation

does not by itself fructify into a right and, therefore, it does not amount to

a right in a conventional sense."

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 51 of 57

When considering whether the Petitioners can base their application on legitimate

expectation, this Court has already held that the Petitioners are not eligible under the

P.A.C. 25/14 to be considered for permanent employment. Further, in the instant case,

the Petitioners neither satisfy the minimum educational qualifications nor fulfil the

requirement of satisfactorily working continuously for 180 days as required by the

P.A.C. 25/14. Therefore, there is no legitimate expectation to be frustrated by the 1st

Respondent.

With regard to the reasonableness of the conduct of the 1st Respondent in the instant

case, although the Petitioners had been wrongly appointed as permanent employees

through appointment letters (marked P5(1) to P5(42)) effecting from 24th October

2014, the 1st Respondent had rectified the above by issuing fresh letters of

appointment (marked P6(1) to P6(8)) dated 18th August 2015 which comply with

the provisions of the P.A.C. 25/14. As the 1st Respondent had taken action to rectify

the previously issued letters of appointment to comply with the provisions of the P.A.C.

25/14, I am of the view that the conduct of the 1st Respondent is reasonable.

The Petitioners have also alleged that Petitioners were not provided with an

opportunity to establish whether they satisfied the minimum qualifications required

by the P.A.C. 25/14. As it has already been established that the Petitioners are not

eligible to be considered for permanent employment under the P.A.C. 25/14, this Court

can see no justification as to why the Petitioners should be afforded an opportunity

for a hearing.

Furthermore, the allegation of the Petitioners that the 1st Respondent had erroneously

interpreted the word continuous is dismissed by reason of the clarification sought

from and the response thereto issued by the Ministry of Public Administration and

Management to the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resource Management which

prescribed that the interpretation of the use of continuous was to mean 180 working

days excluding public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays. The 1st Respondent had acted

accordingly and in compliance with the aforementioned interpretation.

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 52 of 57

It must also be noted that the Petitioners accepted the appointment letters marked

P6(1) to P6(8) dated 18/08/2015 without raising any objection and did not seek any

relief from the Court at the time they received the above letters. And if the Petitioners

are eligible under the Circular, they should have revealed all the details affirming the

same. The absence of the above explanations show that the Petitioners were aware

that they had no legal basis to challenge the above and thus, the Petitioners cannot

now complain that their Fundamental Rights have been violated by the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner had sought relief from the Court to quash the decision taken by the 1st

Respondent to terminate the Petitioners services and/or cancel the appointments, as

well as claim advancements of money and loans obtained from the Government to be

paid on or before 2nd May 2017. It must be borne in mind that the Petitioners cannot

seek this Court to compel the Respondents to act illegally or against the law. The relief

sought by the Petitioner is one that this Court, as a Court of Law and Equity, cannot

provide since,

"Illegality and equity are not on speaking terms."

Therefore, this Court declares that the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have not been infringed by the Respondents in

this instant case.

Article 12(2) of the Constitution

While Article 12(1) of the Constitution outlines the positive obligation of the State,

Article 12(2) of the same sets out the negative obligation of the State to ensure that,

No citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion,

language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any one of such

grounds.

The Petitioners allege that the Petitioners removal from employment is an organised

attempt at political revenge since the appointments were made permanent by the

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 53 of 57

previous government. In the instant case, the Petitioners are attempting to insinuate

that the Petitioners were discriminated against based on the grounds of political

opinion. However, this allegation is insufficient, especially in the absence of any

material evidence illustrating the Petitioners association with the previous

government, in establishing that the Petitioners removal from employment by the 1st

Respondent infringes the Fundamental Rights secured by Article 12(2) of the

Constitution. In actuality, the decision of the 1st Respondent in removing the

Petitioners from employment is evidently in accordance with the provisions prescribed

by the P.A.C. 25/14.

In these circumstances, this Court declares that the Petitioners Fundamental Tights

under Article 12(2) of the Constitution have not been violated in the instant case.

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution

This Court shall now deal with the Petitioners complaint of a violation of Article

14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution states as follows:

Every citizen is entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in

association with others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade,

business or enterprise.

It must be noted that this is not an absolute right. It is subjected to Article 15(5), 15(7)

and 15(8):

15(5) The exercise and operation of the fundamental right declared and

recognized by Article 14(1)(g) shall be subject to such restrictions as may

be prescribed by law in the interests of national economy or in relation to

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 54 of 57

(a) the professional, technical, academic, financial and other qualifications

necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation,

trade, business or enterprise and the licensing and disciplinary control of

the person entitled to such fundamental right; and

(b) the carrying on by the State, a State agency or a public corporation of

any trade, business, industry, service or enterprise whether to the exclusion,

complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise.

15(7) The exercise and operation of all the Fundamental Rights declared

and recognized by Articles 12, 13(1), 13(2) and 14 shall be subject to such

restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the interests of national

security, public order and the protection of public health or morality, or for

the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and

freedoms of others, or of meeting the just requirements of the general

welfare of a democratic society. For the purposes of this paragraph law

includes regulations made under the law for the time being relating to

public security.

15(8) The exercise and operation of the Fundamental Rights declared and

recognized by Articles 12(1), 13 and 14 shall, in their application to the

members of the Armed Forces, Police Force and other Forces charged with

the maintenance of public order, be subject to such restrictions as may be

prescribed by law in the interests of the proper discharge of their duties

and the maintenance of discipline among them.

Further, Article 28(c) of the Constitution lays down the following duty:

(28) The exercise and enjoyment of rights and freedoms are inseparable

from the performance of duties and obligations and accordingly it is the

duty of every person in Sri Lanka

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 55 of 57

(c) to work conscientiously in his chosen occupation.

Justice A.R.B. Amerasinghe in W.M.K. De Silva v. Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer

Corporation S.C. Application No.7/88 [1988] 2 Sri L.R. 393 observed as

follows:

In an application for relief under Article 14(1)(g), the Petitioner must also

show that her right to engage in any lawful occupation, profession, trade,

business or enterprise was, unreasonably obstructed. The Petitioner must

go further still and establish that the right claimed was (a) a legal right and

that (b) it is a fundamental right.

He further added that:

Article 14(1)(g), recognizes the right of every citizen to use his powers of

body and mind in any lawful calling: to pursue any livelihood and

avocation. It confers no obligation to give any particular kind of work or

indeed any right to be continued in employment at all.

It would thus be seen that Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution confers on citizens of Sri

Lanka the fundamental right to do work of any particular kind and of their choice. It

does not, however, confer the right to hold a particular job or to occupy a particular

post of ones choice.

The equivalent to Article 14(1)(g) of our Constitution is Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian

Constitution, which states:

All citizens shall have the right to practice any profession, or to carry on

any occupation, trade or business.

In Fertilizer Corporation v. Union of India (1981) AIR 344, 1981 SCR (2) 52, the

Court held that Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution does not protect the right to

work in a particular post under a contract or employment, and as such Article 19(1)(g)

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 56 of 57

of the Indian Constitution cannot be invoked against the loss of a job or removal from

service.

A similar view was taken in Elmore Perera v. Major Montague Jayawickrema,

Minister of Public Administration and Plantation Industries [1985]

S.C./Application No. 134/84, where Chief Justice Sharvananda stated as follows:

Article 14(1)(g) recognises a general right in every citizen to do work of a

particular kind and of his choice. It does not confer the right to hold a

particular job or to occupy a particular post of ones choice. The

compulsory retirement complained of, may, at the highest affect his

particular employment, but it does not affect his right to work as a

Surveyor.

In the instant case, the Petitioners have failed to establish that their right to engage in

any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise was unreasonably

obstructed by the Respondents. As this Court exhibited the view that the Petitioners

are not eligible to be considered for permanent employment under the P.A.C. 25/14,

the Petitioners have further failed to establish that the claimed right was a legal right.

Correspondingly, this Court observes that the removal of employment of the

Petitioners affects the Petitioners particular status of employment but does not affect

their right to work as Labourers.

Hence, I am of the view that the Respondents have not infringed the Petitioners

Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Time Bar

The Counsel for the Respondent took up a preliminary objection that the Petition has

not been filed within the time frame stipulated in terms of Article 126(2) of the

Constitution. As this Court observed, the impugned letters of termination were issued

on 31st March 2017 and received by the Petitioners on 7th April 2017. Thereafter, the

Petitioners filed the application for the instant case on 5th May 2017. It must be noted

S.C. (F/R) No.166/2017 and 6 others JUDGEMENT Page 57 of 57

that the one-month time period prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution does

not commence from the date the right was violated upon, but instead commences

from the date when either party is made aware of this violation or when one can

feasibly take steps to come before this Court. Therefore, based on the facts and

circumstances of this case, this Court takes the view that the application of the

Petitioners in the instant case is not barred by time and accordingly, the preliminary

objection raised by the Respondent is dismissed.

Decision

In view of the foregoing circumstances and reasons, I hold that the decisions and

conduct of the 1st Respondent have not infringed the Fundamental Rights guaranteed

by Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss

this application.

Application Dismissed.
