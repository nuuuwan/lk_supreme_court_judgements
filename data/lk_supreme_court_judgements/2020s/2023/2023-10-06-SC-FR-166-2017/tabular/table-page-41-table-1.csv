"qualification of an employee under the P.A.C. 25/2014 were not fulfilled. Subsequently,"
"the Petitioners state that the same letter further revealed that they shall be removed"
"from  employment  as  the  Petitioners  did  not  fulfil  the  aforementioned  minimum"
"qualifications stipulated in the P.A.C. 25/2014."
"The  Petitioners  state  that  the  1st  Respondent  did  not  communicate
