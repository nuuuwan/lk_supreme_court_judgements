"adopting P.A.C. 25/14 (II) the Cabinet would have been fully aware of the interpretation"
"given to the use of “continuous” in the previously issued P.A.C. 25/14 and, therefore,"
"knowingly, intentionally and deliberately communicated that no appointment made in"
"accordance with the P.A.C. 25/14 was to be affected by its cancellation which confirms"
"that the Petitioners’ interpretation of the use of “continuous” was the policy adopted"
"by  the  government;  (b)  subsequently,  a  change  in  the  interpretation  of  the  use  of"
"“continuous”  amounts  to  a  change  in  policy  as  it  is  a  broad  concept  affecting  the"
"livelihood of several Public Officers; (c) as per Article 55 of the Constitution, only the"
"Cabinet  has  the  power  to  change  or  make  policy 
in  respect  of  appointments,"
"promotions, transfers, disciplinary and dismissal of Public Officers; and (d) even if the"
"interpretation  of  the  use  of  “continuous”  adopted  by  the  Petitioners  is  considered"
"erroneous, it is the Cabinet of Ministers, and not the 1st Respondent, that reserves the"
"power under the law to make decisions and/or interpretations to the P.A.C. 25/14 and"
"P.A.C. 25/14 (II) in respect of policy pertaining to appointments, promotions, transfers,"
"disciplinary control and dismissal of Public Officers."
"The  Petitioners  state  that,  consequently,  the  removal 
from  employment  of  the"
"Petitioners in the absence of a hearing and the erroneous interpretation of the P.A.C."
"25/14 employed by the 1st Respondent are unjust, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and"
"in violation of the Petitioners’ Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In"
"the foregoing circumstances, the Petitioners claim that the Petitioners’ Fundamental"
"Rights guaranteed under Articles 12 (1), 12 (2), and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution have"
"been infringed and/or are being continuously infringed by the aforesaid executive and"
"administrative action. Hence, the Petitioner prays for an order to quash the decision to"
"remove the Petitioners from employment."
