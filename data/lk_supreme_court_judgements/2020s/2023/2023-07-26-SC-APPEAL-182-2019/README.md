JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC. J,

(1) The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Applicant-Appellant) who was employed by the Sri Lanka Ports

Authority, the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent), filed an application (P1) in terms of

Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), in

the Labour Tribunal of Colombo stating inter alia that his services were

terminated unlawfully and unjustifiably by the Respondent.

(2) The Respondent raised a preliminary objection that the said application

cannot be maintained against it as the Applicant-Appellant had failed to

give one-month notice to the Respondent, which the Respondent asserted

was required in terms of Section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act No.

51 of 1979 (as amended) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the SLPA

Act), and moved the Labour Tribunal to dismiss the application.

(3) By order dated 30th June 2014, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

overruled the said preliminary objection and held that Section 54 of the

SLPA Act has no application regarding the Applications made to the Labour

Tribunal, in terms of Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act (P10).

(4) Aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent moved by way of revision to

the High Court, seeking to have the order of the Labour Tribunal set aside.

By order dated 24th February 2016 (P17), the learned High Court Judge set

aside the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, upholding

the preliminary objection of the Respondent, and dismissed the application

filed by the Applicant-Appellant in the Labour Tribunal.

(5) Aggrieved by the said order of the learned High Court Judge, the Applicant-

Appellant moved this Court by way of an application for special leave to

appeal and special leave was granted on a solitary question of law;

Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law, in coming to the conclusion

that Section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act No. 51 of 1979 is a

mandatory provision and should be adhered to, even in the filing of an

4

application in the Labour Tribunal in accordance with the Industrial

Disputes Act?

The Issue

(6) The fundamental issue to be determined in this appeal is whether an

applicant who wishes to invoke the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal, is

bound by the notice requirement stipulated in section 54 of the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority Act.

(7) Section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act stipulates that;

No Action shall be instituted against the Ports Authority for anything done

or purported to have been done in pursuance of this Act-

(a) without giving the Authority at least one months previous notice in

writing of such intended action; or

(b) after twelve months have lapsed from the date of accrual of the cause

of action. [Emphasis added]

The Placement of Section 54 in the SLPA Act

(8) The Applicant-Appellant claimed that the purpose and scope of s. 54 of the

SLPA Act, as evidenced by its heading and placement is limited to tortious

and related damages claims against the SLPA, and has no relevance or

application to employment matters and in particular, applications to Labour

Tribunals in terms of Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act.

(9) The meaning of the words used in any part of a statute must necessarily

depend on the context in which they are placed, whilst being mindful of

the fact that all parts of an enactment must be construed together as

forming one whole.

(10) In deciding the issue at hand, it would be pertinent to consider the well

accepted canons of interpretations of statutes as well as the decisions

handed down by Appellate courts regarding interpretation of provisions of

statutes. As Maxwell points out, Granted that a document which is

presented to it [parliament] as a statute is an authentic expression of the

5

legislative will, the function of a court is to interpret that document

according to the intent of them that made it [Maxwell on Interpretation

of Statutes 12th Edition pg1]

(11) Bindra states that,

so far as possible, that construction must be placed upon words used in

any part of the statute which makes them consistent with remaining

provisions and with the intention of the legislature to be derived from a

consideration of the enactment. The words may be given a wider or more

restricted meaning than they ordinarily bear, if the context requires it. In

construing a particular section of an Act, one must look at the whole Act,

and it is necessary to consider the context in which the section occurs.

[Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition (2017) at page 355] (the emphasis

is mine)

(12) In Ram Narain vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1957 SC 13, the Supreme

Court of India observed that the meaning of words and expressions used

in an Act must take their colour from the context in which they appear

and in the case of Sheikh Gulfan vs. Sanat Kumar Ganguli, AIR 1965 SC

1839, it was said that; Normally, the words used in a statute have to be

construed in their ordinary meaning; but in many cases, judicial approach

finds that the simple device of adopting the ordinary meaning of words

does not meet the ends of a fair and a reasonable construction. Exclusive

reliance on the bare dictionary meaning of words may not necessarily assist

a proper construction of the statutory provision in which the words occur.

Often enough, in interpreting a statutory provision, it becomes necessary

to have regard to the subject-matter of the statute and the object which it

is intended to achieve. That is why in deciding the true scope and effect of

the relevant words in any statutory provision, the context in which the

words occur, the object of the statute in which the provision is included,

and the policy underlying the statute assume relevance and become

material

In Union of India vs. Elphinstone Spg & Wvg Co Ltd (2001) 4 SCC 139, the

Indian Supreme Court expressed the view that,

6

General words of a particular provision of a statute may be given a

restrictive meaning if the context requires it. By context is meant not only

the textual context arising out of the other provisions of the statute, but also

factual context including the mischief to be remedied, and the

circumstances under which the statute was passed. Context refers to the

statute as a whole, the previous state of law, other statutes in pari materia,

the general scope of the statute and the mischief that it was intended to

remedy.

(13) What could be gleaned from the decisions referred to above is that a

provision should not be construed as if it stood in isolation from the rest of

the statute. When a court is called upon to interpret a term of any provision

of a statute, it should not confine its attention to that particular provision.

The court should also consider the other parts of the statute which shed

light on the intention of the Legislature.

(14) Considering this well-settled principle, Section 54 of the SLPA Act should

not, in my view, be interpreted in isolation, but must be looked at in light

of its placement in the Act.

Section 54 is found in PART VI of the SLPA Act under the heading Liability

of the Ports Authority.

The first section under this Part, namely Section 45 reads as follows;

The Ports Authority shall not be liable for any loss, damage or injury caused

to any property or person within the limits of any specified port unless such

loss, damage or injury is caused by the negligence or wrongful or unlawful

act of that Authority or any of its employees or agents acting within the

scope of his employment.

(15) The subsequent sections in this Part set out provisions pertaining to the

limitation of the liability of the Respondent Authority in relation to any loss,

damage or injury caused to any person or property within the limits of any

specified port. It is in this context that Section 54 is placed in the Act.

7

(16) Additionally, Section 52 of the Act states as follows;

This Part shall not affect any liability that may be imposed on the Ports

Authority by any written law relating to compensation to workmen.

[Emphasis mine]

(17) It is also pertinent to note that the Part or in other words the Chapter in

which Section 54 is placed is titled; Liability of the Ports Authority.

According to Bindra; [supra]

The title of a chapter in a statute is not a determining factor regarding the

interpretation of the provisions of a section in the chapter, but the title

certainly throws considerable light upon the meaning of the section, and

where it is not inconsistent with the section, one should presume that the

title correctly described the object of the provisions of the chapter.

(18) Having taken into account the provisions contained in Part VI of the Act,

this chapter, can be said to be dealing with the limitation of the liability of

the Respondent Authority in relation to civil claims for damages for any

loss, injury or damage caused to persons or property. If the intention of the

Legislature was for the notice requirement to encompass and apply to all

forms of litigation [against SLPA] including applications to Labour Tribunals

filed under Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act, then this procedural

pre-requisite ought to have been placed in the General chapter of the Act

instead of Chapter on Liability of the Ports Authority. Part VIII of the Act

begins with the Chapter titled General. This Chapter delineates inter alia

rules and regulations which may be made by the SLPA, and includes a

provision declaring that suit/action does not lie against the SLPA or any of

its members for any bona fide act taken under the Act (S.69), and a

provision that writs cannot be issued against any member of the SLPA in

any action brought against the SLPA (S. 70).

(19) On examination of the provisions of Part VI, as referred to earlier, it is

evident that the applicability of section 54 is confined to actions in relation

to civil claims for damages for any loss, injury or damage caused to persons

or property made against the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Section 52 in

particular highlights that Part VI of the Act was not intended to affect claims

8

made by workmen against the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Accordingly, in

my view, Section 54 of the SLPA Act must be given a restrictive meaning so

as to not affect an application made by a workman to a Labour Tribunal.

Whether the termination of employment is an act done in the pursuance

of the SLPA Act

(20) Counsel on behalf of the Applicant-Appellant further submitted that section

54 of the SLPA Act is limited in scope to acts done or intended to be done in

pursuance of the Act which does not include the termination of services of

workmen.

(21) In order to substantiate this contention, the Courts attention was directed

towards its interpretation of section 307 (1) of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance No. 29 of 1947 (as amended) which stipulates a similar notice

requirement. It was submitted that the provisions contained in section 54

of SLPA Act and section 307 (1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance are

similar and work towards the same objective and therefore must be

interpreted in a similar manner, considering the principle of pari materia.

Section 307 (1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance states as follows;

No action shall be instituted against any Municipal Council, or the Mayor

or any Councillor or any officer of the Council or any person acting under

the direction of the Council or Mayor for anything done or intended to be

done under the provisions of this Ordinance or by any by-law, regulation

or rule made thereunder (emphasis added).

(22) Several judgments pertaining to the interpretation of Section 307 (1) of this

Ordinance have been cited in order to substantiate the abovementioned

contention.

In the case of Liyanage vs. Municipal Council Galle (1994) 3 SLR 216 this

Court held that,

Section 307(1) requires notice of action in respect of anything done or

intended to be done under the provisions of [the] Ordinance. Clearly, it is

9

not in respect of every act or omission that notice is required, for if that

was the legislative intention section 307(1) could have simply provided

that no action shall be instituted against any Municipal Council [etc.]

until the expiration of one month.

It has been held in Perera vs. Municipal Council, Kandy, that the

corresponding section of the old Ordinance- applies to causes of action

accruing from something done or intended to be done under the provisions

of the Ordinance. The entering into forcible possession of anothers land

cannot be done or intended to be done with any propriety under the

Ordinance; at least I hope so.

This was followed in Ferdinandus vs. Municipal Council, Colombo- the

plaintiff (ratepayer) sent a blank cheque to the Municipal Council, with

instructions to fill it for the amount due as rates; the Council inserted an

amount which also included warrant costs. This was held not to be an act

done or purported to be done in pursuance of the provisions of the

Ordinance, but only under the authority of the ratepayer;

if the act does not fall within the express ambit of the section.it can

neither be regarded as having been performed under the provisions of the

Ordinance nor as an act intended to be performed under any such

provision.

(23) In Weerasooriya Arachchi vs. Special Commissioner, Galle Municipality

(1967) 69 NLR 437, this Court held that,

Section 307 (2) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance is not applicable to

a case where the cause of action arose from an act which was done under

section 16 of the Electricity Act and which a Municipal Council has no

power to perform under any of the provision of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance.

(24) The interpretation of Section 307 (1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance

is that a notice is required only with respect to actions taken under that

particular Act and not any other Act. The judgements also recognize that

10

even those actions are subject to exceptions i.e., not all actions under that

Act are subject to the notice requirement (eg; mala fide actions). In light of

the narrow interpretation accorded to the notice requirement provision in

the Municipal Councils Ordinance, it was argued by the learned Presidents

Counsel that a similar interpretation must be rendered to section 54 of the

SLPA Act too.

(25) In order to substantiate this contention, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Applicant-Appellant submitted that the application of section 54 is

restricted to anything done or purported to have been done in pursuance

of this Act. (Emphasis added), and that the Act does not vest the Respondent

Authority with the power to terminate the services of its employees as it is

in fact a term implied by the common law.

(26) It would be appropriate at this stage to briefly discuss an employers right

to terminate employment under common law.

A contract of employment can be terminated in a variety of ways, namely,

a) Termination by the employer on disciplinary grounds and constructive

dismissal.

b) Termination by the employer on non-disciplinary grounds. This has

assumed particular importance in view of the Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971.

c) Termination by operation of law, which includes termination of a

contract due to such factors as frustration of contract and impossibility

of performance.

d) Termination by effluxion of time, e.g., by the arrival of a mutually

agreed date.

Termination by the employee, which may arise due to a variety of

circumstances such as resignation, vacation or abandonment of

employment or repudiation of the contract by the employee.

(The Contract of Employment, S.R. De Silva, Revised Edition-2017)

11

(27) The employers right to terminate the services of an employee has been

recognized as a term implied by common law (Roman Dutch Law). In The

Contract of Employment by S.R. De Silva (2017-Revised Edition), it is

stated that;

In the common law either party was entitled to terminate the contract of

employment in accordance with its provisions without consequences.

In Egalahewa on Labour Law at page 13, it is stated that;

Implied terms may also come from common law, which is the foundation

of contract of employment. Eg. the right of the employer to select the

employee of his choice, to deal with misconduct, right to transfer, right to

be supervised and direct the manner of performance, vacation of post,

frustration, right to terminate the contract etc. subject, however to the

modifications made by the statute law, if any as some of these rights are

modified by statute law. The court may always imply statutory terms as are

reasonably necessary to give effect to the contract even though the parties

have omitted to settle any particular point, before engagement.

(28) In State Distilleries Corporation vs. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 SLR 395, it was

held that;

Under the common law, an employer had an absolute right to terminate

the contract of employment (subject only to an obligation as to notice or

payment in lieu)

(29) In Vasantha Kumara vs. Skyspan Asia (Pvt.) Ltd. (2008) 1 SLR 324, Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. held that,

It is to be noted that although this position would have been correct under

the common law, where either party was entitled to terminate the contract

of employment in accordance with its provisions without any consequential

effect, the introduction of Labour Laws had modified this position.

(30) Under common law, therefore, an employer has a right to terminate the

employment of a workman. On this basis, it was argued on behalf of the

12

Applicant-Appellant that the termination of employment by the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority is not an act done in pursuance of the SLPA Act.

(31) The Respondent, on the other hand argued that the long title of the Act and

section 7(1) of the SLPA Act covers matters relating to workmen/employees

as well.

The Long Title states that; this Act shall apply for matters in relation to the

officers and servants, property, rights, obligations and liabilities of the Port

(Cargo) Corporation and the Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation

and the public officers of, the property held by, and the rights, obligations

and liabilities of, the department of the Port Commissionerand for

connected matters .

It was contended that the objectives of the Respondent Authority spelled

out in the Long Title to the Act cannot be achieved without its

workmen/employees who thus form an integral part of the Authority and

are therefore covered by the Long Title.

Section 7 (1) of the SLPA Act states that the Respondent Authority has the

power to;

(b) employ such officers and servants as may be necessary for carrying

out the work of the Authority;

(e) to make rules in relation to the officers and servants of the Authority,

including their appointment, promotion, remuneration, discipline,

conduct, leave, working times, holidays and the grant of loans and

advances of salary to them;

(f) to make rules and prescribe procedures in respect of the administration

of the affairs of the Authority

It was argued that under sections 7 (1) (e) and (f), the Respondent

Authority has the power to make rules regarding conduct and discipline

and prescribe procedures relating to the administration of affairs to achieve

its objectives and thus it is only logical and pragmatic for the Respondent

Authority to terminate the services of the workmen when carrying out the

foregoing.

13

(32) The learned Additional Solicitor General also submitted that by-laws or

rules of the SLPA provided for termination of its employees and therefore

section 54 encompasses the act of termination of services. Counsel on behalf

of the Applicant-Appellant, however, argued that this contention is baseless

as section 54 only refers to the Act and not to any by-laws, rules or

regulations.

(33) It was pointed out that this is in contrast to section 307 (1) of the Municipal

Councils Ordinance which makes a notice mandatory for all actions

instituted against any Municipal Council, or the Mayor or any Councillor

or any officer of the Council or any person acting under the direction of the

Council or Mayor for anything done or intended to be done under the

provisions of this Ordinance or by any by-law, regulation or rule made

thereunder. (Emphasis added)

(34) The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius enunciates the maxim of

interpretation that the express/specific mention of one item in a list implies

the exclusion of other items. This appears to be, in my view, an instance in

which this maxim should be applied to raise the inference that the express

exclusion of acts done or purported to have been done by any rule,

regulation or by-law made under the SLPA Act, denotes that section 54 only

applies with respect to acts done in pursuance of the Act itself.

(35) Despite the Respondents argument that the SLPA Act refers to workmen

and that the power to terminate the services of workmen is a necessary act

performed under and by virtue of the SLPA Act, there is no specific provision

contained in the Act which relates to termination of employment, apart

from Section 22A, which states as follows,

Where the services of any employee of the Ports Authority are to be

terminated on any ground other than that of misconduct, notice of such

termination shall be given by the Ports Authority to such employee at

least one month before the date of such termination or one month's

14

salary or wages shall be paid to him by such Authority in lieu of such

notice.

(36) This section does not vest the Respondent Authority with any power to

terminate the employment of workmen. It merely stipulates an obligation

that the Respondent Authority has to follow whenever the services of an

employee are terminated on non-disciplinary grounds.

(37) Accordingly, there is nothing in the SLPA Act itself, which authorizes the

Respondent Authority to terminate the services of a workman. Accordingly,

the act of termination of a workman cannot be said to be an act done in

pursuance of this Act. Therefore, the inference that can be drawn is that

section 54 of the SLPA Act does not encompass applications made to Labour

Tribunals by workmen on the termination of their services.

The Definition of Action

(38) It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Applicant-

Appellant that the notice requirement contemplated in Section 54 of the Act

is only in relation to Action filed against the SLPA and that an Application

to the Labour Tribunal is not an Action within the meaning contained in

the Civil Procedure Code but proceedings of sui generis nature.

(39) It was further contended that upon scrutiny of Section 54 of the SLPA Act,

it is abundantly clear, the word Action referred to therein is an action

within the meaning of Sections 5 and 6 of the Civil Procedure Code.

(40) The Applicant-Appellant, in his replication, admitted that he did not give

prior notice under section 54 of the Act, on the ground that the Labour

Tribunal application filed under the Industrial Disputes Act was for relief

or redress and was not an action instituted against the Respondent.

(41) The term Action has not been defined in the SLPA Act.

In Blacks Law Dictionary, 11th Edition, page 37, the term action is

defined as,

15

A civil or criminal judicial proceeding- An action has been defined to be an

ordinary proceeding in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes

another party for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or

prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense. But in some

sense this definition is equally applicable to special proceedings. More

accurately, it is defined to be any judicial proceeding, which if conducted

to a determination, will result in a judgment or decree. The action is said to

terminate at judgment.

Whartons Law Lexicon (14th Ed.) states that, actions are divided into

criminal and civil.

(42) Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) defines Action as a

proceeding for the prevention of redress of a wrong

Section 6 of the CPC states that an action is,

Every application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the

exercise of the courts power or authority, or otherwise to invite its

interference, constitutes an action.

Learned Counsel appearing for the Applicant-Appellant contended that an

application before a Labour Tribunal is a sui generis application, and not

an action. Therefore, Labour Tribunals are not bound by the notice

requirement stipulated in section 54 of the SLPA Act which is for actions

instituted against the Respondent Authority.

(43) It was contended that ex facie, the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) which

defines action only refers to the matters filed under the CPC, and

therefore the CPC has no application to applications filed in a Labour

Tribunal under section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950

(as amended).

(44) It was also contended that Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code which states

that the words and expressions mentioned therewith shall have the

meanings hereby assigned to them, unless there is something in the subject

or context repugnant thereto not only limits the scope of application of the

definitions contained in the CPC but also enunciates the view that no

16

blanket meaning can be attributed to a word and that every term must be

interpreted in light of the context and/or subject.

(45) In light of Section 6 of the CPC which states that an action is an .

application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the exercise

of the courts power or authority, or otherwise to invite its

interference., it was argued that applications before Labour Tribunals

are not actions as Labour Tribunals are not Courts per se.

(46) The distinction between Tribunals and Courts is said to be further evinced

by Article 105 of the Constitution which provides as follows;

105. (1) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the institutions for

the administration of justice which protect, vindicate and enforce the rights

of the People shall be-

(a) the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(b) the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(c) the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and such other Courts of the

First Instance, tribunals or such institutions as Parliament may from time to

time ordain and establish.

(2) All courts, tribunals and institutions created and established by existing

written law for the administration of justice and for the adjudication and

settlement of industrial and other disputes, other than the Supreme Court,

shall be deemed to be courts, tribunals and institutions created and

established by Parliament. Parliament may replace or abolish, or amend the

powers, duties, jurisdiction and procedure of, such courts, tribunals and

institutions. (Emphasis added)

(47) It was submitted that the Constitution itself distinguishes between courts,

tribunals and other institutions created and established by existing written

law for the administration of justice and for the adjudication and settlement

of industrial and other disputes. The contention is that Labour Tribunals are

not courts and therefore an application before a Labour Tribunal is not an

action as per Section 6 of the CPC.

(48) Furthermore, Section 7 of the CPC states that;

17

The procedure of an action may be either regular or summary.

Counsel for the Applicant-Appellant argued that Section 6 read with

Section 7 clearly indicate the fact that an action as contemplated by the

CPC is restricted to regular and summary actions contained therein,

and does not include or even appear to contemplate applications to Labour

Tribunals whose proceedings are neither regular nor summary but are of a

sui generis nature.

(49) Furthermore, in order to substantiate the contention that Labour Tribunals

operate differently from ordinary courts of law, great emphasis was placed

on the distinct nature, function and powers of the Labour Tribunal.

(50) It was submitted that Labour Tribunals are conferred with just and

equitable jurisdiction and are thus empowered to grant compensation to a

workman, even when his/her dismissal is lawful and just, which in turn

cannot be strictly construed as the redressing of a wrong. It was also noted

that Labour Tribunals are entrusted with powers to be more flexible with

procedural and evidential requirements in order to achieve justice and

equity which evince their sui generis nature. Hence, it is argued that the

Respondents contention that Labour Tribunals are courts of law in which

actions are instituted cannot stand.

(51) It was further submitted that this court has upheld the flexible nature of the

Labour Tribunals in Somawathie vs. Backsons Textile Industries Ltd (1973)

79 NLR 204 affirming the position that Labour Tribunals function

differently from courts of law and are not strictly bound by procedural

requirements.

In this case it was held that (pages 206-207),

Labour Tribunals were never intended to perform the functions of Courts

of Law, and make an order whether the applicant is guilty or not of the

allegations made against him by the employer. It is not a verdict that the

Law requires from the President but a just and equitable order -order that

is just and equitable in relation to the employer and employee and the

employer-employee relationship, due consideration being given to

discipline and the resources of the employer and even the interests of the

18

public may have been given thought to. It is for this reason that the Labour

Tribunals are not confined by the rules of evidence. They can adopt their

own procedure, they can act on confession and the testimony of

accomplices so that they can have a free hand to make a fair order.

(52) Furthermore, in the High Court case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority vs.

Chandrawansa (HCRA/52/2011) it was held that, What the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal is required to do at the end of the inquiry

is to pronounce a just and equitable order. This shows that such decisions

should not be untrammeled by the technicalities.

(53) However learned Counsel on behalf of the Respondent submitted that this

Court has been consistent in holding that Labour Tribunals are bound by

the notice requirement stipulated by section 54 as evidenced by the case of

Dissanayake Gamini Ratnasiri vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority

(SC/Appeal/212/12), where it was held that when an employee of the Sri

Lanka Ports Authority files a case in the Labour Tribunal in terms of section

31B of the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), he must give one month notice to

the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in terms of section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports

Authority Act and if he has failed to comply with the said requirement his

application in the Labour Tribunal is bound to be dismissed.

(54) It was further submitted that this position is fortified by the refusal of this

Court to grant leave on this notice requirement matter in R.P. Nandasiri vs.

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SC/SPL/LA/92/2012) and P. Welis vs. Sri Lanka

Ports Authority (SC/SPL/LA/230/2009). When leave to appeal was refused

in P. Welis vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Marsoof PC J stated that in view

of the fact that there is some evidence that a miscarriage of justice might

have occurred in this case, Learned Deputy Solicitor General is requested

by Court to see whether some administrative relief can be afforded, after

considering any appeal that might be made on behalf of the petitioner to

the Respondent Authority with a copy to the Attorney General.

(55) It is argued that this indicates not only the fact that this Court upheld the

mandatory nature of the notice requirement but also indicates that in the

19

event of non-compliance with this mandatory requirement, it is the

Respondent Authority that must decide on equitable considerations.

(56) Commenting on the Backsons Textile case relied on by the Applicant-

Appellant, it was argued that when considering the dicta quoted by the

Applicant-Appellant it is evident that this Court had held that in relation to

rules of evidence, the Labour Tribunals can adopt their own procedure,

which is in fact fortified by Section 34(6) of the Industrial Disputes Act

which provides that In the conduct of proceedings under this Act, any

industrial court, labour tribunal, arbitrator, or authorized officer or the

Commissioner shall not be bound by any of the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance. Therefore, it is argued that the Applicant-Appellants stance in

relation to the Backsons Textile case is misconceived in law.

(57) It was also contended that apart from section 34(6) of the IDA which limits

the application of the Evidence Ordinance to Labour Tribunal proceedings,

there is no other provision in the IDA which broadly grants Labour

Tribunals immunity from Acts of Parliament. Therefore, it is argued that

one months prior written notice to the Respondent Authority as per section

54 of the SLPA Act must be complied with prior to invoking the jurisdiction

of the Labour Tribunal.

(58) Despite Labour Tribunals exercising just and equitable jurisdiction, the

Respondents contention is that equity cannot override Acts of Parliament,

and that when Labour Tribunals make just and equitable orders, they must

do so within the four corners of the existing legal framework which

includes the SLPA Act.

(59) In order to illustrate this point, the Respondent cites the following cases,

In Hayleys v Crossette 363 NLR 248 it was held that,

. It is indeed a strange proposition to state that, when section 24 of the

Industrial Disputes Act conferred jurisdiction on the Industrial Court to

make such award as may appear to the Court to be just and equitable such

a Tribunal can completely disregard the law of the country and act in an

arbitrary manner. In my opinion, the Industrial Court should take into

20

account the law of the country, and, in particular, the law governing

contracts.

(60) In Richard Peiris & Co. Ltd vs. Wijesiriwardena 262 NLR 233 it was held

that,

In regard to the power of the Tribunal to make such order as may appear

to be just and equitable there is point in the Counsels submission that

justice and equity can themselves be measured according to the urgings of

a kind heart but only within the framework of the law.

(61) In Municipal Council of Colombo vs. Munasinghe 71 NLR 223, H.N.G.

Fernando CJ held that,

where the Industrial Disputes Act confers on an Arbitrator the discretion

to make an Award which is Just and Equitable the Legislature did not intend

to confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of the wild horseAn Arbitrator

holds no license from the Legislature to make any such Award as he may

pleases, for nothing is Just and Equitable which is declared by whim or

caprice or by the toss of a double headed coin.

(62) Therefore, it is the Respondents position that the Labour Tribunal is bound

by the Acts/Ordinances/ Laws and Statutes of Parliament and therefore just

and equitable orders envisaged under the Industrial Disputes Act must be

made within the framework of the law of the country.

(63) The Applicant-Appellant had contended that all actions under the CPC have

to either be regular or summary actions as outlined in Section 7 of the

CPC. However, in the case of In re Goonesingha 44 NLR 75 it was held that

the classification of actions as regular and summary is not exhaustive.

Mosley S. P. J. held that,

Crown Counsels argument was that section 6 is qualified by section 7,

which provides that the procedure of an action may be either regular or

summary, and contended that the procedure upon an application for a

writ of certiorari is neither regular nor summary. A somewhat similar

argument had been advanced in Subramaniam Chetty v. Soysa (supra) in

21

which the question for decision was whether proceedings to set aside a sale

constituted an action. That view was rejected by Bertram C. J., who

conceived, for the purposes of the case before him, the possibility of an

action within an action. That, of course is not the case here, but, at all

events, Bertram C.J. does not appear to have considered that the

classification of actions in section 7 as regular or summary is exhaustive.

(64) In the more recent case of Jayawardene vs. Obeysekere and 5 Others, J. A.

N. de Silva C.J., held,

The Civil Procedure Code itself, despite the wording in section 7 paves the

way for another type of proceedings i.e. found in chapter VIII to be followed

in respect of liquid claims. The procedure set out therein is distinctly

different to the regular procedure as well as the summary procedure

already referred to.

.

The legislature may have in its wisdom adopted various procedures to be

followed in relation to the diverse actions which it deems appropriate.

(65) Accordingly, the contention of the Applicant-Appellant that all actions

under the CPC must follow either the regular or summary procedure

as specified in Section 7 cannot be supported.

(66) The main argument raised by the Applicant-Appellant is that an application

before a Labour Tribunal is not an action within the meaning of the CPC.

In order to assess this contention, it would be useful to determine judicial

pronouncements surrounding the term action.

(67) In M. L. Marikkar vs. Abdul Aziz 1 NLR 196, it was held that the term

action does not encompass insolvency proceedings. Withers, J. stated

Action is not an apt term to describe insolvency proceedings, the procedure

in regard to which is regulated by Ordinance No. 7 of 1853.

22

(68) In Silverline Bus Co., Ltd vs. Omnibus Co., Ltd 58 NLR 193, the Privy

Council held that an application for a writ of certiorari does not come

within the meaning of the term action as defined in the CPC. Basnayake,

C. J., held,

A writ of certiorari is not a means of obtaining a relief or remedy

through the Courts power or authority. It is purely a supervisory function

of the Court, while section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code contemplates an

entirely different function. In my view it would be wrong to read section 6

by itself without reference to other provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

To my mind section 6 when read with the other sections of the Civil

Procedure Code leaves no room for the view that a writ of certiorari falls

within the definition of action in the code

(69) The cases referred to above suggest, that not all applications or proceedings

before a Court of Law can be classified as actions as defined in the CPC.

In determining whether an application or proceeding falls within the

meaning of an action as per the CPC, it must be examined whether the

Court is exercising its ordinary power or authority when dealing with such

application or proceeding.

(70) The Applicant-Appellant in addition to contending that a Labour Tribunal

is not a Court, has highlighted many features of Labour Tribunals which

distinguish applications before such Labour Tribunals from ordinary claims

before a Court. The differences that exist between Labour Tribunals and

ordinary Court of law can be seen from an examination of the history

surrounding the establishment of Labour Tribunals.

(71) The Industrial Disputes Act was enacted in 1950 with the aim of

preventing, investigating and settling industrial disputes and for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto, as indicated in its long title. It

has long been recognized that the object and purpose of this Act is the

maintenance and promotion of industrial peace. In Colombo Apothecaries

Co. Ltd Vs. Wijesooriya [70 NLR 481 at p. 490], G.P.A. Silva J said that .

there can be hardly any doubt-that the sole object of the Act is the

promotion and maintenance of industrial peace.

23

(72) Originally, the remedies provided to a workman under this Act were limited

to, conciliation, arbitration, collective bargaining and Industrial Courts.

However, these remedies had certain drawbacks. For example, arbitration

greatly depended on the co-operation of the employer, when the employer

failed to co-operate with the voluntary arbitration process, the only

effective remedy available was compulsory arbitration at the discretion of

the Minister. Thus, if the Minister did not refer the parties to compulsory

arbitration the aggrieved workman would have no remedy available.

(73) Furthermore, when a dispute arose from unfair termination of employment,

there was no direct remedy except under the Common Law of Sri Lanka (i.e.

Roman Dutch Law) where a workman could resort to a civil action against

the employer in the District Court. Since the Roman Dutch Law does not

recognize specific performance of a contract of service, the aggrieved party

was not entitled to reinstatement either directly by an order for

reinstatement or indirectly by an injunction against the employer.

Therefore, the only remedy available in a District Court was damages for

wrongful termination. In R v. National Arbitration Tribunal, ex parte

Horatio Crowther & Co. Ltd (1948) 1 KB 424, it was observed that,

a remedy which no court of law or equity has ever considered it had power

to grant. If an employer breaks his contract of service with his

employees..the workmens remedy is for damages only. A court of equity

has never granted an injunction compelling an employer to continue a

workman in his employment or to oblige a workman to work for an

employer.

(74) In the backdrop of the aforesaid lacunae found in the Industrial Disputes

Act, Labour Tribunals were introduced and established under Part IVA of

the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act No. 62 of 1957, to which

aggrieved workmen whose services had been terminated could directly

apply to for relief. Unlike ordinary courts of law which would only

consider whether the termination was in terms of the contract, Labour

Tribunals go beyond the parameters of the contract in order to ascertain

whether the termination was wrongful and is vested with the power to

24

award reinstatement or compensation to an employee who was unfairly

dismissed even though the termination was in accordance with the

contract, which is in contrast to the approach adopted in the District Courts.

(75) This is clearly evinced by the wording of Section 31B (1)(a) which states

that a workman or a trade union on behalf of a workman who is a member

of that union can make an application to a Labour Tribunal for relief or

redress in respect of the termination of his services by his employer, which

implies that termination in accordance with the contract of employment

does not bar a workman from seeking relief or redress from a Labour

Tribunal. The order of the Tribunal would be on the basis of what appears

to it just and equitable.

(76) The sui generis nature of Labour Tribunals which distinguishes them from

ordinary courts of law in which actions are instituted was highlighted in

the case of The United Workers Union vs. Devanayagam (1967) 69 NLR

289. In this case the Privy Council held that a Labour Tribunal President

did not hold judicial office when dealing with an application made to the

Tribunal. It was also held that when a direct application is made to a Labour

Tribunal, its powers and duties (i.e. to make a just and equitable order) do

not differ from the powers and duties of an arbitrator, an Industrial Court

or a Labour Tribunal on a reference by the Minister or the Commissioner

of Labour. The Privy Council also specifically referred to the fact that in

dealing with applications, the Labour Tribunals are not restricted by the

terms of the contract of employment in granting relief or redress. Therefore,

Labour Tribunals perform a different function to that of an ordinary Court

of law.

(77) In consideration of the unique nature of Labour Tribunals and the rationale

behind their establishment, the inference that can be drawn is that for the

purpose of Section 54 of the SLPA Act, applications filed in the Labour

Tribunals cannot be considered as actions contemplated in section 54 of

that Act. Despite the Respondents contention that the Industrial Disputes

Act does not specifically exclude the application of the SLPA Act, on the

25

interpretation of section 54 it is clear that this procedural pre-requisite has

absolutely no bearing on applications filed in Labour Tribunals.

(78) The Respondent relied heavily on the decided case of Dissanayake Gamini

Ratnasiri vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SC/Appeal/212/12) in support of

their position that Labour Tribunals are bound by the notice requirement

stipulated by Section 54 of the SLPA Act. In the said case it was held as

follows,

Blacks law Dictionary 9th edition page 32, in relation to the word action,

states as follows.

A civil or criminal judicial proceeding- Also termed action at law- An

action has been defined to be an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice,

by which one party prosecutes another party for the enforcement or

protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or punishment

of a public offence.

In the present case, the Applicant-Appellant prosecutes the Respondent for

the enforcement or protection of his right to be in his employment. Thus, in

my view, the application filed in the Labour Tribunal falls within the ambit

of action.

Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Every application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable

through the exercise of the court's power or authority, or

otherwise to invite its interference, constitutes an action.

In the present case the Applicant-Appellant whose services were

terminated by the Respondent has made an application to the Labour

Tribunal for relief which can be obtained through the exercise of the power

of Labour Tribunal. After considering the above legal literature, I hold that

the present application filed in the Labour Tribunal falls within the ambit

of the term action in section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act.

(79) On the basis of the reasons stated above, this court in Dissanayake Gamini

Ratnasiri vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority has come to the finding that an

26

application to a Labour Tribunal is an action within the meaning of Section

54 of the SLPA Act. The Applicant-Appellant in the present action has raised

several novel arguments such as the placement of Section 54 within the

SLPA Act, the distinction between a Court and a Tribunal, as well as the sui

generis nature of applications before Labour Tribunals which, presumably

not urged before the court and thus, not come up for consideration in the

aforementioned case. Consequently, I must most respectfully state that I am

unable to agree with the findings arrived at in the decision of Dissanayake

Gamini Ratnasiri vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

(80) Accordingly, I hold that an application before a Labour Tribunal is not an

action as contemplated in section 54 of the SLPA Act.

Whether the six-month statutory time limit provided for by Section 31B(7)

of the Industrial Disputes Act cannot be fettered by the SLPA Act.

(81) It is noteworthy that Section 31B (7) of the Industrial Disputes Act as

amended by Act No. 21 of 2008 imposes a six-month statutory time limit

from the date of termination for a workman to make an application to a

Labour Tribunal. The Applicant-Appellant submits that the aforementioned

six-month statutory time limit is not subject to any other law. It is also

submitted that the amendment made by Act No. 21 of 2008 represents the

latest intention of the legislature which is to provide an employee six

months to file an application before the Labour Tribunal. Accordingly, the

Applicant-Appellants contention is that prior to the submission of such

application, if one months notice is required to be given under S. 54 of the

SLPA Act, it would only leave 5 months for a workman to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal. The contention is that the latest

intention of the legislature as enacted in 2008, is to grant a six-month limit,

and therefore an unrelated provision cannot be said to override the latest

intention of the legislature reflected in section 31B (7) of the IDA.

(82) In my view, this position of the Applicant-Appellant cannot be supported.

It is indeed possible for two distinct statutes, to set out two different

obligations in relation to the same process, without the later statute

27

necessarily having to supersede the earlier statute. There is nothing to

suggest that the six-month statutory time period cannot be subject to any

other requirements. Nothing in S. 31B(7) of the IDA or Act No. 21 of 2008

suggests that the said section should prevail over the SLPA Act. As the

Respondent contends, when two distinct statutes impose different

requirements or obligations, they should be read harmoniously so as to give

effect to both statutes.

Bindra states that,

When two provisions are mutually contradictory, they should be

interpreted and read together so as to obviate the apparent inconsistency.

[Interpretation of Statutes, 8th Edition (2017) at page 507]

Accordingly, I find the contention of the Applicant-Appellant that the six-

month statutory time limit provided by Act No. 21 of 2008, being the latest

intention of the legislature prevails over all other requirements, cannot be

supported.

Conclusion

(83) In conclusion, this Court has arrived at the following findings. Firstly, an

action as contemplated under section 54 of the SLPA act is an action

against the SLPA in relation to civil claims for damages for any loss, injury

or damage caused to persons or property and does not encompass an

application made by a workman to a Labour Tribunal. Secondly, as the

termination of employment of a workman is not an act done in pursuance

of the SLPA Act, Section 54 does not apply to an application made by a

workman before a Labour Tribunal. Thirdly, an application before a Labour

Tribunal is not an action, as contemplated under section 54 of the SLPA

Act but is a proceeding of sui generis nature.

(84) Therefore, having analysed section 54 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act,

it can be held that Labour Tribunals are not bound by the notice

requirement stipulated in section 54 of that Act and the question of law on

which special leave was granted is answered in the affirmative.

(85) Accordingly, the impugned order of the learned High Court judge dated

24.02.2016 is hereby set aside and the application of the Appellant is

28

remitted to the Labour Tribunal to be dealt with expeditiously as the

circumstances would permit, in accordance with the law.

Under the circumstances of this case, I do not order costs.
