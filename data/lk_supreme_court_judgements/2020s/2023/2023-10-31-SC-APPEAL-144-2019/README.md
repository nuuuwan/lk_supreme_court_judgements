ORDER

Aluwihare PC. J,

The present order is concerned with whether the Petitioner, Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi

Thero can be substituted in the room and place of the deceased 4th Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent, Ven. Munhene Meththarama Thero (hereinafter referred to

as the 4th Defendant) in the instant case. The 4th Defendant was the Viharadhipathi

(Chief Incumbent) of the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya in Trincomalee until

his expiration on 11th May 2021.

The Petitioner is purporting to be the 4th Defendants successor as the Viharadhipathi,

having been appointed by a group of laymen representing the Seruwila Mangala

Maha Chaithyawardena Society (hereinafter the Chaithyawardena Society).

Whereas the 1st Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter the 1st

Respondent) claims that he was appointed as the Viharadhipathi by the Chief Prelate

of the Kalyanawansa Sect of the Amarapura Chapter as per the powers vested on the

5

Chief Prelate in terms of the Constitution of the Kalyanawansa Sect (as supported by

letter of the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs marked D2A which states that

the appointment of the 1st Respondent was accepted by the Commissioner General).

The main application of the instant matter arises from the following events. When

Ven. Seruwila Saranakiththi Thero, in the role of Viharadhipathi, was ill and

hospitalized for treatment, the 1st Respondent along with the 2nd and 3rd Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondents (hereinafter the 2nd and 3rd Defendants) attempted to interfere

in the administration of the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya without a proper

appointment to the said Chief Incumbency and regardless of the fact that the

Viharadhipathi was alive.

In order to maintain peace within the temple, three key office bearers of the

Chaithyawardena Society instituted an action bearing No. SPL/138/16 in the District

Court of Muttur praying for permanent injunction, interim injunction and enjoining

order. The 1st to 4th Defendants named in the said application were the pupils of Ven.

Seruwila Saranakiththi Thero. The now deceased Ven. Munhene Meththarama Thero

was named as the 4th Defendant while Ven. Seruwila Saranakiththi Thero was named

as the 5th Defendant.

In the said action, the District Court of Muttur issued an enjoining order against the

1st to 4th Defendants restraining them from interfering in the administrative affairs of

the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya. Before summons could be served, the

Viharadhipathi, Ven. Seruwila Saranakiththi Thero [ who was cited as the 5th

Defendant] passed away on or about 02nd May 2016 and the Chaithyawardena

Society consisting of the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs appointed the 4th Defendant as the

Viharadhipathi and communicated the fact of the appointment to the Chief Prelate of

the Kalyanawansa Sect. Although the Plaintiffs had originally sought relief against the

4th Defendant, the Plaintiffs moved to withdraw the enjoining order against the 4th

Defendant, facilitating such appointment. The matter proceeded against the rest of

the Defendants and an interim injunction was issued against the 1st to 3rd Defendants

on 19th October 2016.

6

Challenging the aforementioned order of the District Court of Muttur, the 1st to 3rd

Defendants filed a leave to appeal application in the Civil Appellate High Court of the

Eastern Province holden in Trincomalee. The Civil Appellate High Court in turn,

affirmed the interim order of the District Court. Being aggrieved thereby, the 1st

Respondent filed a leave to appeal application before the Supreme Court. Leave to

appeal being granted, the appeal was fixed for hearing. While the appeal was pending

the 4th Defendant passed away on or about 11th May 2021 and the current Petitioner,

Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi Thero sought to be substituted in the place of the deceased

4th Defendant.

At the time of the delivery of the High Court of Civil Appeal decision on 11th January

2019 the 4th Defendant had acceded to the role of the Viharadhipathi having been

appointed in that role by the previous Viharadhipathi, 5th Defendant by virtue of Deed

No. 3011 dated 11th September 2006. His appointment as the Viharadhipathi,

however, had been subsequently cancelled. Challenging the cancellation, the 4th

Defendant had filed action in the District Court of Colombo against the 5th Defendant.

(An interim injunction had been issued against the cancellation by the District Court

of Colombo.

The substitution of the Petitioner in the room and place of the deceased 4th Defendant

in the present matter was objected to by the Respondents alleging that the Petitioner,

Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi Thero was attempting to get undue recognition of the

Supreme Court as the Viharadhipathi of the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya.

The substance of the objections was mainly that there is no need for the substitution

of the Petitioner as his appointment as Viharadhipathi is unacceptable being contrary

to the existing procedure and, that the Petitioner is not a party that stands to be

affected by the interim injunction issued by the District Court of Muttur.

The 1st Respondent stated that the three appointments of Viharadhipathi made in the

years 1984, 2016 and 2021 were effected either through a Deed of Appointment or

by resorting to the procedure set out in the relevant provisions of the Constitution of

the Amarapura Chapter. The 1st Respondent contends that as per the Constitution of

7

the Amarapura Chapter the Chaithyawardena society is merely empowered to make

a recommendation to the Chief Prelate of the Kalyanawansa Sect, which can then be

considered or disregarded at the discretion of the Chief Prelate. The appointment is at

the sole discretion of the Chief Prelate. The 1st Respondent further stated that the

purported appointment of the Petitioner has received neither the required

administrative recognition nor recognition by the Maha Sangha.

Furthermore, the 1st Respondent submitted that the interim injunctions which are the

subject matter of the present appeal were issued against the 1st to 3rd Defendants and

that the deceased 4th Defendant has never been a party affected or benefitted by the

said order. It was further contended that the 4th Defendant was named in the personal

capacity in the actions before the District Court of Muttur and not in the capacity of

the Viharadhipathi of the Seruwila Mangala Maha Viharaya and therefore any

successor to the office of the Viharadhipathi of the said Viharaya has no right to be

substituted.

The Petitioner, on the contrary, stated that he was appointed by the Chaithyawardena

Society in accordance with the temple tradition and/or custom of appointing the

Viharadhipathi of the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya. The claim of the

Petitioner is that the relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Kalyanawansa Sect

are such as to allow the Chaithyawardena Society to appoint a Viharadhipathi of their

choice.

Furthermore, the Petitioner submitted that as the District Court application

principally related to the management, control and decision making of the

Chaithyawardena Society in respect of the Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya and

since the deceased 4th Defendant was the then Viharadhipathi, it is necessary to

substitute his successor in office i.e. the Petitioner, as the present Viharadhipathi, for

the purpose of prosecuting the present appeal as well as in the interests of justice.

It was further submitted that any order made by the Supreme Court substituting the

Petitioner can no way be construed as a judicial pronouncement of the

Viharadhipathiship as alleged by the 1st Respondent and that the said question is a

8

different cause of action for a different application. The Petitioner brought to the

notice of this court that in fact such an application, bearing no. DSP 145/2021, has

been instituted in the District Court of Colombo by the Petitioner. It was emphasized

that the present substitution is intended for the limited purpose of prosecuting the

appeal.

The context of the matter and the contentions of the parties are such, and what

remains to be seen is whether the substitution sought by the Petitioner can be allowed.

Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code read with Rule 38 of the Supreme Court

Rules 1990 makes provision for the substitution of parties in appeals in civil matters.

Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code states that Where at any time after the

lodging of an appeal in any civil action, proceeding or matter, the record becomes

defective, by reason of the death or change of status of a party to the appeal, the Court

of Appeal may in the manner provided in the rules made by the Supreme Court for

that purpose, determine who, in the opinion of the court is the proper person to be

substituted or entered on the record in the place of, or in addition to, the party who

had died or undergone a change of status, and the name of such person shall

thereupon be deemed to be substituted or entered on record as aforesaid.

Rule 38 of the Supreme Court rules states that The Supreme Court may, on

application in that behalf made by any person interested, or ex mero motu, require

such applicant or the petitioner or appellant, as the case may be, to place before the

Court sufficient materials to establish who is the proper person to be substituted or

entered on the record in place of, or in addition to the party who had died or

undergone a change of status;

Upon a plain reading of Rule 38, it is evident that any person interested can make an

application to be substituted in the place of the person who has died, and that

determining who the proper person to be substituted is at the discretion of the court.

As reiterated in Chandana Hewavitharane v. Urban Development Authority (2005) 2

SLR 107 at page 110, by Rule 38, the court is given the discretion to determine who

the proper person to be substituted is. There is no requirement for a person making

9

such application to be a legal heir, administrator, or executor, as the section envisages

applications by any person interested.

Furthermore, substitution is in the interests of the continuation of the case and plays

no role in deciding the rights of the parties. In the Court of Appeal decisions of

Kusumawathie v. Kanthi (2004) 1 SLR 350, at page 354, and Careem v.

Sivasubramaniam and Another (2003) (2) SLR 197 which are relevant to the case at

hand, it was observed that substitution is solely for the purpose of ensuring the

continuation of the appeal after the change of status and not to decide the rights of

the parties. It was submitted on behalf of the 1st Respondent that where there are more

Defendants than one and one of them dies and if the cause of action survives against

the other Defendants alone, the Plaintiff can continue the action without bringing in

the legal representative (vide Duhilanomal and Others v. Mahakanda Housing

Company Limited (19 82) 2 SLR 504).

In the present case, the 1st Respondent avers that Rule 38 cannot be applied to make a

mandatory substitution since the case record will not become defective by the demise

of the 4th Defendant who has been named as a party for the reason of notice, who is

neither a beneficiary nor an affected party by the interim injunctions canvassed before

the Supreme Court. However, even though the case record does not become defective

by the demise of the 4th Defendant it is necessary to consider other reasons that

warrant the substitution of the Petitioner in place of the deceased 4th Defendant.

The 1st Respondent submitted that in an action filed in the personal capacity the

successor to such persons office need not be substituted. It is pertinent to note,

however, that after the death of the 5th Defendant Viharadhipathi Thero, the 4th

Defendant has, in fact, been considered in the capacity of the Viharadhipathi rather

than in his personal capacity before the Doctrict Court. This was indicated by the

Motion dated 15th May 2016 by which the Plaintiffs had informed the District Court

that they will not proceed against the 4th Defendant as he had become the

Viharadhipathi. Therefore, the Plaintiffs considering it necessary to make the

10

incumbent Viharadhipathi a party to the action, following his demise there is no

impediment for his successor to be substituted in the capacity of the Viharadhipathi.

The District Court case DC SPL/138/16 sought to be appealed against, principally

relates to the interference in the management and the affairs of the Seruwila Mangala

Maha Viharaya. In Dheerananda Thero v. Ratnasara Thero 60 NLR 7 at page 9, it was

observed that the temple and the temporalities, by operation of law, belong to the

Viharadipathi of the temple. As the management, control and administration of the

Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya and its temporalities vests with the

Viharadhipathi, an action relating to the interference with the management and

affairs of the temple can hardly be said not to have an impact on the Viharadhipathi

in his official capacity.

We are inclined to override the contention of the 1st Respondent that the 4th Defendant

has never been a party affected or benefited by the issuance of the interim injunctions

against the 1st to 3rd Defendants. For the limited purpose of substitution, we take heed

of the fact that, on the face of it, it seems that the Petitioner has de facto discharged

certain functions of the Viharadhipathi, following the demise of the 4th Defendant (as

per the souvenir issued for the Katina Pinkama 2021 marked X1). The present

matter, arising from the said District Court of Muttur cases, will have an impact on

the management and the affairs of the Seruwila Mangala Maha Viharaya. Therefore,

as the outcome of the appeal before the Supreme Court will affect the Petitioner in the

role of purported Viharadhipathi succeeding the 4th Defendant, and in light of the

application for substitution made by the Petitioner it will serve the interests of justice

to allow the Petitioner to represent his interest in the matter.

While it is not mandatory to make a substitution, whether to make a substitution or

not is at the discretion of the court. This is either ex mero motu or by consideration of

an application for substitution made by any person interested (vide Rule 38 of the

Supreme Court Rules) As set out in Chandana Hewavitharane v. Urban Development

Authority (supra) Rule 38 confers on the Court the discretion to determine who the

proper person to be substituted is. As there is no identifiable impediment to the

11

continuation of the matter by the impugned substitution, and in view of the

application to be substituted made by the Petitioner, it is in the interests of justice to

substitute the Petitioner in the place of the deceased 4th Defendant.

It is to be noted that the substitution of the present Petitioner is not in any way a

judicial pronouncement on the legality or otherwise of the appointment to

Viharadhipathiship of the Petitioner, Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi Thero.

Accordingly, the application for substitution as pleaded in the instant application is

allowed and the Petitioner is directed to file an amended caption within 3 weeks from

today, with notice to other parties.
