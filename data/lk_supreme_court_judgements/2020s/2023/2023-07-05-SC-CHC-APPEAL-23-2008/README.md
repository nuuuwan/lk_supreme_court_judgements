Argued on: 6th December, 2021

Decided on: 5th July, 2023

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

The Plaint

The plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent bank) had instituted action in

the District Court of Colombo to recover money given as an overdraft to the defendant-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant). The respondent stated that the appellant had maintained

a current account at the Gas Works branch of the respondent bank.

The respondent bank stated that, at the request of the appellant, it had provided an overdraft facility

to the appellant on or about the 10th of October, 2000 at a rate of 30% interest per annum.

The respondent bank further stated that, as at 31st of July, 2003 the appellant had an outstanding

amount of Rs. 1,829,489.21 and accrued interest of Rs. 1,212,909.98 to be paid to the respondent

3

bank. Hence, by the letter of demand dated 19th of August, 2002 the respondent bank had requested

the appellant to pay the outstanding amount along with the interest due.

As the appellant failed to settle the said overdraft facility given to him, an action was instituted by

the respondent bank in the District Court of Colombo to recover a sum of Rs. 3,042,398.29/-

against the appellant on the 18th of December, 2003.

The Answer

Thereafter, the appellant filed its answer inter alia denying that a cause of action had been accrued

to the respondent bank to sue the appellant.

Further, the following preliminary objections were raised in the answer filed by the appellant:

(a) this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter in that, the alleged cause of

action falls within the 1st limb of schedule 1 to the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provinces) Act No. 10 of 1996.

(b) the Plaintiff does not have the authority to file this action.

(c) the Plaintiffs purported cause of action is prescribed in law.

The appellant further stated that it does not owe any money to the respondent and that the action

should be dismissed.

Request to transfer the case to the Commercial High Court

On the 3rd of August, 2005 the appellant had made an application to the District Court to transfer

the case to the Commercial High Court in terms of section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996, stating that the District Court has no jurisdiction to hear

and determine actions where the monetary value of the action exceeds Rs. 3 million.

Having considered the said application, the learned District Judge allowed the said application and

transferred the case to the Commercial High Court.

4

Proceedings before the Commercial High Court

The trial had commenced before the High Court, by making admissions and raising issues. After

the respondent bank raised its issues, the appellant raised the following issues:

18. As pleaded in paragraph 2 of the Answer, does the Plaintiff have the authority to file this

action?

19. Has a cause of action accrued to the Plaintiff to sue the Defendant?

20. Does the Appellant have to pay the sum of money due to the Plaintiff as submitted in the

Plaint?

21. Should the Respondents case be dismissed if one or more or all of the above issues are

answered in favour of the Appellant?

Judgment of the Commercial High Court

After an inter-parte trial, the learned High Court Judge delivered the judgment in favour of the

respondent bank and held, inter alia, that in terms of section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance No.

22 of 1871, as amended, the applicable prescription period to recover money lent without a written

agreement is three years. Further, it was held that the prescription period is calculated starting from

the date of the last payment. Moreover, according to the evidence led in the case, the last payment

had been made on the 23rd of April, 2001. Therefore, since the instant case had been filed in the

District Court on the 18th of December, 2003 within the stipulated period of three years, this case

is not prescribed.

Appeal to the Supreme Court

Being aggrieved by the aforementioned judgment of the High Court, the appellant filed an appeal

in the Supreme Court. At the hearing before the Supreme Court, the parties informed court that

they would confine their submissions to the following ground of appeal referred to in paragraph

(b) of the petition of appeal, which is as follows:

5

(b) the learned Judge has not given sufficient thought to question of the action being

prescribed in law

Computation of time for the purpose of considering prescription

An action can be filed for a breach of an agreement/contract, whether the agreement/contract is in

writing or not.

In respect of a written agreement, an action shall be filed within six years from the date of the

breach of the said written agreement (from the date of the cause of action), in terms of section 6 of

the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1971 as amended by Act No. 2 of 1889 [hereinafter referred

to as the Prescription Ordinance]. However, in the case of an unwritten agreement, an action should

be filed within three years from the breach of the said agreement (from the date of the cause of

action), in terms of section 7 of the said Ordinance.

In the instant appeal, it is common ground that the respondent bank had granted the overdraft

facility to the appellant without a written agreement. Hence, section 7 of the Prescription

Ordinance applies to the instant appeal.

Section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance states;

No action shall be maintainable for the recovery of any movable property, rent,

or mesne profit, or for any money lent without written security, or for any money

paid or expended by the plaintiff on account of the defendant, or for money received

by defendant for the use of the plaintiff, or for money due upon an account stated,

or upon any unwritten promise, contract, bargain, or agreement, unless such action

shall be-commenced within three years from the time after the cause of action shall

have arisen. [emphasis added]

Accordingly, the said section imposes a deterrent to institute action after three years from the time

the money became due upon an unwritten agreement.

In the instant appeal, the appellant had made the last payment to repay the overdraft on the 23rd of

April, 2001. Thereafter, the appellant had failed and/or neglected to pay the money due on the

6

overdraft. Hence, the cause of action arose on the 23rd of April, 2001, which is the date of default

in the repayment of the overdraft given to the appellant by the respondent bank.

Further, because the overdraft facility was not granted based on a written agreement, the action

ought to have been filed within three years from the 23rd of April, 2001 in terms of section 7 of the

Prescription Ordinance. Thus, the respondent bank was required to institute the action on or before

the 22nd of April, 2004.

The journal entries maintained by the District Court show that the plaint of the respondent bank

was filed in the District Court on the 18th of December, 2003 which is within the three-year period

stipulated in section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance.

When the District Court case was taken up in court on the 3rd of August, 2005 the appellant had

made an application to the said court to transfer the case to the High Court established under the

High Court of the Provinces Act (Special Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996 [hereinafter referred to

as the High Court of the Provinces Act] in terms of section 9 of the said Act on the basis that the

District Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine cases where the monetary value of the

action exceeded Rs. 3 million (which was the applicable monetary limit at that time).

Accordingly, at the request of the appellant, the instant appeal was transferred to the Commercial

High Court, and the said court had received the case record on the 3rd of August, 2005.

When the case was taken up for trial before the Commercial High Court, the learned counsel for

the appellant raised an objection to the plaint on the basis that the cause of action pleaded in the

plaint is prescribed in terms of section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance. The said objection was

based on the fact that, the case was transferred to the Commercial High Court after three years

from the date of the cause of action alleged in the plaint.

However, after an inter-parte trial, the learned High Court Judge had held that the cause of action

pleaded in the plaint filed by the respondent bank was not prescribed in terms of the Prescription

Ordinance as the case was filed in the District Court within three years from the date of the cause

of action.

Hence, the issue that needs to be considered in the instant appeal is whether the date of institution

of the action in the District Court or the date of transfer of the case from the District Court to the

Commercial High Court should be taken into consideration in computing the prescription period.

7

Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces Act provides for the transfer of cases to the

Commercial High Court. It states as follows:

Where there is evidence that the value of any action filed in any District Court is

one that should have been filed in the High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution exercising jurisdiction under section 2, the Judge shall record such

fact and make order accordingly and thereupon the action shall stand removed to

the appropriate Court. [emphasis added]

The phrase the action shall stand removed to the appropriate Court in the above section 9 shows

that if an action is filed in the District Court which should have been filed in the Commercial High

Court, the case stands transferred to the Commercial High Court by operation of law. Further, there

is no legal provision in the said Act preventing the filing of an action in the District Court where

the cause of action falls within the scope of the High Court of the Provinces Act.

Thus, if a case that falls under the provisions of the said High Court Act is filed in the District

Court, the said court cannot reject the plaint on the basis that the plaint has been filed in the wrong

court or on the basis that the District Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.

However, in such an instance, the District Court has no jurisdiction or power to hear and determine

the case, including the granting of interim relief. Furthermore, the District Court should transfer

such a case to the Commercial High Court in terms of section 7 of the said Act.

Hence, in computing the prescription period, it should be calculated from the date of the alleged

cause of action and the institution of the action in the District Court and not from the date on which

the case was transferred to the Commercial High Court.

As stated above, the journal entries maintained by the District Court show that the plaint was filed

in the District Court on the 18th of December, 2003. As the respondent bank had filed the action in

the District Court within the stipulated time under section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance, the

cause of action pleaded in the plaint by the respondent bank is not prescribed.

The learned counsel for the appellant cited Hatton National Bank Limited v Helenluc Garments

Ltd. and Others [1999] 2 SLR 365 in support of her contention. However, the said judgment has

no relevance to the instant appeal, as the said case relates to an overdraft given subject to a

8

mortgage bond furnished as security for the repayment of the money lent by the defendant. Further,

in the said case, the cause of action arose on the date of the demand.

Further, the learned counsel for the appellant cited Mudiyanse v Siriya 23 NLR 285, Kuluth v

Mohamadu 38 NLR 48 and Amarasekara v Abeygunawardena 56 NLR 361 in support of her

submissions.

The above two cases were filed in the District Court, which lacked jurisdiction to hear the said

cases and therefore, the plaints were returned to be presented to the proper court by the said court

in terms of section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code. However, in the instant appeal, the case was

filed in the District Court and transferred to the Commercial High Court in terms of section 9 of

the High Court of the Provinces Act.

Furthermore, section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code has no application to a case filed under the

said High Court of the Provinces Act. Therefore, the cases cited by the counsel for the appellant

have no application to the instant appeal.

Moreover, the learned Deputy Solicitor General cited Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka v Buddhadasa

and Another [2002] Bar Association Law Report Vol. IX, Part II, 64 and Seylan Bank Limited

v Intertrade Garments (Private) Limited [2005] 1 SLR 80 in support of his submissions. Both of

those cases are in respect of the requirement to demand money lent on a written agreement. In the

instant appeal, there was no requirement to demand the money as it was not lent on a written

contract or agreement, and therefore, there was no request to demand the repayment of that money

given and advanced to the appellant. Therefore, the above cases also have no relevance to the

instant appeal.

Conclusion

Thus, the following ground of appeal should be answered as follows:

The learned Judge has not given sufficient thought to question of the action being prescribed in

law

No

9

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court has

correctly decided that the cause of action pleaded in the plaint is not prescribed.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs. I order a sum of Rs. 100,000 as costs.
