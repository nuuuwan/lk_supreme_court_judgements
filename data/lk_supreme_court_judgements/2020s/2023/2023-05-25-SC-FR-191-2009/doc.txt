RESPONDENTS

Before : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

: A. L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J

: MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA, J

Counsel : Faisz Musthapha PC with Faisza Marker and Thushani Machado

for the 10th and 11th Respondents.

: Rajitha Perera DSG for the 1st and 17th Respondent

[SC FR 191/2009] Page 5 of 6

Decided on : 25.05.2023

Order

Perusal of the Journal Entry dated 25.10.2022 shows that, the bench comprising Hon.

E. A. G. R. Amarasekara, Hon. A. H. M. D. Nawaz, Hon. Achala Wengappuli had taken

up the application made by the 10th and 11th Respondent-Petitioners together and it

can also be seen that one Counsel, Faisz Musthapha PC, had appeared for both 10th

and 11th Respondent-Petitioners. The Court on 25.10.2022 had directed that the

application of the 10th Respondent-Petitioner would be considered by that bench on

the next date i.e., 09.11.2022. As that bench decided to consider the said application

it had directed the Registrar to constitute that bench for the next date i.e., 09.11.2022.

and the bench has taken the view therefore that the Application of 10th Respondent

should also be considered by the same bench.

On 09.11.2022, the same bench had refixed the case to be taken up on 15.02.2023

as the Court did not have adequate time to consider the said Application of the 10th

Respondent- Petitioner.

It was in that backdrop, that this case had been listed inadvertently before the bench

comprising Hon. P. Padman Surasena J, Hon. Shiran Gooneratne J, Hon. Mahinda

Samayawardhena J on 15.02.2023.

As we have detected the above inadvertence, we direct the Registrar to constitute the

bench comprising of Hon. E. A. G. R. Amarasekara J, Hon. A. H. M. D. Nawaz J, Hon.

Achala Wengappuli J, as directed by the said bench on 25.10.2022, to consider the

Application made by the 10th Respondent.

In view of the above, the bench comprising of Hon. P. Padman Surasena, Hon. Shiran

Gooneratne, Hon. Mahinda Samayawardhena, although heard submissions on

15.02.2023, would not make any order on the Application of the 10th Respondent-

Petitioner.

[SC FR 191/2009] Page 6 of 6

Mention this case on 06.07.2023, before a bench comprising Hon. E. A. G. R.

Amarasekara J, Hon. A. H. M. D. Nawaz J, Hon. Achala Wengappuli J, as directed by

the said bench on 25.10.2022. The 10th Respondent-Petitioner is directed to take steps

to have notices served on all parties. Requisite notices should be tendered to the

Registry within two weeks.
