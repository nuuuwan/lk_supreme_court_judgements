JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC. J.,

(1) This matter relates to a partition action. The parcel of land in question,

described in the second schedule to the Plaint, is a divided portion of a larger

land called Bogahakumburehena. The corpus is depicted as Lot No. 1 in Plan

No. 86/87B, prepared by S.M.K.B. Mawalagedara, Licensed Surveyor, for

the previous partition action bearing No. P/7799 (P15), which lot was left

unallotted in the Final Decree of that action, [ i.e P/7799]. The said Lot 1 is

6

shown as Lots 1 and 2 in the Preliminary Plan No. EL/ 529 dated 5th July

1994, which was prepared for the instant case (P16).

(2) The learned District Judge delivered judgement and made order to partition

the corpus as prayed for by the Plaintiff.

(3) Aggrieved by the said judgement the 6A, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th

Defendant-Appellant-Respondents who also claimed title to the corpus

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendants) preferred an appeal

before the Civil Appellate High Court of the Central Province., the learned

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court delivering the judgment, set aside

the judgement of the District Court and directed that decree be entered as

prayed for by the Appellants, namely the 6A, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th

Defendant-Appellant-Respondents before this court.

(4) Aggrieved by the said judgment the Plaintiff Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant [Herein after referred to as the Plaintiff] moved by way of leave

to appeal to the and this Court granted leave to appeal on the questions of

law set out in sub- paragraphs (d) to (i) of Paragraph 17 of the Petition

dated 21st November 2011;

The questions of law are as follows;

(d) Did the High Court of Civil Appeals err with regard to the flow of title

of the Plaintiff-Respondent?

(e) Did the High Court of Civil Appeals err by being misdirected in respect

of the documents 10V4 and 10V6- P20, 21, 22?

(f) Did the High Court of Civil Appeals err by being misdirected to consider

that the 6A, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 Defendants failed to raise a specific issue in

respect of P20, P21 and P22?

7

(g) Did the High Court of Civil Appeals err by failing to consider the

evidence which are in the Petitioners favour?

(h)Did the High Court err by holding that any title passed by virtue of fiscal

conveyance 10V6 (deed 24349) dated 17th September 1968 when the

transferor had no title at that time as the transference had sold his

entitlement by deed No. 6810 dated 27th June 1958?

(i) Did the High Court of Civil Appeals err by misdirecting itself as to the

identification of the corpus while both parties have admitted in respect of

the identification of the corpus?

(5) After considering the appeal, the learned judges of the High Court of Civil

Appeals had arrived at the following conclusions which are material to

determine the issues before us,

(a) The plaintiff or the 1st to 4th Defendants have failed to establish any

interest to the unallotted portion [lots 1 plan No. 86/87B]

(b) That the title of Siyathu to the corpus had been seized, on the strength

of the judgement in case No. L 6625 and sold by the fiscal conveyance.

The claim of the Plaintiff [Appellant]

(6) There had been no dispute as to the identity of the corpus. Both parties

admitted that the land described in the 1st schedule to the Plaint, namely

Bogahakumburehena in extent of two amunams of paddy sowing, was

owned by one Talagollegedara Appu. By Deed No. 10198 dated 2nd June

1909 (P7), he gifted his rights to said land to his six children in equal shares.

The six children were; (1) Punchirala, (2) Mudalihamy, (3) Kirihamy, (4)

Siyathu, (5) Ukku Menika and (6) Punchi Menika. However, both,

Mudalihamy(2) and Ukku Menika(5) had died intestate and issueless and

each of the surviving four children[ i.e.. (1), (3), (4) and (6)] became

entitled to an undivided 1/4th share of the land. [For ease of reference, the

8

number assigned to each of Thalagollegedera Appus children referred to

above, is carried throughout this judgement]

(7) It is also common ground that the undivided 1/4th share of Punchirala (1),

after his death, devolved on his child the 5th Defendant [Aloysius] and that

Kirihamy (3) by Deed No. 10510 dated 21st August 1967 conveyed half of

his undivided 1/4th share to the 5thDefendant [Alloysious], who thus,

became entitled to an undivided 3/8th share of Bogahakumburehena.

(8) According to the Plaintiff, the abovementioned Kirihamy (3) sold and

transferred the balance half of his undivided 1/4th share (1/8th) by Deed

No. 9606 dated 30th May 1919 (P18) to one Kiri Ethana and she in turn, by

Deed No. 29848 (P19) transferred the said share to the Siyathu(4), who

thus became entitled to an undivided 3/8th share of Bogahakumburehena.

It appears that there is no dispute that at one point in time Siyathu accrued

title to 3/8th of the corpus.

(9) To place it in context; it is reiterated that the present partition action was to

partition the land depicted as Lot No. 1 in Plan No. 86/87B which was kept

unallotted in the earlier Partition action[P7799] and this lot represents the

3/8 share of Siyathu(4), the devolution which both the Plaintiff on one hand

and the 6A-10th and the 12th Defendants on the other, are disputing.

(10) On the perusal of the proceedings of the action P/7799(vide page 455 of

the Brief), it appears that Lot No.1 was left unallotted on the basis that the

Fiscal Conveyance [10V6] had not been tendered in evidence. Hence the

share of Siyathu and Kiri Ethana from whom Siyathu had accrued further

rights to Bogahakumburehena, was left unallotted.

The Respective positions of the Plaintiff and the 6A-10th & the 12 Defendants

9

(11) The Plaintiff avers that Siyathu (4), in 1958, by Deed No. 6810 (P20) sold

and transferred his undivided 3/8th share to one W.M.B.K.G. Ranatunga,

who, in 1966, by Deed No. 6180 (P21) sold the said 3/8th share to the

Plaintiffs father, Punchi Appuhamy.

(12) It is the Plaintiffs contention that, on the death of Punchi Appuhamy, his

rights to the corpus, devolved on his children, that is, the Plaintiff and the

2nd to 4th Defendants, subject to the life interest of the 1st Defendant, Koin

Menike (the widow of Punchi Appuhamy).

(13) It is further averred that Punchi Menikas (6) rights to Bogahakumburehena

(an undivided 1/4th share) devolved on her child Tikiri Menika who by

Deed No. 1301 dated 7th May 1969, sold and transferred the same to the

Punchi Appuhamy, the Plaintiffs father . Punchi Appuhamy had transferred

the said th share, to his wife, the 1st Defendant, by Deed No. 5973 in 1973

and thus the 1st Defendant had rights to an undivided 1/4th share of

Bogahakumburehena.

The claim of the 6A-10th and 12th Defendant- Respondents

(14) The 6A to the 10th and 12th Defendants also claimed title to the corpus from

Siyathu(4). In their Statement of Claim, it is averred that, the 5th Defendant

Alloysious [Punchiralas (1) son] who was a minor, through Kirihamy (3),

as his next friend, instituted action bearing No.6625/L, against Siyathu (4),

for a declaration of title to an undivided 1/4th share of three lands originally

owned by Talagollegedara Appu, namely, Bogahakumburegedera watta,

Bogahakumburehena and Kosgahayatatennehena.

(15) The District Court entered judgment and decree in favour of the 5th

Defendant Aloysius (10D4), and Siyathu was ordered to pay costs. It is stated

that since Siyathu(4) failed to pay costs a writ of execution was issued and

his interests in the 3 aforementioned lands were seized and auctioned in

10

order to recover the costs. At the auction held by the Fiscal in execution of

the writ, the rights, title and interest of Siyathu(4) in all 3 lands were sold

and purchased by Kirihamy(3) in 1967. The sale was confirmed by the

District Court on 9th January 1968 (vide page 492 of the Appeal Brief) and

the Fiscals Conveyance No. 24349 (marked 10V6- at page 490 of the

Appeal Brief) was executed in favour of Kirihamy (6).

(16) It is thus contended that Kirihamy (3) purchased Siyathus rights to

Bogahakumburehena (an undivided 3/8th share), and upon Kirihamys

death, his interests devolved on his heirs, that is the 6th -10th Defendants

and the 12th Defendant, and that each of them were entitled to Siyathus

share from Lot No. 1 in Bogahakumburehena.

The points of contention

(17) The learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff contended that at

the time the Fiscal sale took place on 27th November 1967, and the Fiscal

Conveyance [10V6] was executed on 9th January 1968, Siyathu had no title

to Bogahakumburehena as by then, by Deed No. 6810 dated 27th June 1958,

Siyathu had already sold his 3/8th share in the said land to W.M.B.K.G.

Ranatunga. It was argued, therefore, that Kirihamy (3) did not acquire any

title to the said land by the Fiscal sale and as such the claim of the competing

Defendants should fail.

(18) The main contention, on the other hand, of the learned Counsel for the 6A-

10th and 12th Defendants was that the title deeds relied on by the Plaintiff,

namely Deeds No. 6810 (P20), 6180 (P21) and 6197 (P22), all refer to a

land called Egodawatte of about 3 pelas and 1 amunam in extent whereas,

the corpus that was subject to partition; Lot No.1 in Plan 86/87B, is a

divided portion of Bogahakumburahena, and not Egodawatte.

11

(19) It is argued, therefore, that, Siyathus interests in Bogahakumburahena had

devolved on the 6A-10th and 12th Defendants under and by virtue of the

Fiscals Conveyance marked 10V6, while Siyathus interests in Egodawatte

had devolved on the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Respondents under and by

virtue of Deeds P20 and P21. Hence, it is submitted that neither the Plaintiff

nor the 1st to 4th Respondents have any title to the said Lot No.1 of

Bogahakumuburahena.

(20) The learned Counsel on behalf of the competing Defendants also

highlighted the fact that in the execution of the writ against Siyathu for

non-payment of costs in Case No. L/6625, Punchi Appuhamy [from whom

the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants derive their title], made claims to

the properties seized and at the proceedings at the Claims Inquiry (at page

512 of the Appeal Brief), it is recorded that Punchi Appuhamy did not claim

any interests in the lands seized, i.e., Bogahakumbure Watta,

Bogahakumburehena, and Kosgahayatatennehena. It is stated that he only

claimed a land called Egodawatte which was not seized. Mr Walgampaya

who appeared for Punchi Appuhamy had informed court that the claim

made, as a prohibitory notice had been posted on Egodawatta. Concluding

the proceedings, the District Court made the following order, The

judgement creditor will be entitled to sell the judgement debtors interest in

the lands called Bogahakumburegedera Watta, Bogahakumburehena and

Kosgahayatatennahena, but not any portion of the land called Egodawatte

belonging to the Claimants. The Plaintiff, however, contends that

Egodawatte is but another name for Bogahakumburehena.

(21) This case, therefore, revolves around a solitary question; that is, whether the

rights of Siyathu(4) with respect to Bogahakumburehena devolved on

12

Punchi Appuhamy on Deeds Nos. 6810 (P20) and 6180 (P21) or whether

those rights were seized in the execution of the Decree in Case No. L/6625

and were sold to Kirihamy.

(22) Although this court granted leave to appeal on six questions of law, the

thrust of the argument on behalf of the Plaintiff-Appellant, was on two

issues;

(1) That the High Court erred in holding that Kirihamy, [the predecessor

in title of the 5th Defendant] obtained Siyathus share by fiscal

conveyance, when in fact, Siyathu did not have title to the land at the

time the fiscal conveyance was executed.

(2) That the High Court erred in holding that the Plaintiffs title deeds do

not relate to the corpus but to a different land called Egodawatte.

The (1) above, is the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (h) of

Paragraph17 of the Petition on which leave to appeal had been granted,

whereas (2) above touches the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph

(e) of 17.

The Questions of Law

(23) In view of the submission aforesaid, I wish to deal with the questions of law

raised on behalf of the Plaintiff- Appellant referred to in the preceding

paragraph.

(24) The main thrust of the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel was that,

the 5th Defendant Alloysious instituted action against Siyathu(4) and others

claiming undivided 1/4th of Bogahakumburahena upon death of his father

Punchirala(1) and when Siayathu defaulted payment of costs ordered by

13

court, fiscal conveyance was executed in 1968 over Siyathus rights in three

lands inclusive of Bogahakumburahena and it was Kirihamy (3) who

purchased those rights. However, it was pointed out that, prior to the fiscal

conveyance, in 1958 by deed no.6810[P20], Siyathu(4) had sold his 3/8th

share to W.M.B. Ranathunga and as such Kirihamy(3) did not get any title

to the said lands. It was thus argued that the High Court erred and

misdirected itself by not considering this aspect.

(25) Perusal of the schedule to the deed No. 6810[P20], it appears what has been

sold by Siyathu(4) to Ranathunga is a land called godawatte and the

schedule further states Egodawatte forms part and parcel of all three

contiguous lands called- (1) Boghakumburegedarawatte,

(2) Gederagawakumbura and (3) Egodawatte Registered in E 365/212 . It

is to be noted that the name Bogahakumburehena is nowhere mentioned in

this deed. Yet, the, learned Presidents Counsel argued that the boundaries

describing the land Siyathu sold by Deed 6810[P20] and the land described

in the 2nd schedule to the plaint [that was sought to be partitioned] in the

instant case are identical and as such both refer to one and the same land.

(26) This court considered the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Plaintiff and in that regard the following observations are made;

(a) The 1st Schedule to the Plaint in the present case describes the larger

land [presumably which was the subject matter in the Partition action

P/7799] as Bogahakuburahena in extent of 2 Amunams of paddy

sowing.

(b) Even in the case L/6625 filed on behalf of the 5th Defendant

Alloysious way back in 1961, the land is described as

Bogahakumburahena, a land in extent of 2 Amunams of paddy

sowing.

14

(c) The schedule of Deed No. 6810 on which the Plaintiff relied to

support his claim, however, describes the land as Egodawatte, in

extent of one Amunam of paddy sowing.

(d) Partition action P/7799 was instituted in 1970 [P23] and Deed no.

6810 was executed in 1958. As such if Siyathu sold his rights of

Bogahakuburahena to Ranathunga by the said deed, it necessarily

would have been an undivided portion of Bogahakuburahena. If that

was the case the boundaries referred to in the schedule of the deed

6810 must tally with the boundaries of Bogahakumburahena

depicted in plan No.86/87. In Deed no.6810, the Eastern boundary

is stated as, the lands of Mudunkothgedera Sundera, Kirihamy and

the ditch and fence of Tikiri Menika, whereas the Eastern boundary

according to the Plan No.86/87 are the lands of Dingirala and

Bajjurala. Western boundary of the land according to Deed No.6810

is Pangollewatthe of C.P.H Dharmaratne whereas according the Plan

No.86/87, it is Heenhamis land and land of Alice Dharmarathne.

(e) Interestingly, the southern boundary of the land referred to in Deed

No. 6810 is depicted as Ima of Bogahakuburegedera-gawa-

kumbura of the vendor Siyathu, which is an indication, in my view,

that Siyathu owned other property or properties in that name.

(f) It is also to be noted that in Deed no 6810 executed by Siyathu, he

does not say as to how he became entitled to property called

Egodawatte. As far as the land Bogahakumburahena was concerned,

he become a co-owner along with his siblings by virtue of Deed No.

10198 dated 2nd June 1909 (P7), when his father gifted his rights to

said land to his six children in equal shares.

(g) The most crucial evidence, as far as I see it, comes from the claim

inquiry in case No. L.6625 dated 11th July 1967.[Pg 512 of the appeal

15

brief]. The Claimant W.M. Punchi Appuhamy the Plaintiffs father,

who was present before court stated that he does not claim any

interest in the lands called -Bogahakuburegederawatte

-Bogahakuburehena and - Kosgahayatathennehena referred to as

lands seized. He claimed a land called Egodawatte and his Attorney

informed court that Egodawatte is a different land.

(27) Considering the above this court cannot fault the findings by the learned

judges of the High of Civil Appeals in arriving at the findings that the

Plaintiffs title deeds do not relate to the corpus, but to a land called

Egodawatte.

(28) In the circumstances referred to above, I answer the two issues referred to

in paragraph 22 above [ question of law (h) and (f)] in the negative.

(29) Accordingly I hold that; the rights of Siyathu(4) with respect to

Bogahakumburehena did not devolve on Punchi Appuhamy on Deeds Nos.

6810 (P20) and 6180 (P21) and I hold further that the rights of Siyathu

were seized in the execution of the Decree in Case No. L/6625 and were

sold to Kirihamy.

(30) Furthermore, the learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals were

correct in arriving at the conclusion that the plaintiff or the 1st to 4th

Defendants have failed to establish any interest to the unallotted portion,

i.e., lots 1 of plan No. 86/87B.

16

(31) I do not see any merit in the questions of law referred to in sub-paragraphs

(d) (f) (g) and (i) of Paragraph 17 of the petition and the said questions are

also answered in the negative.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, subject to costs
