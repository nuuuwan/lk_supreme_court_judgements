Decided on: 22/09/2023

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

By Plaint dated 02/03/2005, the Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellant) filed this Action No. D.C. Colombo 20654/L

against the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (the Defendant-Respondent), and

sought a declaration that the Plaintiff-Appellant is entitled to Lot 1, 2, 3 and 4 bearing

Assessment Nos. 166/8A and 166/8B, Elvitigala Mawatha, Colombo 5, depicted in Plan

No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, made by I.M.C. Fernando, Licensed Surveyor and a

declaration that the Defendant-Respondent is not entitled to the said land.

In paragraph 1 of the said Plaint, the Plaintiff-Appellant states that her mother M.I.S.S.

Beebi became entitled by Deed of Disposition No. 16007 dated 17/05/1995, attested by

the Commissioner of Department of National Housing, to Lots 5 and 6 bearing

Assessment Nos. 166/8A and 166/8B Elvitigala Mawatha depicted in Plan No. MF

P a g e 4 | 15

46/76 dated 06/08/1976 made by I.M.C. Fernando Licensed Surveyor. The Plaintiff-

Appellant claims entitlement to the said land by virtue of Deed of Gift No. 3 dated

01/01/1996 attested by P.D.R. Priyadharshani, Notary Public.

According to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Plaint, on or about 1997, the Defendant-

Respondent had forcibly entered the southern side of Lot 6 and the eastern side of Lot

5 depicted in the said Plan No. MF 46/76. The Plaintiff-Appellant claims that with the

concurrence of both parties to this action, the said land was resurveyed and the

boundaries were demarcated by the said Plan No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, and further

that Lots 5 and 6 depicted in Plan No. MF 46/76 were amalgamated, sub divided and

depicted as Lots 2, 3 and 4 in Plan No. 2055. The Plaintiff-Appellant also claims Lots

2, 3 and 4 in the said Plan No. 2055, as land encroached by the Defendant-Respondent.

In Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff-Appellant states that, according to the

said Plan No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, the Defendant-Respondent has encroached zero

decimal four two perches (0.42 perches) upon Lots 2, 3 and 4. The Plaintiff-Appellant

relied on the said Plan No. 2055 to claim that, the Defendant-Respondent is using the

encroached land unlawfully for construction purposes thereby causing mischief and

irreparable loss to the Plaintiff-Appellant.

The Defendant-Respondent by amended answer dated 26/10/2005, denies any

encroachment to the said land and states that she has acquired prescriptive title to Lot

No. 4 in Plan No. MF 46/76 depicted as Lots Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in the resurveyed Plan No.

2055, for a period of over 30 years and prayed for a dismissal of the Plaint.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Additional District Judge by Judgment dated

16/01/2009, held inter alia, that the Defendant-Respondent has established

uninterrupted possession of over 30 years to the said Lots Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in Plan No.

2055, and therefore acquired prescriptive title over the said land and accordingly,

dismissed the action of the Plaintiff-Appellant.

P a g e 5 | 15

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Plaintiff-Appellant by Petition of Appeal

dated 12/03/2009, appealed to the High Court of the Western Province exercising civil

appellate jurisdiction holden in Colombo (the Appellate Court). The Appellate Court,

after having also considered the question of the title by prescriptive possession acquired

by the Defendant-Respondent to the relevant Lots, as in the District Court, by Judgment

dated 22/08/2014, affirmed the said Judgment of the Additional District Judge dated

16/01/2009 and dismissed the appeal with costs.

The Plaintiff-Appellant, by Petition dated 03/10/2014 is before this Court, to set aside

the said Judgment dated 22/08/2014, delivered by the Appellate Court.

By Order dated 04/03/2015, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law;

1. Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in effectively failing to take into

consideration the applicability of Section 15(2) of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law No. 1 of 1973 in this instance?

2. Has the Civil Appellate High Court misdirected itself in law by erroneously

determining that the Respondent has established undisturbed, uninterrupted, and

adverse possession, and therefore, has acquired prescriptive title to Lot No.s 5B

and 6B more fully depicted in Plan No. 424/2006 prepared by S. Rasappah,

Licensed Surveyor having regard to Section 15(2) of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law No. 1 of 1973 and/or Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance?

3. Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by failing to determine that the

Respondent had not acquired any prescriptive rights to Lot No.s 2, 3 and 4 in

Plan No. 2055, dated 7th October 2001, prepared by I.M.C. Fernando, Licensed

Surveyor, subsequent to 17th May 1995 as envisaged in terms of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance?

P a g e 6 | 15

In this action, the Plaintiff-Appellant claimed to be entitled to the land and premises

marked Lots 5 and 6 depicted in Plan No. MF 46/76 dated 06/08/1976, made by I.M.C.

Fernando, Licensed Surveyor, marked as P1. The Plaintiff-Appellant further claimed

that the said land was resurveyed by the same Licensed Surveyor, I.M.C. Fernando, and

based on the said resurvey which amalgamated Lots 5 and 6 of Plan No. MF 46/76, the

Plaintiff sought a declaration that she is entitled to Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the resurveyed

Plan No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, P4 (marked subject to proof). Accordingly, the

District Court was called upon to declare the rights of the Plaintiff-Appellant based on

the Resurveyed Plan No. 2055.

The Plaintiff-Appellant contends that the Defendant-Respondent forcibly encroached

upon the said Lots 5 and 6 in Plan No. MF 46/76, which were later depicted as Lots 1,

2, 3 and 4 in Plan No. 2055. The Plaintiff-Appellant alleges that the Defendant-

Respondent is constructing a toilet in the encroached land and has caused damage to

her land.

When this matter came up before the trial court, at the request of the Defendant-

Respondent, the court appointed Surveyor S. Rasappah, who prepared Plan No.

424/2006 dated 18/08/2006, marked as X, and the Surveyors Report marked as X1.

Both parties relied on the said Plan No. 424/2006 and the said Surveyor Report.

Surveyor Rasappah in his evidence stated that Plan X was prepared by superimposing

Lot 4 (belonging to the Defendant-Respondent), and the said Lots 5 and 6 of Plan No.

MF 46/76. Accordingly, the said Lot 4 is depicted as 4A and 4B, Lot 5 as 5A and 5B,

and Lot 6 as 6A, 6B and 6C. Lot 4A is a building occupied by the Defendant-

Respondent and Lot 4B is the right of way to the premises owned by the Defendant-

Respondent. Lots 5A and 6A, consist of the building occupied by the Plaintiff-Appellant

and Lot 5B is also made use of by the Defendant-Respondent as a right of way.

P a g e 7 | 15

According to Surveyor Rasappah, Lot 6B is identified as the portion encroached by the

Defendant-Respondent. He repeatedly stated to the trial court that he was not privy to

the Resurveyed Plan No. 2055 marked P4, when preparing Plan X.

According to the said survey report marked X1, the roadway depicted as Lot 5B, is

used by the Defendant-Respondent without any disturbance or interruption by the

Plaintiff-Appellant. The Surveyor has also observed that the permanent wall and the tin

sheet wall separating Lots 6A and 6B, and the building constructed therein are over 20

years.

The Plaintiff-Appellant contends that the Defendant-Respondent has encroached upon

Lot 5B, which is presently used as a roadway and the encroachment upon Lot 6B. It is

in evidence that Lots 6A and 6B are separated by a permanent wall and a tin sheet fence

which extends up to the disputed toilet used by the Defendant-Respondent.

The Plaintiff-Appellant did not call into question Surveyor Rasappahs assertion based

on experience, that the said wall was in place for over 20 years nor placed any evidence

to the contrary. The Plaintiff-Appellant also did not question the surveyor on the alleged

encroachment to Lot 6B, which is used as a roadway by the Defendant-Respondent.

The Plaintiff-Appellant in her evidence admitted that the said wall demarcated the

boundaries of the land owned by the respective parties and that the said wall was

constructed by the Defendant-Respondent. Answering a question posed by Court, the

Plaintiff-Appellant stated that she cannot remember the period when the tin sheet wall

was constructed, however, at a later stage stated that the wall was constructed after

1995. The Plaintiff-Appellant did not place any further evidence to substantiate the said

claim nor put in issue the encroachment to Lot No. 6B, used as a roadway by the

Defendant-Respondent.

The Defendant-Respondents position in brief is that she resides in the said premises

since 1971 and the said wall existed prior to 1983 as a timber plank wall and thereafter,

the present wall was constructed around 1984. Whilst admitting that Lots 5 and 6 in

P a g e 8 | 15

Plan marked P1 belong to the Plaintiff-Appellant, the Defendant-Respondent

completely disassociated herself with any knowledge of the existence of Plan No. 2055

or to the veracity of the boundaries depicted therein. Before parting with her cross

examination, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant suggested to the

Defendant-Respondent that Lots 5 and 6 (clearly in reference to Plan No. MF 46/76)

belong to the Plaintiff-Appellant, to which the Defendant-Respondent answered in the

affirmative. An issue raised by the Defendant-Respondent to establish uninterrupted

possession of the toilet situated in the northern part of Lot 4 in Plan No. 46/76 shown

as Lots 2, 3 and 4 of Plan No. 2055, for over 30 years, was decided in favor of the

Defendant-Respondent. The dispute between the parties to this action clearly arise from the boundaries to the

land and premises depicted in Plan No. 2055. The Defendant-Respondent did not

dispute the boundaries of the land and premises marked Lots 5 and 6 depicted in Plan

No. MF 46/76 and accordingly, the trial court held that the Plaintiff-Appellant was

entitled to Lots 5 and 6 in the said Plan No. MF 46/76.

As stated earlier, the Plaintiff-Appellant relied on Plan No. 2055 made by I.M.C.

Fernando, Licensed Surveyor marked P4, for relief as prayed for. Surveyor I.M.C.

Fernando was deceased at the time this case came up for trial and a survey report in

respect of the said Plan No. 2055 is also not part of the record.

In the said Judgment dated 16/01/2009 in case No. D.C. Colombo 20654/L, the learned

Additional District Judge inter alia held,

1) that the said Plan No. 2055 remains a document that has not been duly proved

by the Plaintiff-Appellant,

2) that the land occupied by the Defendant is enclosed by a permanent wall and Tin

roofing sheets for a period of over 20 years,

3) that no forced entry to the Plaintiffs land by the Defendant has been revealed in

evidence.

P a g e 9 | 15

The Court held that the Plaintiff-Appellants claim that the Defendant-Respondent has

encroached Lot 6 was not proved and accordingly, dismissed the action of the Plaintiff-

Appellant.

As stated earlier, in its Judgment dated 22/08/2014, the Appellate Court inter alia,

considered the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the Defendant-Respondent

of the relevant Lots Based on Plan No. 424/2006 made by Rasappah Licensed Surveyor,

the Appellate Court inter alia, held that the subdivided lot 5B is presently used by the

Defendant-Respondent as a right of way and the subdivided lot 6B remains a part of

the Defendant-Respondents land attached to Lot No. 4.

The Appellate Court further held that;

The very important factor reveals from the Surveyor's Report is that the said

subdivided Lots 6A and 6B are partitioned and separated by the said permanent wall

and the galvanized sheet fence and the said fence and wall runs up to the place where

the defendant's latrine is situated. In terms of said plan and report the subdivided lots

5B and 6B are within the possession of the defendant and declared that the defendant

has prescribed to the sole possession of subdivided lots marked 4A, 4B, 5B and 6B in

the said plan marked X.

With regard to Plan No 2055, the Appellate Court, whilst commenting that it remains a

document that has not been duly proved, stated that Plan Bearing No. 2055 does not

show a latrine and a kitchen alleged to have been built by the Defendant in the

Plaintiffs land.

The Appellate Court, affirmed the Judgment of the learned trial Judge and dismissed

the appeal with costs.

In this regard, it is observed that-

P a g e 10 | 15

a) the Plaintiff-Appellant filed this action seeking a declaration that the Plaintiff-

Appellant is entitled to Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 2055 and a further

declaration that the Defendant-Respondent is not entitled to the said land;

b) Plan No. 2055, dated 07/10/2001 was made by I. M. C. Fernando, the same

surveyor who made the Original Plan No M.F. 46/76 dated 06/08/1976;

c) as commented upon earlier in this Judgment, the Commission Plan No.

424/2006, made at the request of the Defendant-Respondent, established that the

Defendant-Respondent had encroached on to the Plaintiff-Appellants land;

d) both courts below were of the view that the Defendant-Respondent had

encroached on the Plaintiff-Appellants land based on the said Commission Plan

No. 424/2006, however, they decided that the Defendant-Respondent was

entitled to prescriptive title to the encroached land, even though any relief was

not claimed by the Defendant-Respondent to that effect;

e) In his evidence before the trial court, Surveyor Rasappah clearly stated that he

was unaware of the existence of the said Plan No. 2055 and did not consider the

said plan when making Plan No. 424/2006;

f) Surveyor Rasappah made use of the Original Plan No. M.F. 46/76 to prepare the

said Plan No. 424/2006 and not Plan No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, on which the

Plaintiff-Appellant based her claim for relief;

g) The purported encroachment by the Defendant-Respondent on the Plaintiff-

Appellants land, as reflected in the Commission Plan No. 424/2006, is based on

the Original Plan No. M.F. 46/76, dated 06/08/1976, with no reference to Plan

No. 2055, which the Plaintiff-Appellant relied upon;

h) Even though the Appellate Court decided on the prescriptive rights of the

Defendant-Respondent, and in her favour; the Defendant-Respondent did not

pray for any relief, other than the dismissal of the said action.

The Plaintiff-Appellants relief as prayed for in the Plaint dated 02/03/2005, is based

on Plan No. 2055. The Defendant-Respondent consistently disputed and rejected Plan

P a g e 11 | 15

No. 2055 on the basis that the said plan was not duly read in evidence and that a survey

report thereon is not available.

Although the Plaintiff-Appellants relief, was based on Plan No. 2055, the Plaintiff-

Appellant failed to follow due procedure according to law to establish the death of the

surveyor or to call a competent witness to read the said Plan in evidence. Plan No. 2055

was never shown to the Court appointed surveyor when he visited the land and there is

no reference made to the said Plan in the Commission Plan/ Report tendered in

evidence. Both the trial court and the Appellate Court has referred to the said Plan No.

2055 as a document which was not duly proved.

The Plaintiff-Appellant did not place any material before this Court to negate the said

stand that Plan No. 2055 was not duly proved as contended by the Counsel for the

Defendant-Respondent and upheld by the courts below.

The Plaintiff-Appellant came before the trial court seeking a declaration that she is

entitled to Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 2055, dated 07/10/2001. Accordingly,

the trial court was called upon to decide on the Plaintiff-Appellants rights based on

Plan No. 2055.

In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is of the view that Plan No. 2055 was not

adequately proved to determine the rights of the Plaintiff-Appellant.

In discussing the duties and obligations of the Plaintiff-Appellant and the Defendant-

Respondent respectively, in an action for declaration of title to land, (as in this instance),

reference may be made to the following cases decided by our Appellate Courts.

a) Menikgama Arachchige Don Ananda Vs. Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangarakkitha

Thero, Viharadhipathi and Trustee, Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, Kelaniya- CA

908/96 F, CA minutes dated 23/04/2012

In the course of the Judgment in this case, the Court of Appeal,

P a g e 12 | 15

I. stated that the Plaintiff sought to vindicate his title to the subject matter of the

action, to wit, the land described in schedule 2 of the Plaint, which had been

pleaded by the Plaintiff was as a portion of the land more fully set out in

schedule 1, and that, From the issues suggested by the Plaintiff, it is quite clear

that the Plaintiff has not made any attempt to identify the land described in

schedule 2 of the Plaint as a portion of the larger land described in schedule

1. The Court went on to state that It is common knowledge that without

establishing title to the larger land described in schedule 1 of the Plaint, the

Plaintiff cannot succeed in establishing his title to the land described in

schedule 2 of the Plaint. It is of paramount importance in an action of this

nature, to identify and establish the identity of the subject matter and the title

by adducing clear evidence to obtain a declaration of title and ejectment of the

Defendant;

II. stated that It is trite law that the burden in a rei vindicatio action is on the

plaintiff to prove ownership to the subject matter of the action. More so when

the defendant is in possession of the corpus;

III. referred to the case of Dharmadasa Vs. Jayasena (1997) 3 SLR 327, which is

mentioned in, b) below;

IV. stated that the Plaintiff failed to prove that the subject matter of the action was

vested in him, and that he had given no evidence whatsoever to prove it;

and allowed the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant and set aside the Judgment of the

District Judge in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent.

a) b) Dharmadasa Vs. Jayasena (Supra) which states in the headnote that-

The Plaintiff sued the Defendant for a declaration of title and ejectment. The

Plaintiff based his claim on a Grant from the Urban Council, Anuradhapura.

P a g e 13 | 15

Held: in a rei vindicatio action the burden is on the Plaintiff to establish the title

pleaded and relied on by him. The Defendant need not prove anything. The Grant

relied on by the Plaintiff was invalid. Hence the Plaintiff has failed to establish his

title.

In the course of the Judgment in this case, the Supreme Court stated that The

Authorities unite in holding that the Plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute

and that if he cannot, the action will not lie. per Macdonell C.J., at page 219, in

De Silva Vs. Goonetilleke (1931) 32 NLR 217. The principle was lucidly stated by

Herat J. in Wanigaratne Vs. Juwanis Appuhamy (1964) 65 NLR 167 in the

following terms The defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove anything,

still less his own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour

merely on the strength that the defendants title is poor or not established. The

plaintiff must prove and establish his title. This, the plaintiff has failed to do, and

his action must therefore fail.

c) Terrence Clinton Percival Thirunayake Vs. M George Anthony Fernando (SC

Appeal No.18B of 2009) SC minutes dated 07/03/2014

The Plaintiff instituted a rei vindicatio action in 1994, in the District Court of

Kurunegala, inter alia, seeking a declaration of title that the Plaintiff is the owner

of the land described in the second schedule to the Plaint and for an order ejecting

the Defendant and his agents occupying a portion of the land. The District Judge

gave Judgment, in 2001, in favour of the Plaintiff, against which the Defendant

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court.

The Civil Appellate High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the Judgment of

the District Judge on the basis that the land in dispute has not been precisely

identified and the land described in the schedule to the Plaint is different in that the

land is a larger land; against which order of the Civil Appellate High Court the

Plaintiff filed an appeal to the Supreme Court.

P a g e 14 | 15

In the course of the Judgment in this appeal, the Supreme Court

I. citing the decision in Peiris Vs. Sinnathamby, 54 NLR 207, stated that . in

a rei vindicatio action claiming a declaration of title and ejectment it is a

paramount duty on the part of the petitioner (appellant in this case) to establish

correct boundaries in order to identify the Corpus. Referring to the evidence

produced by the Appellant the Court stated further, Therefore, it is obviously

clear that the Appellant has failed to produce evidence to identify the land in

dispute and that this being an action rei vindicatio there is a greater and

heavy burden on the part of the Appellant to prove not only that he has a

dominion to the land in dispute but also the specific precise and definite

boundaries when claiming a declaration of title and

II. agreeing with the submissions of the Counsel for the Respondent, concluded

that . the land in dispute has not been precisely and definitely described

in the schedule to the Plaint in terms of the Law., dismissed the Appeal,

affirming the Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court.

In view of the above and from what has been stated earlier in this Judgment, it is clear

that the Plaintiff-Appellant has failed to fulfill the obligations and duties and duly

discharge the burden of proof, which is required of a Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action,

which have been described above, particularly, in regard to the establishment of the

identity of the property in respect of which declarations are sought in such a rei

vindicatio action and the due establishment of the title of the Plaintiff thereto.

The Defendant-Respondent has also made extensive submissions in this regard, in the

written submissions dated 03/07/2015 and 17/03/2023 filed in this Court, that the reliefs

sought by the Plaintiff-Appellant are untenable in Law, with which I agree.

In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that, in deciding on this Appeal, the three

questions on which leave to appeal to this Court have been granted and which have

P a g e 15 | 15

been quoted earlier in this Judgment need not be considered and, with respect, I answer

such three questions accordingly.

For these reasons, the Judgment dated 16/01/2009 of the Additional District Judge and

the Judgment dated 22/08/2014 of the Appellate Court are hereby affirmed and this

Appeal is dismissed. No order for Costs.
