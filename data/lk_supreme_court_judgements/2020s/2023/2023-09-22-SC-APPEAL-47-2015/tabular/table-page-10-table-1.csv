"a) 
the Plaintiff-Appellant filed this action seeking a declaration that the Plaintiff-"
"Appellant is entitled to Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 2055 and a further"
"declaration that the Defendant-Respondent is not entitled to the said land;"
"b)  Plan  No.  2055,  dated  07/10/2001  was  made  by  I.  M.  C.  Fernando,  the  same"
"surveyor who made the Original Plan No M.F. 46/76 dated 06/08/1976;"
"c)  as  commented  upon  earlier 
in 
this  Judgment, 
the  Commission  Plan  No."
"424/2006, made at the request of the Defendant-Respondent, established that the"
"Defendant-Respondent had encroached on to the Plaintiff-Appellant’s land;"
"d)  both  courts  below  were  of 
the  view 
that 
the  Defendant-Respondent  had"
"encroached on the Plaintiff-Appellant’s land based on the said Commission Plan"
"No.  424/2006,  however, 
they  decided 
that 
the  Defendant-Respondent  was"
"entitled to prescriptive title to the encroached land, even though any relief was"
"not claimed by the Defendant-Respondent to that effect;"
"e) 
In his evidence before the trial court, Surveyor Rasappah clearly stated that he"
"was unaware of the existence of the said Plan No. 2055 and did not consider the"
"said plan when making Plan No. 424/2006;"
"f)  Surveyor Rasappah made use of the Original Plan No. M.F. 46/76 to prepare the"
"said Plan No. 424/2006 and not Plan No. 2055 dated 07/10/2001, on which the"
"Plaintiff-Appellant based her claim for relief;"
"g)  The  purported  encroachment  by  the  Defendant-Respondent  on  the  Plaintiff-"
"Appellant’s land, as reflected in the Commission Plan No. 424/2006, is based on"
"the Original Plan No. M.F. 46/76, dated 06/08/1976, with no reference to Plan"
"No. 2055, which the Plaintiff-Appellant relied upon;"
"h)  Even  though  the  Appellate  Court  decided  on  the  prescriptive  rights  of  the"
"Defendant-Respondent,  and  in  her  favour;  the  Defendant-Respondent  did  not"
"pray for any relief, other than the dismissal of the said action."
