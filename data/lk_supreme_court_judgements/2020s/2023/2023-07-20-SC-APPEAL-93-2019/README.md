Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Respondents-Respondents-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Respondents-Appellants) had

initiated the instant appeal against the order of the High Court of Avissawella in a Labour Tribunal

Appeal Pending before the said High Court.

As revealed before us the Applicant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-

Respondent) who was employed by the Respondents-Appellants as a Field Officer, filed an

application before the Labour Tribunal of Avissawella against the unlawful termination of him by the

said employer.

When the Labour Tribunal dismissed his application by order dated 23rd October 2014, and being

dissatisfied with the said order the Applicant-Respondent appealed against the said order to the High

Court of Avissawella. The learned High Court Judge by his order dated 27th November 2017 allowed

the appeal and reinstated the Applicant-Respondent with back wages.

Against the said order the Respondents-Appellants had sought special leave from the Supreme Court

and this Court on 28th May 2019 granted special leave on the following questions of law.

d) Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to consider that the Labour

Tribunal is the best judge of the facts and or by replacing the Tribunals findings with

his own view of the facts?

e) Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to consider the past record of

the Respondent and or its impact in differentiating the respondent from other

employees in the taking of disciplinary action for misconduct?

f) Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in giving undue weight to the non-

production of the Domestic Inquiry Report when, in any event, the burden is on the

Petitioners to justify termination of employment before the honourable Labour

Tribunal?

l) In any event, has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in granting reinstatement

to the Respondent and failing to take cognizance of the fact that the Petitioners cannot

repose any confidence in the Respondent and or that reinstatement would, in these

circumstances, disrupt discipline and or industrial harmony in the Petitioner company?

The Applicant-Respondent who was recruited as a Junior Assistant Field Officer in the year 1997 to

Udabage Estate was working as a Field Officer of Woodend Estate -Dehiovita at the time his services

were terminated by the Respondents-Appellants. Prior to his termination, the Applicant-Respondent

was served with two charge sheets by his employer and a domestic inquiry was held against him.

Consequent to the said inquiry his services were terminated with effect from 18th December 2011.

The Applicant-Respondent who went before the Labour Tribunal of Avissawella against the said

termination had prayed inter-alia a reinstatement from the date of suspension from the service, back

wages, and compensation for illegal, unfair, and unlawful termination of his service. He has further

complained to the Labour Tribunal that there was no proper evidence led against him at the domestic

inquiry and therefore the employer could not establish charges against him.

As revealed before us two sets of charges were framed against the Applicant-Respondent at the

Domestic Inquiry. The first charge sheet dated 01.11.2010 was produced at the inquiry before the

Labour Tribunal marked R41A and the second charge sheet dated 22.03.2011 was produced marked

R9A. The first set of charges was based on the alteration of entries in the books maintained by the

Applicant-Respondent. The other charges were based on the duties entrusted to a casual labourer as

against the rubber tappers.

The extent to which the facts that were revealed before the Labour Tribunal should be considered by

an Appellate Court and whether the High Court had analyzed the evidence placed before the Labour

Tribunal in its correct perspective was the basis for the questions of law that were to be considered

by me in the instant judgment.

Section 31 D (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended- hereinafter referred to as

the Act) does not permit an appeal from the Labour Tribunal on the questions of facts. However, in

the case of Ceylon Transport Board Vs. N. M. J. Abdeen 70 NLR 407, it was held by the Supreme Court

that,

Where the President of a Labour Tribunal misdirects himself on the facts, such misdirection

amounts to a question of law within the meaning of section 31D (2) of the Act.

In the case of Ceylon Transport Board Vs. W.A.D. Gunasinghe 72 NLR 76 it was also held that,

Where a Labour Tribunal makes a finding of fact for which there is no evidence a finding

which is both inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it the restrictions of the

5

right of the Supreme Court to review questions of law does not prevent it from examining and

interfering with the order based on such findings if the Labour Tribunal is under a duty to act

judicially.

In the case of The Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber Estates Ltd Vs. J.S. Hillman, it was held that,

Inasmuch as an appeal lies from an order of a Labor Tribunal only on a question of law an

Appellant who seeks to have a determination of facts by the Tribunal set aside must satisfy

the Appellate Court that there was no legal evidence to support the conclusion of facts

reached by the Tribunal, or that the finding is not rationally possible and is perverse even with

regard to the evidence on record

In the above circumstances, it is clear that an Appellate Court will not simply interfere with the

findings of a Labour Tribunal unless the order made by the Labour Tribunal is perverse, the evidence

is not supportive of the conclusion reached, the evidence is inconsistent or contradictory with the

finding.

Even if the Appellate Court takes a different view, regarding an appeal before such Court, the evidence

supports the view taken by the Labour Tribunal, in such a situation the role of the Appellate Court

was discussed in the case of Ceylon Cinema and Films Studio Employees Union V. Liberty Cinema

(1994) 3 Sri LR 121 as follows;

The question of assessment of the evidence is within the province of the Labour Tribunal and

if there is evidence on record to support its findings, the Appellate Court cannot review those

findings even though on its own perception to the evidence it may be inclined to come to a

different conclusion.

When the Applicant-Respondent appealed against the findings of the Labour Tribunal to the High

Court, the High Court by its order dated 27th November 2017 allowed the Appeal and made an order

to reinstate the Applicant with back wages. Since the High Court decided to interfere with the finding

of the Labour Tribunal in appeal, this Court will consider the legality of the said order, and in the said

circumstances this Court will be considering the evidence led before the Labour Tribunal and the

matters that were considered by the High Court when reversing the finding of the Labour Tribunal.

During the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal the Respondents (Respondents-Appellants before this

Court) led the evidence of three witnesses including the General Manager of Mahaoya Group

Thilakarathne, two Managers from Pinkanda Estate, Cristopher Senevirathne, and Rangajeewa

Alahakoon. During their evidence, it was revealed that when the Applicant (Applicant-Respondent

before this Court) was working as a field officer at Woodend Division of Mahaoya Estate he was served

with a letter dated 20.07.2010 calling his explanation for discrepancies observed between the latex

weighing register and the daily progress report both prepared by the Applicant. The above

discrepancy was further observed on the name cards of the Rubber Tappers. According to the

witnesses, these figures should be the same, and the wages of the tappers were prepared on the

information contained in those documents. The name cards carried by the tapper will indicate the

quantity of latex collected by the tapper and the said figure cannot be different from the entries made

in the weighing register. The above discrepancies were further observed in the daily wages form on

which the salaries were paid to the Rubber Tappers.

Since the explanation provided by the Applicant was unsatisfactory, the management of Mahaoya

Group decided to inquire into the said matter and a charge sheet was issued to the Applicant with

two charges (R41A)

Whilst the above inquiry was pending against the Applicant another charge sheet was served on the

Applicant-Respondent which contained 4 charges for including a casual Labourer by the name of

Somawathi into the check roll of rubber tappers and allowing her to work in his division as a tapper

without obtaining approval from the management (R-9A). There was evidence led before the tribunal

to the effect that in three months, i.e., in the months of July, August, and September her name was

included as a Tapper while she worked as a casual Labourer. According to the witnesses Applicant

being the most senior field officer of the Woodend division it was his responsibility to maintain

records correctly and allowing one Labourer to get an advantage against the Tappers employed by

the estate is illegal as per the instructions issued to the Field Officers (R-33). As per the domestic

inquiry proceedings which were produced marked R-11, evidence had been led at the inquiry that

when the employees attached to a division is insufficient, the field officers are permitted to use casual

Labourers with the permission of the management but no such permission had been obtained by the

Applicant-Respondent to obtain the services of casual laborer Somawathi as a tapper. However, on

several occasions, the Applicant-Respondent had obtained the services of Somawathi as a Tapper.

7

As observed by me, the President of the Labour Tribunal had correctly analyzed the evidence placed

before the Labour Tribunal by the above witnesses in detail and had concluded that the employer had

established the charges leveled against the Applicant-Respondent except for charge 2 in R-41A and

charge 3 in R-9A where the Applicant was found not guilty at the domestic inquiry.

When analyzing the evidence placed before the tribunal, the President was mindful of the matters

elicited by the Applicant in cross-examination of the witnesses, especially with regard to four

instances where field assistants namely Kamalaraj and Sureka entered the name of Somawathi as a

Tapper.

In his order, the President Labour Tribunal had considered this issue as follows;

As further observed by me, the President of the Labour Tribunal was mindful of the domestic inquiry

held against the Applicant-Respondent and had referred to the Domestic Inquiry proceedings

produced before him marked R-11 in his order. However, when concluding that the Applicant-

Respondent was guilty of the charges level against him except for charge 2 in R41A and charge 3 in R-

9A he had analyzed the evidence placed before him by the Respondents-Appellants at the Trial. He

has not considered evidence given by the witnesses with regard to two charges where the Applicant-

Respondent was discharged at the Domestic Inquiry. Therefore, it is clear that the President of the

Labour Tribunal was mindful that the Applicant-Respondent was found not guilty of two charges at

the Domestic Inquiry.

When the matter was appealed to the High Court by the Applicant, the learned High Court Judge had

analyzed the evidence placed before the Labour Tribunal and observed the following; (page11)

In a plain reading of the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it appears that he had restricted

his judgment to a few issues. As observed by me the main issue he considered was the different

treatment given to the Applicant as against two of his subordinates Kamalraj and Sureka. As already

referred to by me, the President of the Labour Tribunal had analyzed the evidence given by the

witnesses for the Respondents-Appellants in cross-examination, the documents produced in this

regard, and the evidence given by the Applicant on this issue and given his reasons for his conclusion.

In his judgment, the High Court Judge has further gone into the answers given by the key witnesses

with regard to the domestic inquiry. In this regard the High Court had further observed;

As already referred to by me, Labour Tribunal was mindful of the proceedings of the Domestic Inquiry

but, mainly relied on the evidence placed before the Labour Tribunal during the trial by both parties

with regard to the charges on which the Applicant was found guilty at the Domestic Inquiry.

The President of the Labour Tribunal when deciding the above issues, was guided by the evidence and

the documents placed before him. He had the advantage of observing the demeanor and the

deportment of the witnesses who testified before him. Therefore, he is the best judge who can decide

on the evidence placed before him Kotagala Plantations Ltd and another Vs. Ceylon Plantations

Society 2010 (2) Sri LR 299.

In appeal, our Courts are reluctant to interfere with the finding of the Trial Judge (including the

findings before the Labour Tribunal) unless the order is not supported by the evidence. The learned

High Court Judge is free to hold his view but, he needs to justify his findings. Jayasuriya Vs. Sri Lanka

State Plantation Corporation 1995 (2) Sri LR 379

As observed by this Court, High Court had overlooked the evidence led against the Applicant-

Respondent which was analyzed in detail by the Labour Tribunal but come to a different conclusion

10

based on matters that had been correctly analyzed by the Labour Tribunal as already referred to in

this Judgment.

For the reasons I have already referred to in this Judgment, I answer the first three questions of law

in the affirmative and it is sufficient to allow the appeal before this Court.

The appeal is allowed. I make no order with regard to costs.
