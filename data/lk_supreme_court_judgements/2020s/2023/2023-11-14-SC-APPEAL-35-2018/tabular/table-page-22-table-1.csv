"3) Payment of assessment rates"
"The relevant Defendants have proved with documentary evidence that the 1st/8A and"
"8th Defendants have paid assessment rates over the property since 1961 (at page 217-"
"220 of Brief) (1v9-1v41 at pages 411-447). The Galle Municipal Council has charged"
"municipal  council  rates  in  respect  of  the  premises  of  No.  65  (old)/No.  63  (new)"
"Pagngnaloka  Mawatha,  Welipitmodara,  Ginthota.  Thus,  the  relevant  Defendants"
"argue that the Municipal council had recognized that the 1st /8A Defendant and his"
"father  the  8th  Defendant  were  in  exclusive  occupation  of  the  highland  portion  on"
"which  their  ancestral  house  stood  and  the  entire  premises  was  assigned  a  number"
"with reference to the road that ran on the South-Eastern boundary of the corpus. It is"
"submitted  that  it  would  be  highly  artificial  to  hold  that  these  relevant  Defendants"
"alone have paid assessment rates to the Municipal Council for such a long period of"
"time while possessing the land in the capacity of co-owners."
"As was reiterated earlier, the settled law is that the possession of one co-owner is in"
"law the possession of the other co-owners. Therefore, the question that arises in this"
"case is whether from the uninterrupted sole possession of the 8th Defendant and his"
"predecessors in title, extending over a number of years and the conduct of the other"
"co-owners in not asserting any right to possess, a presumption of  ouster by the 8th"
"Defendant and his predecessors can be invoked and the commencement of adverse"
"possession by them can be presumed."
"Whether  the  presumption  of  ouster  is  to  be  drawn  or  not  would  depend  on  the"
"circumstances of the case. It was held in Abdul Majeed v. Ummu Zaneera 61 NLR 361"
"at page 381,"
