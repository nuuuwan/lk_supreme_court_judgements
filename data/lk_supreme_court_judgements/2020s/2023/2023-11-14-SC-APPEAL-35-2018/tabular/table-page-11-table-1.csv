"Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the relevant Defendants preferred an appeal to"
"the Civil Appellate High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle."
"The relevant Defendants did not dispute the findings of the District Court with respect"
"to the identification of the corpus, however they challenged the findings  relating to"
"the pedigree and in particular the findings with regard to prescriptive title."
"The Civil Appellate High Court delivered its judgment inter alia granting prescriptive"
"title  of  the  entirety  of  the  corpus  (Lot  A1  in  Plan  marked  Y1)  to  the  relevant"
"Defendants.  It  is  of  relevance  to  note  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judges  have"

"consider  the  respective  cases  of  both  the  Plaintiff  and  the  relevant  Defendants."
"However, the only issue that this Court has to consider is whether the said Defendants"
"have prescribed to the corpus of A1."
"Aggrieved  by  the  said  judgment  of  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  the  Plaintiff"
"appealed to this Court seeking relief. The Plaintiff however did not wish to challenge"
"the decisions of the District Court and High Court with regard to the identification of"
"the corpus."
"On 09.03.2018 Leave to Appeal was granted on questions of law referred to in sub"
"paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) in paragraph 17 of the petition dated 23.11.2016, which"
