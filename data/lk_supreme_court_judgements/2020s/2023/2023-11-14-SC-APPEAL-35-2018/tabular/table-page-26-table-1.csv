"Therefore, based on the evidence adduced by the relevant Defendants it cannot be said"
"that  there  is  proof  of  circumstances  from  which  a  reasonable  inference  could  be"
"drawn  that  such  possession  had  become  adverse  at  some  date  ten  years  before  the"
"action  was  brought  and would  justify  the Court  in  presuming  an  ouster.  Thus,  the"
"questions of law can be answered in the affirmative."
"Conclusion"
"In view of the aforementioned reasons, I answer the questions of law as follows;"
"(iii) Whether their Lordship the High Court Judges of Civil Appeal had misdirected"
"themselves by deciding the said Bantis acquired prescriptive title to the subject matter"
"as against the rest of the co-owners?"
"Yes"
"(iv) Whether their Lordship the High Court Judges of Civil Appeal had erred in law"
"by failing to appreciate the fact that the 1,2, and 8A respondents have not placed any"
"cogent  evidence  to  establish  act  of  ouster  which  enables  the  said  Bantis  to  claim"
"prescriptive title against the fellow co-owners?"
"Yes"
"(v)  Whether  their  Lordship  the  High  Court  Judges  of  Civil  Appeal  had  failed  to"
"appreciate the fact that in the absence of evidence to establish act of ouster the co-"
"owner cannot seek prescriptive title against the other co-owners merely relying on"
"exclusive possession?"
"Yes"
"Accordingly, the judgement of the High Court of Civil Appeals dated 13.10.2016 is"
"hereby  set-aside  and  the  judgement  of  the  District  Court  dated  2nd  April  2009  is"
"affirmed"
"The appellant is entitled for costs of this appeal"
