"rights of Karunawathie devolved on her siblings, while the rights of Sisilawathie had"
"on her death passed onto her husband the 6th Defendant."
"The  Plaintiff  in  lieu  of  deed  No.  12572  produced  ‘P1’,  a  Letter  issued  by  the  Land"
"Registry  stating  that  the  deed  has  perished.  The  document  marked  ‘P1’  does  not"
"contain  any  description  of  what  the  deed  contained  and  all  evidence  led  as  to  its"
"contents were from the Plaintiff herself."
"Thus,  the  relevant  Defendants  assert  that  there  is  no  valid  primary  or  secondary"
"evidence  led  with  regard  to  this  deed  and  the  extent  transferred  to  the  Plaintiff’s"
"predecessors.  In  order  to  substantiate  this  argument,  the  relevant  Defendants  have"
"highlighted the admission made by the Plaintiff when being cross-examined that she"
"did not know the contents of the deed nor the extent of rights transferred from the"
"original owner Mathes to her predecessor Saudiris (vide page 160-161 of the Brief)"
"as well as the Plaintiff’s  observation that the size of the land in deed No. 12752 was"
"larger than the size of the land in deed No. 15144 and deed No. 12751."
"On this basis the relevant Defendants take up the position that the Plaintiff has not"
"sufficiently  proved  that  she  has  title  over  the  corpus  and  therefore  has  no  basis  to"
"claim co-ownership."
"The Plaintiff asserts the fact that the parties to the action are co-owners of the property"
"sought  to  be  partitioned  by  indicating  that  during  cross-examination  the  1st/8A"
"Defendant specifically admitted the title of the Plaintiff to the corpus as set out in the"
"pedigree  (vide  page  261  of  the  Brief).  Furthermore,  the  Plaintiff  notes  that  in  the"
"relevant  Defendants  statement  of  claim  dated  31st  January  1997,  they  claim  rights"
"under  another  individual,  one  Theberis  and  admit  the  fact  that  Theberis  too  had"
"undivided rights to the corpus, which indicates that even the portion of land to which"
"they  claim  prescriptive  title  is  undivided.  Therefore,  on  behalf  of  the  Plaintiff  it  is"
"argued that the relevant Defendants have conceded the co-owned rights of the parties"
"to the land sought to be partitioned."
"In this instance it is noteworthy that when being cross-examined, 1st/ 8A Defendants"
"did admit to the fact that he is a co-owner to the corpus (vide page 255 of the Brief)."
"The  1st/8A  Defendants  also  admitted  that  Saudiris  received  rights  under  deed  No."
"12571 and that the Plaintiff received rights devolving from the original owner Mathes"
"(at page 262 of the Brief)."
