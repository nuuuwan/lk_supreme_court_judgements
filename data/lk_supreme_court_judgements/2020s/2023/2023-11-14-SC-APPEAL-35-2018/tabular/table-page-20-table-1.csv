"1) Long and continuous possession;"
"The relevant Defendants submit that the 8th Defendant, his  parents and his family,"
"have  been  in  possession  of  the  land  for  a  long  period  of  time  and  that  there  is  no"
"evidence of anyone else having ever possessed the land (vide page 212 of the Brief)."
"The 1st / 8A Defendant giving evidence stated that his family took up residence on the"
"land sought to be partitioned in 1947. However, he stated that he was residing in Ja-"
"ela during the time of the trial  and that his daughter was residing on the land. He"
"further stated that his mother Rosinahami, the 8A Defendant had resided on the land"
"from 1947 until her death in 2002."
"The Plaintiff giving evidence on 25th March 2002 admitted that she moved to the area"
"in which the land is situated 40 years ago but gave no evidence of having made any"
"claims  to  the  land  at  that  time.  The  Plaintiff  also  admitted  that  the corpus  was  the"
"ancestral property of the 8th Defendant and that apart the family of the 8th Defendant"
"no one else resided on the land (at page 154 of the Brief). In fact, the Plaintiff led no"
"evidence to show that her ancestors possessed the land."
"The  Plaintiff  denying  the exclusive  possession  of  the corpus  by  the  1st /8A  and 2nd"
"Defendants  and  their  predecessors,  claimed  that  her  predecessors  in  title  namely"
"Rensohami and Saudiris  exercised  their  rights  to  the land and that  Rensohami had"
"plucked fruits from the land. She further claimed that they were not allowed to enter"
"the land after the action was filed."
"Furthermore,  the  relevant  Defendants  state  that  the  paddy  field  and  owita  portion"
"depicted as Lot A2 and B in Plan Y1 were excluded from the corpus by both the District"
"Court and High Court on the ground that they had been exclusively possessed by the"
"1st/8A  and  2nd  Defendant  and  their  predecessors  in  title,  consequently  acquiring"
"prescriptive  title  thereto.  It  is  argued  that  from  a  logical  perspective  those  who"
"cultivated  the  paddy  and  owita  portion  would  have  naturally  first  resided  on  the"
"highland and then begun such cultivation."
"With respect to Lots A2 and B  in Plan Y1 called “Rathmehera Delgahawatte Owita"
"saha  Kumbura”  the  1st/8A  Defendant  claimed  that  his  father  the  8th  Defendant"
"cultivated the land with paddy and vegetables and was in possession of it till his death"
"at the age of 90 in 1992. The 1st /8A Defendant also claimed that on his father’s death,"
