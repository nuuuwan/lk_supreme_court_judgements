"The  1st /8A  Defendants  also  accepted  that  by  deed  No.  15144  Saudiris  transferred"
"rights to Ransohamy which then devolved on her six children including the Plaintiff."
"The argument made in that instance was that the Plaintiff was not entitled to the land"
"as those rights were never exercised by the Plaintiff nor her predecessor Ransohamy"
"(at page 264 of the Brief). Furthermore the 1st /8A and 2nd Defendants had in their"
"statement of claim dated 31st January 1997 in paragraph 23 stated that the two deeds"
"Nos. 12572 and 15144 referred to above on which the Plaintiff’s mother had acquired"
"rights had never been acted upon. As such the relevant Defendants have not denied"
"the two deeds and only state that they had not been acted upon."
"Despite  the  fact  that  deed  No.  12571  was  not  produced  as  evidence  due  to  its"
"unavailability, deed No. 15144 (marked ‘P2’) by which Saudiris conveys his rights to"
"the  corpus,  to  the  Plaintiff’s  mother  Rensohamy,  describes  deed  No.  12571.  The"
"validity of deed No. 15144 which is a legally executed document cannot be denied."
"Therefore, the devolution of title as set out by the Plaintiff cannot be disregarded and"
"the inference that can be drawn is that Saudiris had gifted the undivided rights he"
"received with respect to the corpus, under deed No. 12751 to Rensohamy by way of"
"deed No. 15144."
"Prescriptive title"
"The Plaintiff’s pedigree is based on three deeds, deeds No. 12571, 12572, 12573 all"
"dated 13th March 1894."
"According to the Plaintiff, the original owner also conveyed an undivided 13/24 share"
"of the corpus to one Theberis by Deed No. 12573 dated 13th March 1894. This deed"
"has not been produced and instead a letter issued by the Land Registry indicating that"
"it has been decayed was submitted as evidence (marked 7V1)."
"As  per  the  Plaintiff’s  pedigree,  Theberis  had  then  by  Deed  No.  13705  dated  24th"
"February 1919 (7V2) sold a 15/48 share to Lankapurage Juanis who then conveyed"
"this share to Hikkaduwage Ijo under Deed No. 10328 dated 4th July 1919 (7V3). The"
"said Ijo was married to Theberis and together they had an undivided 13/24 share."
"They had 6 children, the 7th Defendant Francina, the 8th Defendant Bantis, Siyadoris,"
"Sampy, Aminona, and Danister and on their deaths their rights devolved on their six"
"heirs. The shares of Sampy, Aminona, and Danister who died unmarried and issueless"
"devolved on Siyadoris and the 7th and 8th Defendants. Siyadoris by Deed No. 12881"
