"he came into possession of that portion of land and after having left the area to take"
"up residence in Katunayake, he came to inspect that portion at least once a month. It"
"is argued that the paddy and owita portion was a necessary adjunct of the highland"
"portion and the fact that they were excluded from the corpus further established the"
"fact  that  unless  the  1st/8A  and  2nd  Defendants  and  their  predecessors  exclusively"
"possessed  the  highland  as  their  ancestral  property  they  could  not  have  acquired"
"prescriptive title to the paddy and owita portion (Lots A2 and B of Plan Y1). Thus, the"
"relevant Defendants argue that their long, continuous possession  of the corpus  has"
"been established."
"2) No claim to the improvements and plantations;"
"Apart from the relevant Defendants, neither the Plaintiff nor the other Defendants had"
"any claim to the improvements and plantations on the corpus."
"According to the Surveyor’s Reports marked X1 and Y3, Lot A1 consists of a house"
"marked No.01, a kitchen marked No. 02, a latrine marked No.3, and two wells marked"
"No. 4 and No. 5 which were all exclusively claimed by the 1st/8A Defendant without"
"any dispute."
"The Plaintiff had only claimed that the plantations which are older the 75 years and"
"that too was not for herself but as belonging the soil. The relevant Defendants argue"
"that the inference that can be drawn from the fact that the Plaintiff makes no claim"
"with respect to the plantations which are less than 75 years is that neither she nor her"
"predecessors in title have been in possession of the corpus for that long."
"The District  Court  categorically  rejected  the  Plaintiff’s  claim  to  the plantations and"
"held  that  all  the  improvements  and  plantations  on  the  corpus  A1  belonged  to  the"
"1st/8A and 8th Defendants based on the evidence that they were located on the land"
"(A1) which the 8th Defendant and his family possessed, resided on and cultivated for"
"an extended duration of time. It is also noteworthy that this finding was not appealed"
"against by the Plaintiff or the other Defendants to the High Court.  Thus, having made"
"no claims to any cultivation on the land for least 75 years, it is argued that it is hugely"
"artificial for the Plaintiff to claim that the relevant Defendants had been in possession"
"of the land in the capacity of co-owners."
