Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ

This Court had granted special leave to appeal to respondents-appellants from the judgement of the

Court of Appeal dated 15.05.2019. The three petitioners-respondents had invoked the jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal on 02nd April 2013 seeking inter alia a writ of certiorari to quash the decision

of 1st, 2nd 4th and 5th to 10th respondents-appellants, to call applications from Sri Lanka Homeopathy

degree holders and diploma holders for registration as new Homeopathy practitioners. An

advertisement published in print media by the Registrar of the Homeopathy Medical Council was

produced marked P8. Furthermore, petitioners-respondents sought a writ of Mandamus directing the

respondent-appellants to publish an advertisement cancelling the aforesaid impugned advertisement

P8. Two other reliefs sought by the petitioner-respondents from the Court of Appeal against the

aforesaid respondents-appellants were writs of prohibition preventing them from registering new

Homeopathic practitioners and usurping powers and authority of the Homeopathic Council.

Furthermore, they sought interim orders restraining the respondents-appellants from calling

applications for registration as new homeopathic practitioners and doing any act incidental to and

connected with calling said applications and / or making decisions and implementing them until the

final determination of the application.

In the aforesaid application, the Minister in charge of Indigenous Medicine, the Secretary of the

Ministry of Indigenous Medicine and Secretary of the Homeopathic Council were the 1st, 2nd and 4th

respondents respectively. While the members of the Homeopathic Interim Control Committee were

cited as 5th to the 9th respondents and the Homeopathic Interim Control Committee was cited as the

10th respondent.

Petitioners-respondents are registered practitioners of homeopathy and they invoked the jurisdiction

of the Court of Appeal on the basis that the aforementioned respondents-appellants have usurped the

powers and authority of the Homeopathic Council, established under the provisions of the

Homeopathy Act No 7 of 1970. Petitioners-respondents further claimed that 5th to 9th respondents

named before the Court of Appeal are not members of the Homeopathic Council recognised by the

Act, but of an Interim Control Committee appointed by the Minister. It was contended that the

Minister had no power to appoint such committee and the committee has no power to register

Homeopathic medical practitioners. They contended that it is the Homeopathic Medical Council who

has the power to register new practitioners as provided under section 16(3) of the Homeopathy Act.

7

The Court of Appeal by its judgement dated 15.05.2019, allowed the application of the petitioner-

respondents and granted reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the petition.

Respondents-appellants sought special leave to appeal from this court and three intervenient

petitioners sought to intervene. This court at the hearing of the special leave to appeal application of

the respondentappellants had also considered the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the three intervenient-petitioners when granting special leave to appeal on six questions of law,

including the following question framed by the intervenient-petitioners:

Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to hear the intervenient-petitioners prior to its judgement

dated 15.05.2019?

Four of the five remaining questions of law relate to the legality of the impugned judgment of the

Court of Appeal.

It is pertinent to note that the decisions the petitioners-respondents challenged in the Court of Appeal

were made in 2013 and the judgement was delivered in the year 2019. The learned Deputy Solicitor-

General at the outset of the hearing of this appeal submitted that the interim committee, whose

decision was impugned in the Court of Appeal ceased to function and a council appointed under the

provisions of the new Homeopathy Act, which came in to operation in 2016, is performing necessary

duties, at present. Furthermore the said council had endorsed the registration of the intervenient-

petitioners as homeopathy practitioners. In view of these changes due to intervenient factors, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the challenge to the Court of Appeal judgment

based on the initial questions of law is an academic exercise and therefore he would confine himself

to the sole legal question set out below:

Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to hear the Intervenient Petitioners prior to its judgment dated

15th May 2019, and if so, whether the judgment dated 15th May 2019 could have an adverse impact

on the intervenient petitioners and / or any others who are similarly circumstanced?

Accordingly all parties agreed to pursue this matter based on the above question of law and restrict

their respective cases to focus on the said question.

Before I proceed to examine the submissions on this legal issue I would first set out briefly the

factual background as revealed by the material presented before this court.

8

Under the provisions of Homeopathy Act No 7 of 1970, a council called Homeopathic Council is

established. During the period of first ten years commencing on the appointed date, the Minister had

the power to appoint the members of the council and thereafter they are to be elected by the

homeopathic practitioners registered under the Act. Powers of the council includes the power to

register homeopathic practitioners. All the members of the council hold office for a term of five

years and a member is deemed to have vacated from office on his removal by the Minister.

In the year 2006, a council had been elected and on 20th October 2009, the Minister had removed

the members of the said council. Thereafter the Minister had appointed an interim committee and the

term of office of the said interim committee came to an end on 30th January 2011. Thereafter, on 28th

March 2011, having considered a memorandum submitted by the Minister, the cabinet of ministers

had decided that action be taken in consultation with the Attorney-General. Thereafter, acting on the

opinion of the Attorney-General, the Minister had appointed several interim committees. One such

committee had been appointed with effect from 1st January 2013, and it is this committee that took

steps to call for applications to register homeopathic practitioners. On 19th November 2013,

petitioners-respondents challenged this decision and invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal. However, the said interim committee had ceased to hold office at the end of 2013 and a

fresh interim committee had been appointed thereafter. On 4th December 2015, a gazette was

published setting out the names of all registered homeopathic practitioners. In the following year a

new Act had come in to force (Homeopathy Act No 10 of 2016) and on 7th November 2016 a council

comprising of eleven members had been appointed in accordance with the provisions of the said Act.

The petitioners-respondents on 29th August 2017 had filed an amended petition in the Court of

Appeal pleading inter alia that they are entitled to and / or there are compelling reasons to maintain

and continue with the application. Thereafter the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal was

delivered on 15 May 2019. It is also pertinent at this stage to note that the Court of Appeal when

granting notices had refused granting interim relief prayed by the petitioners-respondents to restrain

the respondents-petitioners calling applications for registration as new homeopathic practitioners and

doing any act incidental to and connected with calling said applications and / or making decisions

and implementing them.

9

The learned Presidents Counsel for the three intervenient petitioners submitted, that they in

response to the advertisement P8, submitted applications to register themselves as homeopathic

practitioners and obtained registration on or around 07th August 2013. Thereafter, on or around 18th

May 2019 the Registrar of the 3rd Respondent-Petitioner Council informed that their registration

would be cancelled as per the impugned judgement of the Court of Appeal dated 15th May 2019.

He further submitted that the basis or the reason for said decision by the registrar of the council

could be attributed to a specific finding of the Court of Appeal in the impugned judgment dated 15th

May 2019. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal having granted relief prayed by the petitioner-

respondents, further proceeded to hold:

Learned Senior DSG for the respondents in his written submissions seeks to dismiss the petitioners

application on futility on the basis that five new homeopathy practitioners were registered in

response to the advertisement P8 pending determination of this application. That registration of five

new members is on the above-mentioned principle of law (is) a nullity.

On behalf of the intervenient-petitioners it was contended that they themselves and others who are

similarly circumstanced are truly aggrieved by the impugned judgement, as their registration had

been adversely affected without granting a hearing for them. They contend that they were necessary

parties for the application and the failure on the part of the petitioners-respondents to name them as

respondents is a fatal irregularity.

The registrar of the homeopathic council by the gazette No 1944 dated 05th December 2015, a copy

of which is produced before this court by the intervenient-petitioners, had published the names of the

registered homeopathic practitioners under the title list of homeopathy practitioners-general

register-2014. The said list contains two hundred and sixty one names including the three

intervenient-petitioners. They are listed as 194, 195 and 197. The three petitioners-respondents are

listed in the same list as 114,115 and 125. It is also pertinent to observe that the registrar of the

homeopathic council had published a similar list of registered practitioners in the gazette no 1350

dated 16 July 2004 under the title list of homeopathic practitioners 2003 and the names of the

three respondents-petitioners appear under the same sequential numbers. The three petitioners-

respondents had produced a copy of this gazette along with their petition when invoking the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

10

In this context it is pertinent to observe that the petitioners-respondents neither in their original

petition dated 02nd April 2013 nor in the amended petition dated 29th August 2017 had prayed for the

cancellation of any registration granted pursuant to the impugned advertisement P8. However, they

sought interim orders restraining the respondents-petitioners from calling applications for

registration as new homeopathy practitioners and registering them under the provisions of the Act as

well as directing the Secretary of the homeopathic council to publish an advertisement cancelling the

impugned advertisement marked P8, but were not successful as the Court of Appeal did not grant

such interim relief.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General while associating himself with the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the intervenient petitioners submitted, that a motion with a copy of a letter of

the Registrar of the homeopathic council confirming the registration of five persons out of twenty

persons who submitted applications in response to the impugned advertisement P8, as registered

homeopathy practitioners, together with an extract of the gazette dated 04.12.2015 which contains

the names of the intervenient petitioners and the date of their registration namely 07th August 2013,

was filed in the Court of Appeal on 17th December 2018. Furthermore, it was contended that the

written submissions filed on behalf of the respondents-petitioners in the Court of Appeal on 01st

March 2019, categorically drew the attention of the court to the fact that five qualified homeopathic

practitioners have been selected from among twenty applicants who responded to the impugned

advertisement and that their names were published in the gazette dated 04th December 2015. In the

aforementioned written submissions it had been contended that the writ application should fail inter

alia on the ground of futility and due to the failure to sight necessary parties as respondents.

However, the learned judge of the Court of Appeal in his judgment dated 15th May 2019 had

restricted his consideration to the submission on futility, in deciding to grant the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer. Therefore, it is further contended that the learned judge of the court of appeal erred in

holding that the registration of five new members a nullity while granting reliefs prayed in the

petition as he failed to consider the submission on the failure to sight necessary parties.

Both the learned Presidents Counsel for the intervenient petitioners as well as the learned Deputy

Solicitor General submitted that the finding on the validity of the registration of the intervenient

petitioners without affording them an opportunity to present their case violates the core principles on

fair adjudication namely audi alteram partem a cardinal rule of natural justice. Therefore, they

contend that the revised question of law should be answered in the affirmative.

11

The learned counsel for the petitioners-respondents contests the above positions of the respondents-

appellants and intervenient petitioners. He contended that the legal question should be answered in

the negative and the cases of respondents-petitioners as well as intervenient petitioners should be

dismissed. It is his contention that the respondents-appellants and intervenient petitioners by

restricting the scope of the appeal to the sole question of law and thereby abandoning the appeal on

the rest of the questions of law have left two main conclusions of the Court of Appeal intact. It is his

position that no person should be allowed to be benefitted from an illegal act and the attempt of the

intervenient petitioners to derive benefit from illegality should fail. He claims while the two main

findings of the Court of Appeal that the appointment of the interim committee by the minister is

ultravires and that the decisions made by the purported Interim Committee are null and void ab

initio remain unchallenged, registration of the intervenient petitioners as homeopathic practitioners

has no force in law, even though they were not accorded a hearing in the Court of Appeal.

Furthermore, he submits that the intervenient petitioners cannot possibly claim that they were

unaware of the case pending in the court of appeal challenging the legality of the interim committee

by the Minister. and therefore they should have acted with precautions.. Furthermore, he

submits that they are not without remedy as they could obtain registration under the provisions of the

Homeopathy Act no. 10 of 2016.

As I have enumerated herein before, the scope of this appeal was restricted to a solitary question of

law on the basis that arguing the full appeal is only an academic exercise, due to the subsequent

changes. Therefore both the learned Deputy Solicitor-General as well as the learned Presidents

Counsel for the intervenient petitioners confined their challenge to the specific finding of the

impugned judgment that directly adversely affected the intervenient petitioners. Therefore the sole

issue before this court is whether the learned judge of the Court of Appeal erred when he proceeded

to hold that registration of five new members is on the above mentioned principle of law is a

nullity without according a hearing to the said five new members who were registered by the

interim committee.

The registration of these five new members had taken place on 07 August 2013 and by that time

there was no judicial pronouncement on the legality of the interim committee. Furthermore, the

Court of Appeal had declined issuing an interim order to restrain the respondents-petitioners from

calling for applications for registration as new homeopathic practitioners and proceeding to register

12

them or doing any act incidental or connected with calling said applications or making decisions and

implementing them.

The Supreme Court in Gnanasambanthan v Rear Admiral Perera and others [1998] 3 SLR 167 at

172 observed that ..it is both the law and practice in Sri Lanka to cite necessary parties to

applications for Writs of Certiorary and Mandamus.

In Rawaya Publishers and other v Wijedasa Rajapaksha, Chairman Sri lanka Press Council &

Others [2001] 3 SLR 213 at 216, Justice J.A.N.De Silva, President Court of Appeal (as he then was)

citing with approval Udit Narayan Singh v Board of Revenue, AIR 1963 SC 786, observed that:

it has been held that where a writ application is filed in respect of an order of the Board of

Revenue not only the Board it self is a necessary party, but also the parties in whose favour

the Board has pronounced the impugned decision because without them no effective decision

can be made. If they are not made parties then the petition can be dismissed in limine. It has

also been held that persons vitally affected by the writ petition are all necessary parties.

In Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v Ven. Dr Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero et al

[2011] 2 SLR 258 at 267 the Supreme Court while examining the rules governing the issue of

necessary parties to an action observed that;

the second rule is that those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ application

should be made respondents to the application.

The Court further elaborated

A necessary party to an application for a writ of mandamus is the officer or the authority

who has the power vested by law to perform the act or the duty sought to be enforced by the

writ of mandamus. All persons who would be affected by the issue of mandamus also shall be

made respondents to the application (at 268).

In the matter before us, one of the reliefs sought by the petitioners-respondents is a Writ of

Mandamus directing the respondents to publish an advertisement cancelling the impugned

advertisement calling for applications to register new homeopathic practitioners and the Court of

Appeal granted the said relief too. Three intervenient petitioners who gained registration based on

the applications submitted in response to the said impugned advertisement are therefore necessary

13

parties to the said application. They had gained such registration within a period of just over four

months of filing the application in the Court of Appeal by the petitioners-respondents. There had

been a period of five years between the intervenient petitioners gaining registration and final

submissions in the Court of Appeal. Such submissions had been made three years after the

publication of the list of practitioners in 2015 that contained inter alia the names of the new

practitioners who gained registration in 2013. It is also pertinent to observe that the petitioners-

respondents filed an amended petition in the Court of Appeal, two years after the publication of the

gazette, but opted not to add the practitioners who were registered in 2013 in consequent to the

impugned advertisement. Petitioners-respondents failed to provide a valid explanation on their

failure to add new practitioners other than the mere assertion that they were unaware of such

registration. In my view this assertion is far from truth. It is clear that the publication of the list of

practitioners is not unusual. Petitioners-respondents themselves produced the publication in 2004

containing 178 names. Their explanation, the claim of ignorance on the publication of list of

practitioners in 2015, at a time they had invoked jurisdiction of a court of law challenging the

registration of new practitioners is unacceptable. Filing of the amended petition in 2017

demonstrates that the petitioners-respondents had been vigilant on the changes that had been taking

place in relation to matters surrounding the litigation they initiated in 2013. It is also interesting to

note that apart from the five persons who had been registered in August 2013, sixty five new persons

had been registered in the following year 2014 and the publication in 2015 contains all persons

who have been registered between the time the petitioners-respondents invoked the jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal and December 2015. This increase had taken place within the space of two years

in a background there were only one hundred and ninety-two persons who had been registered

between the years 1982 and 2011. When all these facts are taken cumulatively, the ignorance

pleaded by the petitioners-respondents on the registration of three intervenient-petitioners by 2017,

is unacceptable.

Respondent-petitioners having failed to discharge their responsibility to add necessary parties take

up the position that the intervenient-petitioners should be denied of any relief by this court as they

failed to intervene in the Court of Appeal. It is the contention of the petitioners-respondents that the

intervenient-petitioners who gained registration in 2013 performed certain functions associated with

the interim committee and therefore they ought to have known about the proceedings pending in the

Court of Appeal. However, there is no proof as to the exact nature of interaction the intervenient-

14

petitioners maintained with the interim committee. Furthermore, there were no interim reliefs

granted by the court. Petitioners-respondents further submitted that there is no bar for the

intervenient-petitioners to seek registration under the 2016 Act, after satisfying that they possess

necessary qualifications and hence they are not without any remedy.

Aforesaid contentions of the petitioners-respondents neither absolve them from the responsibility

they shoulder nor valid explanations for their lapse. In my view requiring the intervenient petitioners

to recommence the registration process under the 2016 Act, causes nothing but an unnecessary and

unwarranted burden on them. In this regard it is pertinent to observe that the qualifications the

intervenient-petitioner posses are set out in the petition, affidavit and annexures of the intervention

application filed in this court and they are not disputed. Furthermore, it is pertinent to observe that in

August 2013 out of twenty applicants, only four had been successful gaining registration.

Petitioners-respondents do not claim that the intervenient petitioners do not possess required

qualifications. The learned Deputy Solicitor-General submitted that the newly constituted

homeopathic council, under the provisions of 2016 Act had already decided to ratify all the

registrations previously made.

It is also pertinent to observe that the learned judge of the Court of Appeal has made reference to the

findings of the Supreme Court in its judgment in SC FR 891/2009 and had relied on it when he

proceeded to observe that the registration of five new members in consequent to impugned P8

advertisement is a nullity. In my view it is necessary to examine the facts and circumstances based

on which SC FR 891/2009 had been instituted to decide the relevancy of its judgment to the matters

under consideration in the Court of Appeal. In 2006, members to the homeopathic council had been

elected for a period of five years. However, in 2009 the Minister had removed them and had

appointed an interim committee. The members who were removed by the Minister had invoked the

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in SC FR 891/2009 and had challenged their removal. Meanwhile

the term of the interim committee that was appointed in 2009 had come to an end in 2011. Thereafter

several interim committees had been appointed until the enactment of the new Homeopathy Act in

2016. The impugned Advertisement P8 had been published on a decision of one such interim

committee. The said committee had functioned from 01st January 2013 till end of the year and a new

committee had been appointed thereafter. Therefore the scope of the instant writ application is

limited to the decisions of the said interim committee appointed on 01st January 2013. The

appointment of the members to the 2013 interim committee took place at a time there was no judicial

15

pronouncement on the initial removal of the members in 2009. Furthermore, the appointment of

members to the interim committee in 2013 was not a matter that was impugned in SC FR 891/2009.

The said judgment that was pronounced in March 2016 focused on the removal of members in 2009

and the appointment of the interim committee in the same year. The learned Deputy Solicitor-

General submitted that the scope of the said judgment does not extend to the subsequent

appointments of several interim committees, including the interim committee appointed in 2013 in

consequent to a cabinet decision and on the advise of the Attorney-General.

When all these factors are considered in the backdrop of the failure on the part of the petitioners-

respondents to add necessary parties to the application parties who were directly affected from the

impugned judgment - the intervenient-petitioners and who are similarly circumstanced - and the fact

that they were denied a hearing before the Court of Appeal prior to the impugned judgment was

delivered together with the fact that the learned judge of the Court of Appeal failed to consider this

issue even though it was specifically raised, I am of the view, that the Court of Appeal erred in

failing to hear the Intervenient Petitioners prior to its judgement dated 15th May 2019 and therefore

the aforesaid judgement dated 15th May 2019 could not have an adverse impact on the

Intervenient Petitioners and /or any others who are similarly circumstanced. Hence, the impugned

judgement of the Court of Appeal dated 15th May 2019, is varied accordingly.

We make no order on costs.
