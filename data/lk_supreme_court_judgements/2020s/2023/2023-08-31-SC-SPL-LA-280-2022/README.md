Judgment

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J

Heard learned counsel for the Appellant and learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the Hon. Attorney General.

The Appellant stood indicted for having on 14th December 2009 in Maradana

committed the Murder of one Hewagamage Thilakaratne, and for having caused

hurt to one A.H.M. Thamara Kumari. The High Court convicted the Accused-

Appellant for having committed both offences. The Court of Appeal affirmed the

conviction and sentence.

SC.SPL.LA. 280/22

The Incident:

The Appellant worked in a small boutique which was a restaurant situated in

Maradana, and the deceased being the proprietor of the restaurant slept in the rear

of that place along with his wife (injured victim). The evidence reveal that the

Appellant was an employee of the deceased and the deceased had not being

regularly paying the Appellant his wages. During the evening of the day of the

incident, having booked a bus journey to proceed home on a bus which was due to

depart at 12 midnight that day, the Appellant had returned to his place of

employment to obtain his wages from his employer (the deceased). Around mid

night, he appears to have woken- up the deceased, and asked for his wages. The

deceased had refused pay the wages due to the Appellant. It is the Accused’s

evidence under oath (which testimony has not been successfully impeached by the

prosecution), that an argument ensued, and the deceased slapped him. The

Accused got angry and had retaliated by stabbing and cutting the deceased with

the aid of a knife used for cooking, which had been nearby along with other

cooking utensils. This incident had occurred at about 1.30am, and by that time the

accused had missed the bus in which he was due to go home.

Circumstances taken into consideration:

1. The deceased has sustained 11 cut injuries and 8 stab injuries, of which

four had been fatal, and one had been necessarily fatal. It appears that

the Appellant had within a brief moment of time acted in a rage and

inflicted all these injuries on the deceased. This is clearly reflective of

the accused having lost self-control.

2. During the course of this incident, the accused had sustained 8

injuries, the infliction of which has not been explained as part of the

5

SC.SPL.LA. 280/22

prosecution’s narrative of evidence. The wife of the deceased who claimed to

be an eyewitness does not explain how the accused sustained injuries.

3. There is no evidence that the Appellant had from outside brought into

the scene of the incident the knife that was used to inflict the fatal

injuries, or that he had previously surreptitiously kept the knife at the

location of the scene so that he could use it subsequently to inflict

injury on the deceased. This shows that the Appellant who had got

angry sequel to the deceased refusing to pay his wages and thereafter

slapping him, quite spontaneously took the knife which was nearby

and stabbed the deceased.

4. The accused is an uneducated, unskilled labourer from the lower

strata of society. His susceptibility to provocation would have been

quite high. Furthermore, there is no evidence of premeditation of

committing murder.

All these items suggest unequivocally to the accused having been provoked by

the deceased, and having lost control of himself and got into a rage and

attacked the deceased.

Finding:

In view of the above circumstances, this Court concludes that the

accused had been suddenly and gravely provoked by the deceased, at

the time he attacked the deceased.

In the circumstances, this Court while answering the two questions of

law in the affirmative, arrives at the conclusion that the conduct of the

Accused- Appellant comes within the purview of exception 1 to

6

SC.SPL.LA. 280/22

section 294 of the Penal Code and that the infliction of injury on the

deceased by the accused had been at a time when the Appellant was

deprived of the power self-control due to grave and sudden

provocation, and thereby he caused the death of the person who

gave such provocation. I have considered and concluded that none of

to the provisos of the 1st exception would be applicable to this case.

It is unfortunate that the Appellant’s case had not been presented

before the Court of Appeal in a manner that would have enabled that

Court to have considered his culpability from the perspective of the 1st

exception to section 294. Had it been done, in all probability, the Court

of Appeal would have also arrived at this same finding.

In the circumstances, this Court vacates and sets aside the impugned

judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 14.09.2022 and the Judgment

of the High Court dated 25.07.2019 and substitute therefor a verdict

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of the 1st

exception to section 294. Accordingly, a sentence of 20 years

imprisonment (which sentence shall operate from the date of the

original conviction imposed by the High Court) is imposed on the

Appellant.

The conviction and the sentence with regard to the 2nd count to shall

remain the same.

Accordingly, this Appeal is partly allowed.

This Court wishes to take of this opportunity to appreciate the highly

professional, thorough and persistent manner in which learned

7

SC.SPL.LA. 280/22

counsel for the Appellant pursued this appeal on behalf of his client.

This Court also wishes to place on record its appreciation of the

submissions that were made by learned Deputy Solicitor General in his

capacity as an officer of this Court and as representative counsel for

the Hon. Attorney General. He placed before this Court the true facts

of this case in a fair manner, and assisted Court in the dispensation of

justice. His conduct is in line with the traditions and the ethical

standards of true officers of the Attorney General’s Department.
