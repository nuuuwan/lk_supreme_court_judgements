Samayawardhena, J.

According to the amended plaint, the plaintiff filed action in the District

Court against the two defendants seeking declarations/orders that the 1st

and/or the 2nd defendant are holding the property in trust for the plaintiff;

and/or the 1st and/or the 2nd defendant are holding the property as

security obtained for a loan in a sum of Rs. 500,000 (from the Dedigama

Group); to retransfer the property in the name of the plaintiff; Deed No.

1096 marked P3 is a fraudulent Deed; and Deed No. 1387 marked P4 is a

nullity. The defendants filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs

action.

The case for the plaintiff is that she borrowed a sum of Rs. 500,000 from

the Dedigama Group in May 1996 and the property in suit and another

property were mortgaged as security for the loan. After payment of the

money borrowed in August 1996, the Deed in relation to the other property

4 SC/APPEAL/32/2019

(Deed No. 17) was returned to her but not the Deed in relation to the

property in suit (Deed No. 252 marked P1 whereby the plaintiff became

the owner). The plaintiff has made a complaint to the police in this regard

which has been marked P2.

The plaintiff in her evidence says that, after the discussion with Ranjan

Dedigama and Podi Nilame of the Dedigama Group, she was taken to a

notarys office and therein her signatures were obtained to blank papers

after being told that the transaction was a mortgage and not a sale. This

has happened before the money was lent to the plaintiff.

According to Deed No. 1096 marked P3 (the impugned Deed), the land in

suit has purportedly been transferred by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant

on 18.09.1997 for a sum of Rs. 150,000. The plaintiff categorically denies

this. The 1st defendant was a female employee of the Dedigama Group at

that time. According to the plaintiff, she has never spoken to her at any

time let alone sold the land to the 1st defendant. Thereafter the 1st

defendant has transferred this land to the 2nd defendant by Deed No. 1387

marked P4. The 2nd defendant at that time was a superintendent of police.

After trial, the learned District Judge, particularly by answering issues No.

2 and 12, had come to the findings that (a) the Deed of Transfer P3 had

been executed in favour of the 1st defendant who was an employee of the

Dedigama Group when the land was in fact mortgaged to the Dedigama

Group as security to a loan (b) there were no dealings by the 1st defendant

with the plaintiff prior to the execution of the purported Deed of Transfer

P3, and P3 was not a Deed executed on valuable consideration. I read the

evidence led at the trial before the District Court and I am fully convinced

that the said findings are correct.

However the learned District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs action

primarily on the basis that the plaintiff made a fundamental mistake by

5 SC/APPEAL/32/2019

tendering an amended plaint by removing the names of Ranjan Dadigama,

his employee Podi Nilame and Notary Walisundara as parties to the case.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, only the plaintiff

preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal. The defendants did

not appeal against the said adverse findings of the District Court. The High

Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and directed the District

Court to enter the judgment for the plaintiff. I take the view that the

conclusion of the High Court is correct.

The 2nd defendant came before this Court against the judgment of the High

Court. This Court has granted leave to appeal on several questions

(Paragraphs (b) to (f) of the petition). The first question is whether the High

Court misdirected itself in failing to consider that the plaintiff had failed

to prove that Deed P3 was a forged Deed or executed on misrepresentation.

As I have already stated, this is the finding of the District Judge, against

which there was no appeal. The High Court only fortified or rather affirmed

that finding. This question shall be answered in the negative. The third

question is whether the High Court misdirected itself by placing the

burden on payment of consideration on the defendants. The finding of the

learned District Judge is that consideration on Deed P3 was not paid by

the 1st defendant to the plaintiff. There was no appeal against this finding.

The High Court merely affirmed it. The finding of the learned District

Judge is correct.

I accept that the High Court further says that consideration on Deed P4

was also not paid by the 2nd defendant to the 1st defendant. I think that

finding is unwarranted. Even the 1st defendant does not say so. The

learned District Judge does not say that Deed P4 is a forgery. I set aside

that finding of the High Court and affirm the finding of the District Court

on Deed P4. However, whether or not Deed P4 is a forgery is immaterial.

If Deed P3 is a forgery, Deed P4 executed based on P3 is a nullity. The 2nd

6 SC/APPEAL/32/2019

defendant-appellant may seek relief against the 1st defendant, if so

advised.

In view of the above findings, there is no necessity to answer the other

questions raised by the 2nd defendant-appellant.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
