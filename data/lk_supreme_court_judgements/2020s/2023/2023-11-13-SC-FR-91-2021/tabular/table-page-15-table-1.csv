"objectives  of  the  Regulations.  Regulation  2  is  inherently  illogical  and"
"irrational. It reads thus:"
"The objective of these regulations shall be to ensure, that any person"
"who  surrenders  or  is  taken  into  custody  on  suspicion  of  being  a"
"person  who  by  words  either  spoken  or  intended  to  be  read  or  by"
"signs or by visible representations or otherwise, causes or intends"
"to  cause  commission  of  acts  of  violence  or  religious,  racial  or"
"communal  disharmony  or  feelings  of  ill  will  or  hostility  between"
"different communities or racial or religious groups after the coming"
"into operation of these regulations is dealt with in accordance with"
"the provisions of the Act, and that persons who have surrendered or"
"have been taken into custody in terms of any emergency regulation"
"which was in force at any time prior to coming into operation of these"
"regulations, continue in terms of these regulations, to enjoy the same"
"care and protection which they were previously enjoying."
