"the protection of public health or morality, or for the purpose of securing"
"due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others, or of"
"meeting  the  just  requirements  of  the  general  welfare  of  a  democratic"
"society."
"Article  170  defines  “law”  to  encompass  any  Act  of  Parliament,  laws"
"enacted by any legislature before the commencement of the Constitution,"
"and also includes an Order in Council."
"Both 15(1) and 15(7) state that for the purposes of those two paragraphs,"
"“law” includes regulations made under the law for the time being relating"
"to public security."
"Learned counsel for the petitioners especially relying on Thavaneethan v."
"Attorney General [2003] 1 Sri LR 74 argue that “regulations made under"
"the law for the time being relating to public security” means “Regulations"
"made  under  the  law  for  the  time  being  relating  to  the  Public  Security"
"Ordinance”  and  therefore  the  restrictions  placed  on  the  fundamental"
"rights  by  the  Regulations  made  under  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism"
"(Temporary Provisions) Act are against the Constitution and the rule of"
"law."
"The learned Additional Solicitor General, for reasons best known to him,"
"avoided  addressing  this  argument  by  asserting  that  “the 
impugned"
"Regulations do not restrict any fundamental rights of the petitioner or any"
"other  persons.  As  such,  the  respondents  do  not  seek  to  engage  in  the"
"redundant  exercise  of  relying  on  the  applicability  of  Article  15(7)  of  the"
"Constitution and thereby attempt to interpret the said Regulations as “law”"
"within the meaning of that provision.” It is rather naive to submit that the"
"impugned regulations do not restrict any fundamental rights when they"
"obviously do."
