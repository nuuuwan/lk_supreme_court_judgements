"ones  that  extend  to  the  collective  citizenry  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  very"
"notion 
that 
the  organs  of  government  are  expected 
to  act 
in"
"accordance  with  the  best 
interests  of  the  People  of  Sri  Lanka,"
"necessitates a determination that any one of the People of Sri Lanka"
"may seek redress in instances where a violation is believed to have"
"occurred. To hold otherwise would deprive the citizenry from seeking"
"accountability  of  the  institutions  to  which  it  has  conferred  great"
"power and to allow injustice to be left unchecked solely because of"
"technical  shortcomings.  This  position 
is  consistent  with  several"
"instances where this Court has held standing to be adequate."
