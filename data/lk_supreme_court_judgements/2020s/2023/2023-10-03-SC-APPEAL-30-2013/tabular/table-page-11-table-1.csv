"of the Plaintiff and the 1st to 5th Defendants, who is not a party to the action, acquired title by"
"prescription. Even in Punchi Rala v Andris Appuhami (1886) 3 SCR 149, it was held that it is not"
"competent  for  a  party  to  set  up  a  third  person’s  title  under  section  3  of  the  Prescription"
"ordinance. It is stated in the judgment that the Prescription Ordinance contemplates possession"
"by a party getting judgment, a plaintiff, a defendant or intervenient, - his own possession or that"
"of his predecessors in title and it is to be a judgment declaratory of the right of property in a party"
"to the action. [In this regard also see K. D. Edwin Peeris v Kirilamaya 71 NLR 52, Terunnanse v"
"Menike 1 NLR 200, Timothy David v Ibrahim 13 NLR 318, Kirihamy Muhandirama v Dingiri Appu"
"6 NLR 197, Raman Chetty et al., v Mohideen 18 NLR 478]. As per the stance taken by the Plaintiff"
"and his siblings, only if they can get a decree in favour of their father who is dead and gone and"
"not a party to the action, they become co-owners. Otherwise, evidence shows that some of them"
"live far away from the purported corpus. Unless they can prove co-ownership, they cannot say"
"one who possess represents the possession of the other co-owners. Anyway, it appears that the"
"6th Defendant was there in possession as confirmed by a 66 application."
"I
t appears that one of the grounds for the Learned High Court judges to allow the appeal and"
"dismiss  the  partition  action  was  that  the  predecessor  in  title  to  the  Plaintiff  and  his  siblings,"
"namely their father was not a party to the action which debars a court in terms of section 3 of"
"the  Prescription  Ordinance  from  decreeing  that  he  acquired  prescriptive  title  which  in  turn"
"debars a declaration that the Plaintiff and his siblings are co-owners."
"A
s a decree on prescriptive title can only be given in favor of a party to the action, in my view the"
"aforesaid conclusion of the learned High Court Judges is correct. It must be noted that no direct"
"question of law has been proposed through the petition or thus, allowed by this court with regard"
"to the said conclusion of the learned High Court Judges. Therefore, in a way the said conclusion"
"remains  unchallenged.  For  completeness, 
I  quote  the  relevant  portions  of  the  High  Court"
"judgement below which refer to aforesaid section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance and section 2"
"of the Partition Act respectively."
"(Referring to section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance)"
"“The  above  provisions  confer  a  right  on  the  possessor  who  has  been 
in  undisturbed  and"
"uninterrupted  possession  of  a 
land  to  bring  an  action  for  the  purpose  of  being  quieted 
in"
"possession or for a defendant who is sued in ejectment to take up the defense that he has acquired"
"title to the land in dispute by prescriptive possession but these provisions do not permit a person"
"who is in possession of  land to bring an action for partition on the basis that his predecessor in"
"title had acquired title to the land by prescription.  ”"
"(
Referring to section 2 of the Partition Act)"
"“In  view  of  the  provision  of  the  section  2  above  a  person  must  be  a  co-owner  of  land  to  be"
"partitioned to bring an action for partition. A person who is not a co-owner cannot bring an action"
"for partition. The plaintiff cannot expect for the court to decide whether a so called predecessor"
"in title had acquired title for the corpus by prescription and then proceed to investigate the title"
