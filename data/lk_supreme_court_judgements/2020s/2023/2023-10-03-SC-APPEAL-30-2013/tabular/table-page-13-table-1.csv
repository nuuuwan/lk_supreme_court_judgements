"to or denial of the title of the true owner, there can be no adverse possession. In deciding whether"
"the alleged acts of the person constitute adverse possession, regard must be had to the animus"
"of the person doing those acts.”"
"No evidence was led to show who was the true owner of lot 1 of plan no. 3365P at the time of"
"purported  entry  to  possess  it  by  the  Plaintiff’s  father.  The  interlocutory  judgement  of  the"
"previous  partition  action  has  not  been  tendered  for  the  court  to  see  why  the  said  lot  1  was"
"excluded or in whose favor it was excluded. If it was excluded in favor of the Plaintiff’s father the"
"Plaintiff or the people who want to partition the corpus would have marked it to support their"
"case. Non -production of the said judgment of the previous partition case which should contain"
"the reasons for exclusion of said Lot 1 should have been considered as a factor that prompts a"
"court to presume that the production of said evidence would have been not favourable to the"
"Plaintiff’s  stance.  For  example,  the  reason  could  have  been  that  it  was  a  different  land  as"
"described by the old deeds of the 6th Defendant’s chain of title as mentioned above. However,"
"the stance taken in the plaint was that the Plaintiff’s father acquired prescriptive title even prior"
"to the alleged infringing acts of the 6th to 9th Defendants but without revealing against whose"
"title he acquired prescriptive title."
"If this is a case to evict the 6th to 9th Defendants based on their alleged infringing acts for the"
"purpose of being quieted in his possession by the Plaintiff, it would have been a different scenario"
"altogether. In that situation the Plaintiff has to prove his adverse, uninterrupted and undisturbed"
"possession for ten years against the 6th  to 9th Defendants against any title they claim. In my"
"view, section 3 of the Prescription ordinance contemplates such situation. A claim of prescription"
"by  a  party  against  another  party  in  an  action  filed  in  court  and  not  a  situation  of  claiming"
"prescriptive title against whole world. However, for some reason, the Plaintiff has chosen to file"
"a Partition action which is an action in Rem and claim prescriptive title accrued to  their father"
"prior to his death which is also prior to the alleged infringing acts of the 6th to 9th Defendants."
"The Plaintiff has taken the arduous task of proving title against whole world without revealing"
"against  whose  title  their  father  acquired  prescriptive  title. 
In  my  view  one  cannot  prove"
"prescriptive title without revealing against whom he claims prescriptive title and without giving"
"that  person  an  opportunity  to  respond.  Furthermore,  as  per  section  3  of  the  Prescription"
"Ordinance itself, the time does not start to run against parties claiming rights in remainder or"
"reversion  and  section  13  of  the  same  ordinance  has  created  certain  limitations  to  claims  on"
"prescription  based  on  certain  disabilities.  Thus, 
indicating  the  person  against  whom  the"
"prescriptive claim is made in evidence is essential for a court to decide on prescriptive title. When"
"the Plaintiff and his siblings take up a position that their father acquired prescriptive title even"
"prior  to  the  alleged 
infringing  acts  by  the  6th  to  9th  Defendants, 
it 
is  questionable  and"
"unascertainable against whose true ownership he acquired prescriptive title."
"T
he learned High Court Judges have referred to Sirajudeen and Two Others v Abbas (1994) 2 SLR"

"Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to an immovable"
