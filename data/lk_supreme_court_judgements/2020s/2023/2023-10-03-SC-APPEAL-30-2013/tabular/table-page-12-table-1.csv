"of the parties to the action. The plaintiff came to court on the basis that his father acquired title"
"by prescription and that he and first to fifth defendants inherited from the father. The court in a"
"partition  action  cannot  declare  that  the  predecessor  in  title  of  the  plaintiff  and  first  to  fifth"
"defendants  acquired  title  by  prescription  specially  when  the  person  sough  to  be  declared  so"
"entitled is now deceased.”"
"I
n short, the learned High Court Judges have tried to point out that in terms of section 3 of the"
"Prescription Ordinance a Court cannot decree a person who is not before court has acquired title"
"by prescription. As per the stance taken by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff and the parties stand with"
"him cannot proceed ahead without getting such a declaration or decree."
"E
ven though the Plaintiff’s and the 1st to 5th Defendants’ position is that their father acquired the"
"prescriptive title and they inherited the property as co-owners at the demise of their father, the"
"paragraph 9 of the amended plaint as well as the point of contest number 3 raised at the trial"
"focus on whether the Plaintiff and the 1st to 5th Defendants acquired prescriptive title along with"
"their predecessor in title. Thus, it is necessary to see whether they have proved their prescriptive"
"title to  the  corpus  as  co-owners.  It  is  already  stated  above  if  the  court cannot hold that  their"
"father acquired prescriptive title, it cannot hold that they are co-owners through inheritance as"
"per their stance."
"I
t must be reiterated that the position of the Plaintiff was that the father of the Plaintiff and the"
"1st to 5th Defendants entered into the lot 1 of plan no.3356P after it was excluded from the corpus"
"of the partition case no. P3908 and acquired prescriptive title to it and Plaintiff and his siblings"
"got their right through inheritance. Since the 6th and 9th Defendants without any title acted in"
"violation of their rights, they want to get the land partitioned. Thus, the case was not presented"
"to say that the Plaintiff and his siblings along with the possession of their predecessor adversely"
"possessed  it  against  the  title  of  the  6th  to  9th  Defendants  and  they  acquired  prescriptive  title"
"against the 6th to 9th Defendants. It is presumed that if a person enters into a possession in one"
"capacity, he continues to possess it in the same capacity unless he changes the nature of the"
"possession by an overt act. Adverse possession means a possession incompatible with the title"
"of the true owner or the title holder. (See Fernando v Wijesooriya et al., 48 NLR 320). To acquire"
"ownership or dominion of a property, the adverse possession must be against the true ownership"
"of the property in a manner denying the said ownership. Thus, if one claims prescriptive title to"
"gain ownership of a property, he must reveal against whose ownership the adverse possession"
"was exercised. In I. De Silva V Commissioner General of Inland Revenue 80 N L R 292, it was held"
"that,  “The  Principle  of  law  is  well  established  that  a  person  who  bases  his  title  in  adverse"
"possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the"
"real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed. In order to constitute"
"adverse possession, the possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The acts of the"
"person  in  possession  should  be  irreconcilable  with  the  rights  of  the  true  owner;  the  person  in"
"possession must claim to be so as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no hostility"
