"Misso  L.S  plan  was  excluded  for  the  benefit  of  the  Plaintiff’s  father.  However,  it  was  said  in"
"evidence that the disputed land in the 66 application was given to the 6th Defendant on the basis"
"that the 6th Defendant was in possession at the date of filing of that application."
"A
nanda Lekam is a relative of the parties who had come to the Walawwa on several occasions"
"and stayed there even. Wallawwa is not within the corpus. He has given evidence with regard to"
"the access road he used to visit Wallawwa. He has also stated about some cultivation of crops"
"around said road but do not indicate whose cultivation was that. However, he too does not state"
"facts  sufficient  to  decide  that  the  possession  of  Plaintiff  and  1st  to  5th  Defendants  and  their"
"predecessor  was  adverse  to  the  title  of  the  true  owner  who  is  unknown  or  to  the  6th  to  9th"
"Defendants."
"5th  Defendant  Swarna  Karalliadde  and  the  Plaintiff  have  given  evidence  to  indicate  that  the"
"threshing floor, cow shed, garage and the place where the elephants were tethered were within"
"the  lot  1 of the plan no,  3356P  excluded  from  the  previous  partition action.  However  certain"
"areas shown by the Plaintiff to the commissioner does not fall within the corpus identified by the"
"commissioner  in  making  the preliminary plan no.2213  and  Lot  2  was  identified  as part  of  the"
"corpus through superimposition. It is observed that the Plaintiff and the parties who wanted to"
"partition the corpus based on prescriptive rights have not taken any steps to indicate that those"
"places referred to by the witnesses to prove their possession were within the corpus as identified"
"through  the preliminary  survey by showing  those  places  to  the  court  commissioner.  If the  5th"
"Defendant and the  Plaintiff rely on those facts relating to the existence of a garage threshing"
"floor, cow shed etc. in the past, they could have shown those areas where they were to the court"
"commissioner during the survey. Even if it is presumed that they were within the area identified"
"as the corpus by the preliminary survey, it itself does not prove that the possession was adverse."
"It has to be presumed that the nature of the possession of their father continued. As said before"
"there is no material to established that their father’s possession was adverse. It is necessary to"
"prove  the  possession  of  their  father  was  adverse  to  the  true  owner  of  the  corpus  when  he"
"entered into the said corpus sought to be partitioned. However, when the 5th Defendant gave"
"evidence in 2003, she was 42 years old. Thus, she was born in 1961 and when the Plaintiff gave"
"evidence, she was 58 years of age in 2005 indicating that she was born in 1947. Final partition"
"plan and final decree of the previous partition action were made in 1953 and 1954 respectively."
"Thus the 5th Defendant was born after the final decree and the Plaintiff appeared to be a child of"
"very mild age when the said final decree of the previous partition action was entered. If, as per"
"their stance, their father entered into the excluded lot 1 after the said partition decree of the"
"previous  partition  action,  5th  Defendant  cannot  have  any  personal  knowledge  or  the  Plaintiff"
"cannot have well informed knowledge with regard to the animus (intention) of their father when"
"he  commenced  his  possession  or  whether  he  entered  with  permission  of  someone  else  or"
"whether it was adverse to someone else’s title."
"5
th Defendant as well as the  Plaintiff through their evidence tried to convince court that their"
"father took the crops from the land sought to be partitioned and cultivated it and  thereafter,"
