"T
he fifth Defendant who stands with the Plaintiff to get the purported corpus partitioned, in her"
"oral evidence has twice stated that there is no specific name to the corpus. The learned District"
"Judge has failed to appreciate that one of the old deeds, which is older than the final decree of"
"the previous partition action, namely deed no.1525 in the chain of title of the sixth Defendant"
"contains  a  land  named  “Gama  Walawwe  Watta”  as  described  by  the  sixth  Defendant  in  his"
"statement of claim and the deeds written after that on the strength of the title gained through"
"that deed also have described the land dealt by those deeds as Lot 1 of plan 3365P of case no."
"P3908. Thus, there were material to think that the exclusion was done in the previous partition"
"action  since  Lot  1  was  a  different  land  as  described  by  the  6th  Defendant.  In  my  view  mere"
"attempts to show certain errors of the learned High Court Judges through the questions of law"
"raised will not suffice if the Plaintiff Appellant fails to satisfy this court that the substantial rights"
"were affected by the dismissal of their case by the High Court. The Plaintiff’s substantial rights"
"are affected by the dismissal made in the High Court only if the District Judge had come to the"
"correct finding to partition the corpus."
"H
owever, for the reasons discussed below in this judgement, I am of the view that the learned"
"High Court Judges were correct in coming to their conclusion to allow the appeal before them"
"and to dismiss the plaint as the learned District Judge erred in deciding to partition the purported"
"corpus of this action."
"I
t must be stated here that the Roman Dutch law of acquisitive prescription ceased to be in force"
"after Regulation no.13 of 1882 and that the Prescription Ordinance is the sole law governing the"
"acquisition of rights by virtue of adverse possession. The common law of acquisitive prescription"
"is no longer in force except as regard the crown. [See W.Perera v C. Ranatunge (1964) 66 N L R"
"337 at 339, also see Dabare v Martelis Appu 5 N L R 210, Terunnanse v Menike 1 N L R 200 at"
"202, Fernando v Wijesooriya et al 48 N L R 320 at 325, I.L.M. Cadija Umma and Another v S. Don"

"S
ince  it  is  the  Prescription  Ordinance  that  governs  the  acquisitive  prescription  in  relation  to"
"immovable property, it is worthwhile to quote section 3 of the said ordinance here."
"“3. Proof of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or by those"
"under whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of"
"that  of the claimant or plaintiff in such action ( that is to say, a possession unaccompanied by"
"payment  of  rent  or  produce,  or  performance  of  service  or  duty,  or  by  any  other  act  by  the"
"possessor, from which an acknowledgement of a right existing in another person would fairly and"
"naturally  be  inferred  )  for  ten  years  previous  to  the  bringing  of  such  action,  shall  entitle  the"
"defendant to a decree in his favour with costs. And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring"
"his action, or any third party shall intervene in any action for the purpose of being quieted in his"
"possession  of  lands  or  other  immovable  property,  or  to  prevent  encroachment  or  usurpation"
