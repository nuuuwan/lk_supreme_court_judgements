Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Avissawella seeking to set aside the deed of gift marked P1 on

gross ingratitude. The defendant is a relative of the plaintiff. By this

deed the plaintiff donated the property to the defendant subject to her

life interest. The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the

plaintiffs action. After trial, the District Judge entered judgment for

the plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Avissawella

reversed the judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs action on the

ground that gross ingratitude had not been proved. Hence this appeal

by the plaintiff.

The general rule is that a deed of gift is absolute and irrevocable.

However, under the Roman Dutch law, which is our common law, such

a deed of gift can be revoked with the intervention of Court inter alia on

ingratitude on the part of the donee. The fact that the term irrevocable

donation is used in the deed is not decisive.

This is now recognised by statute as well. In terms of sections 2 and 3

of the Revocation of Irrevocable Deeds of Gift on the Ground of Gross

Ingratitude Act, No. 5 of 2017, an irrevocable deed of gift may be

revoked on the ground of gross ingratitude, only on an order made by a

competent court, in an action filed by the donor against the donee

within a period of ten years from the date of the execution of the deed

and within two years from the date on which the cause of action arose.

Slight ingratitude is not sufficient. There shall be gross ingratitude. No

hard and fast rule can be laid down on what constitutes gross

ingratitude. It is a question of fact, not of law. A single act or a series of

acts can constitute gross ingratitude. An assault on the donor by the

donee is a clear instance of gross ingratitude. Depending on the facts

4 SC/APPEAL/140/2017

and circumstances of each individual case, for instance, threats to

cause bodily injury to the donor by the donee, continuous slander and

insult, damage to the donors property, ill-treatment of the donor can

constitute gross ingratitude. The onus of proof is on the donor and the

standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities. Vide Sinnammah v.

Nallanathar (1946) 47 NLR 32, Krishnaswamy v. Thillaiyampalam

(1957) 59 NLR 265, Fernando v. Perera (1959) 63 NLR 236, Calendar v.

Fernando [2001] 2 Sri LR 355, Ariyawathie Meemaduma v. Jeewani

[2002] 2 Sri LR 409, Gunawathie v. Premawathi

(SC/APPEAL/31/2013, SC Minutes of 05.04.2019), Wasantha Cooray

v. Indrani Cooray [2020] 1 Sri LR 150.

The failure to fulfil the conditions of the gift (such as that the donee

shall provide succour and assistance to the donor) is a ground to

revoke the gift. This is an incidence of gross ingratitude.

In the leading case of Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini

Senanayake [1992] 2 Sri LR 181 at 220, Amarasinghe J. states:

A donor is entitled to revoke a donation on account of ingratitude

(1) if the donee lays manus impias on the donor; (2) if he does him

an atrocious injury; (3) if he wilfully causes him great loss of

property; (4) if he makes an attempt upon his life; (5) if he does not

fulfil the conditions attached to the gift. In addition, a gift may be

revoked for other, equally grave, causes.

Has the plaintiff donor in the instant case proved gross ingratitude on

the part of the defendant donee? Both gave evidence at the trial. The

donor is a widow. She does not have children. Since the death of her

husband, the donor has been living in the donated house all alone. The

donee in her evidence admits that the donor is a sick lady. (page 81 of

5 SC/APPEAL/140/2017

the brief) At the time of giving evidence, the donor was 75 years of age

and the donee 29 years of age. The donees mother in her evidence

stated that the donor was eating very little, about one spoonful for a

meal. (page 87) This itself indicates that the donor was feeble and in

need of care and protection. In my view, according to the evidence of

the donee herself, she did not look after the donor.

The donors husband died on 01.01.2003. The deed of gift was

executed on 01.09.2003. According to the evidence of the donee, the

donee left home for further studies in 2002 and continued to be away

from her home till 2007. (pages 71-72) That means, she did not look

after the plaintiff for about five years. The defendant got married in

2007.

The donors evidence is that in April 2008, the donee and her father

came to her house and, using abusive language, demanded vacant

possession of the house. This was corroborated by the evidence of

Dayawathie, a neighbour. The donor further says that the donee and

her father told her that she could be sent to a home for elders.

The donor made a police complaint marked P2 dated 20.06.2008

stating that the donee does not look after her. The police have not

acted on this complaint. This case has been filed on 17.11.2008.

The donee admits in evidence that the donor gifted this property, her

dwelling house, expecting that the donee will look after her until her

death but she could not look after the donor properly. (pages 77-78 of

the brief)

The District Court held that the plaintiff proved gross ingratitude but

the High Court held otherwise. The High Court gives undue

prominence to the police complaint marked P2 and concludes that the

6 SC/APPEAL/140/2017

plaintiffs version is not supported by the police complaint. The High

Court did not consider the evidence of the defendant. In my view, on

the facts and circumstances of this case, the High Court should not

have reversed the judgment of the District Court on the merits, as

there is sufficient evidence to prove gross ingratitude on a balance of

probabilities.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted and the

answers to them are as follows:

Has the High Court misdirected itself when it failed to consider

that the defendant herself admitted that she failed to look after

the plaintiff?

Yes.

Has the High Court misdirected itself when it failed to consider

that the defendant herself admitted that she knew that the

condition of the deed of gift is that the defendant must take care

of the defendant for the rest of her life and that such failure

constitutes gross ingratitude?

Yes.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment of

the District Court and allow the appeal with costs.
