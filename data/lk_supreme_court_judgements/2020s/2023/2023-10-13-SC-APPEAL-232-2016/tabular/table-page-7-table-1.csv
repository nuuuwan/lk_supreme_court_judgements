"(19)","Before I address the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted,"
"","it  would  be  of  significant  importance  to  consider  the  findings  and  the"
"","conclusions of the learned District Judge in refusing the application of the"
"","Plaintiff  to  refuse  to  issue  the  writ  for  the  second  time  based  on  his"
"","application made in 2012."
"(20)","The reason being, the judges of the High Court set aside the order of the"
"","learned District Judge who refused to issue the writ for the second time, in"
"","exercising  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  vested  in  them.  The  criteria  for"
"","exercising revisionary power, as a discretionary remedy, is when the court's"
"","conscience  is  shocked  by  the  illegality  of  the  order  that  is  sought  to  be"
"","revised."
"(21)","In the circumstances aforesaid, it would be pertinent to consider the order"
"","made by both the learned District Judge as well as the High Court of Civil"
"","Appeals. It is significant to note that the learned High Court judges have not"
"","referred to any illegality of the order of the learned District Judge but have"
"","merely stated in their order that â€œa writ for the second time cannot be issued"
