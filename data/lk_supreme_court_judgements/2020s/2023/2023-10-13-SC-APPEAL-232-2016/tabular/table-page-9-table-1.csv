"(26)","Although the petition filed before this court also  states that the reason to"
"","dismiss the contempt proceeding filed by the Plaintiff was due to the fact"
"","that  the challenge by  the Defendant  to  vary  the  decree  was  still  pending"
"","before  an  appellate  forum,  when  perusing  the  said  order  of  the  District"
"","Court, it is evident that the refusal to proceed with the contempt charges"
"","was based on the ratio of the case of Regent International Hotel Ltd v. Cyril"
"","Gardiner 78-79 1 SLR 278 and the order does not refer to any pending case"
"","before  an  appellate  forum  as  a  fetter  to  inquire  into  the  allegation  of"
"","contempt against the Defendant."
"(27)","The  assertion,  therefore,  of  the  Plaintiff,  that  he  had  to  wait  to  make  an"
"","application to issue the writ for the second time till the rights of the parties"
"","were finally determined in 2011, does not appear to be accurate. The fact"
"","remains 
that 
the  Plaintiffâ€™s  complaint  of 
interruption 
to  his  peaceful"
"","enjoyment  of  the  roadway  was  only  after  six  years  from  the  date  of  the"
"","execution of the writ which was in 2003."
"(28)","Undoubtedly, the Defendant appears to have prevented the Plaintiff from"
"","enjoying  the  right  he  won  years  after  litigation  and  the  conduct  of  the"
"","defendant cannot be condoned by this court; however, this court is called"
"","upon to decide on specific legal issues and not the contumacious conduct"
"","of the Defendant."
"(29)","As referred to earlier, all we are called upon to decide is whether the High"
"","Court of Civil Appeals had corrected an illegality of the Order made by the"
"","learned District Judge."
"(30)","The learned District judge, in refusing  to issue the writ for the second time,"
"","had observed that  the  application  was  made many  years [six years]  after"
"","the previous order was made, and in terms of Section 325(1) of the CPC,"
"","where  after  the  officer  [fiscal]  has  delivered  possession,  the  Judgement-"
"","Creditor 
is  hindered  or  ousted 
  by 
the 
Judgement-Debtor, 
in 
taking"
"","complete  and  effectual  possession,  in  the  case  of  immovable  property,"
