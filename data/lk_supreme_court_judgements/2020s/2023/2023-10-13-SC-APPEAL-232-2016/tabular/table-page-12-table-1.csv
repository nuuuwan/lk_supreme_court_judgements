"","This  position  was  previously  affirmed 
in  Badrun  Nisa Wazeer  Vs."
"","Velayuthan  90  2  SLR  146  and  in Sinna Lebbe Saliya Umma Vs. Shahul"
"","Hameed Mohammed & Others,  S.C  Appeal No.  99/2014,  S.C  Minutes  of"
"","04.04.2018. In the case of Badrun Nisa Wazeer, it was held that the time"
"","clause in S. 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code is mandatory, and that per"
"","the  Section,  in  matters  relating  to  immovable  property,  a  party  who  was"
"","dispossessed or obstructed from exercising possession within one year and"
"","one day can complain to court within one month of ouster or hindrance."
"","The  learned  District  Court  Judge  had  also  relied  on  the  aforementioned"
"","judgement in his Order."
"(35)","The  Fiscal  delivered  possession  to  the  Plaintiff  on  19th  June  2003.  The"
"","Plaintiff invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court to seek a writ for the"
"","second time on 06th September 2012. If there had been a hindrance to the"
"","Plaintiff  enjoying  complete  and  effectual  possession  within  one  year  and"
"","one  day  of  19th 
June  2003, 
the  Petitioner  should  have 
invoked 
the"
"","jurisdiction within one month of such hindrance. The Petitioner had only"
"","made an application under Section 325(1) after 9 years of being delivered"
"","possession.  Therefore,  it  is  evident  that  the  Plaintiff  had  not  invoked  the"
"","jurisdiction of the District Court in the manner required by the law and the"
"","Order  of  the  learned  District  Cort  Judge  was  lawful  and  could  not  have"
"","shocked the conscience of the court."
"","In the circumstances, I find that it would not be necessary to determine the"
"","first (i) question of law since the application for the issue of a fresh writ, as"
"","stated in the question of law (ii) was in fact time barred. Accordingly, the"
"","questions of law; “Have the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court"

Mount Lavinia erred in law by holding that the application for issue of a"
