"","the  Plaintiff  had  acquired  prescriptive 
rights  over 
the 
roadway  by"

"","and delivered judgement holding that the Plaintiff is entitled to the right of"
"","way sought by him."
"(3)","The Defendant asserts that, consequent to the entering of  the decree,  the"
"","writ was executed and possession in respect of the right of way had been"
"","handed over to the Plaintiff on 19.06.2003."
"(4)","The Defendant, however, sought to have the decree amended on the basis"
"","that the same was not in conformity with the judgement. Having heard the"
"","parties, by his order dated 04.03.2004, the learned District Judge rejected"
"","application of the Defendant."
"(5)","Aggrieved  by 
the  order  referred 
to

"(6)","During the pendency of the appeal filed by the Defendant referred to above,"

"","into and determine the allegation of contempt against the Defendant."

"","paragraphs 4 and 5 above] the Plaintiff, in 2012, by way of  Petition and"
"","affidavit moved the District Court for a direction on the fiscal, to have the"

"","handed over to the Plaintiff, who became entitled to the same, by virtue of"
"","the judgement delivered by the District Court in 2001."
