"Q. d) Whether the contents of folio G/63/221 arose directly out of the cross-examination; it was"
"also  relevant  in  respect  of  issues  Nos  26  and  28  namely,  whether  it  was  the  Petitioner  ‘s"
"(Plaintiff’s) deed or the Respondent’s (Defendant’s) deed which passed the title?"
"A.  It did  not directly  arise  from the  cross-examination  but  was  in  issue  from  the  moment  the"
"answer was filed. Raising of issues no.26 and 28 itself indicates that the Plaintiff was aware about"
"what  she  has  to  prove  to  be  successful  in  the  case  filed  but  for  some  reason  did  not  list  the"
"documents in terms of section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Plaintiff could have taken"
"steps to list necessary documents and indicate the scope of his evidence for the Defendant to"
"take notice to prepare for his  case and take necessary steps to present his case in relation to"
"those documents. The question has to be answered in favour of the Defendant."
"Q. e) Whether the order of the learned trial judge was ex facie and palpably incorrect in as much"
"as the petitioner (Plaintiff) in fact sought the permission  of court to produce p7(P10 with the"
"petition), a copy of the said folio G/63/221, and that itself constituted a ground for the exercise"
"of revisionary jurisdiction?"
"A. Even if the permission was sought to mark it during evidence in re-examination, no acceptable"
"reason was given why it was not listed in term of section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and"
"why it was not moved to produce in examination-in-chief. Since allowing of the document at that"
"stage  could  have  caused  prejudice  to  the  Defendant,  even  if  such  request  was  considered  as"
"properly  made,  refusal  to  accept  the  document  is  correct  and  Revision  being  a  discretionary"
"remedy it should not have been used by the High Court. Hence this Court need not interfere with"
"the decision. The question has to be answered in favour of the Defendant."
"For the reasons given above this appeal is dismissed. No costs."
