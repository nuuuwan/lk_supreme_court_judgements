"also had closed his case without calling any evidence. The learned Additional District Judge has"
"given time till 20.01.2010 to file written submissions. It appears that when the District Court case"
"was pending for filing of the written submissions before judgment, on 18.01.2010, the Plaintiff"
"has filed the aforesaid revision application before the Civil Appellate High Court praying to set"
"aside the said order dated 11.12.2009 and for an order directing the District Court to accept the"
"said folio G/63/221 and a deed bearing number 3060 attested by Kuintos Cory [Sic] Notary Public-"
"vide X1. It must be noted that no permission was asked from the District Court to tender deed"
"no. 3060 attested by Quintus Cooray, Notary Public in evidence. Thus, the revision application"
"before the High Court focused not only in correcting the order made by the learned District Judge"
"if  there  was  any  miscarriage  of  justice,  but  it  also  contained  a  prayer  to  allow  a  deed  to  be"
"produced in evidence which application was never made before the District Court. In my view,"
"the Plaintiff should not have asked any relief from the High Court in relation to the tendering of"
"deed no.3060 as there was no application made in that regard to the original court nor a decision"
"made on that aspect. However, there was no relief contained in the petition to the High Court"
"praying to set aside all proceedings held after the said order was made by the District Court on"
"11.12.2009. Anyhow, in the leave to appeal application made to this court over the dismissal of"
"the said revision application, other than for a direction on the District Court to accept the said"
"folio G/63/221, there is no relief prayed in relation to the said deed no.3060, but it contains a"
"new relief praying to set aside the proceedings that was held after the making of the said order"
"dated 11.12.2009 by the District Court; a new relief that was not there before the High Court."
"Thus, other than correcting any errors in the order made by the learned High Court Judges, this"
"application made to this Court is intended to get more relief which was not within the scope of"
"the prayer made to the High Court. I do not think that it is proper for this Court to consider a"
"relief which was not canvassed before the High Court in an appeal made against the order of the"
"High Court."
"Even  the  Plaintiff  admits  that  the  said  Folio  G/63/221  was  not  included  in  a  list  tendered  in"
"accordance  with  section  121(2)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  Section  138  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  provides  for  clarifications  which  may  be  needed  after  cross-examination.  If  new"
"evidence is led during such clarification with the permission of Court, the adverse party is entitled"
"to cross examine again. Thus, it is necessary to see whether marking of the Folio G63/221 was"
"necessary  to  clarify  matters  revealed  through  cross-examination  or  rather  the  application  to"
"produce the said folio was to cure the lapses made by the Plaintiff in preparing for the Trial and"
"leading evidence. In this regard, it is pertinent to refer to the facts relevant to the case at hand."
"The Plaintiff instituted the action by the plaint dated 31.01.2005 in the District Court of Kalutara"
"against the Defendant for a declaration of title to a divided and defined allotment of land called"
"Lot 3E of Lot 3 of Horagasmulla more fully described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint which was"
"2.73 perches in extent as per the plan no.4972A made by W. Seneviratne L.S., and sought a decree"
"be entered in her favour, if necessary to evict the Defendant and place her in possession. She"
"further prayed for recovery of damages from the Defendant for wrongfully removing the gate"
"fixed by the Plaintiff."
