Before: P. Padman Surasena, J Kumudini Wickremasinghe, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Pasindu Silva for the Petitioners

Rajitha Perera, Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents Argued on: 18th October 2021 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioners on 23rd February 2021 Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 4th September 2020 Decided on: 2nd August 2023 Obeyesekere, J

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the decision of the

Provincial Public Service Commission of the Southern Province [the Provincial Public

Service Commission] to cancel the promotions granted by it to each of the Petitioners

to the posts of District Officer for Co-operative Development or Assistant

Commissioner of Co-operative Development, is arbitrary and whether it amounts to

an infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

Provisions of the Provincial Councils Act

In terms of Section 32(3) of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, as amended,

The Governor shall provide for and determine all matters relating to officers of the

provincial public service, including the formulation of schemes of recruitment and

codes of conduct for such officers, the principle to be followed in, making promotions

and transfers, and the procedure for the exercise and the delegation of the powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of such officers. In

formulating such schemes of recruitment and codes of conduct the Governor shall, as

far as practicable, follow the schemes of recruitment prescribed for corresponding

offices in the public service and the codes of conduct prescribed for officers holding

corresponding offices in the public service. [emphasis added]

4

While Section 32(1) provided that, Subject to the provisions of any other law, the

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the provincial

public service of such Province is hereby vested in the Governor of that Province, this

power may be delegated to the Provincial Public Service Commission in terms of

Section 32(2) of the Act, which reads thus:

The Governor of a Province may, from time to time, delegate his powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the

provincial public service to the Provincial Public Service Commission of that

Province.

The above provisions can thus be summarised as follows:

(a) The Governor of a Province shall provide for and determine all matters relating

to officers of the Provincial Public Service;

(b) The Governor of a Province has been vested with the power of appointment and

the transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers in the Provincial Public

Service;

(c) The Provincial Public Service Commission can exercise such powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control only upon its delegation

by the Governor and to the extent to which such power has been delegated.

It is admitted that the 1st Respondent had delegated the powers of appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control to the Provincial Public Service Commission.

The Co-operative Service and Schemes of Recruitment

The Petitioners had been appointed as Co-operative Inspectors in the Department of

Co-operative Development during the period 1983 to 1988. With the subject of co-

operative development being devolved to the Provincial Councils pursuant to the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution, the Petitioners had been appointed as Co-operative

Inspectors by the Provincial Public Service Commission. The post of Co-operative

Inspector had been re-designated as Co-operative Development Officer [CDO] in 2015,

and as at the time of the filing of this application, the Petitioners were serving as CDOs.

5

The Scheme of Recruitment that prevailed at the time the Petitioners joined the

service, as well as the Scheme of Recruitment that replaced the said Scheme in 1996,

contained provisions relating to the promotion of Co-operative Inspectors to the posts

of District Officer for Co-operative Development [DOCD] and Assistant Commissioner

of Co-operative Development [ACCD], based on seniority and satisfactory service, with

satisfactory service being determined on confidential assessment reports. In January

2015, with the concurrence of the Provincial Public Service Commission, the 1st

Respondent. i.e., the Governor of the Southern Province, had introduced three

separate Schemes of Recruitment for CDOs, DOCDs and ACCDs. As provided for

therein, all Petitioners were absorbed into Grade I of the CDO service with effect from

19th January 2015.

Appointment of the Petitioners

The Provincial Public Service Commission had decided that vacancies that existed at

the time the new Schemes of Recruitment were introduced in January 2015 should be

filled under the 1996 Scheme of Recruitment, while vacancies that arose after January

2015 were to be filled in terms of the criteria specified in the newly introduced 2015

Schemes of Recruitment.

Accordingly, by letter dated 3rd March 2016, the Provincial Public Service Commission

had directed the Commissioner of Co-operative Development to call for applications

in terms of the 1996 Scheme of Recruitment to fill three vacancies in the post of DOCD

that had arisen prior to 19th January 2015. Although the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th Petitioners

had applied and thereafter been called for the interview, they were not successful, as

selection under the 1996 Scheme of Recruitment was based on seniority and

satisfactory service.

On the same date, i.e., 3rd March 2016, the Provincial Public Service Commission had

also called for applications to fill a further five vacancies that had arisen in the post of

DOCD after the introduction of the 2015 Scheme of Recruitment, for the filling of

which vacancies the Scheme of Recruitment introduced in 2015 was to apply. The

notice issued by the Provincial Public Service Commission contained the criteria that

had to be fulfilled by all candidates, and specifically provided that all candidates must

have successfully completed all three Efficiency Bar Examinations in the CDO service.

6

Further to the interviews that were held on 31st May 2016 and 7th June 2016, and

based on the results thereof, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th Petitioners were appointed to

the post of DOCD by the Provincial Public Service Commission, soon thereafter.

In addition to the above, applications had also been called on 23rd February 2016 from

those in the Supra Grade of the CDO service and those who had completed five years

in Grade I in the CDO service to fill three vacancies in the post of ACCD that had arisen

after the introduction of the 2015 Scheme of Recruitment. This notice too specified

that CDOs in Grade I must have passed all three Efficiency Bar Examinations for CDOs.

Pursuant to the conducting of interviews in June 2016, the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th

Petitioners were appointed by the Provincial Public Service Commission to the post of

ACCD.

Challenging the appointments

On 21st June 2016, eighteen persons holding the posts of either CDO or DOCD and who

had also faced the above interviews to fill the vacancies in the posts of DOCD or ACCD

that had arisen after January 2015 but were unsuccessful, challenged the said

appointments of the Petitioners by invoking the jurisdiction of this Court in SC (FR)

Application No. 211/2016. While the Petitioners in this application had been named

as respondents in that application, the primary complaint of the petitioners in that

application was that the marking scheme attached to the 2015 Schemes of

Recruitment was arbitrary and contrary to their legitimate expectations in that it

departed from the existing scheme of selection based on seniority and satisfactory

service, and instead sought for the first time to confer thirty of the one hundred marks

to candidates possessing additional educational qualifications (Bachelors Degrees or

equivalent), and professional qualifications (local or foreign training). On 23rd

September 2016, this Court had granted leave to proceed in SC (FR) Application No.

211/2016 in relation to the alleged infringement of the fundamental rights of those

petitioners guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Cancellation of the appointments

The issue that culminated in this application arose when the Secretary to the Provincial

Public Service Commission informed the Petitioners by his letter dated 19th December

2016 that the aforementioned promotion of the Petitioners had been cancelled

7

pursuant to a directive dated 2nd December 2016 issued by the 1st Respondent.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioners filed this application on 27th January

2017 complaining that neither the 1st Respondent nor the Provincial Public Service

Commission had any legal authority to cancel the said appointments and hence the

said decision was arbitrary and illegal as well as contrary to the rules of natural justice

and hence was in violation of their fundamental right to equality before the law and

the equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Leave to proceed in relation to the alleged infringement of Article 12(1) had been

granted by this Court on 2nd August 2017. With the consent of all parties, both

applications were taken up for argument together.

I shall now consider the reasons adduced by the Provincial Public Service Commission

for the above decision to cancel the promotions granted to the Petitioners.

Requirement to complete the Efficiency Bar Examinations

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondents submitted that

Clause 8 of the 2015 Scheme of Recruitment for CDOs makes it mandatory for each

CDO to complete three Efficiency Bar Examinations at the times specified therein, with

the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination having to be completed within five years of being

promoted to Grade I of the CDO service. Clause 7.4.2.5 of the 2015 Schemes of

Recruitment for DOCDs and ACCDs stipulated further that an applicant must have

passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination in order to be eligible for promotion to the

post of DOCD or ACCD. It must be noted that paragraph 4 of the letter informing the

Petitioners of their absorption to Grade I of the CDO service specifically provided that

the Petitioners must pass all three Efficiency Bar Examinations in the CDO service to

be eligible for promotion, thus placing the Petitioners on notice of that fact.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted further that none of the Petitioners

had passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination for CDOs and therefore were not eligible

to be considered for promotion to the post of either DOCD or ACCD. Of course, one

must bear in mind that this requirement to pass the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination was

only introduced in the Scheme of Recruitment issued in January 2015 and that the said

examination had not been held since the introduction of the 2015 Schemes of

Recruitment, with the result that it was impossible for any of the CDOs in service at

that time to be eligible for promotion to the posts of DOCD and ACCD.

8

Exemption from the requirement to pass the Efficiency Bar Examinations

The learned Deputy Solicitor General, while submitting that none of the three Schemes

of Recruitment introduced in 2015 contained any transitional provisions addressing

this issue, drew the attention of this Court to Paragraph 15 in each of the three

Schemes of Recruitment of 2015 which reads as follows: fuu nojd .ekSfuS mgsmdgsfha jsOsjsOdk i,id fkdue;s hus lrekla fjf;d;a ta iusnkaOfhka ol=Kq m<d;a rdcH fiajd fldusIka

iNdj jsuid wdKavqldr;=ud jsiska ;Srkh lrkq ,efnS.

It was therefore the position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that in the

absence of any of the applicants having passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination, it

was imperative upon the Provincial Public Service Commission to have sought a

decision from the 1st Respondent whether an exemption could be granted from the

said requirement and/or whether appointments could be made in the aforementioned

circumstances, taking into consideration that the said requirement had only been

introduced in 2015 and that no examinations had yet been conducted.

Notwithstanding the fact that none of the CDOs had passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar

Examination, and without having obtained a decision of the 1st Respondent, the

Provincial Public Service Commission had proceeded to call for applications to fill the

vacancies, conducted the interviews and proceeded to appoint the Petitioners to the

applicable posts in June/July 2016. The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted

that in the absence of any approval from the 1st Respondent, the Provincial Public

Service Commission had no mandate to appoint the Petitioners to the posts of DOCD

and ACCD, and hence, the actions of the Provincial Public Service Commission are ultra

vires the powers delegated to it in terms of Section 32(2) of the Provincial Councils Act.

Reason for the cancellation of the promotions

This issue of the Petitioners not having passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination came

to the forefront only after the filing of the aforementioned SC (FR) Application No.

211/2016, with the petitioners in that application claiming that the appointments of

the Petitioners in this application were bad in law. By his letter dated 14th July 2016,

the Commissioner of Co-operative Development (Southern Province) had sought the

advice of the Secretary, Ministry of Co-operative Development (Southern Province) in

this regard. The Secretary in turn had sought the advice of the Provincial Public Service

9

Commission, which had confirmed by its letter dated 8th August 2016 that an

exemption from the above requirement was granted by the Provincial Public Service

Commission, taking into consideration the fact the Petitioners had already completed

five years of service in Grade I of CDO and had duly earned all salary increments.

The aforementioned letter of the Provincial Public Service Commission does not

disclose whether the said decision had been taken prior to the making of the

appointments of the Petitioners to the posts of DOCD or ACCD. However, pursuant to

further discussions between the Provincial Public Service Commission and the 1st

Respondent, the Provincial Public Service Commission had decided to cancel the

aforementioned promotions and to call for fresh applications to fill the vacancies that

existed in the posts of DOCD and ACCD, as the 1st Respondent had not approved the

granting of an exemption. This decision had been communicated to the 1st Respondent

by letter dated 8th November 2016, and the approval of the 1st Respondent for such

decision of the Provincial Public Service Commission had been granted by letter dated

2nd December 2016. It is only thereafter that the decision to cancel the promotions

was duly communicated to the Petitioners by letter dated 19th December 2016.

Is the cancellation of the promotions arbitrary?

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the power of promotion

delegated to the Provincial Public Service Commission included the power to grant an

exemption from the aforementioned requirement with regard to the 3rd Efficiency Bar

Examination and that the Provincial Public Service Commission has been pressurised

into withdrawing the promotions granted to the Petitioners by those persons who filed

SC (FR) Application No. 211/2016.

It was the position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that even though the power

of appointment of public officers and their promotion had been delegated to the

Provincial Public Service Commission, the Commission did not have the power either

in terms of the said delegation or in terms of the said Scheme of Recruitment to grant

an exemption from the requirement to have passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar Examination

in order to be eligible for promotion. He submitted that this power had been conferred

exclusively on the 1st Respondent by Section 32(3) of the Provincial Councils Act and

that paragraph 15 in the 2015 Schemes of Recruitment stipulating that anything not

10

provided for in the Scheme of Recruitment shall be decided by the 1st Respondent in

consultation with the Provincial Public Service Commission, is a reflection of that

power.

Having carefully considered the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners

and the learned Deputy Solicitor General, I am of the view that the provisions of the

2015 Scheme of Recruitment must be strictly followed in making appointments to, and

promotions within, the Provincial Public Service. This includes ensuring compliance

with the requirement set out in Clause 7.4.2.5 of the said Schemes of Recruitment for

both DOCDs and ACCDs stipulating that in order to be eligible for promotion to either

of the posts of DOCD or ACCD, the candidate must have passed the 3rd Efficiency Bar

Examination stipulated for CDOs. Although the power of the 1st Respondent that is

delegated to the Provincial Public Service Commission in terms of Section 32(2)

includes the power to appoint or promote officers, I am in agreement with the learned

Deputy Solicitor General that in the absence of any provision in the Scheme of

Recruitment that enables the Provincial Public Service Commission to grant

exemptions from the requirements specified in the said Schemes, and in view of the

fact that decisions in respect of matters not provided for in the Schemes of

Recruitment have been reserved for the 1st Respondent, the Provincial Public Service

Commission did not have the power to deviate from the Schemes of Recruitment in

granting the promotions.

The Provincial Public Service Commission must take full responsibility for the plight of

the Petitioners, for the reason that, having introduced the new Schemes of

Recruitment which contained the above requirement to successfully complete all

three Efficiency Bar Examinations in order to be eligible for promotion to the post of

DOCD and ACCD in January 2015, and in spite of the Schemes of Recruitment clearly

specifying that the examinations must be held at least once a year, the Provincial

Public Service Commission has failed to conduct the said examinations prior to calling

for applications. In fact, a time period of over one year had lapsed between the

introduction of the 2015 Schemes of Recruitment and the calling of applications to fill

the vacancies that had arisen. In the alternative, prior to making appointments, the

Provincial Public Service Commission should have consulted the 1st Respondent, and

sought the approval of the 1st Respondent to exempt those candidates from the said

requirement, which the Provincial Public Service Commission had failed to do.

11

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that:

(a) the decision of the Provincial Public Service Commission to cancel the

promotions granted to the Petitioners, and the subsequent approval granted by

the 1st Respondent for the cancellation of the said promotions, are not arbitrary;

(b) the decision of the Provincial Public Service Commission and the 1st Respondent

is reasonable and based on discernible grounds, and is consistent with the object

of ensuring that those who are promoted have acquired the necessary

qualifications stipulated in the Schemes of Recruitment, unless an exemption had

been granted from the said requirement, taking into consideration the peculiar

circumstances that had arisen;

(c) the fundamental rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Article 12(1) of the

Constitution have not been violated by the 1st Respondent.

This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
