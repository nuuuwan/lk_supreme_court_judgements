JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC. J,

The Present appeals are concerned with the termination of employment of two

brothers who were employed by the Batticaloa Branch of the Bank of Ceylon. The

brothers were recruited by an oral agreement during the time of the armed conflict,

partly in consideration of their father being a minor employee of the bank. After the

end of the hostilities, on or about 02nd June 2011, the Appellants were informed that

their services were no longer necessary as the Bank had recruited other persons to fill

their positions. At the time both the Appellants were in their mid-twenties.

Each of them had filed separate applications before the Labour Tribunal, however,

their appeals to the High were consolidated and a common judgment was delivered

by the learned High Court judge as the facts and circumstances relating to the cases

were identical. As such, this court too considered both appeals together and are dealt

with in a single judgement.

Being aggrieved by the loss of their employment, the Appellants filed applications in

the Labour Tribunal of Batticaloa seeking reinstatement and other benefits on the basis

that the Appellants services were wrongfully and unlawfully terminated. The Labour

Tribunal by order dated 15th October 2012 ordered reinstatement with back wages

amounting to Rs. 170,100/- and that the Appellants be made permanent in their

posts. The Respondents appealed to the High Court of the Eastern Province, which by

order dated 6th June 2014, set aside the order for reinstatement, and converted the

back wages of Rs, 170,100/- to compensation. The present appeals arise from the said

judgement of the High Court.

The Appellants claim that they were permanent employees and therefore entitled to

reinstatement. The Respondent bank maintains that the Appellants were casual

employees who were employed on an ad-hoc casual basis without any contract to

carry out odd-jobs during the period of the hostilities that prevailed in that part of

4

the country because they were children of a minor employee at the bank. The

Respondent bank claims that it was unable to regularize the Appellants recruitment

after the end of the war as they had been recruited outside the normal channels. The

Respondents argue that compensation of 18 months salary i.e., one and a half years

salary is reasonable and in view of the present economic situation, has agreed to

increase the amount to Rs. 800,000/- which amounts to more than 76 months salary.

Special leave was granted on the following questions of law;

Paragraph 9

a) Did the Learned High Court Judge err in considering the law related to casual

employment?

b) Did the Learned High Court Judge err in failing to consider that the usual reliefs

for wrongful termination are reinstatement with back wages?

c) Did the Learned High Court Judge err in failing to consider that the absence of

a written contract in Industrial Law does not warrant a definite conclusion that

employment was casual in nature?

The Question of Type of Employment

The central question in this matter is whether the Appellants were casual employees,

thereby not being entitled to the right to reinstatement. In determining the type of

employment, rather than relying on the label given to the type of employment, the

Court must evaluate the nature of the actual work carried out. A person labelled as a

casual employee may very well be carrying out more responsibilities than that

characteristic of a casual employee and be expected to function in a regular capacity.

In Superintendent of Pussella State Plantation, Parakaduwa v. Sri Lanka Nidahas

Sevaka Sangamaya (1997) 1 SLR 108 the Supreme Court highlighted that a mere

label is not sufficient to classify a workman as a casual employee; if the real character

of the employment is that of a permanent employee. In National Water Supply and

Drainage Board, Regional Office, Peradeniya v. DP David and Others CA 1787/93

5

decided on 02.02.1993 it was specified that it is the duty of the court to decide the

type of the employment based on the facts rather than the label given.

The Appellants had worked at the Batticaloa Head Office, the Branch Office at

Mamangam and the Branch Office at the Railway Station. Their main duties were

those required for the orderly maintenance of the respective branches. The learned

Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent Bank, submitted a table

containing the applicable facts; the enumeration of the tasks carried out by the

Appellants as well as the chronology of the events tabulated therein, which was useful

in evaluating the employment of the Appellants to determine the type of employment.

The Appellant in SC Appeal 85/2016 was usually tasked with cleaning the branch

office, cleaning the toilets at the Station Road Branch, preparing tea and watering the

garden etc. The Appellant was further tasked with delivering cheques from one bank

to another, depositing cash in the locker in the presence of the cashier and the

Manager, arranging the cash once it arrives every month from Colombo, and pasting

damaged currency notes. His brother [SC Appeal 86/2016] similarly, was required to

clean the branch offices including the toilets and the office furniture, prepare tea,

cleaning the Managers quarters, do shopping and buying provisions needed by the

Manager and the bank staff , attending to matters connected with posting of letters by

attending to the post office. It is noteworthy that the Appellant in SC Appeal 86/2016

too, like his brother, carried out the tasks of searching for voucher bundles, checking

forms and scanning receipts of pawned jewellery which were related to the integral

activities of the bank.

The Appellants were not employed under a contract of employment nor were they

recruited through a formal process. They had been recruited during the turbulent

times due to their father being a minor employee of the bank. The Appellants position

was that they were made to understand that they would be made permanent

employees at some point in the future. The Appellants were not required sign a

register or mark attendance and were paid by voucher signed by the Manager and

the Chief Clerk as opposed to the salary being deposited in a bank account which is

6

the practice for permanent employees of the bank. The Appellants were not

considered for EPF or ETF benefits. At one point the Appellants had submitted letters

to the Respondent bank requesting that they be made permanent employees.

While the abovementioned factors indicate that the Appellants were not originally

employed on a permanent basis there are several factors that support the Appellants

proposition that they were in fact not merely casual employees. The Appellants were

paid once a week, for each day they had worked, through a voucher signed by both

the Manager and the Chief Clerk which was forwarded to the Cashier who would pay

their salaries. One of the Appellants would collect the cheques signed by the Manager.

The Appellants had reported to work regularly for a period in excess of 5 years, had

been in the practice of formally requesting for leave from the Manager by letter, had

been issued bank ID cards, had been assigned chairs to sit, were under the supervision

of the Manager and Chief Clerk when going to other banks for official purposes and

had received certificates for participating at sports events organized by the bank for

its employees. Furthermore, the former Manager had in his evidence stated that he

considered the Appellants to be essential for the smooth functioning of the bank.

When considering the nature of the responsibilities fulfilled by the Appellants and

certain practices related to the management of their employment relationship with

the bank, a considerable degree of regularity and permanence can be observed. The

Appellants reported to work daily and were paid their salary on a weekly basis. As

demonstrated by judicial precedent, uninterrupted service and a payment method

other than a daily wage payment are characteristic of the non-casual nature of the

work. This was illustrated in All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v.

Pieris ID 44 and 58 CGG 11, 471 of 05.08.1958 where the work of the employees in

question was held to be of a non-casual nature as they were paid at the end of each

week and their names kept in the check-roll unless they did not come to work for a

long period. That the workmen had come to work regularly for several years was also

considered to be a factor supporting the non-casual nature of the work.

7

Furthermore, in terms of obtaining leave the petitioner has been in the practice of

obtaining prior permission for leave through a letter addressed to the Bank Manager.

The Petitioner had also been required to report to work at a set time every day in order

to open the doors of the building. These practices negate the primary attribute of

casual employment that the employee is not mandatorily expected to report to work

every day and can take leave without prior approval as the wage is paid on a daily

basis or according to the tasks completed.

The Appellants salaries were increased from Rs. 300 per day to Rs. 350 per day. On

March 2010 a further application was made by the Manager to increase their salaries

to Rs. 450 per day. An increase in salary was considered to be an indication of non-

casual employment. In Ceylon Ceramics Corporation v. Weerasinghe SC 24-25/76

SCM 2507.78 (unrep) the Supreme Court held that the increase of the employees

salary was a factor that her employment was of a permanent nature, regardless of the

fact that in evidence she had admitted that she was employed on a casual basis as

informed by the employer.

Although the Appellants themselves had at the earlier stages considered that they were

not permanent employees, it cannot be held to militate against a finding that over time

the employment has assumed a permanent character. Here I quote with approval,

Justice R. K. S. Suresh Chandra in The Employment Relationship (scope) in Sri Lanka;

The description or designation on a document where the workman may have

agreed to be designated as a casual employee is not conclusive. The actual

relationship between the parties must be examined and if it is revealed that the

employer had treated the employee as a person with a permanent character,

then he will not be treated as a casual employee.

The impression to be had from the sum of the evidence is that the Appellants carried

out their work diligently and conscientiously and were able to handle increasing

responsibilities, which was appreciated by the bank Manager as well. Although not

tasks integral and indispensable to the principal activities of the bank, the Appellants

were held in a level of regard as to be trusted with several tasks related to the

8

transactional activities of the bank such as delivering cheques from one bank to

another. The work carried out by the Appellants enabled the smooth functioning of

the activities of the bank without any discomfort or inconvenience to the officers and

the customers.

The foregoing evaluation leads to the conclusion that although the Petitioners may

have been employed as casual employees, over time the nature of the employment

underwent such changes as to make it take a permanent form. The absence of a

written contract in itself does not warrant a definite conclusion that employment was

casual in nature.

Reinstatement or Compensation

In Meril Fernando & Co v. Deiman Singho (1988) 2 SLR 242 the rationale for

reinstatement not being available to a casual employee was explained thus;

The word casual denotes such employment as is subject to, resulting from or

occurring by chance and without regularity. By its very nature, such

employment cannot confer upon a workman a right to reinstatement as there

is no former position in which he can be placed again or a previous state to

which he can be restored, as in the case of a permanent employee.

Although the Appellants cannot be classified as casual employees, after considering

the circumstances particular to this case the court should be cautious in ordering

reinstatement. The Respondent being a financial institution, the recruitment to

various positions in all probability must be tied to requisite qualifications that

commensurate with the position. There is no material before us to say that the

Appellants possessed the requisite qualifications to join the Respondent Bank as

permanent employees. The court is mindful that the trajectory of their employment

at the bank was such as to reasonably create an expectation of being formally

employed as permanent employees in the minds of the Appellants. Furthermore, the

nature of their work was such as to transform their employment into a regular and

permanent character. However, I am of the view that the passage of more than 10

9

years since the dismissal from work, and the age of the Appellants being not so

advanced as to make it impossible to find other employment, as well as the work

carried out by the Appellants not being of a highly specialized nature which militates

against finding employment elsewhere, are practical consideration that warrant

attention in this particular case.

While the usual relief for wrongful termination is reinstatement with back wages,

compensation in lieu of reinstatement can be granted as equitable relief. Labour

Tribunals are endowed with discretion to make just and equitable orders. Justice

Kulatunga in Saleem v. Hatton National Bank [1994] 3 Sri LR 409 at page 415

identified three cardinal principles the Court has used to decide whether the order of

payment of compensation by the Labour Tribunal is possible. Those grounds which

map the parameters of the just and equitable jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal are;

the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal is wide; relief under the Industrial

Disputes Act is not limited to granting benefits which are legally due; and the

duty of the tribunal is to make the order which may appear to it to be just and

equitable.

It is in the exercise of this discretion that the Labour Tribunal of Batticaloa has found

in favour of the Appellants and ordered reinstatement and back wages. Therefore, the

Learned High Court Judge did not err in failing to consider that the usual reliefs for

wrongful termination are reinstatement with back wages.

In fairness to the Appellants, I am of the view that the compensation in the sum of

170,000/- ordered by the High Court does not sufficiently compensate for the

diligence and loyalty of the Appellants especially during the turbulent period of the

war, they had consistently and conscientiously worked and made a noteworthy

contribution enabling the Respondent to provide banking services to the public

without an interruption during that period.

Albeit on a justification other than that of the Learned Judge of the High Court of the

Eastern Province, I am inclined to uphold the grant of redress in the nature of

10

compensation. The compensation that was ordered in a sum of Rs.170,000/- by the

High Court is hereby varied and the Respondent is directed to pay a sum of Rs.

800,000/-[Rupees eight hundred thousand] to each of the Appellants. Subject to the

above variation the Appeal is dismissed.
