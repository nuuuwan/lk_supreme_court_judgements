"Furthermore, in terms of obtaining leave the petitioner has been in the practice of"
"obtaining prior permission for leave through a letter addressed to the Bank Manager."
"The Petitioner had also been required to report to work at a set time every day in order"
"to  open  the  doors  of  the  building.  These  practices  negate  the  primary  attribute  of"
"casual employment that the employee is not mandatorily expected to report to work"
"every day and can take leave without prior approval as the wage is paid on a daily"
"basis or according to the tasks completed."
"The Appellants’ salaries were increased from Rs. 300 per day to Rs. 350 per day.  On"
"March 2010 a further application was made by the Manager to increase their salaries"
"to Rs. 450 per day. An increase in salary was considered to be an indication of non-"
"casual employment. In Ceylon Ceramics Corporation v. Weerasinghe SC 24-25/76"
"SCM 2507.78 (unrep) the Supreme Court held that the increase of the employee’s"
"salary was a factor that her employment was of a permanent nature, regardless of the"
"fact that in evidence she had admitted that she was employed on a casual basis  as"
"informed by the employer."
"Although the Appellants themselves had at the earlier stages considered that they were"
"not permanent employees, it cannot be held to militate against a finding that over time"
"the  employment  has  assumed  a  permanent  character.  Here  I  quote  with  approval,"
