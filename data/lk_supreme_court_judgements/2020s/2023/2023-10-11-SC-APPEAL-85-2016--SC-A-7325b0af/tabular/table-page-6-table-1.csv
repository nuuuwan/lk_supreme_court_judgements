"the  practice 
for  permanent  employees  of 
the  bank.  The  Appellants  were  not"
"considered for EPF or ETF benefits. At one point the Appellants had submitted letters"
"to the Respondent bank requesting that they be made permanent employees."
"While  the  abovementioned  factors  indicate  that  the  Appellants  were  not  originally"
"employed on a permanent basis there are several factors that support the Appellantsâ€™"
"proposition that they were in fact not merely casual employees. The Appellants were"
"paid once a week, for each day they had worked, through a voucher signed by both"
"the Manager and the Chief Clerk which was forwarded to the Cashier who would pay"
"their salaries. One of the Appellants would collect the cheques signed by the Manager."
"The Appellants had reported to work regularly for a period in excess of 5 years, had"
"been in the practice of formally requesting for leave from the Manager by letter, had"
"been issued bank ID cards, had been assigned chairs to sit, were under the supervision"
"of the Manager and Chief Clerk when going to other banks for official purposes and"
"had received certificates for participating at sports events organized by the bank for"
"its employees. Furthermore, the former Manager had in his evidence stated that he"
"considered the Appellants to be essential for the smooth functioning of the bank."
"When considering the nature of the responsibilities fulfilled by the Appellants and"
"certain practices related to the management of their employment relationship with"
"the bank, a considerable degree of regularity and permanence can be observed. The"
"Appellants reported to work daily and were paid their salary on a weekly basis. As"
"demonstrated  by  judicial  precedent,  uninterrupted  service  and  a  payment  method"
"other than a daily wage payment are characteristic of the non-casual nature of the"
"work. This was illustrated in All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v."
"P
i
eris ID 44 and 58 CGG 11, 471 of 05.08.1958 where the work of the employees in"
"question was held to be of a non-casual nature as they were paid at the end of each"
"week and their names kept in the check-roll unless they did not come to work for a"
"long period. That the workmen had come to work regularly for several years was also"
"considered to be a factor supporting the non-casual nature of the work."
