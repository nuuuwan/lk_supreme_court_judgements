"It was held in Piyasiri v Fernando [1981]1 Sri L.R 173 at 184 that an arrest would be"
"illegal if the arrest was based on speculation or a vague and general suspicion or effected"
"to ascertain whether some offence was committed. His Lordship Justice H.A.G De Silva"
"held that;"
"“The arrest of the Petitioners in my view was highly speculative and was for the purpose"
"o
f
 ascertaining whether any of them-could be detected to, have committed a bribery"
"o
f
f
ence. No Police Officer has the right to arrest a person on vague general suspicion, not"
"knowing -the precise crime suspected but hoping to obtain evidence of the commission"
"o
f
 
some crime for which they have the power to arrest.”"
"In Piyasiri v Fernando [Supra], the Bribery Commissioner received a complaint alleging"
"that the Customs Officers at the airport were soliciting bribes. It was a general complaint"
"without identifying any particular Customs Officers and the Respondent Police Officers"
"effected  the  arrest  once  the  Customs  Officers  were  leaving  the  airport.  Therefore,  the"
"Court held that the Police Officers acted on a vague and general suspicion."
"However,  in  the  instant  Application,  the  Mount  Lavinia  Police  Station  received  24"
"complaints from 25.04.2015 to 28.04.2015 marked “3R5 to 3Rw” and all the complaints"
"alleged  that  the  Training  Center  ceased  to  be  duly  registered  with  TVEC  and  stood"
"terminated since 20.12.2013, and that the monies of the students were misappropriated."
"The 
letters  dated  12.05.2015  and  15.09.2015,  provided  by 
the  Acting  Director"
"(Standards and Accreditation) of the TVEC, although issued after the Petitioner's arrest,"
"marked as “3R1 and 3R1a” provide credit to the Respondents’ stance that the Training"
"Center’s valid registration had ceased."
"While I would not definitively settle the matter that the Training Center was conducting"
"its  business 
illegally,  within 
the  context  of 
this  case, 
the  Court  concurs 
that 
the"
"Respondents  held  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  Training  Center  was  engaged  in"
"unlawful operations. It is also pertinent that of the 24 complaints, the complaints marked"
"“3R5f, 3R5h, 3R5j to 3R5n, 3R5p, 3R5q, 3R5u, 3R5v”  made specific references to the"
"Petitioner  by  name  and  identified  her  as  the  Office  Coordinator/Manager  or  as  an"
"employee of the Training Center."
