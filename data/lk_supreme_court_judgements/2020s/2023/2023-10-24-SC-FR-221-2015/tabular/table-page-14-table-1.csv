"“Suspicion in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is"
"l
acking: 'I suspect but I cannot prove'. Suspicion arises at or near the starting point of an"
"i
nvestigation of which the obtaining of prima facie proof is the end”."
"However,  the  suspicion  of  the  Police  Officer  must  be  reasonable,  and  a  Police  Officer"
"cannot act on mere conjecture or surmise. As stated by His Lordship Justice Amarasinghe"
"in Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney General and Others [1994] 1 Sri L.R 1 at p. 46"

"“A reasonable suspicion may be based either upon matters within the officer’s knowledge"
"or upon credible information furnished to him, or upon a combination of both sources.”"
"“However, the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion founded on mere"
"conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion"
"t
hat the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could have"
"arrested a person without a warrant. The suspicion must not be of an uncertain and"
"vague nature but of a positive and definite character providing reasonable ground for"
"suspecting that the person arrested was concerned in the commission of an offence”."
"Similarly, in Gamlath v Neville Silva and Others [1991] 2 Sri L.R 267 it was held by His"
"Lordship Justice Kulatunga that;"
"“A suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was founded on matters"

"way which justify him giving them credit.”"
"A Police Officer must form a reasonable suspicion founded upon his own knowledge such"
"as personally observing the commission of an Offence or by statements made by others"
"in  a  manner  which  justifies  him  giving  credit  to  those  statements.  For  instance,  if  the"
"statements are corroborated by additional evidence or if there are a number of complaints"
"received by the Police Officer corroborating the same events, or by a combination of both"
"personal knowledge of the Police Officer and credible statements made by others."
"Plainly, the threshold for the foundation of a reasonable suspicion is limited and must be"
"assessed  on  the  facts  of  each  case  and  suspecting  a  person  of  having  committed  an"
"Offence falls a short of having demonstrable proof of the commission of the Offence."
