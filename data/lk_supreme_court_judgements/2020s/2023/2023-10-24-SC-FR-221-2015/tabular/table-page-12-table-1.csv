"degree  of  probability  to  be  established,  and  an  allegation  based  on  the  word  of  the"
"Petitioner  alone  may  not  suffice.  It  was  also  alleged  by  the  Petitioner  that  the  2nd"
"Respondent sought a “favour” on 24.05.2015 and requested transport to visit a funeral."
"The  alleged  transcript  and  the  voice  recording  marked  “P  40(y)”  and  “P  40(z)”  are"
"denied  by  the  2nd  Respondent.  In  the  absence  of  any  voice  comparison,  specialist"
"comparison or expert evidence to corroborate the alleged “favour”, the Court is hesitant"
"to rely on the recording alone produced by the Petitioner."
"Moreover, if the 2nd Respondent attempted to solicit a bribe, the Petitioner could have"
"made a complaint to the relevant authorities, but no such attempt was made. Further, the"
"alleged bribe is  not  mentioned in  the complaint  made  by  the  Petitioner to  the Human"
"Rights  Commission marked “P 41”, and in  fact, the alleged events of 26.04.2015  and"
"24.05.2015 are completely omitted from the complaint. Although the complaint on its"
"face is dated 24.05.2015, even the Petitioner accepts that the complaint was made on the"
"27.05.2015. The Petitioner has not provided reason as to why the Petitioner omitted to"
"state these events.  In those circumstances, I find that the Petitioner has failed to establish"
"a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Alleged Violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution"
"Article  13(1)  of  the  Constitution  ensures  that  the  personal  liberties  of  a  person  are"
"protected from arbitrary arrest. The obligations enshrined in Article 13(1) are twofold."
"First, is that an arrest must be made in accordance with the procedure established by law"
"and secondly, every person arrested must be informed of the reason for the arrest."
"Justice Sharvananda states the purpose to inform the reason for the arrest in his treatise,"
