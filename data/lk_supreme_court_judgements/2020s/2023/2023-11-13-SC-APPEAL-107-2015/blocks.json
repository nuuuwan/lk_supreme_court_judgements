I am therefore in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff, and take the view that the entering of the decree in 1963 in the MB action did not take away the title that the Plaintiffs father had to Manomani Estate. Thus, when the Law came into force, title to Manomani Estate remained with the Plaintiffs father, subject to the mortgage and the decree. Is a decree entered in a hypothecary action an encumbrance for the purposes of the Law? Even though the issue whether a decree entered in a mortgage action is an encumbrance for the purposes of the Law was raised by the Defendant as Issue No. 11 and has been answered by the District Court in favour of the Plaintiff, the said issue has not been addressed by the High Court. I have already referred to Section 3(2) of the Law in terms of which all agricultural land in excess of the ceiling was deemed to vest in the Commission. The effect of such vesting is reflected in Section 6 which provides that, Where any agricultural land is vested in the Commission under this Law, such vesting shall have the effect of giving the Commission absolute title to such land as from the date of such vesting, and free from all encumbrances. [emphasis added] What existed at the time the Law came into force was the mortgage, and the decree in the MB action filed to enforce the mortgage, but with an appeal made in respect of the judgment from which the decree arose. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that, (a) on the date that the Law came into operation [26th August 1972], the legal owner of Manomani Estate was the Plaintiffs father, although encumbered by the mortgage which was the subject matter of the hypothecary action, (b) the Plaintiffs father was therefore required by the Law to declare his ownership in Manomani Estate, and (c) in view of Section 6, Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of all encumbrances, including the mortgage and the decree entered in the MB action. It was therefore his position that although decree had been entered, given the fact that the MB action was only a hypothecary action, the mortgage was very much alive at the time the Law came into force, and that the mortgage and the decree are encumbrances for the purposes of Section 6.",

    "text": "The view that the mortgage as well as the decree are encumbrances over the land is supported by the meaning attached to \"incumbrance\" in Misso v Hadjear [19 NLR 277 at page 278] where De Sampayo, J stated that, In the largest sense it means any kind of burden on or diminution of the title, and in a narrower sense it is generally employed to indicate a mortgage or charge upon the property. In Sarvanamuttu v Solamuttu [26 NLR 385; at page 389] Bertram, CJ stated that a mortgage decree does affect the land in the sense of it investing a person with an interest in the land or imposing or creating some charge, interest, or liability which would operate prejudicially to the title of any subsequent purchaser. I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff that as the MB action was only a hypothecary action, the mortgage retained its character without any transformation, even though decree had been entered, and that as at the date of the Law coming into force, the mortgage was very much in existence, although subject to the decree. I am therefore of the view that the aforementioned mortgage and decree are encumbrances on Manomani Estate and were subject to the provisions of the Law. Does Section 6 of the Law apply only while land is deemed vested in the Commission? Referring to Section 6, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the title to Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of encumbrances and that Section 6 had the effect of completely wiping out the mortgage and the decree. He therefore submitted that with the mortgage and decree having been wiped out, Manomani Estate could not have been sold at a public auction in satisfaction of a decree which no longer had any legal validity and therefore no title could have passed to the person who bought Manomani Estate at the auction [in this case the mortgagees] and consequently no title passed to the Defendant. I agree that with the application of Section 6, title to Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of the mortgage suit and the decree, but subject to the caveat that it would continue to be so only so far as the land remained vested in the Commission or where the Commission alienated the land to a third party in terms of the Law. In other words, if Manomani Estate which was deemed vested in the Commission was to revert",

Thus, in such circumstances there is no wiping out of the mortgage. What takes place is that in terms of Section 6, Manomani Estate was deemed vested in the Commission free of all encumbrances and would continue to be so, with the encumbrance floating over Manomani Estate, only for it to be attached to the land once again in the event of Manomani Estate or part thereof being returned to the Plaintiffs father. This is clearly further borne out by the provisions of Section 27B introduced by the Land Reform (Special Provisions) Act, No. 39 of 1981, to which I will advert to later in this judgment. Did the Plaintiff derive the title of her father or that of the Commission? The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that with the coming into operation of the Law and with land over and above the ceiling deemed to have been vested in the Commission free of any encumbrance, the Plaintiffs father lost his title to the mortgaged property and was transformed into a statutory lessee. He therefore submitted that when the Plaintiffs father executed Deed No. 2085, he did so not as the owner of Manomani Estate which was subject to a mortgage but as the statutory lessee of a land that was no longer encumbered. He submitted further that with Manomani Estate being deemed vested in the Commission in 1972, the Plaintiff derived her title to 25 acres of Manomani Estate not from her father but from the Commission, and most importantly, free of any encumbrance. I am unable to agree with this argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff. Although in terms of Section 3(2), all agricultural lands in excess of the ceiling are deemed to have vested in the Commission on the day the Law came into operation by way of a legal fiction, as I have already stated, for the purposes of this case, that vesting is subject to: (a) a statutory determination of the land area amounting to 50 acres that an owner",

What the Commission did in terms of the Order made under Section 14(2) was grant approval to the owner to transfer land to his children, which is a further manifestation of the concept of the land being merely deemed vested in the Commission. In doing so, the Commission revived the title of the owner to that portion of land for which approval was being granted, while simultaneously removing his status as statutory lessee, thereby enabling the land be transferred to his children. This is reflected in the wording of Section 14(3), as well as by the fact that the Deed of Gift was executed by the Plaintiffs father and not by the Commission. Thus, I am of the view that the Plaintiff in this case derived her title from her father and not from the Commission. Having said so, I must reiterate that the benefit of title vesting free of any encumbrances, as provided by Section 6, has only been conferred upon the Commission, and that when the Commission grants approval in terms of Section 14(2) for an inter-family transfer, the title that the beneficiaries of such transfer receive is not the unencumbered title of the Commission but the title of the person who owned the land at the time the Law came into force, including any encumbrance that may have existed at the time in respect of such land. Indeed, this is the process of re-attachment of an encumbrance that I have discussed earlier. In other words, the Plaintiff derived her title to 25 acres of Manomani Estate from her father subject to the mortgage executed by her father and the decree in the MB action. To hold otherwise would mean that an encumbered title can be cleared of such encumbrances via the Law for the benefit of its owner, who could thereby evade his or her obligations and liabilities under a mortgage or any other encumbrance. This certainly would not have been the intention of the legislature when the Law was enacted, in spite of the apparent consensus that landowners losing vast tracts of land overnight be given certain concessions such as inter-family transfers of land over the stipulated ceiling. The above position is confirmed by: (a) the latter part of Section 12 of the Law, to which I shall advert; and",

It is clear that in terms of Section 12(1), a mortgagee has a claim on the compensation that is payable to the mortgagor. However, this was not in issue before the District Court and therefore there is no evidence before this Court indicating whether compensation was in fact paid to the Plaintiffs father for the balance part of Manomani Estate that vested with the Commission. Although the said Section further provides that where such amount of compensation is not sufficient to meet the mortgagees claim, the mortgagee can enforce his or her rights over the 50 acres of land that is released to the owner from the mortgaged land, this will not apply in the present case as no part of Manomani Estate remained with the Plaintiffs father.",

Did Section 27B(1) apply with retrospective effect? The necessity to consider the application of Section 27B, introduced by Section 8 of Act No. 39 of 1981, and forming the basis of the question of law raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant, does not arise in view of the above conclusion that the title of the Plaintiff is subject to the mortgage and the decree.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant that in terms of Section 27B(1) the mortgage that was executed over Manomani Estate on 1st February 1948 by Mortgage Bond No. 3514, and which mortgage stood suppressed while the land was deemed vested in the Commission, was revived when the Commission made its Order under Section 14(2) on 10th June 1974, with effect from such date. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff however submitted that Section 27B(1) applies only in respect of an order made after Act No. 39 of 1981 was enacted into law and that Section 27B(1) does not apply with retrospective effect. He accordingly submitted that as the Order under Section 14(2) was made in June 1974 and Deed No. 2085, by which the Plaintiff derived her title, was executed in 1980, prior to Act No. 39 of 1981, the provisions of Section 27B has no application in this case. I am attracted by the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff for two reasons. The first is that Act No. 39 of 1981 introduced detailed provisions that permitted land owners to make applications seeking approval to effect further inter-family transfers, in spite of the 3 month time limit imposed by the principal enactment for such applications. The second is that while Section 27B has been introduced by Section 8 of Act No. 39 of 1981, Section 16 of that Act only provides that, The amendments made to the principal enactment by section 2 (a), 12 and 15 of this Act shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into operation on the date of commencement of the principal enactment. I am however mindful that in Jinawathie [supra; at page 139] it was held that, an encumbrance which subsisted over and in respect of the plaintiff-respondent's undivided shares in the larger land would, from and after the date on which P6 came into operation, be revived and attach to the land described in P6. P6 is the statutory determinaon in Jinawathie and was dated 25th September 1974, and so it seems that the ve Judge Bench of this Court in Jinawathie has considered, despite not explicitly spelling it out, that Secon 27B does have retrospecve operaon.

Conclusion Thus, the mortgage over Manomani Estate, effected in 1948, which was sought to be enforced through the MB action from 1956, which continued following the entering of the decree in 1963 until the introduction of the Law in 1972, and which stood suppressed while Manomani Estate was vested in the Commission, completed its full circle when the Order under Section 14(2) was made in 1974 in favour of the Plaintiffs father, thereby reviving the mortgage and the decree. I am of the view that the title the Plaintiff acquired in terms of Deed No. 2085 was that of her fathers and was therefore subject to the mortgage and the decree. With this Court having dismissed the appeal against the MB action in July 1974, and part of the land having been returned to the Plaintiffs father to be transferred to the Plaintiff and her sister, the mortgagees had every right to enforce the decree in respect of that part of the land, which was duly done in November 1983. Upon such execution of the decree, the Plaintiff lost her title to the 25 acres of land in Manomani Estate referred to in Deed No. 2085 and the Defendant simultaneously acquired title to a part of Manomani Estate, through Deed No. 1341. I am therefore of the view that the Plaintiff had no title to the land referred to in the plaint when she instituted District Court Case No. 10650/L, while the Defendant had title to such land by virtue of Deed No. 1341. The Plaintiff is therefore not entitled to the relief prayed for in the plaint.
