"hands of the owner to be retained or transferred to a child or parent, and is free of the"
"encumbrance only when such land is in the hands of the Commission or is alienated by"
"the Commission to a third party in terms of the Law."
"I
t was the position of the learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant that in terms of"
"Section 27B(1) the mortgage that was executed over Manomani Estate on 1st February"
"1948 by Mortgage Bond No. 3514, and which mortgage stood suppressed while the land"
"was deemed vested in the Commission, was revived when the Commission made its Order"
"under Section 14(2) on 10th June 1974, with effect from such date. The learned President’s"
"Counsel for the Plaintiff however submitted that Section 27B(1) applies only in respect of"
"an order made after Act No. 39 of 1981 was enacted into law and that Section 27B(1) does"
"not  apply  with  retrospective  effect.  He accordingly submitted  that  as the  Order under"
"Section 14(2) was made in June 1974 and Deed No. 2085, by which the Plaintiff derived"
"her title, was executed in 1980, prior to Act No. 39 of 1981, the provisions of Section 27B"
"has no application in this case."
"I
 am attracted by the submission of the learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff for"
"two  reasons.  The  first  is  that  Act  No.  39  of  1981  introduced  detailed  provisions  that"
"permitted  land  owners  to  make  applications  seeking  approval  to  effect  further  inter-"
"family transfers, in spite of the 3 month time limit imposed by the principal enactment"
"for such applications. The second is that while Section 27B has been introduced by Section"
"8 of Act No. 39 of 1981, Section 16 of that Act only provides that, “The amendments made"
"to the principal enactment by section 2 (a), 12 and 15 of this Act shall be deemed for all"
"purposes  to  have  come  into  operation  on  the  date  of  commencement  of  the  principal"
"enactment.”"
"I
  am  however  mindful  that  in  Jinawathie  [supra;  at  page  139]  it  was  held  that,  “…  an"
"encumbrance which subsisted over and in respect of the plaintiff-respondent's undivided"
"shares in the larger land would, from and after the date on which P6 came into operation,"
"be revived and attach to the land described in P6.”"
"P
6 is the statutory determina(cid:415)on in Jinawathie and was dated 25th September 1974, and"
"so it seems that the ﬁve Judge Bench of this Court in Jinawathie has considered, despite"
"not explicitly spelling it out, that Sec(cid:415)on 27B does have retrospec(cid:415)ve opera(cid:415)on. However,"
