"the questions of law to be determined in this appeal, namely (a) the requirement for an"
"owner of agricultural land above the ceiling to submit a “statutory declaration”, (b) the"
"option available to such an owner to seek land over and above the ceiling for children"
"over  the  age  of  eighteen,  and  (c)  the  “statutory  determination”  that  is  made  by  the"
