Obeyesekere, J

This appeal arises from a judgment delivered by the Provincial High Court of the Southern

Province holden in Galle [the High Court] on 17th March 2014, by which the High Court

upheld the judgment of the District Court of Galle [the District Court] dated 22nd February

2006 dismissing the plaint. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plain Appellant

Appellant [the Plain] led a peon of appeal before this Court on 4th April 2014

seeking leave to appeal from the said judgment. On 28th January 2015, leave to appeal

was granted on the quesons of law set out in paragraph 14(b) (m) of the said peon

and one queson of law raised on behalf of the Defendant Respondent Respondent

[the Defendant].

Facts in brief

The Plains father, the late Jusn De Silva Warnakulasuriya Goonewardena was the

owner of two agricultural lands in Galle. One was Manomani Estate in extent of 145 acres

and part of which is the subject maer of this appeal. The other was Upper Langsland

Estate in extent of 317 acres.

The following maers were recorded as admissions at the commencement of the District

Court trial on 24th January 1992:

a) The Plains father had mortgaged Manomani Estate by way of Mortgage Bond No.

3514 executed on 1st February 1948 to Sumanawathie Weerapperuma and Don

Frederick Subasinghe [the mortgagees] as a security for a loan given by the

mortgagees;

b) Upon the Plains father defaulng on the payment of the moneys borrowed, the

mortgagees had led Case No. MB 1218 in the District Court of Galle against the

Plains father [the MB acon]. Aer trial, judgment had been entered in favour of

the mortgagees on 25th October 1963 and decree had accordingly been entered on

18th December 1963;

4

c) The appeal preferred against the said judgment of the District Court by the Plains

father had been dismissed by this Court on 5th July 1974;

d) The Plains father [mortgagor] had objected to the mortgagees applicaon for

the enforcement of the decree but the said objecon had been overruled by the

District Court by its Order delivered on 22nd November 1983;

e) On 24th November 1983, the said decree had been executed and Manomani Estate

which was the subject maer of the MB acon, had been sold by public aucon,

with it being purchased by the mortgagees. Manomani Estate had accordingly been

transferred to the mortgagees by a Fiscal conveyance on 27th June 1984 by Deed of

Transfer No. 1339 and on the same day, the mortgagees had transferred the same to

the Defendant by Deed of Transfer No. 1341.

Although it had been admitted that Manomani Estate had been transferred in its entirety

to the Defendant, the evidence led at the trial was that pursuant to the sale, the

mortgagees had sub-divided the land into several lots and what had been transferred to

the Defendant was only a part thereof, as described in the schedule to Deed No. 1341. Be

that as it may, on the face of it, with the execution of the decree and the Fiscals

conveyance as aforesaid, neither the Plaintiff nor her father could have claimed any

ownership to Manomani Estate or any part thereof.

The Land Reform Law

I say on the face of it for the reason that the primary issue that needs to be determined in

this appeal is whether the Plain has tle to that part of Manomani Estate referred to in

the schedule to the plaint, in spite of the execuon of the decree in the MB acon and

the Fiscals conveyance. This issue arose due to the fact that while the appeal from the

District Court in the MB acon was pending, the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972 was

introduced, and as a result of the applicaon of certain provisions of the said Law and

steps taken in terms of the said Law, an extent of 25 acres from Manomani Estate was

gied to the Plain by her father in 1980, thus conferring the Plain tle in respect of

such poron of Manomani Estate.

5

The Land Reform Law [the Law] is the first law enacted under the First Republican

Constitution of 1972 by the National State Assembly, and came into operation on 26th

August 1972. In its long title, the said Law was stated to be, "A Law to establish a Land

Reform Commission, to fix a ceiling on the extent of agricultural land that may be owned

by persons, to provide for the vesting of lands owned in excess of such ceiling in the Land

Reform Commission, and for such land to be held by the former owners on a statutory

lease from the Commission, to prescribe the purposes and the manner of disposition by

the Commission of agricultural lands vested in the Commission so as to increase

productivity and employment, to provide for the payment of compensation to persons

deprived of their lands under this Law and for matters connected therewith or incidental

thereto.

Section 2 of the said Law provides that the objects of the Land Reform Commission [the

Commission] was inter alia to ensure that no person shall own agricultural land in excess

of the ceiling set out in Section 3(1), which Section reads as follows:

On and after the date of commencement of this Law the maximum extent of

agricultural land which may be owned by any person, in this Law referred to as the

"ceiling", shall:

(a) if such land consists exclusively of paddy land, be twenty-five acres; or

(b) if such land does not consist exclusively of paddy land, be fifty acres, so however

that the total extent of any paddy land, if any, comprised in such fifty acres

shall not exceed the ceiling on paddy land specified in paragraph (a).

[emphasis added]

Section 3(2) provides further as follows:

Any agricultural land owned by any person in excess of the ceiling on the date of

commencement of this Law shall as from that date

(a) be deemed to vest in the Commission; and

6

(b) be deemed to be held by such person under a statutory lease from the

Commission. [emphasis added]

In terms of Section 6 of the Law, Where any agricultural land is vested in the Commission

under this Law, such vesting shall have the effect of giving the Commission absolute title

to such land as from the date of such vesting, and free from all encumbrances.

[emphasis added]

Determination of the land that is to vest in the Commission

The cumulative effect of Sections 3 and 6 is that from the date of commencement of the

Law, the maximum extent of agricultural land that could be owned by an individual is 50

acres with any land in excess of this ceiling being deemed vested in the Commission. The

exact land area amounting to 50 acres of agricultural land that a person is permitted to

own and in turn, the exact metes and bounds of the remaining agricultural land that was

deemed to vest in the Commission was to be determined in terms of the Law. In other

words, although in terms of Section 3(2), all agricultural lands owned by an individual over

and above the ceiling were deemed to vest in the Commission, until the procedure

stipulated in the Law for determining the exact land area forming the 50 acres that a

person was entitled to elect to keep for himself was completed, it was not possible to

determine exactly which land portion overshot the 50 acre ceiling and had therefore

vested in the Commission.

The legal fiction of introducing a deemed concept in Section 3 was to ensure that (a) any

person who owned more land than the 50 acre ceiling could not alienate such agricultural

land pending a determination in terms of the Law of the precise land that was to be

retained by such person, and (b) until such time, the entire land was deemed to vest in

the Commission.

The concept of deemed vested was considered by a bench of ve Judges of this Court in

Jinawathie and Others v Emalin Perera [(1986) 2 Sri LR 121] where Parinda Ranasinghe, J

[as he then was] stated as follows:

7

A careful consideraon of the provisions of the Land Reform Law , in their proper

sequence shows that, with the coming into operaon of the said provisions, on

26.8.1972, the enrety of the agricultural land owned by a person, who is entled to

more than y acres, has to be deemed to vest immediately in the Commission; that

what is so deemed to vest, vests absolutely free from all encumbrances; that

thenceforth the person who owned such land is deemed to be a statutory lessee of

the Commission upon the terms and condions set out; [page 126]

As has been set out above, where an agricultural land becomes subject to the

provisions of this Law in consequence of its owner being one who is entled to land

over and above the ceiling, such agricultural land is "deemed" to vest in the

Commission, and its owner is "deemed" to be a statutory lessee of such land. It is,

therefore, necessary to examine the nature and scope, in law, of such a deeming

provision as secon 3(2) of this Law. In statutes the expression "deemed" is

commonly used for the purpose of creang a statutory funcon so that the meaning

of a term is extended to a subject maer which it properly does not designate. Thus

where a person is "deemed to be something" it only means that whereas he is not in

reality that something the Act of Parliament requires him to be treated as if he were.

When a thing is deemed to be something, it does not mean that it is that which it is

deemed to be, but it is rather an admission that it is not what it is deemed to be, and

that notwithstanding it is not that parcular thing it is nevertheless deemed to be

that thing. Where a statute declares that a person or thing shall be deemed to be or

shall be treated as something which in reality it is not, it shall have to be treated as

so during the enre course of the proceeding-vide Bindra: Interpretaon of Statutes

(6th Ed.) pp. 912-914. [page 130]

Keeping in mind one of the questions of law that needs to be determined in this appeal, I

should perhaps mention at this stage that the Law further provided for any person who

became a statutory lessee to make an application in terms of Section 14 seeking the

return to such statutory lessee [i.e., to the owner], agricultural land that was over and

above the ceiling stipulated in Section 3(1) in order that the said land be transferred to

such persons children who were over eighteen years of age or such persons parents.

8

Therefore, (a) until the exact 50 acre parcel of agricultural land that a person could retain

was determined in terms of the Law, and (b) where an application had been made in

terms of Section 14, until the process stipulated thereunder was completed, it was not

possible to say which exact portion of the excess agricultural land held by an individual

would in fact vest in the Commission, despite the law providing that all lands in excess of

the ceiling were deemed to vest in the Commission from the date of commencement of

the said Law.

The role of the statutory lessee

In terms of Sections 15 of the Law, while the land remained vested with the Commission

pending the above, the owner of the land, who in terms of the Law had transformed into

the role of a statutory lessee, was responsible for the management of the agricultural

land once owned by him. The so created statutory lease was to continue for one year

from the date of vesting, with provision for the extension of such period for a further one

year at the discretion of the Commission. However, no such statutory lease could be

continued for any further period by the Commission, except with the express approval of

the Minister.

Thus, in terms of the Law, until such time a determination was made with regard to the

50 acres of agricultural land that a person could retain and the exclusion of any land that

an owner would be allowed to transfer to children or parents pursuant to an application

under Section 14, the agricultural land belonging to an individual to whom Section 3

applied, was deemed vested with the Commission. Furthermore, until such time a suitable

entity was identified to manage the said lands, which period was limited to two years, the

management was to remain with the individual or company that owned such land, on the

basis of a statutory lease. The role of the Commission was that of a repository of lands

that were deemed vested in the Commission in terms of the Law from the date of

commencement of the Law until inter alia the land was returned to the owner or suitable

persons were identified to manage the said lands or the lands were alienated or otherwise

allocated in accordance with the Law.

9

I shall now consider three important provisions of the Law which are directly referable to

the questions of law to be determined in this appeal, namely (a) the requirement for an

owner of agricultural land above the ceiling to submit a statutory declaration, (b) the

option available to such an owner to seek land over and above the ceiling for children

over the age of eighteen, and (c) the statutory determination that is made by the

Commission pursuant to the submission of the said statutory declaration.

The statutory declaration

The mechanism to decide which 50 acres of agricultural land a person who owned more

than the ceiling was entitled to retain, has been set out in Section 18(1), which reads as

follows:

The Commission may, by Order published in the Gazette and in such other form as

it may deem desirable to give publicity to such Order, direct that every person who

becomes the statutory lessee of any agricultural land shall, within a month from the

date of the publication of the Order, or of becoming a statutory lessee under this

Law make a declaration, in this Law referred to as a " statutory declaration ", in the

prescribed form of the total extent of the agricultural land so held by him on such

lease.

While Section 18(2) stipulates the matters that a declaration under Section 18(1) shall

contain, in terms of paragraph (f) thereof, the statutory lessee was required to specify

the preference or preferences, if any, of the declarant as to the particular portion or

portions of each such land which he should be allowed to retain. Thus began the process

of identifying the land that was to ultimately vest in the Commission, once all exemptions

and permitted transfers under the Law had been entertained.

It is admitted that the Plaintiffs father made two statutory declarations on 20th November

1972 in which he declared Manomani Estate and Upper Langsland Estate as being

agricultural lands owned by him. In the said declarations, the Plaintiffs father had

declared that, (a) he wishes to retain as his entitlement in terms of the Law, land from the

Upper Langsland Estate, and (b) there existed a mortgage in respect of Manomani Estate

10

which was subject to the MB action. He had however failed to mention that decree had

already been entered in the MB action.

Section 14 of the Law

It is admitted that the Plaintiff was one of several children of Justin De Silva

Warnakulasuriya Goonewardena.

Section 14(1) provides that, Any person who becomes a statutory lessee of any

agricultural land under this Law may within three months from such date make an

application to the Commission in the prescribed form for the transfer by way of sale, gift,

exchange or otherwise of the entirety or portion of such agricultural land to any child

who is eighteen years of age or over or to a parent of such person. [emphasis added]

Acting in terms of the above Section, the Plaintiffs father had made an application that

he be permitted to transfer out of the two Estates, 50 acres per child to each of his

children who by then were all between the ages of 19 and 32.

In terms of Section 14(2), The Commission may by order made under its hand grant or

refuse to grant approval for such transfer. Such order shall be made within one year of

the date of application under subsection (1). Every such order shall be sent by registered

post to the applicant under subsection (1). Any such applicant aggrieved by the order may

appeal to the Minister within three weeks of the receipt of such order. The receipt of the

order shall be deemed to be effected at the time at which letters would be delivered in the

ordinary course of post. [emphasis added]

Although the said application had initially been rejected, pursuant to an appeal to the

Minister, the Commission, by its letter dated 31st December 1973 had informed the

Plaintiffs father that approval had been granted to transfer 25 acres each, to each of his

children. This included two 25 acre lots from Manomani Estate, which by then formed

part of the subject matter of the decree issued in the MB action, but which fact (i.e., of

the decree) had not been disclosed to the Commission. It must perhaps be noted that in

terms of Section 18(5), making a declaration knowing such declaration to be false is an

11

offence and the Commission was empowered to forfeit the compensation payable under

the Law.

The formal Order of the Commission granting its approval was conveyed to the Plaintiffs

father by letter dated 10th June 1974. The said Order contained the steps to be followed

by the Plaintiffs father in transferring the land to the Plaintiff and her sister, including the

requirement to have a survey plan prepared and to submit to the Commission a copy of

the deed of transfer upon its execution.

In terms of Section 14(3), Any transfer effected in accordance with the provisions of an

order made under subsection (2) or such order as amended, varied or modified on appeal

shall have the effect of transferring right, title or interest in property so transferred free

of the statutory lease. [emphasis added]

Thus, once the approval of the Commission was received, the transfer was to be effected

by the applicant in favour of his or her child, and not by the Commission. In the process,

the applicant ceased to be a statutory lessee of such land that was to be transferred.

Accordingly, by Deed of Transfer No. 2085 dated 16th August 1980 executed by the

Plaintiffs father, 25 acres each from Manomani Estate were transferred to the Plaintiff

and her sister. This is borne out by the contents of the said Deed which clearly state that

the Plaintiff is receiving the title of her father.

While I shall elaborate later on in this judgment, I must state at this point that:

(a) it is not the Commission that transferred the impugned land to the Plaintiff but her

own father; and

(b) what was transferred to the Plaintiff was the title that the Plaintiffs father had in

the said land at the time the Law came into force, and therefore free of the statutory

lease to which the Plaintiffs fathers rights over the land had been reduced to in

terms of Section 3 of the Law.

Thus, although the Plaintiffs father was only entitled to 50 acres in terms of the Law, the

Commission had granted him approval to transfer a further 175 acres to his children,

12

obviously not as a statutory lessee but as the owner who was capable of such dispositions.

The Plaintiff thus acquired title over that part of Manomani Estate referred to in Deed No.

2085, and morefully set out in the schedule to the plaint, subject to the encumbrances

that existed over her fathers title to the said land.

Statutory Determination

It is only thereafter that the Commission, acting in terms of Section 19 of the Law,

published its Statutory Determination in Extraordinary Gazette No. 196/2 dated 29th

December 1975 declaring that the Plaintiffs father is allowed to retain 50 acres of land

from Upper Langsland Estate.

The effect of a statutory determination is set out in Section 20 in the following manner:

Every statutory determination published in the Gazette under section 19 shall come

into operation on the date of such publication and the Commission shall have no

right, title or interest in the agricultural land specified in the statutory determination

from the date of such publication. [emphasis added]

In Jinawathie and Others v Emalin Perera [supra; at page 139] this Court had held that:

P6 the statutory determinaon in this case states, as set out earlier, that the

plain-respondent shall be allowed to retain the said extent of land referred to in

the schedule to P6, and also fully described in the schedule to the plaint in this case.

The eect of such a statutory determinaon, upon its publicaon in the Gazee, is

set out in this Law itself, in Secon 20. All that is stated therein is that the

Commission shall have no right, tle or interest in the agricultural land specied in

the statutory determinaon from the date of such publicaon. It is merely a

renunciaon of all interests on the part of the Commission. There is, in P6, no

express vesng or conferment of tle in the plain-respondent, who is referred to

in P6 as the statutory lessee, in respect of the Land referred to in P6 and described in

P6 as the poron of agricultural land owned by the statutory lessee and which she

shall be allowed to retain.

13

What then is the eect, in law, of the plain-respondent being allowed to retain

the land described in the schedule to P6-which is also, as set out already, the land

more fully described in the schedule to the plaint-and further referred to as a poron

of agricultural land owned by the statutory lessee? The order embodied in P6 is

made as the nal act in the process of ensuring that no person (plain-respondent)

shall own agricultural land in excess of the ceiling (50 acres) vide Secon 2(a).

[emphasis added]

It was further stated [at page 141] that:

the person, in whose favour a statutory determination is made, would, upon

the making of such a determination, become possessed of those attributes viz: the

right to possess, to take the income, and to deal with it in any way, including

alienation and even destruction, so long as it is not illegal, which are, in law, the

essence of ownership.

It must be emphasised that by the time the aforesaid Deed No. 2085 was executed, the

appeal in the MB action had been dismissed by this Court, but this fact had not been

disclosed to the Commission. Accordingly, the said inter-family transfer pertained to a

portion of a land which, in terms of Section 2 of the Mortgage Act No. 6 of 1949, was

bound by an order of Court and liable to judicial sale to enforce payment due upon the

mortgage. Be that as it may, the decree in the MB action was executed and Manomani

Estate was sold at a public auction in November 1983, with it being purchased by the

mortgagees themselves, who in turn sold part of the said land to the Defendant, with

Deed of Transfer No. 1341 being executed in June 1984.

Action in the District Court

Thus, by June 1984, the Plaintiff had a deed in her favour in respect of 25 acres of

Manomani Estate, namely Deed No. 2085 executed in 1980 in terms of the Law, while the

Defendant too held Deed No. 1341 in respect of a part of Manomani Estate pursuant to a

Fiscals conveyance executed in 1984. Having purchased part of Manomani Estate, the

Defendant had soon thereafter taken possession of the land she had purchased.

14

It is in this background that by plaint dated 13th June 1985, the Plaintiff instituted a rei

vindicatio action against the Defendant in respect of the 25 acres transferred to her by

her father, relying on Deed No. 2085 to establish her title. The Plaintiff had pleaded in the

alternative that she has acquired prescriptive title to the said land. In terms of the

amended plaint filed on 5th May 1991, the Plaintiff had sought a declaration of title to Lot

R in Plan No. 148 which is the portion of land purchased by the Defendant and for an

order ejecting the Defendant from the said land.

Answer having been filed, the matter proceeded to trial on 24th January 1992. While I

have already referred to the admissions, the issues raised by the parties are set out below.

issues of law. The order on the said issues had been delivered on 15th December 1992,

with the District Court answering the said issues in the affirmative. In essence, the District

Court had held that, (a) the mortgage subsists until the decree is executed; (b) a decree

is an encumbrance for the purposes of the Law; and (c) Section 27B of the Law applies

with retrospective effect.

Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plaintiff had filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal

[CA Case No. 57/1993], By its judgment delivered on 16th July 1993, the Court of Appeal

had held as follows:

This is an application for leave to appeal notwithstanding lapse of time from the

order dated 15.12.92. By that order learned District Judge answered preliminary

legal issues 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in favour of the Defendant. These issues relate to

the vesting of the land in the Land Reform Commission and the operation of the

amendment to the Land Reform Commission Law done by Act No. 39 of 1981. The

trial has to now proceed in the District Court with regard to the issues of fact on the

competing claims based upon prescription. We are of the view that the order of the

16

learned District Judge on the preliminary issues may be canvassed in the final appeal

in the event of a final appeal being filed by the Plaintiff. The application is dismissed

subject to the foregoing reservation.

Further trial Further trial before the District Court proceeded on Issue Nos. 1 10, with an officer from

the Tea Control Department, an officer from the Commission and the Plaintiffs brother

giving evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff while the Defendant gave evidence on her own

behalf. During the trial, each party had raised a further issue on prescription. By its

judgment delivered on 22nd February 2006, the District Court answered Issue Nos. 1-10

against the Plaintiff and dismissed the action. The appeal that was filed by the Plaintiff

against the said judgment of the District Court too had been dismissed by the High Court,

resulting in this appeal.

I must perhaps mention that the sister of the Plaintiff who received 25 acres of land from

Manomani Estate under the same circumstances as the Plaintiff instituted Case No.

10911/L in the District Court of Galle against another person who had purchased land

from the mortgagees following the Fiscals conveyance. That case was decided in favour

of the sister of the Plaintiff. The appeal preferred to the High Court had been dismissed

and this Court had refused leave to appeal against the said judgment of the High Court.

Questions of Law

This Court has granted leave to appeal on thirteen questions of law, with the first twelve

being raised by the Plaintiff, and the thirteenth by the Defendant. The said questions of

law are reproduced below:

(1) The learned Judges of the High Court erred by not taking into consideraon the

decisions of the High Court made in SP/HCCA/GA/09/2001 marked A1 and the

Supreme Court made in SC/HCCA/LA 546/2011 marked A2;

17

(2) The learned Judges of the High Court erred by holding that the Defendant obtained

I must state that the High Court has failed to consider the matters set out in questions of

law Nos. 5 11, thus necessitating this Court to consider such matters in detail.

I shall commence by considering questions of law Nos. 1 and 12.

Issue Nos. 1 and 12

Although a copy of the plaint in Case No. 10911/L filed by the Plaintiffs sister has not

been produced, there is agreement among the parties that the principal legal issue raised

in this appeal is identical to that raised in the aforementioned case. Be that as it may, the

fact that the High Court in HC Case No. SP/HCCA/GA/09/2001(F) upheld the judgment of

the District Court in Case No. 10911/L is irrelevant when one considers the fact that the

said judgment of the High Court is not binding on the High Court that heard the appeal

from the judgment of the District Court in this case.

19

This Court refused to grant leave to appeal from the said judgment by its Order dated 10th

September 2012 made in SC/HC/CALA No. 546/2011. In The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue v. Janashakthi General Insurance [CA (TAX) No. 14/2013; CA Minutes of

20th May 2020] my brother, Justice Janak De Silva responding to an argument that refusal

by the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal is binding in other cases, cited with

approval the finding in B.M. Karunadasa, Assistant Commissioner of Labour vs W.

Balasuriya, Sports of Kings [CA (PHC) APN No. 97/2010; CA minutes of 17th July 2013] that

it is a misconception to come to the conclusion that the refusal of leave by the Supreme

Court constitutes the affirmation of the judgment of the lower court, and held that such

an order cannot be considered as creating a precedent. I am of the view that the refusal

on the part of this Court to grant leave to appeal would only be binding between the same

parties, and therefore is not a consideration that weighs in the mind of this Court today.

In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the learned Judges of the High Court erred

in law when they proceeded to hear the appeal before them [i.e., the appeal that has

given rise to this appeal] on its merits and made an independent determination. Question

of law No.1 is therefore answered in the negative.

With regard to question of law No. 12, it was in evidence that Manomani Estate was a

neglected and abandoned property, that the Plaintiff went into possession of the

impugned 25 acres of Manomani Estate only after Deed No. 2085 was executed in her

favour in 1980, and that she was dispossessed by the Defendant after she purchased the

land in 1984 resulting in action being filed in the District Court in 1985. Thus, the question

of prescription does not arise and the said question of law is answered in the negative.

Title to the land

One of the primary issues that needs to be decided in a rei vindicatio action is whether

the plaintiff has established that he or she has title to the land from which the ejection of

the defendant is sought. If I were to very briefly summarise the contentions of the parties,

then they would be as follows. The position of the Plaintiff was that, (a) the mortgage

executed by her father was wiped out as a result of Manomani Estate being vested in the

Commission free of encumbrances, and (b) she derived her title from the Commission,

20

and therefore free of any encumbrance. The position of the Defendant was four-fold. The

first was that with the decree in the MB action being entered in 1963, the Plaintiffs father

did not have title to the land thereafter. The second was that a decree is not an

encumbrance for the purposes of the Law. The third was that the land is free of

encumbrances only while it remains vested in the Commission. The fourth was that

Section 27B of the Law applies with retrospective effect and therefore the mortgage has

been revived, with the result that the Plaintiff derives her title subject to the mortgage.

The above arguments presented by the learned Presidents Counsel in order to support

their respective position that title to the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint is

with the party they represent, are reflective of the issues that were raised before the

District Court. I shall therefore consider these arguments under six heads in addressing

questions of law Nos. 2 11 and 13.

Does a mortgagor lose title to the land once the decree is entered?

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs father

lost his title to Manomani Estate upon the decree in the MB action being entered in 1963.

If this Court were to agree with the said submission, it would mean that the Plaintiffs

father did not have title to the land at the time the Law was enacted and hence,

Manomani Estate could not be deemed to have vested with the Commission.

There is no dispute that the MB action filed in 1956 by the mortgagees was only a

hypothecary action in which title to Manomani Estate was not in issue. A hypothecary

action has been defined in Section 2 of the Mortgage Act to mean, an action to obtain

an order declaring the mortgaged property to be bound and executable for the payment

of the money due upon the mortgage and to enforce such payment by a judicial sale of

the mortgaged property;.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff that the decree

entered in the MB action on 18th December 1963 was only for the payment of money due

upon the mortgage, and that, while no title passed to the judgment creditor upon such

decree being entered, it is only when the property is sold in a public auction that the

21

purchaser acquires title to the land purchased and the mortgagor simultaneously loses

title to the same.

This position is reflected in Section 289 of the Civil Procedure Code, in terms of which,

The right and title of the judgment- debtor or of any person holding under him or deriving

title through him to immovable property sold by virtue of an execution is not divested by

the sale until the confirmation of the sale by the Court and the execution of the Fiscal's

conveyance. But if the sale is confirmed by the Court and the conveyance is executed in

pursuance of the sale, the grantee in the conveyance is deemed to have been vested with

the legal estate from the time of the sale. This provision is made applicable to mortgaged

land directed to be sold in execution of a decree by Section 61(1)(a) of the Mortgage Act.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff buttressed his argument by stating

further that an argument to the contrary, namely that title passes upon the decree being

entered, is not tenable for the reason that the mortgagee may not be the person who

purchases the property at the public auction.

A similar question arose for consideration in M S Perera (Assistant Government Agent,

Kandy) v Unantenna and Others [54 NLR 457] where Chief Justice Alan Rose while

observing [at pages 459 and 460], that R W Lee in An Introduction to Roman Dutch Law

[(1953) 5th ed. Oxford University Press] makes no mention of a transformation or change

of nature on the part of a mortgage after decree, stated as follows:

Wille in Principles of South African Law (1937 edition, page 192) does not support

the contention that a decree entered in a mortgage action has the effect of

extinguishing the mortgage. According to him a sale in execution must follow the

decree in order that the mortgage may be extinguished. In dealing with the law as

to how by a decree of court a mortgage may be extinguished the learned author does

not even suggest that the bare entering up of a decree in an action to enforce the

mortgage has the effect of terminating it.

Accordingly, the Plaintiffs father was free to dispose of Manomani Estate subject to the mortgage and the decree until such time as the decree was executed, at which point the

22

purchaser at the public auction acquired title to the land upon the Fiscals conveyance. I am therefore in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff, and take the view that the entering of the decree in 1963 in the MB action did not take away the title that the Plaintiffs father had to Manomani Estate. Thus, when the Law came into force, title to Manomani Estate remained with the Plaintiffs father, subject to the mortgage and the decree. Is a decree entered in a hypothecary action an encumbrance for the purposes of the Law? Even though the issue whether a decree entered in a mortgage action is an encumbrance for the purposes of the Law was raised by the Defendant as Issue No. 11 and has been answered by the District Court in favour of the Plaintiff, the said issue has not been addressed by the High Court. I have already referred to Section 3(2) of the Law in terms of which all agricultural land in excess of the ceiling was deemed to vest in the Commission. The effect of such vesting is reflected in Section 6 which provides that, Where any agricultural land is vested in the Commission under this Law, such vesting shall have the effect of giving the Commission absolute title to such land as from the date of such vesting, and free from all encumbrances. [emphasis added] What existed at the time the Law came into force was the mortgage, and the decree in the MB action filed to enforce the mortgage, but with an appeal made in respect of the judgment from which the decree arose. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that, (a) on the date that the Law came into operation [26th August 1972], the legal owner of Manomani Estate was the Plaintiffs father, although encumbered by the mortgage which was the subject matter of the hypothecary action, (b) the Plaintiffs father was therefore required by the Law to declare his ownership in Manomani Estate, and (c) in view of Section 6, Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of all encumbrances, including the mortgage and the decree entered in the MB action. It was therefore his position that although decree had been entered, given the fact that the MB action was only a hypothecary action, the mortgage was very much alive at the time the Law came into force, and that the mortgage and the decree are encumbrances for the purposes of Section 6.

23

The view that the mortgage as well as the decree are encumbrances over the land is supported by the meaning attached to "incumbrance" in Misso v Hadjear [19 NLR 277 at page 278] where De Sampayo, J stated that, In the largest sense it means any kind of burden on or diminution of the title, and in a narrower sense it is generally employed to indicate a mortgage or charge upon the property. In Sarvanamuttu v Solamuttu [26 NLR 385; at page 389] Bertram, CJ stated that a mortgage decree does affect the land in the sense of it investing a person with an interest in the land or imposing or creating some charge, interest, or liability which would operate prejudicially to the title of any subsequent purchaser. I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff that as the MB action was only a hypothecary action, the mortgage retained its character without any transformation, even though decree had been entered, and that as at the date of the Law coming into force, the mortgage was very much in existence, although subject to the decree. I am therefore of the view that the aforementioned mortgage and decree are encumbrances on Manomani Estate and were subject to the provisions of the Law. Does Section 6 of the Law apply only while land is deemed vested in the Commission? Referring to Section 6, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the title to Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of encumbrances and that Section 6 had the effect of completely wiping out the mortgage and the decree. He therefore submitted that with the mortgage and decree having been wiped out, Manomani Estate could not have been sold at a public auction in satisfaction of a decree which no longer had any legal validity and therefore no title could have passed to the person who bought Manomani Estate at the auction [in this case the mortgagees] and consequently no title passed to the Defendant. I agree that with the application of Section 6, title to Manomani Estate vested in the Commission free of the mortgage suit and the decree, but subject to the caveat that it would continue to be so only so far as the land remained vested in the Commission or where the Commission alienated the land to a third party in terms of the Law. In other words, if Manomani Estate which was deemed vested in the Commission was to revert

24

back to the owner, either in its entirety or in part, such as for example upon the making of the statutory determination in terms of Section 19 or an Order in terms of Section 14(2), it would revert back to the owner with the mortgage and the decree that Manomani Estate was encumbered with on the day the Law came into operation. Thus, in such circumstances there is no wiping out of the mortgage. What takes place is that in terms of Section 6, Manomani Estate was deemed vested in the Commission free of all encumbrances and would continue to be so, with the encumbrance floating over Manomani Estate, only for it to be attached to the land once again in the event of Manomani Estate or part thereof being returned to the Plaintiffs father. This is clearly further borne out by the provisions of Section 27B introduced by the Land Reform (Special Provisions) Act, No. 39 of 1981, to which I will advert to later in this judgment. Did the Plaintiff derive the title of her father or that of the Commission? The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that with the coming into operation of the Law and with land over and above the ceiling deemed to have been vested in the Commission free of any encumbrance, the Plaintiffs father lost his title to the mortgaged property and was transformed into a statutory lessee. He therefore submitted that when the Plaintiffs father executed Deed No. 2085, he did so not as the owner of Manomani Estate which was subject to a mortgage but as the statutory lessee of a land that was no longer encumbered. He submitted further that with Manomani Estate being deemed vested in the Commission in 1972, the Plaintiff derived her title to 25 acres of Manomani Estate not from her father but from the Commission, and most importantly, free of any encumbrance. I am unable to agree with this argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff. Although in terms of Section 3(2), all agricultural lands in excess of the ceiling are deemed to have vested in the Commission on the day the Law came into operation by way of a legal fiction, as I have already stated, for the purposes of this case, that vesting is subject to: (a) a statutory determination of the land area amounting to 50 acres that an owner

would be allowed to retain as his entitlement in terms of the Law; and

25

(b) the release to the owner of land in excess of the ceiling in order that the said land

be gifted to his children who are over the age of eighteen. What the Commission did in terms of the Order made under Section 14(2) was grant approval to the owner to transfer land to his children, which is a further manifestation of the concept of the land being merely deemed vested in the Commission. In doing so, the Commission revived the title of the owner to that portion of land for which approval was being granted, while simultaneously removing his status as statutory lessee, thereby enabling the land be transferred to his children. This is reflected in the wording of Section 14(3), as well as by the fact that the Deed of Gift was executed by the Plaintiffs father and not by the Commission. Thus, I am of the view that the Plaintiff in this case derived her title from her father and not from the Commission. Having said so, I must reiterate that the benefit of title vesting free of any encumbrances, as provided by Section 6, has only been conferred upon the Commission, and that when the Commission grants approval in terms of Section 14(2) for an inter-family transfer, the title that the beneficiaries of such transfer receive is not the unencumbered title of the Commission but the title of the person who owned the land at the time the Law came into force, including any encumbrance that may have existed at the time in respect of such land. Indeed, this is the process of re-attachment of an encumbrance that I have discussed earlier. In other words, the Plaintiff derived her title to 25 acres of Manomani Estate from her father subject to the mortgage executed by her father and the decree in the MB action. To hold otherwise would mean that an encumbered title can be cleared of such encumbrances via the Law for the benefit of its owner, who could thereby evade his or her obligations and liabilities under a mortgage or any other encumbrance. This certainly would not have been the intention of the legislature when the Law was enacted, in spite of the apparent consensus that landowners losing vast tracts of land overnight be given certain concessions such as inter-family transfers of land over the stipulated ceiling. The above position is confirmed by: (a) the latter part of Section 12 of the Law, to which I shall advert; and

26

(b) Section 21(c) of the Law, in terms of which, Every statutory determination published

in the Gazette under Section 19 shall inter alia specify any servitude or encumbrance attaching to such agricultural land. [emphasis added], which means that when the Commission makes a statutory determination, any encumbrance that existed over such land referred to in the statutory determination at the time the said land vested in the Commission, continues to hang over the owner. Section 12(1) The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff, whilst conceding that an injustice would be caused to mortgagees from the blanket suppression of all encumbrances on land vested in the Commission through the operation of Section 6, submitted that a mortgagee has been provided a solution by way of Section 12(1) of the Law and that the mortgagees ought to have pursued relief under this section. Section 12(1) reads as follows:

Where any agricultural land subject to a mortgage, vests in the Commission under the provisions of this Law the mortgagee, shall have a lien to the extent of his interest in such agricultural land on the compensation payable to the owner thereof and where such compensation is not sufficient to meet his claim, such mortgagee, shall be entitled to enforce his rights against any land subject to such mortgage, in the hands of the owner of the agricultural land vested in the Commission after the ceiling of agricultural land is applied to him. It is clear that in terms of Section 12(1), a mortgagee has a claim on the compensation that is payable to the mortgagor. However, this was not in issue before the District Court and therefore there is no evidence before this Court indicating whether compensation was in fact paid to the Plaintiffs father for the balance part of Manomani Estate that vested with the Commission. Although the said Section further provides that where such amount of compensation is not sufficient to meet the mortgagees claim, the mortgagee can enforce his or her rights over the 50 acres of land that is released to the owner from the mortgaged land, this will not apply in the present case as no part of Manomani Estate remained with the Plaintiffs father.

27

I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff that the mortgagees could have made a claim on the compensation paid to the Plaintiffs father but differ in holding that they were not obliged to do so, especially in view of the subsequent Order made in terms of Section 14(2) which had the effect of restoring the mortgage and the decree, and thereby the rights of the mortgagees over Manomani Estate. Did Section 27B(1) apply with retrospective effect? The necessity to consider the application of Section 27B, introduced by Section 8 of Act No. 39 of 1981, and forming the basis of the question of law raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant, does not arise in view of the above conclusion that the title of the Plaintiff is subject to the mortgage and the decree. I shall nonetheless refer to the arguments of the parties not only for the sake of completeness but also because it reflects the intention of the legislature with regard to encumbrances where an Order is made under Section 14. Section 27B(1) reads as follows:

Where any agricultural land is transferred to any person in consequence of an order under section 14 or is alienated, or vested in, any person under paragraph (f) of section 22 or where any person is allowed to retain any agricultural land in consequence of a determination made under section 19, such order, alienation, vesting or determination, as the case may be, shall have the effect of reviving, with effect from the date of such order, alienation, vesting or determination, as the case may be, any encumbrance which subsisted over that land on the day immediately preceding the date on which that land was vested in the Commission. [emphasis added] Section 27B(1) thus makes it clear that all encumbrances that existed on the day immediately preceding the day the Law came into operation, shall be revived in respect of lands to which an Order under Section 14 would apply, with effect from the date of such Order. Section 27B(1) supports my previous finding that any agricultural land over which there exists an encumbrance continues to be so encumbered when returned to the

28

hands of the owner to be retained or transferred to a child or parent, and is free of the encumbrance only when such land is in the hands of the Commission or is alienated by the Commission to a third party in terms of the Law. It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant that in terms of Section 27B(1) the mortgage that was executed over Manomani Estate on 1st February 1948 by Mortgage Bond No. 3514, and which mortgage stood suppressed while the land was deemed vested in the Commission, was revived when the Commission made its Order under Section 14(2) on 10th June 1974, with effect from such date. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff however submitted that Section 27B(1) applies only in respect of an order made after Act No. 39 of 1981 was enacted into law and that Section 27B(1) does not apply with retrospective effect. He accordingly submitted that as the Order under Section 14(2) was made in June 1974 and Deed No. 2085, by which the Plaintiff derived her title, was executed in 1980, prior to Act No. 39 of 1981, the provisions of Section 27B has no application in this case. I am attracted by the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff for two reasons. The first is that Act No. 39 of 1981 introduced detailed provisions that permitted land owners to make applications seeking approval to effect further inter-family transfers, in spite of the 3 month time limit imposed by the principal enactment for such applications. The second is that while Section 27B has been introduced by Section 8 of Act No. 39 of 1981, Section 16 of that Act only provides that, The amendments made to the principal enactment by section 2 (a), 12 and 15 of this Act shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into operation on the date of commencement of the principal enactment. I am however mindful that in Jinawathie [supra; at page 139] it was held that, an encumbrance which subsisted over and in respect of the plaintiff-respondent's undivided shares in the larger land would, from and after the date on which P6 came into operation, be revived and attach to the land described in P6. P6 is the statutory determinaon in Jinawathie and was dated 25th September 1974, and so it seems that the ve Judge Bench of this Court in Jinawathie has considered, despite not explicitly spelling it out, that Secon 27B does have retrospecve operaon. However,

29

this is not a maer that I wish to pronounce on today, as, for the purposes of the present case, I have already arrived at the conclusion that, independent of Secon 27B, the Plain derived her tle from her father subject to the encumbrances aaching thereto. Conclusion Thus, the mortgage over Manomani Estate, effected in 1948, which was sought to be enforced through the MB action from 1956, which continued following the entering of the decree in 1963 until the introduction of the Law in 1972, and which stood suppressed while Manomani Estate was vested in the Commission, completed its full circle when the Order under Section 14(2) was made in 1974 in favour of the Plaintiffs father, thereby reviving the mortgage and the decree. I am of the view that the title the Plaintiff acquired in terms of Deed No. 2085 was that of her fathers and was therefore subject to the mortgage and the decree. With this Court having dismissed the appeal against the MB action in July 1974, and part of the land having been returned to the Plaintiffs father to be transferred to the Plaintiff and her sister, the mortgagees had every right to enforce the decree in respect of that part of the land, which was duly done in November 1983. Upon such execution of the decree, the Plaintiff lost her title to the 25 acres of land in Manomani Estate referred to in Deed No. 2085 and the Defendant simultaneously acquired title to a part of Manomani Estate, through Deed No. 1341. I am therefore of the view that the Plaintiff had no title to the land referred to in the plaint when she instituted District Court Case No. 10650/L, while the Defendant had title to such land by virtue of Deed No. 1341. The Plaintiff is therefore not entitled to the relief prayed for in the plaint. The questions of law are answered as follows: (1) No. (2) Even though the finding of the High Court that the Defendant acquired title prior to

the Plaintiff is erroneous, the said finding has no bearing on the principal issues in this case.

30

(3) No. (4) Even though the High Court has failed to consider this issue, the finding of the

District Court on this question of law was in favour of the Plaintiff and regardless, such finding has no bearing on the principal issues to be decided. (5) (11) Even though the High Court has failed to examine the provisions of the Law, it

has no bearing on the final outcome of this case for the reasons set out in this judgment. (12) No. (13) Yes. The judgment of the District Court and the High Court are affirmed. This appeal is dismissed, without costs.
