Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner was issued the Annual Permit (P8) under the State Lands

Ordinance by the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary of Uvaparanagama

on 12.02.2013. The endorsements on this Permit show that the validity

period of it has been extended on yearly basis for the years 2014, 2015

and 2016 ending on 31st of December each year. The Permit is for a portion

of Lot 4 in extent of 10 perches in Final Village Plan No. 196 made by the

Surveyor-General marked P1(a). The Petitioner has shaded on P1(a) the

area he occupies, which is located immediately adjacent to the Doolgolle

Oya. This is also made clear by Plan marked P11, another recent Plan

prepared by the Surveyor-General. It may be observed that although the

Annual Permit is for 10 perches, according to P11, the Petitioner is in

occupation of a land in extent of 20 perches. The Petitioner has

constructed a building on the Permit land and has been carrying on a

business by the name of Riverside Restaurant. A liquor licence has also

been obtained to the premises.

3

SC/FR/38/2018

In 2016, he requested from the Divisional Secretary a long-term lease for

this land instead of a yearly Permit. The Divisional Secretary has not flatly

refused this request. As a prerequisite to the issuance of a long-term lease,

the Divisional Secretary has taken steps to have a survey done through

the Surveyor-General to ascertain whether the land falls within

reservations of Doolgolle Oya and Road (vide R2). By R3 the Surveyor-

General has informed the Divisional Secretary that, according to the List

of the Lands (which appears to be a reference to the Tenement List), Lot 4

has been reserved for Doolgolle Oya and therefore new survey is

unnecessary. It may be recalled that the Petitioners Permit is in respect

of part of Lot 4 in the Final Village Plan 196. The Tenement List marked

P1(b) attached to the Final Village Plan 196 inter alia states that Lot 4 is

Reservation for Doolgolle Oya. According to P1(b), this remark has been

made as far back as 1928, when the Plan was originally prepared. Hence

the Divisional Secretary has informed the Petitioner by P13 dated

07.12.2017 that the Annual Permit cannot be renewed. He has further

informed the Petitioner that steps have also been taken under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to recover possession of the adjoining

lands. The Notice to Quit dated 12.01.2018 marked P15 has been issued

to the Petitioner under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Without defending the action in the Magistrates Court in terms of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act if a case is filed against him or

without invoking the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal against the

decisions of the Divisional Secretary as the law provides, the Petitioner

filed this application on 24.01.2018 seeking declarations that his

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of

the Constitution have been violated by the 1st to 5th Respondents (whereas

there are only three Respondents the Divisional Secretary, the Land

Commissioner General and the Attorney-General), and that the Quit

Notice P15 is null and void. He also sought six interim reliefs primarily

4

SC/FR/38/2018

preventing the Divisional Secretary from taking action to evict the

Petitioner as initiated by the Quit Notice.

This Court has granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution and an interim relief preventing the Respondents from

making an application to the Magistrates Court for an order of ejectment

pending determination of this application.

Let me now consider the arguments presented on behalf of the Petitioner.

The first argument of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner is

that, in view of condition 5 of the Permit, the Permit is personal to the

Petitioner. Therefore, in terms of section 16 of the State Lands Ordinance,

all rights under such Permit or licence shall be finally determined by the

death of such grantee. According to the learned Presidents Counsel, this

means that the Petitioner is entitled to enjoy the land until his death, or

in other words, the Permit is valid for life. Hence, he argues that, before

the Divisional Secretary decides not to renew the Permit, the procedure

laid down for cancellation of a Permit (section 17 of the State Lands

Ordinance and sections 106-128 of the Land Development Ordinance)

shall be followed. This argument is clearly misconceived in law.

The meaning of condition 5 of the Permit that the Permit is personal to the

Permit holder can be understood by reading condition 6 which states that

the Permit holder shall not sublet, mortgage or alienate his rights in the

land during the time the Permit is in force.

This can also be understood by comparing section 11 with section 16.

Section 11 of the State Lands Ordinance states Where the rights under

any instrument of disposition are not personal to the grantee but may be

assigned by act inter vivos or may pass on his death to his heirs or devisees,

the burden of any covenants or conditions inserted in such instrument shall

5

SC/FR/38/2018

run with the land and shall be binding upon the grantee and upon all

persons claiming that land through, from or under the grantee.

What section 16 states is:

(1) Where it is provided in any Permit or licence that such Permit or

licence is personal to the grantee thereof, all rights under such Permit

or licence shall be finally determined by the death of such grantee.

(2) Where it is provided in any Permit or licence that such Permit or

licence shall be personal to the grantee thereof, the land in respect of

which such Permit or licence was issued and all improvements

effected thereon shall, on the death of the grantee, be the property of

the Crown; and no person claiming through, from or under the grantee

shall have any interest in such land or be entitled to any

compensation for any such improvements.

The procedure laid down in section 17 of the State Lands Ordinance and

sections 106-128 of the Land Development Ordinance shall be followed in

the cancellation of a Permit during its validity period. After the yearly

Permit lapses due to effluxion of time, the question of cancellation does

not arise. Hence those sections have no relevance in this context. The

condition 1 of the Permit is very clear: unless renewed for one year at the

discretion of the Divisional Secretary, the Permit shall lapse at the end of

one year period.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that As a

result of the statutory protection afforded by the aforesaid Ordinance to the

Petitioner [section 17 of the State Lands Ordinance and sections 106-128 of

the Land Development Ordinance], the Petitioner made improvements which

amounting to 15 million rupees in the said land while carrying out business

for 17 years. Every year, the Petitioner renewed his Permit and excise

license after complying the conditions and making due payments. Therefore,

6

SC/FR/38/2018

the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation that his Permit would be renewed

as he has not violated any conditions for the past 17 years while doing

business. is unacceptable. As I explained earlier, there is no such

statutory protection afforded to the Petitioner.

The condition 11 of the Permit expressly and unambiguously states that

no compensation is payable for any improvements on the land and no

damages are payable for any loss caused. Even in the case of cancellation

of the Permit, section 18 of the State Lands Ordinance states that neither

the grantee nor any other person shall be entitled to any compensation or

damages whatsoever by reason of the cancellation of a Permit or licence

under section 17, and no claim for compensation or damages shall in any

such case be entertained by any Court.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the decision of the 1st

Respondent Divisional Secretary not to renew the Annual Permit when he

was satisfied that the land is part of Doolgolle Oya reservation is not illegal.

If he had done the opposite, it would have been an illegality. No legitimate

expectation can be founded on or arise from illegality. The representation

made by the public authority shall be intra vires as opposed to ultra vires

to form a legitimate expectation enforceable in law. The principle of legality

is a fundamental ingredient of the rule of law.

Wade in Administrative Law (11th Edition) page 454-455 state:

An expectation whose fulfilment requires that a decision-maker

should make an unlawful decision, cannot be a legitimate

expectation. It is inherent in many of the decisions, and express in

several, that the expectation must be within the power of the decision-

maker before any question of protection arises. There are good

reasons why this should be so: an official cannot be allowed in effect

7

SC/FR/38/2018

to rewrite Acts of Parliament by making promises of unlawful conduct

or adopting an unlawful practice.

People expect that the public authorities act within the scope of their

powers in accordance with the law; if they fail to do so and people who

place their trust in ultra vires representations act upon them, innocent

representees are not without a remedy. Wade states at page 455 that such

representees can seek compensation. This he states not upholding an

ultra vires representation but simply recognising that the undoubted fact of

the representation may be an element in establishing that the compensation

should be paid. However, Wade stresses: The protection of the trust placed

in an expectation is important; but it is not as important as upholding the

rule of law.

De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition) pages 702-703 states:

In R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Ex p. Hamble

(Offshore) Fisheries Ltd [1995] 2 All ER 714 at 731, Sedley J. said

that to bind public bodies to an unlawful representation would have

the dual effect of unlawfully extending their statutory power and

destroying the ultra vires doctrine by permitting the public bodies

arbitrarily to extend their powers. On the other hand, to bind bodies

to a promise to act outside the powers would in effect endorse an

unlawful act. It must, on this view, be doubtful whether the

expectation that a body will exceed its powers can be legitimate.

In C.W. Mackie & Co. Ltd. v. Hugh Moragoda, Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue and Others [1986] 1 Sri LR 300 at 309, Sharvananda C.J.

stated:

[T]he equal treatment guaranteed by Article 12 is equal treatment in

the performance of a lawful act. Via Article 12, one cannot seek the

execution of any illegal or invalid act. Fundamental to this postulate

8

SC/FR/38/2018

of equal treatment is that it should be referable to the exercise of a

valid right, founded in law in contradistinction to an illegal right which

is invalid in law. In the exercise of its powers under Article 126(4)

of the Constitution this court can issue a direction to a public authority

or official commanding him to do his duty in accordance with the law.

It cannot issue a direction to act contrary to the provisions of the law

or to do something which in law, would be in excess of his powers.

In the case of Nimalsiri v. Colonel P.P.J. Fernando and Others

(SC/FR/256/2010, SC Minutes of 17.09.2015) Jayawardena J. held:

An expectation the fulfilment of which results in the decision maker

making an unlawful decision cannot be treated as a legitimate

expectation. Therefore, the expectation must be within the powers of

the decision-maker for it to be treated as a legitimate expectation

case.

In the original petition, the Petitioner did not take up the position that the

land in dispute is not part of reservation of Doolgolle Oya. The Petitioner

was challenging the decision not to extend the yearly Permit for other

reasons, the main of which was political victimization because his family

had been involved in politics. This was not pursued at the argument. At

the argument, one of the main contentions was that the land had not been

identified as a reservation. As I stated earlier, relying on the Plans of the

Surveyor-General, the Divisional Secretary has come to the finding that

the land in dispute is within the Doolgolle Oya reservation. The Petitioner

has not countered that position by tendering a different Plan. The

Petitioner in his counter affidavit drawing attention of the Court to section

50 of the State Lands Ordinance which deals with reservations states that

no regulations have been made prescribing the limits of reservation for

public streams except for the Western Province.

9

SC/FR/38/2018

Section 50 of the State Lands Ordinance states:

Subject as hereinafter provided and without prejudice to the powers

conferred by section 49, any Crown land which is immediately

adjacent to a public stream and lies within a prescribed distance

therefrom measured in such manner as may be prescribed shall, for

the purposes of this Ordinance, be deemed to be a Crown reservation

constituted by Notification under section 49; and all the provisions of

this Part shall apply accordingly to any such reservation:

At the argument, learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents

drew the attention of Court as well as learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner to the Gazette dated 15.10.1948 and paragraph 228 of the Land

Manual that had been tendered to Court with the motion dated

29.10.2021, which addresses this issue.

By the Ceylon Government Gazette No. 9,912 dated 15.10.1948, Crown

Lands Regulations have been published. In reference to section 50 of the

State Lands Ordinance on the subject of Crown reservations for public

streams, it states:

11. (1) The distance to be prescribed for the purpose of section 50 of

the Ordinance-

(a) in the case of any Crown land which is referred to in that section

and is not marked, described or indicated as a stream reservation in

any plan prepared by or under the authority of the Surveyor-General

shall-

(i) where the width of the public stream does not extend fifteen

feet, be one chain,

(ii) where the width of such stream exceeds fifteen feet but does

not exceed fifty feet, be two chains,

10

SC/FR/38/2018

(iii) where the width of such stream exceeds fifty feet, be three

chains

In terms of section 81 of the Evidence Ordinance, the Court shall presume

the genuineness of Gazettes. In terms of section 83 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys

purporting to be signed by the Surveyor-General or officer acting on his

behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate.

In terms of section 49 of the State Lands Ordinance, the Minister in charge

of the subject can by Notification published in the Gazette declare that

any State land is considered a State reservation inter alia for the protection

of the source, course or bed of any public stream, springs, tanks,

reservoirs, lakes, ponds, lagoons, creeks, canals, aqueducts, elas,

channels (whether natural or artificial), paddy fields and land suitable for

paddy cultivation.

The submission of learned Deputy Solicitor General that, when the

Surveyor-General has not specifically demarcated an area next to a public

stream as a reservation, the deeming provision in section 50 of the State

Lands Ordinance would apply to bring such areas within a reservation, is

acceptable.

In any event, the Petitioner in this case does not seek a direction to the

Divisional Secretary to issue a yearly Permit or a long-term lease to this

land. He seeks a declaration that the Notice to Quit issued under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is a nullity. The Notice to Quit has been

issued on the basis that the Petitioner is in unlawful occupation of a State

land, not that the Petitioner is in unlawful occupation of a reservation for

a public stream.

The Petitioner in his counter affidavit says The 1st Respondent has not

taken any steps to remove existing illegal constructions in Uwaparanagama

11

SC/FR/38/2018

which built along the river bed obstructing the water flow of Doolgolla Oya.

Such illegal constructions show that the 1st Respondent has no genuine

interest to remove the illegal constructions other than to politically victimize

me and damage my family business and reputation. But he has not stated

whether what is stated in paragraph two of P13 where the 1st Respondent

states that eviction orders have already been obtained from Court against

people who have made unauthorized constructions in the vicinity of the

Petitioners business premises is false. The Petitioner has tendered a

number of photographs to show the danger to the riverbed by those

constructions. But he had been careful not to attach a photograph of his

business establishment for the Court to get an idea about the real location

of his business establishment. In any event, two wrongs do not make a

right, and on proof of the commission of one wrong the equal protection of

the law cannot be invoked to obtain relief in the form of an order

compelling commission of a second wrong (Gamaethige v. Siriwardena

[1988] 1 Sri LR 384 at 404). Article 12 of the Constitution cannot be

understood as requiring the authorities to act illegally in one case because

they have acted illegally in other cases (Jayasekera v. Vipulasena [1988] 2

Sri LR 237). Article 12 of the Constitution guarantees equal protection of

the law and not equal violation of the law. For a complaint of unequal

treatment to succeed, the Petitioner must demonstrate unequal treatment

in the performance of a lawful act (Seelavansa Thero v. Tennakoon,

Additional Secretary, Public Service Commission [2004] 2 Sri LR 241 at

248).

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the decision of the 1st

Respondent Divisional Secretary not to renew the Annual Permit for

another year is not illegal.

12

SC/FR/38/2018

I hold that there is no violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution and

there is no reason to declare that the Quit Notice P15 is a nullity. I dismiss

the application of the Petitioner with costs.

As agreed at the argument, this decision would be binding on the

connected case SCFR/14/2018.
