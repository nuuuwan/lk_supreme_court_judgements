Judgement

Aluwihare, PC, J,

This is a Fundamental Rights Application concerning the alleged non-promotion of an

employee attached to the Land Reform Commission. In the Petition of the Petitioner has

alleged that her Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution had been violated by the 1st to 10th Respondents or any one or more of them.

The Petitioner asserts that the 1st to 10th Respondents had consistently denied her a promotion

by failing to appoint her to the post of Deputy Director - Legal of the Land Reform

Commission (hereinafter referred to as the LRC), and they had, by this omission violated her

fundamental rights. This Court granted leave to proceed on the alleged infringement under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Only the 1A, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 17th Respondents

have made representations before this Court, and they will hereinafter be referred to as the

Respondents.

I wish to succinctly state the facts of this case before delving into the relevant legal

considerations.

7

The Facts

The Petitioner is an Attorney-at-Law who holds a Bachelor of Laws Degree. She was initially

employed as a Legal Assistant Grade V on a contractual basis at the LRC from 23rd July

2007, subject to a six-month probation period (vide P3, the letter of appointment dated

16.11.2017). The Petitioners service contract was renewed for further year on 24.01.2008

till 23.01.2009. The Petitioner was also confirmed in employment with effect from

01.02.2008 by letter dated 29.01.2008.

The Petitioner claims to have been promised recruitment as a Legal Officer Grade III in

accordance with the Scheme of Recruitment of 1979, prior to her recruitment as a Legal

Assistant Grade V. The Petitioner also claims to have been continuously harassed at the LRC

while not receiving due promotions. The Respondents made no specific averments in this

regard besides noting that the Petitioner was not promoted to due to her poor performance

(vide Written Submission of the Respondents dated 16th December 2022).

Pursuant to repeated appeals and letters of complaint to the 1st Respondents predecessor as

the Chairman of the LRC (P7, P7(b), P7(c)) as well as a complaint to the Labour

Commissioner (Colombo General), the Petitioner had been promoted to the managerial level

as the Assistant Director Grade II of the LRC with effect from 03.10.2012 by letter dated

29.01.2014 (P9).

Per the minutes of the LRC dated 26.02.2019, 10 Assistant Directors (11th to 20th

Respondents) who were appointed alongside the Petitioner on 03.10.2012, had been

promoted as Deputy Directors of the LRC.

Submissions

The Petitioner alleges that her omission from the promotion to the post of Deputy Director

is particularly concerning as the Petitioner is an Attorney-at-law with 18 years of experience

and she possesses educational qualifications above and beyond any qualifications possessed

by those who were promoted.

Furthermore, the Petitioner noted that the operational scheme of recruitment of the LRC dated

03.10.2012, in Section 6.1.2 sets out that for promotion to the position of Deputy Director

of the LRC requires 6 years of continuous service in Grade II and all due annual salary

increments. The Petitioner claims to have fulfilled the elements so required.

The Respondents are in agreement with the Petitioner as to the applicability of the scheme of

8

recruitment of the LRC dated 03.10.2012 (P10). However, they argue that the Petitioner

was not eligible for the said promotion as she had not completed the necessary requirements

per the scheme.

Section 6.1.2 of the Scheme of Recruitment is reproduced below for convenience.

Of the aforementioned requirements of the scheme, the Respondents claim that the Petitioner

has failed to fulfil requirements no. ii) and vi). Specifically, they argue that the Petitioner has

not received her salary increments per requirement no. ii) and that she is not proficient,

neither has she adduced proof of proficiency of a 2nd National Language per requirement no.

vi). The Respondents also added that the Petitioner has failed to indicate that she has

performed exceptionally well ( ) in service during the immediate

6 years prior to the year of application for promotion as per requirement no. iii).

The Petitioner makes no averment regarding requirements iii) and vi) besides noting that she

is an Attorney-at-Law and that she has, in the course of her work, executed a considerable

number of Deeds and instruments. Regarding requirement no. ii), the Petitioner has

9

produced a letter from the Secretary, Director (Administration) of the LRC (Z) and dated

08.12.2022 (subsequent to the filing of the Petition) which affirms that she has, in fact, in

received all her due salary increments. The letter also states that it is issued at the Petitioners

request.

Were the Petitioners Fundamental Rights violated?

It appears to me that the Court has been placed in a peculiar setting for the adjudication of

this matter. On the one hand, the Petitioner argues that she has been consistently and

deliberately denied promotion within the LRC, which she argues violated her Fundamental

Right to equal protection of the Law and equality before the Law under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. On the other hand, the LRC argues that the Petitioner was denied the promotion

of concern due to her consistent failure to perform at the required standards in the execution

of her duties, as well as her failure to fulfil the requirements which would make her eligible

for the promotion.

The issue of ineligibility can be dealt with directly by the application of the scheme of

recruitment (P10). The Respondents submitted that the Petitioner has not received her salary

increments per requirement no. ii) and that she is not proficient, neither has she adduced

proof of proficiency of a 2nd National Language per requirement no. vi), and that the

Petitioner has failed to indicate that she has performed exceptionally well (

) in service during the immediate 6 years prior to the year of application for

promotion as per requirement no. iii) of Clause 6.1.2 of the Scheme. The Petitioners response

was that she is an Attorney-at-Law who has, in the course of her work, executed many Deeds

and instruments. The Petitioner also produced a letter from the Secretary, Director

(Administration) of the LRC (Z) and dated 08.12.2022 which affirms that she received all

her due salary increments.

Notably, the Petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence (such as certificate to her character

or performance) to controvert the Respondents claim that she has performed her duties

exceptionally well. The petitioner also failed to produce any material which indicates that

she is proficient in a 2nd National Language.

I do not think it necessary to engage in an etymological pursuit to understand what is meant

by the words exceptionally well in Clause 6.1.2 iii) of the scheme of recruitment (P10).

Such a project would only delay the inevitable conclusion that per the scheme of recruitment,

in order to be considered eligible for promotion to the post of Deputy Director, the applicant

10

must have performed exceptionally well in the execution of their duties. It logically follows

that such an exceptional performance may be evidenced by a certificate or reference from a

superior affirming such notion.

I wish to further state that most schemes of promotion and recruitment for officers require a

degree of merit in the performance of duties. In most cases, considerable weightage is given

to this requirement as it is perhaps the most potent evidence of the history of a persons

performance.

I find it prudent at this stage to make reference to the sage words of Justice Fernando in Perera

v. Cyril Ranatunga, Secretary Defence and others [1993] 1 SLR 39 (at page 43).

The plain meaning of "merit" is the quality of deserving well, excellence, or worth; it is

derived from the Latin "mereri", meaning to earn, or to deserve. In my opinion, 'merit" must

be considered in relation to the individual officer, as well as the requirements of the post to

which he seeks promotion. In relation to the individual officer, there is a negative and a

positive aspect: whether there is demerit, e.g. incompetence and poor performance in his

present post, and whether there is "positive" merit, such as a high degree of competence and

excellent performance. It would also be legitimate to consider the suitability of the officer for

the post, having regard to the aptitudes and skills required for the efficient discharge of the

functions of that post, and the service to be rendered.

It is evident that in the present case, having considered the application of the Petitioner, the

Respondents were of the opinion that the Petitioner did not merit a promotion due to her

poor performance. Not only is that [performance] a consideration an employer is generally

entitled to consider in the context of advancement of their employees, in the present case, the

Respondents were required to consider the Petitioners performance per the scheme of

recruitment. Therefore, it appears to me that the Respondents had not acted arbitrarily,

unreasonably, or unlawfully by denying the Petitioner the promotion to the post of Deputy

Director. The Respondents had relied on the applicable scheme of promotion and the

assessment of the Petitioners superiors to determine that she was not eligible for promotion.

Even after the filing of this application and being confronted with the submission of the

Respondents regarding her failure to fulfil the aforesaid requirements, the Petitioner did not

produce any material to her benefit in that regard. This court cannot brush aside lightly the

assertions made by the Respondents which indicates that the Petitioner had had a history of

underperforming.

11

In my view, the material before this court falls short of the required threshold of proof to

conclude that the Respondents had violated the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1). The position in our jurisprudence regarding the violation of a persons

fundamental right to equal protection of the law and equality before the law has evolved

through the decades. Presently, the success of an application alleging a violation of Article

12(1) rests on the ability of a Petitioner to establish any unlawfulness, arbitrary

action/inaction, unreasonable conduct or manifest unfairness (vide Rajavarothiam

Sampanthan & Others v. The Attorney General & Others, SC FR 351-361/2018, S.C Minutes

of 13.12.2018; W.P.S. Wijerathna v. SLPA & Others, S.C F.R Application No. 256/2017, S.C

Minutes of 11.12.2020). The Petitioner has failed to establish any of the aforementioned

elements in this application.

I find it prudent at this stage to recall observations made by me in a prior judgement where

uncertainty and a lacuna in factual narratives submitted by parties compelled the Court to

determine the standard of proof required to establish a fundamental rights violation.

In proceedings of this nature, the court has very limited avenues to test the veracity of these

assertions and necessarily have to depend on the affidavits and other documents filed. In the

circumstances, in arriving at a just and equitable decision in the realm of the fundamental

rights jurisdiction, the court necessarily has to apply the test of probability to the factual

matters placed before us. [ in Arangallage Samantha v. OIC, Police Station, Biyagama &

Others, S.C. F.R Application No. 458/2012, S.C Minutes of 28. 01. 2020, at page 8]

My observations forecited were formed in light of the astute observations of Wanasundera J

in the case of Velmurugu v The Attorney General and Others 1981 1 SLR 406 and Soza J. in

Vivienne Goonewardene v Hector Perera 1983 SLR 1 V 305. In Velmurugu, his Lordship

Justice Wanasundera stated that the test applicable for the standard of proof required to

establish a violation of fundamental rights is a preponderance of probability, as adopted in

civil cases. His Lordship further stated that although the standard is not as high as that which

is required in criminal cases, there can be different standards of probability within that

standard and the degree applicable would depend on the subject-matter of the case

concerned. In Vivienne Goonewardenes case, Soza J held that The degree of probability

required should be commensurate with the gravity of the allegation sought to be proved...The

conscience of the court must be satisfied that there has been an infringement.

In my view, the aforementioned dicta succinctly capture the standard of proof for an alleged

infringement of fundamental rights in an application under Article 126. Accordingly,

12

although the Petitioner was not required to expel all doubt in the Courts mind that the

Respondents had unlawfully, arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unjustly denied her the promotion

concerned, the Petitioner was required to produce compelling material which would satisfy

the courts conscience on a preponderance of probabilities that the Respondents had engaged

in such conduct. In this most essential requirement, the Petitioner has failed.

For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that Petitioner has failed to establish to the satisfaction

of this court that the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution had been violated, and in the circumstances, we hold that the Petitioner is

not entitled to the relief prayed.

Application Dismissed.
