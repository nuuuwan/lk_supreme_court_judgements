"“The prosecutor is at all times a minister of justice, though seldom so described. It is"
"not the duty of prosecuting counsel to secure a conviction, nor should any"
"prosecutor feel pride or satisfaction in the mere fact of success .... His attitude"
"should be so objective that he is, so far as is humanly possible, indifferent to the"

"indictment;  however,  this  discretion  is  subject  to  certain  limitations.  Any  executive"
"discretion should be exercised on constitutionally permissible factors. If a suspect is"

"decision to prosecute in such circumstances would be, prima facie, arbitrary and"
"capricious, and so would the grant of sanction.”"
"No doubt, the Attorney General enjoys unfettered discretion in almost all aspects of"
"criminal  processes;  institution  of criminal proceedings, conduct  of  prosecutions  as"
"well as discontinuing of proceedings and is not obliged to explain why a particular"
