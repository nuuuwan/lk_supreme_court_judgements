"Arrest and imprisonment, without a warrant, on a charge which does not justify"
"arrest, are unlawful and, therefore, constitute false imprisonment, whether the"
"person making the arrest is a policeman or a private individual”"
"The Court held further at page 580 that;"
"“I find it impossible to suppose that the law will hold the arrest good if it"
"subsequently appears that the officer had in his own mind an unexpressed suspicion"
"t
hat a felony had been committed.”"
"Similarly, 
the  arresting  officers  could  not  have  arrested 
the  Petitioner 
if 
the"
"allegation  was  not  well  founded.  Consequently,  the  arrest  was  defective  from  the"
"inception.  Hence,  even  if  reasons  are  given  by  the  arresting  officer,  such  reasons"
"were  also  defective.  Therefore,  I  declare  that  the  Petitioner’s  rights  under  Article"
"13(1) are infringed."
"Alleged Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution"
"Article 12(1) of the  Constitution guarantees that “All persons are equal before the"
"law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law”. The essence of Article 12(1)"
"is 
to  ensure 
that  a  person 
is  protected 
from  arbitrary,  capricious, 
irrational,"
"unreasonable,  discriminatory,  or  vexatious,  executive  or  administrative  actions."
"Delivering the judgement in the case of Rajapaksha v Rathnayake and Ten Others Sri"
"L.R 1 [2016] 119 at p. 130, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew stated that;"
"“When the 1st Respondent arrested the petitioner without any reasons and"
"f
abricated a false charge against him, can it be said that he got equal protection of"
"l
aw and that the 1st Respondent applied the principle that 'all persons are equal"
"before the law' to the petitioner? This question has to be answered and is answered"
"i
n
 
t
he negative. It is now proved that the petitioner was arrested and detained in the"
"police station without any reasons and the charge framed against him was a"
"f
abricated charge. Thus, the principle that 'all persons are equal before the law and"
"are entitled to the equal protection of the law' has not been applied to the petitioner"
"by the 1st Respondent.”"
