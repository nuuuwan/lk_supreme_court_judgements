udge  does  not  act  according  to  procedure  established  by  law,  there  is  a"
"contravention of the guarantee enshrined in Article 13(2) of the Constitution.”"
"The  procedure  established  by  law  in  which  a  detainee  is  to  be  produced  before  a"
"judge is contained in Section 36 and 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No."
"15 of 1979. Sections 36 and 37 reads as follows;"
"“A peace officer making an arrest without warrant shall without unnecessary delay"
"and  subject  to  the  provisions  herein  contained  as  to  bail  take  or  send  the  person"
"arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case”"
"“Any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested"
"without a warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is"
"reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time"
"necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate”"
"It is apparent from the above Sections that a detainee should be produced within 24"
"hours before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. Petitioner states that there"
"was  a  deliberate  attempt  to  delay  in  producing  the  Petitioner  before  a  Magistrate."
"The  arrest  notes  marked  “2R  3” 
indicate 
that 
the  Petitioner  was  arrested  on"
"15.11.2018 at approximately 23:30 at the Airport. The Petitioner disputes the time"
"of  the  arrest  as  22:30,  however,  given  that  the  Petitioner’s  flight  was  scheduled  to"
"depart  at  00:25  hours  on  16.11.2018,  it  is  highly  likely  that  the  arrest  took  place"
"between 22:30 and 23:30."
"According to the Petitioner, he was produced before the Magistrate on 16.11.2018"
"approximately  at  23:30  hours. 
If 
there  was  a  deliberate  attempt 
to  delay 
the"
"production  of  the  Petitioner,  it  is  highly  likely  that  he  would  have  been  produced"
"much later. The Petitioner was arrested on the 15.11.2018 and was produced before"
"the Magistrate on 16.11.2018, according to the B Report marked “2R 4”. Therefore,"
"it appears that he had been produced before the magistrate within 24 hours. Hence,"
"I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the Respondents had violated his"
"fundamental rights enshrined in Article 13(2)."
