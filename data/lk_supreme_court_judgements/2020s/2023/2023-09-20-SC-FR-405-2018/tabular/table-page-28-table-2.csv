"is  in  the  public  interest  that  sufficient  damages  should  be  awarded  in  instances  of"
"false imprisonment in order to give reality to the protection afforded by the law. The"
"court went on to observe that;"
"“The more high-handed and less reasonable the detention is, the larger may be the"
"damages; and, conversely, the more nearly reasonable the defendant may have acted"
"and the nearer he may have got to justification on reasonable grounds for the"
"suspicion on which he arrested, the smaller will be the proper assessment. The"
"whole of the facts will, of course, be taken into account on the new trial in order to"
"arrive at a proper figure.”"
