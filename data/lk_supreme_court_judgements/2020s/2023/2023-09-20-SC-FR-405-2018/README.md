Aluwihare, PC, J.

The Petitioner, an employee of George Steuart (Pvt) Limited, complained that his

Fundamental Rights enshrined in Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the

Constitution were violated by the Respondents. The 6th Respondent is a private party,

and the Petitioner alleges that the 6th Respondent lodged a false complaint against

him with the Criminal Investigation Department, which the Petitioner claims, led to

his arrest. On 01.02.2019, this Court granted Leave to Proceed for the alleged

violations of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner under Articles 12(1), 13(1)

and 13(2) of the Constitution.

The Factual Background

According to the Petitioner, he had been acquainted with a certain Rehana Marian

Sebastian [Hereinafter referred to as Rehana] for a long time. Sometime later, Rehana

introduced the Petitioner to her sister, presently, his wife, Stephanie Sylvia Sebastian.

The Petitioners relationship with the 6th Respondent resulted from his acquaintance

with Rehana. The Petitioner states that the 6th Respondent and Rehana had entered

into a loan agreement for a sum of Rupee Fifty-Three Million whereby Rehana had

agreed to pay back the principal with an interest of 12% per annum, to the 6th

Respondent. The Petitioners position was that he was totally oblivious to this

transaction between the 6th Respondent and Rehana, at the time the incident central

to the present application took place. At some point Rehana had approached the

Petitioner, stating that she was receiving money from a friend, namely the 6th

Respondent and had requested the Petitioner to facilitate the said transaction by

permitting that money to be credited to his bank account and provided a letter

(Marked P 13) which states that she was to receive money from a friend as a loan on

interest and that she does not have a bank account with the Sampath Bank PLC. This

request, that is to allow her friend to deposit the said money to the Petitioners

account, appears to have been made purely for their convenience. The Petitioner had

agreed because of his close relationship with Rehana and this conduct on the part of

5

the Petitioner does not appear to be unusual given the fact that Rehana was his sister

-in- law to be.

Sometime after this request was made, a sum of Rupees seven million Rupees 7,000,

000 /- was deposited to the Petitioners account in several tranches, which the

Petitioner had withdrawn and handed over to Rehana. Rehanas position was that

she repaid the amount borrowed, with interest, however, the 6th Respondent had

threatened her, which had prompted her to write to the Officer-in-Charge of

Keselwatte Police on 02.05.2018. Her sister, Stephanie also had made statements at

the Narahenpita Police and Keselwatte Police on 04.05.2018 and 18.05.2018

respectively, stating that her sister Rehana had repaid all the monies borrowed and

had submitted documents and bank slips to the police as proof of the repayment.

On 07.05.2018 the 6th Respondent had visited the Petitioners house in his absence,

and had intimated to his father that he had deposited the money to the bank account

of the Petitioner and that he will be compelled to complain to the Criminal

Investigation Department if the Petitioner fails to repay him. The 6th Respondent also

provided his mobile phone number to the father with instructions for the Petitioner

to phone the 6th Respondent. The Petitioner as requested had phoned him on the

very day itself. The Petitioners position was that, as he felt the conduct of the 6th

Respondent was dubious, therefore, he took precautions to record the conversation

he had with the 6th Respondent.

The Petitioner had, along with the petition, filed a transcript of this conversation.

Throughout the conversation the Petitioner denies knowledge of any transaction

between the 6th Respondent and Rehana. Moreover, the 6th Respondent provided

several unrelated and convoluted reasons for depositing the money to the Petitioners

account and had threatened to have a complaint lodged at the FCID. Importantly,

throughout the conversation, there is no mention whatsoever by the 6th Respondent

regarding any agreement or an arrangement between the Petitioner, Rehana and

himself to import two BMW vehicles for his use. The significance of this omission

will be apparent later. The very next day i.e., 08.05. 2018, the Petitioner had lodged

6

a complaint against the 6th Respondent at the Narahenpita police, alleging criminal

intimidation.

On 01.06.2018 the 6th Respondent had lodged a complaint with the Criminal

Investigation Department [Hereinafter the CID] complaining that the Petitioner and

Rehana defrauded the 6th Respondent of seven million rupees [Rs.7.0 million] by

agreeing to import two BMW vehicles on behalf the 6th Respondent. He further

claimed that the Petitioner and Rehana are avoiding the 6th Respondent. No

documentation is available before this Court as proof of the existence of this

purported Agreement or any communications between the Petitioner and the 6th

Respondent to indicate such an arrangement or agreement was negotiated between

the parties. The only documents produced by the 6th Respondent are the bank slips

indicating that seven million Rupees were deposited into the account of the

Petitioner in several transactions. The Petitioner, however, has not denied the receipt

of the money but has explained that the money was received to facilitate the

transaction between the 6th Respondent and Rehana, which was referred to earlier. It

is also important to note that, as referred to earlier, nowhere during the phone

conversation on 07.05.2018, between the 6th Respondent and the Petitioner, the 6th

Respondent refers to any agreement to import vehicles, although several unrelated

accusations had been made by the 6th Respondent against the Petitioner. Thus, the

basis of the complaint to the CID, which was made three weeks after the telephone

conversation, appears to be an entirely new accusation made by the 6th Respondent.

The objections filed by the Respondent CID officers, do not give details of the

investigations and/or steps taken by the CID in pursuance of the 6th Respondents

complaint. What is more shocking is that, after the complaint was made against the

Petitioner, no attempt appears to have been made by the CID officers to notice the

Petitioner of the complaint made against him nor had independently verified the

truth of the allegation. Instead, the 2nd Respondent claims that the Petitioner was

absconding. In the B Report dated 19.09.2018 (which is more than four and a half

months after the complaint) filed by the CID officers marked 2R 1 it is stated that

7

there is reliable information that the Petitioner was attempting to travel abroad to

evade justice and on that basis a travel ban under Section 51C (1) of the Immigrants

and Emigrants Act (as amended) was sought from the Learned Magistrate of the

Wattala and it was issued on the same day. No document was produced as proof of

any notice being issued to the Petitioner. The Petitioner on the other hand had

produced taxi bills as evidence of his travels he made from his residential area as

proof that he was very much in the area where he lived and had made no attempt to

abscond.

Oblivious to all these events, the Petitioner had planned to travel overseas to China

and Malaysia on holiday in November 2018, which was five months after the initial

complaint. On arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport on 15.11.2018 to

board a flight scheduled to depart, he was informed at the Immigration Counter that

he was charged with an offence, and a travel ban is in operation. The Petitioner

states that this was the first time he was informed of any allegation or charge against

him by the authorities. According to the Petitioner, he was arrested by a CID officer.

The arrest notes marked 2R 3 indicate that the Petitioner was arrested at 23:20

hours. According to the Petitioner, despite making several inquiries to ascertain

information about the offence he had allegedly committed, the only information

divulged was that it was related to the financial fraud of seven million Rupees.

Some officers of the CID had arrived from Colombo and had taken over the custody

of the Petitioner. Once in Colombo, he was informed that he had misappropriated

and/or defrauded money at the behest of one Rehana. The Petitioner was further

informed that he was arrested on a complaint made by one Maheepala Saveen

Chathuranga Gunaratne, (the 6th Respondent), for defrauding or misappropriating

seven million Rupees. The said complaint alleges that the Petitioner committed

criminal breach of trust by obtaining 7 million rupees on a promise to import two

BMW vehicles on behalf of the 6th Respondent and that the Petitioner was

introduced to the 6th Respondent by Rehana.

8

Subsequently, the Petitioner was produced by the 2nd Respondent before the Learned

Acting Magistrate of the Wattala on 16.11.2018 who refused to enlarge him on bail,

as the CID officers informed the court, that further time is required to conduct

investigations. The Petitioner had been remanded until 19.11.2018 and on

19.11.2018, it was submitted that a statement had not yet been taken from the

Petitioner and the Petitioner was further remanded till 23.11.2018, on which date

Bail was finally granted, after having been incarcerated for 8 days.

Petitioner filed the present petition on 13.12.2018 seeking relief and during the

pendency of this matter, the Hon. Attorney General on 23.07.2019 had forwarded

an indictment in terms of Section 400 of the Penal Code against the Petitioner.

I shall now consider the alleged violations of the Fundamental rights of the

Petitioner.

Alleged Violation of Article 13(2) of the Constitution

Article 13 (2) provides that; Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise

deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest

competent court according to procedure established by law, and shall not be further

held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms

of the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law

As held in Farook v Raymond and Others [1996] 1 Sri L.R 217,

the object of Article 13(2) of the Constitution is to afford a person who has been

deprived of his personal liberty by executive action, to have the benefit of placing

his case before a neutral person a judge so that a judicial mind may be applied to

the circumstances and an impartial determination made in accordance with the

applicable law. The provision is designed to eliminate arbitrariness in depriving a

person of his liberty, and this extends to the exclusion of arbitrariness on the part of

a judge who orders that a person brought before him be further held in custody,

detained or deprived of personal liberty. If in depriving a person of his liberty a

9

judge does not act according to procedure established by law, there is a

contravention of the guarantee enshrined in Article 13(2) of the Constitution.

The procedure established by law in which a detainee is to be produced before a

judge is contained in Section 36 and 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979. Sections 36 and 37 reads as follows;

A peace officer making an arrest without warrant shall without unnecessary delay

and subject to the provisions herein contained as to bail take or send the person

arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case

Any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested

without a warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is

reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time

necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate

It is apparent from the above Sections that a detainee should be produced within 24

hours before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. Petitioner states that there

was a deliberate attempt to delay in producing the Petitioner before a Magistrate.

The arrest notes marked 2R 3 indicate that the Petitioner was arrested on

15.11.2018 at approximately 23:30 at the Airport. The Petitioner disputes the time

of the arrest as 22:30, however, given that the Petitioners flight was scheduled to

depart at 00:25 hours on 16.11.2018, it is highly likely that the arrest took place

between 22:30 and 23:30.

According to the Petitioner, he was produced before the Magistrate on 16.11.2018

approximately at 23:30 hours. If there was a deliberate attempt to delay the

production of the Petitioner, it is highly likely that he would have been produced

much later. The Petitioner was arrested on the 15.11.2018 and was produced before

the Magistrate on 16.11.2018, according to the B Report marked 2R 4. Therefore,

it appears that he had been produced before the magistrate within 24 hours. Hence,

I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the Respondents had violated his

fundamental rights enshrined in Article 13(2).

10

Alleged Violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution

The personal liberties of a person are protected from arbitrary arrest by Article

13(1) of the Constitution. Article 13(1) provides that No person shall be arrested

except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be

informed of the reason for his arrest. The procedure established by law for

arresting a person without a Warrant is set out in Chapter IV B (Sections 3243) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

According to the 2nd Respondents affidavit, it is stated [paragraph 6(c)] that the

Petitioner could not be found in his usual place of abode when the police visited his

residence in order to record a statement. Thereafter, the facts were reported to the

Learned Magistrate in the Magistrate Court of Wattala by way of a B report dated

19.09.2018 marked 2R 1 and a travel ban was sought and was issued by the

Learned Magistrate on the same day. Subsequently, the Petitioner was arrested on

15.11.2018 at the Airport. Therefore, it is apparent that the Petitioner was arrested

without a warrant.

The Respondents justify the arrest by resorting to Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Code. Section 32(1)(b) provides that;

(1) Any peace officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a

warrant, arrest any person-

(a) who in his presence commits any breach of the peace;

(b) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a

reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been

received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned;

Even to make an arrest under Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

reasonable suspicion must exist of the suspect having been concerned with a

11

cognizable offence in the mind of the police officer effecting the arrest. The test is

objective, and an arrest made purely on subjective grounds or on a general or vague

suspicion would be arbitrary. What would amount to a reasonable suspicion? The

requirement is limited and is not equated with prima facie proof of the commission

of the offence. As stated, however, by His Lordship Justice Amarasinghe in Channa

Pieris and Others v. Attorney General and Others [1994] 1 Sri L.R 1 at p. 46

A reasonable suspicion may be based either upon matters within the officers

knowledge or upon credible information furnished to him, or upon a combination

of both sources.

Police officers cannot mechanically make an arrest upon a mere complaint received,

without forming the opinion that the allegation is credible. Thus, a police officer is

required to make necessary investigations, unless the facts are obvious, to verify

whether the complaint is credible or whether the information provided is reliable.

An arrest upon a general or vague suspicion would lead to significantly abridging

the personal liberties guaranteed to a person by the Constitution. Therefore, an

element of prudence is required from police officers before making an arrest to

verify the allegation. This requirement, in my view, applies with greater force in

white collar crimes. The reason being, it needs to be ascertained whether the

impugned transaction is purely a commercial transaction which had gone wrong or

whether the suspect had the intent to defraud.

As held in Gamlath v Neville Silva and Others [1991] 2 Sri L.R 267;

A suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was founded on

matters within the Police Officers own knowledge or on statements made by other

persons in a way which justify him giving them credit.

Moreover, the principle laid by Lord Devlin in Shaaban Bin Hussien v Chong Fook

Kam [1969] 3 All ER 1626 at 1630 is relevant to the instant case. As a general rule,

an arrest should not be made until the investigation is complete. Still, the legislature

allows police officers to affect an arrest before the completion of the investigation in

12

certain circumstances; this is to avoid the investigation process being hampered and

in order to maintain the law and order in the country. But to give the power to arrest

on a reasonable suspicion does not mean that it should always be or even ordinarily

be exercised. It means that there is executive discretion. In the exercise of such

discretion, many factors must be considered. Besides the strength of the case, the

possibility of escape, obstruction of the investigation, prevention of further crimes,

and the threat of the accused to the public are some of the factors a police officer

may consider. Thus, it appears the strength of the case is a critical factor in making

an arrest. In the words of Lord Devlin;

It is indeed desirable as a general rule that an arrest should not be made until the

case is complete. But if arrest before that were forbidden, it could seriously hamper

the police. To give power to arrest on reasonable suspicion does not mean that it is

always or even ordinarily to be exercised. It means that there is an executive

discretion. In the exercise of it many factors have to be considered besides the

strength of the case. The possibility of escape, the prevention of further crime and

the obstruction of police enquiries are examples of those factors with which all

judges who have had to grant or refuse bail are familiar.

When one considers the material that was available at the point of arrest, it cannot

be said that the Respondents had a reasonable suspicion that the Petitioner

committed an offence. The Respondents purely acted on the complaint made by the

6th Respondent, which is evident by the B report dated 19.09.2018 marked 2R 1.

There is no material before this court indicating that the CID officers had conducted

any investigations to verify the allegation and only had bank receipts provided by the

6th Respondent as evidence, which merely indicated that money was deposited into

the Petitioners account. It is clear that the officers of the CID had acted on the

complaint without making any attempt to verify the complaint independently or

attempting to verify whether the complaint of the 6th Respondent was creditworthy.

At best, the CID officers could have suspected a commercial transaction existed

between the 6th Respondent and the Petitioner to import vehicles, and there is

13

nothing illegal in engaging in a commercial transaction of that nature. On an

objective assessment, investigating officers would require additional credible

information to form the opinion of a reasonable suspicion of a commission of an

offence. Evidence nor any material to form such a suspicion was placed before this

Court.

Moreover, the Court cannot accept that the CID officers had reasons to believe that

the Petitioner was evading justice. The Petitioner was in the country for a period of

more than five months from the initial date of the complaint, and even after a travel

ban was sought, the Petitioner was in the country for nearly two months. It was

pointed out that, if the Petitioner wished to evade justice, he could easily have made

an attempt to travel to a country with a visa-on-arrival concession was available,

instead of making arrangements to travel to China and Malaysia, two countries that

require prior visa approval. Every person is entitled to enjoy the freedom of

movement within and without the country, a fundamental right guaranteed under

Article 14(1) (h) of the Constitution, and as delineated by Article 4(d) of the

Constitution, it is the duty of the State and its agencies, not to act in a manner to

abridge, restrict or deny such right. This Constitutional duty cast must be respected

and adhered to by all persons concerned without an exception. In this backdrop,

when seeking a judicial order preventing a person travelling overseas, such an order

can only be sought in situations where the officer concerned is possessed of credible

information that the suspect is likely to flee the country and not otherwise.

Necessity to Inform the Reason for the Arrest of the Petitioner

Article 13(1) requires a person to be informed of the reason for the arrest. Justice

Sharvananda states the purpose of this requirement in his treatise, Fundamental

Rights in Sri Lanka on page 141 as;

Meant to afford the earliest opportunity to him to remove any mistake,

misapprehension or misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting authority and to

disabuse the latters mind of the suspicion which triggered the arrest and also for

14

the arrested person to know exactly what allegation or accusation against him is so

that he can consult his attorney-at-law and be advised by him.

Further, Section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the person

making an arrest to inform the person to be arrested of the nature of the charge or

allegation upon which he is arrested. This requirement aims to ensure that the

person arrested is afforded the opportunity to challenge the arrest at the earliest

opportunity. A particular form is not required for the notification, nor does it

require a complete detailed description of the charges against the suspect. The

requirement is for the arrested person to be told in simple, non-technical language

that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest at the

earliest reasonable opportunity. Justice Sharvananda in his treatise (supra), on page

141 in this regard, went on to state that;

All the material facts and particulars which form the foundation of the arrest must

be furnished to the arrested person because they are the reasons or grounds for his

arrest to enable the arrested person to understand why he has been arrested.

Further, it is important that the communication of the reasons should be in a

language that the arrestee understands. The adequacy of the reasons for arrest

require that they are: (a) such as to prima facie warrant arrest and (b) based upon

information which is considered reliable

The Petitioner contends that at the time of the arrest, the CID officer that arrested

him at the Airport merely informed him that he was arrested on a charge that was

related to the financial fraud of seven million rupees. Meanwhile, the arrest note

marked 2R 3 produced by the 2nd Respondent states that;

11

/ 1505/18

2320 84/90, ,

.

15

It is pertinent to observe that even the arrest note produced does not state the

substance of the allegation or charge against the Petitioner and only provides a

vague statement that the reasons for the arrest were given. Informing that the

Petitioner was arrested on a complaint related to the financial fraud of seven million

Rupees is not sufficient for the Petitioner to understand the legal and factual grounds

for his arrest. The requirement is to ensure that the arrested person is aware of the

reasons relied on to deprive his liberty. In the present case, the information divulged

was insufficient in our view for the Petitioner to appreciate the allegation or

accusation against him.

On the other hand, even if the CID officer that arrested the Petitioner stated the

allegation or charge against him, the allegation must be one that is be based on

information well founded. Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

provides for the arrest of a person concerned with a cognizable offence without a

warrant if there is a reasonable complaint, credible information or reasonable

suspicion against such person. Therefore, a person cannot be arrested on a vague

allegation. It must be based on information well-founded, and only if the allegation

or charge against a person is well-founded can the accused be produced before a

Magistrate as per Section 114 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code. Otherwise,

the accused has to be released on an execution of a bond.

Parroting a vague allegation to the Petitioner cannot excuse the Respondent's liability

under Article 13(1) of the Constitution. If the allegation was vague, then there were

no reasons for the arrest. If there were no reasons for the arrest to begin with, then

there was no charge or allegation to inform the Petitioner. The right to arrest and the

duty to submit are correlative. A person having lawful authority to deprive the

liberty of another person must know the reasons for the arrest, otherwise, it will

constitute false imprisonment. As held in Christie and Another v Leachinsky [1947]

1 All ER 567 at 579

The omission to tell a person who is arrested at, or within a reasonable time of, the

arrest with what offence he is charged cannot be regarded as a mere irregularity.

16

Arrest and imprisonment, without a warrant, on a charge which does not justify

arrest, are unlawful and, therefore, constitute false imprisonment, whether the

person making the arrest is a policeman or a private individual

The Court held further at page 580 that;

I find it impossible to suppose that the law will hold the arrest good if it

subsequently appears that the officer had in his own mind an unexpressed suspicion

that a felony had been committed.

Similarly, the arresting officers could not have arrested the Petitioner if the

allegation was not well founded. Consequently, the arrest was defective from the

inception. Hence, even if reasons are given by the arresting officer, such reasons

were also defective. Therefore, I declare that the Petitioners rights under Article

13(1) are infringed.

Alleged Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees that All persons are equal before the

law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. The essence of Article 12(1)

is to ensure that a person is protected from arbitrary, capricious, irrational,

unreasonable, discriminatory, or vexatious, executive or administrative actions.

Delivering the judgement in the case of Rajapaksha v Rathnayake and Ten Others Sri

L.R 1 [2016] 119 at p. 130, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew stated that;

When the 1st Respondent arrested the petitioner without any reasons and

fabricated a false charge against him, can it be said that he got equal protection of

law and that the 1st Respondent applied the principle that 'all persons are equal

before the law' to the petitioner? This question has to be answered and is answered

in the negative. It is now proved that the petitioner was arrested and detained in the

police station without any reasons and the charge framed against him was a

fabricated charge. Thus, the principle that 'all persons are equal before the law and

are entitled to the equal protection of the law' has not been applied to the petitioner

by the 1st Respondent.

17

It is explicit that the power of arrest cannot be exercised arbitrarily. It would deny

the equal protection of the law to the Petitioner. In the present case, the arrest was

made, merely on the complaint without any verification of the allegation made.

Moreover, the Respondents had ample opportunity to check the veracity of the

allegation since the arrest was made after five months from the initial complaint.

The 6th Respondent had provided the telephone number of the Petitioner to the CID

when the initial complaint was made. In the objections filed on behalf of the 1st to

the 8th Respondents, which are sparse to say the least, it is averred that the

Petitioner could not be found in his usual place of abode when the police visited his

residence. The objections do not disclose the date and time they visited the

residence of the Petitioner and how many such attempts were made. If he was not at

his residence, did they leave the contact number of the investigating officer with any

inmate of his residence, requesting the Petitioner to contact the CID? What

prevented them from acting under Section 109(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code,

a provision which all law enforcement agencies regularly resort to, in order to

compel persons to attend the office of the law enforcement agency, in the instant

case the CID. What prevented CID officers, from calling the Petitioner on his

telephone as the number was available to the CID? If any of these steps were taken,

in all probability they would have secured the presence of the Petitioner and would

have provided the CID officers with an opportunity to question and verify the

complaint and the Petitioner could have directed the CID officers to the police

complaints made to the Keselwatte Police and Narahenpita Police Station on

numerous instances, thereby allowing him the opportunity to purge any suspicion.

The credibility of the 6th Respondents version is also suspect and appears to be low.

It is unlikely for a person to import high-end luxury vehicles without entering into

some agreement, which provides for the particulars of the transaction, before

parting with money. It is common knowledge that unlike any other merchandise,

when placing an order for a vehicle the specifications of the vehicle matters. The

engine configuration, the options the buyer would want the vehicle to be equipped

with, the colour and the list goes on. In addition, the mode of liability, method of

18

payment are all factors that any reasonable party will consider before entering into a

similar transaction, therefore, parties are bound to leave behind a paper trail.

Whether such a high end vehicle can be imported for a sum of Rs.7.0 million is

also questionable. In the complaint of the Petitioner, he does not disclose the cost it

would incur to import each vehicle.

According to the complaint made by the 6th Respondent to the CID, he states that

somewhere in 2017, at the residence of Rehana, he had met both Rehana and the

Petitioner regarding the importation of two BMW vehicles, which the petitioner had

denied. The arrangement, according to the 6th Respondent, was for Rehana to import

a BMW X5 and the Petitioner to import a BMW 318i. Accordingly, he had credited

Rs. 23.4 million to Rehana and Rs. 7.0 million to the Petitioner in July and August

2017, expecting the vehicles to arrive in December 2017. The vehicles, however,

had not arrived according to the 6th Respondent. Going by the version of the 6th

Respondent, it was a joint arrangement of both Rehana and the Petitioner to source

the two vehicles. Strangely, the 6th Respondent had lodged a complaint only against

Rehana leaving out the Petitioner and subsequently followed it up by lodging a

separate complaint against the Petitioner. The complaint against the Petitioner had

been made on the 1st June 2018, however the date of the complaint against Rehana

is not available to the court.

In spite of the fact that the vehicles had not arrived even by December as alleged, the

6th Respondent had given a loan of Rupees fifty-three million [RS.53.0 million] to

Rehana in December 2017, at 12% interest payable in three months. The loan

agreement, a notarially attested document has been produced marked P12.

According to the Petitioner, the 6th Respondent had visited his house at a time when

he was not at home and had instilled fear in his father to the effect that he would get

the Petitioner remanded for 3 months as he has lodged a complaint with the CID.

The 6th Respondent also had said that he credited Rs.7.0 million to the petitioners

account and had left his telephone number with his father.

19

The Petitioner states that, as he has had no previous interactions with the 6th

Respondent, he phoned him up straight away and took the precaution to record the

conversation. The transcript of the conversation has been produced marked P19.

It is clear from the transcript that there is no mention whatsoever regarding an

arrangement for importation of vehicles. In the course of the telephone

conversation, the 6th Respondent clearly says that he credited to the Petitioners

account as requested by Rehana as she required money to place an order to import

ointments. It is also clear from the transcript that this was the first conversation

between the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent and that they had not known to each

other before.

From the above, along with other material produced by the respective parties to this

application, it is clear that the version of the 6th Respondent is bereft of any

credence, and his complaint appears to be a concocted one.

After the telephone conversation, as referred to earlier, the Petitioner had lodged a

complaint against the 6th Respondent at the Narahenpita police on the very next day,

i.e. on 08.05.2018, alleging criminal intimidation. The Respondents, however, in

particular the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, had not considered any of these material

facts and merely acted on the word and on the Bank slips provided by the 6th

Respondent. I wish to reiterate that, especially in cases where financial fraud is

alleged, it is incumbent on the investigating agency to ascertain whether it is purely a

transaction commercial in nature or whether a criminal element is present. As far as

this incident, was concerned, this aspect was an essential part of the investigation,

which the CID officers had to carry out before proceeding to place the Petitioner in

custody. In the circumstances I hold that the arrest of the Petitioner is arbitrary,

irrational, and unreasonable and had deprived the Petitioner the equal protection of

the law guaranteed to him under the Constitution. Thus, I declare that the 1st to the

3rd Respondents had infringed the Petitioners fundamental right under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution.

Liability of the 6th Respondent

20

The 6th Respondent was absent and unrepresented when this application was

supported for leave to proceed, nor was he represented when this matter was taken

up for argument, although notice was issued to him, on no less than four occasions.

After the arguments were concluded, however, in the interest of justice, the Court

took the additional step of issuing notice on the 6th Respondent for the fifth time,

through the Officer-in-Charge of the Sapugaskanda Police Station. On 23.03.2023

he was represented by Counsel and sought permission to file objections on behalf of

the 6th Respondent, which was permitted.

As per the statement of objections filed by the 6th Respondent, he states as per

paragraph 5(f) and 5(g) that;

That the petitioner although has taken money never took steps to import one BMW

318i car as agreed and just passed time making various excuses and thereafter never

answered the phone. The said Rehana who also had taken 23 million from the 6th

Respondent did not take steps to import BMW 5 car as agreed and ceased all

contacts with the 6th Respondent

That thereafter the 6th Respondent made separate complaints against the said Rehana

and the Petitioner at the CID. The 6th Respondent handed over the original deposit

slips to the CID during the investigation regarding the said complains and the

Petitioner has also admitted that he received money

The complaint made by the 6th Respondent against the Petitioner is certainly false.

This can be gleaned from the background facts. During the phone conversation

between the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent on 07.05.2018 as said earlier, there is

no mention of any agreement to import vehicles, by the 6th Respondent. Parties are

likely to negotiate in depth any commercial arrangement, but no evidence was

forthcoming from the 6th Respondent as proof of such an agreement. Hence,

considering the material that is available at this point of time, the inference that can

be drawn is that the complaint made by the 6th Respondent is false and bereft of any

truth.

21

The entire process that culminated in the arrest of the Petitioner was instigated by

the 6th Respondent and consequently resulted in the breach of the Petitioners

fundamental rights. I am of the opinion that this is a fit matter to apply the principle

laid down in the case of Faiz v Attorney General and Others Sri L.R 1 [1995] 372. In

the case of Faiz [supra], his Lordship Justice Mark Fernando stated;

Article 126 speaks of an infringement by executive or administrative action; it does

not impose a further requirement this action must be by an executive officer. It

follows at the act of a private individual would render him liable, if in the

circumstances that act is "executive or administrative". The act of a private

individual would be executive if such act is done with the authority of the executive

such authority; transforms an otherwise purely private act into executive or

administrative action; Such authority may be express, or implied from prior or

concurrent acts manifesting approval, instigation, connivance, acquiescence,

participation and the like (including inaction in circumstances where there is a duty

to act); and from subsequent acts which manifest ratification or adoption. While I

use concepts and terminology of the law relating to agency, and vicarious liability in

delict, in my view responsibility under Article 126 would extend to all situations in

which the nexus between the individual and the executive makes it equitable to

attribute such responsibility. The executive, and the executive officers from whom

such authority flows would all be responsible for the infringement. Conversely,

when an infringement by an executive officer, by executive or administrative action,

is directly and effectively the consequence of the act of a private individual (whether

by reason of instigation, connivance, participation or otherwise) such individual is

also responsible for the executive or administrative action and the infringement

caused thereby. In any event this Court would have power under Article 126(4) to

make orders and directions against such an individual in order to afford relief to the

victim. [emphasis added]

As we have concluded that the arrest of the Petitioner was arbitrary and

unreasonable and that the arrest was a direct consequence of the instigation on the

22

part the 6th Respondent by making a complaint which was false, the 6th Respondent

cannot avoid liability. In the process of protecting the Fundamental Rights of the

citizenry, the Court cannot condone private parties instigating the executive to use

its powers to achieve their ulterior motives unreasonably and/or in an arbitrary

manner. Permitting such conduct would lead to a breakdown of the Rule of Law

and erode public confidence, as such, infractions should be frowned upon by this

Court.

The Decision to Indict the Petitioner.

When this matter was taken up, on 12.11.2011, the Court inquired from the

learned State Counsel whether the transcript of the telephone conversation dated

07.05.2018, between the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent was considered before

forwarding the indictment. Requested by the Court, the learned State Counsel

produced the file pertaining to the Petitioner containing the decision to forward the

indictment against him. Upon perusal of the said file by the Court, it was observed

that;

1. The material relating to the telephone conversation between the Petitioner and the

6th Respondent had not been considered by the Learned State Counsel before

deciding to forward the indictment.

2. Other than the bare statement stating that the Complainant had deposited a sum

of Rupees Seven Million in the Bank Account of the Petitioner no other material

whatsoever had been considered by the Learned State Counsel to establish the

requisite ingredients, in particular the requisite mental element of the offence of

cheating

3. Further, the Learned State Counsel had paid scant regard as to whether the facts

relating to this case makes out an offence of cheating and whether the material is

sufficient to establish the offence.

Neither a declaration nor any relief was sought in relation to the indictment against

the Petitioner. The Court, however, cannot ignore the scant regard the Learned State

23

Counsel had paid when forwarding the indictment. I am reminded of the dicta of

his Lordship Justice Sansoni in the case of The Attorney General vs. Sivapragasam et

al, 60 NLR 468 at p. 471,

The prosecutor is at all times a minister of justice, though seldom so described. It is

not the duty of prosecuting counsel to secure a conviction, nor should any

prosecutor feel pride or satisfaction in the mere fact of success .... His attitude

should be so objective that he is, so far as is humanly possible, indifferent to the

result

Similar views were echoed by His Lordship Justice Mark Fernando in the case of

Victor Ivon vs. Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General and Others [1998]1 Sri. L.R. 340 at

p. 344. The Attorney General has a statutory discretion and the decision to file an

indictment; however, this discretion is subject to certain limitations. Any executive

discretion should be exercised on constitutionally permissible factors. If a suspect is

indicted by the Attorney General when the evidence was plainly insufficient, it

would be prima facie arbitrary or capricious. In the words of His Lordship Justice

Mark Fernando;

If a person complains that he was criminally defamed at a public meeting, at which

he was not present, and the only witness he has, as to the actual words spoken, is a

person who is quite hard of hearing, could sanction be granted, without any further

investigation, and without the statement of the accused having been recorded? A

decision to prosecute in such circumstances would be, prima facie, arbitrary and

capricious, and so would the grant of sanction.

No doubt, the Attorney General enjoys unfettered discretion in almost all aspects of

criminal processes; institution of criminal proceedings, conduct of prosecutions as

well as discontinuing of proceedings and is not obliged to explain why a particular

decision was taken either to indict or not to indict an individual. Prosecutorial

discretion is an essential element of our criminal justice system and is also critical to

the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice. However, the right to a fair

24

administration of justice holds so prominent a place in a democratic society that it

cannot be sacrificed at the altar of expediency.

The decision to prosecute is a serious step that affects suspects, victims, witnesses

and the public at large and must be undertaken with the utmost care. Many

common law jurisdictions apply a two- stage test in deciding whether or not to

initiate a prosecution; that is evidential sufficiency and the public interest. In

assessing the sufficiency of evidence, the prosecutor should consider, the

admissibility, the reliability and the credibility of the material. The evidence of the

defence and any argument which might be put forth should be weighed before

asking whether it is more likely than not a court would convict the accused. There

must be a rigorous examination of the case to ensure that indictments are not made

prematurely. Before indictments are filed, the Attorney General should consider if

there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person to be indicted has

committed the offence, or if further evidence can be obtained to provide a realistic

prospect of conviction, or if the seriousness or the circumstances of the case justifies

the making of an immediate decision to file indictments or if it is in the public

interest to file indictments against the suspect.

In the instant case, the indicting State Counsel had only to consider the statement

made by the Petitioner along with the transcript of the telephone conversation to

assess the truthfulness of the complaint, which unfortunately had not happened.

The complaint itself is fraught with improbabilities. The version of the Petitioner,

the telephone conversation, and the fact that the 6th Respondent had given Rs.53.0

million to Rehana in December, which was five months after the purported vehicle

transaction as alleged [by the 6th Respondent] that both the Petitioner and Rehana

were jointly involved, negates any criminal intent on the part of the Petitioner.

It is regrettable neither the indicting State Counsel nor the officer who supervised

and sanctioned the indictment, had failed in their duty to consider the facts

objectively before taking the decision to indict the Petitioner.

25

The two decisions [Sivapragasam and Victor Ivan] referred to above and the

jurisprudence of this court has spelt out that the discretion vested in the Attorney

General, as a public prosecutor, is constitutionally protected and this discretion had

been reviewed by this court, thus the jurisprudence permits this court to consider

any challenge to the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion statutorily vested with

the Attorney General.

Although the discretion of the Attorney General regarding forwarding of

indictments is reviewable, the circumstances in which the Court will intervene are

rare. Prosecutorial powers are entrusted to identified officers and no other authority

can exercise them or make judgments; it is not within the Courts constitutional

function to assess the merits of the polycentric character of official decision-making

in such matters. The Court will only intervene when the decision is prima facie,

arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.

Needless to state that the mental trauma one must undergo in facing criminal

charges and for that matter an incitement before the High Court would be

considerable. The impact of it would be greater if the person charged was of some

social standing.

Conclusions

We are of the opinion that the Petitioner has been successful in establishing that his

Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12(1), and 13(2) of the Constitution had

been violated by the Respondents and the court proceeds to make a declaration to

that effect.

When one considers the chain of events, it would be reasonable to draw the

conclusion that the 6th Respondent had made a false complaint, as far as the matters

impugned in these proceedings and had taken advantage of the mechanism of the

criminal justice system to achieve his dubious objectives.

I agree with the view expressed by Justice Mark Fernando in the case Faiz v. The

Attorney General [supra] when his Lordship said; .. when an infringement by

26

an executive officer, by executive or administrative action, is directly and effectively

the consequence of the act of a private individual (whether by reason of instigation,

connivance, participation or otherwise) such individual is also responsible for the

executive or administrative action and the infringement caused thereby. In any event

this Court would have power under Article 126(4) to make orders and directions

against such an individual in order to afford relief to the victim [at page 383].

As stated earlier, the facts amply demonstrate that the whole process that triggered

the action of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents which led to the infringement of the

Petitioners fundamental rights was instigated by the 6th Respondent.

Accordingly, this Court declares that the 1st 2nd and 3rd Respondents had violated the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner under Articles 12(1) and 13(2) of the

Constitution. The violations aforesaid was either induced or instigated by the 6th

Respondent, who therefore is also responsible for the violations.

His Lordship Justice Kulatunga in the case Shaul Hameed and Another v Ranasinghe

1990 1 SLR 104, observed; [at page 119]

This Court has the power to make an appropriate order even against a respondent

who has no executive status where such respondent is proved to be guilty of

impropriety or connivance with the executive in the wrongful acts violative of

fundamental rights or even otherwise, where in the interest of justice it becomes

necessary to deprive a respondent of the advantages to be derived from executive acts

violative of fundamental rights e. g. an order for the payment of damages or for the

restoration of property to the petitioner. Article 126 (4) provides that The Supreme

Court shall have the power to grant such relief or make such directions as it may

deem just and equitable in the circumstances in respect of any petition or reference

referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3) or this Article......". The power of this Court to

grant relief is thus very wide. Such power has been expressly conferred to make the

remedy under Article 126 (2) meaningful.

27

I agree with the observation made by Justice Kulatunga referred to above and I am

of the view that the Petitioner should be entitled to compensation for the violations

aforesaid.

I am also of the opinion that we are bestowed with great latitude in terms of

granting relief under Article 126 of the Constitution and when this Court orders

compensation for the violation of a Fundamental Right it is awarded by way of

acknowledgement of regret and a solatium for the hurt caused by the violation. As

held by His Lordship Justice Amarasinghe in Saman v Leeladasa Sri L.R 1 [1989] 1 at

p. 42;

When, in an appropriate case, compensation is awarded for the violation of a

Fundamental Right, it is, I think, by way of an acknowledgement of regret and a

solatium for the hurt caused by the violation of a fundamental right and not as a

punishment for duty disregarded or authority abused.

I am also of the view that the 6th Respondent, being a private party, should also be

ordered to pay compensation. The 6th Respondents actions had led to considerable

disruption of the Petitioners life; his plans to embark on a holiday came to an

abrupt halt and had to suffer incarceration in remand custody followed by an

indictment on a charge of cheating. All these events, no doubt, would have impacted

adversely on his life and possibly would have tarnished his reputation as well. This

Court would be failing in its bounden duty if we were to ignore the grievance

caused to the Petitioner or condone the conduct of the 6th Respondent.

I must also add that although His Lordship Justice Amarasinghe opined in Saman v

Leeladasa [supra] that deterrence should not be considered as a relevant element in

the assessment of compensation, those opinions were limited to State liability, as the

depths of the State coffers is vast, and the burden of large awards will inevitably

pass to the taxpayer. But in my opinion deterrence is a relevant element when the

Fundamental Rights violation is a result of instigation by a private party. Private

parties should be deterred from instigating the executive to use its powers to achieve

their ulterior motives unreasonably and/or in an arbitrary manner.

28

In this regard I am guided by the judgement of Dumbell v Roberts [1944] 1 All ER at

pg. 330, where it was held that no person should be arrested by the police except on

grounds which in the particular circumstances of the arrest justify the

entertainment of a reasonable suspicion. And that, English Law has recognized that

is in the public interest that sufficient damages should be awarded in instances of

false imprisonment in order to give reality to the protection afforded by the law. The

court went on to observe that;

The more high-handed and less reasonable the detention is, the larger may be the

damages; and, conversely, the more nearly reasonable the defendant may have acted

and the nearer he may have got to justification on reasonable grounds for the

suspicion on which he arrested, the smaller will be the proper assessment. The

whole of the facts will, of course, be taken into account on the new trial in order to

arrive at a proper figure.

Although the judgement was concerned with appeal from an action for false

imprisonment, I believe the instance case is one that is apt to apply the principle

enunciated in Dumbell v Roberts [supra], as the spectrum of unlawful arrests and

false imprisonments are wide, and the compensations should reflect the events and

bereavements of the Petitioner.

However, I am inclined to include a word of caution. The quantum of compensation

reflected by the final Order of this Court should not be construed as the rule. It is

very much the exception, especially when making an order regarding payment of

compensation against a private party as oppose to the state and it should be done

only upon carefully weighing the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court is

mindful not to unleash a pandoras box. Hence, the compensation granted by the

Court is reflected by the circumstances of this case.

Taking into account the facts and circumstance that led to the violation of the

Petitioners' fundamental rights, this Court makes order as follows;

29

1. 1st Respondent is directed to pay a sum of Rs. 75,000.00 as compensation to the

Petitioner.

2. Each of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are directed to pay a sum of Rs, 25,000/- as

compensation to the petitioner.

3. The 6th Respondent is directed to pay a sum of Rupees three million [Rs.3.0

million] to the Petitioner as compensation.
