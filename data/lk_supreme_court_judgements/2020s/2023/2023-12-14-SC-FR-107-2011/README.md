S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner, namely Weheragedara Ranjith Sumangala (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Petitioner), filed this application on 28th March 2011 against the 1st

to 6th Respondents (hereinafter sometimes jointly referred to as Respondents)

seeking relief in respect of the alleged infringement of his fundamental rights

guaranteed by and under the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka. Accordingly, on 26th April 2011, when the case was called for support, State

Counsel representing the Respondents pleaded for time to be granted in order to

expeditiously obtain instructions regarding the injuries purportedly sustained by the

Petitioner. Thereafter, as the Respondents have not filed limited objections, on 30th

May 2011, the Court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of Articles 11,

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 60

12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution in the manner and circumstances hereinafter

described.

FACTUAL MATRIX

As stated by the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents in their Statement of Objections dated

6th December 2011, the facts and circumstances of the instant case take place in the

course of an investigation under the direction and instructions of the 5th Respondent,

founded on a complaint by an unknown party concerning several thefts which

occurred in the Moragahahena-Padduka area during the period preceding the events

of this case. As stated by the Respondents, the Petitioner was arrested on 17th

December 2010 on the reasonable suspicion that he was part of a thieving gang

connected to these thefts. However, upon the perusal of the evidence presented to

this Court by both parties, there appear to be several inconsistencies with the

Respondents narration of the incidents of this case, which I will address in the course

of this judgment. Thus, for the sake of clarity, I will first consider in brief the facts as

narrated by both the Petitioner and the Respondent separately as stated in the Petition

and Statement of Objections, respectively.

Facts as stated by the Petitioner

The Petitioner, who was at one time a soldier in the Sri Lankan Army, was discharged

from military service on or about 7th September 2009, and at the time of this

application was employed as a tinsmith and earned his living by doing motor vehicle

repair work. On or about 15th December 2010 at around 9:15 a.m. the Petitioner was

walking towards the garment junction in Madagala to get into a three-wheeler of a

friend named Chandana who was taking him to work at a house in Kahawala. At the

said junction, the Petitioner noticed a motorcycle with the 4th Respondent and

another. The Petitioner states that it was only after he was arrested in the manner

elucidated hereinafter that he came to realise this other person with the 4th

Respondent to be a police officer. The Petitioner got into the said three-wheeler and

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 60

proceeded towards Kahawala. A few minutes into the journey the Petitioner realized

that they were being surrounded on all 4 sides by motor bicycles and the three-

wheeler was forced to stop. The 1st Respondent together with another police officer

forced themselves into the back seat of the three-wheeler on either side of the

Petitioner. The 1st Respondent and the other police officer forcefully took custody of

the Petitioners mobile phone, threatening the Petitioner saying ,

[Dont struggle, will kill you].

The Petitioner was then taken to the Dambara Cemetery and was questioned by the

Respondents about one Chinthaka. The Petitioner stated that he did not know

anything of this person apart from the fact that he owned cattle and a bakery. Upon

giving this response, the Respondents started kicking the Petitioners thighs several

times till he was numb. Thereafter, 1st Respondent made a phone call to another, and

the Petitioner heard him say , [Sir, we caught]. Thereafter, as per the

instructions of this sir over the phone, the Respondents removed the Petitioners t-

shirt and blindfolded him with it.

About 15 minutes later, the Petitioner, still blindfolded, was dragged and put into a

van with his hands cuffed at the back, at which time there were several other Police

officers present. The 2nd Respondent questioned the Petitioner whether he had

retained his gun from the military, to which the Petitioner answered in the negative.

The 2nd Respondent had threatened the Petitioner that he would bury the Petitioner

alive in the cemetery, causing the Petitioner to fear for his life.

Thereafter the 2nd Respondent had asked the 1st Respondent to put Chillie powder into

two shopping bags and to tie it over the Petitioners head so as to compel him to

breathe in the Chillie powder. While the Petitioner was caused to choke and suffocate

by being compelled to inhale the Chillie powder, the Police officers had watched the

Petitioner and had only removed it when it seemed as though the Petitioner was about

to die. Once again, the Petitioner was questioned regarding the weapon and the

Petitioner had answered in the negative just as he had done before. The entire process

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 60

of torture by Chillie powder was continued repeatedly while the other Police officers

were striking the Petitioners cheeks until he was bleeding out of his mouth and

continued to beat him with what the Petitioner described as three-wheeler belts.

The Petitioner states that during this process of torture, the 2nd Respondent further

questioned the Petitioner about several other robberies he was purported to have

been involved in, with a specific focus on the robbery said to have occurred at the

house of the 4th Respondent whose house the Petitioner had overheard people say

had been broken into a few days ago. When the Petitioner said he knew nothing about

it, the entire process of torture continued. The Petitioner states that the torment came

to a point that he could not bear it anymore, and, in fear for his life, he falsely admitted

to robbing the said house of the 4th Respondent. In an attempt to be relieved of the

torture, the Petitioner had fabricated a false incident, that, a person named Chaminda

went into the house of the 4th Respondent while the Petitioner kept a lookout, and

another named Nimal was also involved. The Petitioner also falsely admitted that he

was given Rs.50,000 for having assisted in the robbery and that he did not know about

the balance of monies stolen.

Thereafter, the beating stopped, and the 1st and 2nd Respondents along with the other

Police Officers went to have a meal at the Hasthigiriya Hotel in Meepe taking the

Petitioner in the van along with them. The Petitioner was not given any food to eat.

The Petitioner was thereafter blindfolded and handcuffed, and taken to a place to

shower, and thereafter to a place which the Petitioner later learnt was the Mirihana

Police Station. The Petitioner was further questioned at the Police station by the 1st

and 2nd Respondents with the aim of getting an admission from the Petitioner as to

the robberies, to which he had previously admitted having succumbed to the torment

caused by the Respondents. This time, however, the Petitioner was informed that he

had 15 cases of Robbery against him in Padukka and was questioned further regarding

this. Having answered in the negative, the Petitioner was once again subject to torture

by way of Chillie powder as described above and additionally, two officers were

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 60

standing on his thighs and jumping until his legs were numb while continuing the

questioning. Unable to bear the pain and agony, the Petitioner had once again

succumbed to the pressure and had made various admissions, including that he had

broken into the co-operative store, removed the rubber from a lorry, stolen some gold

jewellery, broken into his brother-in-laws house and stolen the television, VCD player

and cassette player.

The Petitioner states that once all the admissions were written down by the 1st and 2nd

Respondents, the beatings ceased for a while. Thereafter, since the Petitioner had

indicated that he could show the purportedly stolen goods in his house, he was put

into a van and brought back to his house around 6:00 a.m. on or about 16th December

2010 by the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents and about four other Police Officers. The 2nd

Respondent thereafter went into the house and asked the Petitioner's wife whether

the television and the pendant worn by the Petitioner's child were stolen. The

Petitioner's wife responded that the said television had been purchased from Singer

Sri Lanka on an easy-pay scheme and showed the receipts. The 2nd Respondent further

inquired as to the whereabouts of the stolen gold jewellery, to which the

Petitioner responded that it was buried near the plantain trees. However, upon

searching the place the 1st and 2nd Respondents discovered that there were no such

goods. The 2nd Respondent asked the Petitioner as to why he had lied, to which the

Petitioner responded that he had no option but to lie because he was afraid, which

resulted in the 2nd Respondent and another Police Officer beating the Petitioner

mercilessly, subjecting him to such degrading treatment in front of the Petitioner's wife

and two children of ages 09 and 02 years respectively, traumatising his wife and

children so much so that his eldest daughter fainted upon witnessing her father

mistreated in such a manner.

The Petitioner states that one Police Officer began assaulting his legs and back with a

pole handed over by the 4th Respondent until the pole broke. The Petitioner was then

dragged into the kitchen and questioned again about the purported stolen goods.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 60

Since there were no such goods, the Petitioner was mercilessly assaulted over and over

again with another [club] until that, too, broke. The Petitioner states that

thereafter the said Police Officers began trampling his face since he had fallen on the

ground. The Petitioner states that at one point his wife and two children were taken to

one of the rooms and were not permitted to come out, to prevent them from shouting,

while the 1st and 2nd Respondents and other Police Officers continued to assault the

Petitioner.

Immediately thereafter, the Petitioner was taken in the van again to the Mirihana Police

Station. The Petitioner was taken to the top floor of the said Mirihana Police Station,

handcuffed and asked to sit on the floor beside the chair. The Petitioner then saw that

Chandana, the driver of the three-wheeler, was permitted to make a statement and to

leave thereafter. The Petitioner was thereafter taken to what appeared to be 'the

torture chambers' of the Mirihana Police Station, where he was assaulted mercilessly.

The Petitioner states that one of the Police Officers assaulted the Petitioner's thighs

with a pole till he was numb and fell. Thereafter a Police Officer began assaulting him

with a three-wheeler belt and then he was hung on a beam upside down with his legs

and kept suspended for a while. Eventually, when he was taken down, he was forced

to have a bath. The Petitioner states that thereafter he was taken upstairs again and

questioned by the 1st and 2nd Respondents as to details of the aforementioned Nimal

and Chaminda and one Jayasena also known to the Petitioner. Then one of the Police

Officers said that they, too, had been brought and that the Petitioner would see them

in the morning. The Petitioner states that on or about 17th December 2010, he was

taken to a place within the Mirihana Police Station, where the said Nimal, Chaminda

and Jayasena were. It was apparent that they too had been subjected to torture. The

Petitioner was questioned again about their involvement in the purported robbery of

the 4th Respondent's house, and he answered in the affirmative as he could not endure

being tortured anymore. However, the torture continued and all of them were beaten

mercilessly. The Petitioner states that thereafter he was taken upstairs, and one hand

and leg were cuffed together onto one leg of a table, as on several other occasions.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 60

The Petitioner further states that even though the Petitioner had explained to the

Consultant Judicial Medical Officer that he had been cuffed to a table, it had been

erroneously recorded as him having been cuffed to a bed, as demonstrated in the

Medico-Legal Report.

The Petitioner states that on or about 18th December 2010, he was taken down to the

said 'torture chambers' again where he saw the said Nimal suspended on a beam with

his hands. Then again, the Petitioner was questioned as to whether he was saying the

truth and the Petitioner at that point, said that he was compelled to fabricate it

previously, only because he was powerless to escape the torture and merely to gain

relief from the pain. Thereafter, on the same day, i.e., on or about 18th December 2010,

the Petitioner was hung by his hands and suspended on a beam, while the said Nimal

was taken down. During this time the Petitioner was questioned repeatedly regarding

all alleged cases and as he denied his involvement, the torture persisted. In a while,

the 1st and 2nd Respondents placed a chair on which the Petitioner was ordered to

stand and yet again answer the questions posed at him with the sole purpose of

manipulating him to secure an admission. However, the moment it was denied the

chair was pulled away, causing the Petitioner to remain suspended by his hands. The

Petitioner was left suspended in this manner for a while, causing him to suffer immense

pain. The Petitioner states that eventually, when he could not bear it anymore, he

admitted only to the robbery of the Co-operative Store and removing the rubber from

the lorry and he also said that only Nimal, Chaminda and he were involved and that

Jayasena was not. The Petitioner states that thereafter, the 2nd Respondent ordered

that he (and others) be taken down, made to bathe, given Panadol and eventually

given some food. The Petitioner states that even though he had been initially arrested

on or about 15th December 2010, until such time (on or about 18th December 2010)

he had not been given even a morsel of food. The Petitioner states that even then, the

torture did not stop as they were taken upstairs and all of them except for Jayasena

were beaten mercilessly with three-wheeler 'belts'. In fact, the Petitioner claims that he

was beaten with a three-wheeler belt by the 2" Respondent about 25-30

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 60

times until he was in unbearably excruciating pain. Thereafter, Nimal and Chaminda

were questioned as to what was stolen and where the goods were. Subsequently,

Nimal's wife brought an oven claiming that it was one of the 'stolen goods' and

thereafter eventually the beatings ceased and they were handcuffed.

The Petitioner states that he came to know that his wife, on coming to learn that he

was detained at the said Mirihana Police Station, had on several occasions come to the

Police Station, but was refused access on every such instance. In fact, on one such

occasion, when the Petitioner's wife was desperately searching for the Petitioner, she

was informed by one of the female Police Officers at the Mirihana Police Station that

the Petitioner was there but that she had been instructed not to grant access to him.

The Petitioner further states that on or about 19th December 2010, all of them were

confined to a cell and at around 6:40 p.m., were taken to the residence of the Acting

Magistrate of Awissawella to obtain a detention order for 48 hours under the pretext

of having to conduct further investigations. Accordingly, the detention was extended,

and the suspects were to be produced in Court at 9:00 a.m. on 21st December 2010.

The Petitioner however further states that the 2nd Respondent obtained such detention

order by stating that the Petitioner and others had been arrested only on 18th

December 2010.

The Petitioner further states that when the said Acting Magistrate questioned the

Petitioner as to whether any injuries were inflicted while in custody, the Petitioner had

said there had not been such. The Petitioner states that the reasoning for answering

in this manner despite all the torture he had undergone over the past days was due to

the fact that he feared for his life, being fully aware of the consequences he was likely

to face and what further suffering he would be made to endure by the Police while

being detained if he had informed the learned Acting Magistrate of the treatment

meted out to him by the Respondents. The Petitioner further states that in the

circumstances, the learned Acting Magistrate too, without any examination of the

Petitioner, recorded that there were no injuries, as borne out by the said record.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 60

The Petitioner states that he (and others) was not produced before the Court on 21st

December 2010, in contravention of the said detention order.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate, on 22nd December 2010 declared that such

detention was unlawful and ordered the Registrar of Court to call for a report from the

Deputy Inspector General - Nugegoda on the matter. The Petitioner states that later

that evening, they were produced before the learned Magistrate at which point, he

informed the learned Magistrate about the torture endured. Consequently, the

Petitioner was enlarged on personal bail of Rs. 50,000.00 and the learned Magistrate

ordered that he (and others) be given necessary medical attention and that the case

record be placed in the safe.

The Petitioner states that after his release, on or about 25th December 2010 the

Petitioner was admitted to the Matale Hospital as it was not safe for him to remain at

his residence. Thereafter, on or about 27th December 2010, he was examined by the

Consultant Judicial Medical Officer, Matale who concluded that the nature and pattern

of the injuries sustained by the Petitioner were consistent with the history given by him

and he was further referred to a Neurologist and a Physiologist for further examination.

The Petitioner states that he made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission on

or about 6th January 2011 concerning the aforesaid conduct and actions of the said

Respondents and/or other persons set out in this application involving torture,

inhuman and degrading treatment of the Petitioner and the infringement of the

Petitioner's fundamental rights as guaranteed under the Constitution. However, on or

about 10th March 2011 when the matter was taken up for Inquiry, the said 2nd

Respondent was not represented and therefore the Inquiry has been postponed

indefinitely.

The Petitioner states that on or about 28th January 2011 the Petitioner (as well as the

said Nimal, Chaminda and Jayasena) received notice to be present in the Horana

Magistrate's Court in respect of certain charge(s) against him. On such occasion, the

Petitioner was once again unlawfully remanded and refused bail purportedly on the

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 60

basis that there was a probability that he would continue to commit such offences if

released on bail, even though the Petitioner had never had charges against him except

the purported charges as elucidated above.

The learned Magistrate further ordered the Officer-in-Charge of the Moragahahena

Police Station to submit a report on the purported stolen goods. However, as

demonstrated by such report dated 11th February 2011, none of the charges against

the Petitioner could be sustained and the Petitioner was consequently released on bail.

Facts as stated by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents

The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents by their Joint Statement of Objections, in denying all

the averments of the Petition, stated that they were conducting investigations on the

instructions and directions of the 5th Respondent, acting on an anonymous public

complaint as to several thefts in the area, and that Petitioner and the 3 others were

suspected to be involved in these thefts as a gang. Respondents are of the position

that the arrest and taking into custody of the Petitioner and the subsequent detention

were during these investigations as per the instructions given by the 5th Respondent.

The Respondents also deny that the Petitioner was arrested on 15th December 2010

and state that he was arrested on 17th December 2010 with minimum force used only

because there was resistance on the part of the Petitioner. The Respondents further

hold the position that no injury or torture was caused to the Petitioner in the course

of the custody, which allegedly was from 17th to 22nd December 2010.

Facts as stated by the 3rd Respondent

In summarizing the Affidavit by the 3rd Respondent denying the averments of the

Petition, while the 3rd Respondent does affirm that he is the Head Quarters Inspector

of the Mirihana Police area, and that he is unaware as to the other building referred to

by the Petitioner where the torture had taken place. He also claims to be unaware of

the other circumstances of the instant application. While being generally unaware of

the torturous conduct which transpired according to the Petitioner, he affirms that no

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 60

such torture or injury was caused to the Petitioner by the Respondents, and thus states

that he cannot be held responsible for any of the aforementioned conduct.

Written Submissions on behalf of the 7th Respondents

The 7th Respondent makes an identical narration to that of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th

Respondents, and goes a step further in the Written Submissions filed on their behalf

to state that the Petitioner was arrested and investigated under and in accordance with

the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 15 of

2005, and have rightly obtained an order from the Magistrate to extend the period of

investigation accordingly, and thereby the Respondents are not in violation of the

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the

Constitution. At this instance, I wish to reiterate the fact that the events of the instant

case occurred within the period beginning from 15th December 2010 until 22nd

December 2010.

Affidavit of the 5th Respondent dated 05th October 2023

I wish to place on record that there was no Statement of Objections, nor any Written

Submissions filed by and on behalf of the 5th Respondent up until 26th September

2023, on which date the 5th Respondent had tendered an Affidavit, which did not

challenge much of the averments in the Petition dated 28th March 2011 nor the

Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner. The said Affidavit only makes reference to the fact

that the Respondents had sought permission from the learned Magistrate to further

detain the Petitioner and several other suspects for the purposes of further

investigations into a complaint made with regard to several incidents of thefts. The 5th

Respondent states that permission was sought and granted pursuant to section 2 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No.2 of 2013.

ANALYSIS

I wish to first place on record that the subject matter and the issues surrounding the

instant case do not concern the guilt of the Petitioner with regard to the criminal

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 60

allegations levelled against him. The instant case concerns only and is limited to

considering whether there has been a violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution, by the

Respondents for the manner in which they conducted themselves towards the

Petitioner.

Even the reconvicted criminals of the most notorious kind are entitled to their

fundamental rights. No number of allegations or even past convictions can abrogate

or limit ones fundamental rights except as permitted by the Constitution under Article

15. The presumption of innocence as enshrined within Article 13(5) of the Constitution,

being a cornerstone of the due process of law, must at all times be upheld by

investigating officers with the utmost conviction.

As such, needless to say, the allegations against the Petitioner, of which the

Respondents invited this Courts attention, matter only insofar as to determine

whether there is a reasonable suspicion or reasonable complaint against the Petitioner

in considering Article 13(1). Such allegations matter nought in respect of all other

fundamental rightsespecially Article 11, for torture, inhuman and degrading

treatment are absolutely abominable in law under all circumstances.

Article 13(1): Arrest

Article 13(1) of the Constitution provides as follows:

No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law.

Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.

This Article insists upon two fundamental requirements in making an arrest. Firstly, it

provides in no uncertain terms that an arrest may only be made according to

procedure established by law. Secondly, it further requires that a person be given

reasons for his arrest. Section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of

1979 once again insists upon this Constitutionally recognized requirement of giving

reasons for the arrest.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 60

Police officers are required to act strictly within the parameters of law in effecting

arrests. Here, the words according to procedure established by law means, of course,

according to the procedure set out in any specific written law established for the

purposes of regulating the manner in which an arrest can be made, and, primarily with

regard to the instant case, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979.

Before deciding whether there had been an illegal arrest, it is necessary to determine

whether there had, in fact, been an arrest.

It is well established in our law by cases such as Namasivayam v. Gunawardena

[1989] 1 Sri LR 394 and Piyasiri v. Fernando, ASP [1988] 1 Sri LR 173, that an arrest

can take place even without physical confinement. In the instant case, this question

does not trouble us as the Respondents themselves have not denied arresting the

Petitioner. The position held by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents was that they had

arrested and detained the Petitioner according to the provisions of the law using

minimum force. [Paras 5 and 6 of the Statement of Objections of 1st, 2nd, and 4th

Respondents dated 6th December 2011].

The procedure with regard to arresting a person without a warrant is set out in Chapter

IV B (Sections 32-43) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. Section 32

therein states as follows:

(1) Any peace officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant

arrest any person -

(a) who in his presence commits any breach of the peace;

(b) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a

reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been

received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned;

(c) having in his possession without lawful excuse (the burden of proving

which excuse shall He on such person) any implement of house-breaking;

(d) who has been proclaimed as an offender;

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 60

(e) in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected

to be property stolen or fraudulently obtained and who may reasonably

be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to such thing;

(f) who obstructs a peace officer while in the execution of his duty or who has

escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody;

(g) reasonably suspected of being a deserter from the Sri Lanka Army, Navy

or Air Force;

(h) found taking precautions to conceal his presence under circumstances

which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions with a

view to committing a cognizable offence;

(i) who has been concerned in or against whom a reasonable complaint has

been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable

suspicion exists of his having been concerned in any act committed at any

place out of Sri Lanka, which if committed in Sri Lanka would have been

punishable as an offence and for which he is under any law for: the time

being in force relating to extradition or to fugitive persons or otherwise

liable to be apprehended or detained in custody in Sri Lanka.

The Respondents insisted that there had been a reasonable complaint made and

reasonable suspicion against the Petitioner, placing reliance upon the letter dated 10th

October 2010, written by the villagers to the office of Deputy Inspector General, but

bearing the name of the 5th Respondent, Deshabandu Tennakoon as the recipient

who was, in fact, a Superintendent of Police at the time material, as per his own

admission by his Affidavit dated 05th October 2023 at paragraphs 1 and 5.

As held in Walahahangunawewa Dhammarathana Thero v. Sanjeewa Mahanama

SC FR 313/09, SC Minutes of 03.07.2013 at p. 89,

In order to arrest a person under this subsection [subsection (1) of section 32]

there should be a reasonable complaint, credible information or a reasonable

suspicion. Mere fact of receiving a complaint or information does not permit a

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 60

peace officer to arrest a person. Police Officer upon receipt of a complaint or

information is required to commence investigations and ascertain whether the

complaint is a reasonable complaint, the information is credible or the suspicion

is reasonable before proceeding to arrest a person. (Emphasis added)

In Channa Pieris v. Attorney-General [1994] 1 Sri LR 1 at p. 46, His Lordship

Amerasinghe J states as follows,

A reasonable suspicion may be based either upon matters within the officer's

knowledge or upon credible information furnished to him, or upon a combination

of both sources. He may inform himself either by personal investigation or by

adopting information supplied to him or by doing both, as the third respondent

suggests he did in the matters before us, and as it was the case in Ragunathan v.

Thuraisingham [SC Application 158/88 - SC Minutes of 23.08.89] A suspicion does

not become reasonable merely because the source of the information is

creditworthy. If he is activated by an unreliable informant, the officer making the

arrest should, as a matter of prudence, act with greater circumspection than if the

information had come from a creditworthy source. However, eventually the

question is whether in the circumstances, including the reliability of the sources

of information, the person making the arrest could, as a reasonable man, have

suspected that the persons were concerned in or committing or had committed

the offence in question

It was held by Kulatunga J in Gamlath v. Neville Silva and Others [1991] 2 Sri LR

267 at p. 274, citing Muttusamy v. Kannangara 52 NLR 324 at 327 that,

[A] suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was founded

on matters within the police officer's own knowledge or on the state-ments made

by other persons in a way which justify him giving them credit

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 60

Having referred to some of the aforementioned authorities, Aluwihare J in Ganeshan

Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and Others S.C (F/R) 405/2018, SC

Minutes of 20.09.2023 at p. 11 opined as follows:

Police officers cannot mechanically make an arrest upon a mere complaint

received, without forming the opinion that the allegation is credible. Thus, a police

officer is required to make necessary investigations, unless the facts are obvious,

to verify whether the complaint is credible or whether the information provided is

reliable. An arrest upon a general or vague suspicion would lead to significantly

abridging the personal liberties guaranteed to a person by the Constitution

However, if we were to stretch this logic irrationally, that could prove

counterproductive and pernicious towards the legitimate goals of the criminal justice

system. In this regard, Amerasinghe J in Channa Pieris v. Attorney-General [1994] 1

Sri LR 1 at p. 46 further explicated as follows:

the officer is not required to have reasonable grounds to believe. As Dias J.

pointed out in Buhary v. Jayaratne [(1947) 48 NLR 224] "believe" is much stronger

than "suspect" and involves the necessity of showing that a reasonable man must

have felt convinced in his mind of the fact in which he believed. (See per

Seneviratne J. in Withanachchi v. Cyril Herath and others [SC 144-45/86 - SC

Minutes 01.07.88]. However the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion

founded on mere conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to

a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an

offence for which he could have arrested a person without a warrant. The

suspicion must not be of an uncertain and vague nature but of a positive and

definite character providing reasonable ground for suspecting that the person

arrested was concerned in the commission of an offence.

It is to be noted that the aforementioned letter dated 10th October 2010 addressed by

name to the 5th Respondent marked Rx(1) is an anonymous letter. It is signed by the

aggrieved villagers/neighbours. As such, the credibility of the information contained

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 60

therein is most certainly questionable. The officers must in such instances be prudent

to conduct an investigation so as to confirm such information before acting on the

same. However, the Respondents have failed to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy

this Court that they had conducted an appropriate investigation prior to instigating

the arrest of the Petitioner.

It was most certainly reasonable for then Superintendent of Police, T.M.W.D.

Tennakoon, to direct an investigation with regards to the complaint so received, as it

is the duty of a police officer to duly respond to such complaints, even when they are

anonymous. However, once such an order or direction is made by a senior police

officer, as I shall discuss in detail later on, they are duty-bound to ensure that such

directions are properly carried out, with due regard to the procedure established by

law.

It appears in the instant case that the Respondents have failed to sufficiently

investigate the anonymous complaint made. I do not wish to state, by any means, that

police officers should refrain from acting on anonymous complaints, but rather that an

officer must take some steps to confirm the legitimacy of such complaints. While wide

powers are vested with police officers to carry out their investigations, when it comes

to any act which may impinge upon the individual liberties of a person, officers must

observe utmost caution. The officers in question could have, at the least, interviewed

some persons living in the area and recorded their statements so as to verify the

veracity of the allegations levelled against the Petitioner and several others by the

anonymous letter and the unnamed informant. However, no evidence has been

produced before this Court by the Respondents to establish that such actions have

been taken. Therefore, in my view, it cannot be said that the Respondents have acted

upon a reasonable complaint or upon reasonable suspicion as required by section 32

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 60

Informing the Reasons for Arrest

Apart from Article 13(1) itself, section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.

15 of 1979. Section 23(1) provides as follows:

In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch or confine

the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to the custody

by word or action and shall inform the person to be arrested of the nature of the

charge or allegation upon which he is arrested.

As Sharvananda J, as His Lordship was then, stated in Mariadas Raj v. Attorney-

General FRD(2) 397 at pp. 402-404,

The law is solicitous for the freedom of the individual and has therefore enacted

that the person who is arrested is entitled to know the reason for his arrest and

has elevated this right into a fundamental right with the attendant sanctions for

its breach Article 13(1) embodies a rule which has always been regarded as vital

and fundamental for safeguarding the personal liberty in all legal systems where

the Rule of Law prevails The purpose of this rule is to afford the earliest

opportunity to the arrested person to remove any mistake, misapprehension or

misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting official and disabuse his mind of

the suspicion which actuated the arrest.

I unreservedly echo this astute observation of His Lordship. As apparent from the

rationale so set out, the requirement of informing the reasons for ones arrest also

marks a vital step in the investigation process. Even where an officer arrests the correct

person, who is subsequently convicted by a court of law, if such person is not informed

of the reason for his arrest at the time of arrest, that amounts to a violation of Article

13(1) of the Constitution, without prejudice to such conviction. Misidentifications are

common enough that it is vital for law enforcement authorities to afford any person

being arrested an opportunity to explain themselves.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 60

In the instant case, as stated by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents in their joint Statement

of Objections dated 06th December 2011, the Petitioner and 3 others were arrested by

the 2nd Respondent [para 6] while the Respondents were on police patrol, pursuant to

the investigation which commenced under the order and instructions of the 5th

Respondent [para 4].

As relayed by the Petitioner, the 1st and 2nd Respondents, while the three-wheeler was

in motion, forced themselves into the same three-wheeler in which the Petitioner was

travelling compelling the driver to take them to the cemetery, where the first acts of

torture were recorded and was continuously questioned and compelled to admit to

having committed or been associated with the several thefts in the area, particularly

the theft of the house of the 4th Respondent. The law requires police officers to inform

a person being arrested of the reason for the arrest with such precision so as to enable

the arrestee to offer an explanation. There is no indication of such reasons being

provided to the Petitioner as the three-wheel driver was compelled to drive towards

the cemetery.

For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that there has been a violation of the

Petitioners fundamental rights as guaranteed under Article 13(1).

13(2): Subsequent Detention and Production Before Magistrate

To address the question as to whether the Petitioner has been produced before a

Magistrate within the legally prescribed time period, it is vital to determine the exact

time of arrest. The version of events submitted by the Petitioner and the Respondents

greatly differed in this regard.

Irregularities as to the date of arrest

The Petitioner states in his Petition that he was taken to the Dambara Cemetery where

the chain of torturous acts began, as narrated by the Petition dated 15th December

2010. However, all Respondents, particularly the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents by their

Statement of Objections and Written Submissions and the 5th Respondent by his

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 60

Affidavit dated 05th October 2023, strongly held the position that the arrest was in fact

made on 17th December 2010. The only evidence presented by the Respondents to

substantiate this position is the copies of the

submitted as part and parcel of

the Statement of Objections, marked Rx(2).

However, I wish to place on record that, having perused the said true copies of the

purported Information Book submitted by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents marked

Rx(2), it is observable that the arrest of the Petitioner was, in fact, recorded to have

been made on 18th December 2010, and not on 17th December 2010 as claimed in the

Statement of Objections of the Respondents. This in itself is sufficient to construe that

there are irregularities in the Respondents narration of the facts and circumstances of

the instant case, significantly weakening their position.

Per contra, the Petitioner relied on the affidavits of several other persons to

substantiate his position, which provided this Court with a broader picture of what had

transpired.

Accordingly, reproduced below [verbatim for accuracy] are several of the averments in

the Affidavit of the Patrick Aarachchige Nimal Perera (hereinafter referred to as Nimal

Perera), produced marked P12, annexed to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner,

which concern the factual matrix of the instant case, along with an approximate

translation of each averment. Nimal Perera was another who was subjected to torture

along with the Petitioner during the period in question and was a party previously

known to the Petitioner.

[3. I state that on 2010.12.15 around 9:00-10:00 p.m. I received a phone call from

one Ranjith Sumangala, stating that he had a little too much to drink and had

fallen down in the Rubber estate. I was asked to come and take him home.

However, I noticed that the voice was not that of the said Ranjith, and therefore I

called my friends at the three-wheel park informed them of this.]

[4. I state, thereafter what they said was that they were at the police station at

that point, Ranjith and Chandana were missing, and have come to file a

complaint about it. I was told to wait for a while and that they would come to the

rubber estate to see who is there. After that, I went to the rubber estate with my

friends of Three-wheel Park, and no one was there, and after that I went home

and slept.]

Upon Nimal Perera informing his friends at the three-wheel park, the same informed

Nimal Perera that they were down at the Police station to file a complaint, as the said

Ranjith and one Chandana were missingChandana being the driver of the three-

wheel which the Petitioner had travelled in the same morning. The friends at the three-

wheel park informed Nimal Perera that they would come to Rubber Estate in a short

while. When they had arrived at the Rubber estate, there was no one to be found.

Nimal Perera had gone home afterwards.

Varusha Hannedige Suwinitha Kumari (hereinafter referred to as Suwinitha Kumari),

the wife of the Petitioner, in her Affidavit dated 25th March 2011, produced marked

Furthermore, Devanarayanage Rathna Deshapriya (hereinafter referred to as Rathna

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 27 of 60

The Petitioner had also mentioned at his medical examination by the Judicial Medical

Officer on 27th December 2010, that he was taken into custody on 15th December 2010,

and was subjected to torture since then. The Judicial Medical Officer concludes in his

report that the injuries are consistent with this history narrated by the Petitioner.

Therefore, having considered the totality of the above evidence presented by both

Parties, the affidavits of the Petitioner which corroborate the fact that the Petitioner

was taken in by the Police on 15th December 2010, and the irregularities in the

excerpts

submitted by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents, it can be concluded that the Petitioner

was, in fact, taken into custody by the Police on 15th December 2010, and was thus in

police custody up until 22nd December 2010, on which date he was presented before

the Avissawella Magistrate.

Code of Criminal Procedure, Act Nos. 15 of 2005 and 42 of 2007

In this regard, it is also necessary to duly appraise the position taken by the

Respondents in defence.

Article 13(2) states that [e]very Person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived

of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court

according to procedure established by law and shall not be further held in custody,

detained or deprived or personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such

judge made in accordance with procedure established by law.

Sections 36, 37 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 deal with

the detention of persons arrested without a warrant.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 60

Section 36 states that,

A peace officer making an arrest without warrant shall without unnecessary

delay and subject to the provisions herein contained as to bail take or send the

person arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case.

[Emphasis added]

Section 37 provides that,

Any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person

arrested without a warrant for a longer period than under all the

circumstances of the case is reasonable, and such period shall not exceed

twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place

of arrest to the Magistrate.

[Emphasis added]

The core issue of law which arises in the instant case is what was raised in the Written

Submissions of the Attorney-General on behalf of the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents, and

by the 5th Respondent in his Affidavit tendered on 27th September 2023.

The position thus held by Respondents is that the act of arresting the Petitioner was

done pursuant to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 2005, particularly

section 2 which provides as follows:

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.

15 of 1979 other than the provisions of section 43(A) of that Act, any peace officer

shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested without a

warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is

reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty - four hours exclusive

of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the

Magistrate:

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 60

Provided that where the arrest is in relation to an offence as is specified in the

Schedule to this Act, such period of detention in police custody may, on production

before him of the person arrested and on a certificate filed by a police officer not

below the rank of the Assistant Superintendent of Police submitted prior to the

expiration of the said period of twenty - four hours, to the effect that it is necessary

to detain such person for the purpose of further investigations, be extended upon

an order made in that behalf by the Magistrate for a further period not

exceeding twenty - four hours, so however that the aggregate period of

detention shall not exceed forty-eight hours.

[Emphasis added]

As mentioned previously, the Respondents state that the Petitioner was arrested in the

course of a purported investigation into the thefts in the Moragahahena-Padukka area,

and such investigations were under the order and instructions of the 5th Respondent,

and accordingly, the Respondents contend that the Petitioner was taken into custody

in compliance with the abovementioned provisions.

Before considering whether the above provisions have been complied with, I wish to

place on record that the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 2005 which came

into effect from 31st May 2005, by virtue of section 7 provides for the time frame within

which the Act would be effective as follows.

The provisions of this Act shall be in operation for a period of two years from

the date of its coming into operation.

[Emphasis added]

Thus, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 2005 remained valid only until 31st

May 2007, unless further extended by any preceding written law or Gazette

Extraordinary under the Order of the Minister of Justice. Accordingly, the duration was

further extended by another two years by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment)

Act, No. 42 of 2007 which came into effect on 09th October 2007, by virtue of section

7(1) read along with section 8 of the said Act, as provided below.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 60

7. (1) The provisions of this Act shall be in operation for a period of two years

commencing from the thirty-first day of May, 2007.

8. Any act or thing done for which enabling provision is made under this Act,

during the period commencing on the thirty-first day of May, 2007 and ending

on the date of the coming into operation of this Act, shall be deemed to have been

done validly.

[Emphasis added]

Thus, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, No. 42 of 2007 was to remain

valid only until 31st May 2009, unless further extended by any preceding written law or

Gazette Extraordinary under the Order of the then Minister of Justice. Thereafter, it was

not renewed nor extended up until the events of the instant case transpired which was

on 15th December 2010. During this period, there was no such Act in operation which

would validate the acts done during 15th-22nd December.

The next extension was done by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1708/5 - 30th May 2011,

which further extended the duration of application of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(Amendment) Act, No. 42 of 2007 to a further period of two years, commencing from

31st May 2011. Thereafter, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No.

02 of 2013 came into effect from 06th February 2013, which provided for an amended

provision under section 2, as follows.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.

15 of 1979 other than the provisions of section 43 A of that Act, any peace officer

shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested without a

warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is

reasonable and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the

time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the presence of the

Magistrate:

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 60

Provided that, where the arrest is in relation to an offence as is specified in the

Schedule to this Act, such period of detention in police custody may, on production

before him of the person arrested and on a certificate filed by a police officer not

below the rank of the Assistant Superintendent of Police submitted prior to the

expiration of the said period of twenty-four hours, to the effect that it is necessary

to detain such person for the purpose of further investigations, be extended upon

an Order made in that behalf by the Magistrate for a further period not

exceeding twenty-four hours, so however that the aggregate period of

detention shall not exceed forty-eight hours:

Provided further, that any person arrested and detained for a further period

shall be afforded an opportunity to consult an Attorney-at-Law of his choice

and to communicate with any relative or friend of his choice during the

period of such detention.

[Emphasis added]

However, the law as it stands today under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special

Provisions) Act No. 02 of 2013, section 8 provides as follows.

8. Where during the period commencing on May 31, 2009 and ending on the

date of the coming into operation of this Act, any power, duty or function was

exercised, performed or discharged by any person to whom such power, duty or

function was assigned by or under Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 42 of 2007, such power, duty or function which was so exercised, performed

or discharged, shall, notwithstanding that the provisions of the said Criminal

Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 42 of 2007 was not in operation during

the that period, be deemed to have been validly exercised, performed or

discharged, as if the said Act was in operation during such period:

The effect of the above provision is to retrospectively give effect to any acts between

31st May 2009 to 6th February 2013, despite there not being any express written law to

extend the time duration at the time in suit in the instant case. The 5th Respondent by

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 32 of 60

his Affidavit tendered on 27th September 2023, relies on the aforementioned

provisions to justify the detention of the Petitioner from 15th to 22nd December 2010,

or, as was fabricated by the Respondents, from 17th to 22nd December 2010. This Court

accepts that the Respondents have relied upon the correct legal provisions, but they

have failed in its application in the instant case. Regardless of whichever date the arrest

was made on, by virtue of section 2, no person can be detained in the custody of the

police without being presented before the Magistrate for a time duration exceeding

24 hours.

In the instant case, the first time in which the Petitioner and the 3 others tortured and

kept in custody were presented before the Acting Magistrate was on 19th December

2010 which was well over the 24-hour time limit. It was thereafter that a further

extension was granted by the Acting Magistrate, to another 48 hours, during which

period the Petitioner was not allowed to consult an Attorney, nor was he allowed to

communicate with his wife and friends who had arrived at the Mirihana Police station

but were denied access to him. This is a clear violation of the procedure set out above.

As such, it is palpably clear that the Petitioner has not been produced before the

Magistrate as required by law. Therefore, I find that the Petitioners fundamental rights

under Article 13(2) of the Constitution have also been violated by the conduct of the

Respondents.

Article 11: Torture, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment

Article 11 of the Constitution provides that,

No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment.

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 3 of the European Convention on

Human Rights similarly prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment in virtually identical terms.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 33 of 60

Amerasinghe J, in W.M.K. De Silva V. Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation

(1989) 2 SLR 393 at p. 405, explains the ambit of Article 11 of the Constitution as

follows:

"In my view Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits any act by which severe

pain or suffering, whether physical or mental is, without lawful sanction in

accordance with a procedure established by law, intentionally inflicted on a

person (whom I shall refer to as the victim) by a public official acting in the

discharge of his executive or administrative duties or under colour of office,

for such purposes as obtaining from the victim or a third person a confession

or information, such information being actually or supposedly required for

official purposes, imposing a penalty upon the victim for an offence or

breach of a rule he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having

committed, or intimidating or coercing the victim or a third person to do or

refrain from doing something which the official concerned believes the

victim or the third per son ought to do or refrain from doing, as the case

may be."

This is in line with Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other

Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to which Sri L is a State Party

since 1994. Accordingly, Article 1 provides for the definition of Torture as follows:

"torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether

physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes

as obtaining from him or a third person information or a

confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has

committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or

coercing him or a third person, or any reason based on discrimination of

any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation

of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 34 of 60

acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising

only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.

[Emphasis added]

Atukorale J, in Amal Sudath Silva v. Kodituwakku Inspector of Police and Others

(1987) 2 SLR 119 at p. 126, observing the universality of this right, states,

Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no person shall be subjected

to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It

prohibits every person from inflicting torture some, cruel or inhuman

treatment on another. It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no

restrictions or limitations whatsoever. Every person in this country, be

he a criminal or not, is entitled to this right to the fullest content of

its guarantee. Constitutional safeguards are generally directed against the

State and its organs. The police force being an organ of the State is enjoined

by the Constitution to secure and advance this right and not to deny, abridge

or restrict the same in any manner and under any circumstances. Just as

much as this right is enjoyed by every member of the police force, so is he

prohibited from denying the same to others, irrespective of their standing,

their beliefs or antecedents. It is therefore the duty of this court to protect

and defend this right jealously to its, fullest measure with a view to ensuring

that this right which is declared and intended to be fundamental is always

kept fundamental and that the executive by its action does not reduce it to

a mere illusion.

[emphasis added]

As has clearly been set out by His Lordship, this right is one which applies universally,

without restrictions, to all persons, from saints to the most notorious. Article 11

encapsulates one of the most basic elements of human dignity, the principle which

underpins all fundamental rights. As there can never be a justification for torture, this

Court is only troubled with deciding whether the Petitioner has been subjected to such

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 35 of 60

treatment which can be construed as torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading as

contemplated in Article 11 by the Respondents.

In making these decisions, the evidence presented by the Petitioner must be

considered in light of other corroborative evidenceprimarily the medical reports

assessing the physical and mental well-being of the Petitioner after the incident in

question.

To summarize what has been provided in the factual matrix above, the Petitioner

provides within the averments of the Petition dated 28th March 2011 a detailed

description of the physical harm caused by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents, primarily

having hit him on several occasions with three-wheeler belts, handcuffed and tied to

beams, suffocating him, beaten him physically, and having tied a bag of chilli powder

over the Petitioners head and compelling him to inhale it.

In his Medico-Legal Report of the Petitioner, Dr. Ajith Jayasena, Judicial Medical Officer,

of the District General Hospital, Matale, makes note under Section 2.1 of the said

Report of the Injuries identified having examined the Petitioner on 27th December 2010

which was a few days after the incident in question. Accordingly, the JMO makes note

of several healing abrasions along the back of the Petitioners neck and chest, and

across his arms, and of several resolving contusions on the Petitioner's arm, back of

his chest and abdomen. The report concludes that the injuries identified are consistent

with the medical history as narrated by the Petitioner, and special attention was drawn

to the injuries noted under section 2.1 No. 11 and 13 which are consistent with the

Petitioner being suspended with a ligature at wrist joint. This medical report most

certainly corroborates the averments as to the torturous acts committed against the

Petitioner.

Furthermore, the said report concludes that the injuries identified in the medical

examination are clearly consistent with the history given by the Petitioner. The

Petitioner has further been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

with depressive features, having left ulnar claw with both ulnar and median nerve

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 36 of 60

damage, suffering from injury to spinal nerves and has restricted movement of the

neck and also the possibility of left-side mild ulnar nerve lesion without gross axonal

degeneration and neuropraxia, all of which clearly indicate the gravity of the

injuries suffered by the Petitioner at the hands of the said Respondents as complained

of through this application.

Once again, I wish to place emphasis on the Affidavit of Nimal Perera, marked P12,

annexed to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner, which also establishes the torture

endured by the Petitioner and other 3 detainees in the hands of the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th

Respondents. Nimal Perera was taken in by the Police on 16th December 2010. The said

affidavit states as follows:

[15. I state that the next morning, that is, on the morning of 17.12.2010, I was

taken to an old building located behind the said building. Inside of the said

builing, there was a ground. There were concrete rooms around the ground. There

were about 6-7 police officers. They strung a rafter between the windows and

the door and stripped me naked and suspended me. My younger brother,

Ranjith and Nishantha were there. There was a rubber hose, a three-wheel rubber

band and also a stick.]

this earlier, there are 21 cases, admit them without getting beaten. I said I don't

know anything. Then the other 6 officers who were there, thrashed me with a

three-wheel rubber band. While thrashing, they kept asking to admit. I said that

if Ranjith had told them anything, he must have gone and that I don't know. Then

Officer namely, Bhathiya Jayasinghe asked to tell the truth without getting

beaten]

suspended.]

around 4:00 in the evening.]

Bandara, and another well-built officer who had a fair complexion and was about

25 to 30 years old took videos with two camera phones. I state that the officer

namely, Bandara sent such videos to his girlfriend. Upon seeing the videos, she

said on the phone, "What a pity, what are you doing?" and then he responded by

asking what was pity.]

[21. I state that, after that, I was taken down and all four were asked to exercise

and run around naked. Thereafter, we were asked to take a bath. I said that I

couldn't, and it would kill me. Then he said. If you don't bathe, we will forcefully

bathe you. Then they took us to the water tank and asked us to take a bath. we

bathed with much difficulty. I do state that Ranjith told him that he could not lift

the water from his hands, then we bathed him and they brought us back to the

ground and ordered us to dry our clothes.

[22. I state that, after drying the clothes, we were taken back to the previously

said building. Thereafter, we were handcuffed and they made us sit under the

tables. We were not given anything to eat or drink that day. Each received a

panadol tablet. We stayed under the table that night too. While we were there, a

higher-ranked police officer came to the place where we were. He asked those

officers who we were, and then those officers said, Sir, these are the fellows of

the Sergeant Major's case. There is a cattle thief too among them..]

genitals. We applied it with difficulty. He repeatedly thrashed us when we were in

pain with smarting.]

stating that he would be back again. Then an officer who was there said that he

was not the type of officer who usually hits people, but he too thrashed us due to

our ill fate. I came to know later that the said police officer was Superintendent

of Police Deshabandhu Tennakoon.]

us again and again and they beat us in turns and brought us back to the building

where we were kept at night and placed us on the tables and handcuffed us.]

to the rear balcony of the building where we were being held and detained there

until the evening and six officers including Bandara and Dissanayake repeatedly

attacked with an iron rod. While there were attacking, they also threw chilli

powder at our faces. While they were doing so, they asked where is the money

that was looted from the house of Wanasundara. We said that we didnt loot. At

all the times we said no, they repeatedly assaulted us. They made us all sit down

under the hot sun until evening 5.00. We learned from the conversation of the

police officers there that a senior official was coming to that building that day.

We were kept in this secure location so as to prevent the higher ranked official

from seeing it.]

inside]

Jayasinghe, and Thennakoon]

Furthermore, the Petition of the Petitioner states that he was taken back to his house

at one point during his detention looking for the goods he was alleged to have stolen.

At this point, he further states that he was beaten in front of his family mercilessly, so

much so that it caused his eldest daughter to faint, out of sheer agony, unable to

witness her father being treated in such a cruel manner.

The affidavit of Petitioners wife, Suwinitha Kumari, produced marked P3 attached to

the Petition of the Petitioner states, in this regard, as follows:

handcuffed behind his back. His face was swollen to the point of being

conscious.]

[11. Thereafter, they dragged my husband into the kitchen to look for the alleged

stolen goods, and since they couldnt find anything, they took a wooden bar used

for the kitchen door and beat my husband commanding him to answer them.

that moment]

[12. At this moment, I and my children started screaming seeing the manner in

which my husband was being beaten, and my eldest daughter fainted at the sight

of her tortured father. To prevent us from further screaming, they locked us three

with my husband at that time. Therefore, I went to the Avissawella Court. Yet, the

husband was not brought to the court until 2.00 p.m. which made us go to the

Mirihana police again. I also state that the husband was in the cells at that time.]

[I state that the husband was brutally beaten. His face & limbs were swollen red.

way.]

[Emphasis added]

However high the threshold of proving torture may be, the Respondents in the instant

case have unfortunately cleared it with much ease. The instant case is a glowing

testimony as to the almost prophetic prudence of Sir Fitzjames Stephen in making

admissions made to a police officer inadmissible when drawing the Indian Evidence

Actwhich we went on to adopt in our own Evidence Ordinance.

In view of the aforementioned, it is clear that the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents have

all been directly associated with the torturing of the Petitioner. What the Petitioner has

had to endure, without a shred of doubt, amounts to torture as contemplated under

Article 11 of the Constitution. Furthermore, the narration of the incidents of torture by

Nimal Perera as noted above is consistent with the narration as provided by the

Petitioner. Thus, this Court concludes that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents have

violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner as enshrined under Article 11 of the

Constitution.

Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides that [a]ll persons are equal before the law

and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution serves as an umbrella provision which governs the

fundamental right to equality, against class discrimination of persons, and to uphold

equality in the application of law. Within Article 12(1) of the Constitution is enshrined

the doctrine of Rule of Law, thereby affording equal protection before the law to all

persons. Above all, Article 12(1) of the Constitution further embraces the all-important

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 48 of 60

notion of human dignity, the golden thread running through the fabric of fundamental

rights.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution stands an absolute bar against arbitrariness for it

imposes a duty on all public officials regardless of their rank to uphold the law and

only exercise the powers as have been vested upon them by law, thus establishing the

supremacy of law above all other considerations. Public Officialswhich most certainly

includes police officerscannot adopt a practice of selective application of laws, nor

can there be arbitrary decisions, assuming the role of judge, jury and executioner.

In the instant case, the Respondents are of the position the arrests and detention were

made under the direction and instructions of the 5th Respondents during an

investigation regarding several thefts in the area acting on a complaint made by an

unknown party to the 5th Respondent. In the Written Submissions of the Attorney

General dated 26th September 2023 and the Affidavit of the 5th Respondent dated 05th

October 2023, it was contended that the arrests and detention were lawful under

section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2013. The

Respondents further contended the arrests to be in accordance with the procedures

set out by law and that minimum force was used on the Petitioner during the arrests.

The question here is by no means the amount of force used at the time of effecting

the arrest. As has been discussed above, the Petitioner was arrested and detained

without a warrant and held and tortured in custody for more than 24 hours. There is

an absolute and non-derogable prohibition against torture in all circumstances, even

during times of armed conflict or states of emergency, for it is a sign of absolute

lawlessness.

The arrestees, including the Petitioner, were only presented before the Magistrate to

extend the period of custody for the purposes of the so-called investigations on 19th

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 49 of 60

December 2010, by which date 4 days had already passed. This, as established, is

absolutely obnoxious to the special provisions the Respondents themselves relied on.

Persons in detention, regardless of the charges or accusations against them, are

entitled to the fullest protection of their human dignity and physical integrity. State

institutions and those who serve the State are sternly reminded of their obligation to

ensure that persons in detention are treated not only within the bounds of legality but

with an uncompromising adherence to the principles of humanity. This stance is not

only a legal mandate, but also a relentless moral imperative.

The manner in which the 1st, 2nd and 5th Respondents, being officers of the law, have

conducted themselves, in concert with the 4th Respondent, is a stark betrayal of the

Rule of Law. They have acted in a manner entirely repugnant to the virtues of a

democratic republic.

In these circumstances, I have no qualm holding the treatment the Petitioner had

undergone to be a gross violation of his fundamental rights recognised under Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

CONCLUSION OF THE COURT

Considering the inconsistencies in the Respondents version of events and the fact that

the Petitioners version of events is corroborated by the Medical Report issued by the

Judicial Medical Officer of the District General Hospital of Matale as well as the

affidavits of those who were detained and tortured with him, this Court is left with no

other option but to reject the position of the Respondents in toto and accept the

Petitioners version of events as true.

The Petitioners fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) have been

blatantly violated by the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents. The kind of conduct on

display, judged even by the lowest of standards, amounts to a magnificent failure of

all that the Rule of Law stands for.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 50 of 60

This Court has time and time again made pronouncements setting out guiding

principles as to how law enforcement officers must act. But all such attempts continue

to fall on deaf ears. Violations of the kind we have observed in this case are,

unfortunately, all too common. These are by no means isolated one-off events but are

symptoms of longstanding institutional failures. When the Evidence Ordinance was

first enacted in 1895, police officers were deemed too unreliable to make confessions

made before them admissible. Lamentably, after well over a dozen decades, nought

has changed.

In the words of Aluwihare J., as expressed in Mohammed Rashid Fathima Sharmila

v. K.W.G. Nishantha SC. FR Application, No. 398/2008, SCM of 03rd February

2023, the matters are disturbing, to say the least. His Lordship further expressed

concerns therein vis--vis the modus operandi of Sri Lanka Police:

Sri Lanka Police established in 1806, has a history of over two centuries and

one would expect it to develop into a body that comprises of professional law

enforcement personnel. I am at a loss to understand, in the present day and time

as to why such an established law enforcement entity is incapable of affording

due protection to a citizen who is in their custody. Unfortunately, it is not rare to

hear instances of suspects dying in the hands of the police. It only highlights the

utterly unprofessional approach to duty by the personnel who man it and as a

consequence, people are increasingly losing trust in the police. It had lost the

credibility it ought to enjoy as a law enforcement agency. The incident relevant

to this application had taken place in 2008, however, this court observes that

instances of death of suspects in police custody are continuing to happen, even

today. It appears that the hierarchy of the administration had paid scant attention

to arrest this trend which does not augur well for the law enforcement and the

rule of law.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 51 of 60

Having expressed these worries, his Lordship directed the Inspector General of Police

to formulate, issue and implement guidelines to the police elaborating as to how the

standards may be improved.

Years prior to these observations, in Landage Ishara Anjali (Minor) v. Waruni

Bogahawatte, SC (FR) Application No. 677/2012, SCM of 12.06.2019 Aluwihare J.

has similarly raised concerns with regards to the growing number of incidents of abuse

of power. There, too, the Inspector General of Police was directed to issue guidelines

regarding the same. In addition to such direction, his Lordship has further postulated

guiding principles to be included in any such guidelines to be issued.

Following the directions of His Lordship in Mohammed Rashid Fathima Sharmila v.

K.W.G. Nishantha (supra), the Inspector General of Police has issued IGP Circular

2747/2023 dated 25th March 2023. While this circular has specifically referred to this

case, I cannot help but notice that it has not sufficiently encompassed the guiding

principles Aluwihare J. postulated in Landage Ishara Anjali (Minor) v. Waruni

Bogahawatte (supra). In particular, the elements concerning human dignity, non-

discrimination, proportionality and rights of children.

As such, we direct the National Police Commission and the relevant authorities to give

due recognition to these principles in formulating any future guidelines. Moreover, we

direct the National Police Commission to see to it that these guidelinesincluding

Circular 2747/2023 and the principles I have noted it to have omittedare properly

implemented and are integrated into the training of police officers.

LIABILITY OF THE RESPONDENTS

The 3rd Respondent, Madiwaka Adikari Mudiyanselage Egodawele Wallauwe Senerath

Adikari Egodawele, the Head Quarters Inspector, Mirihana Police Station, at the time

material to this case, by his Affidavit dated 5th October 2011, averred that the conduct

in question did not take place under his direct supervision. In view of the facts

disclosed therein, the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner informed this Court on 11th

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 52 of 60

October 2017 that he does not intend to pursue any relief against the 3rd Respondent.

Considering this, I make no pronouncements against the 3rd Respondent [Journal Entry

dated 11.10.2017].

1st and 2nd Respondents

It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have

played a central role in the fundamental rights violations in the instant case. Upon

perusal of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is apparent that most of

the torture was in fact carried out by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, and it was they who

had abducted the Petitioner on 15th December 2010 and took the Petitioner to the

Cemetery.

The Petition of the Petitioner explains, in great detail, the role played by the 1st, 2nd

and 4th Respondents in the violations in question. The Petition of the Petitioner very

clearly claims the 1st and 2nd Respondents to have been instrumental in the arrest and

the subsequent prolonged torture of the Petitioner.

Corroborating the same, the Affidavit of Chaminda Nishan, produced marked P10

attached to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner, specifically mentions officers

Bandara (1st Respondent) and Bhathiya Jayasinghe (2nd Respondent) to have tortured

the arrestees by various means.

Further corroborating, the Affidavit of Nimal Perera, produced marked P12 attached

to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner, explicates how the officers Bandara and

Bhathiya Jayasinghe tortured them in numerous despicably imaginative ways.

The Petition of the Petitioner also avers that he was tortured at his own home in front

of his family, to such a grave extent that his elder daughter fainted at the sight of it.

Affidavit of the Petitioners wife dated 25th March 2011, produced marked P2 attached

to the Petition, corroborates the acts of torture that took place at the Petitioners

home.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 53 of 60

The 1st and 2nd Respondents themselves have not rejected their involvement in

effecting the arrest, but rather argue the arrest to have been carried out according to

the procedure established by law. All that they have produced in support are the

documents marked Rx(1), Rx(2) and Rx(2). Said documents are titled

. I am not able to provide a proper translation of the

same as this purported

is not an Information Book that is generally in use. Given the

incongruities found between the aforementioned documents and the Respondents

own averments, this Court cannot attribute any probative value to the same. As such,

the 1st and 2nd Respondents are no doubt liable for the violations of Articles 13(1) and

13(2) morefully dealt with earlier in the judgement.

In response to these clear and grave allegations set out in the aforementioned

averments with regards to Articles 11 and 12, the 1st and 2nd Respondents, in their joint

Objections with the 4th Respondent dated 06th December 2011 and their Written

Submissions dated 19th November 2013, have merely offered a simple denial of the

contents therein.

However, the Medico-Legal Report of the Petitioner issued by the Consultant Judicial

Medical Officer of the District General Hospital, Matale strongly corroborates the

version of events set out before this Court by the Petitioner. The history given by the

Petitioner to the Judicial Medical Officer reflects what he has averred before this Court

and the Judicial Medical Officer concludes and opines the history so given to be

consistent with the 16 different injuries recorded in the Medico Legal Report.

The position of the 1st, 2nd [and the 4th Respondent, as the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents

have filed joint Objections and Written Submissions] with regards to the Medico-Legal

Report is to simply claim the injuries therein to be non-corroborative of the history

recorded.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 54 of 60

Such a simple and feeble denial cannot, by any means, displace an expert opinion. As

such I have no qualm holding the 1st and 2nd Respondents liable for the violation of

Petitioners fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2).

4th Respondent

With regards to the 4th Respondent, Petition of the Petitioner as well as the

aforementioned Affidavits marked P2 [at para 6], P10 [at para 13] and P12 [at para

13] confirm the participation of the 4th Respondent in the conduct in question. In this

regard, it is pertinent to note that the 4th Respondent is not a police officer, and

moreover, he had not denied the contents of the aforementioned affidavits.

However, in the joint Written Submissions dated 06th December 2011, it was

contended that his actions do not amount to executive and administrative action on

account of the fact that he is not a public officer. At the very outset, I wish to note that

this contention has no bearing on this Courts jurisdiction, as several other public

officers are involved in the violations in question. Furthermore, as held in Faiz v.

Attorney-General and Others [1995] 1 Sri L.R. 372, whether an act is executive

and/or administrative is not conclusively dependent upon the colour of the actors

office. In appropriate cases, even the acts of a private individual may amount to

executive and administrative action.

In Faiz v. Attorney-General (Supra) at p. 383, His Lordship Mark Fernando J held as

follows:

Article 126, speaks of an infringement by executive of administrative action; it

does not impose a further requirement this action must be by an executive officer.

It follows at the act of a private individual would render him liable, if in the

circumstances that act is "executive or administrative". The act of a private

individual would be executive if such act is done with the authority of the

executive such authority; transforms an otherwise purely private act into executive

or administrative action; such authority may be express, or implied from prior or

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 55 of 60

concurrent acts manifesting approval, instigation, connivance, acquiescence,

participation and the like (including inaction in circumstances where there is a

duty to act); and from subsequent acts which manifest ratification or adoption.

While I use concepts and terminology of the law relating to agency, and vicarious

liability in delict, in my view responsibility under Article 126 would extend to all

situations in which the nexus between the individual and the executive makes it

equitable to attribute such responsibility. The executive, and the executive officers

from whom such authority flows would all be responsible for the infringement.

Conversely, when an infringement by an executive officer, by executive or

administrative action, is directly and effectively the consequence of the act of a

private individual (whether by reason of instigation, connivance, participation or

otherwise) such individual is also responsible for the executive or administrative

action and the infringement caused thereby. In any event this Court would have

power under Article 126(4) to make orders and directions against such an

individual in order to afford relief to the victim.

The aforementioned was cited with approval by His Lordship Aluwihare J in Ganeshan

Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and Others S.C (F/R) 405/2018, SC

Minutes of 20.09.2023 at p. 21. The 6th Respondent of the Samson Roy Case was a

private citizen, whose false complaint instigated an arbitrary arrest. The said 6th

Respondent was directed to pay compensation to the Petitioner in view of his

involvement in the violation of fundamental rights.

Hence, I do not see any jurisdictional impediment on account of the 4th Respondents

civilian status at the time material. As the 4th Respondent has interestingly opted to

file joint Objections and Written Submissions with the 1st and 2nd Respondents, his

contentions, too, suffer the same infirmities, which I have adverted to above. In view

of this, I find the 4th Respondent liable for the violation of Petitioners fundamental

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 56 of 60

rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) for the same reasons as the 1st and 2nd

Respondents.

5th Respondent

With regards to the 5th Respondent, it is clear from paragraphs 22, 23, 24 and 25 of

the aforementioned Affidavit of Nimal Perera dated 08th June 2011, produced marked

P12, he, then a Superintendent of Police, has paid a visit to the place where the

Petitioner and several others were detained on 17th December 2010. The affidavit

further states that the 5th Respondent himself beat the Petitioner with a three-wheel

rubber band after stripping him naked and ordering him to rub Siddhalepa on his

genitalia. The 5th Respondent is specifically referred to therein by his name and rank,

as it was then.

The Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner along with the aforementioned affidavits

marked P10, P11 and P12, was filed before this Court on 02nd March 2012. Written

Submissions of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents was filed on 19th November 2013,

almost 20 months later. Even at that point, nothing was filed on behalf of the 5th

Respondent.

In the interest of justice, on 19th May 2020, the Court directed the Registrar to serve

notices on the 3rd and 5th Respondents informing them of the next date of hearing.

The notice sent to the 5th Respondent was not returned. Written submissions of the

Attorney-General on behalf of the 5th and 6th Respondents was filed on 26th September

2023.

As can be seen, the Respondents of the instant case were afforded ample opportunities

to plead their cases before this Court. Upon direction by the Court, the 5th Respondent,

too, filed Affidavit dated 05th October 2023. The said Affidavit only related to the Code

of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Acts. The 5th Respondent, represented by the

Attorney-General, has not at any point during the proceedings rejected or objected to

the allegations against him hereinbefore set out.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 57 of 60

Therefore, I find the 5th Respondent to have tortured the Petitioner in violation of his

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution. For this very

reason, and by the very fact, I find the 5th Respondent to have further violated the

Petitioner's rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

It is also revealed by the Minute on the document marked Rx(1), the 1st, 2nd and 4th

Respondents Statement of Objections and the excerpts from the

annexed thereto marked

Rx(2) that the 5th Respondent himself ordered the investigation and that he has had

intimate knowledge of the investigation.

With regards to the violation of Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution, from the

aforementioned facts, it is clear that the 5th Respondent had knowledge of the

Petitioners detention on account of his visit on 17th December 2010 for a brief session

of torture. The 5th Respondent had received the anonymous complaint describing the

involvement of the Petitioner and 3 others by name only 5 days before the arrest, and,

when the 5th Respondent arrived at the torture chamber on 17th December 2010, he

had inquired from another Police Officer [who are they], to which the

other Police Officer replied [Sir, this is

the parties involved in that Sargent Majors case]. Such a loose reference to a matter

alludes to the fact that not only did the 5th Respondent have knowledge of the arrest

of the Petitioner and the 3 others, but that he was kept updated on the events that

transpired after the arrest on 15th December 2010. As such, it appears that the

Petitioner was kept detained without producing before a Magistrate within the legally

stipulated time frame with full knowledge of the 5th Respondent. Therefore, I hold the

5th Respondent, too, to have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

enshrined under Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

While findings of fundamental rights violations are ample, the wrongdoersespecially

the big fish in the pondare seldom held duly accountable. Senior officers, under

whose authority and direction their subordinates may act, have a special duty to ensure

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 58 of 60

that they do not abuse such authority or go beyond such direction. Senior officers

cannot merely give orders and thereafter sleep on this duty. They are to closely

scrutinize the conduct of their subordinates. The stars that adorn their uniforms are

not ornaments of power, but rather, reminders of the immense responsibility that

comes with their authority.

Gross neglect of this duty would render them complicit in the actions of their unruly

subordinates. The concept of commission by omission is well recognized in our

constitutional jurisprudence by cases such as the Easter Sunday Cases,

SC/FR/163/2019, SC Minutes of 12th January 2023.

I am of the view that supervising officers are to be directly held liable for the conduct

of their subordinates in appropriate instances, even in the absence of direct

participation. Supervising officers can be held liable where there is affirmatory

participation or participatory presence on the part of such supervising officers; or,

where they have, directly or indirectly, implemented or enabled unconstitutional

policies by turning a blind eye towards unconstitutional practices directly under their

authority.

What is revealed to us in the instant case, apparent from what I have cited above from

the affidavits, is a pattern of grave derelictions, which has persisted for a considerable

period of time. Where such a pattern is observable, what other inference are we to

draw than, either the wrongdoings have taken place with the blessings of the direct

supervisors or that such supervisors have slept on the wheel? In either case, such

supervisors are directly complicit in the actions so enabled.

From the circumstances established in the instant case, it is clear that the 5th

Respondent has enabled, through his actions as well as inaction, the conduct of the

1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents, making him directly liable for the fundamental rights

violations hereinbefore established. No material has been produced before this Court

by the 5th Respondent so as to distance himself from such violations.

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 59 of 60

Therefore, I hold the 5th Respondent to have violated the fundamental rights of the

Petitioner guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

ORDERS OF THE COURT

Although relief is granted principally against the State in fundamental rights

jurisdiction, in appropriate cases, cursus curiae with regards to awarding compensation

has been to direct culpable officers to personally make amends. This appears to me a

fit case to make such orders.

In cases of this nature, where the violations are grave, while the State must absolutely

take responsibility, I do not see it sufficient to merely impose the liability on the State.

I do not see it just and equitable to impose upon the taxpayer the burden of

compensating for the transgressions of errant officials. Having borne the burden of

their earnings over the years, must the taxpayer compensate for their misdeeds as well?

Furthermore, the amount of compensation awarded must sufficiently reflect the gravity

of the offences as well as the audacity of the offenders. Especially where violations of

Article 11 are to be found, it is necessary to award compensation in such amounts

adequate to deter such degenerates.

Therefore, we direct the National Police Commission and other relevant authorities to

take appropriate disciplinary action against the officers we have found to be

responsible.

The Respondents are ordered to pay compensation to the Petitioner in the following

manner:

1. The State is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 100,000/- (Rupees

Hundred Thousand) out of the funds allocated to the Police Department, given

the institutional issues observed;

2. The 1st Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 500,000/-

(Rupees Five-Hundred Thousand);

SC (FR) Application No.107/2011 JUDGMENT Page 60 of 60

3. The 2nd Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 500,000/-

(Rupees Five-Hundred Thousand); and

4. The 4th Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 500,000/-

(Rupees Five-Hundred Thousand).

5. The 5th Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 500,000/-

(Rupees Five-Hundred Thousand).

The 1st,2nd,4th and 5th Respondents are to pay the aforementioned sums, within six

months from the date of judgement, out of their personal funds.

Application allowed.
