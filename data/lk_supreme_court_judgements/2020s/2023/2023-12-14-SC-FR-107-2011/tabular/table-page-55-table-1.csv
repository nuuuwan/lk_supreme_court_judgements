"duty to act); and from subsequent acts which manifest ratification or adoption."
"While I use concepts and terminology of the law relating to agency, and vicarious"
"liability in delict, in my view responsibility under Article 126 would extend to all"
"situations in which the nexus between the individual and the executive makes it"
"equitable to attribute such responsibility. The executive, and the executive officers"
"from whom such authority flows would all be responsible for the infringement."
"Conversely,  when  an 
infringement  by  an  executive  officer,  by  executive  or"
"administrative action, is directly and effectively the consequence of the act of a"
"private individual (whether by reason of instigation, connivance, participation or"
"otherwise) such individual is also responsible for the executive or administrative"
"action and the infringement caused thereby. In any event this Court would have"
"power  under  Article  126(4)  to  make  orders  and  directions  against  such  an"
"individual in order to afford relief to the victim.‚Äù"
