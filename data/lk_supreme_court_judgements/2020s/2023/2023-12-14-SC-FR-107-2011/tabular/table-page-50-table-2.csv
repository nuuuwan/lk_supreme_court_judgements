"2023,  the  matters  are  disturbing,  to  say  the  least.  His  Lordship  further  expressed"
"concerns therein vis-à-vis the modus operandi of Sri Lanka Police:"
"“…Sri Lanka Police established in 1806, has a history of over two centuries and"
"one  would  expect  it  to  develop  into  a  body  that  comprises  of  professional  law"
"enforcement personnel. I am at a loss to understand, in the present day and time"
"as to why such an established law enforcement entity is incapable of affording"
"due protection to a citizen who is in their custody. Unfortunately, it is not rare to"
"hear instances of suspects dying in the hands of the police. It only highlights the"
"utterly unprofessional approach to duty by the personnel who man it and as a"
"consequence,  people  are  increasingly  losing  trust  in  the  police.  It  had  lost  the"
"credibility it ought to enjoy as a law enforcement agency. The incident relevant"
"to  this  application  had  taken  place  in  2008,  however,  this  court  observes  that"
"instances of death of suspects in police custody are continuing to happen, even"
"today. It appears that the hierarchy of the administration had paid scant attention"
"to arrest this trend which does not augur well for the law enforcement and the"
"rule of law.”"
