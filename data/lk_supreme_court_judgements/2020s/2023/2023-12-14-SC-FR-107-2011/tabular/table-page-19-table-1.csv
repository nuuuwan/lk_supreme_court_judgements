"therein is most certainly questionable. The officers must in such instances be prudent"
"to conduct an investigation so as to confirm such information before acting on the"
"same. However, the Respondents have failed to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy"
"this Court that they had conducted  an appropriate investigation prior to instigating"
"the arrest of the Petitioner."
"It  was  most  certainly 
reasonable 
for 
then  Superintendent  of  Police,  T.M.W.D."
"Tennakoon, to direct an investigation with regards to the complaint so received, as it"
"is the duty of a police officer to duly respond to such complaints, even when they are"
"anonymous.  However,  once  such  an  order  or  direction  is  made  by  a  senior  police"
"officer, as I shall discuss in detail later on, they are duty-bound to ensure that such"
"directions are properly carried out, with due regard to the procedure established by"
"law."
"It  appears 
in  the 
instant  case  that  the  Respondents  have 
failed  to  sufficiently"
"investigate the anonymous complaint made. I do not wish to state, by any means, that"
"police officers should refrain from acting on anonymous complaints, but rather that an"
"officer must take some steps to confirm the legitimacy of such complaints. While wide"
"powers are vested with police officers to carry out their investigations, when it comes"
"to any act which may impinge upon the individual liberties of a person, officers must"
"observe utmost caution. The officers in question could have, at the least, interviewed"
"some  persons  living  in  the  area  and  recorded  their  statements  so  as  to  verify  the"
"veracity  of  the  allegations  levelled  against  the  Petitioner  and  several  others  by  the"
"anonymous  letter  and  the  unnamed  informant.  However,  no  evidence  has  been"
"produced before this Court by the Respondents to establish that  such actions have"
"been taken. Therefore, in my view, it cannot be said that the Respondents have acted"
"upon a reasonable complaint or upon reasonable suspicion as required by section 32"
"of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979."
