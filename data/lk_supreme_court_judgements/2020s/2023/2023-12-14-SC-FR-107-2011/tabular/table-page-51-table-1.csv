"Having expressed these worries, his Lordship directed the Inspector General of Police"
"to formulate, issue and implement guidelines to the police elaborating as to how the"
"standards may be improved."
"Years  prior  to  these  observations,  in  Landage  Ishara  Anjali  (Minor)  v.  Waruni"
"Bogahawatte, SC (FR) Application No. 677/2012, SCM of 12.06.2019 Aluwihare J."
"has similarly raised concerns with regards to the growing number of incidents of abuse"
"of power. There, too, the Inspector General of Police was directed to issue guidelines"
"regarding the same. In addition to such direction, his Lordship has further postulated"
"guiding principles to be included in any such guidelines to be issued."
"Following the directions of His Lordship in Mohammed Rashid Fathima Sharmila v."
"K.W.G.  Nishantha  (supra),  the  Inspector  General  of  Police  has  issued  IGP  Circular"
"2747/2023 dated 25th March 2023. While this circular has specifically referred to this"
"case,  I  cannot  help  but  notice  that  it  has  not  sufficiently  encompassed  the  guiding"
"principles  Aluwihare  J.  postulated  in  Landage  Ishara  Anjali  (Minor)  v.  Waruni"
"Bogahawatte  (supra).  In  particular,  the  elements  concerning  human  dignity,  non-"
"discrimination, proportionality and rights of children."
"As such, we direct the National Police Commission and the relevant authorities to give"
"due recognition to these principles in formulating any future guidelines. Moreover, we"
"direct  the  National  Police  Commission  to  see  to  it  that  these  guidelines—including"
"Circular 2747/2023 and the principles I have noted it to have omitted—are properly"
"implemented and are integrated into the training of police officers."
"LIABILITY OF THE RESPONDENTS"
"The 3rd Respondent, Madiwaka Adikari Mudiyanselage Egodawele Wallauwe Senerath"
"Adikari Egodawele, the Head Quarters Inspector, Mirihana Police Station, at the time"
"material to this case, by his Affidavit dated 5th October 2011, averred that the conduct"
"in  question  did  not  take  place  under  his  direct  supervision.  In  view  of  the  facts"
"disclosed therein, the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner informed this Court on 11th"
"SC (FR) Application No.107/2011               JUDGMENT                                    Page 51 of 60"
