"Informing the Reasons for Arrest"
"Apart from Article 13(1) itself, section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No."
"15 of 1979. Section 23(1) provides as follows:"
"“In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch or confine"
"the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to the custody"
"by word or action and shall inform the person to be arrested of the nature of the"
"charge or allegation upon which he is arrested."
"As  Sharvananda  J,  as  His  Lordship  was  then,  stated  in  Mariadas  Raj  v.  Attorney-"
"General FRD(2) 397 at pp. 402-404,"
"“The law is solicitous for the freedom of the individual and has therefore enacted"
"that the person who is arrested is entitled to know the reason for his arrest and"
"has elevated this right into a fundamental right with the attendant sanctions for"
"its breach… Article 13(1) embodies a rule which has always been regarded as vital"
"and fundamental for safeguarding the personal liberty in all legal systems where"
"the  Rule  of  Law  prevails…  The  purpose  of  this  rule  is  to  afford  the  earliest"
"opportunity to the arrested person to remove any mistake, misapprehension or"
"misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting official and disabuse his mind of"
"the suspicion which actuated the arrest.”"
"I  unreservedly  echo  this  astute  observation  of  His  Lordship.  As  apparent  from  the"
"rationale  so  set  out,  the  requirement  of  informing  the  reasons  for  one’s  arrest  also"
"marks a vital step in the investigation process. Even where an officer arrests the correct"
"person, who is subsequently convicted by a court of law, if such person is not informed"
"of the reason for his arrest at the time of arrest, that amounts to a violation of Article"
"13(1) of the Constitution, without prejudice to such conviction. Misidentifications are"
"common enough that it is vital for law enforcement authorities to afford any person"
"being arrested an opportunity to explain themselves."
"SC (FR) Application No.107/2011               JUDGMENT                                    Page 20 of 60"
