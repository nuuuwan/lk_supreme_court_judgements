"December  2010,  by  which  date  4  days  had  already  passed.  This,  as  established,  is"
"absolutely obnoxious to the ‘special provisions’ the Respondents themselves relied on."
"Persons  in  detention,  regardless  of  the  charges  or  accusations  against  them,  are"
"entitled to the fullest protection of their human dignity and physical integrity.  State"
"institutions and those who serve the State are sternly reminded of their obligation to"
"ensure that persons in detention are treated not only within the bounds of legality but"
"with an uncompromising adherence to the principles of humanity. This stance is not"
"only a legal mandate, but also a relentless moral imperative."
"The manner in which the 1st, 2nd and 5th Respondents, being officers of the law, have"
"conducted themselves, in concert with the 4th Respondent, is a stark betrayal of the"
"Rule  of  Law.  They  have  acted  in  a  manner  entirely  repugnant  to  the  virtues  of  a"
"democratic republic."
"In  these  circumstances,  I  have  no  qualm  holding  the  treatment  the  Petitioner  had"
"undergone to be a gross violation of his fundamental rights recognised under Article"
"12(1) of the Constitution."
"CONCLUSION OF THE COURT"
"Considering the inconsistencies in the Respondents’ version of events and the fact that"
"the Petitioner’s version of events is corroborated by the Medical Report issued by the"
"Judicial  Medical  Officer  of  the  District  General  Hospital  of  Matale  as  well  as  the"
"affidavits of those who were detained and tortured with him, this Court is left with no"
"other  option  but  to  reject  the  position  of  the  Respondents  in  toto  and  accept  the"
"Petitioner’s version of events as true."
"The Petitioner’s fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) have been"
"blatantly  violated  by  the  1st,  2nd,  4th  and  5th  Respondents.  The  kind  of  conduct  on"
"display, judged even by the lowest of standards, amounts to a magnificent failure of"
"all that the Rule of Law stands for."
