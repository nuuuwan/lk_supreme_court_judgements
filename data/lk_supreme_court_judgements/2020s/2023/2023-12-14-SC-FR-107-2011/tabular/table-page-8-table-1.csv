"Since there were no such goods, the Petitioner was mercilessly assaulted over and over"
"again with another “පපාල්ලක්” [club] until that, too, broke. The Petitioner states that"
"thereafter the said Police Officers began trampling his face since he had fallen on the"
"ground. The Petitioner states that at one point his wife and two children were taken to"
"one of the rooms and were not permitted to come out, to prevent them from shouting,"
"while the 1st and 2nd Respondents and other Police Officers continued to assault the"
"Petitioner."
"Immediately thereafter, the Petitioner was taken in the van again to the Mirihana Police"
"Station. The Petitioner was taken to the top floor of the said Mirihana Police Station,"
"handcuffed and asked to sit on the floor beside the chair. The Petitioner then saw that"
"Chandana, the driver of the three-wheeler, was permitted to make a statement and to"
"leave  thereafter.  The  Petitioner  was  thereafter  taken  to  what  appeared  to  be  'the"
"torture chambers' of the Mirihana Police Station, where he was assaulted mercilessly."
"The Petitioner states that one of the Police Officers assaulted the Petitioner's thighs"
"with a pole till he was numb and fell. Thereafter a Police Officer began assaulting him"
"with a ‘three-wheeler belt’ and then he was hung on a beam upside down with his legs"
"and kept suspended for a while. Eventually, when he was taken down, he was forced"
"to have a bath. The Petitioner states that thereafter he was taken upstairs again and"
"questioned by the 1st and 2nd Respondents as to details of the aforementioned Nimal"
"and Chaminda and one Jayasena also known to the Petitioner. Then one of the Police"
"Officers said that they, too, had been brought and that the Petitioner would see them"
"in the morning. The Petitioner states that on or about 17th December 2010,  he was"
"taken to a place within the Mirihana Police Station, where the said Nimal, Chaminda"
"and Jayasena were. It was apparent that they too had been subjected to torture. The"
"Petitioner was questioned again about their involvement in the purported robbery of"
"the 4th Respondent's house, and he answered in the affirmative as he could not endure"
"being tortured anymore. However, the torture continued and all of them were beaten"
"mercilessly. The Petitioner states that thereafter he was taken upstairs, and one hand"
"and leg were cuffed together onto one leg of a table, as on several other occasions."
