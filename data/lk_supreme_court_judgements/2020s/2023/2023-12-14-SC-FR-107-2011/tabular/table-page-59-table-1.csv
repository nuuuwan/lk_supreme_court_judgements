"Therefore, I hold the 5th Respondent to have violated the fundamental rights of the"
"Petitioner guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution."
"ORDERS OF THE COURT"
"Although 
relief 
is  granted  principally  against 
the  State 
in 
fundamental 
rights"
"jurisdiction, in appropriate cases, cursus curiae with regards to awarding compensation"
"has been to direct culpable officers to personally make amends. This appears to me a"
"fit case to make such orders."
"In cases of this nature, where the violations are grave, while the State must absolutely"
"take responsibility, I do not see it sufficient to merely impose the liability on the State."
"I  do  not  see 
it 
just  and  equitable  to 
impose  upon  the  taxpayer  the  burden  of"
"compensating  for  the  transgressions  of  errant  officials.  Having  borne  the  burden  of"
"their earnings over the years, must the taxpayer compensate for their misdeeds as well?"
"Furthermore, the amount of compensation awarded must sufficiently reflect the gravity"
"of the offences as well as the audacity of the offenders. Especially where violations of"
"Article  11  are  to  be  found,  it  is  necessary  to  award  compensation  in  such  amounts"
"adequate to deter such degenerates."
"Therefore, we direct the National Police Commission and other relevant authorities to"
"take  appropriate  disciplinary  action  against 
the  officers  we  have 
found 
to  be"
"responsible."
"The Respondents are ordered to pay compensation to the Petitioner in the following"
"manner:"
