"the theft of the house of the 4th Respondent. The law requires police officers to inform"
"a person being arrested of the reason for the arrest with such precision so as to enable"
"the  arrestee  to  offer  an  explanation.  There  is  no  indication  of  such  reasons  being"
"provided to the Petitioner as the three-wheel driver was compelled to drive towards"
"the cemetery."

"The Petitioner states in his Petition that he was taken to the Dambara Cemetery where"
"the chain of torturous acts began, as narrated by the Petition dated 15th December"
"2010. However, all Respondents, particularly the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents by their"
"Statement  of  Objections  and  Written  Submissions  and  the  5th  Respondent  by  his"
"SC (FR) Application No.107/2011               JUDGMENT                                    Page 21 of 60"
