"times until he was in  unbearably  excruciating  pain.  Thereafter,  Nimal  and  Chaminda"
"were  questioned  as  to  what  was  stolen  and  where  the  goods  were.  Subsequently,"
"Nimal's  wife  brought  an  oven  claiming  that  it  was  one  of  the  'stolen  goods'  and"
"thereafter eventually the beatings ceased and they were handcuffed."
"The Petitioner states that he came to know that his wife, on coming to learn that he"
"was detained at the said Mirihana Police Station, had on several occasions come to the"
"Police  Station,  but  was  refused  access  on  every  such  instance.  In  fact,  on  one  such"
"occasion, when the Petitioner's wife was desperately searching for the Petitioner, she"
"was informed by one of the female Police Officers at the Mirihana Police Station that"
"the Petitioner was there but that she had been instructed not to grant access to him."
"The Petitioner further states that on or about 19th December 2010, all of them were"
"confined to a cell and at around 6:40 p.m., were taken to the residence of the Acting"
"Magistrate of Awissawella to obtain a detention order for 48 hours under the pretext"
"of having to conduct further investigations. Accordingly, the detention was extended,"
"and the suspects were to be produced in Court at 9:00 a.m. on 21st December 2010."
"The Petitioner however further states that the 2nd Respondent obtained such detention"
"order  by  stating  that  the  Petitioner  and  others  had  been  arrested  only  on  18th"
"December 2010."
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  when  the  said  Acting  Magistrate  questioned  the"
"Petitioner as to whether any injuries were inflicted while in custody, the Petitioner had"
"said there had not been such. The Petitioner states that the reasoning for answering"
"in this manner despite all the torture he had undergone over the past days was due to"
"the fact that he feared for his life, being fully aware of the consequences he was likely"
"to face and what further suffering he would be made to endure by the Police while"
"being  detained  if  he  had  informed  the  learned  Acting  Magistrate  of  the  treatment"
"meted  out  to  him  by  the  Respondents.  The  Petitioner  further  states  that  in  the"
"circumstances,  the  learned  Acting  Magistrate  too,  without  any  examination  of  the"
"Petitioner, recorded that there were no injuries, as borne out by the said record."
"SC (FR) Application No.107/2011               JUDGMENT                                    Page 10 of 60"
