"the  procedure  established  by  law.  All  that  they  have  produced  in  support  are  the"

"ඇමතුම් යතාරතුරු යපාත” is not an Information Book that is generally in use. Given the"
"incongruities  found  between  the  aforementioned  documents  and the  Respondents’"
"own averments, this Court cannot attribute any probative value to the same. As such,"
"the 1st and 2nd Respondents are no doubt liable for the violations of Articles 13(1) and"

"Submissions dated 19th November 2013, have merely offered a simple denial of the"

"and  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  concludes  and  opines  the  history  so  given  to  be"
"consistent with the 16 different injuries recorded in the Medico Legal Report."
"The position of the 1st, 2nd [and the 4th Respondent, as the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents"
"have filed joint Objections and Written Submissions] with regards to the Medico-Legal"
"Report is to simply claim the injuries therein to be non-corroborative of the history"
"recorded."
