JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare, PC, J.

(1) Accused Respondent Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was

charged before the magistrates court on three counts punishable under section

25[1] of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act number 2 of 1990 and one

count of Criminal Misappropriation punishable in terms of section 386 of the

Penal Code.

(2) At the conclusion of the trial, the learned magistrate having concluded that the

prosecution had failed to prove any of the charges preferred against the Accused,

found him not guilty as charged and proceeded to acquit him.

(3) Aggrieved by the order of acquittal, the Virtual Complainant Respondent

[hereinafter referred to as the Complainant] appealed against the said judgement

of the learned magistrate, sanction having first obtained from the Honourable

Attorney General, to the High Court.

(4) After hearing the appeal, the learned High Court judge in delivering the judgment,

holding that the learned magistrate had erred in finding the Accused not guilty

and acquitting him, set aside the said orders, and proceeded to convict the Accused

on all four counts.

(5) Further, the learned High Court judge also held that the prosecution had proved

the charges preferred against the Accused and that there was no impediment to

convict the Accused for the charges preferred against him.

(6) The present appeal arises from the said judgement of the High Court, and when

the matter was supported for special leave, the court granted special leave on the

questions of law referred to in in sub- paragraphs (a) to (g) of paragraph 12 of

the petition of the petitioner which are reproduced verbatim below.

(a) Did the learned High Court judge, err in holding that the Petitioner had failed

to establish that he has repaid the money relating to the loan for which as

guarantee the cheques in issue were given, whereas it was not the contention

of the Petitioner that he has already repaid the said sums and/or which is not

required to cast a doubt on the prosecution case?

(b) Did the learned High Court judge err in holding that the petitioner had failed

to reveal specific details of the transaction relating to documents V1 to V6,

5

whereas there is no burden in law for the accused to prove the same other

than to cast doubt on the prosecution case.

(c) Has the learned High Court judge failed to evaluate the evidence relating to

each charge individually, which is prior to the petitioners conviction for all

four counts as required by law?

(d) Did the learned High Court judge fail to consider that the version of the

prosecution would not satisfy the test of probability, whereas evidence of PW-

1 in respect of selling apparels to the petitioner was not proved before the

court and/or has not been corroborated?

(e) Did the learned High Court judge err in law by failing to consider that the

petitioner could not be found guilty for count 2 and count 3 as the same were

framed under section 25 (1) (a) of the Debt Recovery (special provisions) Act

and/or the petitioner has stopped the payments of the two cheques relating

the set counts?

(f) Did the learned High Court judge, in law by failing to consider that the

petitioner could not be found guilty for Count 4 as the prosecution has failed

to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the readymade garments had been

taken/obtained by the petitioner?

(g) Did the learned High Court judge fail to consider that the contention of the

petitioner is more probable than the version of the respondent.

The factual background

(7) According to the Virtual Complainant, he being a trader in textiles and finished

garments, sold a stock of garments to the Accused in December 2011 to the value

of Rs.2.5 million and had received cheques from the Accused as payment. An

6

invoice for the said amount [P5] and a Gate Pass [P1] signed by the accused in

proof of delivery, were produced in evidence.

(8) The invoice clearly indicates that the goods had been supplied to the Accused

whom the Complainant knew of, having had business dealings with him

previously and the Accused had signed at the foot of the invoice acknowledging

the acceptance of the stock of garments.

(9) It appears that, what had been given by the Accused were post-dated cheques and

the details are as follows;

[1] A cash Cheque no 196169 dated 30.03. 2012 drawn for Rs 850,000/-[P2]

[2] A cash Cheque no 196170 dated 30.04. 2012 drawn for Rs 850,000/-[P3]

[3] A cash Cheque no 196171 dated 15.05. 2012 drawn for Rs 800,000/-[P5]

(9) All three cheques were dishonoured in the following manner.

[i] The cheque No.196169, when presented to the bank, had bounced with the

endorsement refer to the drawer (01). The code (01) is the standardised

bank code used to denote that there were insufficient funds in the account of

the drawer to meet the payment.

[ii] When cheque No. 169170 was presented it also had returned with the

endorsement payment stopped by the drawer (52). The code (52) is the

standardised bank code used to denote a directive from the drawer/ account

holder countermanding the payment.

[iii] When the cheque No. 169171 was presented for payment, that too has

bounced with the endorsement Account closed (51).

(10) A junior executive officer of the Commercial Bank, Lakshita Hewawasam in his

testimony produced the details of the bank account maintained by the Accused

7

with the Kotahena branch of the Commercial Bank. According to the witness, of

the three cheques in question, the cheque number 196169 drawn for Rs.850,

000/- was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the accuseds account to

meet the payment. Cheque No. 169170 drawn for rupees 850000/- was

dishonoured as the account holder [the Accused] countermanded the payment,

while the third cheque for Rs. 800,000/- when presented for payment on

15.8.2012, the account had been closed by the accused Rasalingam on 8. 5.

2022.

(11) The accused giving evidence under oath stated that he borrowed Rs.2.4 million

as a lump sum on interest from the virtual complainant and issued 3 cheques.

His position was that he paid the Complainant Rs.125000/- a month, as interest.

The Accused, however, conceded that there is no documentary proof of the

monies that he alleged to have borrowed from the Complainant or any proof of

interest payments made by him as alleged. The Accused, however, denied that he

ever engaged in any transaction relating to garments and denied the signature

on the Gate Pass P1 as his.

(12) It appears from the evidence led at the trial, that prior to the impugned

transaction relevant to these proceedings, there had been business dealings

between the two parties which the Complainant admitted in his evidence. The

documents V1 and V2 were produced in that regard, but both those documents

are dated in 2011 whereas the impugned cheques had been dated in 2012. The

virtual Complainant had said that documents V1 and V2 have no connection

with the sale of garments. As such there does not appear to be a nexus between

those two sets of documents and the impugned transaction.

Legal issues

(13) Having considered the evidence led at the trial, this court is of the view that the

prosecution had failed to establish the offence of Criminal Misappropriation.

Although the learned High Court Judge had concluded that all elements of the

8

said charge had been established, with due respect to the learned judge, I beg

to disagree with the said conclusion.

(14) As far as the charge of Criminal Misappropriation is concerned, the allegation

is that the accused dishonestly misappropriated the garments he obtained

from the virtual complainant. It is clear from the evidence that this was a pure

and simple sale of goods and once the virtual complainant parted with the

consignment of garments, the Accused was free to appropriate it in any

manner he wished. Simply, there was no arrangement between the Virtual-

Complainant and the Accused as to the manner in which the garments should

be dealt with. Hence, one cannot say that the accused misappropriated the

garments.

(15) For the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that the charge of Criminal

Misappropriation is not made out and the conviction of the Accused for the

said offence cannot be sustained. Accordingly, the conviction of the accused

for the charge of Criminal Misappropriation [the 4th count] is hereby set aside

and accordingly I make order acquitting the Accused on that count.

(16) For the reasons set out above I answer the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (f) of paragraph 12 of the Petition in the affirmative.

(17) The remaining questions of law (a) to (e) and (g) relate to the conviction for the offences under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act.

(18) Before I deal with the liability of the Accused in terms of provision of the Act under which he was charged, I wish to consider the argument of the learned Counsel for the Accused where he argued that the learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence led at the trial and in particular, to evaluate evidence relating to each charge before convicting the Accused. In this regard,

9

I wish to rely on the principle laid down in the case of Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 1990 1 SLR 280.

(19) It would be pertinent at this point to address our minds to the Constitutional

provision embodied in Article 138 which sets down the criteria in granting relief

in exercising Appellate jurisdiction. The proviso to the Article reads;

Provided that no judgement, decree, or order of any court shall

be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or

irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned a failure of justice. [emphasis added]

Although the Article referred to above occurs in the Constitution under the

heading The Court of Appeal, the proviso referred to should be

considered a guiding principle when a forum is exercising appellate

jurisdiction

It is also to be noted that the proviso to Article 138 referred to above, is mirrored

in Section; 334(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of1979

[hereinafter the CPC] the application of which was considered by a bench of five

judges of this court in the case of Mannar Mannan [supra].

(20) The proviso to Section 334(1) of the CPC reads thus;

Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point

raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the

appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually

occurred ".

In the case of R v.Nicholas Webb Edwards [1983] EWCA Crim J0228-2, the court

considered some of the earlier English cases touching on the applicability of a

proviso which is similar to that of our Constitution. This was a case where the

appellant was convicted of rape and the sole ground of appeal was that there was

a failure to direct the jury on the standard of proof. Goff L. J., in the course of his

10

judgment stated: "It is plain that the failure of the Judge to direct the jury on the

standard of proof was a serious defect in the summing up.................. That being

so, we have to consider whether we should exercise our powers under the

proviso to section 2 (1) of the Criminal Appeal Act of 1968 to dismiss the appeal

if we consider that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. From those

cases it appears that in such a case, as in any other case, the court must consider

the operation of the proviso in the light of the particular facts of the case.

[emphasis is mine].

(21) In answering the questions of law referred to above, all what this court has to

consider is whether the prosecution has established, beyond reasonable doubt,

the charges preferred against the accused under section 25 (1) of the Debt

Recovery (special provisions) Act [Hereinafter the Act].

(22) Section 25(1) of the Act states thus; (1) Any person who-

(a) knowingly draws a cheque which is dishonoured by a bank for

want of funds;

(b) gives an order to a banker to pay a sum of money, which

payment is not made by reason of there being no obligation

on such banker to make payment or the order given being

subsequently countermanded with a dishonest intention, or;

and

(c) gives an authority to an institution to pay a sum of money to itself,

in payment of a debt or loan or any part thereof owed to such

institution, from, and out of an account maintained or funds

deposited, by such person with such institution and such

institution is unable to take such payment to itself by reason of

such person not placing adequate funds in such account or by

11

reason of the funds deposited having been withdrawn by reason

of such person countermanding the authority given or by reason

of any one or more of such reasons ; or

(d) having accepted an inland bill refuses payment dishonestly; 5.

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on conviction by a

Magistrate after summary trial be liable to punishment with imprisonment of

either description for a term which may extend to one year or with fine of ten

thousand rupees or ten per centum of the full value of the cheque, order,

authority or inland bill in respect of which the offence is committed, whichever

is higher, or with both such fine and imprisonment.

(23) At this juncture it would be pertinent to consider the liability under the penal

provision referred to above. It is clear that the provision is not a strict liability

provision and a mental element is part of the offence.

In an instance where a cheque is dishonoured due to lack of sufficient funds, the

requisite mental element is knowledge on the part of the Accused, whereas when

the reason for a cheque to be dishonoured is either the same being

countermanded or closure of the account after the cheque was issued, then the

mental element that has to be established is one of dishonesty.

(24) It is my view, that in a prosecution under Section 25 of the Act, the reason or the

reasons as to the issuance of the cheque is not relevant, as the nature of the

transaction is immaterial as far as the offence is concerned. In the instant case

the liability of the Accused has to be considered in the following manner;

Regarding the cheque No. No 196169 dated 30.03. 2012, the liability has to be

considered under paragraph (a) of Section 25 (1) of the Act whilst in relation to

cheques bearing Nos. 196170 and 196171, what would be applicable is

paragraph (b) of that Section.

(25) In relation to count No.1, which is based on the Cheque 196169 what the

prosecution was required to prove, in order to satisfy the ingredients of the

12

offence was that the cheque that was drawn by the Accused was dishonoured

due to insufficient funds and that the Accused had knowledge that the funds were

insufficient to meet the cheque. It is common ground that the cheque was drawn

by the Accused and the fact that it was dishonoured was not disputed by him

either. It has also been established that the cause for dishonouring was due to

lack of funds.

(26) The monthly bank statements of the Accuseds business establishment for the

months of January to May 2012 were marked and produced at the trial [P7]. In

the normal course of events the account holder [Accused] ought to have received

them at the end of each month. None of these statements reflect a sufficient credit

balance to meet any of the cheques that the Accused issued to the Complainant.

(27) In any event there was no material placed before the court to show that the

Accused did not have the knowledge that the credit balance was insufficient to

meet the cheque. Regard being had to common course of natural events and

human conduct plus the attended circumstances, it would be reasonable for the

court to presume that the Accused was aware that the amount of money lying to

his credit in the bank account in question was insufficient[to meet the cheques]

at the time relevant to the impugned transaction.

(28) On the other hand, if any facts were especially within the knowledge of the

Accused which was indicative of lack of knowledge on his part as to the funds

lying to the credit of the bank account, then it was incumbent on the Accused to

prove that fact within the meaning of Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance.

The illustration to Section 106 reads thus;

A person is charged with travelling on a railway without a

ticket. The burden of proving that he had a ticket on him

13

(29) Considering the above, I hold that the learned High Court Judge was correct in

coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has established count No.1 beyond

reasonable doubt.

(30) As far as count 3 is concerned, the conduct of the Accused in closing the bank

account before the due date on which the cheque No. 196171 could have been

presented for payment, appears to be a deliberate act on his part to deprive the

Complainant of encashing the cheque in question. When the cheque was

presented for payment by the Complainant, there was no obligation on the

banker to make the payment, thus fulfilling the requisite elements of paragraph

(b) of Section 25(1) of the Act.

(31) Here, again the attendant circumstances are indicative of dishonesty on the part

of the Accused in the absence of any material to infer otherwise. As such the

conviction of the Accused on count 3 also cannot be faulted.

The questions of law

(32) The question (a) raises the issue as to whether the learned High Court judge,

erred in holding that the Petitioner [the Accused] had failed to establish that he

has repaid the money relating to the loan for which as guarantee the checks in

issue were given. Firstly, it must be said that what the learned High Court Judge

had said was, that the Accused had argued that the cheques were given in respect

of a loan obtained by the Accused but the Accused had failed to establish that the

loan had been repaid. As referred to earlier, these matters are irrelevant as far

as the requisite elements of the offence and as such the manner in which the

learned High Court Judge dealt with this aspect has no bearing on the charges.

As such I answer the question of law (a) above in the negative.

(33) The question of law referred to in paragraph (b) raises the issue as to whether

the learned High Court judge erred in holding that the Accused had failed to

reveal specific details of the transaction relating to documents V1 to V6, whereas

14

there is no burden in law for the accused to prove the same other than to cast

doubt on the prosecution case. As referred to earlier, there does not appear to be

any nexus between V1 to V6 and the impugned transactions relevant to this case.

V1 refers to a cheque drawn on the Bank of Ceylon for Rs. 400,000/- V5 also

refers to a cheque issued from the account the Accused maintained at the Bank

of Ceylon, however, all the cheques relating to this case had been drawn on the

Commercial Bank. It also refers to a cheque drawn for Rs.400, 000/-. None of

the cheques relevant to the instant case had been drawn for Rs. 400,000/-. As

such I am of the view that even if the learned High Court Judge had considered

the documents V1 to V 6, he could not have arrived at a different decision. In the

circumstances, I answer the question (b) referred to above also in the negative.

(34) The question of law referred to in paragraph (c) raises the issue as to whether

the learned High Court judge failed to evaluate the evidence relating to each

charge individually as required by law. As regard to the question of law raised,

it is true that a court is required to consider each charge separately and decide

as to whether the requisite actus reus and the mens rea have been established by

the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, before entering a conviction. The

complaint in the instant case appears to be that the learned Judge had not done

so. Upon perusal of the judgement, it appears that the contention on behalf of the

Accused is correct in this regard. The question is whether the accused must be

given the benefit of every non-direction or misdirection on the part of the learned

judge. I do not think so. Even if there was a non-direction, if that non-direction

had not caused any prejudice to the Accused or had not resulted in any failure of

justice there is no reason then, to vary the judgement. Upon considering the

entirety of the evidence led at the trial, I am of the view that if the learned High

Court Judge had directed himself properly, he could not have come to a different

conclusion other than finding the accused guilty. As such I answer the question

of law referred to in paragraph (c) referred to above also in the negative.

15

(35) Question of law referred to in paragraph (d) raises the issue as to whether the

learned High Court judge failed to consider that the version of the prosecution

would not satisfy the test of probability whereas evidence of the Complainant in

respect of selling apparels to the petitioner was not proved before the court and

or has not been corroborated. This aspect again is not relevant in deciding the

issues in this case as all what the learned High Court Judge was required to

consider as to whether the requisite elements of the offence had been established

or not and the probability of the version given by the Accused has no bearing on

the charges as the Accused had not denied issuing the cheques. As such the

question of law (d) too is answered in the negative.

(36) The question of law referred to in paragraph (e) raises the question as to whether

the learned High Court judge erred in law by failing to consider that the

petitioner could not be found guilty for count 2 and count 3 as the same were

framed under section 25 (1) (a) of the Debt Recovery (special provisions) Act. In

relation to count 2 and 3, the violations come under paragraph (b) of Section

25(1) and not under paragraph (a) of that section. The penal provision, however,

is common to both limbs. Furthermore, in the body of the charges the specific

reason as to the dishonouring of the cheques are referred to. In count 2 the actual

reason for dishonouring of the cheque was due to the Accused countermanding

the payment and not due to insufficient funds. However, the body of the charge

states; knowing that the cheque would be dishonoured due to lack of funds to

meet the cheque you issued it. As far as the said count was concerned what the

prosecution had established through the bank official was that they did not

honour the cheque as the Accused instructed the bank to stop payment and the

issue of insufficiency funds was not raised. Hence, to my mind the finding of guilt

on count No. 2 was erroneous. As such, as far as count 2 is concerned, I answer

the question of law referred to in paragraph (e) in the affirmative and set aside

the finding of guilt and the conviction of the Accused on the said count. The

situation, however, is different in respect of count 3 which specifically says after

issuing a cheque dated 15. 05.2012 the Accused closed the bank Account. It is a

16

known fact that in banking practices a cheque is valid for a period of six months

from the date of its issuance. If a purposive construction is to be given to Section

25 of the Act, it would be reasonable to expect a reasonable man to make certain

that all the cheques that had been issued by him had been presented for payment

before taking the step of closing the bank Account. If a person acts with honesty,

it would be reasonable to expect that person to inform any party to whom such

person has issued cheques, his intention to close the bank account giving them a

window to present any cheques for payment. In the instant case the Accused had

not taken any such step which goes to indicate the dishonest intention on the part

of the Accused. In the circumstance I hold that the finding of the Accused guilty

on Count 3 is in accordance with the law and I answer the question of law

referred to in paragraph (e) in the negative in respect of count 3.

(37) I have already dealt with the question of law referred to in paragraph (f) in

paragraphs (13) to (16) of this judgement and answered the issue, as such I do

not wish to repeat it here.

(38) The question of law referred to in paragraph (f) raises the question as to whether

the learned High Court judge failed to consider that the contention of the

petitioner [Accused] is more probable than the version of the respondent. I have

expressed the view that the nature of the transaction is not material to decide the

liability under Section 25(1) of the Act, unless it is relevant to establish or negate

the requisite mens rea. The position taken up by the Accused was that the cheques

were given as he borrowed money from the Complainant whereas the

prosecution case is that it was given as payment for the stock of garments. When

one considers the facts peculiar to the instant case in considering the culpability

of the Accused, the non-consideration of probability of the Accused version has

no bearing on the charge. As such I answer the question of law raised in

paragraph (f) also in the negative.

Orders of the Court

17

The conviction of the Accused on counts 1 and 3 of the charge sheet dated 20th

February 2013 are affirmed.

The conviction of the Accused on counts 2 and 4 of the said charge sheet are set

aside and the accused is acquitted on the said counts.

As directed by the learned High Court judge, the magistrate is required to impose

an appropriate sentence upon considering the aggravating and mitigatory

factors.

The Registrar of this court is directed to return the original magistrates court

case record forthwith and to communicate the judgement of this court to the

learned magistrate.
