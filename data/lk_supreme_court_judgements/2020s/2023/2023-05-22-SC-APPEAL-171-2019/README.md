Introduction

As crystalised in the issues, the plaintiff filed this action in the District

Court of Mount Lavinia seeking a declaration of title to, ejectment of the

defendant from, the land described in the second schedule to the plaint

(which is part of the land described in the first schedule to the plaint),

and damages. The defendant claimed prescriptive title to the land

described in the second schedule to the plaint. After trial, the District

Court entered judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court of

Civil Appeal of Mount Lavinia set aside the judgment of the District Court

purely on the basis that the plaintiff did not prove title to the entirety of

the land but only to 11/12 shares of the land. This appeal by the plaintiff

is against the judgment of the High Court.

This Court has granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on the following

two questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court fail to consider that the defendant having

entered the premises as a licensee of the plaintiffs predecessor in

title cannot deny the ownership of the plaintiff?

4

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

(b) Did the High Court err in law by failing to consider that the

defendant being a trespasser could be ejected even by a co-owner?

Thereafter, the defendant has framed the following two questions of law:

(a) Is the plaintiff entitled to seek ejectment of the defendant from the

land described in the second schedule to the plaint without

establishing that the land described in the second schedule to the

plaint is part of the land described in the first schedule to the

plaint?

(b) If the plaintiff failed to establish it, has the plaintiffs action been

correctly dismissed by the High Court?

The District Court arrived at the finding that the defendant came into

occupation of the house standing on the land in suit as a licensee of the

father of Sithi Nazmy, namely Anzar, and continued in that capacity

under Sithi Nazmy as well. It is from Sithi Nazmy the plaintiff purchased

the land by the deed marked at the trial P3. The defendant in several

places in his evidence admitted that he came into occupation of the house

standing on the land described in the second schedule to the plaint at

the invitation of Anzar, until Anzar repaid the money owed to him, and

thereafter he has continued to occupy the house until now. The

defendant has come into occupation of the house in 1978. The District

Court dismissed the defendants claim of prescriptive title to the property.

The High Court did not state that the finding of the District Court that

the defendant did not succeed in his claim of prescriptive title was

erroneous. The High Court did not interfere with that finding at all.

The defendant cannot dispute the title of the plaintiff to the land

A defendant who enters into a land in a subordinate character such as a

tenant, lessee or licensee of the plaintiff is estopped from disputing the

5

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

title of the plaintiff to the land. Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance

enacts:

No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such

tenant, shall during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to

deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the beginning of the

tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and no person who

came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in

possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had

a title to such possession at the time when such licence was given.

One of the reasons for this fetter is that a person need not necessarily be

the owner of the subject matter to enter into such agreements with

another. Despite want of ownership, such agreements create valid legal

relationships such as landlord and tenant, lessor and lessee, licensor and

licensee between them although they are not binding on the real owner.

Vide Imbuldeniya v. De Silva [1987] 1 Sri LR 367, Gunasekera v. Jinadasa

[1996] 2 Sri LR 115 at 120, Pinona v. Dewanarayana [2004] 2 Sri LR 11.

In Ruberu v. Wijesooriya [1998] 1 Sri LR 58 at 60, Gunawardana J. held:

Whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is foreign to

a suit in ejectment against either. The licensee (the defendant-

respondent) obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it upon the

terms that he will not dispute the title of him, i.e. the plaintiff-

appellant without whose permission, he (the defendant-respondent)

would not have got it. The effect of the operation of section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title

under which he is in occupation he must, first, quit the land. The fact

that the licensee or the lessee obtained possession from the plaintiff-

appellant is perforce an admission of the fact that the title resides in

the plaintiff. No question of title can possibly arise on the pleadings

6

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

in this case, because, as the defendant-respondent has stated in his

answer that he is a lessee under the plaintiff-appellant, he is

estopped from denying the title of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an

inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will ever be permitted

either to question the title of the person who gave him the lease or

the licence or the permission to occupy or possess the land or to set

up want of title in that person, i.e. of the person who gave the licence

or the lease. That being so, it is superfluous, in this action, framed

as it is on the basis that the defendant-respondent is a licensee, to

seek a declaration of title.

As was held by the Supreme Court in Reginald Fernando v. Pubilinahamy

[2005] 1 Sri LR 31:

Where the plaintiff (licensor) established that the defendant was a

licensee, the plaintiff is entitled to take steps for ejectment of the

defendant whether or not the plaintiff was the owner of the land.

Vide also Gunasinghe v. Samarasundara [2004] 3 Sri LR 28, Dharmasiri

v. Wickrematunga [2002] 2 Sri LR 218.

In a declaration of title action which is not a rei vindicatio proper and

which is filed against a defendant such as a licensee or a tenant to recover

possession, the plaintiff need not prove title to the land against the

defendant. In such actions, the title is presumed to be with the plaintiff.

Put differently, the defendant in such actions cannot frustrate the

plaintiffs action on the basis that the plaintiff is not the owner of the

property.

The present action is not a rei vindicatio action proper but a declaration

of title action. Hence, the High Court is clearly wrong to have set aside

the judgment of the District Court on the basis that the plaintiff does not

have title to the entirety of the land but only to 11/12 shares of the land.

7

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Once the Court decides that the defendant is a licensee of the plaintiff,

and his prescriptive title is unsustainable, whether the plaintiff is the

owner of the entire land or part of it or has no title at all is irrelevant.

Can a defendant who enters into a land in a subordinate character

claim title to the land?

According to the Roman Dutch Law principles, a defendant who enters

into a land in a subordinate character such as a lessee, licensee, tenant,

mortgagee etc. cannot claim title to the land; if he wants to do so, he must

first quit the land and then fight for his rights.

Voet 19.2.32 (Voets commentary on the Pandects as translated by

Percival Gane, Butterworth & Co. (Africa) Ltd 1956, Vol. 3, at page 447)

states:

Lessee cannot dispute lessors title, tho third party can. Nor can the

setting up of an exception of ownership by the lessee stay this

restoration of the property leased, even though perhaps the proof of

ownership would be easy for the lessee. He ought in every event to

give back the possession first, and then litigate about the

proprietorship.

Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law, Vol. III, 8th Edition (1970), p.

185 states:

A lessee, as already stated, is not entitled to dispute his landlords

title, and consequently he cannot refuse to give up possession of the

property at the termination of his lease on the ground that he is

himself the rightful owner of it. His duty in such a case is first to

restore the property to the lessor and then to bring an action for a

declaration of rights.

8

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 173 Gratiaen J.

stated:

The scope of an action by a lessor against an overholding lessee for

restoration and ejectment, however, is different. Privity of contract

(whether it be by original agreement or by attornment) is the

foundation of the right to relief and issues as to title are irrelevant to

the proceedings. Indeed, a lessee who has entered into occupation

is precluded from disputing his lessors title until he has first

restored the property in fulfilment of his contractual obligation. The

lessee (conductor) cannot plead the exceptio dominii, although he

may be able easily to prove his own ownership, but he must by all

means first surrender his possession and then litigate as to

proprietorship Voet 19.2.32.

In Alvar Pillai v. Karuppan (1899) 4 NLR 321, the plaintiff sued the

defendant to recover possession of the entire land on the basis that the

term of lease had expired. The defendant refused to give up possession of

the whole land on the basis that he was the tenant under the plaintiff

only for a half of the said land. He set up a title under another person to

the other half. Although the defendant was placed in possession by the

plaintiff on the whole land, the District Judge entered judgment for the

plaintiff only for his half share. On appeal, Bonser C.J. at page 322

stated:

Now, it appears that the plaintiff can only prove title to a half of the

land. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to state the

devolution of the title, for even though the ownership of one-half of

this land were in the defendant himself, it would seem that by our

law, having been let into possession of the whole by the plaintiff, it

is not open to him to refuse to give up possession to his lessor at the

expiration of his lease. He must first give up possession, and then it

9

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

will be open to him to litigate about the ownership (see Voet XIX. 2.

32).

In Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne [1997] 1 Sri LR 197 the Court took the

same view.

In the Supreme Court case of Wimala Perera v. Kalyani Sriyalatha [2011]

1 Sri LR 182 it was held:

A lessee is not entitled to dispute his landlords title by refusing to

give up possession of the property at the termination of his lease on

the ground that he acquired certain rights to the property subsequent

to him becoming the lessee and during the period of tenancy. He

must first give up possession and then litigate about the ownership

he alleges.

However, if an action is filed for ejectment against such defendant who

originally entered into possession in a subordinate character claims

prescriptive title to the property (which is an overly onerous task) by

stating that he changed the character of possession from subordinate to

adverse by explicit overt act (as the starting point of adverse possession)

and continued such adverse possession for over 10 years as required by

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the rigidity of the said principle

can be relaxed. In such a situation, the defendant cannot be directed to

first surrender his possession in order for him to establish his

prescriptive title.

Professor G.L. Peiris in his book Law of Property in Sri Lanka, Vol. I, 2nd

Edition (1983), p.112, citing inter alia Angohamy v. Appoo (Morgans

Digest 281), Government Agent, Western Province v. Perera (1908) 11 NLR

337, Alwis v. Perera (1919) 21 NLR 321 states: The principle that an

occupation which began in a dependent or subordinate capacity can be

converted into adverse possession by an overt act or a series of acts

10

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

indicative of a challenge to the owners title, is clearly deducible from the

decided cases.

The presumption is that a person who commences his possession in a

subordinate character continues such possession in that character. In

order to show change of the character of possession, cogent and

affirmative evidence is required.

In Ran Naide v. Punchi Banda (1930) 31 NLR 478, Jayawardene A.J.

observed:

Where a person who has obtained possession of a land of another

in a subordinate character, as for example as a tenant or mortgagee,

seeks to utilize that possession as the foundation of a title by

prescription, he must show that by some overt act known to the

person under whom he possesses he has got rid of that subordinate

possession and commenced to use and occupy the property ut

dominus (Government Agent v. Ismail Lebbe (1908) 2 Weer. 29). It is

for him to show that his quasi-fiduciary position was changed by

some overt act of possession. This view was adopted by the Privy

Council in Naguda Marikar v. Mohamadu (1903) 7 N.L.R. 91) and

also by the Supreme Court in Orloff v. Grebe (1907) 10 N.L.R. 183).

In Seeman v. David [2000] 3 Sri LR 23 at 26, Weerasuriya J. stated:

It is well settled law that a person who entered property in a

subordinate character cannot claim prescriptive rights till he changes

his character by an overt act. He is not entitled to do so by forming

a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of ouster. The proof of

adverse possession is a condition precedent to the claim for

prescriptive rights.

11

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Vide also Thillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12 at 19 and Mitrapala

v. Tikonis Singho [2005] 1 Sri LR 206 at 211-212.

In the case of De Soysa v. Fonseka (1957) 58 NLR 501 at 502, Basnayake

C.J. held:

There is no evidence that the user which commenced with the leave

and licence of the owner of No. 18 was at any time converted to an

adverse user. When a user commences with leave and licence the

presumption is that its continuance rests on the permission originally

granted. Clear and unmistakable evidence of the commencement of

an adverse user thereafter for the prescribed period is necessary to

entitle the claimant to a decree in his favour. There is no such

evidence in the instant case.

In the Privy Council case of Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe Udenis de Silva

(1951) 52 NLR page 289, it was held:

If a person goes into possession of land as an agent for another,

prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that

he is holding adversely to his principal.

In Naguda Marikar v. Mohammadu (1898) 7 NLR 91, the Privy Council

held that in the absence of any evidence to show that the plaintiff had got

rid of his character of agent, he was not entitled to the benefit of section

3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

In the case of Navaratne v. Jayatunge (1943) 44 NLR 517, Howard C.J.

remarked:

The defendant entered into possession of the lands in dispute with

the consent and the permission of the owner. Being a licensee, she

cannot get rid of this character unless she does some overt act

showing an intention to possess adversely.

12

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In a more recent of Ameen and Another v. Ammavasi Ramu

(SC/APPEAL/232/2017, SC Minutes of 22.01.2019), one of the questions

to be decided was whether the defendant who was a licensee was entitled

to put forward a plea of prescription. De Abrew A.C.J. (with M.N.B.

Fernando J. and Amarasekera J. agreeing) stated:

When a person starts possessing an immovable property with leave

and licence of the owner, the presumption is that he continues to

possess the immovable property on the permission originally granted

and such a person or his agents or heirs cannot claim prescriptive

title against the owner or his heirs on the basis of the period he

possessed the property.

The defendant is a trespasser

Admittedly, the plaintiff in the instant action, having 11/12 shares in the

land, is a co-owner of the land described in the first schedule to the

plaint, whereas the defendant, having failed his prescriptive claim to a

portion of the land, has no rights in the land. The defendant is a

trespasser.

A co-owner can sue a trespasser

A co-owner can sue a trespasser to have his title to the undivided share

declared and for ejectment of the trespasser from the whole land.

In the leading case of Hevawitarane v. Dangan Rubber Co. Ltd. (1913) 17

NLR 49 at 53 Wood Renton A.C.J. declared:

Any co-owner, or party claiming under such a co-owner, is entitled

to eject a trespasser from the whole of the common property. (Unus

Lebbe v. Zayee (1893) 3 SCR 56, Greta v. Fernando (1905) 4 Bal.

100) Moreover, prima facie evidence of title is all that is required in

such an action.

13

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

It may be noted that, when it comes to a trespasser, Wood Renton A.C.J.

remarked that prima facie evidence of title is all that is required in such

an action. In the same case, Pereira J. stated at page 55:

As regards the rights of owners of undivided shares of land to sue

trespassers, I have always understood the law, both before and

after the coming into operation of the Civil Procedure Code, to be that

the owner of an undivided share of land might sue a trespasser to

have his title to the undivided share declared and for ejectment of

the trespasser from the whole land, the reason for this latter right

being that the owner of the undivided share has an interest in every

part and portion of the entire land (see section 12, Civil Procedure

Code; Unus Lebbe v. Zayee (1893) 3 SCR 56; Greta v. Fernando

(1905) 4 Bal. 100; Arnolisa v. Dissan 4 NLR 163).

In Hariette v. Pathmasiri [1996] 1 Sri LR 358 at 362 and Attanayake v.

Ramyawathie [2003] 1 Sri LR 401 at 403 the Supreme Court quoted the

said principle of law with approval. This was reiterated in several

decisions including Rosalin Hami v. Hewage Hami and Others

(SC/APPEAL/15/2008, SC Minutes of 03.12.2010) and Punchiappuhamy

v. Dingiribanda (SC/APPEAL/4/2010, SC Minutes of 02.11.2015).

The greater includes the less

In the impugned judgment of the High Court, the High Court refers to

Hevawitarane v. Dangan Rubber Co. Ltd. (supra) to reiterate the well-

settled law that a co-owner can sue a trespasser to have his title to the

undivided share declared and for ejectment of the trespasser from the

whole land but refuses to apply this principle in this action stating that

the plaintiff filed the action seeking a declaration of title to the entire

land. This is a wrong approach.

14

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Firstly, a careful reading of the prayer to the plaint will reveal that the

plaintiff filed this action seeking a declaration of the plaintiffs title to the

land and not seeking a declaration of title to the entire land. ( 02

)

Secondly, even if the plaintiff sought a declaration of title to the entire

land, if the Court finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to the entire land

but only to a portion of it, the Court need not dismiss the plaintiffs action

in toto.

It is a recognised principle that when a plaintiff has asked for a greater

relief than he is entitled to, it should not prevent him from getting the

lesser relief which he is actually entitled to. Non debet cui plus licet quod

minus est non licere, also known as, Cui licet quod majus non debet quod

minus est non licere: the greater includes the less. This is a well-

established principle in law and also in consonance with common sense.

Vide King v. Kalu Banda (1912) 15 NLR 422 at 427, Rodrigo v. Abdul

Rahman (1935) 37 NLR 298 at 299, Police Sergeant, Hambantota v. Simon

Silva (1939) 40 NLR 534 at 538, Ibealebbe v. The Queen (1963) 65 NLR

433 at 435, Abeynayake v. Lt. Gen. Rohan Daluwatte and Others [1998]

2 Sri LR 47 at 55, Bulankulama and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of

Industrial Development and Others [2000] 3 Sri LR 243 at 260-261,

Attanayake v. Ramyawathie [2003] 1 Sri LR 401 at 409.

In rei vindicatio actions, defendants tend to rely on Hariette v. Pathmasiri

(supra) to argue that when a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action seeks a

declaration of title to the entire land, his action must fail if he fails to

prove that he is the sole owner of the entire land. This is a

misinterpretation of the judgment. In Hariettes case the Supreme Court

at pages 362-363 held as follows:

15

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

However, it has to be borne in mind that our law recognizes the right

of a co-owner to sue a trespasser to have his title to an undivided

share declared and for ejectment of the trespasser from the whole

land. In the case of Hevawitarana v. Dangan Rubber Co. Ltd 17 NLR

44 at 55, Pereira, J. stated as follows:-

I have always understood the law, both before and after the coming

into operation of the Civil Procedure Code, to be that the owner of an

undivided share of land might sue a trespasser to have his title to

the undivided share declared and for ejectment of the trespasser

from the whole land, the reason for this latter right being that the

owner of the undivided share has an interest in every part and

portion of the entire land.

In this case the Plaintiff is not seeking a declaration of title to her

undivided share in the land described in schedule 1 and for the

ejectment of the Defendant from that land. She has pleaded that she

possessed the land described in schedule 2 for and in lieu of her

undivided share and seeks the ejectment of the Defendant from that

land. Therefore the case for the Plaintiff cannot stop at adducing

evidence of paper title to an undivided share. It was her burden to

adduce evidence of exclusive possession and the acquisition of

prescriptive title by ouster in respect of the smaller land described in

schedule 2.

Since the prescriptive title to schedule 2 has not been proved by the

plaintiff, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal

and dismissed the appeal.

If I may repeat for emphasis, in Hariettes case the plaintiff sought to eject

the defendant from the portion of land described in the second schedule

to the plaint (which was part of the larger land described in the first

16

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

schedule to the plaint) on the basis that she possessed the portion of the

land described in the second schedule to the plaint in lieu of her

undivided shares described in the first schedule to the plaint. The

Supreme Court held that the plaintiff failed to establish that she acquired

prescriptive title to that portion of land by ouster and therefore the

plaintiffs action cannot succeed.

Hariettes case was followed by the Supreme Court in Attanayake v.

Ramyawathie [2003] 1 Sri LR 401 where facts were similar. The Supreme

Court at page 403 summarised the issue in that case in the following

manner:

It was agreed by both counsel at the hearing, that the only issue

that has to be gone into is whether a co-owner of a land who sues

a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment is entitled to

maintain the action if he instituted action as the sole owner of the

premises.

This question was answered emphatically in the affirmative.

Bandaranayake J. (later C.J.) stated at page 409:

I am of the firm view that, if an appellant had asked for a greater relief

than he is entitled to, the mere claim for a greater share in the land

should not prevent him, having a judgment in his favour for a lesser

share in the land. A claim for a greater relief than entitled to should

not prevent an appellant from getting a lesser relief. However, it is

necessary that the appellant adduces evidence of ownership for the

portion of land he is claiming for a declaration of title. It is amply clear

that the appellant in the instant case has not been able to adduce such

evidence.

In such circumstances the question raised by the counsel for the

appellant is answered in the following terms. A co-owner of a land who

17

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

sues a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment is entitled to

maintain the action even if he instituted the action as the sole owner of

the land and premises. The fact that an appellant has asked for greater

relief than he is entitled to, should not prevent him from getting the

lesser relief which he is entitled to.

However, as in Attanayakes case, the Supreme Court was not inclined to

grant relief to the plaintiff-appellant because the plaintiff failed to prove

that he was entitled to the land described in schedule B to the plaint. The

reason was that the plaintiff sought a declaration of title and ejectment of

the defendant from the land described in schedule B to the plaint.

The facts in the present case are very much similar to that of

Harriettes case. As referred to earlier in the instant case the

appellant (the original plaintiff) had instituted action in the District

Court for a declaration of title and for ejectment from the land

morefully described in the Schedule B to the plaint of the respondent

therefrom. [page 406] However, it is necessary that the appellant

adduces evidence of ownership for the portion of land he is claiming

for a declaration of title. It is amply clear that the appellant in the

instant case has not been able to adduce such evidence. [page 409]

These two judgments (Hariette v. Pathmasiri and Attanayake v.

Ramyawathie) unequivocally admit that a co-owner is entitled to:

(a) file an action seeking a declaration to his undivided rights of the land

and ejectment of a trespasser from the whole land; and

(b) successfully sue a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment

notwithstanding that he instituted the action as the sole owner of

the premises. This latter entitlement is based on the common-

sense principle that the greater includes the less.

18

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

If a co-owner of a land as the plaintiff can successfully sue a trespasser

for ejectment from the whole land notwithstanding that he initially

instituted the action as the sole owner of the land based on the common-

sense principle that the greater includes the less, the plaintiffs action in

my view cannot and should not be dismissed if he seeks to eject a

trespasser from an identified portion of the whole land on the basis that

he filed the action as the sole owner of the identified portion of the land

but he is in fact a co-owner of that identified portion of the land. In such

an event, the Court can declare that the plaintiff is a co-owner of the

whole land or of that identified portion of the land and eject the trespasser

on that basis.

Why reluctant to apply the greater includes the less?

Two main reasons why some judges and lawyers think that the general

principle the greater includes the less is inapplicable in rei vindicatio

actions seem to be:

(a) No Court can grant relief to a party what has not been prayed for

in the prayer to the pleadings. In other words, the Court can grant

reliefs only in the manner prayed for in the prayer to the pleadings

(plaint/answer/replication etc) neither more nor less.

(b) In a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff must prove title of the

property strictly in the exact manner pleaded in the plaint.

Can the Court grant relief not prayed for in the pleadings?

The popular view that no Court can grant relief what has not been prayed

for in the prayer to the pleadings (Surangi v. Rodrigo [2003] 3 Sri LR 35,

Sopi Nona v. Karunadasa [2005] 3 Sri LR 237) is not an absolute rule of

law.

19

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Even if a particular relief has not been prayed for in the prayer to the

pleadings, if it has been raised as an issue that has been accepted by

Court, the Court cannot refuse to grant the relief on the basis that it has

not been prayed for in the prayer to the pleadings.

A case is not tried on the pleadings or on the reliefs as prayed for in the

prayer to the pleadings but on issues raised and accepted by Court on

which the right decision of the case appears to Court to depend. Once

issues are raised and accepted by Court the pleadings (which include

reliefs prayed) have no place; they recede to the background. Hence, what

has been prayed for in the prayer to the pleadings is not decisive. Vide

Hanaffi v. Nallamma [1998] 1 Sri LR 73 at 77, Dharmasiri v.

Wickrematunga [2002] 2 Sri LR 218, Gunasinghe v. Samarasundara

[2004] 3 Sri LR 28, Kulatunga v. Ranaweera [2005] 2 Sri LR 197, Peiris

v. Siripala [2009] 1 Sri LR 75 at 78.

In Begum Sabiha Sultan v. Nawab Mohd. Mansur Ali Khan & Ors (Appeal

Civil 1921 of 2007 decided on 12.04.2007), the Supreme Court of India

stated:

There is no doubt that at the stage of consideration of the return of

the plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code, what is to be looked

into is the plaint and the averments therein. At the same time, it is

also necessary to read the plaint in a meaningful manner to find out

the real intention behind the suit. In Messrs Moolji Jaitha & Co. Vs.

The Khandesh Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. [A.I.R. 1950

Federal Court 83], the Federal Court observed that: The nature of

the suit and its purpose have to be determined by reading the plaint

as a whole.

It was further observed:

20

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

The inclusion or absence of a prayer is not decisive of the true

nature of the suit, nor is the order in which the prayers are arrayed

in the plaint. The substance or object of the suit has to be gathered

from the averments made in the plaint and on which the reliefs

asked in the prayers are based.

It was further observed:

It must be borne in mind that the function of a pleading is only to

state material facts and it is for the court to determine the legal result

of those facts and to mould the relief in accordance with that result.

This position was reiterated by this Court in T. Arivandandam Vs.

T.V. Satyapal & Anr. (1978) 1 S.C.R. 742 by stating that what was

called for was a meaningful not formal reading of the plaint and

any illusion created by clever drafting of the plaint should be buried

then and there.

In the Supreme Court case of Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka

[1989] 2 Sri LR 95 at 100, Kulatunga J. observed: The law does not

require that the plaint should make out a prima facie case which is what

the defendants-appellants appear to insist on, nor are the plaintiffs

required to state their evidence by which the claim would be proved.

In Jane Nona v. Padmakumara [2003] 2 Sri LR 118 the question was

whether the Court can grant relief for ejectment when there was no such

specific relief prayed for in the prayer to the plaint. The Court answered

this in the affirmative on the basis that when the plaintiff averred in the

body of the plaint that a cause of action has accrued to him to obtain an

order of peaceful possession of the land and damages, and prayed that

he be granted damages until possession is restored to him, it is implicit

that the plaintiff seeks ejectment as well.

21

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In Weerasinghe v. Heling and Others (SC/APPEAL/91/2013, SC Minutes

of 26.02.2020) the question was whether the plaintiff could seek

ejectment of the defendants from the land in suit without a specific prayer

for declaration of title. This Court answered it in the affirmative. De Abrew

J. citing with approval Jayasinghe v. Tikiri Banda [1988] 2 CALR 24,

Dharmasiri v. Wickramatunga [2002] 2 Sri LR 218 and Pathirana v.

Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 held in an action for ejectment of the

defendant from the property in dispute, once the plaintiffs title to the

property is proved, he (the plaintiff) is entitled to ask for ejectment of the

defendant from the property even though there is no prayer in the plaint

for a declaration of title.

In Jayasinghe v. Tikiri Banda [1988] 2 CALR 24 Viknaraja J. held where

title to the property has been proved, as in this case the fact that one had

failed to ask for a declaration of title to the property will not prevent one

from claiming the relief of ejectment.

What is important is whether the relief has been sought in the pleadings

and not whether the relief has been sought in the prayer to the pleadings.

In Dharmasiri v. Wickramatunga [2002] 2 Sri LR 218 the plaintiff sought

ejectment of the defendant but there was no prayer for a declaration of

title. However the Court held that the absence of a specific prayer for a

declaration of title causes no prejudice if the title is pleaded in the body

of the plaint and issues are framed and accepted by Court on the title so

pleaded.

In Charlot Nona v. Kuruppu (SC/APPEAL/54/2011, SC Minutes of

17.06.2015), the High Court had dismissed the application for leave to

appeal on the basis that in the prayer to the petition there was no such

relief sought. On appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of

the High Court holding that the absence of a specific prayer for leave to

22

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

appeal cannot be considered as a ground for dismissal of an application

for leave to appeal when such petition contains a statement in the body

of the petition moving the Court to grant leave to appeal.

This position can also be defended from a different point of view.

Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law, Vol II, 8th Edition (1960), p.

27) states the rights of an owner are comprised under three heads,

namely, (1) the right of possession and the right to recover possession; (2)

the right of use and enjoyment; and (3) the right of disposition. He goes on

to say that these three factors are all essential to the idea of ownership

but need not all be present in an equal degree at one and the same time.

As stated in K.J. Aiyars Judicial Dictionary, 11th Edition (1995), page

833, it is not possible to give a comprehensive definition to the rights of

ownership. Traditionally, those rights include:

Jus utendi the right to use of the thing

Jus possidendi the right to possess a thing

Jus abutendi the right to consume or destroy a thing

Jus despondendi vei transferendi the right to dispose of a thing

or to transfer it as by sale, gift, exchange etc.

Jus sibi habendi the right to hold a thing for oneself

Jus alteri non habendi or Jus prohibendi the right to exclude

others from its use

In a rei vindicatio action, if the Court holds with the plaintiff, the Court

accepts that he is the owner of the property. The owner of the property

has the inherent right to possess the property. In other words, the right

to possession is an essential attribute of ownership. Hence the plaintiff

automatically gets the entitlement to the right to possession whether or

not he has prayed for ejectment in the prayer to the plaint once the Court

23

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

decides that he is the owner of the property. Vide Kamalawathie v.

Premarathne (SC/APPEAL/118/2018, SC Minutes of 2.6.2021).

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172 Gratiaen J. held

In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery of the

property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful occupation.

Let me also add that even if an issue or issues have not been raised using

the real legal terms, if the issue or issues raised in fact cover the situation

intended by the legal terms, the Court cannot be found fault with for

granting the relief using the legal term. In Pushpakumara v. Marmet

[2003] 2 Sri LR 244 the District Court inter alia granted divorce on the

ground of malicious desertion despite there being no issue framed on

malicious desertion. When this matter was raised on appeal, the finding

was upheld on the basis that Despite the fact that the legal term malicious

desertion is not referred to in the said issue however the issue raises the

factual question as to whether the 1st defendant-respondents conduct

amounted to constructive malicious desertion.

As has been stated by Suresh Chandra J. in the case of Elias v.

Gajasinghe (SC/APPEAL/50/08, SC Minutes of 28.06.2011):

For the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections

should be discouraged and parties should be encouraged to seek

justice by dealing with the merits of cases. Raising of such technical

objections and dealing with them and the subsequent challenges on

them to the superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to

the delay and the backlog of cases pending in Courts. Very often the

dealing of such technicalities become only an academic exercise with

which the litigants would not be interested. The delay in

dispensation of justice can be minimized if parties are discouraged

24

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

from taking up technical objections which takes up valuable judicial

time. What is important for litigants would be their aspiration to get

justice from courts on merits rather than on technicalities. As has

often been quoted it must be remembered that Courts of law are

Courts of justice and not academies of law.

Courts should not be swayed by high-flown technical objections in meting

out substantive justice to litigants unless such objections shatter the very

foundation of the case.

In a rei vindicatio action: Who has the onus of proof?

What is the standard of proof?

Is strict proof of title in the manner

pleaded in the plaint necessary?

The High Court states that since this is a declaration of title action, the

plaintiff must prove title to the land in the manner she has pleaded in the

plaint.

As I have already adverted to, there is a distinction between a rei

vindicatio action proper and a declaration of title action. The present

action is not a rei vindicatio action proper but a declaration of title action.

The distinction between the two was lucidly explained by Gratian J. in

Pathirana v. Jayasundara (supra) at 172-173:

In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery

of the property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful

occupation. The plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the very

essence of the action. Maasdorps Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96.

The scope of an action by a lessor against an overholding lessee for

restoration and ejectment, however, is different. Privity of contract

25

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

(whether it be by original agreement or by attornment) is the

foundation of the right to relief and issues as to title are irrelevant to

the proceedings. Indeed, a lessee who has entered into occupation

is precluded from disputing his lessors title until he has first

restored the property in fulfilment of his contractual obligation. The

lessee (conductor) cannot plead the exceptio dominii, although he

may be able easily to prove his own ownership, but he must by all

means first surrender his possession and then litigate as to

proprietorship Voet 19.2.32.

Both these forms of action referred to are no doubt designed to

secure the same primary relief, namely, the recovery of property. But

the cause of action in one case is the violation of the plaintiff's rights

of ownership, in the other it is the breach of the lessees contractual

obligation.

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way

of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in

truth an action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding

tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the

declaration is based on proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of

the contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the lessor is

the true owner.

Even if this is a rei vindicatio action proper, there is no necessity to prove

the title of the plaintiff exactly in the same manner which the plaintiff has

pleaded in the plaint. For instance, if the plaintiff in the plaint pleads title

relying on one deed but at the trial marks several other deeds and

documents (duly listed) to fortify his case, the Court should not disregard

such deeds/documents and mechanically dismiss the plaintiffs action

on the basis that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action must prove title

strictly in the same manner which he has pleaded in the plaint.

26

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Even in a criminal case or a partition case such stringent procedure is

not adopted. This does not mean that a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action

can present a different case at the trial from what he has pleaded in his

pleadings. Suffice it to say, even that is possible, if issues are raised in

that direction and accepted by Court, for the case is tried not on

pleadings but on issues.

The burden of proof and the standard of proof in rei vindicatio actions are

overwhelmingly overshadowed by misinterpretations, misconstructions

and misunderstandings. Let me elaborate on this as significant portion

of the District Court work is on rei vindicatio/declaration of title actions.

In order to succeed in a rei vindicatio action, first and foremost, the

plaintiff shall prove his ownership to the property. If he fails to prove it,

his action shall fail. This principle is based on the Latin maxim onus

probandi incumbit ei qui agit, which means, the burden of proof lies with

the person who brings the action. Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance

is also to a similar effect.

Macdonell C.J. in De Silva v. Goonetilleke (1960) 32 NLR 217 at

219 stated:

There is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration of

title must have title himself. To bring the action rei vindicatio

plaintiff must have ownership actually vested in him. (1 Nathan p.

362, s. 593.) ... The authorities unite in holding that plaintiff must

show title to the corpus in dispute and that if he cannot, the action

will not lie.

In Pathirana v. Jayasundera (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172, Gratiaen J.

declared:

27

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

The plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the very essence of the

action. Maasdorps Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96.

In Mansil v. Devaya [1985] 2 Sri LR 46, G.P.S. De Silva J. (later C.J.)

stated at 51:

In a rei vindicatio action, on the other hand, ownership is of the

essence of the action; the action is founded on ownership.

In Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 352, Marsoof J. held:

An important feature of the actio rei vindicatio is that it has to

necessarily fail if the plaintiff cannot clearly establish his title.

Having said the above, it needs to be emphasised that the plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action has no heavier burden to discharge than a plaintiff

in any other civil action. The standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action is

on a balance of probabilities.

Professor George Wille, in his monumental work Willes Principles of

South African Law, 9th Edition (2007), states at page 539:

To succeed with the rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a

balance of probabilities, first, his or her ownership in the property.

If a movable is sought to be recovered, the owner must rebut the

presumption that the possessor of the movable is the owner thereof.

In the case of immovables, it is sufficient as a rule to show that title

in the land is registered in his or her name. Secondly, the property

must exist, be clearly identifiable and must not have been destroyed

or consumed. Money, in the form of coins and banknotes, is not

easily identifiable and thus not easily vindicable. Thirdly, the

defendant must be in possession or detention of the thing at the

moment the action is instituted. The rationale is to ensure that the

defendant is in a position to comply with an order for restoration.

28

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In Preethi Anura v. William Silva (SC/APPEAL/116/2014, SC Minutes of

05.06.2017), the plaintiff filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendant seeking a declaration of title to the land in suit and the

ejectment of the defendant therefrom. The District Court held with the

plaintiff but the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court on the basis that the plaintiff failed to prove title of the

land. The plaintiffs title commenced with a statutory determination made

under section 19 of the Land Reform Law in favour of his grandmother,

who had bequeathed the land by way of a last will to the plaintiff, with

the land being later conveyed to the plaintiff by way of an executors

conveyance. No documentary evidence was tendered to establish that the

last will was proved in Court and admitted to probate in order to validate

the said executors conveyance. The District Court was satisfied that the

said factors were proved by oral evidence but the High Court found the

same insufficient to discharge the burden that rests upon a plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action, which the High Court considered to be very heavy.

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the High Court and restored

the judgment of the District Court, taking the view that the plaintiff had

proved title to the land despite the purported shortcomings. In the course

of the judgment, Dep C.J. (with De Abrew J. and Jayawardena J.

agreeing) remarked:

In a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff has to establish the title to the

land. Plaintiff need not establish the title with mathematical

precision nor to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt as in a

criminal case. The plaintiffs task is to establish the case on a

balance of probability. In a partition case the situation is different as

it is an action in rem and the trial judge is required to carefully

examine the title and the devolution of title. This case being a rei

vindicatio action this court has to consider whether the plaintiff

discharged the burden on balance of probability.

29

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

What is the degree of proof expected when the standard of proof is on a

balance of probabilities? This is better understood when proof on a

balance of probabilities is compared with proof on beyond a reasonable

doubt.

On proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in Miller v. Minister of Pensions

[1947] 2 All ER 372, Lord Denning declared at 373:

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the

shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote

possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence

of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case is

proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

In relation to proof on a balance of probabilities, it was stated at 374:

That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of

probability, but not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the

evidence is such that the tribunal can say: We think it more

probable than not, the burden is discharged, but, if the probabilities

are equal, it is not.

In consideration of the degree of proof in a rei vindicatio action, we

invariably refer to the seminal judgment of Pathirana v. Jayasundara

(1955) 58 NLR 169. In that case the plaintiff sued the defendant on the

basis that the defendant was an overholding lessee. The defendant

admitted the bare execution of the lease but stated that the lessors were

unable to give him possession of the land. He averred that the land was

sold to him by its lawful owner (not one of the lessors) and that by adverse

possession from that date he had acquired title by prescription. The

30

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

plaintiff then sought to amend the plaint by claiming a declaration of title

and ejectment on the footing that his rights of ownership had been

violated. The Supreme Court held:

A lessor of property who institutes action on the basis of a cause of

action arising from a breach by the defendant of his contractual

obligation as lessee is not entitled to amend his plaint subsequently

so as to alter the nature of the proceeding to an action rei vindicatio

if such a course would prevent or prejudice the setting up by the

defendant of a plea of prescriptive title.

In the course of the judgment the Court distinguished an action for

declaration of title (based on the contractual relationship between the

plaintiff and the defendant) from an action rei vindicatio proper. In

general terms, in both actions, a declaration of title is sought in the

former, as a matter of course, without strict proof of title, but in the latter,

as a peremptory requirement, with strict proof of title. H.N.G. Fernando

J. (later C.J.) at page 171 explained the distinction between the two in

this way:

There is however the further point that the plaintiff in his prayer

sought not only ejectment but also a declaration of title, a prayer for

which latter relief is probably unusual in an action against an

overholding tenant. I have no doubt that it is open to a lessor in an

action for ejectment to ask for a declaration of title, but the question

of difficulty arises is whether the action thereby becomes a rei

vindicatio for which strict proof of the plaintiff's title would be

required, or else is merely one for a declaration (without strict proof)

of a title which the tenant by law precluded from denying. If the

essential element of a rei vindicatio is that the right of ownership

must be strictly proved, it is difficult to accept the proposition that an

action in which the plaintiff can automatically obtain a declaration

31

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

of title through the operation of a rule in estoppel should be regarded

as a vindicatory action. The fact that the person in possession of

property originally held as lessee would not preclude the lessor-

owner from choosing to proceed against him by a rei vindicatio. But

this choice can I think be properly exercised only by clearly setting

out the claim of title and sounding in delict.

The term strict proof of the plaintiffs title used here does not mean that

the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove title beyond a reasonable

doubt or a very high degree of proof. The term strict proof of the plaintiffs

title was used here to distinguish the standard of proof between a

declaration of title action based on a contractual relationship between

the plaintiff and the defendant such as lessor and lessee, and a rei

vindicatio action proper based on ownership of the property. In a rei

vindicatio action, if the plaintiff proves on a balance of probabilities that

he is the owner, he must succeed.

Professor G.L. Peiris, in his treatise Law of Property in Sri Lanka, Vol I,

makes it clear at page 304:

It must be emphasized, however, that the observations in these

cases to the effect that the plaintiffs title must be strictly proved in

a rei vindicatio, cannot be accepted as containing the implication that

a standard of exceptional stringency applies in this context. An

extremely exacting standard is insisted upon in certain categories of

action such as partition actions. It is clear that a standard

characterized by this degree of severity does not apply to the proof

of a plaintiffs title in a rei vindicatory action.

(Justice) Dr. H.W. Tambiah opines in Survey of Laws Controlling

Ownership of Lands in Sri Lanka, Vol 2, International Property

Investment Journal 217 at pages 243-244:

32

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In a vindicatory action, the plaintiff must prove that he is the owner

of the property which is in the possession of the defendant. See de

Silva v. Gunathilleke, 32 N.L.R. 217 (1931); Abeykoon Hamine v.

Appuhamy, 52 N.L.R. 49 (1951); Muthusamy v. Seneviratne, 31

C.L.W. 91 (1946). Once title is established, the burden shifts to the

defendant to prove that by adverse possession for a period of 10

years he has acquired prescriptive title. Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva,

52 N.L.R. 289 (1951). In rei vindicatory action once the plaintiff

proves he was in possession but then he was evicted by the

defendant, the burden of proving title will shift to the defendant. In

Kathiramathamby v. Arumugam 38 C.L.W. 27 (1948) it was held

that if the plaintiff alleges that he was forcibly ousted by the

defendant the burden of proving ouster remains with the

complainant. As a practical matter, the burden of proof in a rei

vindicatio action is not burdensome. The plaintiff must prove only

that he is the probable owner of the property.

The view of Dr. Tambiah As a practical matter, the burden of proof in a

rei vindicatio action is not burdensome. The plaintiff must prove only that

he is the probable owner of the property shall be understood in the

context of his view expressed at the outset that In a vindicatory action,

the plaintiff must prove that he is the owner of the property which is in the

possession of the defendant.

The recent South African case of Huawei Technologies South Africa (Pty)

Limited v. Redefine Properties Limited and Another [2018] ZAGPJHC 403

decided on 29.05.2018 reveals that the burden of proof of a plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action is not unusually onerous. In this case it was held

that what the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action needs to prove is that he

is the owner of the property (which the Court stated could be done by

producing his title deed) and that the defendant is holding or in

33

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

possession of the property. Once this is done, the onus shifts to the

defendant to establish a right to continue to hold against the owner. Cele

J. declared:

The rei vindicatio is the common law real action for the protection of

ownership. C.P. Smith, Eviction and Rental Claims: A Practical Guide

at p. 1-2; Graham v. Ridley 1931 TPD 476; Chetty v Naidoo 1974 (3)

SA 13 (A). It is inherent in the nature of ownership that possession

of the res should normally be with the owner and it follows that no

other person may withhold it from the owner unless he or she is

vested with some right enforceable against the owner. The owner, in

instituting a rei vindicatio, need do no more than allege and prove

that he is the owner and that the defendant is holding or in

possession of the res. The onus is on the Defendant to allege and

establish a right to continue to hold against the owner. Chetty v.

Naidoo (supra) at 20 AE. A court does not have an equitable

discretion to refuse an order for ejectment on the grounds of equity

and fairness. Belmont House v. Gore NNO 2011 (6) SA 173 (WCC) at

para [15]. In the case of eviction based on an owners rei vindicatio,

the owner has only to prove his ownership which can be done by

producing his title deed indicating that the property is registered in

his name. Goudini Chrome (Pty) Ltd v. MCC Contracts (Pty) Ltd [1999]

ZASCA 208; 1993 (1) SA 77 (A) at 82 AC.

The requirement of proof of chain of title which is the norm in a partition

action is not applicable in a rei vindicatio action.

This view was expressed by Professor Wille (op. cit. at page 539) when he

stated that In the case of immovables, it is sufficient as a rule to show

that title in the land is registered in his or her name.

34

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

When the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, the Court is

entitled to consider whose version the plaintiffs or the defendants is

more probable.

Banda v. Soyza [1998] 1 Sri LR 255 is a rei vindicatio action filed by a

trustee of a temple seeking a declaration of title, the ejectment of the

defendant and damages. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of

the District Court and the plaintiffs action was dismissed on the ground

that the plaintiff had failed to establish title to the subject matter of the

action or even to identify the land in suit. But the Supreme Court set

aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restored the judgment of

the District Court on the basis that there was sufficient evidence led on

behalf of the plaintiff to prove the title and the identity of the lots in

dispute. G.P.S. de Silva C.J. laid down at page 259 the criterion to be

adopted in a rei vindicatio action in respect of the standard of proof in the

following manner:

In a case such as this, the true question that a court has to consider

on the question of title is, who has the superior title? The answer

has to be reached upon a consideration of the totality of the evidence

led in the case.

Dr. H.W. Tambiah (op. cit. at p. 244) refers to proof of superior title by

the defendant as a defence to a rei vindicatio action.

In a vindicatory action, the defendant has numerous defenses,

which include: denial of the plaintiffs title; establishment of his own

title, in the sense of establishing a title superior to that of the plaintiff;

prescription; a plea of res judicata; right of tenure under the plaintiff

for example usufruct, pledge or lease of land; the right to retain

possession subject to an indemnity from the plaintiff under peculiar

conditions; a plea of exception rei venditae et traditae; and, ius tertii.

35

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Jinawathie v. Emalin Perera

[1986] 2 Sri LR 121 adverted to superior title and sufficient title and

held that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove that he has title

to the disputed property and that such title is superior to the title, if any,

put forward by the defendant, or that he has sufficient title which he can

vindicate against the defendant.

The plaintiff in Jinawathies case filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendants relying upon a statutory determination made under section

19 of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972. The defendants sought the

dismissal of the plaintiffs action on the basis that the alleged statutory

determination did not convey any title on the plaintiff and that in the

absence of the plaintiff demonstrating dominium over the land, the

plaintiffs action shall fail. Both the District Court and the Court of

Appeal held with the plaintiff and the Supreme Court affirmed it.

Ranasinghe J. (later C.J.) with the agreement of Sharvananda C.J.,

Wanasundera J., Atukorale J., and Tambiah J., whilst emphasising that

in a rei vindicatio action proper, the plaintiffs ownership of the land is of

the very essence of the action, expressed the view of the Supreme Court

in the following terms at page 142:

This principle was re-affirmed once again by Gratiaen J. in the case

of Palisena v. Perera (1954) 56 NLR 407 where the plaintiff came

into court to vindicate his title based upon a permit issued under the

provisions of the Land Development Ordinance (Chap. 320). In giving

judgment for the plaintiff, Gratiaen, J. said: a permit-holder who

has complied with the conditions of his permit enjoys, during the

period for which the permit is valid, a sufficient title which he can

vindicate against a trespasser in civil proceedings. The fact that the

alleged trespasser had prevented him from entering upon the land

does not afford a defence to the action.

36

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

In a vindicatory action the plaintiff must himself have title to the

property in dispute: the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he

has title to the disputed property, and that such title is superior to

the title, if any, put forward by the defendant in occupation. The

plaintiff can and must succeed only on the strength of his own title,

and not upon the weakness of the defence.

On a consideration of the foregoing principles relating to the legal

concept of ownership, and to an action rei vindicatio it seems to me

that the plaintiff-respondent did, at the time of the institution of these

proceedings, have, by virtue of P6 [statutory determination],

sufficient title which she could have vindicated against the

defendants-appellants in proceedings such as these.

In the Supreme Court case of Khan v. Jayman [1994] 2 Sri LR 233 the

plaintiff sued the defendant for ejectment from the premises in suit and

damages on the basis that the defendant was in forcible occupation of

the premises after the termination of the leave and licence given to the

defendant. The defendant claimed tenancy. The District Court dismissed

the plaintiffs action on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish that

the defendant was a licensee and the Court of Appeal affirmed it. On

appeal, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff shall succeed since the

defendant failed to establish a better title to the property after the

plaintiff established his title and the defendant in his evidence admitted

the plaintiffs title. Kulatunga J. with the agreement of G.P.S. De Silva

C.J. and Wadugodapitiya J. stated at page 235:

The plaintiff did not pray for a declaration of title or raise an issue

on ownership, presumably because no challenge to his ownership

was anticipated. Indeed the defendants answer did not deny the

plaintiffs title. At the trial, the plaintiff established his title and the

defendant in his evidence admitted the plaintiff's title to the premises

37

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

in suit. This action is, therefore, a vindicatory action i.e. an action

founded on ownership. Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law

Vol. II Eighth Edition page 70 commenting on the right of an owner

to recover possession of his property states

The plaintiff's ownership in the thing is the very essence of such an

action and will have to be both alleged and proved

He also states

The ownership of a thing consists in the exclusive rights of

possession and in the absence of any agreement or other legal

restriction to the contrary, it entitles the owner to claim possession

from anyone who cannot set up a better title to it and warn him off

the property, and eject him from it.

The argument of the defendant that he was prejudiced in his defence as

the plaintiff did not sue the defendant as the owner of the premises was

rejected by the Supreme Court. Kulatunga J. stated at 239:

Learned Counsel for the defendant-respondent also submitted that

in view of the fact that this was not a case of the plaintiff suing as

owner simpliciter and in the absence of an issue on ownership, the

defendant would not have known the case he had to meet and was

prejudiced in his defence. I cannot agree. As stated early in this

judgment, the plaintiff pleaded his ownership and clearly set out his

case, including the fact that the defendant was in occupation of a

room of the premises in suit by leave and licence. The defendant too

set out his case in unambiguous terms viz. that he was a protected

tenant from 1971. In the end, the plaintiff proved his case whilst the

defendant failed to establish a better title to the property. As such,

the question of prejudice does not arise.

38

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

When the paper title to the property is admitted or proved to be in the

plaintiff, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove on what right he is

in possession of the property.

In Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva (1951) 52 NLR 289 the Privy Council held:

In an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal title

is in the plaintiff but the property is in the possession of the

defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant.

In Theivandran v. Ramanathan Chettiar [1986] 2 Sri LR 219 at 222,

Sharvananda C.J. stated:

In a vindicatory action the claimant need merely prove two facts;

namely, that he is the owner of the thing and that the thing to which

he is entitled to possession by virtue of his ownership is in the

possession of the defendant. Basing his claim on his ownership,

which entitles him to possession, he may sue for the ejectment of

any person in possession of it without his consent. Hence when the

legal title to the premises is admitted or proved to be in the plaintiff,

the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he is in lawful

possession.

This was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva C.J. in Beebi Johara v.

Warusavithana [1998] 3 Sri LR 227 at 229 and reiterated in Candappa

nee Bastian v. Ponnambalam Pillai [1993] 1 Sri LR 184 at 187. Vide also

Wijetunge v. Thangarajah [1999] 1 Sri LR 53, Gunasekera v. Latiff [1999]

1 Sri LR 365 at 370, Jayasekera v. Bishop of Kandy [2002] 2 Sri LR 406

and Loku Menika v. Gunasekara [1997] 2 Sri LR 281 at 282-283.

In general, in a rei vindicatio action the plaintiffs case is based on his

paper title whereas the defendants case is based on prescriptive title.

Prescriptive title necessarily commences and continues with violence,

39

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

hostility, force and illegality. Court should not in my view encourage such

illegal conduct. Court must resist converting illegality into legality unless

there are cogent and compelling reasons to do so. As stated by

Udalagama J. in the Supreme Court case of Kiriamma v. Podibanda

[2005] BLR 9 at 11 considerable circumspection is necessary to recognize

the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality

made legal due to the other party not taking action.

Can the defendants evidence be considered in a rei vindicatio

action?

Whilst emphasising that (a) the initial burden in a rei vindicatio action is

on the plaintiff to prove ownership of the property in suit and (b) the

burden of proof in a rei vindicatio action is proof on a balance of

probabilities, if the plaintiff in such an action has sufficient title or

superior title or better title than that of the defendant, the plaintiff

shall succeed. No rule of thumb can be laid down on what circumstances

the Court shall hold that the plaintiff has discharged his burden. Whether

or not the plaintiff proved his title shall be decided upon a consideration

of the totality of the evidence led in the case.

In this process, the defendants evidence need not be treated as illegal,

inadmissible or forbidden. The oft-quoted dicta of Herat J. in

Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy (1962) 65 NLR 167 that The

defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove anything, still less, his

own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour

merely on the strength that the defendants title is poor or not established.

The plaintiff must prove and establish his title. shall not be

misinterpreted to equate a defendant in a rei vindicatio action with an

accused in a criminal case where inter alia his confession made to a police

40

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

officer is inadmissible and he can remain silent until the prosecution

proves its case beyond reasonable doubt.

I must add that even in a criminal case, if a strong prima facie case has

been made out against the accused by the prosecution, the accused owes

an explanation, if it is within the power of him to offer such explanation.

This is in consonance with the dictum of Lord Elenborough in Rex v.

Cochrane (Garneys Reports 479) which is commonly known as

Elenborough dictum. In reference to this dictum, Dep J. (later C.J.) in

Ranasinghe v. O.I.C. Police Station, Warakapola (SC/APPEAL/39/2011,

SC Minutes of 02.04.2014) states:

This dictum could be applied in cases where there is a strong prima

facie case made out against the accused and if he refrains from

explaining suspicious circumstances attach to him when it is in his

own power to offer evidence. In such a situation an adverse

inference can be drawn against him.

The dicta of Herath J. in Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy (supra) is

eminently relevant to the facts of that particular case but has no

universal application to all rei vindicatio actions. Since it is a one-page

brief judgment, the facts are not very clear. However, as I understand,

the plaintiffs in that case had filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendant on the basis that the defendant was a trespasser

notwithstanding that he (the defendant) had been in occupation of some

portions of the land for some considerable period of time. From the

following sentence found in the judgment, In this case, the plaintiffs

produced a recent deed in their favour and further stated in evidence that

they could not take possession of the shares purchased by them because

they were resisted by the 1st defendant, it is clear that the plaintiffs, if at

all, had only undivided rights in the land. It is also clear from the

judgment that whether or not the defendant also had undivided rights

41

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

was not clear to Court. It is in that context Herat J. states The learned

District Judge, in his judgment expatiates on the weakness of the defence

case; but unfortunately has failed to examine what title, if any, has been

established by the plaintiffs. No evidence of title has been established

by the plaintiffs in our opinion.

It may be noted that in Wanigaratnes case, the finding of the Supreme

Court is that No evidence of title has been established by the plaintiffs.

The facts are totally different in the instant case. In the instant case, even

the High Court accepts that the plaintiff is entitled to 11/12 shares of the

land by deed of transfer No. 2411 marked at the trial P3. The defendant

does not have paper title to the land. The prescriptive claim preferred by

the defendant was rejected by Court.

As this Court held in Wasantha v. Premaratne (SC/APPEAL/176/2014,

SC Minutes of 17.05.2021), the Court can in a rei vindicatio action

consider the evidence of the defendant in arriving at the correct

conclusion:

Notwithstanding that in a rei vindicatio action the burden is on the

plaintiff to prove title to the land no matter how fragile the case of

the defendant is, the Court is not debarred from taking into

consideration the evidence of the defendant in deciding whether or

not the plaintiff has proved his title. Not only is the Court not

debarred from doing so, it is in fact the duty of the Court to give due

regard to the defendants case, for otherwise there is no purpose in

a rei vindicatio action in allowing the defendant to lead evidence

when all he seeks is for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

Actio rei vindicatio and action in rem

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 173 Gratiaen J. states:

42

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way

of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in

truth an action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding

tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the

declaration is based on proof of ownership in the latter, on proof of

the contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the lessor is

the true owner.

The fact that a rei vindicatio action is identified as an action in rem has

unmistakably contributed to expect a high degree of proof of title from a

plaintiff in such an action. Is this thinking correct?

The phrase in rem requires an explanation rather than a definition. The

Latin term in rem derives from the word res, which means a thing or

an object whether movable or immovable. Actions in rem were originally

used as a means of protecting title to movables, especially slaves, because

land was not at first the object of private ownership Buckland and

McNair, Roman Law and Common Law Comparison (Cambridge

University Press, 1936) p. 6. Also, in rem jurisdiction is invoked in

maritime cases where a party could bring an action in rem against a ship

instead of the owner of the ship. It is the ship that suffers the

consequences. The owner suffers the consequences if it is an action in

personam.

Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law, Vol II, 8th Edition (1960),

p.70 states The form of action for the recovery of ownership was under

the Roman law called vindicatio rei, which was an action in rem, that is,

aimed at the recovery of the thing which is in the possession of another,

whether such possession was rightfully or wrongfully acquired, together

with all its accretions and fruits, and compensation in damages for any

loss sustained by the owner through having been deprived of it.

43

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Blacks Law Dictionary, 11th edition, defines the term in rem as Latin

against a thing Involving or determining the status of a thing, and

therefore the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing. It

defines the term in personam as Latin against a person Involving or

determining the personal rights and obligations of the parties. (Of a legal

action) brought against a person rather than property.

The following passage of Dr. H. W. Tambiah (op. cit. p. 242) explains why

rei vindicatio is an action in rem.

The primary remedy granted to an owner against the person who

disputes his ownership is rei vindicatio. This Roman-Dutch Law

remedy has been adopted by the courts in Sri Lanka. Since the

owner, as dominus, has a right of possession, occupation and use of

the land, this action is in the nature of an action in rem. See Vulcan

Rubber Ltd. v. South African Railways and Harbours, 3 S.A. 285

(1958); Hissaias v. Lehman, 4 S.A. 715 (1958). In this type of action,

the owner of land whose title is disputed and who has been

unlawfully ejected, may bring an action for a declaration of title and

ejectment. If the owner has not been ejected but his title is disputed

he is entitled to bring a declaratory action to dismiss any disputes

to his title. Where an owner is unlawfully ejected he may bring an

action for declaration of title for mesne profits, damages and

ejectment.

In the case of Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy (1894) 3 SCR 87, Withers J.

categorised rei vindicatio both as an action in rem and action in personam:

Certain actions of an analogous nature apart, the action rei

vindicatio is allowed to the owner and to him alone. Lesion to the

right of property is of the very essence of the action and in that

respect constitutes it an action in rem. Lesion to the personal right of

44

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

the true proprietor properly constitutes a claim to compensation for

the produce of which he has been deprived by the possessor and in

that respect constitutes it an action in personam.

In classical Roman Law although actio rei vindicatio is classified as an

action in rem as opposed to an action in personam, the term action in

rem shall not be understood in the popular sense that we conceive in

contemporary society. An action in rem means an action against a thing

whereas an action in personam means an action against a person. A

partition action is considered an action in rem in that the judgment in a

partition action has a binding effect on all persons having interests in the

property whether or not joined as parties to the action. It transcends the

characteristic of an inter partes action and assumes the characteristic of

an action in rem resulting in title good against the world. The scheme of

the Partition Law is designed to serve that purpose. But the entire world

is not bound by the judgment in a rei vindicatio action. The judgment in

a rei vindicatio action binds only the parties to the action and their

privies. In modern-day legal jargon, rei vindicatio is not an action in rem

but an action in personam.

The fact that rei vindicatio is not an action in rem in the popular sense is

reflected in the dicta of Dep C.J. in Preethi Anura v. William Silva (supra)

where in reference to the standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action it was

stated The plaintiff's task is to establish the case on a balance of

probability. In a partition case the situation is different as it is an action in

rem and the trial judge is required to carefully examine the title and the

devolution of title.

In Sithy Makeena v. Kuraisha [2006] 2 Sri LR 341 at 344, Imam J. with

Sriskandarajah J. in agreement stated It is well-settled law that only the

parties to a rei vindicatio action are bound by the decision in such a case,

45

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

as a rei vindicatio action is an action in personam and not an action in

rem.

In the Supreme Court case of Mojith Kumara v. Ariyaratne

(SC/APPEAL/123/2015, SC Minutes of 29.03.2016), the plaintiff filed

action seeking declaration of title to the land in suit, ejectment of the

defendants therefrom and damages. It was a rei vindicatio action proper.

The defendants sought dismissal of the plaintiffs action. The plaintiff

relied on a decree entered in his favour in a previous rei vindicatio action

filed against a different party, but in respect of the same land. The District

Court dismissed the plaintiffs action on the basis that the defendants

before Court were not parties to the previous action and therefore they

are not bound by that judgment. On appeal, the High Court set aside the

judgment of the District Court and held that the plaintiff can claim

ownership to the land on the strength of the previous decree apparently

on the basis that rei vindicatio is an action in rem. The Supreme Court

held that the previous action is an action in personam and not an action

in rem and therefore third parties are not bound by that judgment.

Chitrasiri J. with the agreement of Aluwihare J. and De Abrew J. held:

A decree in a case in which a declaration of title is sought binds only

the parties in that action. Such a proposition is not applicable when

it comes to a decree in rem which binds the whole world. Effects and

consequences of actions in rem and actions in personam are quite

different. Action in rem is a proceeding that determines the rights

over a particular property that would become conclusive against the

entire world such as the decisions in courts exercising admiralty

jurisdictions and the decisions in partition actions under the partition

law of this country. Procedure stipulated in Partition Law contains

provisions enabling interested parties to come before courts and to

join as parties to the action even though the plaintiff fails to make

46

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

them as parties to it. Therefore there is a rationale to treat the

decrees in partition cases as decrees in rem.

Actions in personam are a type of legal proceedings which can affect

the personal rights and interests of the property claimed by the

parties to the action. Such actions include an action for breach of

contract, the commission of a tort or delict or the possession of

property. Where an action in personam is successful, the judgment

may be enforced only against the defendants assets that include

real and personal or movable and immovable properties. Therefore,

a decree in a rei vindicatio action is considered as a decree that

would bind only the parties to the action. In the circumstances, it is

clear that the plaintiff cannot rely on the decree in 503/L to establish

rights to the property in question as against the defendants in this

case are concerned.

The defendant cannot raise questions of fact for the first time in the

Supreme Court

After leave to appeal was granted to the plaintiff by this Court, the

defendant has raised two purported questions of law which I quoted at

the outset. By these purported questions of law the defendant seeks to

argue that the plaintiff has not established that the land described in the

second schedule to the plaint is part of the land described in the first

schedule to the plaint. It is significant to note that this was not put in

issue at the trial in the District Court. This is not a question of law but a

question of fact. Any question which is not a pure question of law, but a

question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law, cannot be raised for

the first time in appeal. Vide Hameed alias Abdul Rahman v.

Weerasinghe [1989] 1 Sri LR 217, Leslin Jayasinghe v. Illangaratne [2006]

2 Sri LR 39, Simon Fernando v. Bernadette Fernando [2003] 2 Sri LR 158,

Gunawardena v. Daraniyagala [2010] 1 Sri LR 309, Somawathie v.

47

SC/APPEAL/171/2019

Wilmon [2010] 1 Sri LR 128, Piyadasa v. Babanis [2006] 2 Sri LR 17 at

24, Leslin Jayasinghe v. Illangaratne [2006] 2 Sri LR 39 at 47.

In any event, the defendant in his evidence has unequivocally admitted

that the land described in the second schedule to the plaint is part of the

land described in the first schedule to the plaint (vide page 242 of the

brief) and therefore the matter should end there.

Conclusion

The two questions of law raised on behalf of the plaintiff are answered in

the affirmative.

The two questions of law raised on behalf of the defendant are misleading

questions: The first is answered The land described in the second

schedule to the plaint is admittedly part of the land described in the first

schedule to the plaint. The second is answered Does not arise.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment of

the District Court. The plaintiff is entitled to costs in all three Courts.
