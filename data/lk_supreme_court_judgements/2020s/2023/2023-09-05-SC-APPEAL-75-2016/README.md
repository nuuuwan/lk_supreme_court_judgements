Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action against the three Defendants in the District

Court of Embilipitiya seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in the schedule to the plaint, the ejectment of the Defendants therefrom

and damages. The Defendants filed answer seeking the dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action and a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the answer. After trial, the District Court entered Judgment

for the Plaintiff except for damages. The Court of Appeal affirmed the

Judgment of the District Court and dismissed the Defendants appeal.

This appeal with leave obtained is from the Judgment of the Court of

Appeal.

In summary, this Court granted leave to appeal on two main questions of

law: (a) has the Plaintiff established that he is the owner of the land

described in the schedule to the plaint? and (b) has the land described in

the schedule to the plaint been properly identified? It is common ground

that if the answers to both or one of them is in the negative, the Plaintiffs

action shall fail. At the argument, learned Counsel for the Defendants

placed special emphasis on (b) above, i.e. failure to identify the land.

The land the Plaintiff claims title to, as described in the schedule to the

plaint, is as follows:

3

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

The land called and known as Lunulandahena situate at Kolonna in

the Kolonnagam Pattu of Kolonna Korale in the District of Ratnapura

of the Sabaragamuwa Province bounded on the North by

Heendeniya, South by Heena, East by Watumandiya and West by

Divulgahawatta in extent of forty Kurunis of Kurakkan sowing area.

Although it is not decisive, according to traditional Sinhala land

measurements (as cited in Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy [2002] 1 Sri LR 65

at 81), in general terms, one Laha or Kuruni of Kurakkan sowing area is

equivalent to one acre and one Laha or Kuruni of Paddy sowing area is

equivalent to ten perches. The Plaintiff claims title to a portion of land in

extent of forty Kurunis of Kurakkan sowing area. This means, the Plaintiff

in the plaint claims a portion of land in extent of about forty acres.

On what basis does the Plaintiff claim title to this land? He traces title

to the land to a decree entered in favour of his father on 11.02.1944 by

the Court of Requests of Ratnapura in case No. 1845 marked P5. But

the land described in the said decree is not identical to the land described

in the schedule to the plaint. The land described in the decree is as

follows:

The land called and known as Lunulandehena situate at Kolonna

bounded on the North by Meedeniya [not Heendeniya as claimed by

the Plaintiff], South by Heenna, East by Watumandiyahena [not

Watumandiya as claimed by the Plaintiff] and West by

Divulgahawatta in extent of forty Seers [not forty Kurunis as

claimed by the Plaintiff] of Kurakkan sowing area.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submits that Kuruni instead of Seers

in the description of the extent of the land in the plaint is a typographical

error and the variance in the northern boundary from Meedeniya to

Heendeniya may be due to the lapse of time. Learned Counsel is silent

4

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

about the discrepancy in the eastern boundary. In my view, this is not

the stage to correct typographical errors or explain discrepancies in the

boundaries. Those matters ought to have been addressed at the trial

Court and not in the final Court. No explanation on this has been given

by the Plaintiff in his evidence before the District Court.

Even assuming Kuruni instead of Seers is a typographical error,

according to the same source cited above, one Kuruni is equivalent to four

Seers. Forty Seers then means ten acres.

However, the Plaintiff in his evidence says the land he claims is

approximately two acres. This is manifestly irreconcilable. It is difficult

to understand how a forty-acre land or ten-acre land reduces to a two-

acre land. There is no explanation forthcoming from the Plaintiff.

How does the Plaintiff describe the land in his evidence? The Plaintiff does

not properly describe the boundaries of the land. He says the four

boundaries are now different from the description of the land in the

schedule to the plaint. He speaks of only two boundaries: North by a

ditch and East by a road and live fence, which are incompatible with the

boundaries given by him in the schedule to the plaint. He also says

towards the Defendants land lies Watumandiya. (Page 39 of the Brief)

This answer lends support to the Defendants position that the

Defendants are in possession of a different land because Watumandiya

is the eastern boundary of the Plaintiffs land as described in the schedule

to the plaint.

Making confusion worse confounded, the Plaintiff in the document

marked P2 says the land in suit is also known as Watumandiyahena (not

Watumandiya). P2 describes the land as Lunulandehena alias

Watumandiyahena. It may be recalled that in the decree marked P5,

Watumandiyahena is the eastern boundary of Lunulandehena. In other

5

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

words, Lunulandehena and Watumandiyahena cannot be the same land

but are two adjoining lands. Further, according to P3 marked by the

Plaintiff, the land is also known as Watumandiya and Maiyaundage

Idama. P3 says Lunulandehena alias Watumandiya alias Maiyaundage

Idama.

It is also relevant to note that the Plaintiff in his evidence states at one

stage that Lunulandehena comprises several lands. (Page 42 of the Brief)

The Defendants claim a different land by name, boundaries and extent.

It is described in the schedule to the answer as follows:

The land called and known as Dunlandagawattahena situate at

Kolonna in the Kolonnagam Pattu of Kolonna Korale in the District of

Ratnapura of the Sabaragamuwa Province bounded on the North by

Ditch and Live Fence, East by Road and Live Fence, South and West

by Live Fence in extent of about two acres.

In my view, the Plaintiff in his evidence claimed two acres of land because

the land claimed by the Defendants in the answer is a land in extent of

about two acres. Also the Plaintiff vaguely gave boundaries such as

North by Ditch; and East by Road and Live Fence in contradiction to the

boundaries given in the plaint because these are the boundaries given by

the Defendants in their answer describing the land they claim.

This approach of the Plaintiff is unacceptable in a vindicatory action such

as this. The Plaintiff in a vindicatory action cannot come to Court in

anticipation of proving his case with the material provided by the

Defendant. Nor can the Plaintiff in such an action strengthen his case by

highlighting the weaknesses of the Defendants case. The Defendant in

a vindicatory action has no burden to discharge until the Plaintiff proves

his title. It is only after proof of the Plaintiffs title that the burden shifts

to the Defendant to prove on what right he is in possession of the land.

6

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

However, I must add that proof of title without proper identification of the

land is futile. Title shall be proved in respect of a properly identified

portion of land which forms the subject matter of the dispute. If

identification of the corpus fails, the action must fail. There is no need

to go into the question of title.

The plaint is not accompanied by a plan to identify the land as required

by section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code; nor did the Plaintiff take out a

commission to prepare a plan after the institution of the action.

Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

When the claim made in the action is for some specific portion of

land, or for some share or interest in a specific portion of land, then

the portion of land must be described in the plaint so far as possible

by reference to physical metes and bounds, or by reference to a

sufficient sketch, map, or plan to be appended to the plaint, and not

by name only.

If the land the Plaintiff claims title to cannot be identified on the ground

with precision, in the event the Plaintiff succeeds in the action, how can

the Fiscal eject the Defendants and hand over possession of the land to

the Plaintiff when the Defendants have taken up the position that they

are not in possession of the land described in the schedule to the plaint?

The delivery of possession in such circumstances is not possible. Vide

David v. Gnanawathie [2000] 2 Sri LR 352, Gunasekera v. Punchimenika

[2002] 2 Sri LR 43.

It was held in Peeris v. Savunhamy (1951) 54 NLR 207 that a Plaintiff in

a rei vindicatio action must not only prove dominium to the land but also

the boundaries of it, by evidence admissible in law.

7

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

In Hettiarachchi v. Gunapala [2008] 2 Appellate Law Recorder 70 at 79, it

was held that if the Plaintiff fails to identify the land he claims dominium

to with the land on the ground, his action must fail.

Marsoof, J. in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 378 expressed

the same in greater detail:

The identity of the subject matter is of paramount importance in a rei

vindicatio action because the object of such an action is to determine

ownership of the property, which objective cannot be achieved

without the property being clearly identified. Where the property

sought to be vindicated consists of land, the land sought to be

vindicated must be identified by reference to a survey plan or other

equally expeditious method. It is obvious that ownership cannot be

ascribed without clear identification of the property that is subjected

to such ownership, and furthermore, the ultimate objective of a

person seeking to vindicate immovable property by obtaining a writ

of execution in terms of Section 323 of the Civil Procedure Code will

be frustrated if the fiscal to whom the writ is addressed, cannot

clearly identify the property by reference to the decree for the

purpose of giving effect to it. It is therefore essential in a vindicatory

action, as much as in a partition action, for the corpus to be identified

with precision.

The Defendants have disputed the identification of the corpus in the

answer and also raised it by way of an issue. Issue No.16 raised by the

Defendants is as follows: Is the land described in the schedule to the

plaint a separate one different from the land described in the schedule to

the answer? The learned District Judge, without analysing the evidence,

perfunctorily answered this issue in the negative and the Court of Appeal

affirmed it.

8

SC/APPEAL/75/2016

There is real confusion about the identification of the land the Plaintiff

claims in terms of name, boundaries and extent. The Plaintiff has failed

to identify the land in suit, which is of paramount importance to succeed

in this action. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeal failed to

address this vital issue, which goes to the root of the case, in its proper

perspective. I answer question (b) upon which leave was granted in

favour of the Defendants.

In view of the above finding, there is no necessity to go into the question

whether the Plaintiff proved title to the land in suit.

The Judgments of both the District Court and the Court of Appeal are set

aside and the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants is allowed. The

plaintiffs action in the District Court shall stand dismissed. On the facts

and circumstances of this case, I make no order as to costs.
