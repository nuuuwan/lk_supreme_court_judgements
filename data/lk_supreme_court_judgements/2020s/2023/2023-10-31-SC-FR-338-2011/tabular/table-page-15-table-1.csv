"applicable to the subject matter. To permit such disregard for the law by public"
"authorities, who are beneficiaries and trustees of public resources would, in my"
"view be an abdication of this Courtâ€™s duty. Therefore, while I do not hold that"
"the Petitioners bore a legitimate expectation of being granted permits to occupy"
"the lands they presently occupy, I hold that the Mahaweli Authority has been"
"remiss in permitting unlawful representations to be made. These representations"
"have led to the Petitioners harbouring hopes and expectations which, had they"
"been clarified in the first instance, the Petitioners would not have borne."
