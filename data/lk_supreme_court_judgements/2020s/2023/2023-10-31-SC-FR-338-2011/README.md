Judgement Aluwihare, PC, J,

The Facts

1) The 1st, 2nd and the 3rd Petitioners took up temporary residence at No. 654/1,

Balagolla, Kengalle, No. 668/1A, Balagolla, Kengalle and No. 668B, Balagolla,

Kengalle respectively between the years 1992 and 1994. They have not relocated

to any other residence since then and are currently residing in the same. All of

the aforementioned dwellings are situated in State lands belonging to the Victoria

Reservoir Project, adjacent to the Reservoir. This fact is admitted and forms the

basis of contention for the detailed submissions made by all parties in this case.

2) The Balagolla Division had been initially used for settling persons whose houses

were acquired for the purpose of constructing the Victoria Reservoir. The

Petitioners are 3, among 55 other Occupants of settlements which were added

to the Balagolla settlement area and permitted to reside in the vicinity of the

Division. The Petitioners annexed a map titled Blocking Out Diagram

Pallekalle Estate Balagolla Division, and this map demarcates the lots allocated

to the Petitioners.

3) At various points of time, the Petitioners had made several pleas and requests to

the 1st Respondent Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Mahaweli Authority)

4

seeking a plot of land to construct permanent housing. In response, the

Mahaweli Authority informed the Petitioners by letter dated 30th May 2005 (P1

in the brief), that they were requested to be present for an inquiry to regularise

their residencies.

4) Pursuant to the above letter, a Land Kachcheri had been held on 17th June 2005

and on the same day, lands had been allocated to 298 individuals including the

Petitioners. A separate list titled

[Recommended list of unsanctioned dwellings to be Regularised] (P2

in the brief) was prepared and displayed around the Petitioners neighbourhood.

The list, comprising in total 55 individuals names had also included the

Petitioners names. Per the list, the Petitioners had been granted the lots they were

already in occupation.

5) In 2006, the Petitioners had constructed permanent houses in the lots granted

and had made substantive improvements to the lands by obtaining electricity and

water lines. The petitioners had also had lands they occupied surveyed in 2007

and the maps issued, with the specific demarcations and extent (20 Perches) of

the plots have been produced (P5(a)-(c) in the brief). By letters dated April

2007, the Licensed Surveyor informed the Mahaweli Authorities that the survey

conducted on the instructions of the Petitioners was completed (P4 in the brief).

Although the Petitioners had thereafter repeatedly inquired from the Respondent

Authority regarding the regularisation of lands they occupied, no further steps

had been taken by the Authority.

6) On or around the same time, the Petitioners became aware of the regularisation

of other lands and residences which were published in P2. The Petitioners

claimed to be aware that several officers of the Respondent Mahaweli Authority

have taken up residence in lots of the Division. Specifically, the Petitioners

claimed that the 2nd Respondent is living in one of those lands, and was, at the

time of the application, constructing a large house therein. The petitioners also

claimed to be aware that one of the lands in the Division was granted without a

Land Kachcheri to a Police Constable Costa who is related to a Linton

Wijesinghe, a member of the Central Provincial Council.

5

7) On 23rd July 2008, by way of a letter (P7), the Petitioners were informed that;

- they had been selected for regularisation of their residences;

- they were required to contract the services of a Licensed Surveyor to survey

the lands in order to facilitate an issuance of relevant permits; and

- that the surveying of the lands had been delayed due to a shortage of

surveyors on the part of the Authority.

The Petitioners then informed the Authority that lands they occupied had already

been surveyed.

8) Thereafter, on or around January 2011, an Application for Ejectment had been

filed in the Magistrates Court of Kandy by the 5th Respondent, the Engineer in

Charge, under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 07

of 1979 in respect of the Petitioners. The relevant Case references are as follows;

- Case No. 35033/11 against the 1st Petitioner

- Case No. 35028/11 against the 2nd Petitioner

- Case No. 33069/11 against the 3rd Petitioner

In June and July 2011, the Magistrates Court of Kandy issued Orders to eject the

2nd and 3rd Petitioners from their residences and at the time of this application,

the 1st Petitioner stated that he bore a reasonable apprehension that an order for

ejectment would be issued against him too.

9) On 7th August 2011, the Petitioners filed a petitioner in this Court, alleging the

violation of their Fundamental Rights Guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and

14(1)(h) of the Constitution. This Court granted leave to proceed under Article

12(1) on 23rd September 2011 and vide Supreme Court Minutes dated

23.09.2011, cases instituted against the Petitioners were stayed until the

determination of this case.

10) During the pendency of proceedings before this Court, the Respondents

appraised the Court and the Petitioners of the possibility of offering alternative

land in the Ambakote area, pursuant to the alternative relief sought in the

Petition. However, the Petitioners declined this offer [vide Journal Entries dated

10.11.2021 and 28.07.2021].

6

The Position of the Petitioners

11) The Petitioners contended that the Petitioners bore a legitimate expectation due

to repeated assurances of the Mahaweli Authority that their residences would be

regularised and acting on such expectation, the Petitioners set up permanent

residence and made substantial improvements to their respective houses and

lands. In such context, the Petitioners argued that the attempt to evict or eject

the Petitioners was arbitrary, done for collateral purposes such as offering those

lands to favoured individuals, and in a manner contrary to principles of natural

justice. The Petitioners submitted that the conduct of the Respondents so

impugned violated the Petitioners Fundamental Right to equal protection of the

Law guaranteed under Article 12(1).

12) Moreover, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the right to be

adequately housed, including having secure tenure, right to respect for home

and family life are crucial to the dignity of the Petitioners and are therefore rights

which would fall within the ambit of rights to be safeguarded by Article 12(1).

13) The Petitioners contended that the move to eject the Petitioners from their

residences was contrary to principles of natural justice and the legitimate

expectation borne by the Petitioners due to repeated and consistent assurances

of the Mahaweli Authority, and if allowed, would cause great injustice to the

Petitioners and also (relying on the judgement of Dayarathna v. Minister of

Health and Indigenous Medicine [1999] 1 SLR 393) amount to a violation of

their Fundamental Right to equal protection of Law guaranteed under Article

12(1).

14) Adverting to the jurisprudential evolution of the concept of equal protection,

and relying on the decisions of Karunathilaka v. Jayalath de Silva [2003] 1 SLR

35 and Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, S.C F.R 256/2017, S.C Minutes

of 11.12.2020, the learned Counsel noted that it is now understood that

reasonableness and fairness are conceptual elements the court may take

cognizance of when considering an alleged violation of Article 12(1).

7

15) It was the submission of the Petitioners therefore that, in considering this

application, the Court would be mindful of the injustice caused to the Petitioners

by the Respondents and also that relief could be granted in respect of any

arbitrary or mala fide exercise of power vide Rajavarothiam Sampanthan &

Others v. The Attorney General & Others, SC FR 351-361/2018, S.C Minutes of

13.12.2018.

The Position of the Respondents

16) The Respondents submitted that the Petitioners were and continue to remain in

unauthorised occupation of State Land and the Petitioners have converted the

temporary residences into permanent residences prior to them being issued with

any Permit, Grant or Document permitting such occupation.

17) The Respondents contend that the said residences were illegal as the construction

of houses on private lands adjacent to Reservoirs is monitored and are subject to

guidelines (4R3) and in terms of the Regulations promulgated under Section 54

of the Mahaweli Authority Act of Sri Lanka (4R1) vide Section 7.7(b),

construction of buildings and structures in and around a Reservoir without prior

approval is prohibited.

18) It is also the position of the Respondents that although a Land Kachcheri was

held, and a List was prepared, no steps were taken to issue Permits, Grants or

any written authority regularising the unauthorised occupation of the

Petitioners.

19) The Respondents claimed that the move to eject the Petitioners was taken

pursuant to, and in deference to a judgement of this Court. The said judgement

being Environmental Foundation Limited & Others v. Mahaweli Authority of Sri

Lanka & Others [2010] 1 SLR 1. This Fundamental Rights Application was filed

in the Public Interest complaining of a violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution by the alienation of the lands and the granting of permission for

construction of buildings on lands in an arbitrary and ad hoc manner in violation

of the applicable legal provisions and guidelines. The said lands were within the

8

Special Area declared in terms of Section 3(1) of the Mahaweli Authority Act

No. 23 of 1979 and also fell within the 100-metre reservation from the full

supply level of the Victoria Reservoir. In this case, having upheld a violation of

Article 12(1) on the part of the Mahaweli Authority, the Court made the

directions listed below.

(b) Court directs that a proper investigation be conducted by the 2nd

Respondent and suitable action be taken against the officials responsible for the

unauthorized alienations and the granting of permission to construct buildings

in violation of the applicable legal provisions,

(c) Court holds that no further allocation of lands in the subject area be made

without following the procedure laid down under Part IV C of the National

Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, and the regulations made their under,

(d) Court also holds that the guidelines contained in the document annexed

marked as P12 to the petition be followed in the future when granting

permission for the construction of residential buildings.

20) In the same judgement [supra], this Court had also observed that the Mahaweli

Authority had failed to comply with Guidelines issued on 18.06.1997 for the

Construction of Houses in Private Lands [4R3] formulated by a Special

Committee appointed by the Director General of the Mahaweli Authority. Per

the Guidelines, there should be a minimum land area of around 20 meters

between two houses. It was also observed in the judgement that the Hon.

Attorney General had advised the Director General of the Mahaweli Authority

that the Director General has no legal authority to permit any construction in

derogation of these guidelines and that the alienation of lands and the granting

of permission to construct housing as it pertained to that case, had been done in

violation of the guidelines.

21) Another matter which was addressed by this Court in the aforementioned

judgement was that the regulations promulgated in terms of Section 23Z of the

National Environment Act as amended had not been complied with. The

9

regulations contain a schedule of projects for which approval is required under

Part IV of the Act and defines the term reservoir as follows:

reservoir means an expanse of water resulting from manmade constructions

across a river or a stream to store or regulate water. Its environs will include

that area extending up to a distance of 100 meters from full supply of the

reservoir inclusive of all islands falling within the reservoir.

Subsequently, the regulations had been amended by Gazette No. 859/14 dated

23.12.1995 to include a 100-meter boundary from a lake as well.

within 100 meters from the high flood level contour of, or within, a public lake

as defined in the Crown Lands Ordinance including those declared under Section

71 of the said ordinance.

22) The Respondents averred that the steps taken to evict the Petitioners were taken

pursuant to cognizance of the aforementioned judgment which highlighted the

failure on the part of the Mahaweli Authority to comply with the provisions of

the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act, the National Environment Act and the

Regulations promulgated under the Act to alienation of State Land situated

within 100-meter reservation adjacent to the Victoria Reservoir.

23) The Respondents also relied on the interpretation provided to unauthorised

possession or occupation in the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to

substantiate the contention that the Petitioners were residing illegally, in a

manner liable to being issued a Quit Notice in terms of Section 3 of the Act, and

if such notice is not complied, eviction proceedings being instituted under

Section 5 of the Act. Section 18 of the Act defines unauthorised possession or

occupation as follows:

Except possession or occupation upon a valid permit or other written authority

of the State granted in accordance with any written law, and includes possession

or occupation by encroachment upon State Land.

10

24) The Respondents also submitted that per the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, a person on whom the quit notice is issued bears an opportunity to appear

and show cause to establish lawful possession or occupation of State Land based

on a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law. Essentially, it was the submission of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that without a valid permit or other written authority, the

Petitioners were in unlawful occupation of state land and were therefore liable

to be ejected in the manner prescribed by the Act, and if the Petitioners wished

to demonstrate a contrary position, they may do so as prescribed by the Act,

before the learned Magistrate. The Respondents also relied on the judgements of

Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt.) Ltd v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority & Another [1993]

1 SLR 219, Aravindakumar v. Alwis & Others [2007] 1 SLR 316, Senanayake v.

Damunupola [1982] 2 SLR 621 and Muhandiram v. Chairman, Janatha Estate

Development Board [1992] 1 SLR 110 to further substantiate their position.

25) Furthermore, responding to the Petitioners claim that while they were not issued

permanent permits, other persons, one Police Constable Costa who is related to

a Linton Wijesinghe, a member of the Central Provincial Council and the 2nd

Respondent, the Director General of the Mahaweli Authority, the 4th Respondent,

in his affidavit, states that the Petitioners were not issued with temporary

permits, the Petitioners were squatters and that the permits issued to the 2nd

Respondent and Police Constable Costa were by way of the Crown Lands

Ordinance ad the State Lands Ordinance respectively.

Determination

26) The Petitioners complaint is primarily twofold. First, the Petitioners complain

that despite repeated, consistent assurances, both verbal and written, the

Mahaweli Authority reneged on such assurances and instead, attempted to evict

the Petitioners from their residences. Secondly, that the Petitioners were treated

differently in that lands they occupied were not regularised while other the lands

in the same neighbourhood were regularised, and such lands are now occupied

by a Police Constable Costa and an Officer of the Respondent Mahaweli

Authority.

11

27) Upon examining the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act,

I am of the opinion that the conduct of the Respondents in attempting to evict

the Petitioners was not unlawful. The petitioners were unlawful occupants of

State Land per the scheme of the Act and the Respondents were lawfully entitled

to seek ejectment per Section 5 of the Act.

28) The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners argued that Article 12(1) encompasses

a fundamental right to secure housing. I do not think a fundamental right to

secure housing rests within the ambit of rights offered by Article 12(1). A

qualified right to remain housed without arbitrarily, mala fide, unlawful

interference or hindrance may however exist within the equal protection the law

guarantees under Article 12(1) of our Constitution. In that regard, I cannot more

strenuously state how greatly a persons state of residence affects their dignity.

Every person aspires to be secure in their residence devoid of compulsion to

relocate. Our lives are invariably defined by where we reside, and this truth

forms the core of the Petitioners complaint. For all intents and purposes, these

families considered these lands their home. It is therefore imperative that this

Court examines whether the Petitioners were sought to be evicted arbitrarily, in

bad faith, unlawfully or in a manifestly unjust manner.

29) I must admit that the Court is placed in a difficult position. On the one hand, the

Respondents have not traversed the law in attempting to evict the Petitioners,

and they claim to have undertaken such action in deference to a judgement of

this Court. On the other hand, despite the lawfulness of such attempt, the

Petitioners complaint is remarkably genuine and tragic. The Petitioners were

first told by way of a published list [P1] that there lands have been selected for

regularisation, giving rise to the expectation that they would be able to securely

reside in the lands they occupied and thereafter, upon seeking persistent

clarifications, they were repeatedly assured that there would be no cause for

insecurity, their residences would be regularised, and the evident delay was due

to an insufficiency of resources on the part of the Authority. This is most evident

in the letter dated 23rd July 2008 P7. The letter is reproduced here to

demonstrate the gravity of the assurance given.

12

30) Acting upon the mentioned assurances, the Petitioners took steps to enhance

their quality of life by obtaining a secure supply of water and electricity and

13

making substantial improvements to their houses. Subsequently, without

forewarning, the Petitioners were issued a Quit Notice and ordered to remove

themselves from their homes.

31) It is of import that P7 is dated 23rd July 2008. The Judgement in Environmental

Foundation Limited & Others v. Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka & Others

[2010] 1 SLR 1 was delivered on 17th June 2010 (vide S.C Minutes of

17.06.2010), and the Petitioners were sought to be ejected from the lands they

occupied in January of 2011. Therefore, I find the submission of the

Respondents-that the move to eject the Petitioners was taken pursuant to and in

deference to the aforementioned judgement of this Court, compelling, and

considering the lack of any material impeaching the claim, on a balance of

probabilities, acceptable.

32) However, this submission expressly admits that the Mahaweli Authority had not

been complying with the law and relevant regulations until the pronouncement

of the said judgement. Therefore, it logically follows that the representation

made to the Petitioners by way of P7 too was ill-formed in that it was based on

an illegality. Put simply, no officer of the Respondent Mahaweli Authority was

legally entitled to approve or convey any assurance of such approval of the

regularisation of lands or structures constructed in violation of the 100-meter

reservation regulation.

33) A crucial point of law is to be addressed here. What requires adjudication is

whether the verbal and written assurances given to the Petitioners gave rise to a

legitimate expectation on the part of the Petitioners that lands they occupied

would be regularised. It is the submission of the Petitioners that the assurances

of the Respondents gave rise to a substantive legitimate expectation that the lands

they occupied would be regularised and they would be issued permits. However,

it is now settled in our law that a legitimate expectation cannot arise upon an

illegality and that a representation which in itself is ultra vires cannot bind a

public authority. His Lordship Sarath N. Silva, CJ in Tokyo Cement (Company)

Ltd Vs. Director General of Customs [2005] BLR 24 (at p.27-28) cited the

judgement of the Court of Appeal of England in Regina Vs. Secretary of State for

14

Education and Employment, Ex parte Begbie [WLR 2000 Vol. 1, p. 115] which

held that courts would not give effect to a legitimate expectation if it would

require a public authority to act contrary to the terms of the statute. This

approach was subsequently followed by the Court of Appeal in Ceylon Agro-

Industries Ltd Vs. Director General of Customs [CA Writ 622/2009] C.A

Minutes14.02.2011 at p.8, Manufacturers (Pvt) Ltd Vs L.K.G Gunawardena &

Others [CA /Writ/242/2015] C.A Minutes 15.12.2016 at pp.6-7 and in

Pushparaja Vs. UC Of Nawalapitiya [CA PHC No. 161/2008] C.A

Minutes15.03.2019 at p.6. Therefore, it is my considered opinion that P7 and

any other verbal assurances given to the Petitioners to the effect that the lands

occupied by the Petitioners would be regularized and the Petitioners would be

granted permits was devoid of any force in law, as it was ultra vires from

inception.

34) It is the bounden duty of the Court to adjudicate a matter with complete fidelity

to the law and the set of facts or circumstances germane to the case before it.

Assuming an authority not bestowed on me and deviating from established

principles of our law in order to disseminate what I consider just per the context

of the dispute, beyond the set of circumstances presented for adjudication would

be most improper, and unjust. If Justice must be done, and must be seen to be

done, parties to proceedings and their advocates cannot be uncertain of the law

at the time they advocate their case. The success or failure of the legal arguments

of Counsel irreparably affect the rights of the parties they represent, and any

deviation from the settled understanding of this Court, in order to accommodate

the grievances of the Petitioners beyond the scope of what was lawful would

invariably lead to a debate on what may not give rise to a legitimate expectation

law. Hence, in my view, I am not permitted to determine the rights and

entitlements of the present parties in view of a larger social context, without

regard to the confines of the law. Such a pursuit would unfailingly impede

Justice. This does not however mean that the Court should restrain itself in a

manner which renders itself ineffectual in the face of grave injustice.

35) It is now evident that the 1st Respondent (the Mahaweli Authority) had made

several representations which were inconsistent with the laws and regulations

15

applicable to the subject matter. To permit such disregard for the law by public

authorities, who are beneficiaries and trustees of public resources would, in my

view be an abdication of this Courts duty. Therefore, while I do not hold that

the Petitioners bore a legitimate expectation of being granted permits to occupy

the lands they presently occupy, I hold that the Mahaweli Authority has been

remiss in permitting unlawful representations to be made. These representations

have led to the Petitioners harbouring hopes and expectations which, had they

been clarified in the first instance, the Petitioners would not have borne.

36) The Petitioners central grievance before this Court is that the failure on the part

of the Mahaweli Authority to give effect to the assurances given, breached their

legitimate expectations and that constitutes a violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution and that the Respondents were attempting to unlawfully evict the

Petitioners in violation of their Fundamental Rights. In the preceding paragraphs,

I have demonstrated how a legitimate expectation cannot arise upon an ultra

vires assurance or representation. Therefore, it follows that without a legitimate

expectation to be breached, the assurances of the Respondents, however

misconceived, or the failure to give effect to them, could not have violated the

Petitioners fundamental rights to equal protection of the law and equality before

the law guaranteed under Article 12(1). Furthermore, I observe that since the

Respondents had complied with the statutory scheme imposed by the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, they have not acted unlawfully in attempting to

evict the Petitioners. Therefore, I hold that the Respondents have not violated the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners.

37) This Court is vested with the jurisdiction to grant such relief or make such

directions as it may deem just and equitable in the circumstance [vide Article

126(4)] and it is now understood that the Court is not constrained in its

competence by the finding of a violation of a fundamental right in order to award

such relief [vide Noble Resources International Pte Limited Vs. Hon. Ranjith

Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Power and Renewable Energy & Others, S.C F.R No.

394/2015, S.C Minutes 24.06.2016]. What is just and equitable cannot surely

be interpreted to include what may be contrary to Stature, but it does include, in

my view, efforts to alleviate persons from unjustly bearing the consequences of

16

unreasonable, arbitrary, or unlawful conduct of Public Authorities. I am

conscious that the 1st Respondent authority had provided ultra vires assurances

on a matter so significant as a persons housing.

38) In view of the above, and for or all the reasons enumerated in the preceding

analysis, I direct the 1st Respondent Authority to once again offer alternative

lands to the Petitioners for relocation, pursuant to the alternative relief sought

in the Petition. Should the Petitioners choose to accept such relief, the 1st

Respondent must direct its officers and personnel to facilitate the granting of any

permits lawfully, per the requirements and stipulations of the National

Environmental Act and all the regulations promulgated therein. In the

circumstances, I make order retracting the stay-order issued vide Supreme Court

Minutes dated 23.09.2011 on the proceedings of the Magistrates Court of

Kandy in the following cases:

- Case No. 35033/11 against the 1st Petitioner

- Case No. 35028/11 against the 2nd Petitioner

- Case No. 33069/11 against the 3rd Petitioner.

A violation of fundamental rights has not been established.
