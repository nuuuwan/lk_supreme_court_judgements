"","the  version  of  the  1st  respondent.  Although  the  petitioner"
"","asserts  that  allegations  of  the  violation  of  Article  11  can  be"
"","proven  by  way  of  affidavits,  where  the  affidavits  in  question"
"","creates a doubt as to concoction or exaggeration it would be"
"","unsafe to act upon them."
"42.","It  can  be  observed  that,  while  the  case  of  Adhikary  and"
"","Another v. Amarasinghe and Others [2003] 1 S.L.R. 270"
"","seems to have certain factual similarities to the instant case,"
"","it has important and striking dissimilarities as to the points"
"","of law. The petitioner in the above case was assaulted by the"
"","respondents who were security officers of a minister without"
"","any  authority.  However,  in  the  instant  case,  a  warrant  has"
"","been  issued  by  the  Magistrate  and  the  respondent  police"
"","officers were exercising their lawful authority in arresting the"
"","petitioner  in  the  instant  case.    Therefore,  the  rationale  of"
"","that case cannot be applied in the instant case."
"43.","In  light  of  the  above  findings,  it  is  my  view  that,  there  has"
"","been  no  violation  of  the  rights  guaranteed  to  the  petitioner"
"","under  Article  11  of  the  Constitution.  I  cannot  comprehend"
"","how  effecting  an  arrest  by  the  use  of  minimum  force,  while"
"","the  person  against  whom  a  warrant  has  been 
issued 
is"
"","resisting arrest, would amount to a violation of Article 11 of"
"","the  Constitution  by  the  police.  If  this  is  allowed,  the  police"
"","officers  would  be  obstructed  from  carrying  out  their  official"
"","duties."
