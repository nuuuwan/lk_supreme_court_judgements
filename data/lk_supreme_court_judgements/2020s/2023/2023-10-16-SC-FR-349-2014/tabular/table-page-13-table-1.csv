"","person  making  the  arrest  may  use  such  means  as"
"","are reasonably necessary to effect the arrest.‚Äù"
"35.   It is clear that the petitioner in this case has resisted lawful",""
"","arrest.  Further,  when  perusing  the  document  marked  [A-6]"
"","and  the  affidavit  of  the  1st  respondent  where  it  has  clearly"
"","been  deposed  that,  when  the  petitioner  was  informed  of  the"
"","arrest,  she  has  vehemently  refused 
to  comply  with 
the"
"","warrant and has refused to part with her child. She has also"
"","refused to wear appropriate clothing and started shouting at"
"","the  police  in  a  threatening  manner.  Thereafter,  the  police"
"","officers  have 
pushed  her 
into 
the 
police 
jeep.  When"
"","considering  these  circumstances,  it  seems  to  me  that  the"
"","conduct  by  the  police  officers  in  pushing  the  petitioner  into"
"","the  police  jeep  was  reasonably  necessary  for  the  police  to"
"","effect  the  arrest  of  the  petitioner  who  was  resisting  arrest."
"","Police officers are duty bound to comply with the warrant of"
"","arrest. Therefore, it is clear that in the circumstances of this"
"","case, 
the  police 
officers  have  acted  within 
the  power"
"","conferred 
to 
them  under  section  23(2)  of 
the  Code  of"
"","Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979."
"36.","It has also been alleged by the petitioner that, the acts of the"
"","1st  respondent  have  caused  her  clothes  to  be  torn  and  she"
"","has been partially denuded and she has also had to travel to"
"","the  police  station  in  such  torn  clothing  in  the  presence  of"
"","male  police  officers.  This  has  been  denied  by 
the  1st"
"","respondent  in  his  affidavit.  When  perusing  the  affidavits  of"
"","the witnesses on behalf of the petitioner, it can be observed"
"","that, most of the witnesses have deposed that the petitioner"
"","was  partially  denuded  when  the  police  officer  carrying  out"
"","the arrest grabbed her in order to effect the arrest. However,"
"","in  the  affidavit  of  the  witness  marked  [P-8(c)]  it  has  been"
"","deposed  that,  one  of  the  police  officers  from  the  Welipenna"
"","police  station  have  ripped  off  the  upper  garments  of  the"
"","petitioner,  so  as  to  completely  denude  her  before  she  was"
"","pushed into the police jeep. This is patently an exaggeration."
