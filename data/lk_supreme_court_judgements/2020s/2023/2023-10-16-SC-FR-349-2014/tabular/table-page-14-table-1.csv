"37.  Further,  it  is  observed  that  the  petitioner  while  resisting",""
"","arrest was carrying her seven-month-old child in her hands."
"","When the police used minimum force to push her inside the"
"","police jeep, the petitioner has been carrying the child in her"
"","hands.  In  a  situation  such  as  this,  separating  the  infant"
"child 
from 
the  mother  would  be  more 
traumatic 
to","the"
"","mother and the child rather than allowing the child to be in"
"","the mother’s arms. Therefore, it is the petitioner’s resistance"
"to lawful arrest, that has led to these events.",""
"38.  With  regard  to  the","two-and-a-half-year-old  daughter,  the"
"","notes  made  by  the  officer  at  the  police  reserve  [A-6]  clearly"
"","sets  out  that,  the  daughter  had  been  subsequently  brought"
"","to the police station by relatives and kept within the custody"
"","of the petitioner. The 1st respondent in his affidavit has also"
"","stated  that  the  said  daughter  was  not  taken  in  the  police"
"","jeep  when  the  petitioner  was  arrested  but  that  she  was"
"","subsequently  brought  to  the  police  station  by  her  family."

the  conduct  of 
the  police 
in

children 
cannot

considered 
as","an"
"unnecessary and disproportionate response.",""

"","when  she  was  produced  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  of"
"","Mathugama on the day after the arrest, she has not informed"
"","the  Magistrate  as  to  what  had  transpired.  The  petitioner"
"","claims that, she was not permitted to make any statement in"
"","Court, nor could the petitioner complain of the  ill-treatment"
"","that was meted out to her by the police. The same position is"
"","taken by the husband of the petitioner in his affidavit [P-7]."
"However, 
the 
learned  Magistrate  has 
recorded 
that","the"
"petitioner  has 
explained  her  absence 
in  Court  on","the"
"","previous  occasion.  She  had  explained  how  she  had  been  in"
"","the  wrong  Court  room  when  the  case  was  being  called."
"Therefore, 
it","is  evident  that  the  petitioner  had  sufficient"
