"OIC.  When  considering  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the"
"instant  case,  the  alleged  torture  has  taken  place  outside  the"
"police  station.  The  arrest  that  was  carried  out  by  the  1st"
"respondent  and  the  subordinate  officers  was  a  lawful  arrest"
"carried out on the basis of a warrant and the 2nd respondent"
"had been away on official duty and in a practical sense there"
"is nothing that the 2nd respondent could have done to prevent"
"these  events.  Therefore,  due  to  the  striking  dissimilarities  in"
"the  instant  case  when  compared  with  the  above  case,  the"
"rationale in that case cannot be applied to the instant case."
