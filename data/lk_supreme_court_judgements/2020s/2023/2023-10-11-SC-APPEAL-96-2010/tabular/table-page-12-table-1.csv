"(19)","As will be made evident in a latter portion of this judgement, the consequence"
"","of conveying a property subject to life interest is most peculiar in effect for the"
"","purposes  of  prescription.  ‘Life  Interest’  is  a  unique  in  that  it  creates  a  legal"
"","endowment whereby a person who is bestowed such interest is legally entitled"
"","to enjoy the property. Therefore, the application of the proviso to Section 3 of"
"","the Prescription Ordinance also takes a unique form."
"(20)","This  court  is  inclined  to  agree  with  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"","Plaintiff  that  the  proviso  to  the  Section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance,  as"
"","propounded in Lesin v. Karaunaratne (supra) should apply to the present case."
"","By the application of the ratio in Lesin v. Karaunaratne (supra), prescription"
"","cannot  run  during  the  period  in  which  Rosa  enjoyed  life  interest  over  the"
"","property  as  against  her  children.  The  life  interest  would  have  come  to  a"
"","termination upon the death of the life interest holder Rosa in 1979 or in the"
"","alternative on the transfer of her rights to the 1st Defendant in 1975 by deed"
"","3361. For the purpose of resolving the question of law, it is immaterial whether"
"","we take into account the year 1975 or 1979 as the terminal point of Rosa’s life"
"","interest. However, as it would be more beneficial from the stand point of the"
"","Plaintiff to take the date as 1979, [in which case the proviso to Section 3 of the"
"","Ordinance  would  be  applicable  for  a  greater  period]  and  for  the  ease  of"
"","explaining  the  rationale  for  the  conclusions  reached  in  this  judgement,  the"
"","terminal point of Rosa’s life interest would be considered as the year 1979, the"
"","year in which she died."
"(21)","In view of the proviso to Section 3 of the Ordinance, by operation of law, the"
"","period Rosa enjoyed life interest over the corpus has to be discounted from the"
"","period of possession as far as the claim for prescription is concerned. However,"
"","there  are  a  number  of  factors  that  this  court  needs  to  consider  in  deciding"
"","whether the learned District Judge was correct in coming to the finding that"
"","the Defendants have established all requisites in Section 3 of the Ordinance to"
"","satisfy  that  they  [in  particular  the  7th  Defendant]  had  acquired  prescriptive"
