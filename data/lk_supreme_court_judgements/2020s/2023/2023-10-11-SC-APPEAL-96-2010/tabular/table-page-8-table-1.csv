"","Ordinance [hereinafter the ‘Ordinance’] ought to have been applied by both"
"","the District Court as well as the Court of Appeal. It was argued, however, that"
"","both the learned District judge as well as the Court of Appeal erred in not doing"
"","so. It was contended by the learned President’s Counsel that if the proviso was"
"","applied, the Defendants would not have been able to satisfy the court that there"
"","was an ouster and that they were in possession of the impugned property for a"
"","period  of  over  10  years,  two  of  the  requisites  that  need  to  be  established  to"
"","succeed in a claim for prescription."
"(7)","According to the Plaintiff, his father Adonis Gunasekera [hereinafter referred"
"","to as Adonis] was allotted 471/480th share of the corpus under the final decree"
"","entered in a partition action bearing No. P/2261 of the District Court of Galle."
"","There was no dispute among the parties of this fact. Adonis died in 1962 and"
"","his executor Metaramba Liyanage Elgin was substituted in the room and place"
"","of Adonis in the said partition case. The final decree of the District Court was"
"","delivered in 1965."
"(8)","Adonis had executed a Last Will in 1948 [No 1722; marked and produced as"
"","‘P2’ at the trial] which had been admitted to probate in case No. 8851 of the"
"","District  Court  of  Galle.  In  terms  of  the  said  Last  Will,  the  rights  of  Adonis"
"","accrued to his three children namely; (i) Therabhaya Gunasekera [Plaintiff in"
"","the instant case] (ii) Harishchandra Gunasekera and (iii) Asoka Gunasekera."
"","The  three  children  of  Adonis  referred  to  above,  however,  got  their  rights"
"","subject to the life interest of their mother Metaramba Liyanage Rosa [herein"
"","after referred to as Rosa]."
"(9)","It is also in evidence that one of Adonis’ children, Asoka Gunasekera passed"
"","away unmarried and issueless and Asoka’s interest devolved on their mother"
"","Rosa 
and 
the 
two 
remaining 
children 
Therabhaya 
[Plaintiff] 
and"
"","Harishchandra."
