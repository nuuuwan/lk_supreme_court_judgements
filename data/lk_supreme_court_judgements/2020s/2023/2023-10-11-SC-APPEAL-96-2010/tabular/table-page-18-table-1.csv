"(36)","Considering the statutory provisions and the weight of the judicial authority"
"","referred to above, I am of the view that; As far as this case is concerned,  the"

"","accrued life interest and again time started running from 1979 upon the death"

"","the Plaintiff approached him regarding the land in 1962, hence he had every"
"","opportunity to challenge the Defendants’  claim soon after the death of Rosa"
"","which  the  Plaintiff  failed  and  when  action  was  eventually  filed,  even  after"
"","discounting  the  period  Rosa  enjoyed  life  interest,  still  the  Defendants  had"
"","enjoyed adverse possession for more than 10 years when the two periods; Prior"
"","to Adonis’s death and subsequent to Rosa’s death are tacked on."
