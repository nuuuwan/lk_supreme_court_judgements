"(a)","There is no dispute that the 7th Defendant had come into possession of"
"","the property in 1954."
"(b)","It 
is  also  common  ground 
that 
the  7th  Defendant  and  his  family"
"","continued to possess the property since then without an interruption, a"
"","period of 30 years up to the date of action in the District Court."
"(c)","It is the position of the 7th Defendant that the land was ‘given’ to him by"
"","his 
father  with 
the  promise  of 
executing  a  deed  which  never"
"","materialised up to his father’s death in 1962."
"(d)","It is clear from the evidence that the possession that was given to the 7th"
"","Defendant  was  not  mere  ‘permission’  to  possess  but  with  a  declared"
"","intention of conveying its ownership to him by Adonis."
"(e)","It is in evidence that the 7th Defendant possessed the land, developed it,"
"","constructed buildings and there was corporeal occupation of the land"
"","attendant  with  manifest  to  hold  and  continue  it.  The  fact  that  the"

to  disturb 
the  7th"
"","Defendant’s possession after the death of the father, only makes it more"
"","certain  that  he  held  the  corpus  adversely  to  those  who  disputed  his"
"","rights."
