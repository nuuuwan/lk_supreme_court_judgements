"Although  it  may  not  be  directly  relevant,  a  parallel  can  be  drawn  to  the"
"application of Section 13 of the Ordinance which operates as an exception to"
"Section  3  of  the  Ordinance.  Section  13  operates  as  a  proviso  in  the  case  of"
"disabilities such as infancy, idiocy, unsoundness of mind, lunacy and absence"
"beyond  seas.  The  crux  of  the  principle  is  that  as  long  as  such  disability"
"continues, possession of such immovable property by any other person shall"
"not be taken as giving that person the rights under the Ordinance."
