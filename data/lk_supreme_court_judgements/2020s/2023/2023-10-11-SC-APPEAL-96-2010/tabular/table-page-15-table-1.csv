"","before us, the fact remains our courts have recognised in principle the ‘tacking"
"","on’  of  time  periods.  Balasingham  [Laws of Ceylon Volume 3, Part 2]  has"
"","expressed 
the  view 
that,  “for the purpose of computing this period of"
"","prescription the possession of the deceased person and his executor or heir and"
"","o
f
 
a
 
person and his particular successor whether legatee or purchaser, will be"
"","reckoned together”."
"(28)","If not for the supervening factor of Rosa having life interest, prescriptive rights"
"","of  the  Defendants  would  have  extended  as  against  the  Plaintiff  without  an"
"","interruption. Assuming that Adonis had died 9 years and 11 months after the"
"","7th  Defendant  had enjoyed  uninterrupted  and undisturbed possession  of  the"
"","property, to argue that the 7th Defendant has to prove that he had the requisite"
"","possession  for  ten  years,  commencing  from  the  death  of  Rosa  would  seem"
"","unreasonable."
"(29)","In  the  case  of  Casie Chetty v. Perera  (1886)  8  S.S.C  31,  dealing  with  the"
"","construction of the Ordinance relating to the phrase “... ten years previous to"
"","t
he bringing of such action”,  Berwick  D.  J.  expressed  the  view;  “The law is"
"","a
l
ways reasonable, or at least must be worked into reason when possible.”"
"(30)","The 
fact 
remains 
that 
the  7th  Defendant  had  exercised  uninterrupted"
"","possession  of  the  corpus  until  the  date  of  institution  of  the  action.  The  life"
"","interest vested in Rosa impeded his adverse possession only from the date of"
"","such conveyance till Rosa’s demise. Therefore, in my view, it would be more"
"","appropriate to state that his possession was suspended by operation of law, and"
"","not ‘interrupted’."
"(31)","I  take  this  view  in  consideration  of  the  overall  scheme  of  the  Prescription"
"","Ordinance and what it appears to have contemplated, as evident in the words"
"","of the Ordinance."
