S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner namely, Gunarathinam Manivannan (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) and the 12th Respondent are the hereditary trustees of the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Temple), a venerated place of

worship situated on the A9 Highway. Petitioner states that, since the 12th Respondent

is over 80 years of age, although she is a resident in Sri Lanka due to her advanced

age, she is not in a position to join in with the Petitioner in filing this application as a

co-trustee.

The Petitioner has made the instant application seeking relief in respect of the

infringement of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed under and in terms of the

Constitution, in the manner hereinafter more fully set out, against the Respondents.

The Petitioners instituted this action at the Supreme Court under Article 126 of the

Constitution, through Petition dated 2nd July 2010 against the 1st -13th Respondents

claiming that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as guaranteed by Articles 10,

12(1), 12(2), 14(1)(e) and 14(1)(f), 14(1)(h) of the Constitution have been infringed by

the Respondents. Further, an interim order restraining the 1st-11th Respondents and

those under them from causing any further destruction, alteration or new construction

to the land granted under the Crown Lease, constituting trust property on which the

said Temple and its temporalities stand. Moreover, an interim order directing the 1st -

11th Respondents to hand over to the Petitioner and the 12th Respondent the control

and management of the Temple and to restrain any commercial exploitation of the

Temple.

This matter was supported on 15th July 2010 and leave was granted under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution. The Respondents filed their Statement of objections, and the

Intervenient - Respondents, who are the devotees of the subject temple and

representing the Worshippers Society of the Thiru Murikandy Pillayar Temple, made

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 25

an application to intervene in this matter by their Petition dated 01st August 2012

seeking inter-alia the reliefs prayed for therein and the application for intervention was

allowed by this Court. Thereafter, when the matter came up on 17th October 2022 for

Argument, the parties made their respective oral submissions before this Court and at

the conclusion, the Court directed the parties to file their respective written

submissions.

I find it pertinent to establish the facts of this matter before addressing the issue of

violation of Fundamental rights.

Facts of this case

The Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent is the Minister of Buddhist and Religious

Affairs and in charge of the Buddhist and Religious Affairs Ministry, under whose

purview, formulation of policies and programmes to inculcate religious values among

people in order to create a virtuous society falls. Both the Department of Hindu

Religious and Cultural Affairs and the Department of Buddhist Affairs fall under the

said Ministry; the 2nd Respondent is the Director of the Department of Hindu Religious

and Cultural Affairs, and the Petitioners further that the 2nd Respondent together with

the 4th to 9th Respondents has, as hereinafter set out, acted contrary to the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed and protected under the

Constitution.

Petitioner states that the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its temporalities, the

subject matter of this application, is a place held in veneration by all and is situated on

the A9 Highway (Kandy to Jaffna), at Murikandy in Kilinochchi. It is said that all vehicles

plying the A9, be it towards Colombo or towards Jaffna, stop at the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil to pay their obeisance to the presiding Deity before proceeding. The

Petitioner's and the 12th Respondent's ancestor, Kathiresar Vythilingam, was an

engineer in the employment of the Crown and was posted to Thiru Murikandi in or

about the year 1880. During his time at Thiru Murikandi, a God called Pillayar (Pillayaar

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 25

is a Hindu God who is believed to remove obstacles) appeared in his dream and told

him that he, the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar, was in the new well that was being dug there

and to extricate him from the rock and to consecrate him at a Kovil there. Kathiresar

Vythilingam, as directed by the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar found the Deity in the well that

was being dug and was thereafter consecrated at the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil

with Kathiresar Vythilingam as the trustee of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and

built a home as well adjoining the Temple. In a short span of time, the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil became well known as a place of Hindu religious worship, and soon

thereafter, by a Deed dated 10th December 1886, a Crown Lease, in extent Two Acres

One Rood and Eight Perches (A2-R1-P8), including the land on which the temple and

its temporalities stood was granted in favour of the said Kathiresar Vythilingam in what

would appear to be in perpetuity. Upon the death of Kathiresar Vythilingam, the

trusteeship of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil devolved on his son Vythilingam

Kanagasabai. Upon the demise of the said Vythilingam Kanagasabai, the trusteeship

of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil devolved on his nephew Kandappar Sellappah and

his adopted son Ponnuthurai, who functioned as co-trustees of the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil.

Upon the demise of Kandappar Sellappah, his trusteeship devolved on his son

Sellappah Gunarathinam by virtue of deed No. 7429 dated 4th April 1967. Likewise,

Ponnuthurai, by a deed of donation dated 20th September 1951, passed on the

trusteeship to Thirunavukarasu Thanaledchumy, the daughter of Kandappah

Sellappah, the 12th Respondent. Thereafter, upon the demise of Sellappah

Gunarathinam on 6th October 1993, his rights of management and trusteeship of the

Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil devolved on the Petitioner, namely, Gunarathinam

Manivannan who is the only son of the said Sellappah Gunarathinam. From the

inception of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil, the Petitioner's and 12th Respondent's

ancestors had lived in very close proximity to the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil.

However, in or about the year 1990, the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam- A

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 25

militant group) forcibly took over the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its

temporalities, which forced the Petitioner's family, including the Petitioner, to flee to

India. Thereafter, the LTTE appointed their representatives to administer the Thiru

Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and collected all the income that accrued to the Thiru

Murikandi Pillayar Kovil. During the LTTE's administration of the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil, several shops sprung up in the vicinity of the Temple with the only aim

being the generation of income and without any concern whatever for the religiosity

and the sanctity of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its surroundings.

Petitioner states that, in 2003, during the ceasefire, when the A9 was diverted around

the Temple, which continues to date, the 12th Respondent's consent was sought and

obtained in this regard. After the military defeat of the LTTE, the Petitioner made

several attempts to speak to the relevant authorities in order that he, along with the

12th Respondent, may, as they lawfully might, resume the exercise of their legal right

to the management and control of Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its temporalities

as the lawful trustees thereof. However, upon visiting the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil,

the Petitioner was reliably informed, and he verily believes that the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil is now being managed and administered primarily by the 2nd Respondent

together with the 4th to 9th and 11th Respondents.

The Petitioner states that the continued management and administration of the Thiru

Murikandi Pillayar Kovil by the 2nd Respondent, together with the 4th to 9th and 11th

Respondents, is arbitrary, capricious, without any legal right or authority of whatsoever

nature and is violative of the Petitioner's Fundamental Rights enshrined and protected

under the Constitution.

The Petitioner, to his utter dismay, also found that the Viswamadu Cooperative Society,

the 8th Respondent, with the concurrence and/or collusion and/or permission of the

2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th and 11th Respondents, was running a Cooperative Store and a

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 25

restaurant at the building that was the Petitioners and 12th Respondents home prior

to their forcible eviction by the LTTE.

The Viswamadu Co-operative Society, the 8th Respondent, had caused serious and

extensive damage to the Petitioners home. The Petitioner also verily believes that the

Viswamdu Cooperative Society, the 8th Respondent, and/or its officers and/or its

agents and/or the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th and 11th have not taken any steps whatsoever

to prevent the consumption of alcohol in close proximity to the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil and are thus defiling and desecrating the sanctity of the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil.

The Petitioner further verily believes that moves are afoot to once again commercially

exploit the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its environs and thus defile the sanctity

of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil as was done by the LTTE.

The Petitioner has been reasonably informed and also verily believes that the

Viswamadu Cooperative Society, the 8th Respondent, is planning to make Several

structural changes/alterations to the Petitioners home, which is at least 130 years old

and that the said changes would completely alter the nature and character of the

Petitioners home and would render it unfit to be used as a home.

The Petitioner, by his letters dated 7th April 2010 addressed to the Government Agent

of Mullaitivu, the 5th Respondent, and the Assistant Government Agent of

Oddusuddan, Mullaitivu, the 6th Respondent, through the Grama Sevaka, the 7th

Respondent, informed them that he had returned to Sri Lanka upon the cessation of

the war and that his properties are being administered by the Government and

pleaded that his properties be returned to him and Petitioner annexed several

documents authenticating this claim.

The Petitioner, by letter dated 3rd May 2010, preferred an appeal to the 3rd

Respondent, Governor of the Northern Province, setting out his circumstances and

pleading that the Governor intervene in the matter. Thereafter, by letter dated 6th May

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 25

2010 addressed to the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner set out his current predicament

and requested that his properties be returned to him. Petitioner states that, regretfully,

none of the Petitioner's letters to the relevant authorities were even acknowledged or

replied.

In this background, the Petitioner was alarmed and perturbed to read a news item in

the "Uthayan" Newspaper of 21st May 2010 which stated that the Thiru Murikandi

Pillayar Kovil had been taken over by the Government and was being run by the

Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs by Shanthi Thirunavukkarasu, the

2nd Respondent. This news item further went on to state that in response to a query

posed to the 2nd Respondent regarding the same, she had stated that the Department

of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs was administering the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar

Kovil and had appointed a priest and a Manager and that once resettlement was

completed in the area the administration and control of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar

Kovil was to be handed over to representatives of the persons resettled. The Petitioner,

by Email of 21st May 2010, addressed to the "Uthavan' newspaper, set out the true

factual position regarding the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and stated that the

statements attributed to the 2nd Respondent appearing in the above-mentioned news

article were false.

Since no response whatsoever was forthcoming from the 2nd Respondent regarding

the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil, the Petitioner, once again by letter dated 12th June

2010 addressed to the 2nd Respondent and copied to Government Agent Mullaitivu,

Assistant Government Agent Oddusuddan, Grama Sevaka Thiru Murikandi, Governor

- Northern Province, Minister Douglas Devananda, The Prime Minister, Member of

Parliament Chandrakumar, set out yet again his claim to the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar

Kovil and its temporalities by annexing several documentation in proof of his claim.

The Petitioner alleged that, however, not even a single acknowledgement for the

letters was received from the 2nd Respondent, neither were any favourable steps taken

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 25

by the 2nd Respondent and/or any of the other Respondents to return to the Petitioner

and the 12th Respondent the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil and its temporalities.

Objections filed by the Respondents and Intervenient Respondent

The 2nd Res, the Director of Hindu Cultural Affairs, has filed an affidavit dated 29th

September 2010, stating that, the Temple has been managed by a Board of Trustees

since 1992 and has been administered as a Public Temple for the past 18 years; on the

request of the Public, the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs took over

the administration of the Temple in or about November 2009 and appointed a priest

to carryout religious ceremonies. Further, 2nd Respondent states that, on completion

of the resettlement process, the administration of the affairs of the Temple will be

handed to a committee comprising of the residents of the area and the as Petitioner

alleged, the Department of Hindu and Cultural Affairs is not responsible for any

construction activities in the vicinity.

The 9th Respondent, the Commissioner of Local Government has filed an affidavit

dated 5th January 2011, stating that the validity of the Crown Lease and the extent of

land granted thereby are matters to be established by the Petitioner in Court of Law;

there are many building which were previously controlled by the LTTE and thereafter

abandoned, hence private ownership in regard to lands would have to be established

in law; there are many land disputes in Killinochchi District and it is not practical for

the Governor to investigate these matters; the activities of the temple and the

surrounding lands are not matters that the Commissioner of Local Government is

involved with.

It was submitted on behalf of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th and 13th Respondents that, the

Petitioner's application is primarily in the nature of a vindicatory action in which he

seeks possession and control of the Temple and the administration of its affairs.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 25

Further, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th and 13th Respondents states that, they have not

dispossessed the Petitioner and the Petitioner according to his affidavit has

abandoned the temple and its premises in or about 1990 and has been away for a long

period of time, with no evidence of having controlled the affairs of the temple in that

period of absence of 18 years. In the circumstances, the Petitioner would have to

establish in a District Court, his right to control the Temple and the Administration of

its affairs.

The 4th Respondent submits that, the lease relied on by the Petitioner, was expired in

the absence of the renewal and, therefore, the Petitioner has no rights to the subject

matter. Further, it was submitted that the land is a State land given to Vythilingam

from whom the Petitioner claims that he is a hereditary trustee. The 4th Respondent

alleges that the Petitioner abandoned his trusteeship for a long time, and his claims

are prescribed in law. The 4th Respondent submits that, as far as concerned, the 4th

Respondent is a public-oriented body and is involved in serving the public. They have

constructed 46 peanut shops, 12 tea kiosks and a toilet to enable the worshippers and

the users of the road to ease themselves and buy pooja items. The money for the

construction of the shops is from public funds and entitled to collect rents and has no

duty to account to Petitioner.

The Intervenient-Respondent states that, in terms of Trusts Ordinance No.9 of 1917 as

amended and as the Petitioner claimed in paragraph 1 of the Petition, the place as a

venerated place of worship and when there are no Trustees, then an application has

to be made under Sections 75 and 76 of the Trusts Ordinance No.9 of 1917 as

amended with regard to the trusteeship. The Intervenient- Respondent alleges that,

there was no application made or no order was provided to that effect by the Petitioner

and there is no instrument of Trust was submitted or produced to court with regard to

the said claim by way of Hereditary Trustee by the Petitioner. In these circumstances,

a competent court should have issued an order under Section 112 of the Trusts

Ordinance. In this case, there was no such order produced by the Petitioner. In these

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 25

circumstances, the Petitioner has no status to file this application. The Petitioner

sought relief in the Petition on the basis that he is entitled to the management and

control of the "Thiru Murikandi Pilayar Kovil. But no order has been obtained or

produced under Section 75 or 76 or 112 of the Trusts Ordinance No.9 of 1917 as

amended.

Further, the Intervenient-Respondent states that the best interest of the devotees shall

be in the safe custody of the "State Institution" or a receiver appointed under Section

671 of the Civil Procedure Code by the District Court. In the event the Petitioner

establishes his right in the proper forum, namely "District Court", which has jurisdiction

to make an appropriate order in respect of the Religious Charitable Trust under the

Trusts Ordinance No. 09 of 1917 or under Section 671 of the Civil Procedure Code, the

Petitioner may claim by a Court order. In the absence of such court order, the Petitioner

has no right to file this application as the Petitioner has filed this application for his

personal and individual right as a hereditary Trustee.

The 12A Respondent states that the Petitioner and the 12th Respondent,

Thirunavukkarasu Thanaladchumy (She died pending the Case), are the hereditary

trustees of the Thiru Murikandy Pillayar Temple situated by the side of A9 road at

Murikandy in Kilinochchi and the other Respondents have illegally, unlawfully and

against the law applicable in the Country taken over the possession, administration,

maintenance and management of the Thiru Murikandy Pillayar Temple and its

temporalities after the end of civil war and thereby violated the fundamental rights of

the Petitioner and 12A Respondent.

The 12A Respondent states that the Trusteeship of the Petitioner and the 12th

Respondent is affirmed in the Supreme Court Case No. 115/1954, decided on 1st April

1955. The 12th Respondent is a party to the said case. Decree, Writ and the execution

papers of District Court of Vavuniya Case No. 826 are filed by the 12th Respondent

along with the Affidavit of the 12th Respondent.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 25

As per the submission of the 12A Respondent, the Pillayar (Vinayakar) was placed

under a tree by Great Grandfather of the 12th Respondent in the year 1884. He

constructed a small hut and maintained the Pillayar as a Vazhi Pillayar with the belief

that God protected their journey. The Thiru Murikandy Pillayar temple is a famous

"vazhi Pillayar' which means temple situated by the side of a road where the devotees

are people and passengers using the said road. Thus, these types of temples do not

have any permanent devotees. These temples are not traditional temples. In these

temples, there is no priest and there are no rights and rituals observed strictly.

The Temple is situated in the State Land. The State has, by a long-term lease, given the

land in extent of about Two and a half Acres (including the land where the temple is

situated) to the predecessors of the Petitioner and the 12A Respondent. Till 1990, the

Petitioner and the 12th Respondent and their predecessors to the Trust were in

possession, control, management and administration of the said temple and its

temporalities. Thereafter, the LTTE took control of the Kilinochchi district and

considering the "Till" collection from the said temple, LTTE took total control,

management and administration of the temple, which forced the Petitioner to flee to

India and the 12th Respondent to Nelliyadi in Point Pedro. The Petitioner and the 12th

Respondent were forcibly prevented from performing their duties as trustees due to

the said illegal and unlawful taking-over of the LTTE. The Petitioner and the 12th

Respondent did not have any place or forum to seek any effective relief against the

said acts of the LTTE. The above facts, such as the Trusteeship of the Petitioner and

12th Respondent, taking over of the Temple and its temporalities by the LTTE and its

control and fleeing of the Petitioner and 12th Respondent against their will, are

admitted by the 4th Respondent.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 18 of 25

Article 12(1) violation

The Petitioner and the 12A respondent in this application claim that the actions of the

Respondents have violated their fundamental rights under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides as follows;

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

The Petitioner filed this application on the basis that his fundamental rights have been

violated in as much as the State Institutions have taken over and managed the subject

temple of this application. The above facts, such as the Trusteeship of the Petitioner

and 12th Respondent, taking over of the Temple and its temporalities by the LTTE and

its control and fleeing of the Petitioner and 12th Respondent against their will are

admitted by the 4th Respondent in the Statements of Objection of the 4th Respondent.

As in the 6th Paragraph, it was stated that, the 2nd Respondent together with the 4th

Respondent and 9th Respondent did not act so as to deny the rights of the Petitioner and

the 12th Respondent, but to preserve and protect the temple which was abandoned by the

trustees from 1992 till the military took over". Further, in paragraph 16, it was stated as

"... the management and trusteeship of Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Temple was taken over

by LTTE from the year 1990. Therefore, the Petitioner and the 12th Respondent by flying

to India have lost their rights to be trustees."

Furthermore, in 20th, 21st and 22nd paragraph reads as follows, - ".... Petitioner and the

12th Respondent abandoned the said trusteeship, and thereby allowed the management

and control of Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Temple to be temporally managed by the

Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs and to do eventually taken over by

the Board of Trustees elected or selected by the worshipers once settlement of displaced

people is over.", "....as the Petitioner and 12th Respondent abandoned the said trust..., ....

as the Petitioner and the 12th Respondent failed to manage the trust and the right to

repossess. ...."

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 19 of 25

The above quotes, extracted from the Statement of Objections of the 4th Respondent

is proof of facts and admissions of the Trusteeship of the Petitioner and 12th

Respondent, taking over of the Temple and its temporalities by the LTTE and its control

and fleeing of the Petitioner and 12th Respondent against their will are admitted by the

4th Respondent. Further, as submitted above it is clearly established that the 12A

Respondent and the Petitioner are the hereditary trustees of the said Temple.

It is an admitted fact that the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs has

taken over the possession and administration of the Thiru Murikandy Temple and its

temporalities after the end of the civil war. The 2nd Respondent, who is the Director of

the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, has in her affidavit stated that

the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, on or about 9th November

2009, took over the administration of the Temple and appointed a priest to conduct

the pooja at the said Temple. Further, as per paragraphs 06, 20 and 22 of the

Statements of Objection of the 4th Respondent, in which the 4th Respondent has clearly

stated that the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs under the Ministry

of Cultural Affairs have taken over the temple and its temporalities.

As the 2nd and/or 4th respondents claimed, they did not submit any legal authority to

prove that they have power or authority whatsoever under any laws of the country to

take over the temple/temples on anyone's request and/or to regulate the

administration and management of any temple/temples. The 2nd Respondent is not

empowered to take over any temples in any manner whatsoever and for any reasons

whatsoever without any legal authority; therefore, I am of the view that the 2nd

Respondent had acted in contravening the law and the fundamental rights of

Petitioner.

Further, the 4th Respondent had failed to prove in which manner they got the authority

to collect the rents from the shops constructed by utilizing the money of public funds

offered for charitable purposes of the Temple. As the 2nd Res claimed in her Affidavit,

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 20 of 25

paragraph 8, the Department of Hindu and Religious Affairs nor the persons

administering the Temple are responsible for the purported constructions referred to

by the Petitioner and the said constructions, if any, are by private persons.

The 2nd Respondent and the 4th Respondent stated that there were requests from the

devotees to take over the temple, and as such, the 2nd Respondent took over the temple

and after the resettlement, the temple will be handed over to a committee elected by

the devotees. But there are no permanent devotees or worshipers to the said Vazhi

Pillayar Temple as it was a temple situated by the side of a road where the devotees

are people and passengers using the said road.

As it was submitted by the Respondents, I am of the view that Section 75 or 76 or 112

of the Trusts Ordinance No. 09 of 1917 will not apply to this application since the

Petitioner and the 12th Respondent as hereditary trustees of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar

Kovil did not abandoned their rights and responsibilities as trustees willfully but due to

the reason of civil war occurred they were forced to leave the area or the country for

their protection of lives.

Further, I am of the view that Section 102 of the Trusts Ordinance No. 09 of 1917 will

not apply to this application, since this Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil is a "Vazhi Pillayar

which means temple situated by the side of a road where the devotees are people and

passengers using the said road.

Decision

In the above premise, I am of the view that the acts and deeds of the Respondents are

arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, without authority and without any legal basis and

violated the Fundamental Rights of the 12th Respondent and the Petitioner under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Therefore, I order the 1st to 11th Respondents or any

one or more of them to hand over the management and control of the Thiru Murikandi

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 21 of 25

Pillayar Kovil, its temporalities and the appurtenant land constituted in the Crown

Lease marked and annexed as P1 of the Petition. Further, I direct the 1st- 11th

Respondents not to interrupt the trusteeship of the Temple and the land on which the

temple and its temporalities stand.

Application Allowed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

JANAK DE SILVA, J

I have had the benefit of reading in draft, the judgment proposed to be delivered by

my brother Thurairaja, J. As I am respectfully not in agreement with it, I have written

this dissenting judgment.

I do not wish to set out the factual circumstances in great detail as my brother has

done so. I will refer to them to the extent required to explain my conclusions.

The Petitioner claims that he is a hereditary trustee of the Thiru Murikandi Pillayar Kovil

(Kovil), which is undoubtedly a venerated place of Hindu religious worship. The State

land forming the subject matter of this application was leased in perpetuity to

Kathiresar Vythilingam, an ancestor of the Petitioner. It is claimed that the LTTE forcibly

took over the Kovil and property around 1990. The Petitioner and his family were

forced to flee to India.

After the military defeat of the LTTE, the Kovil and properties have been managed by

the 2nd, 4th to 9th and 11th Respondents. The Petitioner is seeking to recover possession

and control of the Kovil and properties.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 22 of 25

As I held in Centre for Environmental Justice (Guarantee) Ltd. v. Anura

Satharasinghe, Conservator General and Others [C.A. 291/2015, C.A.M.

06.11.2020 at pages 5,14], there is a need to settle down all internally displaced

persons, who were displaced due to the war in Sri Lanka, as far as possible in the areas

where they were residing. However, this is subject to other overriding concerns and,

above all, the respect for the rule of law, which is the foundation of our Constitution.

There is no unequivocal admission by the Respondents that the Kovil and its properties

are trust property or that the Petitioner is a hereditary trustee. Admittedly, paragraphs

6, 16, 20, 21 and 22 of the statement of objections of the 4th Respondent may be

understood in that sense. Nevertheless, in paragraph 3 thereon, it is clearly claimed

that the state land leased in 1880 to Kathiresan Vythilingam has expired. Moreover, it

is asserted that Kathiresan Vythilingam or his heirs are not the owners of the said land

and cannot claim hereditary trusteeship. Hence, the position of the 4th Respondent on

these two issues is equivocal.

The Petitioner relies on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ceylon (P3). It is one made

in an appeal between Velupillai Thirunavukkarasu and Kandappar Sellappah and

Chelliah Ponnadurai. The State was not a party to that case. Moreover, it is based on a

settlement decree between the parties.

The 2nd Respondent states that the Kovil is been managed by a Board of Trustees since

1992 and has been administered as a public Kovil for more than 18 years as at the time

the affidavit was attested in 2010. At the request of the public, the Department of

Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs took over the administration of the Kovil in or

about November 2009 and appointed a priest to carry out religious ceremonies. On

completion of the resettlement process, the administration of the Kovil will be handed

over to a committee comprising the residents of the area.

In this context, it is incumbent on the Court to examine the claim made by the

Petitioner that the land forming the subject matter of this application is trust property.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 23 of 25

In terms of section 3 of the Trusts Ordinance No. 17 of 1917 as amended (Trusts

Ordinance), trust is an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising

out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner, or declared and accepted

by him, for the benefit of another person, or of another person and the owner, of such

a character that, while the ownership is nominally vested in the owner, the right to the

beneficial enjoyment of the property is vested or to be vested in such other person, or

in such other person concurrently with the owner.

In Fernando v. Sivasubramaniam Aiyer (61 NLR 241 at 243), it was held that no

particular formula is required by law for the creation of a trust. The requirement of law

is that the author should make his meaning clear and evince his intention to create a

trust, and the Court will give effect to that intention.

However, there is nothing on the face of the Crown Lease (P1) which indicates that the

Crown (then) intended it to form part of a religious trust or trust property. A clear typed

copy of P1 has been produced by the State with motion dated 16th May 2018. It is a

lease granted in the name of Kathiresan Vayittilingam and his heirs and assigns in free

and common socage forever on the payment of an annual quit-rent. In that sense, it

appears to be a lease in perpetuity as claimed by the Petitioner. However, it permits

the State to enter upon the land for reasons specified therein. In my view, the contents

of the said lease do not support the claim of the Petitioner that it is part of a Hindu

religious trust.

No doubt, section 107 of the Trusts Ordinance permits the Court to assume an implied

trust if it is of the opinion from all the circumstances of the case that the trust, in fact,

exists, or ought to be deemed to exist. However, no such material is available before

the Court.

Hence, in my view, the application of the Petitioner must fail on the ground that it has

not been established that the State land forming the subject matter of this application

has been shown to be part of the trust property in question.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 24 of 25

Even if one assumes that it is so established, the question of hereditary trusteeship and

control over the State land must be addressed.

In examining these two issues, it must be borne in mind that there are two distinct and

different modes associated with the devolution of trust property, one in regard to title

and the other in regard to the office of trusteeship. The relevant principles have been

succinctly stated in Kumaraswamy Kurukkal v. Karthigesu Kurukkal (26 N.L.R. 33),

Karthigasu Ambalawanar v. Subramaniar Kathiravelu (27 N.L.R. 15) and Letchi

Raman Balasunderam and Others v. Kalimuttu Letchi Raman and Others [(79) I

N.L.R. 361]. They are as follows:

When a person who owns a land dedicates it for the purpose of religious worship or

transfers it to a temple, the effect of his doing so is to constitute himself a trustee for

a charitable trust for the purpose of the religious worship to be carried out at the

temple.

The legal title or dominium remains with the dedicator or the author of the trust and,

on his death, passes to his heirs subject to the obligations of the trust, the heirs being

constructive trustees.

The legal ownership or dominium does not ordinarily devolve with the office of trustee.

Upon the death of the trustee, in whom legal title is vested to the property, the legal

ownership does not pass to the new trustee. In the absence of any formal instrument,

it will pass to the trustee's heirs, who will hold it subject to the trust.

In so far as the devolution of trusteeship is concerned, Vythilingam Kanagasabai is said

to have inherited the trusteeship from Kathiresan Vythilingam. Nevertheless, there is a

question mark over the devolution thereafter. It is said that it devolved in equal shares

to Kandappar Sellappah, his nephew and Ponnuthurai, his adopted son. How they

became the heirs of Vythilingam Kanagasabai is not established.

SC FR 393/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 25 of 25

Moreover, the 14th and 15th Respondents, who are worshippers of the Kovil and the

President and Secretary, respectively, of the Kovil Worshippers Council, state that the

management of the Kovil should not be left to individuals or to a Government

Department of Ministry. They further state that the Kovil should be managed by the

Hindus, and they should not be politically involved in any manner. It is claimed that

either they or the 12th Respondent are in law entitled to possession, management or

control of the Kovil.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the

State land in issue is trust property. Neither has he succeeded in establishing that he

is an heir of Vythilingam Kanagasabai or a trustee. Hence, I refuse to grant the relief

claimed by the Petitioner.

In conclusion, I wish to state that my conclusions are based on the evidence placed

before the Court. It should not prevent the Petitioner from seeking to establish both

matters before any other Court in appropriate proceedings. In fact, most of the

Respondents claim that these matters are more suitable to be determined as provided

for in the Trusts Ordinance.

Application dismissed. No costs.
