"As  per  the  submission  of  the  12A  Respondent,  the  Pillayar  (Vinayakar)  was  placed"
"under  a  tree  by  Great  Grandfather  of  the  12th  Respondent  in  the  year  1884.  He"
"constructed a small hut and maintained the Pillayar as a Vazhi Pillayar with the belief"
"that  God  protected  their  journey.  The  Thiru  Murikandy  Pillayar  temple  is  a  famous"
"""vazhi Pillayar' which means temple situated by the side of a road where the devotees"
"are people and passengers using the said road. Thus, these types of temples do not"
"have  any  permanent  devotees.  These  temples  are  not  traditional  temples.  In  these"
"temples, there is no priest and there are no rights and rituals observed strictly."
"The Temple is situated in the State Land. The State has, by a long-term lease, given the"
"land in extent of about Two and a half Acres (including the land where the temple is"
"situated) to the predecessors of the Petitioner and the 12A Respondent. Till 1990, the"
"Petitioner  and  the  12th  Respondent  and  their  predecessors  to  the  Trust  were  in"
"possession,  control,  management  and  administration  of  the  said  temple  and 
its"
"temporalities.  Thereafter, 
the  LTTE 
took  control  of 
the  Kilinochchi  district  and"
"considering  the  ""Till""  collection 
from  the  said  temple,  LTTE  took  total  control,"
"management and administration of the temple, which forced the Petitioner to flee to"
"India and the 12th Respondent to Nelliyadi in Point Pedro. The Petitioner and the 12th"
"Respondent were forcibly prevented from performing their duties as trustees due to"
"the  said  illegal  and  unlawful  taking-over  of  the  LTTE.  The  Petitioner  and  the  12th"
"Respondent did not have any place or forum to seek any effective relief against the"
"said acts of the LTTE. The above facts, such as the Trusteeship of the Petitioner and"
"12th Respondent, taking over of the Temple and its temporalities by the LTTE and its"
"control  and  fleeing  of  the  Petitioner  and  12th  Respondent  against  their  will,  are"
"admitted by the 4th Respondent."
