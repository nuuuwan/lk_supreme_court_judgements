"In  terms  of  section  3  of  the  Trusts  Ordinance  No.  17  of  1917  as  amended  (“Trusts"
"Ordinance”), “trust” is an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising"
"out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner, or declared and accepted"
"by him, for the benefit of another person, or of another person and the owner, of such"
"a character that, while the ownership is nominally vested in the owner, the right to the"
"beneficial enjoyment of the property is vested or to be vested in such other person, or"
"in such other person concurrently with the owner."
"In Fernando v. Sivasubramaniam Aiyer (61 NLR 241 at 243), it was held that no"
"particular formula is required by law for the creation of a trust. The requirement of law"
"is that the author should make his meaning clear and evince his intention to create a"
"trust, and the Court will give effect to that intention."
"However, there is nothing on the face of the Crown Lease (P1) which indicates that the"
"Crown (then) intended it to form part of a religious trust or trust property. A clear typed"
"copy of P1 has been produced by the State with motion dated 16th May 2018. It is a"
"lease granted in the name of Kathiresan Vayittilingam and his heirs and assigns in free"
"and common socage forever on the payment of an annual quit-rent. In that sense, it"
"appears to be a lease in perpetuity as claimed by the Petitioner. However, it permits"
"the State to enter upon the land for reasons specified therein. In my view, the contents"
"of the said lease do not support the claim of the Petitioner that it is part of a Hindu"
"religious trust."
"No doubt, section 107 of the Trusts Ordinance permits the Court to assume an implied"
"trust if it is of the opinion from all the circumstances of the case that the trust, in fact,"
"exists, or ought to be deemed to exist. However, no such material is available before"
"the Court."
"Hence, in my view, the application of the Petitioner must fail on the ground that it has"
"not been established that the State land forming the subject matter of this application"
"has been shown to be part of the trust property in question."
