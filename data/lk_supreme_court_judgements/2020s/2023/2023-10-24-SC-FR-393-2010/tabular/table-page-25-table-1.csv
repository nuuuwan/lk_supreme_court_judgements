"Moreover, the 14th and 15th Respondents, who are worshippers of the Kovil and the"
"President and Secretary, respectively, of the Kovil Worshippers Council, state that the"
"management  of  the  Kovil  should  not  be  left  to  individuals  or  to  a  Government"
"Department of Ministry. They further state that the Kovil should be managed by the"
"Hindus, and they should not be politically involved in any manner. It is claimed that"
"either they or the 12th Respondent are in law entitled to possession, management or"
"control of the Kovil."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the"
"State land in issue is trust property. Neither has he succeeded in establishing that he"
"is an heir of Vythilingam Kanagasabai or a trustee. Hence, I refuse to grant the relief"
"claimed by the Petitioner."
"In conclusion, I wish to state that my conclusions are based on the evidence placed"
"before the Court. It should not prevent the Petitioner from seeking to establish both"
"matters  before  any  other  Court  in  appropriate  proceedings.  In  fact,  most  of  the"
"Respondents claim that these matters are more suitable to be determined as provided"
"for in the Trusts Ordinance."
"Application dismissed. No costs."
