"Even if one assumes that it is so established, the question of hereditary trusteeship and"
"control over the State land must be addressed."
"In examining these two issues, it must be borne in mind that there are two distinct and"
"different modes associated with the devolution of trust property, one in regard to title"
"and the other in regard to the office of trusteeship. The relevant principles have been"
"succinctly stated in Kumaraswamy Kurukkal v. Karthigesu Kurukkal (26 N.L.R. 33),"
"Karthigasu Ambalawanar v. Subramaniar Kathiravelu (27 N.L.R. 15) and Letchi"
"Raman Balasunderam and Others v. Kalimuttu Letchi Raman and Others [(79) I"
"N.L.R. 361]. They are as follows:"
"When a person who owns a land dedicates it for the purpose of religious worship or"
"transfers it to a temple, the effect of his doing so is to constitute himself a trustee for"
"a  charitable  trust  for  the  purpose  of  the  religious  worship  to  be  carried  out  at  the"
"temple."
"The legal title or dominium remains with the dedicator or the author of the trust and,"
"on his death, passes to his heirs subject to the obligations of the trust, the heirs being"
"constructive trustees."
"The legal ownership or dominium does not ordinarily devolve with the office of trustee."
"Upon the death of the trustee, in whom legal title is vested to the property, the legal"
"ownership does not pass to the new trustee. In the absence of any formal instrument,"
"it will pass to the trustee's heirs, who will hold it subject to the trust."
"In so far as the devolution of trusteeship is concerned, Vythilingam Kanagasabai is said"
"to have inherited the trusteeship from Kathiresan Vythilingam. Nevertheless, there is a"
"question mark over the devolution thereafter. It is said that it devolved in equal shares"
"to  Kandappar  Sellappah,  his  nephew  and  Ponnuthurai,  his  adopted  son.  How  they"
"became the heirs of Vythilingam Kanagasabai is not established."
