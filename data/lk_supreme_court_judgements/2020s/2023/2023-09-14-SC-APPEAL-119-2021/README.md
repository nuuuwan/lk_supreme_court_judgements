Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner namely Lushantha Karunarathna (hereinafter and

sometimes referred to as the Applicant) by the Employer Respondent-Appellant-

Respondent Company namely Asia Broadcasting Corporation (Pvt) Ltd (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Respondent) based on the alleged charges levelled

against him in relation to a hoarding site situated on Maya Avenue, Wellawatte, on

grounds of gross misconduct in the form of negligence in executing his obligations as

the Senior Manager of Promotions of Shaa FM. Upon application to the Labour

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 21

Tribunal by the Applicant, the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal by Order dated

16th March 2018 pronounced the aforesaid termination by the Respondent to be

unjustifiable and inequitable, whereby the Applicant was awarded Rs. 936,000 as

compensation. This decision was overturned by the High Court by Order dated 31st

May 2019, where the Learned High Court Judge held in favour of the Respondent

company. Being aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Applicant has now

preferred this appeal by way of Petition dated 28th June 2019 praying that the Order

dated 31st May 2019 of the High Court be set aside and the Order of the Labour

Tribunal dated 16th March 2018 be restored.

When the instant case was considered for leave to appeal before the Supreme Court

on 13th December 2021, the Court granted special leave to appeal on the following

two questions of law.

(i) Did the High Court consider whether the findings of the Labour Tribunal

were perverse?

(ii) If the findings of the Labour Tribunal were not perverse, did the High

Court err in law by allowing the appeal preferred by the Employer

Respondent?

Facts

The Respondent company is the owner and the operator of several media channels in

Sri Lanka including Hiru TV, Hiru FM, Shaa FM, Suriyan FM, Gold FM and Sun FM. The

Applicant first joined the Respondent company as a Junior Executive Officer of

Promotions on or around 09th August 1999, and, on or around 09th June 2008 while

holding the position of Assistant Manager of Promotions, the Applicant had resigned

to be employed elsewhere. More recently, the Applicant was re-employed at Shaa FM

on 18th September 2012, and was thereafter promoted to the position of Senior

Manager of Promotions, which was the position the Applicant held at the time of the

termination of employment. As the Senior Manager of Promotions, the Applicant was

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 21

required to attend to all promotional activities of the Respondent Company, including

the installation and maintenance of hoarding sites of the Respondent Company. The

hoardings were owned by the third-party advertising companies, and the Respondent

would obtain such hoarding on the basis of an annually renewable contract.

The instant case concerns a hoarding site installed at Maya Avenue, Wellawatta upon

the instructions of the Chairman of the Respondent company on or around 19th

October 2012, in respect of which the Respondent entered into a contract with Regee

Advertising (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the advertising company), which

was overseen by the Applicant. The Respondent company had an established standard

practice in respect of the installation and maintenance of hoarding sites which has

been acknowledged by both parties during the cross examination and has been

summarised by the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal in the following manner.

(vide pg.227 of the High Court brief).

advertising

. ,

.

I have provided an approximate and unofficial translation of the above extract below.

The practice is that after the advertising agency informs the Respondent

Company of its advertising opportunities, and before deciding whether to

buy the site, the Respondent company conducts some research to determine

whether it would suit the needs of the company, and thereafter calls for

quotations, after which, an on-site inspection takes place allowing the

relevant manager of the Respondent company to present it to the Chairman

of the Respondent company for approval for purchase. If approval is

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 21

received, the parties proceed with the purchase. If not, other hoarding sites

will be considered.

Witness for the Respondent company, namely Dilanka de Soysa (hereinafter referred

to as the Witness for the Respondent) gave evidence and during the cross-

examination, stated that he was asked by the Chairman of the Respondent company

to inspect the hoarding site in question. Having inspected the same, the Witness for

the Respondent had not taken photographs of the site, although he had admitted that

generally when conducting routine inspections, he would take photographs of the

respective sites. In respect of the hoarding site in question, he was asked to inspect

the site for the purpose of affirming whether any disturbances were caused to the

hoarding site, and he had been given pictures by the Human Resources Department

for comparison purposes (vide pg.41-42 of the High Court Brief.)

Though the usual practice was to take photographs during inspections, he had not

done on that occasion, but instead, used the photographs provided by the Human

Resources Department of the Respondent Company to ascertain whether there was an

obstacle caused to the hoarding site. Upon arrival at the site, he observed minor

disturbances to the hoarding site caused by buildings and trees. The witness also

stated that any disturbance resulting from overgrown vegetation could be removed

by informing the relevant advertising agency. Further, he states that, as the person

who inspected the alleged disturbance to the hoarding, he was not asked to testify

before the domestic inquiry held within the Respondent company in relation to this

matter.

The Applicant testified before the Labour Tribunal stating that the said hoarding site

was selected by the Chairman of the Respondent Company and was instructed to

obtain it for advertising and was done so having followed the established standard

practice followed by the Respondent company. The hoarding site was initially obtained

in the year 2012 and subsequently the contract was extended for another year with

the approval of the Chairman of the Respondent Company. In the two years that the

hoarding site was in use, there were no concerns raised either by the Respondent

Company, or its chairman regarding the visibility of the hoarding site. The issue with

the visibility of the hoarding site was raised for the first time when the contract was

scheduled to be extended for a second time, and further questions arose as to another

hoarding board at the vicinity of the hoarding site in question. The Applicant stated

that he had tried to convince the Chairman by using photographs taken from time to

time that the so-called new hoarding board had always been there and that it was not

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 21

a newly erected one. Not being convinced by the explanation of the Applicant, the

Respondent had issued the Petitioner with a Charge sheet, and after having conducted

a domestic inquiry, the employment of the Applicant was terminated.

At the end of the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal, both parties filed their respective

written submissions together with marked documents. The Learned President of the

Labour Tribunal pronouncing the order on 16th March 2018, ordered the Respondent

company to pay 12-months salary as compensation based on the findings that the

Respondent Company had unreasonably terminated the services of the Applicant.

Among such other findings, the Labour Tribunal stated that though the Chairman of

the Respondent company had made such allegations against the Applicant, the

Chairman was not available as a witness before the Labour Tribunal, that the witness

who testified on behalf of the Respondent before the Labour Tribunal had not been

called to testify at the domestic inquiry, that the witness had failed to submit a report

with photographs thereby failing to adhere to the standard practice followed when

conducting such inspections, that as admitted by the Respondent witness, any

disturbances caused by the overgrowth of vegetation could have been cured by

informing the advertising company as it was a matter beyond the control of the

Applicant.

The Respondent in challenging the Order made by the Labour Tribunal, preferred an

appeal before the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo.

The Respondent states that the Chairman had merely suggested to the Applicant that

there should be a hoarding site in the area and that it was the Applicants duty to go

and inspect the site and determine whether a hoarding would be suitable for

advertising, and if so, to proceed to install such a hoarding. It thereafter had come to

the attention of the Respondent that the said hoarding was partially obstructed by

trees growing from a private property and a light pole, and the Applicant without

having considered these obstructions and without notifying the Chairman, has

renewed the contract with Regee Advertising up until 10th January 2015.

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 21

The matter was argued before the Learned High Court Judge on 26th April 2019, and

the question of law arose as to whether the Respondent Company has proved to the

satisfaction of the court the negligence of the Applicant with regard to the renewal of

the contract of the hoarding site in question. By Order dated 31st May 2019, the

Learned High Court Judge found that in light of the facts and circumstances of the

instant case the Respondent was right to have terminated the employment of the

Applicant, giving emphasis to the importance of a hoarding site to a company such as

the Respondent company, and also noted that the Applicant had failed to inspect and

maintain the site after its installation which fell within the ambit of the Applicants

scope of the work as the Senior Manager of Promotions. The Learned High Court Judge

also observed that the Applicant had failed to disclose in the show cause letter dated

27th January 2015, and failed to tender evidence before the Labour Tribunal as to what

he ought to have done to rectify the issue of visibility caused by the overgrowth of

vegetation. It was further held that the Labour Tribunal when exercising its just and

equitable jurisdiction must ensure that such an order rendered is just and equitable to

both parties to the application.

Therefore, the Learned High Court Judge found that in light of the facts and

circumstances of the instant case the Respondent was right to have terminated the

employment the Applicant, setting aside the Order of the Labour Tribunal.

Being aggrieved by the decision of the Learned High Court judge, the Applicant by

Petition dated 28th June 2019 has made an application before this Court praying that

the Order of the Labour Tribunal dated 16th March 2019 be restored and the Order of

the High Court dated 31st May 2019 be set aside. On 13th December 2021, the Supreme

Court granted special leave to appeal on the two questions of law as stated above.

Analysing the existing legal position relevant to the instant case

As statutorily encapsulated within the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 as

amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Industrial Disputes Act), s.31D (2)

provides as follows.

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 21

An order of a labour tribunal shall be final and shall not be called in

question in any court.

[Emphasis added]

However, s.31D(2) does not render is impossible for an aggrieved party to prefer an

appeal to another court, as this rule is subject to s.31D(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act

which reads as follows.

Where the workman who, or the trade union which, makes an application

to a labour tribunal, or the employer to whom that application relates is

dissatisfied with the order of the tribunal on that application, such workman,

trade union or employer may, by written petition in which the other party is

mentioned as the respondent, appeal from that order on a question of law,

to the High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution, for the

Province within which such Labour Tribunal is situated

[Emphasis added]

In Kotagala Plantations Ltd. and Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantations (Pvt) Ltd. v

Ceylon Planters Society [(2010) 2 Sri LR 299] by Chief Justice J.A.N de Silva as to

what would constitute a question of law for the purposes of s.31D of the Industrial

Disputes Act, whereby His Lordship held at page 303 as follow:

An appeal lies from an order of a Labour Tribunal only on [a] question of

law. A finding on facts by the Labour Tribunal is not disturbed in appeal by

an Appellate Court unless the decision reached by the Tribunal can be

considered to be perverse. It has been well established that for an order to

be perverse the finding must be inconsistent with the evidence led or

that the finding could not be supported by the evidence led (vide

Caledonian Estates Ltd. v. Hillman 79 (1) NLR 421)

[Emphasis added]

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 21

Further, in Jayasuriya vs Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation, (1995) 2 SLR 379

Justice Amarasinghe held that being "perverse" in this context can have a broader

meaning than its natural meaning. His lordship held;

"Perverse" is an unfortunate term, for one may suppose obstinacy in what

is wrong, and one thinks of Milton and how Satan in the Serpent had

corrupted Eve, and of diversions to improper use, and even of subversion

and ruinously turning things upside down, and, generally, of wickedness.

Yet, in my view, in the context of the principle that the Court of Appeal will

not interfere with a decision of a Labour Tribunal unless it is "perverse", it

means no more than that the court may intervene if it is of the view that,

having regard to the weight of evidence in relation to the matters in issue,

the tribunal has turned away arbitrarily or capriciously from what is true

and right and fair in dealing even handedly with the rights and interests

of the workman, employer and, in certain circumstances, the public. The

Tribunal must make an order in equity and good conscience, acting

judicially, based on legal evidence rather than on beliefs that are fanciful

or irrationally imagined notions or whims. Due account must be taken of

the evidence in relation to the issues in the matter before the Tribunal.

Otherwise, the order of the Tribunal must be set aside as being perverse."

Justice Amarasinghe went on to recognise several grounds on which the appellate

courts have intervened with the orders of the labour tribunal and set them aside, which

demonstrate the scope of the concept of perversity. These grounds were summarized

by Justice Arjuna Obeysekara in the recent unreported case of R.A. Dharmadasa v

Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, (SC Appeal No 13/2019 decided on 16th June

2022) whereby the findings of a Labour Tribunal were subject to review if it was,

wholly unsupported by evidence (Ceylon Transport Board v.

Gunasinghe [(1973) 72 NLR 76], Colombo Apothecaries Co. Ltd v. Ceylon

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 21

Press Workers Union [(1972) 75 NLR 182], Ceylon Oil Workers Union v.

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation [(1978-9) 2 Sri LR 72]), or

which is inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it

(Reckitt & Colman of Ceylon Ltd v. Peiris [(1978-9) 2 Sri LR 229]), or

where the Tribunal has failed to consider material and relevant

evidence (United Industrial Local Government & General Workers Union

v. Independent Newspapers Ltd [(1973) 75 NLR 529]), or

where it has failed to decide a material question (Hayleys Ltd v. De

Silva [(1963) 64 NLR 130]), or

misconstrued the question at issue and has directed its attention

to the wrong matters (Colombo Apothecaries Co. Ltd v. Ceylon Press

Workers Union [supra]), or

where there was an erroneous misconception amounting to a

misdirection (Ceylon Transport Board v. Samastha Lanka Motor Sevaka

Samithiya [(1964) 65 NLR 566]), or

where it failed to consider material documents or misconstrued

them (Virakesari Ltd v. Fernando [(1965) 66 NLR 145]), or

where the Tribunal has failed to consider the version of one party

or his evidence (Carolis Appuhamy v. Punchirala [(1963) 64 NLR 44],

Ceylon Workers Congress v. Superintendent, Kallebokke Estate [(1962) 63

NLR 536]), or

erroneously supposed there was no evidence (Ceylon Steel

Corporation v. National Employees Union [(1969) 76 CLW 64])

[Emphasis added]

It has come to my attention that several facts which were admitted by the witness on

behalf of the Respondent during the cross-examination have not been taken into

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 21

consideration by the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal in his Order, which have

been summarized below. First, the charges against the Applicant were raised by the

Chairman of the Respondent Company, who was not called as a witness before the

Labour Tribunal to testify on behalf of the Respondent. Second, the witness who did

testify on behalf of the Respondent was not called to testify at the domestic inquiry

held by the Respondent. Third, in determining whether the termination of the

Applicant was justifiable, what ideally should have been considered was whether

termination was the right course of action on the part of the Respondent instead of

construing whether the Applicant was at fault. Even so, the President of the Labour

Tribunal held that the Applicant was not negligent in his duties and thereby his

termination of employment was unjustified and inequitable.

I am in agreement with the decision of the Labour Tribunal to compensate the

Applicant for the termination of employment. However, I do not agree with the finding

that the Applicant was not negligent. Had the aforementioned facts been taken into

consideration and had the Chairman of the Respondent Company been called to

testify before the Labour Tribunal, the Labour Tribunal would have found the

Applicants failure to rectify any disturbances caused to the hoardings to amount to

negligence of his part. On this factual point alone, I agree with the findings of the

Learned High Court Judge. However, I do not agree with the final decision of the High

Court to not compensate the Applicant. Thus, the findings of the Labour Tribunal

would be construed as partially perverse on this particular fact on the grounds that the

Labour Tribunal has misconstrued the question at issue and had failed to consider the

views of the Respondent Company, which falls within the meaning of perversity as

summarized by my brother Judge in R.A. Dharmadasa v Board of Investment of Sri

Lanka, (supra).

Yet, the length and breadth of the two questions of law cannot be answered if one was

to limit the instant case to the question of the alleged perversity of the findings of the

Labour Tribunal. Thus, it is my view that the questions of law in instant case can be

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 21

addressed in light of the following two factual observations which provides a larger

and clearer picture to the issues at hand. First, I find that the Applicant has in fact acted

negligently in executing his duties as the Senior Manager of Promotions, since

advertising is vital to a company operating in the media industry, and this falls directly

within the Applicants scope of work, which has been to a certain extent identified and

elaborated by the Learned High Court Judge. Secondly, I am also of the view that

despite the Applicant being negligent, termination of his employment is far too

disproportionate a punishment considering the circumstances of the instant case,

thereby agreeing with the final decision of the Labour Tribunal that the Applicant

should be compensated. The above two factual observations have been expounded on

below.

A. Negligence on the part of the Applicant

For the purposes of clarity, I wish to reiterate that the charge of negligence against the

Applicant is that the Applicant had failed to properly inspect the hoarding site in

question prior to the renewal of the contract with the advertising company to extend

the same until 10th January 2015 which has allegedly caused the Respondent company

a loss of Rupees Three-hundred thousand (Rs.300,000/-). If the Applicant had in

adhering to his obligations as the Senior Manager of Promotions had gone to inspect

the hoarding site prior to the renewal, the Respondent states that he would have

observed the disturbances caused to the hoarding site in question by the overgrowth

of vegetation, and ideally should have notified the advertising company to rectify this

issue, which the Applicant had also failed to do.

The facts of the instant case indicate that the Applicant was responsible for ensuring

that the hoarding sites within Colombo were installed and maintained, including the

hoarding site in question, and further, to ensure that the said sites were visible to

passers-by without any disturbance. This has been testified by the Applicant himself

during the cross examination on 08th February 2018 (vide pg. 139 of the High Court

Brief)

In lieu of this, I draw attention to pg.4-5 of the High Court Order of the instant case

dated 31st May 2019 (vide pg.236-237 of the High Court brief), whereby the Learned

High Court Judge held as follows.

The Respondent Company needs peoples attraction. Therefore, object of

installing of hoardings is to attract more viewers. The Applicant who was the

Senior Manager (Promotions) has a duty cast on him to promote the business

of the institution, which include installing and maintaining of hoardings and

monthly inspections. When the Chairman informed him with regard to the

visibility of the hoardings what are the steps taken by the Applicant should

be consider. For this purpose, this Court has to peruse the evidence of the

Applicant and the document marked A1. Though the place was

recommended by the Chairman in 2012, 2 years later chairman informed

him that the said hoarding did not have the proper visibility at the location

where it was installed. As a Senior Manager, has he taken steps to inform the

relevant authority to ensure the proper visible condition of the hoardings.

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 21

This could have been avoided if the Applicant had visited the seen regularly

This is his main duty. Before I analyse the evidence of the Applicant, I am

mindful of this following judgment.

In Gilbert Weerasinghe Vs. People's Bank - S.C Appeal No. 81/2006 ,

Decided On:- 31st July 2008 J.A.N. De Silva.- held that

The Labour Tribunal should act in a just and equitable manner to both

parties and not award any relief on the basis of sympathy. Just and equitable

order must be fair to all parties. It never means the safeguarding of the

interest of the workman alone. Legislature has not given a free licence to a

President of a Labour Tribunal to make award as he may please.

I am in agreement with the above finding of the Learned High Court Judge. As

observed above, the Chairman had suggested a hoarding should be installed down

Maya Avenue, and it was the responsibility of the Applicant to suggest to the Chairman

of a suitable site, whether it be the hoarding site in question or another site down

Maya Avenue. The standard procedure within the Company is for the Senior Manager

of Promotions to analyse the location of the hoarding sites and to consider several

options prior to making a final decision of the most suitable hoarding site, after taking

into account the approval or disapproval of the Respondents Management. The

Respondent claims that if it had been notified of the disturbances prior to initially

entering into the contract with Regee Advertising or even at the point of renewal, it

would have given instructions to not proceed with the contract, or even if they did

proceed with the contract, to discontinue the contract, depending on the

circumstances. Furthermore, the primary charge against the Applicant in respect of the

hoarding site in question is that as the Chairman has raised the issues of visibility and

the disturbances caused by the overgrowth of vegetation, the Applicant should have

in the least attempted to rectify the issue by notifying Regee Advertising instead of

attempting to justify that there are no such disturbances. This was within his ambit of

duties as the Senior Manager of Promotions.

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 21

Therefore, in considering the first factual observation, the Applicant has been negligent

in executing his duties as the Senior Manager of Promotions. However, this does not

justify the termination of his employment as will be elaborated further under the

second factual observation.

B. Termination of employment was too disproportionate in the given

circumstances.

In framing the allegations against the Applicant, the Respondent had failed to take

note of the fact that this is an isolated act of negligence, and while it does concern

advertising which is of importance to the Respondent, it is not something which ought

to be construed as misconduct which would require termination of the employment

of the Applicant.

In the Indian case of Hind Construction & Engineering co. Ltd v Their Workmen

[1965] (1) LLJ 462 the employer used to grant a holiday on the next day where a

holiday fell on a Sunday. In this case the employer refused to grant a holiday due to

pressure of work but promised to do on a later date. Certain workmen who were

absent on the day following that Sunday in question were dismissed, and the

punishment imposed was held to be one which no reasonable employer would have

imposed. S. Egalahewa in Labour Law [Second edition (2020)] states that the courts

in fact have jurisdiction to intervene where the termination of the employment is

disproportionate to the conduct of the employee, whereby at page. 640 it reads as

follows.

Where the punishment awarded by the employer is shockingly

disproportionate in the light of the particular conduct and the workman's past

record or is such that no reasonable employer would impose in similar

circumstances, a court would be justified in drawing an inference of

victimization by the employer.

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 18 of 21

Thus, in Sri Lakshmi Saraswathi Motor Transport co. v Labour Court [1966-67] 31

FJR 54 a workman with seventeen years of service and a clean record was dismissed

as he was guilty of one day's delay in transmitting a parcel of documents from a branch

office to the head office of the employer. The workman was an office bearer of the

union. He admitted the lapse but pleaded forgetfulness in mitigation. It was held that

his dismissal was so grossly disproportionate to the offence that the tribunal was

justified in concluding that the employer had made the incident a pretext to dismiss

the workman in view of his union activities.

Further, in the Sri Lankan Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 gives a list of

misconducts in a different context. In terms of the Shop and Office Employees

(Regulations of Employment and Remuneration) Regulations 1954, under

Regulation 18, employers are authorized to deduct any fines imposed on employees

for certain acts of misconduct and these acts of misconduct are listed in the said

Regulation, which includes inter alia absence from and late attendance at work without

reasonable excuse, causing damage to, or causing the loss of goods or articles

belonging to the employer, such damage or loss being directly attributable to

negligence, wilfulness or default of the employee, Slacking or negligence at work,

Wilful failure on the part of the employee to comply with any lawful order given to him

in relation to his work. This provides an understanding of what the Sri Lankan legal

jurisdiction construes as misconduct, all the while bearing in mind that even the

aforementioned acts are not acts which warrant termination of employment. S. R. De

Silva in Law of Dismissal [The Employers Federation of Ceylon, Monograph No. 8,

Revised Edition 2004] commenting on the necessity of considering the negligence in

light of the relevant context states as follows.

It is not every act of negligence, or even one act of negligence, which would

always justify termination. The negligence must either be habitual (vide

Andhra Scientific Co. Ltd. vs. Heshagiri Rao, 1961 (2) LLJ 117), or else

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 19 of 21

sufficiently grave (vide Jupiter General Insurance Co., Lid. vs. Shroff,

(1937) 3 All ER 67).

[Emphasis added]

It must be noted that the Applicant was issued a Letter of Suspension dated 12th

January 2015, whereby several charges were levelled against him, and the Applicant

was required by letter dated 19th January 2015 to submit a Show Cause letter, which

in fact the Applicant has complied with by submitting the Letter dated 27th January

2015 (vide pg. 210-212 of the High Court brief). It must also be noted that there were

no deductions to his salary or other monetary benefits in lieu of the charges levelled

against the Applicant nor was his monthly salary discontinued during the term of

suspension from 12th January 2015 to the date of termination 12th June 2015.

At present, it is my view that the questions of whether the domestic inquiry was held

in a proper manner or what alternative action could have been taken by the

Respondent is not relevant to the instant case. The instant case is framed to determine

whether the termination of the Applicant could be justified in light of this isolated

incident of negligence, and if not, whether the Applicant could be compensated for

such a termination. For the purposes of clarity, I wish to emphasize that this Court is

not disregarding the negligent conduct of the Applicant as has been previously

established but is construing only whether the reparation of termination is too

disproportionate in the instant case.

Thus, in answering the second factual observation, I conclude that the termination of

the employment of the Applicant is unjustified on the grounds that it was

disproportionate in light of the circumstances of the instant case as it was an isolated

incident of negligence, and the Applicant could have been reprimanded in a different

way such as suspension and/deduction to his salary. It is my view that the termination

being the first course of action was unwarranted for.

Decision

In having regard to the facts and the law discussed above, I now turn to consider the

questions of law to which leave has been granted by the Supreme Court on 13th

December 2021 which have been cited above. In considering the circumstances of the

instant case, these questions cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.

In answering the first question of law, pursuant to the definition of perverse as set

out by Justice Amarasinghe in Jayasuriya vs Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation

(supra), the finding of the Labour Tribunal that the Applicant was not negligent

thereby his termination was unjustified and inequitable, would amount to being

perverse in the present context. While I agree that the Employee Applicant should be

awarded compensation as held by the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal, the

reasoning for awarding the same should have ideally been that the termination of the

employment of the Employee Applicant was disproportionate to the conduct of the

Applicant, thereby amounting to an unjustifiable and inequitable termination of

employment. Therefore, only part of the order of the Labour Tribunal would be

perverse. It must also be noted that while it has not been provided for under the first

question of law, the decision of the High Court judge not to compensate the Applicant

would amount to being perverse, and therefore, it can be said that part of the High

Court Judgement also can be construed as perverse.

In answering the second question of law, as it is only a single factual finding that the

Labour Tribunal has failed to identify, thereby making the Order only partially perverse,

an appeal should have been allowed only in relation to this single finding and not the

case in its entirety. Even having considered the entire case, the Learned High Court

Judge having identified that the Applicant to be negligent, has rectified the lapse in

the Labour Tribunal order. Thus, I accept the finding of the Learned High Court Judge

that the Applicant was negligent. However, the final decision arrived at by the High

Court not to compensate the Applicant is what would render the High Court

judgement as perverse. Therefore, while I understand that the second question of law

SC APPEAL 119/2021 JUDGEMENT Page 21 of 21

requires this Court to consider whether the High Court erred in allowing this appeal,

in the present context, the High Court did not err in allowing an appeal of the factual

finding regarding the negligence of the Applicant but has erred in dismissing the

instant case without awarding the Applicant any compensation.

In conclusion, I set aside the Judgement of the Learned High Court Judge and restore

the decision of the Labour Tribunal subject to alterations. I am in agreement with the

quantum of compensation which has been awarded by the Labour Tribunal. Therefore,

the total amount of Nine hundred and thirty-six thousand Rupees (Rs. 936,000.00) is

awarded as compensation payable to the Applicant by the Respondent within three

months of this Judgement. If money is already deposited at the Labour Tribunal, this

amount along with accrued interest, if any, is to be released to the Applicant. If not,

the total amount of Nine hundred and thirty-six thousand Rupees (Rs. 936,000.00) plus

legal interest applicable is payable to the Applicant.

Appeal Allowed subject to alterations.
