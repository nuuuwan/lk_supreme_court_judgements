"In Gilbert Weerasinghe Vs. People's Bank - S.C Appeal No. 81/2006 ,"
"Decided On:- 31st July 2008 J.A.N. De Silva.- held that"
"“The  Labour  Tribunal  should  act  in  a  just  and  equitable  manner  to  both"
"parties and not award any relief on the basis of sympathy. Just and equitable"
"order  must  be  fair  to  all  parties.  It  never  means  the  safeguarding  of  the"
"interest of the workman alone. Legislature has not given a free licence to a"
"President of a Labour Tribunal to make award as he may please.” “"
