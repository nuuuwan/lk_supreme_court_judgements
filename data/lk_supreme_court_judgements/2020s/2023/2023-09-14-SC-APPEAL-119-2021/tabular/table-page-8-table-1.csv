"a  newly  erected  one.  Not  being  convinced by  the  explanation of the  Applicant,  the"
"Respondent had issued the Petitioner with a Charge sheet, and after having conducted"
"a domestic inquiry, the employment of the Applicant was terminated."
"At the end of the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal, both parties filed their respective"
"written submissions together with marked documents. The Learned President of the"
"Labour Tribunal pronouncing the order on 16th March 2018, ordered the Respondent"
"company to pay 12-months’ salary as compensation based on the findings that the"
"Respondent  Company  had  unreasonably  terminated  the  services  of  the  Applicant."
"Among such other findings, the Labour Tribunal stated that though the Chairman of"
"the  Respondent  company  had  made  such  allegations  against  the  Applicant,  the"
"Chairman was not available as a witness before the Labour Tribunal, that the witness"
"who testified on behalf of the Respondent before the Labour Tribunal had not been"
"called to testify at the domestic inquiry, that the witness had failed to submit a report"
"with photographs thereby failing to adhere to  the standard practice followed when"
"conducting  such 
inspections,  that  as  admitted  by  the  Respondent  witness,  any"
"disturbances  caused  by  the  overgrowth  of  vegetation  could  have  been  cured  by"
"informing  the  advertising  company  as  it  was  a  matter  beyond  the  control  of  the"
"Applicant."
"The Respondent in challenging the Order made by the Labour Tribunal, preferred an"
"appeal before the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo."
"The Respondent states that the Chairman had merely suggested to the Applicant that"
"there should be a hoarding site in the area and that it was the Applicant’s duty to go"
"and 
inspect  the  site  and  determine  whether  a  hoarding  would  be  suitable 
for"
"advertising, and if so, to proceed to install such a hoarding. It thereafter had come to"
"the  attention  of  the Respondent  that the said  hoarding  was  partially  obstructed  by"
"trees  growing  from  a  private  property  and  a  light  pole,  and  the  Applicant  without"
"having  considered 
these  obstructions  and  without  notifying 
the  Chairman,  has"
"renewed the contract with Regee Advertising up until 10th January 2015."
