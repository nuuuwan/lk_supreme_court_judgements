"Justice  Amarasinghe  held  that  being  ""perverse""  in  this  context  can  have  a  broader"
"meaning than its natural meaning. His lordship held;"
"â€œ""Perverse"" is an unfortunate term, for one may suppose obstinacy in what"
"is  wrong,  and  one  thinks  of  Milton  and  how  Satan  in  the  Serpent  had"
"corrupted Eve, and of diversions to improper use, and even of subversion"
"and ruinously turning things upside down, and, generally, of wickedness."
"Yet, in my view, in the context of the principle that the Court of Appeal will"
"not interfere with a decision of a Labour Tribunal unless it is ""perverse"", it"
"means no more than that the court may intervene if it is of the view that,"
"having regard to the weight of evidence in relation to the matters in issue,"
"the tribunal has turned away arbitrarily or capriciously from what is true"
"and right and fair in dealing even handedly with the rights and interests"
"of the workman, employer and, in certain circumstances, the public. The"
"Tribunal  must  make  an  order  in  equity  and  good  conscience,  acting"
"judicially, based on legal evidence rather than on beliefs that are fanciful"
"or irrationally imagined notions or whims. Due account must be taken of"
"the  evidence  in  relation  to  the  issues  in  the  matter  before  the  Tribunal."
"Otherwise, the order of the Tribunal must be set aside as being perverse."""
