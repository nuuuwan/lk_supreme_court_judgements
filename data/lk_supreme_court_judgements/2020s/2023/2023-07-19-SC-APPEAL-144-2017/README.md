Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Walasmulla in

2005 against the 1st Defendant seeking a declaration that he is entitled

to have a six-foot wide right of way from Thalawa-Middeniya road to his

land (dominant tenement) and for an order to remove the wall erected by

the 1st Defendant obstructing the said right of way and damages. The 2nd

Defendant who is a co-owner of the dominant tenement was made a party

only for notice and no relief was sought against her. She is the sister of

the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action and compensation for harassment. After trial, the

District Court dismissed the Plaintiffs action on the basis that the right

of way the Plaintiff seeks to establish is not based on (a) any previous

Judgment (b) any deed or (c) prescription. The cross-claim of the 1st

Defendant for damages was also refused. On appeal, the High Court of

Civil Appeal set aside the Judgment of the District Court and granted the

reliefs sought by the Plaintiff except for damages. This appeal by the 1st

Defendant is against the Judgment of the High Court.

4

SC/APPEAL/144/2017

The High Court Judgment is comprehensive. The High Court analyzed

the evidence led at the trial in the correct perspective, which the District

Court failed to do. There is no necessity to repeat them here. As the High

Court has stated in the Judgment, there was clear documentary evidence

before the District Court to decide the matter in favour of the Plaintiff

although the District Court erroneously dismissed the Plaintiffs action

on the ground that there is no basis to grant relief to the Plaintiff.

If I may state the facts briefly, this right of way starts from Middeniya-

Talawa road and runs between the 1st defendants building (a business

premises on the left side) and Abeysinghe Stores on the right side. The

owner of Abeysinghe Stores is not a party to the case.

There was a previous partition case No. P/52 in the District Court of

Walasmulla to partition the dominant tenement. The Preliminary Plan of

that case was marked P4 without any objection and without subject to

proof. P4 had been prepared in 1986. In P4 this road is shown as the

access road to the land to be partitioned. The road was bounded by the

two walls of the said two buildings. There were no obstructions on the

road at that time. The Final Partition Plan prepared in 1999 was marked

P1A without any objections and without subject to proof although the

surveyor was called as a witness by the plaintiff. According to the Final

Partition Plan and the Report, Lot 1C of the Final Partition Plan, which is

six-foot wide, serves as the access road to the land; and this road had

been obstructed by the 1st Defendant of the instant case by constructing

a wall in the middle of the road (vide pages 157 and 160 of the brief). This

is the disputed road which is the subject matter of this action. The

surveyor has further stated in the Report that unless the said obstruction

is removed, there will be no access to Lots 1A and 1B of the Final Partition

Plan. The Final Decree of the partition case was marked P1 without

objection and without subject to proof. It inter alia states that Lot 1C is

5

SC/APPEAL/144/2017

declared as the access road:

, 1

, 1 1 , 1 6

, . The plaintiff has

purchased Lot 1A from the Plaintiff in the partition case by Deed marked

P3 and Lot 1B from the heirs of the 1st defendant in the partition case by

Deed marked P2.

How can then the District Judge says that there is no basis for the

Plaintiffs action? The 1st Defendant has not challenged this portion of the

partition decree in these proceedings or in the partition action itself or in

any other proceedings. In any event, the Final Decree of the partition

action cannot be interfered with in these proceedings.

According to the 1st Defendants evidence, he came to Lot A of his Plan

marked Y as a lessee in 1984. According to the Lease Agreement marked

V1, the northern boundary is the public road and the western boundary

is also a road. The 1st defendant says he purchased the leased property

in 1987. He further says that he constructed this wall in the middle of

the road in 1988. On what basis did he do so? The Plaintiff does not admit

that the wall was constructed in 1988. According to the Plaintiff, the wall

was constructed in 1999. The person who constructed the wall says that

prior to the construction of the wall, the width of the road was 6 feet (page

115 of the brief). The Defendant has no right to construct such a wall

obstructing the road which had been there even before the preliminary

survey was done in the partition action in 1986. No Plan has been

approved to construct this wall. It is an unauthorized construction.

I answer the following questions of law upon which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative.

6

SC/APPEAL/144/2017

Did the High Court err in law (a) in failing to evaluate the case presented

before it; (b) in law in holding that the Plaintiff has acquired the right of

way by prescription; (c) in failing to appreciate that the Plaintiff has failed

to discharge his burden of proof; (d) in failing to appreciate that there

should be cogent evidence to establish a claim for right of way; and (e) in

substituting its opinion in place of that of the District Court?

The appeal is dismissed with costs. The 1st defendant shall pay the costs

in all three Courts and remove the wall constructed by him in the middle

of the right of way on his own expense and clear the road within one

month of the reading out of the Judgment in the District Court.
