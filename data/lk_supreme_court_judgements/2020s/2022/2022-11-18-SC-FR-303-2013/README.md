JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC J,

The Petitioner has come before this Court alleging that the 1st to 11th Respondents

have violated the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1)

of the Constitution.

At the outset, it must be noted that the Petitioners in SC (FR) Application No.

295/2013, SC (FR) Application No. 305/2013, SC (FR) Application No.

8

332/2013, and SC (FR) Application No. 333/2013, agreed to abide by the

judgement of this application.

The Petitioner in addition to a declaration that his fundamental rights guaranteed

to him under Article 12 (1) had been violated, had also prayed for the quashing of

the letter of the 11th Respondent dated 2nd July 2013 (‘P23’) and the decision of the

Public Service Commission (1st Respondent) contained therein. The Petitioner had

further prayed for a direction to the Public Service Commission [1st Respondent]

to give effect to the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

contained in ‘P17’ and to grant the Petitioner a promotion to Class I, on a

supernumerary basis.

The Petitioner, was a public servant attached to the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service,

whose services were terminated by the State due to the Petitioner’s participation in

the general strike of July1980 [hereinafter ‘1980 July strike’].

Subsequently, all punishments imposed on the employees who participated in the

said strike were withdrawn by virtue of the Public Administration Circular No.

32/89 and the Petitioner was reinstated. In view of the fact, however, that he had

passed the relevant examinations, he had been placed in Class II Grade II of the Sri

Lanka Accountants’ Service with effect from 17th August 1992.

Thereafter, by letter [A/3/2/152] dated 27th January 1999 [P4], the Secretary to

the Public Service Commission informed the Petitioner that the Cabinet of

Ministers by a decision taken on 22nd April 1998, had antedated the Petitioner’s

appointment to Class II Grade II of the Sri Lanka Accountant’s Service to 20th May

1984 from 17th August 1992, without back wages however.

Promotion to Class II Grade I in the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service

In terms of Clause 4 (1) of the Minutes of the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 509/7 dated 7th June 1988, an Officer

confirmed in Class II Grade II, who has completed 10 years of satisfactory service

in the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service as at 27th July 1987 or on the date he becomes

eligible for promotion to Class II Grade I of the said service, may be promoted,

provided the officer has satisfied the following requirements;

9

(a) has passed or been exempted from the 1st and 2nd Efficiency Bar examination

on the due date;

(b) has passed or been exempted from the Second Language requirement.

(c) in the case of such an officer only who is appointed to the service on or after

2nd June 1986 and successfully completed the Training Course in Accountancy

conducted by the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration.

(d) has earned on the due dates all the increments during the period of five years

prior to his becoming eligible for promotion.

(e) has not been subjected to disciplinary punishment for any offence committed

during the period of five years immediately preceding the day on which he

becomes eligible for promotion;

The Petitioner had requested that in terms of the Minute referred to above, he be

promoted to Class II Grade I on the expiry of a period of ten years from the date to

which his appointment to Class II Grade II was antedated i.e., he is entitled to the

be promoted with effect from 20th May 1994.

The Public Service Commission (1st Respondent), however, refused to grant the

Petitioner the promotion to Class II Grade I on the ground that the Petitioner’s

appointment to Class II Grade II was antedated with a condition, that he would not

be paid arrears of salary and therefore his period of active service would

commence from 1992, the effective date of his reappointment. Therefore, his

satisfactory service would commence from 1992. (vide the letter dated 17th May

2002 of the Ministry of Finance marked as ‘P7’, and the letter dated 18th July 2002

of the Secretary to the Public Service Commission marked as ‘P8’).

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid decision, the Petitioner tendered an appeal to the

Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) who following an

inquiry recommended that the Petitioner be promoted to Grade II Class I of the

Accountants’ Service with effect from 20th May 1994. However, the 1st Respondent

did not comply with this recommendation.

10

The Petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 22nd June 2007.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal delivering its Order [on 18th November 2011

(‘P15’) as amended on 22nd November 2011 (‘P17’) directed the Public Service

Commission (1st Respondent) to grant the Petitioner the promotion to Class II

Grade I with effect from 20th May 1994.

Consequent to the said order of the AAT [‘P17’], the Petitioner’s promotion to Class

II Grade I was granted with effect from the said date. (P18- dated 16.02.2012)

In a further development, by a letter dated 2nd July 2013 (‘P23’) the 11th

Respondent i.e., the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance

and Planning, communicated to the Petitioner the fact that the PSC [1st Respondent]

had annulled the antedating of the promotion of the Petitioner to Class II Grade I,

which had been granted consequent to the decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal (‘P17’).

The basis set out in the above mentioned letter (‘P23’) was that the Petitioner was

appointed to Class II Grade II by virtue of a Cabinet decision on the 17.08.1992,

subject to the condition that he would not receive back wages and that, only his

period of ‘active service’ would be taken into account, when calculating the

requisite number of years of service for his promotion to Class II Grade I. As such

he was not eligible to have his promotion antedated.

The Petitioner argues that the letter marked ‘P23’ and the decision of the 1st

Respondent to annul the Petitioner’s antedated promotion to Class II Grade I is bad

in law for one or more of the following reasons;

1. The antedating of the Petitioner’s promotion was made consequent to a decision

made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that sat in appeal on the decision

made by the PSC [1st Respondent] refusing to grant the said promotion.

2. The 1st Respondent was represented in the appeal proceedings thus making the

Order made by the Tribunal on 18th October 2011 and the amended Order on

22nd November 2011, binding on the 1st Respondent Commission and its

members.

11

3. If the 1st Respondent Commission was aggrieved by the said decision the order

should have been appealed against, which course of action the 1st Respondent

Commission, however, did not pursue..

4. Since no appeal was made, the said decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal is still in force and is binding on the PSC [1st Respondent] and its

members.

The Respondents’ position

The Respondents’ position was that there were two schemes under which the 1980

July strikers were given relief. The first was, the relief granted in terms of the

Public Administration Circular 32/89 as amended by PA Circular 39/18(v) dated

10th March 1992, by which those who were deemed to have vacated their posts

were reinstated with back wages and they were given time to sit for their relevant

promotional examinations.

The second scheme was a Cabinet decision dated 22nd April 1998 by which

reappointments were back dated without back wages on the recommendations of

the Political Victimization Committee. As a result, , the Petitioner’s reappointment

on 17.08.1992 was back dated to 20.05.1984, but without back wages.

The Respondents further argue that since the Petitioner fell into the latter category

and was reinstated without back wages as opposed to others who were appointed

with back wages [ paragraph 5 of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent], his

promotion to Class II Grade I would have to be considered by only taking into

account his active period of service, and as such he was not eligible to have his

promotion antedated. Therefore, the Petitioner’s promotion to Class II Grade I

should be with effect from 17th August 2002 which is 10 years from17th August

1992, the actual date of Petitioner’s re-appointment to Class II Grade II.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondents, that the PSC [1st Respondent] had

overlooked the fact that the Petitioner had been reinstated without back wages

sequel to a Cabinet decision as opposed to, reinstatements with back wages as per

the Circular 32/89 and therefore mistakenly given effect to the Administrative

12

Appeals Tribunal’s decision which ordered the promotion of the Petitioner on the

basis of the Public Administration Circular 32/89(V). From the foregoing, it

appears that the PSC [1st Respondent] treated the two groups of strikers differently.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal [AAT] and its decision

The AAT was established under Article 59(1) of the Constitution and in terms of

Article 59(2), has the power to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision made

by the Public Service Commission.

According to Section 3 (a) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of

2002 the Tribunal has the power to hear and determine any appeal preferred to it

from any order or decision made by the Public Service Commission in the exercise

of powers under Chapter IX of the Constitution. Furthermore, Section 8 (2)

provides that a decision made by the tribunal shall be final and conclusive and

shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings in a court of law.

Commenting on Section 8 (2) of the Act, Gooneratne J. in W.J. Fernando and

Others vs. Priyanatha Perera and Others SCFR 383/2008 SC Minutes 28.02.2017

observed that;

“The preclusive clause has been included in the said Act with regard to challenging

the decision of the AAT and the legislature has done so to ensure that a decision of

the AAT must have finality. As such PSC will be bound to abide by a decision of the

AAT.” (at page 11).

It was also observed that;

“It is not incorrect to state that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is the

Appellate Body and the PSC will be bound to abide by a decision of the AAT.”

It was further held in the aforesaid case that the Public Service Commission would

have to comply with the order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the

Commission had failed to canvass the order in a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the instant case the PSC [1st Respondent] informed the Deputy Secretary to the

Treasury as well as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the reasons for the

13

reversal of the order (‘P17’) by letters dated 6th June 2013 marked as ‘R1’ and

‘R2’respectively. The PSC, however, did not canvass the AAT decision before a court

of competent jurisdiction. The Respondents, with reference to the case of W.J.

Fernando and Others vs. Priyantha Perera and Others (supra) conceded that the

1st Respondent Commission ought to have canvassed the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal (‘P17’) instead of writing to the said Tribunal

(R2). The Respondents, in their written submissions had pointed out that the

documents R1 and R2 setting out the reasons behind the PSC’s decision as to why

it cannot concur with the AAT decision, were anterior to the judgement of this

court in W.J Fernando and others (supra) which had decided the very legal issue

that had arisen in this case.

The Promotion of the Petitioner to Class I on a supernumerary basis and the

payment of arrears of salary. [ Relief sought by the Petitioner by prayer (f)]

Prior to the cancellation of the Petitioner’s antedated promotion to Class II Grade

I, the Petitioner also sought a promotion under and in terms of the Accountant’s

Service Board Circular No. 5 dated 14th March 2003, (‘P19’), which incorporates

a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers, together with arrears of salary. According

to this Circular, a Class II Grade I Officer who has completed 18 years of service

was entitled to be promoted to Class I, on a supernumerary basis. The said request,

however, was turned down by the 1st Respondent.

As per the order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal [‘P17’] the Petitioner’s

promotion to Class II Grade I must come into effect from 20th May 1994. Therefore,

the number of years of service for the purpose of calculating the 18 years required

for his promotion to Grade I, should be calculated from 20th May 1994.

Accordingly,[in terms of the aforesaid circular] the Petitioner’s promotion to Class

I on a supernumerary basis should come into effect from 20th May 2012.

Violation of the Petitioner’s fundamental right enshrined in Article 12(1)

As referred to earlier, the PSC [1st Respondent] appears to have treated, the

employees who lost their employment due to the 1980 July strike and who got their

employment back, differently, based on whether their reinstatements were with

back wages or without back wages. This resulted due to the difference of the terms

14

of the schemes under which the two groups of workers were reinstated. The fact

remains, however, that all these employees lost their employment as a result of

taking part in the 1980 July strike. Neither group had served in their posts until

they were reinstated. Thus, all these workers were similarly circumstanced and the

fact that some of them did not receive back wages cannot be considered as an

intelligible criterion to treat them differently, when it came to granting of

promotions, in particular the computation of the period of ‘active service’.

Furthermore, the Petitioner’s appointment to Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service Class

II Grade II was antedated to 20th May 1984 subject to the condition that he would

be placed on a salary point granting incremental credit for the period and that he

would not be paid back wages. This was done by virtue of the aforementioned

Cabinet decision dated 22nd April 1998 (Vide the letter dated 27th January 1999

marked ‘P4’)

The violation of Article 12 (1)

In the totality of the circumstances enumerated, it is argued on behalf of the

Petitioner that the actions of the 1st to 11th Respondents are arbitrary, capricious,

unreasonable and unfair resulting in the Petitioner being singled out for

discriminatory action which has resulted in the violation of the Petitioner’s

fundamental right to equality and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Article 12 (1) requires the law to be applied equally among similarly

circumstanced persons without any form of discrimination. However, differential

treatment is not always regarded as discrimination. Such form of treatment can be

sustained if it is reasonable and not arbitrary.

In the case of Probhudas Morarjee Rajkotia and Others v. Union of India and

Others (1966) S.C. 1044 it was observed that,

“To make out a case of denial of the equal protection a plea of differential treatment

is by itself not sufficient. The petitioner…. must make out that not only had he been

treated differently from others, but that he has been so treated from persons

15

similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis and such differential

treatment is unjustifiably made.”

When inquiring as to whether the Petitioner’s fundamental rights under Article 12

(1) have been violated the following criteria should be borne in mind;

“In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12 (1) a party

will have to satisfy the court about two things, namely (1) that he has been treated

differently from others, and (2) that he has been differently treated from persons

similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis.” (C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd

v. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and Others (1986)

1 SLR 300 at page 308).

The public servants who participated in the General Strike of July 1980 were

consequently regarded by the State as having vacated their posts. Therefore, they

constitute a group which was similarly circumstanced. It appears, however, that

they had not been reinstated together. Whilst, one group received antedated

appointments by virtue of the Public Administration Circular No. 32/89 (V) with

back wages, the other group to which the Petitioner belongs, received antedated

appointments by virtue of a Cabinet decision without back wages.

The fact of the matter is that none of the reinstated employees in fact was in active

service from the date to which their appointments were antedated. From the tenor

of the 1st Respondent’s objections, it appears that the Public Service Commission

(1st Respondent) has treated the reinstated employees who received back wages as

being in active service from the date to which their appointments were antedated

and the reinstated employees including the Petitioner who did not receive back

wages as not being in active service from the date to which their appointments

were antedated. Thus, the PSC has treated these group of employees differently

when granting of promotions came into issue. This satisfies the first limb of the

criteria referred to in the case of C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd (supra), that the

Petitioner was treated differently from others.

In view of Article 12 (1), if a group that is similarly circumstanced, is to be treated

differently, it must be on the basis of an intelligible, distinguishable and rational

criteria. When examining whether the Petitioner has been treated differently from

16

similarly circumstanced persons without a reasonable basis as per the second limb,

it must be noted that in this instance, the criteria adopted to make decisions

regarding promotions, relate to the factor of back wages. This gives rise to the

question of whether this amounts to a rational, intelligible criteria on which the

Public Service Commission should base its decisions regarding promotions.

None of the individuals who was reinstated had ‘active service’ from the date to

which their appointments were antedated. Therefore, it is unreasonable to treat as

some of them have been in active service purely on the ground that they received

back wages. It is clear that the criterion adopted by the Public Service Commission

in calculating the period of active service for the purpose of promoting the

Petitioner was arbitrary and therefore the second limb of the criteria in C.W.

Mackie and Co Ltd (supra) is satisfied.

It is also apt in this instance to highlight the fact that it is sound law that the

violation of Article 12 (1) is not restricted to positive acts of unequal treatment and

encompasses the arbitrary and mala fide exercise of power. The evolution of the

scope of Article 12 (1) was expounded in the case of Sampanthan v. Attorney

General (SC Minutes of 13th December 2018) where the Court cited Justice

Kulatunga’s commentary in “Right to Equality – National Application of Human

Rights” BALJ, Vol. VIII, Part I, page 8;

“ […] notwithstanding the Full bench in Elmore Perera’s case, the Supreme Court

has abandoned the classification theory in granting relief for infringement of right

to equality. Relief is now freely granted in respect of arbitrary, and mala fide

executive action in the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction under Article 126 of the

Constitution.” (Hon. Justice Kulatunga PC., [1999])

The Court in Sampanthan v. Attorney General (supra) also noted that Article 12

(1) “offers all person’s protection against arbitrary and mala fide exercise of

power…”.

Considering the facts of the instant case, what can be observed is that the conduct

of the 1st to 11th Respondents not only amount to discriminatory treatment but can

also be regarded as arbitrary and irrational. Therefore, it can be held the

17

Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution have been violated by the 1st to 11th Respondents.

The relief prayed for, by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner’s position is that under and by virtue of the provisions contained in

the Public Administration Circular No. 32/89 (V), he is entitled to back wages. In

terms of Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the said circular, the Petitioner would have to be

considered as having passed the examinations and interviews held during the

period he was not in service and if from the relevant date he has his seniority

restored, then arrears of salary, salary increments etc. have to be granted along

with promotions. The Respondents’ however, argue that the Petitioner is not

entitled to back wages as that is the condition subject to which his date of

appointment was antedated under the aforementioned Cabinet decision. I am of

the view that the payment of back wages claimed by the Petitioner under the Public

Administration Circular 32/89V cannot be considered, at this point by this court.

Petitioners’ promotion to Class II Grade I

The Respondents’ unwavering position is evident in the letter of the Ministry of

Finance and Planning dated 12th June 2012 (‘P20’) sent with regard to the

enforcement of the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (‘P17’). It is

stated in the letter that since the Tribunal had only ordered that the Petitioner’s

promotion be antedated and that he be entitled to incremental credit, hence the 1st

Respondent would not be able to pay back wages in accordance with that order.

In response to this letter the Petitioner by letter dated 1st July 2012 (marked as

‘P21’) submitted that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal’s order did not explicitly

rule out the payment of back wages and in order to highlight the discrimination

levelled against him, the Petitioner has given the names of five officers who had

also participated in the General strike of July 1980, and had received antedated

appointments and subsequently antedated promotions to Class II Grade I including

back wages.

The Petitioner in this case had sat for the examination for recruitment to Class II

Grade II of the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service. However, on account of his

18

participation in the July 1980 strike, he was not appointed, but those who had not

participated were given appointments with effect from 1st March 1985. By virtue

of the Public Administration letter dated 27.01.1999 [P4], Petitioner’s

reappointment to Class II Grade II of the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service was

backdated to the 20th May 1984 and the Petitioner was considered to have been

on no pay leave from 20th May 1984 to 17th August 1992, which was the day on

which he had accepted the appointment.

The Petitioner’s contention was that having completed 10 years of satisfactory

service since 20th May 1984, he was entitled to be promoted to Class II Grade I

with effect from 20th May 1994. However, the Public Service Commission’s

position was that the Petitioner’s period of no pay leave could not be taken into

consideration when recommending him for promotion to Class II Grade I in terms

of the Establishment Code and that the Petitioner would complete 10 years of

service in Class II Grade II only on 17th August 2002.

The Petitioner complained that his fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) had

been infringed by the failure to give him a promotion to Class II Grade I of the Sri

Lanka Accountant’s Service together with incremental credit and sought an order

that his 10-year period of service necessary for his promotion to Class II Grade I

be reckoned from the date to which his appointment to Class II Grade II was

antedated.

The Petitioner has also made reference to the case of J. Dharmasiri de Silva vs. The

Secretary, PSC and 11 others in SC Application No.87/2001 [SC Minutes

04.07.2001]

In the above case, the Court had rejected the claim of the Public Service

Commission that the appointment of the Petitioner in that case was prospective

and not retrospective and allowed Petitioner’s application to have his period of

service of 10 years in Class II Grade II be calculated from the day to which his

appointment was antedated and ordered for him to be granted incremental credit.

The Petitioner in the instant case argues that the order made by the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal in respect of him is similar to the order made by the Supreme

19

Court in the aforementioned case. However, unlike, the Petitioner in that case, he

has been discriminated against by being denied back wages.

For the reasons set out above, we conclude that the Petitioner had established a

violation of his fundamental right guaranteed under Article 12(1).

Accordingly, the 1st Respondent Commission is hereby directed to give effect the

decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 22.11.2011 [P17] forthwith.

The 1st Respondent is further directed to act in terms of the Accountant’s Service

Board Circular No. 5 dated 14th March 2003 [P19] and place the Petitioner on

class I on a supernumerary basis, adhering to the terms of the said Circular.
