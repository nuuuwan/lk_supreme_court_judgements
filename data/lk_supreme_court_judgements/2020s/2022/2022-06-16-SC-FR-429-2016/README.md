Argued on: 25/01/2022

Decided on: 16/06/2022

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioners to this application are presently holding the post of “Management

Assistant Non - Technological” in the Sri Lanka Tea Board (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent Board) with effect from 06/06/2012.

The Petitioners were originally recruited to the Clerical and Allied Services of the

Respondent Board. The 1st to 13th Petitioners were recruited to Grade II Segment B of

the Clerical Service while the 14th to 19th Petitioners were recruited to Grade II as

Stenographers and the 20th to 24th Petitioners were recruited to Grade I, as Data Entry

Operators.

In view of Public Administrative Circular 06/2006, a new salary structure was

introduced and the employment criteria was recategorized as per the task performed.

This was achieved through the Department Management Services Circular No. 30 dated

22/09/2006 referred to as DMS 30/06 marked ‘P5’ to the Petition. In terms of Annex II

of the said Circular, a new salary structure was introduced to the public sector in line

with State Corporations, Statutory Boards and Fully owned Government Companies.

As per the new scheme, the Petitioners were placed in the salary scale MA - 1-1-2006

(P5).

Accordingly, the Petitioners received a salary increment on the above scale to coincide

with a salary increment given to the public service (P7 and P8). On 25/10/2011, in terms

of the said DMS 30/06, a new Scheme of Recruitment and Promotions (SOR) marked

‘P9’, was introduced by the Respondent Board and accordingly, the Petitioners were

absorbed as “Management Assistant-Non-Technological - Grade I”. On 06/06/2012,

10

formal letters absorbing the Petitioners to the new Post of Management Assistant Non-

Technical, was issued.

The Petitioners contend that according to the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotions

which prevailed prior to the introduction of the new scheme (P3), a person holding the

post of Clerk had a legitimate expectation of being promoted to the post of Staff

Assistant after 5 years of service in Grade I, and to be promoted to the Executive Grade,

three years thereafter. Similarly, a person who was recruited as a Stenographer had a

legitimate expectation of reaching the post of Chief Stenographer and to be promoted

to the Executive Grade with three years of service thereafter. The Petitioners state that

in the new Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) (P9), there is no promotional path available

to the Petitioners and therefore is arbitrary, discriminatory and violates their

fundamental right of equality guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

By application dated 30/11 2016, the Petitioners, inter alia, are seeking:

1. for a declaration that the 1st to 28th Respondents have violated the fundamental rights

of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution,

2. to issue an order directing the Respondents to provide a suitable promotional post/

path for the Petitioners and

3. to issue an order directing the Respondents to promote the Petitioners to the next

promotional grade/ post provided.

This Court has granted leave to proceed for the alleged infringement of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

Application is time barred.

When this application was taken up for hearing, the learned DSG appearing for the

Respondents raised a preliminary objection that the instant application dated

30/11/2016, is time barred.

11

It is contended that the Petitioners application is filed outside the time limit prescribed

by Article 126 (2) of the Constitution which inter alia, states that an aggrieved person

may come before the Supreme Court within a period of one month from an

infringement. The Respondents contend that the said time bar is contingent upon one

or more of the following occurrences, i.e.

1. the placement of the Petitioners in the salary scale MA-1-1-2006, assigned to

Management Assistants dated 13/12/2006 (P6),

2. the introduction of the composite SOR on 25/10/2011 (P9) and/or,

3. the formal letters absorbing the Petitioners to the post of Management Assistant

Non-Technical on 06/06/2012 [P11 (a) - (w)].

Since the preliminary objection relates to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article

126 of the Constitution, I would first deal with the objection raised by the Respondents.

The Petitioners were placed in the salary scale MA-1-1-2006 assigned to Management

Assistant by Management Services Circular No. 30 dated 22/09/2006 (P5). The

application to this Court seeking a direction that the Respondents provide a promotional

post/ path to the Petitioners absorbed into the said service category, is dated 30/11/2016.

Inasmuch as the ‘lapse’ to provide a promotional path to the Petitioners is contended to

be a violation, the Petitioners do not allege that the said SOR (P9), per se, is

discriminatory. This position is further fortified by several representations made by the

Petitioners drawing attention to the said ‘lapse’ and requesting the Respondent Board

to provide an administrative remedy to overcome the situation [P16 (a), (b), (c)]. The

Respondent Board has considered the Petitioners request in their response [P17 (a), (b),

(c)].

It is observed that, at the request of the Petitioners, the then Director General of the 1st

Respondent Board made representations to the relevant authorities to seek an

administrative remedy, which continued up to the hearing of this application. In pursuit

of the said remedy, the Respondents were willing to make changes to accommodate the

12

Petitioners to create a special internal promotional path from Management Assistant to

Junior Manager, which was rejected by the Petitioners.

Continuing Violation

The Petitioners counter argument to overcome the non-compliance of Article 126 (2),

is based on continuing violation on the facts and circumstances of this case. This

Petition was not presented to Court on that basis, however, was contended for the first

time in the written submissions filed by the Petitioners.

The position of the Petitioners is that, the 1st to 3rd Respondents were contemplating the

request of the Petitioners to grant them administrative relief and therefore no particular

date is identifiable as the date when the Petitioners became aware of the omission or

failure of the Respondents. It is stated that, since there is no refusal to provide a suitable

promotional path, the violation continued, the Petitioners have also contended that the

only date that may be fixed as the date the Petitioners became aware of the infringement

is 24/06/2014 [P19 (a)], the date the HRC complaint was filed.

However, elsewhere in the Petition, it is also contended that, the Petitioners became

aware of the Human Rights Commission (HRC) recommendation dated 29/08/2016

[P19 (b)], on 31/10/2016 (P22), the date the Petitioners became aware that the said

recommendation was under consideration by the Department of Management Services.

In terms of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution, a fundamental rights application to be

filed within one month of the alleged infringement is trite law. However, there are

instances where the Court has justified exceptions to the strict applicability of one

month, when manifested in the facts and circumstances in an application (Edirisuriya

vs. Navaratnam and others, (1985) 1 SLR 100; G.S. Premachandra vs. University

Grants Commission (SC FR 573/2004); Rajakaruna vs. de Silva (1997) 2 SLR 209).

13

In Siriwardana vs. Rodrigo (1986) 1 SLR 384, this Court held that,

“An application must be filed within one month from the date of the commission of

the administrative or executive action which it is alleged constitutes the infringement

or imminent infringement of the fundamental right relied on. Where, however, a

Petitioner establishes he became aware of such infringement or imminent

infringement only on a later date, the one month will run from that date”.

By document marked ‘P22’ dated 31/10/2016, the Petitioners were informed that their

grievances were under consideration by the Department of Management Services. The

Petitioners relied on ‘P22’ to demonstrate to Court that it should exercise its jurisdiction

in the given circumstances, to grant relief on continuing violation due to the failure or

omission to provide a suitable promotional path. Accordingly, the Petitioners submit

that, even though no particular date is identifiable as the date when the omission or

failure became known to the Petitioners, the relevant date of the infringement is

31/10/2016. Therefore, there seems to be an element of uncertainty on the part of the

Petitioners to identify a date of the alleged infringement of their rights guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners position that no particular date is identifiable in the instant case, is based

on the absence or a refusal by the 1st to 3rd Respondents to provide a suitable

promotional path and therefore, it is contended to be an ongoing infringement.

In Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena (1988) 1 SLR 384, Fernando J. delivering the majority

judgment laid down three principles in regard to the operation of the time limit

prescribed by Article 126 (2), where His Lordship, inter alia, stated that,

“time begins to run only when both infringement and knowledge exists. The pursuit

of other remedies, judicial or administrative, does not prevent or interrupt the

operation of the time limit. While the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases on

the application of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault

14

or delay on the part of the Petitioner, this court has a discretion to entertain an

application made out of time”.

For sake of completeness, I also wish to make note of the dissenting judgment delivered

in Gamaethige vs. Siriwardana (supra), where Seneviratne J. opined that,

“the Petitioner in making this appeal to the Secretary, Ministry of Public

Administration---- has exercised a right granted to him by the Establishment Code

issued under Chapter IX of the Constitution ---- a fundamental right (in the

administrative sense) of appeal available to him, the determination of the period of

filling this application ---- should commence from the date of the refusal of the

appeal”.

However, in this application, the Petitioners when seeking administrative relief, as

considered in the above case, did not resort to an appeal given as of right, recognized

by law.

In Demuni Sriyani De Soyza vs. Darmasena Dissanayake (SC FR 206/2008),

Prasanna Jayawardena PC.J. upheld an objection raised by the Respondents that the

application is time barred and dismissed the application. His Lordship observed that;

“if, upon the occurrence of an infringement of his Fundamental Rights, an aggrieved

person does not file an application invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under

Article 126 (1) of the Constitution but, instead, chooses to pursue other avenues of

seeking relief, the time he spends perambulating those avenues will not, usually, be

excluded when counting the one month he has to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court

under Article 126 (1).”

The Petitioners placed much reliance in Demuni Sriyani De Soyza vs. Darmasena

Dissanayake (supra), wherein His Lordship, considering the applicable principles

when time spent by a Petitioner in making appeals or seeking other administrative or

judicial relief, stated that;

15

“An infringement can be constituted by a single, distinct and one-off act, decision,

refusal or omission. However, some other infringements can be constituted by a series

of acts, decisions, refusals or omissions which constitute over a period of time. It is

only the second type of infringement which can be correctly identified as a continuing

infringement”.

In Lake House Employees Union vs. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (SC FR

637/2009), Marsoof J. took a similar view when he observed that;

“any complain based on a continuing violation of fundamental rights may be

entertained by the Supreme Court if the party affected invokes the jurisdiction of the

Court within the mandatory period of one month from the last act from the series of

acts complained of”.

In support of their contention of infringement based on continuing violation, the

Petitioners have placed much emphasis on the refusal or omission to provide a suitable

promotional path to the Petitioners, which admittedly, continued over a considerable

period of time.

The Petitioners argument on continuing infringement rests on their pursuit of an

administrative relief, and as such, it is contended that until a decision is made by the

relevant authority, the alleged infringement is a continuing violation. In this application

the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotions itself, is not challenged by the Petitioners.

The introduction of the SOR on 25/10/2011, was followed by the issuance of formal

letters absorbing the Petitioners to the post of Management Assistant Non-Technical on

06/06/2012. Therefore, the act of issuance of formal letters absorbing the Petitioners to

the said post can be identified as a distinct act fulfilled by the Respondent Board to

absorb the Petitioners to the new post and which does not relate to any subsequent acts

or decisions made, to justify a continuing violation.

16

In Jayaweera vs. National Film Corporation (1995) 2 SLR 120, Kulatunga J. held that,

“in the circumstances, the alleged violation of rights occurred in October 1990;

pursuit of administrative remedies does not interrupt the time limit of one month”.

In the above case, having referred to Gamaethige vs. Siriwardana (supra), His

Lordship observed that,

“there was nothing to prevent the petitioners filling their applications before this

court within time and then seeking administrative relief also, if so advised”.

In this application the Petitioners are not mitigating delay nor have the Petitioners

identified a clear date which triggered the alleged infringement. As observed earlier,

the timeline is drawn by the Petitioners from the alleged delay or failure to make a

decision by the Respondents and not due to any expressed eventuality which caused a

violation. Therefore, in all the above circumstances, I think it is reasonable to pose the

question as to whether the alleged continuing violation is contended by the Petitioners

in order to circumvent the delay in coming before this Court.

In Dayaratne vs. National Savings Bank (2002) 3 SLR 116, the Petitioners challenged

the scheme of promotions and the implementation of the said scheme, inter alia,

alleging that certain respondents did not possess the actual service requirements and

that their qualifications had not been duly considered. Fernando J. upholding a

preliminary objection raised by the respondents that the challenge to the scheme was

time-barred, stated that;

“The 1st Respondent was entitled, from time to time, and in the interest of the

institution, to lay down the basis on which employees would be promoted, and that

became part of the contract of employment. The scheme of promotion published on

12.02.2001 was directly and immediately applicable to the Petitioners, and became

part of the terms and conditions of their employment. If they did not consent to those

terms and conditions, as being violative of their rights under Article 12, they should

17

have complained to this court within one month. They failed to do so. Instead, they

acquiesced in those terms and conditions by applying for promotion without any

protest”.

In the facts and circumstances of this application, the Petitioners should have become

aware that there was no suitable promotional path in the new SOR, by 06/06/2012, the

date on which the formal letters absorbing the Petitioners to the posts of Management

Assistant Non- Technical were issued. There was certainty in that decision and a clear

indication was given therein by the Respondents on the application of the SOR and the

terms and conditions of their employment in the new posts. Therefore, in this case a

clear last act in the process of appointment to the new post was taken by the Respondent

Board on the 06/06/2012, which at that time, was amenable to complain.

The Petitioners were placed in the salary scale assigned to the new post by document

dated 13/12/2006 (P6). The SOR was introduced to the 1st Respondent Board on

25/10/2011 and the formal letters absorbing the Petitioners to the post of Management

Assistant Non-Technical were issued on 06/06/2012. Therefore, at least by the

06/06/2012, the Petitioners should have become aware that the terms and conditions of

their employment is in violation of their rights under Article 12. The Petitioners were

under no attachment, want of knowledge, influence, compulsion or any other inhibition

preventing them from complaining to this Court within the said time period mandated

by law. The Petitioners have failed to provide an acceptable reason to be excused for

such failure. Accordingly, I hold that the alleged infringement does not constitute a

continuing violation as contended by the Petitioners and the time limit of one month

should commence from 06/06/2012, when the formal letters of appointment was sent

to the Petitioners. The Petitioners cannot be vindicated of their failure in not filling this

action within one month from that date.

18

Application made to the Human Rights Commission

In order to redress their grievance, the Petitioners by an application to the Human Rights

Commission (HRC) dated 24/06/2014, complained about the new Scheme of

Recruitment which they contended to be arbitrary and discriminatory. As submitted by

the learned Counsel for the State, there is no evidence placed before this Court of the

date of receipt of the said application, by the HRC.

The Petitioners complained to the HRC regarding their grievance on 24/06/2014

[P19(a)] and the Petitioners have been informed that the recommendations made by the

HRC are under consideration by the Department of Management Services (P22). The

date that is fixed by the Petitioners as the date when the Petitioners became aware of

the violation i.e, 24/06/2014, is the date on which the alleged HRC complaint was filed.

Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996

states;

“where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of Section 14, to the

Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement

of a fundamental right by executive and administrative action, the period within which

the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the Commission, shall not be taken

into account in computing the period of one month within which an application be

made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution”.

Therefore, in order to be within the statutory exception as contemplated in that section,

firstly, the complaint has to be made to the HRC within one month from the alleged

imminent infringement or infringement of a fundamental right. In the circumstances, as

contained in Section 13(1), the complaint has to be made to the HRC before the expiry

of one month from the time the Petitioner became aware of the alleged violation, i.e.

06/06/2012. The Petitioners have clearly exhausted that time limit prescribed by law.

19

Considering all the above, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents

that the application is time barred.

Application is dismissed without costs.
