Argued on: 09/07/2021

Decided on: 22/02/2022

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner is the owner and developer of the land called Walatahena, alias,

Kesbatuduwe Wellawatte and Aliyawetuna Hena, more fully described in the schedule

to the Petition. Upon the purchase of the two blocks of land, the Petitioner cleared and

created a private road from the upper block, Aliyawetuna Hena to descend to the lower

block, Walatahena alias Kesbatuduwe Wellawatte and therefrom, to the beach. The

4

Petitioner claims that the 8th Respondent has arbitrarily certified that the said road

constructed by the Petitioner within his land, as a public road belonging to the Tangalle

Pradeshiya Sabha and along with the 6th and 9th Respondents and at the behest of the

11th Respondent, facilitated the drawing of electricity lines over the said private road to

provide an electricity connection to the 11th Respondent who is forcibly occupying a

portion of the said land owned by the Petitioner, in violation of the Petitioners

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner, inter alia, also prays for an order directing the 1st to 4th and 6th and 7th

Respondents to remove all electrical lines, poles and any other apparatus and/or

equipment from the land belonging to the Petitioner described more fully in the

schedule to the Petition.

When this case came up for support, the Court was inclined to grant leave to proceed

for the alleged violation of fundamental rights enshrined in Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g)

of the Constitution by the 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents.

The facts of the case as established from the pleadings and the documents therein are

set out as follows:

The Petitioner is the Managing Director of Suduwella Resort Limited and the owner of

the two portions of land more fully described in the Petition. The Petitioner claims title

to Walatahena, alias Kesbatuduwe Wellawatte and Aliyawetuna Hena by Deed of

Transfer No. 3223 and No. 17916 and the half share of the Petitioners deceased wife,

transferred to the Petitioner by Executors Conveyance No. 6489 and No. 6488

respectively (P1 to P4).

The Petitioner contends that the 11th Respondent who was in forcible occupation of a

portion of the land named Walatahena alias Kesbatuduwe Wellawatte, voluntarily

vacated the illegal occupation upon receiving a cash settlement from the Petitioner,

however, reentered the said portion, consequent to the 26/12/2004 Tsunami, and has

5

been forcibly occupying the said potion of the land to date. The land unlawfully

occupied by the 11th Respondent is depicted in Survey Plan No. 2103/ 9000, marked

P5. The said cash settlement arrived between the Petitioner and the 11th Respondent

dated 20/05/2003, is marked P49.

The Petitioner instituted Case Bearing No. 2968/L and No. 2972/L in the District Court

of Tangalle to prevent the 11th Respondent entering the land called Aliyawetuna Hena,

for vindication of title of the land called Walatahena alias Kesbatuduwe Wellawatte and

the eviction of the 11th Respondent from the portion of the said land. Consequent to an

order obtained in Case No. 2968/L, a survey carried out by the Survey Generals

Department and the plan, super imposed on the Survey Plan No. 1301, had established

that the impugned road from Aliyawetuna Hena to Walatahena, claimed to be used by

the public is within the Petitioners land as reflected in the Surveyors Report marked

P51. After an inspection of the land, the said plan has been approved by the 8th

Respondent. In Case Bearing No. 22650, the 8th Respondent by letter dated 16/12/2016,

has informed the Magistrates Court of Tangalle, that the impugned road does not belong

to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabaha (P52). Presently, due to a court order made in Case

Bearing No. HCRA 07/2017, the Petitioner has fenced the impugned road.

It is contended that from the year 2008, the 11th Respondent who was in forcible

occupation was attempting to obtain electricity to the said portion of the land claiming

that the impugned road is a public road. The Petitioner has raised objections to such

attempts with the 6th to 8th Respondents, as more fully set out below.

By letter dated 01/12/2008 addressed to the Electrical Superintendent of Tangalle (7th

Respondent) marked P21, the Petitioner objected to any attempt made by the 11th

Respondent to obtain electricity through the Petitioners land. Thereafter, the

Petitioners lawyers and the Petitioner addressed letters dated 24/03/2010 and

05/01/2012, to the Electrical Superintendent Tangalle, marked P22 and P23

respectively, objecting to the supply of electricity to the 11th Respondent through the

6

Petitioners land. The Petitioner further states that the 11th Respondent in an attempt to

claim that the impugned road is a public road, instigated fishermen to make

representations to the Pradeshiya Sabha, when in fact, there was a public road for the

use of the fishermen. In response, the Petitioner through his lawyers sent letter dated

26/02/2009 marked P24, and informed the Grama Sevaka and the Chairman of the

Pradeshiya Sabha, that the road was constructed by the Petitioner for private use.

Survey Plan No. 2103/9000 (P29), submitted to the Pradeshiya Saba and approved after

inspection of the land on 05/04/2016, does not reflect a public road belonging to the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

A Way Leave Notice dated 07/03/2013, marked P27, received by the Petitioner from

the 6th Respondent and copied to the 8th Respondent seeking permission to draw

electricity lines through the Petitioners land to the portion of land forcibly occupied by

the 11th Respondent was objected to by the Petitioner by letter dated 22/03/2013,

marked P25. The said letter addressed to the Chairman of Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha

sought intervention to prevent the drawing of electricity lines over the Petitioners

private land. On the same day by letter dated 22/03/2013 marked P26, the Petitioner

also informed the Electrical Superintendent Tangalle, objecting to the drawing of

electricity lines over his land.

Around June 2016, the Petitioner was once again informed that the 11th Respondent

was attempting to obtain electricity to the land forcibly occupied and accordingly the

Petitioner by letter dated 16/06/2016 marked P11, addressed to the 7th Respondent,

objected to the drawing of electricity lines over his land. The Petitioner by letter dated

24/06/2014 marked P12, also informed the 5th Respondent (Public Utilities

Commission of Sri Lanka) informing the said authority that electricity lines were being

installed over the Petitioners land without his consent.

The application before this Court was necessitated by the issuance of letter marked

8R6, dated 21/06/2016, by the Secretary Pradeshiya Sabha Tangalle (8th Respondent)

7

to the Divisional Secretary Tangalle (9th Respondent) and copied to the Pradeshiya

Electrical Engineer (6th Respondent) stating that the impugned road is a public road

belonging to the Pradeshiya Sabha and the Pradeshiya Sabha has no objection to the

supply of electricity to the said road. The Petitioner claims that the said letter was

written at the behest of the 11th Respondent to facilitate the supply of electricity and not

at the request of the residents of the area to provide lighting to the impugned road as

reflected in documents marked 8R1 to 8R5. The Petitioner denies the assertion of

the 8th Respondent that the impugned road is a public road as reflected in letter dated

21/06/2016, marked 8R6. In this context it is important to note that in Case Bearing

No. 22650 in the Magistrates Court of Tangalle, filed in terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, the 8th Respondent by letter dated 16/12/2016 (P52),

submitted that the impugned road is used by the public, however, does not refer to the

said road as a road vested with the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha.

Application dated 30/05/2016, seeking electricity to the portion of land occupied

by the 11th Respondent.

It is necessary to refer to the facts in some detail since the events culminating in the

supply of electricity to the 11th Respondent, is in issue.

The 11th Respondent submitted an application to the 6th Respondent for an electricity

connection by application dated 30/05/2016 (6R1).

The D.S. 04 certification on residence and character by the Grama Niladari of the

area is dated 30/05/2016 and countersigned by an administrative Grama Niladhari

on 30/05/2016. (The D.S. 04 Certificate issued by the Grama Niladhari of the

Division in which the applicant resides is valid only for 6 months from the date

countersigned by the Divisional Secretary) (6R2).

The Petitioner by letter dated 16/06/2016 objected to the supply of electricity and

sought an inquiry (6R3).

8

By letter dated 20/06/2016, the 11th Respondent informs the 9th Respondent that he

has lodged an application to obtain electricity and electricity lines could be drawn

through the road belonging to the Pradeshiya Sabha (9R4). The date stamp on 9R4

indicates that the said document was received by the Pradeshiya Sabha on

06/06/2016.

By letter dated 21/06/2016, approval of the 9th Respondent was sought in terms of

item 3(1) to schedule I of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 as amended,

due to the objections raised by the Petitioner (9R1) (this application clearly states

that the Petitioner is objecting to the supply of electricity).

The 9th Respondent receives letter dated 21/06/2016, sent by the 8th Respondent

(copied to the 6th Respondent) informing him that the impugned road belongs to the

Pradeshiya Sabha and the Pradeshiya Sabah has no objection to the supply of

electricity to the impugned road (9R2).

The 9th Respondent by letter dated 22/06/2016, informs the 6th Respondent to

proceed with the application to obtain electricity since the Pradeshiya Sabha has no

objection to the said application (9R3).

Objections raised by the Petitioner.

Apart from the Petitioners letter dated 16/06/2016 objecting to the supply of electricity,

the Petitioner by letters dated 24/06/2016, informed the Public Utilities Commission

(5th Respondent) and the 8th Respondent that electricity lines were installed without the

consent of the Petitioner and to withhold such activity until a proper inquiry is held by

the 9th Respondent. (P12 and P13)

However, on the 25/06/2016, the 8th Respondent with the licence of the Ceylon

Electricity Board, (1st Respondent) facilitated the 6th Respondent to enter the land

owned by the Petitioner to draw electricity lines to the portion of the land occupied by

the 11th Respondent. (P14A to P14D). Moreover, the Petitioner contends that he came

9

to know that the installation of electricity lines was approved by the 6th, 8th and 9th

Respondents on the previous day.

Consequently, the Petitioner lodged a complaint with the Tangalle Police on the

25/06/2016, with reference to the unauthorized entry and the commencement of

installing electricity lines through the land belonging to the Petitioner (P15). The

Petitioner further claims that the 11th Respondent along with a few other individuals

had unlawfully entered the Petitioners land and commenced felling of trees to facilitate

the said process.

By letter dated 26/06/2016 (P17), the Petitioner informed the 4th Respondent, the

immediate superior of the 6th Respondent, outlining the circumstances mentioned above

and seeking the 4th Respondents intervention to stop drawing electricity lines over the

Petitioners land. The Petitioner states that he received no response to the said letter.

The Petitioner by letter dated 27/06/2016, (P18) again sought clarification as to how a

private road constructed by the Petitioner could be deemed as a public road vested in

the Pradeshiya Sabha, as the Petitioner had not been notified of such acquisition or

intended acquisition by the Pradeshiya Sabha or neither do any Gazette Notifications

deal with regard to an acquisition/ intended acquisition of the Petitioners land.

The position taken by the Pradeshiya Electrical Engineer, (6th Respondent) the

Secretary Pradeshiya Saba Tangalle, (8th Respondent) and the Divisional

Secretary Tangalle. (9th Respondent)

The 6th respondent in his affidavit claims that he sought approval to draw electricity

lines from the 9th Respondent on 21/06/2016 (6R4) in terms of item 3(i) to schedule I

(sic) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 31 of 2013 as amended, due to the objections

raised by the Petitioner. (P11) However, he received a copy of letter dated 21/06/2016,

(6R5) sent by the 8th Respondent and the letter dated 22/06/2016, (6R6) by the 9th

Respondent informing that the impugned road belongs to the Pradeshitya Sabha and the

Pradeshiya Sabha has no objection to the drawing of the electricity lines. In the

10

circumstances, in terms of schedule I of the said Act, approval was no longer required

from the 9th Respondent.

The 8th Respondent claims that, according to the Grama Sevaka report, (8R5) the

impugned road is used by more than 200 families (public petitions dated 16/03/2016,

16/07/2016, and 13/07/2016 marked 8R1, 8R2, and 8R3) and accordingly, letter

dated 21/06/2016 (8R6) was issued stating that the impugned road is a public road and

that he has no objection in supplying electricity to the said road.

The stand taken by of the Divisional Secretary Tangalle (9th Respondent) is that by

letter dated 21/06/2021 (9R2), the 8th Respondent informed him that the impugned road

belongs to the Tangalle Pradeshiya sabha and that the Pradeshiya Saba has no objection

for the supply of electricity and accordingly informed the 6th Respondent to take

necessary action. (9R3) He further states that when the Pradeshiya Sabha confirms and

informs the 6th respondent that the land belongs to them, there is no approval needed

from the Divisional Secretary.

The 11th Respondents claim to a part of the land claimed by the Petitioner is based on

the Survey Plan Bearing No. 6839 marked 11R1, submitted by the 11th Respondent in

Case Bearing No. 2972/L pending before the District Court of Tangalle.

Article 12(1)

Article 12(1) of the Constitution, deals with the right to equality and reads as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the

law.

In C.W. Mackie & Co Ltd vs. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue and Others (1986) 1 SLR 300, Sharvananda, C.J. commented that;

The essence of the right of equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) and the evil which the

article seeks to guard against is the avoidance of designed and intentional hostile

11

treatment or discrimination on the part of those entrusted with administering the law.

In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12(1) a party will have

to satisfy the court about two things, namely (1) that he has been treated differently

from others, and (2) that he has been differently treated from persons similarly

circumstanced without any reasonable basis.

It was further observed that .... To succeed in the plea the petitioner has to establish

discrimination in the performance of a lawful act. The doctrine of equality is intended

to advance justice according to law, by avoiding hostile discrimination. Justice is not

advanced if breach of the law is to be countenanced in the process. As stated, earlier

Article 12 does not guarantee equal violation of the law.

Subsequent to the inspection of the land belonging to the Petitioner and approval of

Survey Plan No. 2103/9000, (P29) on 05/04/2016, the 8th Respondent issued letter dated

21/06/2016, (8R6) to supply electricity through the Petitioners land on the basis, that

the impugned road is a public road belonging to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Saba.

However, the existence of a public road is not evident in the said plan. The 8th

Respondent by letter dated 16/12/2016, in Case Bearing No. 22650, informed the

learned Magistrate that the impugned road does not belong to the Pradeshiya Sabha but

a road used by the public (P52). As borne out by P53, and P54, when the land was

surveyed on 21/03/2003 and on 30/05/1998, respectively, there was no connecting road

or a footpath in existence through the land claimed by the Petitioner.

Documents marked P21, P22, P23 and P26 makes it clear that since 2008, the

11th Respondent attempted to obtain electricity through the Petitioners land. Due to

objections raised by the Petitioner a Way Leave Notice was sent by the 1st Respondent

Board (P27). The Petitioner filed a written objection to the said Notice and called for

an inquiry to be held. Thereafter no steps were taken to provide electricity to the 11th

Respondent.

12

The defining moment to the present application was when the 8th Respondent by letter

dated 21/06/2016, informed the 9th Respondent with a copy to the 6th Respondent that

the impugned road belongs to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Saba and further states that the

said letter is issued at the request of the residents of the area. (8R6) The Petitioner

contends that the said letter 8R6 was received by him only through the objections filed

by the 8th Respondent. On the very next day, (22/06/2016) the 9th Respondent informs

the 6th Respondent to proceed with the application to supply electricity since the

Pradeshiya Sabha has no objection to the said application. (6R6)

The 8th Respondent has not submitted any document to this court which justifies that

the impugned road belongs to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha.

According to the affidavit of the 6th Respondent, the Electrical Engineer has examined

the address given in the application on 04/06/2016. Due to the objections raised by the

Petitioner by letter dated 17/06/2016, the approval of the 9th Respondent was sought on

21/06/2016, in terms of item 3(1) to schedule I of Act No. 20 of 2009 as amended.

Item 3(3) to schedule I, states thus: -

(3) where paragraphs (1) or (2) applies and-

(a) the licensee has made all reasonable efforts to secure the grant of a way leave; and

(b) such efforts have been unsuccessful, the Divisional Secretary of the administrative

District in which the land, over which the way leave is being for or from which an

electrical line which is installed is requested to be removed, as the case may be,

shall within six weeks of an application being made in that behalf by the licensee

concerned, and-

(i) upon holding an inquiry after giving an opportunity to the owner or occupier of the

land concerned, of being heard;

(ii) -----

13

Having clearly known the procedure that should be followed in the event of an

unsuccessful effort to obtain necessary way leave, the 6th Respondent decided to act on

the letter issued by the 8th Respondent (6R5) on the basis that approval of the 8th

Respondent is no longer required. Having received 6R5 on 22/06/2016, on the same

date the installation of electricity lines through the impugned road was completed

within a period of 3 days during the weekend, as borne out by the Police Complaints

marked P15 and P16.

By letter dated 21/06/2016, the 9th Respondent was informed by the 8th Respondent that

the impugned road belonged to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabhawa. (9R2) By this time,

the 9th Respondent was aware that the Petitioner had objected to the granting of

electricity through the impugned road by the Petitioner and also by the 6th Respondent.

Furthermore, the Way Leave Notice dated 07/03/2013, was also copied to the 9th

Respondent informing that the impugned road is a private road. The contention of the

9th Respondent was that when the Pradeshiya Sabha states it owns the road there is no

further need to go to the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

In terms of Item 3 to Schedule I, it is mandatory that the Divisional Secretary of the

administrative district in which the land is situated hold an inquiry within 6 weeks of

an application being made to grant an opportunity to the owner or occupier of the land

concerned to be heard. Completely overlooking the said process, the 9th Respondent,

by letter dated 22/06/2016, purporting to act on the no objection letter sent by the 8th

Respondent, dispensed with the way leave inquiry and on the same day permitted the

drawing of power lines through the land claimed by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner thereafter by letter dated 27/06/2016, (P18) sought clarification from the

9th Respondent as to how a private road constructed by the Petitioner could be deemed

as a public road to which the 9th Respondent has failed to reply to date.

14

In Wijesinghe vs. Attorney General and Others (1979) 1 SLR 102

Sharvananda C.J. said a mere violation of law by the executive does not amount to a

violation of equal protection.

Following the ratio laid down in Wijesinghe vs. Attorney General (supra), it is

necessary that the court examine whether the actions of the 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents

were mere errors of judgment or intentional or purposeful discrimination of the

Petitioners personal rights.

Objections were raised by the Petitioner in 2008, when the 11th Respondent was

attempting to obtain electricity. When the Petitioner objected to the Way Leave Notice,

no further steps were taken in that regard. When a similar application was made by the

11th Respondent in the year 2016, the 6th Respondent having received objections to the

Way Leave Notice, disregarded the administrative action contemplated in terms of Item

3 to Schedule I of the Act for necessary way leave, citing a decision of the 8th

Respondent that the road to which electricity lines were to be drawn is a public road.

There is no evidence before court to justify the said decision. However, answering a

question posed by court during oral submissions as to whether the 9th Respondent was

aware at the time he received the letter that there was a dispute whether the road belongs

to the Pradeshiya Sabha, the counsel replied in the affirmative. If this issue had arisen

for the first time, such action could be expected, however, the 9th Respondent was

already aware of conflicts between the parties. If so, it was the duty of the 9th

Respondent to check and clarify issue, prior to asserting authority as reflected in 9R3.

The Supreme Court in Kaviratne and others vs. Commissioner General of

Examinations and others 2012 (BLR) 140, held that the court is not concerned with

the motivation for the impugned action, but only with its effects.

As observed earlier, the application for electricity is made on 30/05/2016, the certificate

on residence and character is issued by the Grama Niladhari on 30/05/2016,

countersigned by another grama Niladhrai (according to D.S. 4 form, should be

15

countersigned by the Divisional Secretary) is also dated 30/05/2016. The Petitioners

objections to the supply of electricity is dated 16/06/2016. The Way Leave Notice is

dated 21/06/2016 and the determination by the 8th Respondent that the impugned road

is a public road is also dated 21/06/2016. The installation of electricity lines through

the impugned road commenced on 22/06/2016 and completed within a period of 3 days

during the weekend.

Then the question to be posed is whether the denial of the Petitioners right to a fair and

an objective inquiry, prior to the process to install or to keep installed an electrical line

over the land claimed by the Petitioner violates, equal protection of the law.

Referring to the concept of equality, in Ananda Dharmadasa and others vs. Ariyaratne

Hewage and Others (2008) 2 SLR 19, the Supreme Court cited with approval the case

of Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu AIR 197, S.C. 555, where Bhagawati, J. had stated

that,

"Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be

'cribbed, cabined and confined' within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a

positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and

arbitrariness are sworn enemies."

In 2008, the 11th Respondent made a similar application to obtain electricity to the

potion of land he claims to own and possess. In that instance the Petitioner objected to

the way leave notice on the basis that the impugned road is a private road. The 8th

Respondent has pleaded a document titled, a road document applicable to the

Hambanthota District for the year 2000, marked 8R7, giving a list of the roads vested

with the Pradeshiya Sabha. The said Respondent has not specifically drawn the

attention of court to the impugned road in the said document. Accordingly, it is

absolutely clear that the 8th Respondent arbitrarily informed the 6th and 9th Respondents

that the impugned road is a public road.

16

Necessary way leave is defined in the said Act as;

Consent for the licensee to install and keep installed the electric line on, under or over

the land and to have access to the land for the purpose of inspecting, maintaining,

adjusting, repairing altering, replacing or removing the electric line;

The issuance of a way leave notice in writing would be an acknowledgement of sought,

that the road over which the electricity lines are to be drawn is not a public road. A way

leave notice is issued when the licensee has made all reasonable efforts to secure a

necessary way leave and when all such efforts have been unsuccessful. In such instance,

it is mandatory that the Divisional Secretary, within 6 weeks of such application decide

on the matter. As observed earlier, the Petitioner on his part, on various occasions, has

brought to the notice of the said Respondents that the impugned road which runs

through the Petitioners land is a private road constructed by the Petitioner. No evidence

was brought before court to establish that the Petitioners position was ever considered

by the Respondents or that the Respondents position was made known to the Petitioner.

The said Respondents cannot deny the existence of such facts and circumstances as

disclosed by the Petitioner, which would warrant an inquiry to be held according to law.

Therefore, the Petitioner has been deprived of a lawful inquiry, to any other person

similarly circumstanced in the subject matter, would be entitled to.

The decisions taken by the 8th and 9th Respondents, consequent to the decision taken by

the 6th Respondent, that the impugned road is a public road and accordingly to dispense

with the inquiry process is not justified by the evidence tendered by the 6th, 8th and 9th

Respondents. The evidence in this case clearly points to the fact that the said

Respondents were aware that the Petitioner objected to a similar application filed in the

year 2008. Therefore, clearly the Petitioners right to object to the Way Leave Notice

at an inquiry has been dispensed with, discriminating the Petitioner in the performance

of a lawful act. Discrimination may be bona fide or mala fide. If the person who alleges

discrimination succeeds in establishing that the step was taken intentionally for the

purpose of injuring him or in other words that it was a hostile act directed against him,

17

the executive act complained of must be annulled". (Elmore Perera vs. Major

Montague Jayawickrema Minister of Public Administration and Plantation

Industries and others (1985) 1 SLR 285)

When the 11th Respondent attempted to obtain electricity in the year 2008, the Petitioner

by letter dated 26/02/2009, (P24) informed the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha that

the impugned road was constructed by the Petitioner for private use. The document

purporting to claim that the impugned road is a public road belonging to the Tangalle

Pradesiya Sabawa does not state any reasons for its decision or the basis on which such

decision was made and therefore is unjustifiably made. The 8th and 9th Respondents

were aware that the Petitioner had objected to the supply of electricity, not once but

twice, in separate applications. However, the Petitioners right to an inquiry in terms of

the law was denied.

When considering this application, the Court necessarily should take note of the effort

taken by the Petitioner to initiate or be a party to multiple actions filed in court to assert

his property rights, as a result of the actions of the 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents enforcing

the law inconsistently and/or unlawfully. The 8th Respondent was possessed with

sufficient material to be well informed that the impugned road was a private road,

however, chose not to act upon. Most of the official correspondence between the 6th, 8th

and 9th Respondents, claimed to be received and sent on the same date, have no date

stamp. The lightning speed in which the process to supply electricity to the 11th

Respondent was executed, would not have been possible in the normal procedure, to

coordinate official acts and issue corresponding letters within a day, if not for collusion

between the 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents.

The manner in which the Respondents were dealing with the administration of

providing electricity to the 11th Respondent, the sole beneficiary of such act, clearly had

an adverse impact on the Petitioner. The conduct of the said Respondents as observed

in detail, in chronological order, culminating in the supply of electricity to the 11th

18

Respondent, falls nothing short of an attempt to frustrate and demoralize the Petitioner

to compel him to submit to an illegal act initiated by the 8th Respondent. In this

background the Respondents application of the law to deny the Petitioners right to a

fair, objective and an informed inquiry mandated by statute, cannot be construed as a

mistake or an error of judgment. The facts and circumstances of this case to deny the

Petitioner of an inquiry, clearly points to a deliberate design and a well calculated act

on the part of the 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents to intentionally discriminate the Petitioner,

in denial of equal protection of the law, enshrined under Article 12(1).

Article 14 (1) (g)

The Petitioners intention was to construct a high-end luxury resort in the said land with

the support of investors. However, due to the electricity lines being drawn through the

Petitioners land, it is contended that, the investors were hesitant to invest, due to the

unlawful conduct of officials to favor one party. Other than the evidence which the

court has already dealt with, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any other act

or omission, additionally to be considered as constituting an infringement under Article

14(1)(g). Therefore, I find that it is not necessary to consider whether the acts of the

said Respondents constituted an infringement of Article 14(1)(g).

Accordingly, I grant the Petitioner a declaration that his fundamental rights under

Article 12(1) has been infringed by the 6th, 8th and 9th Respondents and make order that

the Petitioner be paid a sum of Rs. 300,000/- as compensation, by each of the said

Respondents.

I make further order to quash the decision made by the 8th Respondent declaring that

the impugned road belongs to the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha, as reflected in document

8R6.

Taking into consideration all the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that an

order to remove all electricity lines poles and any other apparatus from the land claimed

19

by the Petitioner, may cause an undue disturbance and therefore, the respective parties

are directed to maintain the status quo until the 9th Respondent decide on the matter.

The application is allowed. No costs ordered.
