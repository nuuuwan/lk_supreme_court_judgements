Decided on: 07.06.2022

L.T.B Dehideniya, J.

Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner)

instituted a partition action in the District Court of Trincomalee to Partition the lot 2 of the land

called “Orr’s Hill”, described in the schedule to the Plaint amongst the Plaintiff and the 1st to

3rd Defendants-Respondents-Respondents-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Respondents). Subsequently, the 1st to 9th added Defendants-Respondents-Respondents-

Respondents (hereinafter sometime referred to as the 1st to 9th added Defendants) were added

as parties at their request and they filed their statements of claims. At the trial, a settlement was

proposed by the added Defendants to buy the portion of land they were in possession of, for

the price of Rupees 200,000/- per perch. The Petitioner led evidence and concluded the trial

marking documents P1 to P34. The other Defendants have not led any evidence. The learned

District Judge delivered the judgement accepting the Petitioner’s evidence and giving shares

as prayed for in the Plaint. The learned District Judge has considered the proposed settlement

12

and stated in his judgement that the parties have reached a settlement and the added Defendants

are willing to buy the said portion. Thereafter, the said conditions were entered in the

interlocutory decree.

The Petitioner made an application to the District Court in terms of Section 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code to set aside and/or cancel the relevant part of the judgement in relation to the

settlement, on the basis that the parties have not entered into a proper settlement. The learned

District Court judge disposed the inquiry by way of written submissions and delivered his order

dated 31.05.2010 refusing the application holding that the parties had entered into a valid

settlement.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner filed a revision and restitutio in integrum

application to the High Court of Civil Appellate in Trincomalee. After hearing the application

the learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision application by the judgement dated

14.10.2013. It is from the aforesaid judgement that this appeal is preferred.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following questions of law;

1) Is the judgement of their Lordships’ the judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

contrary to law and the materials placed before the Court?

2) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the purported

settlement is vague, uncertain and therefore cannot be implemented?

3) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the express

consent of the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants for the purported settlement were

not obtained?

4) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the parties have

not expressly agreed on specific terms and conditions necessarily required for a consent

decree?

13

5) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the nature of

the settlement was not explained to the parties before entering of the purported

settlement?

6) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the purported

settlement was made violating Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code?

7) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the purported

settlement was against the intention of the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants?

8) Have their Lordships’ the judges erred in law by failing to consider that the said order

of the learned District Judge is tantamount to gross miscarriage of justice?

The Petitioner’s Appeal is based on the ground that the judgement of the High Court of Civil

Appeal in Trincomalee, is contrary to law and against weight of the evidence led before the

Court leading to a gross miscarriage of justice.

The land in question became an effected property within the definition of the terms under the

Rehabilitation of Persons and Property and Industry Authorities Act No.29 of 1987 and vested

with the state from 1987 to 1989. On 20th December 1989, the said allotment of the land was

divested under the provisions of the said Act, free of encumbrances to the Petitioner and the 1st

to 3rd Respondents. The Petitioner and the 1st to 3rd Respondents instituted the instant partition

action in 1997. Therefore, according to the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Persons and

Properties And Industries Authority Act No.29 of 1987 it is evident that the added Defendants

cannot claim prescriptive rights to the subject matter.

It is a settled law that parties to a partition action could compromise their disputes and enter

into a settlement with the mutual consent of all the parties to the partition action.

In the cases of Caroline Perera and Another v. Martin Perera and Another [2002] 2 Sri L.R

1 and Faleel v. Argeen and Others [2004] 1 Sri L.R 48 it was held that;

14

“It is possible for the parties to a partition action to compromise their disputes provided

that the Court has investigated the title of each party and satisfied itself as to their

respective rights.”

A similar view was expressed in the case of Kumarihamy v. Weeragama et al.(1942) 43 NLR

265, where Justice de Kretser held that, an agreement which is entered into in a partition action

affecting only the rights of the parties inter se and which is expressly made subject to the Court

being satisfied that all parties entitled to interests in the land are before it and are solely entitled

to it, is binding on the parties and is not obnoxious to the Partition Ordinance.

A question with great importance before this court is whether the terms of settlement referred

to in the District Court established a valid partition settlement under the existing legal context.

According to the proceedings dated 09.09.2008, the proposed terms of settlement are as

follows;

The terms of settlement as referred in the judgement of the District Court dated 09.01.2009 are

in the following manner; (p.4)

“..What the settlement is that added Defendants indicated their consent to purchase

from the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant the Lots that they are now in possession at the

rate of Rs.200,000/- per perch. To this, the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant showed their

consent to the Court.”

Even though the law permits the parties to a partition action to compromise their disputes, the

Court has to thoroughly investigate the terms of the settlement and title of each party, before

allowing such partition settlement. According to Section 25 (1) of the Partition Law (No. 21 of

1977), learned trial Judge has a duty to examine the title of each party to the action and to hear

and receive evidence in support in order to determine all questions of law. The above legal

context has been discussed and accepted in a long line of case law. In the case of Richard and

Another v. Seibel Nona and Others [2001] 2 Sri L.R 1 it was held that it is the duty of the

Judge to fully investigate into the title to the land and shares. A similar view was expressed in

the case of Sopinona vs. Pitipanaarachchi And two others [2010] 1 Sri L.R 87 Saleem

Marsoof J. held that basic principle in all the enactments on Partition Law is that where there

has been no investigation of title, any resulting partition decree necessarily has to be set aside.

Similarly, in the case of Gangoda Mudiyanselage Wijewathi Podimenike of Mahawelegedara

17

v. Pathirennehelage Leelawathie of Mahawelgedera (SC Appeal No. 178 /2013, SC minutes

dated 14.12.2016) per Eva Wanasundera PC J., in the course of investigation of title to the land

sought to be partitioned by parties before Court, prior to deciding what share should go to

which party is more the duty of the judge than the contesting parties.

In the present application, according to the judgement dated 09.01.2009 and the order dated

31.05.2010, the Learned District Judge had investigated the title of the Petitioner and the 1st –

3rd Defendants considering the evidence led by the said parties. However, the District Judge

has not investigated the title of the Added Defendants. When the case was taken up for trial,

Added Defendants did not lead evidence and further decided not to contest the title.

Consequently, the Added Defendants entered into the purported partition settlement.

Therefore, it is evident that the Learned District Judge had no opportunity to investigate the

title of the Added Defendants for the reason that they had not led evidence.

Moreover, it is a well-established legal concept that several legal aspects need to be fulfilled in

order for a settlement to be valid before the law.

In the case of Gunawardena v. Ran Menike and Others [2002] 3 Sri L.R 243, Weerasuriya J.

(P/CA) held with approval of the case People’s Bank v. Gilbert Weerasinghe (1986) 2 CALR,

At p.244-245

..an agreement must be expressed in clear an unambiguous terms to have a binding

effect on the parties to give it the effect of amounting to an implied waiver of the right

to appeal.

Therefore, it is vital that the first instance to ascertain whether there was a settlement

by all parties who have a right to this land on clear and unambiguous terms to have a

binding effect on the parties.” [emphasis added]

18

In the present application, the subject matter is co-owned by four co-owners (Petitioner and

the 1st to 3rd Respondents) and nine added Defendants were claiming prescriptive title to several

portions of it. There has been a failure to mention the terms of the compromise, namely in what

manner and to what extent the rights of the parties are affected. Therefore, it is uncertain which

co-owner is entitled to which allotment and which co-owner is entitled to receive the payments

from which added Defendant. Further, there is no express term regarding an exact time period

to fulfil the purported settlement and no indication of consequences if one or more parties to

the settlement failed to act in accordance with the settlement.

It appears that certainty and precision, which are considered as basic attributes of a partition

settlement, cannot be found in the aforesaid settlement. Further, the learned District Court

Judge has failed to investigate the reliability of the terms of settlement, which affects the rights

of the parties. Thereupon, this settlement cannot be enforced by law and cannot be considered

as binding upon the parties.

Except for the precision of the terms of settlement, it is noteworthy that where there has been

a settlement or compromise, it must be in strict compliance with the Section 91 and 408 of the

Civil Procedure Code. Section 91 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that;

Section 91

“Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental thereto, and

not a step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by the applicant in person

or his counsel or registered attorney, and a memorandum in writing of such motion

shall be at the same time delivered to the court.” [emphasis added]

Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for the adjustment of actions and reads as

follows;

19

Section 408

“If an action be adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, or

if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole or any part of the matter of

the action, such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction shall be notified to the court

by motion made in presence of, or on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court

shall pass a decree in accordance therewith, so far as it relates to the action, and such

decree shall be final, so far as relates to so much of the subject-matter of the action as

is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.” [emphasis added]

A basic question of law to be decided is whether the purported settlement was made violating

Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code. Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code require any

settlement to be notified to the Court by way of Motion made in the presence of or on notice to

all the parties to the settlement. The above legal context has been discussed and accepted in a

range of case law.

In the case of Ukku Amma v. Paramanathan (1959) 63 NLR 306 Weerasooriya J. held that,

Section 408 provides that an agreement or compromise shall be notified to Court by motion. It

was further held that the decree entered in terms of the settlement should be vacated, where in

a purported settlement of a case was not complied with Section 408 and 91 of the Civil

Procedure Code.

In the case of Gunawardena v. Ran Menike and Others [2002] 3 Sri L.R 243 it was held that

where there has been a settlement or compromise it must be in strict compliance with the

provisions of Section 91 and Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Further, in the case of Caroline Perera and Another v. Martin Perera and Another [2002] 2

Sri L.R 1 per Justice Weerasuriya;

20

At p.4

“In Babyhamine v. Jamis (46 CLW 5) at the trial where the points in dispute were

settled among the parties before the evidence was led and the interlocutory decree

entered so as to give effect to the settlement but the compromise was lacking in

precision and did not strictly conform to section 91 and 408 of the Civil Procedure

Code it was held that in the interest of justice , the purported settlement and the

judgement should be set aside and the trail should proceed de novo upon the issues

framed.”

A similar view was expressed in the case of Avenra Gardens (Private) Limited v. Global

Project Funding AG (S.C. Appeal No. 157/2019 decided on 23.02.2022), Per Justice Janak De

" The foundation of a consent decree is the consensus ad idem of the parties. For this

reason, section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code directs that the Court should pass a

decree in accordance with the terms of the settlement. Case law emphasizes the need to

comply with this and other relevant provisions to ensure that any settlement entered is

based on the mutual consent of the parties. Any settlement or compromise must conform

strictly to the provisions of sections 91 and 408 of the Civil Procedure Code. If the

compromise was lacking in precision and did not strictly conform to sections 91 and

408 of the Civil Procedure Code and it leads to confusion and uncertainty, any decree

entered on it could be attacked on the ground of want of mutuality [Faleel v. Argeen

and Others (2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 48]. Thus, in Dassanaike v. Dassanaike (30 N.L.R. 385

at 387), Fisher, C. J. observed: “It is fundamentally necessary before section 408 can

be applied that it should be clearly established that what is put forward as an agreement

21

or compromise of an action by the parties was intended by them to be such.” [emphasis

added]

At p. 7-8

“..It directs that “such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction shall be notified to the

court by motion…”. In my view, these words require the terms of the settlement to be

incorporated into a motion signed by the registered attorney for all parties to the

settlement. There can be no room for any dispute once terms are recorded in a motion

and the parties concerned have indicated their consent by the registered attorney-at-

law signing the motion containing the terms of the settlement.” [emphasis added]

Nevertheless, when carefully considering the present Application, it appears that the terms of

settlement have not been produced by way of a motion as required by law. Instead, the terms

were recorded in open court on 09.09.2008. Further, according to the proceedings of the

District Court dated 09.09.2008 and 18.11.2008, some of the added Defendants were absent

and some of them were deceased at the time when the terms of settlement were recorded in the

open court. Therefore, it is evident that the learned District Judge has failed to consider the

following legal factors, when entering the Partition Decree:

i. Terms of settlement was not incorporated into a motion as required by law.

ii. Terms of settlement was recorded in the open court without the mutual consent

of all the parties to the case.

iii. Terms of Settlement was lacking in precision and did not strictly conform to

sections 91 and 408 of the Civil Procedure Code and it leads to confusion and

uncertainty.

It is a trite law that, settlement of a partition action between the parties is welcome. The

settlement between parties should be allowed by the Court to the extent possible in the law. On

that account, in my view, pursuant to evidence and case law discussed, there is a significant

absence of precision and certainty in the terms of settlement in this case. Moreover, it is

apparent that the purported settlement was made violating Sections 91 and 408 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Therefore, in the eyes of law, the purported terms of settlement in the present

application is invalid and cannot be enforced before law.

I answer the questions of law as follows;

1) Yes

2) Yes

3) Yes

4) Yes

5) Yes

6) Yes

7) Yes

8) Yes

Under these circumstances, the settlement is invalid and should be set aside.

The Petitioner has also prayed for the cancellation of the settlement, contesting that the said

settlement has been commissioned violating the provisions of law. When looking at the

proceedings of the District Court, it appears that the added Defendants did not lead evidence,

relying on the proposed settlement.

Therefore, I set aside the District Court judgement dated 09.01.2009 and the interlocutory

decree entered upon the said judgement and direct the learned District Court judge of the

23

District Court of Trincomalee to proceed with the trial from the point where the Petitioner

closed the case after leading evidence. I allow the Appeal, set aside the order dated 31.05.2010

of the District Court of Trincomalee, set aside the interlocutory decree, set aside the judgment

dated 14.10.2013 of the Civil Appellate High Court of Trincomalee, and set aside the

settlement.
