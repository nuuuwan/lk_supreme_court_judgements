This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 15.02.2017. The crux of this matter centers around the question of law based on which leave to appeal was granted, which is; \u201cDid the Court of Appeal err by dismissing the case filed by the Petitioner before the District Court as regard to the Substituted 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent whereas he had not appealed against the judgment of the learned District Judge to the Court of Appeal?\u201d Therefore, this discussion hinges on whether a party to an action should be allowed to lawfully invoke an objection to, or dispute a finding in, a lower court\u2019s judgment even if the said party had not filed an appeal against the said judgment of the lower court. The facts of the case are stated briefly as follows: The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was, by letter dated 27.06.1991 (marked P3), appointed as the Executive Director of the Board of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd Respondent). Thereafter, the Appellant was also appointed as the General Manager of the 3rd Respondent Company by letter dated 29.06.1991 (marked P4). The original 1st and 2nd Defendants who were respectively the Secretary and Deputy Secretary to the Treasury had, in their capacity as holders of 50% of share capital of the 3rd Respondent Company, removed the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant and three others from the Directorate of the 3rd Respondent and appointed 4 others as Directors. The Appellant filed action in the District Court of Colombo against the original Defendants praying inter alia for a declaration that the removal of the Appellant as a director",

The original Defendants jointly filed their Answer to dismiss the Appellant\u2019s action stating that the removal of the Appellant from his position was lawful and in accordance with the terms of Article 10 of the Articles of Association of the 3rd Respondent Company. The Learned District Judge delivered judgment on the 12th of July 1999 in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant granting him Rs. 200,000/- in damages payable by the 1st-3rd Defendants jointly or severally. The original 1st and 2nd Defendants then preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, the 3rd Defendant refrained from appealing to the Court of Appeal. During the pendency of the application before the Court of Appeal, the original 3rd Defendant, Seemasahitha Wennappuwa Janatha Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya, was substituted by the Sri Lanka Transport Board established under the Sri Lanka Transport Board Act No. 27 of 2005. By virtue of section 3 (2) (e) of the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies Act, No. 23 of 1987, all actions and proceedings instituted by or against the amalgamated bus companies, of which the 3rd Defendant company was one, were vested with the Sri Lanka Transport Board, thus enabling the Board to be substituted as the 3rd Defendant-Respondent. The Court of Appeal delivered judgment on the 15th February 2017 allowing the Appeal and dismissing the action filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant in the District Court. The Court held that the Learned Trial Judge had misapplied Article 10 of the Articles of Association and that the termination of the Appellant\u2019s services was not illegal, null and void. Moreover, the granting of compensation to the Appellant was held to be unsubstantiated and bad in law. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant filed a Special Leave to Appeal application to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while granting leave, rejected the legal issues stated in the Petition of Appeal and discharged the 1B and 2A Defendant-Appellant-Respondents from the proceedings, on the basis that the Appellant did not pursue any relief against them. As Leave to Appeal was not granted on the merits of the Appellant\u2019s action, such merits will not be extensively delved into by me at this instance.",

    "text": "Rather, my analysis will be confined to examining the aforesaid question of law based on which leave was granted. In this respect, the question arisen before this Court is whether the Court of Appeal could dismiss the judgment of the District Court granted against the predecessor of the Substituted 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent, even though the aggrieved Substituted 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent had not filed an appeal against such judgment. As this issue rests at the root of this case, the principles of law relating to this contention will be considered by me hereafter. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant in his submissions observed that the 3rd Respondent Company had refrained from appealing against the District Court judgment. It was further contended that neither has it filed a \u2018written objection\u2019 under Section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code conveying its intent to object to the judgment. Thus, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the 3rd Respondent had accepted the judgment of the District Court and is thus not entitled to the relief granted by the Court of Appeal which was allegedly not prayed for by him at the said instance. Section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for written objections or \u2018cross objections\u2019 to be filed as follows;",

The Court of Appeal has inherent jurisdiction to grant or refuse such permission in the interest of justice.\u201d Therefore, it is now settled law that, even though a Respondent who has not duly filed a written objection cannot claim the right to object to a decree as an entitlement, an Appellate Court has the discretion, by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction, to permit such objection in the interests of justice. The next point of contention is whether the scope of the application of written objections under section 772 allows for such objections to be brought by a Respondent against another Respondent\u2013 and not merely against an Appellant. The general rule postulated states that any such objection can be invoked by a Respondent only against an Appellant. Accordingly, a Respondent to an appeal cannot, for the most part, challenge a finding in the judgment or decree granted in favour of another Respondent.

I will firstly consider the second type of exceptional circumstance iterated in the above decision- that is, whether the interests of the Appellant and the interests of the Respondent against whom a written objection under section 772 is filed, are identical or substantially similar. In the case of (Mirza) Husain Yar Beg v. (Sahu) Radha Kishan And Ors.

    "text": "co-respondent also if there is a community of interest between the latter and the appellant. It is clear to us that where the cross-objection is directed solely against a co-respondent, whose case has nothing in common with that of the appellant but proceeds on the same grounds on which the appeal does, it is not maintainable.\u201d In a similar manner, when this case was before the Court of Appeal, the Court dismissed the action filed by the Plaintiff- Respondent Director (who is now the Appellant) in the District Court questioning the termination of his services as regard to the Substituted 3rd Defendant- Respondent who was the Sri Lanka Transport Board. However, the objections taken up by the 3rd Defendant- Respondent Company were directed solely at the Plaintiff- Respondent Director and not to any extent against the 1st and 2nd Defendant-Appellants, who were respectively the Secretary and Deputy Secretary to the Treasury. Accordingly, the Plaintiff-Respondent Director\u2019s case has nothing in common with that of the Defendant-Appellants, who assert the legality of his termination. Thus, as their interests cannot be considered similar, the second type of exceptional circumstance enumerated above cannot be said to exist. I will now consider the first type of exceptional circumstance set out above, that is, whether the determination of the relief sought by the Appellant will necessarily require the Appellate Court to examine the lawfulness of the reliefs granted in the decree inter se the Respondents. The 1st and 2nd Defendant-Appellants, in preferring an Appeal to the Court of Appeal had prayed to set aside the verdict of the Learned District Judge holding in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent Director. The central contention of the said Defendant-Appellants in the Court of Appeal was that the Learned Trial Judge had misinterpreted Article 10 of the Articles of Association of the 3rd Respondent Company in holding that the Plaintiff\u2019s termination was illegal. Therefore, at this point it is necessary to ascertain whether the nature of the said relief sought by the Defendant-Appellants was such that it became necessary for Court to examine the lawfulness of the relief granted by the lower Court. The Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal in delivering judgment had identified the relief sought by the respective parties, and had analyzed the provisions of Article 10 and its implications, in holding that the removal of the Plaintiff-Respondent from his Directorship was not illegal, thus allowing the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court had also scrutinized judicial decisions including the judgment of S. N. Silva, J. in Mendis v. Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha Santhaka",

    "text": "Pravahana Sevaya and Others ([1995] (2) Sri LR 284) which held that the appointment and removal of Directors of a company are comprehensively regulated by its Articles of Association. Therefore, I am of the opinion that due to the nature of the relief sought by the Defendant-Appellants, it has been necessarily required for the Court of Appeal to examine the lawfulness of the reliefs granted by the District Court in the Plaintiff-Respondent\u2019s favour. Accordingly, I hold that there were exceptional circumstances in this case which justify the cross-objections directed by the Substituted 3rd Defendant- Respondent- Respondent towards his co-respondent, who in this case is the Plaintiff- Respondent- Appellant. In conclusion, based on the principles of law pronounced in Section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code and those of notable judicial decisions in Sri Lanka as well as India, it is now evident that the Substituted 3rd Defendant- Respondent- Respondent Company may lawfully invoke an objection as against the Plaintiff- Respondent- Appellant, even if it has not appealed against the lower Court\u2019s judgment. In view of the above findings, I hold that the question of law raised by the Supreme Court at the onset in determining the granting of leave to this application should be answered in the negative, and in favour of the Respondent. Therefore, I see no necessity in interfering with the decision of the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal in dismissing the case filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant before the District Court. The appeal would accordingly stand dismissed.",
