Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kegalle

seeking a declaration that he is the owner of the immovable

property described in the schedule to the plaint by deed No. 6165

marked P2, ejectment of the defendant therefrom and damages.

The defendant, who was the transferor of the property by deed P2

to the plaintiff, filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiff’s

action and a declaration that the plaintiff is holding the property

by deed P2 in trust for the defendant. In the alternative, the

defendant prayed that deed P2 be set aside on the ground of laesio

enormis. After trial, the District Court entered judgment for the

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 4

plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the said judgment.

Hence this appeal by the defendant to this Court.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the question of law whether

the District Court and the High Court erred in deciding that there

was no evidence to prove that the defendant did not intend to part

with the beneficial interest in the property when deed P2 was

executed. On behalf of the plaintiff, a purported consequential

question of law was raised to say that the defendant cannot raise

trust and laesio enormis in the same action. In my view, the latter

cannot be a consequential question since this Court did not grant

leave to appeal to the defendant on the question of laesio enormis.

Constructive trust

The only question for decision in this appeal is whether deed P2

is an outright transfer or a transfer effected subject to a

constructive trust.

A constructive trust is largely an equitable remedy for the benefit

of the rightful owner of the property against the person holding

the legal right to the property in an inequitable and

unconscionable manner. Unlike in an express trust, in the case

of a constructive trust, the intention of the parties is not apparent.

Section 3(p) of the Trusts Ordinance, No. 9 of 1917 defining

express trust states “express trust means a trust that is created by

the author of the trust generally in the form of an instrument in

writing with certainty indicating the intention of the trust, but does

not include a constructive trust or a de facto trust, whether

charitable or not”.

Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance (sections 82-98) deals with

categories of constructive trusts. What is relevant in the instant

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 5

case is the category described under section 83 of the Trusts

Ordinance, which runs as follows:

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it

cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the

attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of the

beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must

hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative.

If it can be inferred by Court, as stated in section 83, from “the

attendant circumstances” (the circumstances which precede or

follow the transfer) that the owner did not intend to dispose of the

beneficial interest in the property when he transferred the legal

interest to the transferee, an obligation in the nature of a

constructive trust is considered to have been created. However,

there is no general principle to determine “the attendant

circumstances” on which a constructive trust can be held to have

been established. Whether or not a constructive trust has been

created is a question of fact. As the term “constructive trust”

denotes, the Court construes that the defendant should be treated

as the trustee of the property. In Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Herbert

Smith (No 2) [1969] 2 Ch 276 (CA), Edmund-Davies L.J. stated

“English Law provides no clear and all-embracing definition of a

constructive trust. Its boundaries have been left perhaps

deliberately vague so as not to restrict the court by technicalities in

deciding what the justice of a particular case might demand.” The

onus of proof of a constructive trust is on the person who claims

such a trust. The test is objective as opposed to subjective (De

Silva v. Silva (1956) 58 NLR 145, Wijeyaratne v. Somawathie

[2002] 1 Sri LR 93).

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 6

As held in the case of Piyasena v. Don Vansue [1997] 2 Sri LR 311:

The trust is an obligation imposed by law on those who try

to camouflage the actual nature of the transaction. When the

attendant circumstances point to a loan transaction and not

a genuine sale transaction the provisions of section 83 of the

Trust Ordinance apply.

Section 96 quoted below, which falls within Chapter IX of the

Trusts Ordinance, is a residuary section without limitation

(Seelachchi v. Visuvanathan (1922) 23 NLR 97).

In any case not coming within the scope of any of the

preceding sections where there is no trust, but the person

having possession of property has not the whole beneficial

interest therein, he must hold the property for the benefit of

the persons having such interest, or the residue thereof (as

the case may be), to the extent necessary to satisfy their just

demands.

Acceptance of parol evidence notwithstanding section 2 of

the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and sections 91 and 92

of the Evidence Ordinance

Section 5(1) of the Trusts Ordinance requires that a declaration

of trust of immovable property shall be notarially executed:

Subject to the provisions of section 107, no trust in relation

to immovable property is valid unless declared by the last

will of the author of the trust or of the trustee, or by a non-

testamentary instrument in writing signed by the author of

the trust or the trustee, and notarially executed.

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 7

In addition, section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, No.

7 of 1840, and sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, No.

14 of 1895, mandate that transactions in relation to immovable

property be notarially executed and that no oral evidence is

permitted to be led to contradict such documents.

Despite the above express provisions, parol evidence is

nevertheless admitted to establish a constructive trust. This is

justified on different grounds.

The Trusts Ordinance was enacted subsequent to the Prevention

of Frauds Ordinance and the Evidence Ordinance and therefore

in the event of a conflict, the later Act should prevail. Maxwell on

The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition, page 193 states “If,

however, the provisions of a later enactment are so inconsistent

with or repugnant to the provisions of an earlier one that the two

cannot stand together, the earlier is abrogated by the later.”

In Bernedette Vanlangenberg v. Hapuarachchige Anthony [1990] 1

Sri LR 190 at 202, the Supreme Court took the view that section

2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance is applicable only to the

trusts created under Chapter II of the Trusts Ordinance and not

to the constructive trusts created under Chapter IX of the Trusts

Ordinance.

It is also significant to note that although section 5(1) of the Trusts

Ordinance enacts that no trust in relation to immovable property

is valid unless notarially executed, section 5(3) further provides

“These rules do not apply where they would operate so as to

effectuate a fraud.” (Ehiya Lebbe v. Majeed (1947) 48 NLR 357)

This means where fraud is alleged, the formalities are not insisted

upon; even an oral agreement is sufficient.

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 8

In the Privy Council case of Valliyammai Atchi v. Abdul Majeed

(1947) 48 NLR 289 it was held:

The formalities required to constitute a valid trust relating to

land are to be found in section 5 of the Trusts Ordinance and

not in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance; that

the act of the widow in seeking to ignore the trust and to

retain the property for the estate was to effectuate a fraud;

that, therefore, under section 5(3) of the Trusts Ordinance

even a writing was unnecessary and sections 91 and 92 of

the Evidence Ordinance had no application.

The applicability of section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance, which enacts that instruments affecting immovable

property shall be of no force or avail in law unless notarially

attested, has to be relaxed in the case of constructive trusts, as

the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance designed to prevent fraud

cannot be allowed to be misused to cover fraud. In some cases of

constructive trusts, there is a non-notarial document executed in

parallel to the notarially executed one manifesting the true

intention of the parties. Such informal writings can be led in

evidence notwithstanding section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance and sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance

(Dissanayakage Malini v. Mohomed Sabur [1999] 2 Sri LR 4).

In terms of the first proviso to section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance quoted below, sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance would not apply if parol evidence is to be led to

invalidate an instrument on fraud, mistake etc:

Any fact may be proved which would invalidate any

document, or which would entitle any person to any decree

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 9

or order relating thereto, such as fraud, intimidation,

illegality, want of due execution, want of capacity in any

contracting party, the fact that it is wrongly dated, want or

failure of consideration, or mistake in fact or law.

The fact that a notarially executed written document is not an

indispensable requirement to create a trust is also discernible by

section 107 of the Trusts Ordinance, which recognises “De facto

trusts”. It reads as follows:

In dealing with any property alleged to be subject to a

charitable trust, the court shall not be debarred from

exercising any of its powers by the absence of evidence of

the formal constitution of the trust, if it shall be of opinion

from all the circumstances of the case that a trust in fact

exists, or ought to be deemed to exist.

Attendant circumstances in favour of a constructive trust

I take the view that the learned District Judge has failed to

evaluate the evidence in the proper perspective.

A proper analysis of the evidence led before the District Court

demonstrates that the real reason for the execution of deed P2

was to secure a loan from the plaintiff and there was no intention

to effect an outright transfer of the property. Let me now justify

this finding.

The property in suit is the residential property of the defendant.

The defendant had mortgaged the property to the Rural Bank to

obtain a loan of Rs. 75,000 on 06.02.1997 at an interest rate of

30% per annum. The plaintiff himself produced this Mortgage

Bond marked P4. According to the defendant, she obtained a loan

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 10

of Rs. 100,000 from the plaintiff to be repaid with interest at a

rate of 20% per annum to redeem the said mortgage offering this

property as security, although the impugned deed P2 is prima

facie an outright transfer. This contention is acceptable, as deed

P2 was executed and the mortgage to the Rural Bank was

admittedly redeemed on the same day, i.e. 07.03.2000.

There is no dispute that the consideration passed on deed P2 is

Rs. 100,000. If deed P2 was a genuine sale, as the plaintiff claims,

the defendant would have had to pay more than the selling price

of the property to the Rural Bank to redeem the mortgage (Rs.

75,000 with 30% interest from 06.02.1997 to 07.03.2000)! If that

were the reality, the defendant could have simply stayed away and

allowed the Rural Bank to sell the property to recover its dues.

This in itself demonstrates that the defendant by executing P2

intended not to part with the property but to continue to possess

the property.

The plaintiff has admitted in evidence that he lends money to

others; he is a money lender. The transfer deeds marked D5 of

2005 and D6 of 2001 bear testimony to this. Although they are

prima facie outright transfers in favour of the plaintiff in relation

to different lands by different people, the plaintiff himself in re-

examination admitted that deeds D5 and D6 are securities taken

by him for loans.

It is significant to note that in deed D5, the attesting witnesses

are Somaratne and Piyasena; in deed D6, the attesting witnesses

are Somaratne and Herath Banda. In the impugned deed P2, the

attesting witnesses are Herath Banda and the plaintiff’s wife. In

P5, which I will refer to later, the first witness is Somaratne. Apart

from the plaintiff’s own evidence, the only witnesses called by him

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 11

to substantiate his case are Somaratne and Herath Banda. This

indicates that they work as a team lending money at high interest

rates and retaining immovable properties as securities.

According to the plaintiff’s evidence, he does not know the exact

boundaries of the land and the layout of the house standing on it

where the defendant lives.

The plaintiff has admitted in evidence that he does not have the

title deed of the defendant although he purchased the property by

P2. The title deed is still with the defendant. In a genuine sale

transaction, in the ordinary course of events, the old deeds of the

seller are given to the purchaser.

Even after this transaction, up to now, the defendant has

continued to live on the property with her family. The

continuation of possession of the property even after the alleged

transfer is a well-known “attendant circumstance” in favour of a

trust.

The document strongly relied upon by the learned District Judge

to hold against the defendant on this point is the existence of P5

whereby the defendant, whilst accepting that she sold the

property to the plaintiff, has promised to leave the premises within

three months from the date of that document, i.e. from

22.06.2002. The parties are at variance on the circumstances in

which P5 was given by the defendant. Be that as it may, it is

relevant to note that P5 was obtained by the plaintiff not on the

same day on which deed P2 was executed but more than two years

after the execution of P2: P2 is dated 07.03.2000 and P5 is dated

22.06.2002. P6 is a similar letter issued by the defendant to the

Ceylon Electricity Board permitting the monthly electricity bills to

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 12

be changed in the name of the plaintiff. By D3, which is referred

to in the next paragraph, the defendant promised to get the land

released within two years of the execution of deed P2. P5, written

two years after P2, is, in my view, consistent with the defendant’s

version that P2 was not an outright transfer.

Another strong “attendant circumstance” in favour of a trust is

the informal agreement marked D3 through the plaintiff.

According to the defendant, this non-notarial document was

signed contemporaneously with deed P2. It bears the same date

as that of deed P2. The plaintiff identifies his wife’s signature on

D3. By this document the defendant, whilst stating that she sold

the property to the plaintiff by P2, further states that she

undertakes to get the land released by paying Rs. 100,000 with

20% interest per annum within two years. (“එකී රුපියල් ලක්ෂයේ මුදල හා

ය ාලිය (20%) යෙවා ඉඩම නිදහස් කර ෙන්නා බවටත්, කෑෙල්ල යේවායල්ෙම, පුස්සැල්ල දිංචි

ක්ලරැයින් යහ්වා අයේවික්‍රම වන මම යමයින් ය ායරාන්ු යවමි.”) The signatories to D3

are the defendant and the two attesting witnesses to deed P2, one

of whom is the plaintiff’s wife. It is clear that if the defendant by

P2 transferred both her legal and beneficial interest in the land,

D3 is meaningless. D3, in my view, illustrates that P2 is not an

out and out transfer.

The argument advanced by learned President’s Counsel for the

plaintiff that at the most D3 is a contract to repurchase the

property by the defendant, in which class of contract time is of

the essence, and the defendant failed to pay the money to

retransfer the property within two years of the execution of deed

P2 and therefore the plaintiff’s action shall fail, is unacceptable.

Such a conclusion could be arrived at only on the footing that the

defendant transferred both her legal and beneficial interest in the

property by deed P2 (Dayawathie v. Gunasekera [1991] 1 Sri LR

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 13

115 at 120-121). L.J.M. Cooray in his masterpiece The Reception

in Ceylon of the English Trust at page 129, whilst stating that an

agreement to reconvey could come within section 96 of the Trusts

Ordinance (residuary section in Chapter IX which deals with

constructive trusts), further explains at 129-130:

If there is a trust, the contractual rule that time is of the

essence of the contract would not be relevant and it would

be unnecessary to insist that the purchase money should be

tendered within the specified period. If this is so, a trust

under section 83 will also arise where a person has

transferred property subject to a notarial agreement to

reconvey within a specified period, and he cannot enforce the

agreement because the period has elapsed. But if within a

reasonable period the purchase price has not been repaid it

may be assumed that the transferor has no intention of

exercising the right of repurchase and has therefore parted

with the beneficial interest.

The inadequate consideration on the face of the deed and the

actual value of the property is another “attendant circumstance”

which favours the view that the beneficial interest has not been

parted with.

Different interpretations have been given by the parties to the

document marked D8. By D8 dated 25.02.2002 (which date falls

within the period of two years from the execution of deed P2), the

defendant agreed to sell the property to the plaintiff’s daughter for

a sum of Rs. 500,000 having already collected Rs. 100,000 from

the plaintiff. This indicates that the value of the property was

much higher than Rs. 100,000 at the time of the execution of deed

P2. If the defendant wanted to part with both the legal and

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 14

beneficial interest in the land at the time of the execution of deed

P2, she would not have sold the land for a sum of Rs. 100,000.

There is no evidence that the defendant was looking for buyers to

sell this land or that the land price increased by four times the

value within two years.

In the Supreme Court case of Premawathi v. Gnanawathi [1994] 2

Sri LR 171 the following facts were established through evidence:

(a) The defendant was in urgent need of money at the time she

sold her land to the plaintiff on P1 for a sum of Rs. 6,000.

(b) The plaintiff by a non-notarial document agreed to

retransfer the land to the defendant upon payment of the

said sum of Rs. 6,000 within a period of 6 months and

although the defendant tendered the money to the plaintiff

within that period the retransfer could not be effected

because the plaintiff was in hospital.

(c) Although the consideration on P1 was Rs. 6,000 the

plaintiff admitted that the value of the land was about Rs.

15,000.

(d) The plaintiff's evidence was that she was ready and willing

to re-transfer the land to the defendant within the period of

6 months. This was considered to be indicative of the fact

that the plaintiff realised that there was an obligation

attached to her ownership of the land.

(e) The possession of the land remained with the defendant.

On the said findings of fact, G.P.S. de Silva C.J. at page 175

concluded:

In my view, the above facts and circumstances point to a

“constructive trust” within the meaning of section 83 of the

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 15

Trusts Ordinance. In other words, “the attendant

circumstances” show that the 1st defendant did not intend

“to dispose of the beneficial interest” in the land by P1.

In the Supreme Court case of Dayawathie v. Gunasekera [1991] 1

Sri LR 115, the following “attendant circumstances” were

considered sufficient to demonstrate that the original plaintiff

(transferor) hardly intended to dispose of his beneficial interest in

the property:

(a) The oral promise to reconvey the property in suit on receipt

of Rs. 17,000 comprising the money advanced and the

interest thereon.

(b) The original plaintiff continuing to remain in possession of

the property.

(c) The original plaintiff's agreement to pay all future

instalments due on account of the loan obtained from the

National Housing Department.

(d) The gross disparity between the consideration on the face

of the deed (Rs. 17,000) and the market value of the

property (Rs. 70,000-80,000)

(e) The first defendant’s failure to take steps to assert her

ownership pursuant to the purchase until she received the

letter of demand, namely, the failure to get her name

registered as the owner in the assessment register of the

local authority and non-payment of instalments payable to

the National Housing Department.

(f) The original plaintiff taking steps to obtain a loan from the

State Mortgage Bank soon after the transaction to pay off

debts due to the defendants and to the National Housing

Department.

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 16

Similarly, continued possession after the alleged transfer by the

transferor; inadequate purchase price; failure to cause

examination of the title of the property prior to the purchase;

failure to produce the old deeds were considered in Carthelis v.

Ranasinghe [2002] 2 Sri LR 359 to be circumstances in favour of

a constructive trust.

(vide also Wijeytilaka v. Ranasinghe (1931) 32 NLR 306, Ehiya

Lebbe v. Majeed (1947) 48 NLR 357, Thisa Nona v. Premadasa

[1997] 1 Sri LR 169, Perera v. Fernando [2011] 2 Sri LR 192)

Conclusion

The attendant circumstances in the instant case do not show that

the defendant intended to dispose of the beneficial interest in the

property to the plaintiff by deed P2 and that the plaintiff is a bona

fide purchaser of the property. Hence it can be concluded that the

plaintiff is holding the property for the benefit of the defendant,

creating a constructive trust within the meaning of section 83 of

the Trusts Ordinance.

The learned District Judge failed to analyse and evaluate the

evidence in the proper perspective. The High Court merely

endorsed the conclusion of the District Court.

I answer the question of law raised on behalf of the defendant in

the affirmative and set aside the judgments of the District Court

and the High Court and allow the appeal with costs. The

consequential question of law raised on behalf of the plaintiff does

not arise for consideration here.

The plaintiff lent Rs. 100,000 to the defendant with interest at a

rate of 20% per annum. This happened on 07.03.2000. Indeed,

SC/APPEAL/18/2021 17

the defendant could not pay the money with interest within two

years as agreed. After the lapse of two years, the plaintiff took up

the position that deed P2 is an outright transfer, thereby

preventing the defendant from repaying the money to effect a

retransfer of the property.

Taking all the circumstances into account, I direct that the

defendant deposit a total sum of Rs. 870,303.35 (calculated at a

compound annual interest rate of 10% from 07.03.2000 to

17.11.2022) to the credit of the case within five months from today

for the plaintiff to withdraw. If the money is so deposited with

notice to the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall retransfer the property in

the name of the defendant within one month thereof. If the

plaintiff fails to do so, the Registrar of the District Court shall

effect the transfer. All expenses of the conveyance of the property

shall be borne by the defendant. The Registrar of this Court shall

transmit the case record to the District Court forthwith for the

parties to comply with these directions.
