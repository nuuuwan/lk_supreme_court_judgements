S. Thurairaja, PC, J

The Petitioners of this instant case filed Petition dated 29/01/2021 alleging that

the 11th Respondent was promoted to the rank of an Inspector of Police contrary to

the guidelines and alleged a violation of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners. On

26/03/2021 this Court granted Leave to Proceed on the alleged infringement of Article

12 (1) and 14(1) (g) of the Constitution.

Dola Mullage Gunarathna (Hereinafter referred to as the 1st Petitioner) joined

the Sri Lanka Police Service as a Police Constable under the Regular Officer cadre on

20/10/1985. He was promoted to Police Sergeant on 12/12/1993. He was subsequently

promoted as a Sub-Inspector (SI) on 01/01/2006 and thereafter by order of seniority

and merit was promoted to Inspector of Police (IP) with effect from 31/05/2016. The

1st Petitioner is currently attached to the Police Station of Matara.

Mallika Arachchige Lakshman (Hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Petitioner)

joined the Sri Lanka Police as a Police Constable under the Regular Officer cadre on

26/03/1986 and was promoted to Police Sergeant on 01/12/1993. Subsequently he

was promoted as a Sub Inspector (SI) on 01/01/2006 and thereafter by order of

seniority and merit was promoted as an Inspector of Police (IP) with effect from

31/05/2016. The 2nd Petitioner is currently attached to the Senior Deputy Inspector

General’s (Administration) Office.

The 1st – 8th Respondents are the Chairman, members, and Secretary of the

National Police Commission (NPC) established in terms of the Constitution of Sri Lanka,

which is empowered inter alia to effect/approve promotions to the Police Officers. The

9th Respondent is the Inspector General of Police (IGP) while the 10th Respondent is

the Hon. Attorney General; made party to the application as a matter of the

Constitution. The 11th Respondent is an Inspector of Police.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 23

The Petitioners stated that the 11th Respondent was promoted to the rank of IP

on 04/12/2019 with effect from 01/01/2019 and the promotion of the 11th Respondent

as an IP was backdated to 08/02/2010 by IGP’s communique dated 18/12/2019

bearing No 699 of the RTM marked as P2. The Petitioners stated that P2 is done

without proper evaluation or following the guidelines laid down in the letter dated

22/01/2018 marked P9. Further, they stated that the backdating of this promotion has

been done wrongfully and in an ad hoc manner.

The Petitioners states that they became aware of RTM No 699 marked P2 in the

second week of January 2020 reasoning the fact that the individual promotions are

given less attention in periodic meetings and in practice the RTMs are not issued to

Officers in Charge of District, Stations, Headquarters and Inspectors; examples marked

R9 (1) – R9 (4), P3A, P3B and P5.

The Petitioners stated that the 11th Respondent is lower in seniority and has less

experience in the police department compared to the Petitioners. The Petitioners filed

the instant application challenging the above promotion of the 11th Respondent

amounted to a violation of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under

Article 12 (1) and 14(1) (g) of the Constitution. Hence, the Petitioners prayed for an

order to quash the said decision of backdating the promotion.

The Facts

In 2016, by IGP’s communique bearing no. RTM 769 dated 20/09/2016 marked

P3A, applications were called for promotions to the rank of IP from eligible SIs

including the Petitioners. Subsequently upon an interview process, 539 SIs were

promoted including the Petitioners to the rank of IP with effect from 31/05/2016. The

11th Respondent was not eligible to apply for the promotion of IP since he has not

completed the mandatory service period of 10 years. RTM 112 (CRTM 251) dated

04/12/2019 marked P5 supports the fact that 474 SIs who had not been granted

promotions for a considerable period of time were promoted to the rank of IP purely

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 23

based on service periods which took effect from 01/012019 and the 11th Respondent

was also promoted under this scheme.

The Petitioners provided that on 20/01/2020, in response to an application

made under Right to Information Act, the Petitioners received the report of the

recommendations made by the then Acting IGP (9A Respondent) to the National Police

Commission dated 01/10/2019 marked P8 recommending not to backdate the

promotion of the 11th Respondent and furthermore recommended to quash such

order. The 6th Respondent too had recommended not to backdate the promotion of

11th Respondent in the same manner.

Subsequently the 11th Respondent was promoted as an SI in 2007 and this

promotion was backdated to 22/12/2001 pursuant to CRTM 1582 dated 26/07/2019

marked P6. The Petitioner states that the promotion of the 11th Respondent to the

rank of SI under “special” scheme effected by P6 also is done without proper evaluation

or following the guidelines laid down in the letter dated 22/01/2018 marked P9.

The Petitioners further stated that the 11th Respondent cannot backdate his

promotion subsequent to the terms of the letter issued by the NPC dated 31/05/2019

marked P4 and P4A which provides six conditions to approve a promotion under ‘time

based promotion scheme’ and one such condition is that “no officer shall be entitled

to backdate his/her promotion granted under this time based promotion scheme.” The

Petitioners stated, claiming eligibility to backdate the promotion of SI of the 11th

Respondent to 22/12/2001 on an alleged ‘Special’ basis cannot be granted under any

time based promotion scheme.

A number of SIs who were affected by the promotions of the 11th Respondent

has also filed a fundamental rights application bearing No. SC/FR 333/2019. It was

further submitted to this Court in the Petition that the Petitioners preferred appeals to

the NPC and also made complaints to the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 23

(HRCSL) on 16/01/2020. The Petitioners stated in their Petition that to date, no

response has been received in respect of the appeals made to the NPC and the HRCSL.

The Petitioners stated in their written submissions that they appealed to the IGP

and the NPC to rectify these anomalies. They state that the IGP properly evaluated the

seniority, merits and services of the Petitioners and the 11th Respondent. Thereafter,

the IGP arrived at a determination to make recommendations to the NPC to backdate

the IP promotions of the Petitioners to be effective from 08/02/2010 marked P10.

However, to date, the recommendations of the IGP have not been implemented and

the Petitioners alleged that, the failure of the Respondents to implement the said

recommendation of the regular and properly evaluated promotion is equivalent to

denying their legitimate expectation in respect of their career progression.

In the aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioners stated that the 11th Respondent

gained an unfair advantage by the promotion backdated to 08/02/2010 that took

effect from 01/01/2019. The Petitioners further state that the 11th Respondent is able

to claim seniority over the Petitioners in the IP rank if the promotion becomes valid.

Subsequent to filling this application, the 11th Respondent was also promoted to the

rank of Chief Inspector (CI) with effect from 08/02/2020 marked P11 as a result of the

promotions to the rank of IP and SI being backdated. Therefore, the Petitioners state

that this will entitle the 11th Respondent to claim priority in promotions to the next

ranks and the Petitioners will be placed lower in seniority as their promotion to the

rank of IP was effected from 31/05/2016.

The Petitioners prayed the Court to direct any order or judgment on the

recruitment and promotions of Police Officers In view of the 20th Amendment to the

Constitution and in terms of the Police Ordinance read with the Constitutional

provisions in relation to the NPC and now the Public Service Commission (PSC) that

made 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 7b, 7c and 8a Respondents as parties to this application

respectively.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 23

This Court granted leave to proceed on the alleged infringement of Article 12

(1) and 14 (1) g of the Constitution and made an order suspending RTM 699 dated

18/12/2019 marked ‘P2’ from taking effect till the final determination was in order.

Objections and written submissions of the Respondents

The 11th Respondent filed his preliminary objection in relation to the petition

on 09/03/2021. Written Submissions on behalf of the 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 7b, 7c,

9 and 10th Respondents was filed. The Respondents established their position based

on two factors; the Petition is time barred and the Promotion of the 11th Respondent

has not violated any fundamental rights of the Petitioners in terms of Article 12(1) and

14(1) (g) of the constitution.

In order to establish the fact that the Petition is time barred, the 11th

Respondent and 1-10th Respondents stated that, pursuant to Article 126(2) of the

Constitution, the fundamental rights application should have been filed by the

Petitioners within the stipulated time period of one month.

The 11th Respondent stated that the 2nd Petitioner is a co-worker who works

with him in the same office of S/DIG Administration since 2016 and it is unbelievable

that the two Petitioners only became aware of the decision of the promotion of the

11th Respondent or the RTM No 699 marked P2 around the second week of January.

The 11th Respondent further contends that the Petitioners are holding back the exact

date they became aware of the P2 document is to deceitfully accommodate their

Petition within the required legal time frame.

Prior to the aforesaid RTM No 699 marked P2, the Acting Inspector General of

Police sought the approval of the commission to promote the 11th Respondent to the

rank of IP with the recommendation for the promotion to take effect from 08/02/2010

marked R1. The commission (1stto 8th Respondents) considered the contents of R1 and

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 23

approved the promotion to the rank of IP on the letter dated 05/08/2019 marked R2.

The letter marked R2 received at the Police Head Quarters on 06/08/2019.

In relation to the aforementioned circumstance, the 11th Respondent stated that

the Petitioners had an ample time of five months to commence a proceeding under

the same course of action whereas the Petitioners had failed to do so, thus the

Petitioners has deliberately avoided disclosing the acknowledged R2 in their Petition.

Moreover, the 11th Respondent states that the P2 document is a RTM (Routine

Telephone Message) used for general purposes of communication, common to all

officials and offices. In the abbreviation RTM, the word “Routine” indicates that such

communications are done in routine basis and all such documents are accessible to all

the police officers since they are generally used for administrative purposes. He further

submits that the common circulation of RTMs is such that all ranks at the receiving end

becomes aware of the contents particularly when it relates to a promotion or a matter

of common interest of Police officers.

Secondly, the 11th Respondent states that the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners in terms of Article 12(1) and 14(1) (g) of the constitution were not violated

given the circumstances of the case.

The 11th Respondent stated that he was recommended for a special promotion

to the Rank of SI by the Staff DIG in the year 2001 and that whilst this special promotion

was pending, in 2007 he was promoted to the rank of SI under the Merit and Seniority

Scheme 2007 marked P10. After this promotion was granted, the 11th Respondent

stated that he made an appeal to the Senior DIG Western Province and FFHQ to

backdate his promotion. Consequent to the appeal, the Senior DIG Western Province

and FFHQ has recommended to backdate his promotion to the rank of SI marked R5

dated 05/07/2011 based on the special promotion scheme.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 23

In pursuing this special recommendation for special promotion, the 11th

Respondent stated that he made an appeal to the 9A Respondent to backdate his

promotion in the rank of SI and to promote him from the post of SI to IP on a basis of

timely promotion from the date of issuance of the promotion orders. The 9A

Respondent has made his observations in favour of the 11th Respondent by the letter

dated 17/07/2019 marked R3. In an attempt to rectify the position marked at P8, the

report of the recommendations made by the 9A Respondent to the National Police

Commission dated 01/10/2019, the 9A Respondent submitted a letter dated

07/12/2019 marked R6 seeking further instructions to restore the backdating of the

promotion of the 11th Respondent to the rank of IP. The 11th Respondent contested

that, in response to P8, NPC referred to the 9A Respondent to act according to the

contents of R2 dated 05/08/2019. Hence, NPC approved the claim of restoration to the

rank of IP by the letter marked R7 dated 13/12/2019 and he was granted the

entitlement for the promotion via RTM No: 699 dated 18/12/2019.

The 11th Respondent stated that the decision made by the Commission cannot

be alleged as arbitrary or ad hoc since all the seven members of the Commission are

personally involved in every decision made by the Commission.

The 11th Respondent stated that the documents marked P2 and P6 by the NPC

follows the due process laid down in the guidelines marked P9 dated 22/01/2018. He

further submits that the documents marked P4 and P4A dated 31/05/2019 have no

relevancy to the backdating of his promotion since the matter is dealt with separately

outside the instructions in P4 and P4A. However, the 11th Respondents also admits that

he was not eligible to apply for the promotions called for the rank of IP in the year

2016 marked P3A since he had not completed the mandatory period of 10 years of

service.

Pursuant to RTM No: 252 marked R11 dated 08/02/2010, the 11th Respondent

argued that the 1st and 2nd Petitioners’ promotion as an IP cannot be backdated to

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 23

08/02/2010 because both the Petitioners may not have completed the required period

of eight years as an SI from the date of dating. Thus, they may lack nearly four years

to be eligible for the promotion of IP whereas the 11th Respondent have completed

the required period by 08/02/2010. Therefore the 11th Respondent contests that both

the Petitioners cannot be treated equally in terms of Article 12(1) and 14(1) (g).x

Furthermore, the 11th Respondent stated in the objections that career progression in

the police force entirely depends on performance, knowledge, discipline, initiative and

the commitment of every individual officer rather than seniority in service or age alone.

Time Bar objection

Article 17 and Article 126(2) of the constitution requires a fundamental rights

application to be filled within one month of the alleged violation and the time limit set

out in Article 126(2) is mandatory; Edirisuriya v Navaratnam (1985 1 SLR 100 at

p.105 – 106). This court quoted in the case of Demuni Sriyani De Soyza and others

v Dharmasena Dissanayake, Public Service Commission and others SC/FR

206/2008 (S.C.M – 9th December 2016), that:

“Where the time period of one month to be computed not from the date of

occurrence of the alleged infringement but from the day the Petitioner

becomes aware of the alleged infringement – in the decision cited by De Alwis

J, namely, SIRIWARDENE V RODRIGO, Ranasinghe J, as he then was held [at

p.387] “Where however, a Petitioner establishes that he became aware of such

infringement, or the imminent infringement, not on the very day the act

complained of was so committed, but only subsequently on a later date, then,

in such a case, the said petition of one month will be computed only from the

date on which such petitioner did in fact become aware of such infringement

and was in a position to take effective steps to come before this court.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 23

This principle has been reiterated time and again. It should be added here that,

if the facts and circumstances of an application make it clear that, a Petitioner,

by the standards of a reasonable man, should have become aware of the

alleged infringement by a particular date, the time limit of one month will

commence from the date on which he should have become aware of the

alleged infringement”.

In the instant case, I find it pertinent to determine the date on which the Petitioners

had knowledge of the alleged infringement. The Respondents stated in their objection

that the approval letter backdating the promotion of the 11th Respondent received to

the Police Headquarters on 06/08/2019 marked R2 and specified further that the

Petitioners had knowledge of the promotion letter. When I perused the document

marked R2, it was apparent that P2 was a directive order sent by the Acting IGP as then

to the NPC approving the backdating of the promotions of the 11th Respondent. Thus,

it makes it clear that the Petitioners may not have access to those letters and only the

relevant authorities would be privy to its contents.

Further, the Petitioners stated in their Petition that they became aware of the RTM

No 699 dated 18/12/2019, marked P2 around the second week of January. The

Petitioners should have invoked the jurisdiction of this court within one month from

the RTM No 699 dated 18/12/2019, by which the backdating of the promotion of the

11th Respondent was communicated. In this regard, I find it relevant to point out that

the Petitioners ought to have had knowledge of the circulation of RTM orders since

such documents are general communications between all officials and officers. Hence,

by the standards of a reasonable man, the Petitioners should have become aware of

the alleged infringement by a particular date.

In Illangaratne v Kandy Muncipal Council (1995) BALJ Vol.VI Part-1 p.10,

Kulatunga J held that:

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 23

“… it would not suffice for the Petitioner to merely assert that he personally

had no knowledge of the discriminatory act, if on an objective assessment of

the evidence he ought to have had such knowledge.”

An exception to this rule, however, is found in the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka, Act No 21 of 1996. This Act empowers the Human Rights Commission of

Sri Lanka to entertain complaints in respect of violations of fundamental rights

guaranteed by the Constitution.

Section 13(1) of the Act reads as follows:

“Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14 to

the Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent

infringement of a fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the

period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the

commission shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one

month within which an application may be made to the Supreme Court by

such person in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution.”

In the light of this section, the Petitioners can avoid the time bar, if the

application to the Human Rights Commission was made within one month of the

alleged infringement. By virtue of the aforesaid provision time would not run during

the pendency of proceedings before the Commission. This view was fortified in the

case of Romesh Cooray vs. Jayalath, Sub-Inspector Of Police And Others, (2008)

2 SLR 43

Accordingly, the Petitioners have lodged a complaint to HRCSL as evidenced by

the document marked P7C. Pursuant to P13 the complaints made to HRCSL have been

acknowledged and HRCSL has requested the Petitioners to refer the complaint to the

NPC to seek relief. However, the Petitioners have filed their petition at the Supreme

Courts two days before the response received from the HRCSL.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 23

The dates that are material to ascertain the time bar objection are follows; date

of the RTM No 699 marked P2 is 18/12/2019, the date of filing the complaint before

the HRCSL by the 1st Petitioner is 16/01/2020 and the date of acknowledgement by

the HRCSL is 31/01/2020 and the date of fundamental rights Application to the

Supreme Court is 29/01/2020. Thus, it is evident that the Petitioners have filed the

complaint before the HRCSL within 30 days from the date of release of the RTM No

699 which is exactly two days to one month from the date of filing the action before

the HRCSL.

The premise that the complaint was filed on the 16/01/2020, which is a date

that falls within the second week of January, stipulates that the Petitioners should have

become aware of the alleged infringement on that particular date. Hence, the time

freezes pursuant to provision 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act No 21 of

1996. Therefore, I’m of the view that the Petitioners have filed the fundamental rights

application before this Court within the required time frame in terms of Article 126(2)

and I overrule the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents.

Backdating the Promotion of the 11th Respondent

In the objections filed before this court, the position of the 11th Respondent is

that on 17/07/2019 marked R3, the 9A Respondent has recommended to backdate the

promotion of the 11th Respondent to the rank of SI to 21/12/2001 and the Petitioners’

contention is that on 01/10/2019, the 9A Respondent has strongly recommended not

to backdate the 11th Respondent’s SI promotion pursuant to the elucidations provided

in P8.

On perusing the documents before me, I find it relevant to discuss the contents

of R3 in relation to P8. The 9A Respondent specified in R3 that the special promotion

of the 11th Respondent recommended by the Staff DIG in the year 2001 marked D4

was not approved by the then IGP Mr. Lucky Kodithuwakku due to his demise. Further,

in 2011, the Senior DIG Western Province and FFHQ, Mr. Ashoka Wijetilleke,

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 23

recommended a special promotion in this respect which was also not approved by the

former IGP Mr. Mahinda Balasuriya as he resigned following the death of a person

during a protest at the Katunayake Free Trade Zone. Therefore further action was not

taken on approving the special promotion of the 11th Respondent in the year 2011.

In consideration of all the above reasons, the 9A Respondent has backdated the

promotion of the 11th Respondent to the rank of SI taking effect from 22/12/2001.

Also, it is established in the enumerated facts of this case that the NPC has approved

the claim of restoration of the 9A Respondent marked R7 rectifying the position stated

in P8. I further validate the fact that, the NPC is the proper authority to rectify the

position of the 11th Respondent as it stood before Article 55(4) of the 17th Amendment

to the Constitution. The case of Abeywickrama v Pathirana (1986) 1 Sri LR 120

stated in its judgement as following;

“Article 55(4) empowers the Cabinet of Ministers to make rules for all matters

relating to public officers, without impinging upon the overriding powers of

pleasure recognized under Article 55(1). Matters relating to public officers

comprehends all matters relating to employment, which are incidental to

employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment,

such as provisions as to salary, increments, leave, gratuity, pension, and of

superannuity, promotion and every termination of employment and removal

of service.”

Further, the Sri Lanka Police Orders A5 part IV of the Special Promotion of the

Police Department provided in the document marked R15 defines that;

“any police officer who deserves to be promoted on the basis of special skills

such as heroism, special status, honour to the country and special reputation

that brings him more fame in the police service, then he should be promoted

to the rank of service or skill appropriate to the matter, at the discretion of the

Inspector General”

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 23

As per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka, Article 155G (1) (a) provides;

“The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of

police officers other than the Inspector General of Police, shall be vested in the

commission. The commission shall exercise its powers of promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal in consultation with the Inspector General of

Police.”

In consideration of the documents presented by both the counsels in this

regard, it is clear that the 11th Respondent has obtained the approval of backdating

the promotion of the rank of SI through a special promotion at the discretion of the

IGP (9A Respondent) and the commission has exercised its powers in consultation with

the IGP pursuant to Article 155G (1) (a). The decision of the commission was based on

the commendations given to the 11th Respondent and the special promotion was

granted by the Inspector General pursuant to the Sri Lanka Police Orders A5 part IV.

Furthermore, I find that the backdating of the promotion of the 11th Respondent

to the rank of SI does not fall within the ambit of P4 and P4A. Subsequently to address

the contention made by the Petitioners in relation to CRTM 1582 marked P6,

paragraph 07 of R3 is corresponding to the principle 02(I) of P9 which provides that

the 11th Respondent has earned two special increments in special IGP compliments in

five occasions during his 27 years of service as a police officer. P6 abides by Paragraphs

02 (III) and 02 (IV) of P9 as already established in the aforementioned analysis.

Further, the principle stated in paragraph 02 (II) of P9 is provided in section 30

and 31 of the procedural rules promulgated by the Public Service Commission. It states

as follows;

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 23

‘the date of the letter of appointment or the date on which the officer assumes

duties, whichever comes later, shall be the effective date of the appointment.

No appointment, for whatever reason, shall be ante-dated.’

However, section 188 of chapter XVII provides that,

‘Notwithstanding the provision contain in Section 31 , in the case of the grade

to grade promotion in service is made belatedly owing to some unavoidable

circumstances and where it appears to the Appointing Authority that the Public

Officer is in no way responsible for such delay and on perusal of eligibility it is

proved that the officer has qualified himself for promotion in all respects, the

Appointing Authority shall promote the officer with effect from the due date

despite the fact that the officer may no longer in service or is retired or dead.’

On perusing the facts stated by the 9A Respondent in the contents of R3, it is

evident that the 11th Respondent’s special promotion was belated due to plausible

reasons and therefore the NPC had to promote the 11th Respondent to the rank of SI

with effect from the due date pursuant to the above-mentioned section 188. Thus, in

totality I agree that the special promotion of the 11th Respondent is being granted

following the clear and definite criteria pursuant to 02 (V) of P9. Hence, backdating of

the SI promotion of the 11th Respondent on an alleged special scheme is valid.

I would now turn to examine the backdating of the promotion of the 11th

Respondent to the rank of IP. The 11th Respondent’s stance is that, his promotion to

the post of SI was granted on 22/12/2001 and therefore his promotion to the post of

IP was backdated to 08/02/2010 granted under time-based promotion scheme. In

these circumstances, I find it pertinent to discuss the main issue, when backdating the

promotion of the 11th Respondent to the rank of IP, the service performed by the 11th

Respondent as an SI is appreciated twice under two promotion schemes; the special

promotion scheme and the Merit and seniority scheme.

The question that arises before this court is that whether a police officer can

benefit under two promotion schemes for the same position in the first place. In the

case of The Public Services United Nurses Union v Montague Jayawickrama,

Minister of Public Administration and others (1988) 1 Sri LR 229, the decision of

Cabinet of Ministers to award two increments to the nurses who were members of the

rival trade union was challenged by the Petitioner under Article 12 (1) of the

constitution. Wanasundara J was of the view that, an increment in the public service

has to be earned by a public officer by satisfactory work and conduct during a specified

period of time and any stoppage, postponement or deprivation of an increment has

to be a penalty consequent to the disciplinary action taken against the public officer;

and held awarding a particular public officer with two increments, places the other

officers at a disadvantage and goes against the legitimate expectation of the public

servants whose expectations are based on the principles of the Administrative

Regulations.

The Supreme Court of India in the case of Govind Dattatray Kelkar v Chief

Controller of Imports [1967] 2 S.C.R. 29 held that;

“There can be cases where the differences between the two groups of recruits

may not be sufficient to give any preferential treatment to one against the

other in the matter of promotions, and in that event a Court may hold that

there is no reasonable nexus between the differences and the recruitment.”

On the review of the above, it is evident that even awarding satisfactory work

with two increments to a specific individual goes against the legitimate expectation of

another. Similarly, the 11th Respondent satisfying the requirements under two different

promotion schemes cannot be extended to gain the advantages of a particular

promotion twice when the majority of the candidates received such benefits only once

in a lifetime. In Surendran v University Grants Commission and Another [1993] 1

SLR 344 it was observed that when two sources are clubbed together, the courts have

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 23

considered such a source to be as one source of medium leading to the ultimate

objective. Herein the instant case, the purpose of both the schemes under which the

11th Respondent was promoted leads to one nature of work and therefore the

differences between the two sources cannot be justified by the facts and circumstances

of this case.

The case of Weligodapola v Secretary, Minister of Women Affairs and

teaching hospital and others 1989 2 SLR 63, held that

“The law recognizes that the principles of equality does not mean that every

law must have universal application’ for all persons who are not, by nature,

attainment or circumstances in the same position. What is required is that

persons who by nature, attainment or circumstances are similar are treated

alike. If there is a classification which deals alike with those who are similarly

situated, someone who is different cannot be allowed to complain that he has

not been treated equally; for being different, he must necessarily expect to be

treated differently.

The Petitioners right to equality must be protected in all stages of service and it is

noteworthy that several channels can serve as a medium for a promotion to a position

and any candidate can be eligible for a promotion under two different schemes but

cannot compete through two mediums, to be promoted twice for the same position.

Allowing such an opportunity to one individual may create disparities among the

others’ individual rights.

The case of Ganga Ram v Union of India [1970] 1 S.C.C. 377 emphasized that;

“The equality of opportunity takes within its fold all stages of service from

initial appointment to its termination including promotion but it does not

prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for selection and promotion,

applicable to all members of a classified group.”

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 23

Our courts in Perera and Another v Cyril Ranathunga, Secretary Defence and

others (1993) 1 SLR 39 cited the case of Jaisinghani v Union of India 1967 AIR (SC)

427 in which it was held;

“the concept of equality in the matter of promotions can be predict only when

the promotes are drawn from the same source. If the preferential treatment of

one source in relation to the other is based on the differences between the said

two sources, and the said differences have a reasonable relation to the nature

of the office or offices to which recruitment is made, the said recruitment can

legitimately be sustained on the basis of valid classification.”

The court upheld the scheme for recruitment from two sources and stated that

the objective of such classification is to fill the posts with officers with first rate

experience and those who possess a high degree of ability to serve in the Income Tax

Service. Herein the instant case before our court, I emphasize the fact that even such

officers referred in the case of Jaisinghani v Union of India would not be given the

opportunity to be promoted twice from two different sources to the same position

although both the sources have a reasonable connection to the nature of the office.

The right to equality of opportunity in matters of public employment expressly

provided by Article 16(1) of the Indian Constitution is implicit in Article 12 of the Sri

Lankan Constitution that is in par with the concept of the rule of law. Hence, on the

survey of all the decisions of the above judgments, I’m of the opinion that the

Petitioners can have a legitimate grievance in that aspect.

Determination

The objection of the Respondents providing the fact that that the Petition is

time barred is overruled. However, the special promotion is cumbersome because such

sudden backdating of positions allows persons who do not have adequate training

and expertise to hold posts whereby the police services will suffer. Therefore, the

procedure of the NPC is not up to satisfaction and is detrimental to the police service.

SC FR 18/2020 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 23

If inexperienced officers are promoted on technical grounds, the expectation of the

public is not fulfilled. Therefore, under this situation the backdating of the 11th

Respondent of the promotion to the rank of IP in 01/01/2019 to 08/02/2010 is invalid.

Considering all, I hold that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined

under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) have been violated. Accordingly, I quash the

communication dated 18/12/2019 bearing RTM No.699 marked as P2.

Application Allowed.
