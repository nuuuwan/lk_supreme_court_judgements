ARGUED ON : 10th January 2022.

DECIDED ON : 5th May 2022

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

At the time of institution of this action, all Petitioners were Police Constables.

The 1st Respondent was the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the 2nd Respondent was

the Chairman and the 3rd to 8th Respondents were members of the National Police

Commission, all of whom have been substituted by the 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A,

8B, 8C Respondents in accordance with changes to the positions occurring subsequent

to this application, as reflected by the amended caption filed by the Petitioners on 22nd

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 16

March 2021. The 9th Respondent is the Attorney General who has been made a party

in compliance with the law.

The Petitioners instituted this action against the Respondents claiming a

violation of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights due to the promotion scheme

adopted by the Respondents. The Court was inclined to grant Leave to Proceed in

terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners stated that they joined the Department of Police as Police

Constables in the Regular Service and were serving in the same rank attached to police

stations. The Petitioners years of service as according to the Petition are such that as

at 31.05.2018, the 1st Petitioner was in service for 22 years, the 2nd Petitioner for 19

years and 7 months, the 3rd,16th,22nd, 23rd Petitioners for 19 years, the 4th and 27th

Petitioners for 17 years and 6 months, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 18th, 20th Petitioners for 21 years,

8th Petitioner for 28 years, 9th Petitioner for 16 years and 9 months, 10th and 17th

Petitioners for 21 years and 6 months, 11th Petitioner for 17 years and 8 months, 12th

Petitioner for 17 years and 5 months, 13th and 15th Petitioners for 16 years and 9

months, 14th Petitioner for 17 years and 10 months, 19th Respondent for 18 years and

11 months, 21st Petitioner for 19 years and 4 months, 24th Petitioner for 18 years and

9 months, 25th Petitioner for 18 years and the 26th Petitioner for 18 years and 11

months.

The Petitioners state that in terms of Article 155G of the Constitution, powers

pertaining to appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of

Police Officers other than IGP is vested in the National Police Commission and that in

regard to promotions of Police Constables, the 1st Respondent IGP is exercising the

delegated powers of the National Police Commission.

The Petitioners stated that being Police constables, they were in the lowest rank

of the Department and their next rank was the rank of Sergeant. During the subsistence

of proceedings, it was brought to the attention of this Court that the

1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th,8th,11th,12th,21st and 22nd Respondents were promoted to the rank of

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 16

Police Sergeant. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that even though

the abovementioned Petitioners were promoted they are contesting the effective date

of the promotions. In these circumstances, objections and counter affidavits were filed

before this Court.

The Petitioners state that as per their knowledge there has been no consistent

criteria and policy with regard to making promotions to the rank of sergeant and

mention mechanisms adopted in previous years based on an examination, interview,

and subsequently for those with over 16 years of service (2006) and 20 years (2010)

without interview or examination.

The Petitioners state that by RTM No. 772 dated 20.9.2016 (annexed as P3) , the

1st Respondent called for applications for promotion to the rank of Police Sergeant/

Women Police Sergeant based on period of service and merit. According to the criteria

laid down in the said RTM, officers who had completed 15 years active period of service

by 31.05.2016 and having unblemished service during the immediate 3 years were

eligible to apply. As per the Petitioners, the said Promotion Scheme to promotions in

2016 (annexed as P4) allocated 70 marks for seniority and 30 marks for merit, the latter

of which was given considering maximum of 5 marks each for the criteria of Special

Educational Qualifications, Special Professional Qualifications, Service in Operational

Areas prior to 01.06.2009, Special Skills, Medals, and the Interview. They state that in

the maximum 5 marks of Special Professional Qualifications, 1 mark each was given

for 1 year of service in Special Divisions, accordingly Special Divisions included 13

Divisions including the Presidential Security Division, Retired Presidents Security

Division, Prime Minister Security Division, Ministerial Security Division, and Criminal

Investigation Department.

The Petitioners state that this Promotion Scheme gave due weightage to

seniority for period of service as the post of Constable is the lowest rank and that such

preference for seniority is fair as otherwise officers with long periods of service would

stagnate in the same lowest rank.

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 16

The Petitioners state that by RTM No. 442 dated 11.07.2018 (annexed as P5),

the 1st Respondent called for applications from Police Constables/ Women Police

Constables for promotion to the rank of Police Sergeant/Woman Police Sergeant. In

terms of P5, the threshold qualifications for promotions included being confirmed in

service, 10 years active period of service by 31.05.2018 and 3 years satisfactory service

prior to 31.05.2018. This 10-year period is a reduction from the minimum period of 15

years in 2016 and 20 years in 2010.

The Petitioners state that this Promotion Scheme was also published on the

Virtual Private Network (VPN) of the Police Department used by Police to distribute

information within the Department through the internet.

As per the Petitioners, the Promotion Scheme adopted in 2018 (annexed as P6)

allocated only 50 marks for seniority and 50 marks for merit. The former 50 marks were

given by giving 4 marks for each 1 year of service, meaning that even an officer with

10 years service would be entitled to 40 of 50 marks for seniority and an officer with

12 and half years would obtain all 50 marks.

The Petitioners further state that in terms of Clause 2.2.12 of the said Scheme,

maximum 10 marks were available for Special Professional Qualifications. Marks had

been allocated considering 1 mark each for 1 year of service at Special Divisions,

which consists of 19 such recognized divisions, 6 of which were not identified under

the 2016 scheme.

The Petitioners state that on or about 01.12.2018 they became aware that by

RTM No. 1003 dated 30.11.2018 (annexed as P7) issued by the 1st Respondent-IGP, it

was informed that 1737 Police Constables have been promoted to the rank of Sergeant

with effect from 31.05.2018. The said list of promotees had then been published on

the VPN of the Police Department. The Petitioners state that in addition to the names

of the said 1737 promoted officers, names of 46 officers who have been selected but

listed in a waiting list pending the conclusion of court cases and disciplinary inquiries

were also published. The Petitioners state that the Petitioners had not received

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 16

promotions to the rank of Sergeant. The Petitioners state that upon perusal of the said

list of 1737 promotees, the Petitioners discovered that approximately 665 promotees

are from the said 'Special Divisions' and are mainly from the Presidential Security

Division, Retired President's Security Division and the Ministerial Security Division. The

Petitioners state that they have become aware that most of the other promotees,

though are presently serving in police stations or other divisions, have served in such

Special Divisions for part of their period of service.

The Petitioners state that this scheme undermined seniority and has allowed

junior officers to be promoted owing to service in Special Divisions. The Petitioners

state that it is discriminatory to Police Officers serving at Police Stations and claims

that the 1st- 8th Respondents have infringed the Petitioners Fundamental Rights under

Article 12(1). In terms of the date of promotions, the Petitioners sought direction of

the Respondents to promote Petitioners to the rank of Sergeant with effect from

31.05.2018 and to declare the promotions granted to the rank of Police Sergeant as

set out in P7 as null and void.

The Respondents agree in terms of the content of P5 and P6 but state that the

Promotion marking scheme of 2016 was amended in 2018 to uplift the quality of the

Police Service and introduced equal weightage to merit as well as seniority. It is stated

that the Promotion Scheme was applied uniformly to ensure that officers who are not

only experienced, but display knowledge and skill were promoted over those who

possess only seniority, for best performance at the next rank. The Respondents state

that this was a matter of Policy aimed at improving the efficiency of the Police Service.

The Respondents in their Written Submissions state that the Petitioners claim

is based solely on the promotion scheme of 2018 which the Petitioners admit to having

been aware of on or about 11.07.2018. The Respondents state that as the Petitioners

did not challenge the scheme until the application at Human Rights Commission on

17.12.2008, nearly 5 months from date of being aware of scheme, and as the

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 16

Petitioners did not raise objections at the stage of interviews, this application is time

barred.

In this regard, The Petitioners state that the application is not time barred given

that they were only aware of the preference to junior officers based on service at

Special Divisions and alleged undermining of seniority upon examining the list of

promotes, marked P7 on 1.12.2018. As such the Petitioners are of the view that the

application has been made within the time limit given that the Petition was filed on

30.12.2018. Further, the Petitioners state that the marks allocated for the Petitioners

were only disclosed upon filing this application by the document marked R annexed

to the Affidavit of the 1A Respondent, which the Petitioners state was a decisive factor

in the decision of Petitioners promotions.

As this Court has previously enumerated numerous times, an application being

time barred has dire consequences upon the same. As stated by the Judgement in

Demuni Sriyani De Soyza and Others v Dharmasena Dissanayake, Chairman,

Public Service Commission and Others, S.C.F.R 206/2008 (S.C Minutes dated

9.12.2016) by Hon. Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, PC:

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution stipulates that, a person who alleges

that any of his fundamental rights have been infringed or are about to be

infringed by executive or within one month thereof apply to this Court by

way administrative action may . Within one month thereof. apply to

this Court by way of a Petition praying for relief or redress in respect of

such infringement. The consequence of this stipulation in Article 126 (2) is

that a Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one month from

the time the alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred and

unmaintainable. This rule is so well known that it hardly needs to be stated

here.

In the instant case, It is to be noted that the basis of the Petitioners application

is the Promotion Scheme marked P5, which was communicated by RTM and P6 which

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 16

was published on the VPN Network of the Police Department specifically intended for

use by police to distribute information within the Department. The Petitioners have

only complained of unfairness of the promotion scheme following P7 wherein the

Petitioners did not receive promotions. The promotion scheme has been applied

uniformly to all applicants and promotions were given as according to the Scheme

announced on 11.07.2018, over 4 and half months prior to the results as in P7 dated

30.11.2018. Thereafter, an additional month has elapsed in the Petitioner filing the

Petition at this Court. As such, this application is time barred.

Additionally, I do not find any patent unfairness to the Promotion Scheme

marked P6 as the objectives of this promotion scheme, as explained by the

Respondents, are justified. Further, this Promotion Scheme has been applied uniformly

to all applicants including the Petitioners.

As was stated by Hon. Sripavan CJ in Wasantha Dissanayake and Others v

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and others, SCFR 611/12 (SC

Minutes 10.09.2015;

A scheme of recruitment once formulated is not good for ever; it is

perfectly within the competence of the appropriate authority to change it,

rechange it, adjust it and re-adjust it according to the compulsions of

changing circumstances. The Court cannot give directions as to how the

Public Service Commission should function except to state the obligation

not to act arbitrarily and to treat employees who are similarly situated

equally.

As such, the Respondents are justified in introducing a promotion scheme

different to that of the past as is suited to meet justifiable goals of the Police Force to

the extent that all parties are treated fairly by such mechanisms.

In terms of matters to be considered in promotion schemes, the recent

Judgement in the case of Kaluwahandi Garwin Premalal Silva and Others v K. W. E.

Karaliyadda and Others, bearing No. SC FR 383/2016, (Supreme Court minutes

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 16

dated 16th December 2021) referred to the case of A. H. Wickramatunga and three

others Vs. H. R. de Silva and fourteen others SC (FR) 551/98 decided on 31-08-

2001, in which His Lordship Justice Fernando referred to the International Covenant

on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and stated:

.[I]n a scheme of promotion based on Seniority and Merit, sufficient

weightage must always be given to Merit based upon a proper assessment

of actual past performance: efficiency, productivity, timeliness, accuracy,

initiative, creativity, ability to work with others, co-operation etc. Article 7

of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

recognizes the right to an equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted

in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no

considerations other than those of seniority and competence.

As such, despite a change in the scheme, given that the requirements have

stayed within the scope of seniority and merit, albeit with different weightage as

required, there is no patent unfairness to this scheme.

The Petitioners received promotions soon after during the following year based

upon a Scheme as suited to them on a time-based system favouring seniority as was

preferred by the Petitioner. The Respondent has submitted that the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th,6th

,7th , 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th Petitioners

have subsequently been promoted to the rank of Police Sergeant with effect from

01.01.2019 under a time-based Promotion Scheme for officers in the post of Police

Constable. The 16th and 17th Petitioners have been placed in the reserved list of

promotees to the rank due to pending adverse reports against them. The Respondents

particularly state that the promotions of the Petitioners cannot be antedated

31.05.2018 given that these promotions were granted under a Time-based Promotion

Scheme as opposed to the 2018 Competitive promotion Scheme. I am inclined to

agree with this view given that the Petitioners have received the promotion that they

had originally claimed for by way of Petition.

SC FR 427/2018 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 16

To backdate the promotions and to alter promotions granted to the 1737 Police

Officers who received promotions under the Scheme of 2018 would be to infringe

upon the Fundamental Rights and Legitimate Expectations of those individuals, who

have not even been made party to this case by the Petitioner. Additionally, The SDSG

submitted before this Court that there is another Fundamental Rights Application

before this Court which is severely affected if this application is granted, which has not

been pleaded in the Petition.

As such, I find that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners as guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution have not been violated by the Respondents. I dismiss

this application without costs.

Application dismissed.
