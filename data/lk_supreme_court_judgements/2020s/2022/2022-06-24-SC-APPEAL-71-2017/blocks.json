    "text": "The idea of instituting testamentary proceedings is generally to administer the estate of the deceased person under the supervision of the court through the executor named in the Will, or through an administrator appointed by the court and, through that administration, to settle the liabilities of the estate and to collect the dues to the estate and, thereafter, distribute the estate among the legatees or the heirs as the case may be. Mere reading of the said Last Will indicates that the expectation of the testator at the time of making the Last Will was that estate be declared closed only after certain legatees get the money allocated to them through the Will after converting the rest and residue of the estate in to money. The first executrix named in the will was undoubtedly given a life time interest to enjoy the said rest and residue. (Whether the terminology used in the Will indicates a creation of a fideicommissum or a life interest will be discussed later.). Thus, it appears, the prayers in the plaint filed in the District Court seems to be reliefs that could have been gained even in the testamentary case filed in relation to the last will of Benedict de Andrado by the relevant legatees or their representative through intervention at the appropriate stage. In this regard I would like to refer to Meemanage Harold Fernando Vs Jayani Wimalarathna nee Fonseka S.C Appeal 56/2010 S.C minute dated 29.03.2012 where this court had expressed the view that the role of the judge in a testamentary action is not a mere spectator nor to be a rubber stamp. Thus, the judge has a supervisory role and even if the final account is filed, the court ex mere motu or on the instance of a party or an intervenient party can consider whether such account should be accepted or should make necessary orders for the proper accounting of the estate and distribution of assets before the estate being declared closed. Therefore, it appears that the legatees of the said will or their heirs who apparently were to gain benefit from the subject matter after converting it to cash, had not taken due interest to get proper orders in the said testamentary action filed in relation to the last will of said Benedict De Andrado, and now the plaintiffs, as the said legatees or their heirs, have filed a separate action to claim the said benefits for them.",

In Sunil Gotabaya Lamabadusuriya V Yasoma Champa Nilmini Abeygunawardena SC Appeal No 169/2011 decided on 06th April 2018, Prassanna Jayawardena PC, J while referring to authors such as Masdorp, Wille, Van Leeuwen, Grotius and Lee discussed the nature of a usufruct/life interest and points out that a life interest holder, even though has the power to exercise jus utendi and jus fruendi (Rights to use and enjoy the Property) in full measure, subject to his right to deal with his life interest, he does not have power to exercise jus disponendi (Right to alienate the property) or jus abutendi ( Right to demolish or diminish the property) which remains with the title holder who has the dominium over the property but who could not exercise it fully without the assent of the life interest holder .

Thus, when the term life interest is used in a testamentary disposition that belongs to the time when fideicommissum was valid, it has to be carefully scrutinized to see whether it refers to a simple life interest given to a person where the rights in remainder and/or reversion lies with another or whether it is a \u2018life interest\u2019 of a fiduciary of a fideicommissum who has the right to enjoy the property till his death with full dominium subject to the prohibition or bar to alienate.

On the other hand, as per section 217 of the Civil Procedure Code a decree to yield up possession is a stand-alone relief and it need not be a relief prayed along with a declaration of title. However, title is needed to be proved by the party claiming such relief of ejectment be given, if the cause of action is based on title. However, in this case no title to the impugned property had been pleaded and or raised as an issue by the Plaintiff Respondents other than the statements to the effect that the Defendants have no title to the property and they are entitled to the sale of property and to their share of cash as per the directions in the Will.

It is true that it was stated in Nonohamy V Punchihamy 31 NLR 220 that where a final account has been filed in administration proceedings and the estate is declared closed, the court has no power to reopen proceedings in order to entertain a claim to share of the estate on the ground that the claimant is an heir. However, in Aron Fernando V Buddhadasa (1986) 2 Sri L R 285 it was decided that an Administrator is functus officio only when he has duly completed the administration of estate. Closing of the proceedings or rendering of a final account or even a judicial settlement of the estate will not make the administrator functus officio if he has not completed the administration. In Ekanayake V Appu (1899) 3 N L R 350, it was expressed that the tendering of a final account does not make an administrator functus without a judicial settlement or a formal discharge or removal from the office. In Supramaniam Chetty V Palanniappa Chetty 3 Bal 57, an opinion was expressed that even where there has been a judicial settlement an administrator may still be sued and it may be proved that he had not duly administered the estate. Middleton J in Soysa V Abeydera 12 N L R 349,351 stated that under English Law an executor is entitled to his release from the beneficiaries under the will upon filing of proper accounts and vouchers showing a due discharge of his obligation under the will, and, so far as what can gather from a perusal of chapters XXXVIII and LIV of the Civil Procedure Code, an executor may get his discharge in Ceylon on the same grounds and for",

Once the liabilities are settled there may be situations that may cause difficulties in executing the intention of the testator in the same manner as expressed in the Will due to the insufficiency of assets or funds. Even in the case at hand, as per the document marked P5 which is relied upon by the Plaintiff Respondents as the final account in the testamentary case of Benedict de Andrado, certain liabilities of the estate of the said Benedict de Andrado had been mentioned where the monetary value of such liabilities appeared to have been exceeding the cash received by the said estate even though the total value of the assets exceeded the value of liabilities. This indicate that certain liabilities mentioned there had to be a burden on the immovable property of the said estate which included the property in issue in this case. However, insufficiency of funds had not been pleaded in defense in this case. On the other hand, the executor who tendered the said final account and who had the knowledge as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of funds was not among the defendants before the District Court case to take up such stance. It appears that the position of the Plaintiff Respondents is that the said testamentary case was terminated on this final account. However, no convincing evidence had been led by the plaintiff respondents to show why the legatees who were entitled to cash as per the Will did not intervene in the said case and prayed for suitable intervention by the court.

The journal entries of the said testamentary case had been marked as P3 at the trial. As per the Journal Entry dated 18.11.74, it appears the final account had been tendered to court by that date, and as per the journal entries dated 18.12.74 and up to the Journal entry dated 28.08.1975, it is clear that the Court did not accept the final account as it was, and had directed to tender an amended final Account in accordance with the report contained in journal entry no 42-(vide journal entries Nos. 41 to 49). At Journal Entry 50, the lawyer for the petitioner of that case (namely lawyer for the said Violet De Andrado, the Executrix) had revoked his proxy, and as per the journal Entry No.51 dated 27.10 75, it appears that the said Petitioner of that case had filed a motion and moved to do away with the need for an amended final account and to release her from her duty as the executrix and further to terminate the proceedings due to the reasons contained in the motion. Accordingly, the district court had ordered to do away with the need to file an amended final account and had terminated the proceedings. What is important is that the Plaintiff Respondents have not tendered the relevant motion at the trial before the original court. It appears that the real reasons to terminate the proceedings were contained in the said motion which was not produced in evidence. Thus, no evidence was there as to the reason for the termination of the testamentary case prior to the death of Violet de Andrado. Among the possible reasons, lawful or not, that might have contained inter alia in the motion to terminate proceedings without keeping the estate open to be administered after the death of the first executrix, there might even have been a settlement to do away with the final accounts or a submission that Abolition of Fidecommissa Act applies and the petitioner of that case had become the owner of the property or a submission that a necessary arrangements as per her averment in the said final account were made or payments were made to satisfy the payments to the legatees who were to get money after",

In such a situation the property ceased to be a part of the estate of the Benedict de Andrado due to operation of law.
