The Petitioners invoke the jurisdiction of this court alleging the infringement of Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under the Article 12(1) of the Constitution by the Respondents.

The Petitioners are members of the School Development Society of Talawakelle Tamil Maha

Vidyalaya and argues that they have a vested interest in the wellbeing of the school and the

right to education of the students. The alleged infringement is based on the failure of the 1st

and 2nd Respondents to build the new Auditorium of the school as agreed by them. The school

was relocated as the land on which previous buildings of the school was situated was acquired

for Upper Kothmale Hydro Power Project. The Respondents’ position is that the Petitioners

have no legal standing to file the present application and the Learned President’s Counsel

submits that when filing a legal action on behalf of a society by members of a society, it is

necessary to satisfy the Court by proving that they have been authorised by the respective

society to file such an action. It is further submitted that School Development Society cannot

simply file an action without passing a resolution by the members of the society at an

Executive Committee Meeting. However, The Respondents have not tendered any evidence or

authorities to substantiate the above legal context

A School Development Society consists of parents / guardians of the children of a School. It

is clear that the parents have a fair right and a duty to stand for their children if an authority

deprives the future wellbeing of the school children. In par with the said view, the legal

standing of the School Development Society of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya can be

discussed in a child rights perspective.

When considering the Sri Lanka’s legal position in protection of the rights of the child, Sri

Lanka ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on 12 July 1991. Even

though the CRC has not been directly incorporated into national law, Sri Lanka has, however,

4

expressed its view that many of the provisions of the CRC are in line with many of the current

rights espoused by the 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution (Constitution). Following the

ratification of the CRC, in 1992 Sri Lanka adopted the Children’s Charter with a view to

ensuring the standards of the Convention. CRC sets a general obligation of preserving the

interests of the child on the state authorities and the courts of law in all actions concerning

children. Article 3 (1) of the CRC declares that,

“In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private

social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or

legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary

consideration.”

Furthermore, to give effect to its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights (ICCPR), the Sri Lankan Parliament passed the ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007.

Section 5(2) of the Act states as follows:

“In all matters concerning children, whether undertaken by public or

private social welfare institutions, courts, administrative authorities, or

legislative bodies, the best interest of the child shall be of paramount

importance.” (emphasis added)

Thus, the ICCPR Act codifies the internationally recognized principle of ‘securing the

interests of the child shall be of paramount importance.’ Article 5(2) of the ICCPR Act can

be identified as a similar provision to Article 3(1) of the CRC. In accordance with the

aforesaid legal context, Sri Lanka being a state party to the CRC and adopting the Children’s

Charter with a view to ensuring that standards of the Convention and further assuring the

interests of the children by the ICCPR Act, it is noteworthy that, in the case of children who

encounter the law, among other relevant factors, it is essential for Courts to acknowledge the

interests of children to assure the protection of law the children deserve.

5

Moreover, under the Article 27(13) (directive principles of the state policy and fundamental

duties) of the Constitution, government is duty bound to promote interests of children and

youth with special care, so as to ensure their full development, physical, mental, moral,

religious and social, and to protect them from exploitation and discrimination.

Under the Article 27(2) (g) of the Constitution, Sri Lanka is pledged to raise the moral and

cultural standards and ensure the full development of human personality of people including

children. Under the Article 27(2) (h) it is further provided that Sri Lanka is obligatory to

eradicate of illiteracy and to assure all persons of the right to universal and equal access to

education at all levels. Therefore, it is apparent that this Court should emphasise the

importance of the obligation on the State to ensure ‘education’ to children as recognised by

the Constitution and international treaty obligations.

Aforementioned state obligation has been reassured in a range of case law. In the case of

Kirahandi Yeshin Nanduja De Silva and another v. Sumith Parakramawansha et al

(SC/FR 50/2015, SC minutes dated 02 August 2017) it was held that though the right to

education has not been recognized as a fundamental right in the Sri Lankan Constitution,

under the Article 27 of the Constitution, the government is obliged to take into consideration

the Directive Principles of State Policy when enacting laws and taking action regarding

governance. It was further held that it is paramount to give equal access to education in order

to establish free and just society.

Per Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J at p.8;

“Though the right to education has not been recognized as a fundamental

right in the Sri Lankan Constitution, the complete eradication of illiteracy and

the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to

education at all levels have been recognized as a directive principle in the

6

Constitution. Thus, the Government is obliged take into consideration the

Directive Principles of State Policy when enacting laws and taking action

regarding governance. In this context, I am of the view that it is paramount to

give equal access to education in order to establish a free and just society.”

In the case of Holidays (Amendment Bill) (SC/SD 6-7/2019, “Decisions of the Supreme

Court on Parliamentary Bills” 2019-2020 Vol XV 25 at 34-35) this Court has emphasized the

importance of assuring proper education and it was held that any attempt to undermine the

overall objective of Education by limiting or restricting or attaching undue prominence to text

book related or school curricular exam-orientated education, will erode the Right to

Education but also will not only defeat the rationale of Education.

In April 2003 the Principle of the school had informed the needs of the school in the context

of proposed relocation and an Auditorium was identified as one such infrastructure facility. In

this context it is noteworthy that the school concerned is an upper secondary school having

classes up to G.C.E Advanced Level in Science, Commerce and Arts streams which needs an

Auditorium for the educational purposes of the students. Accordingly, when carefully

observing the factual matrix and the aforementioned legal obligations on Sri Lanka to secure

the Right to Education, it can be noted that the Auditorium in question is important to

guarantee proper education of the school children.

Under the Article 17 of the Constitution every person is protected against the infringement

of the fundamental rights. The term used in the Constitution is ‘every person’. If there is an

infringement on rights of the children, they have the right to come before the Supreme Court

for redress. As it was discussed earlier, School Development Society who has a vested

interest on the education of the school children has a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court.

7

Under the Article 126 states that the Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive

jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent

infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right. As such, the

Supreme Court has a power to intervene in all cases concerning a violation of fundamental

rights.

When considering the protection of the interests of the children and the constitutional powers

vested upon the Supreme Court as discussed above, members of the School Development

Society of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya have a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court on the infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Article

12(1) of the Constitution on behalf of the students of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. In

the instant application the Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by way of

an application for fundamental rights as provided by the Constitution.

By February 2013, the School Development Society, Past Pupils Association with School

PSI Committee has raised concerns with the 1st Respondent on the issue of incompletion of

infrastructure facilities. It is pertinent to note that the principal (6th Respondent) is the

President of said three associations. In this communication they had drawn the attention of

the 1st Respondent on the promise to construct the Auditorium (Block-I) according to the

initial plan marked P-5. In the letter dated 05.04.2013, the Principal had conveyed the

adverse consequences that would be caused to the studies of the students if the Auditorium is

not constructed. Nevertheless, the letter of the Principal dated 17.07.2013 indicates that the

1st Respondent had failed to reply a series of communications on this matter.

The 6th Respondent –the Principal, who is also the president of the school development

society (P-12) confirmed that the three Petitioners were the Secretary and two committee

members of the school development society. School Development Society or any other

8

society who has an interest on matters relating to the school had not intervened at the initial

stages of the relocation of the school. However, when the conduct of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents became apparent that the interests of the school will be adversely affected (due

to the deviation from initial plans) School Development Society and other societies who

have an interest on the wellbeing of the school had intervened. (vide P-12 dated 2013.02.15).

Therefore, none of the three Petitioners be identified as “a mere busy body or a meddlesome

interloper” when they invoked the jurisdiction of this Court. The said legal context is

discussed in the case of Ajith P. Dharmasuriya v. Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka ( SC/

FR 330/2015, SC minutes dated 09 January 2017)

K. Sripavan, C.J. at p.5;

“The strict rule of standing which insists that only a person who had suffered a

specific legal inquiry can maintain an action for judicial redress is relaxed and

a broad rule evolved which gives standing to any member of the public who is

not a mere busy body or a meddlesome interloper but who has sufficient interest

in the proceeding. There can be no doubt that the risk of legal action against the

State or its agencies by citizen will induce the State or its agencies to act with

greater responsibility and care thereby improving the administration of

justice.”[emphasis added]

Therefore, this court has a vested responsibility to question whether there has been a

violation of fundamental rights and to make an appropriate decision on the instant issue.

When analysing the scope of ‘executive or administrative action’ under Article 126, it is

necessary to delve into the law to examine whether the actions of 1st and the 2nd Respondents

falls within executive or administrative action as referred to in said Article of the

Constitution. The term ‘executive or administrative action’ is not specifically defined in the

9

Constitution. Nevertheless, Article 4(d) of the Constitution refers to the term ‘organs of the

government’ in relation to respecting, securing and advancing the fundamental rights

guaranteed by the Constitution. This legal position is discussed in a range of case law. In the

case of Reinzie Perera v. University Grants Commission [1978-79-80] 1 Sri L.R 128 it was

held that fundamental rights operate only between individuals and the State and in the

context of fundamental rights the ‘State’ includes every repository of state power. It was

further observed that the expression ‘executive or administrative action’ embraces executive

action for the state or its agencies or instrumentalities exercising governmental functions.

A similar view had been expressed in the case of Wijethunga v. Insurance Corporation and

Another [1982] 1 Sri L.R 1 at p.6. Sharvananda A.C.J. held that the term executive action

comprehends official actions of all Government Officers.

Moreover, according to the Section 2(2) of the Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 29 of 1979,

the Ceylon Electricity Board is a body corporate having perpetual succession, which can sue

and be sued in such name. Further, when observing the provisions contained in the Act as a

whole it appears that the Minister exercises appreciable control over the Ceylon Electricity

Board in appointing members, General Manager, Chairman to the Board. In terms of Section

8 of the Act the Minister is empowered to give general and special directions to the Board.

Therefore, when considering the Constitutional provisions together with statutory provisions

and case law jurisprudence, it can be arrived at conclusion that the Petitioners can invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution in relation to the

alleged conduct of the 1st, 2nd Respondents.

The Petitioners submit that in or around 2001-2003, School Administration of Talawakelle

Tamil Maha Vidyalaya was informed by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents that due to the

Upper Kothmale Hydro power project the school needed to be relocated. Petitioner argues

10

that according to the letter dated 18.08.2004 (document marked P-5), the Respondents have

agreed to relocate the school and rebuild the facilities as listed in P-5. Further, the Petitioners

consider the document P-5 as the initial agreement to the proposed plan of the constructions.

The Petitioners contend that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have neglected or failed to

construct the Auditorium (listed in P-5 as Block-I) as agreed by the letter marked P-5 and

such conduct is arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable. The Respondents’ position is that P-5

is not an agreement, but a letter which has been addressed to the Provincial Director

(Central) Department of Education Kandy seeking his approval at the earliest to the plans

submitted pertaining to the construction of buildings.

When carefully examining the letter marked P-5, it appears that the said letter contains a

promise given by a state authority (Ceylon Electricity Board) to the School to construct the

infrastructure facilities including the Auditorium. Furthermore, it has been admitted by the

1st and 2nd Respondents in the letter marked as P-5 that “..Principle of the Talawakelle Tamil

School has verbally agreed to the new layout plan and plan of the buildings”. P-5 contains

of the layout plan of the proposed buildings and proposed dimensions of the said buildings.

It is a question of great importance before this Court whether a breach of a promise made by

a state authority can be considered as an infringement of Article 12(1). According to the

existing law a breach of a promise made by a public authority can be challenged from the

perspective of Legitimate Expectation and Public Law on the basis of an alleged

infringement of the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. This view has been adopted in a range of case law.

In the case of Wickremesinghe v. Ceylon Petrolium Corporation and Others [2001] 2 Sri.

L.R 409 S.N Silva CJ. considered whether a breach of a promise/agreement can be

challenged under the Article 12 of the Constitution and held that;

11

At p. 410

“Since the termination of the Agreement is challenged on the basis of an

infringement of the right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution, the legality of the termination has to be reviewed not in the light

of the law of contract but in the domain of the Constitutional guarantee of

equality enshrined in Article 12”

At p. 412

“..In that respect the termination of the Petitioners dealership is in compliance

with specific terms of the Agreement (PI) and the Petitioner may not be entitled

to any relief in respect of the termination under the law of contract and the

common law on the subject. But, that is from the perspective of the Private Law.

In these proceedings, the termination is challenged from the perspective of

Public Law on the basis of an alleged infringement of the fundamental right to

equality, guaranteed by Article 12(1) and (2) of the Constitution. Therefore the

matters to be considered transcend the mere examination of the terms of the

Agreement and a review of the legality of the termination in the light of the Law

of Contract and enter the domain of the constitutional guarantee of equality

enshrined in Article 12.”

A similar view was expressed in the case of Kalidasage Roshan Chaminda v. Kurunegala

Plantations Limited and Others (SC FR. Application No. 24/2013, SC minutes dated

03.09.2014). Eva Wanasundara PC. J, considered the observations of the Chief Justice S.N

Silva in Wickremesinghe v. Ceylon Petrolium Corporation and Others (supra) at p. 413;

“Therefore the impugned termination of the Dealership Agreement by P4, should

be reviewed in these proceedings not from the narrower perspective of only the

12

terms of the Agreement but from broader perspective of the exercise of executive or

administrative action by an agency of the Government and the constitutional

guarantee of equality which should guide the exercise of power under the

Agreement.”

Eva Wanasundara PC. J at P. 8-9

“I am of the opinion that the 1st Respondent’s refusal to extend the lease period

should be reviewed not from the narrow perspective of only the terms of the

agreement but from the broader perspective of the exercise of executive and

administrative action. The refusal to extend the lease period by the 1st Respondent

is an act of agency of the Government and the Constitutional guarantee of equality

should guide the exercise of power under the agreement. Every instance of

unfairness to an individual will not give rise to a justiciable grievance under the

ideology of the rule of law and equality under the law but the party which is

seemingly more powerful in this instant case, after the conclusion of signing the

contract, being a state entity should not have abused the power in its hands. The

conduct of the Respondents seem to be arbitrary even though mala fides has not

been pleaded in the petition.”[emphasis added]

Considering the above discussed case law jurisprudence, it appears that breach of the promise

refers to in the P-5 can be challenged under the Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners’ contention is that upon the assurance given in terms of the document marked

P-5, the Petitioners entertain a legitimate expectation that the School will be relocated to a

suitable location with the facilities agreed as per the said document, including the Auditorium

(Block-I). In the eyes of the law an expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is

founded upon a promise or practice by the authority that is said to be bound to fulfil the

13

expectation and the applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation should be based on

the facts and circumstances of each case. In the case of Dayaratne v. Minister of Health and

Indigenous Medicine [1999] 1 Sri L.R 393 Amarasinghe J. held that destroying of a

legitimate expectation is a ground for judicial review which amounted to a violation of equal

protection guaranteed by Article 12 of the Constitution.

A similar view was expressed in the case of Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage Nimalsiri v.

Colonel P.P.J. Fernando and Others (SC FR. Application No. 256/2010, SC minutes dated

17.09.2015) and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena PC. has further discussed the application of

the concept of legitimate expectation in the context of infringement of fundamental rights.

Priyantha Jayawardena PC. J, at p. 8-9

“In Sri Lanka the said doctrine of legitimate expectation is applied in the fields

of public law, fundamental rights law and in labour law. In labour law the said

doctrine is applicable to the state sector and the private sector in like manner.

The doctrine of legitimate expectation applies to situations to protect legitimate

expectation. It arises from establishing an expectation believing an undertaking

or promise given by a public official or establishing an expectation taking into

consideration of established practices of an authority.” [emphasis added]

At p.9

“In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation a person

should prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based on a promise or

an established practice. Thus, the applicability of the said doctrine is based on

the facts and circumstances of each case.” [emphasis added]

In light of the above legal context and the facts and circumstances of the instant application,

it is evident that the Petitioners have entertained a legitimate expectation with regard to the

14

promise made by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to relocate the school and construct all the

facilities in terms of the document marked P-5. Nevertheless, when considering the evidence

submitted by both parties, it appears that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have failed or

neglected to construct the Auditorium (Block I) as promised. The Petitioners on behalf of the

students of the School relies on the promise made by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to construct

the buildings including the Auditorium to ensure the quality and undisturbed education of the

students. The Petitioners submits that the 1st and 2nd Respondents deviated from the promise

to construct the Auditorium due to political involvement of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress

(CWC). The 1st and 2nd Respondents have stated in the letter dated 01.03.2013 (document

marked P-13) that they had to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CWC

to stop demolition of the old buildings and to agree upon sharing the Auditorium building

with the Saumaya Moorthy Thondaman Foundation.

The letter dated 01.03.2013 marked as P-13, at p.1

“..At the time of demolition of the Old Tamil School buildings, CWC

intervened to stop demolition. They demanded a building for Saumaya

Moorthy Thondaman Foundation and insisted to sign MOU with CEB before

demolition. At that stage, CEB had no option but to sign the MOU on the

advice of the Ministry of Power and Energy to continue project activities

without hindrance. However, in the MOU it was agreed to share auditorium

and library with Tamil Maha Vidayalaya.”

The Petitioners, further submits that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have acted under dictation

of a superior authority (political party or any other undisclosed party) or has abdicated their

power vested on such authority. Such conduct had resulted in depriving the School of the

new Auditorium as promised by the initial contract. In the eyes of the law, when law vests

discretionary powers in a designated authority or an official, it is the said authority who has

15

to exercise the same according to its judgement and discretion; and no one else. There is,

however, a distinction between seeking advice or assistance on the one hand and acting

under dictation on the other hand. Advice or assistance may be taken and then discretion may

be exercised by the authority concerned genuinely without blindly or mechanically acting

upon the advice.

The legal basis of which is more fully discussed by the jurist Christopher Wade in

Administrative Law, H.R.W Wade and C.F Forsyth (10th Edition at p.269- Chapter:

Surrender, Abdication and Dictation) as follows:

“Closely akin to delegation, and scarcely distinguishable from it in some

cases, is any arrangement by which a power conferred upon one authority is

in substance exercise by another. The proper authority may share its power

with someone else, or may allow someone else to dictate to it by declining to

act without their consent or by submitting to their wishes or instructions. The

effect then is that the discretion conferred by parliament is exercised, at least

in part, by the wrong authority, and the resulting decision is ultra vires and

void..” [emphasis added]

Aforesaid legal position is adopted in the case of R.P Karunarathna Bandara v. P.B

Disanayaka and Others (SC/FR Application No.356/2016, SC minutes dated 28.06.2018)

and decided that such conduct of an authority amounts to an infringement of Petitioner’s

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Per H.N.J Perera J. at p.11

“..In the instant case there is material to show that the 8th Respondent has

surrendered and abdicated her discretion to the 5th Respondent and had acted

16

under the dictates of the 5th Respondent. The 8th Respondent is prohibited

from acting under dictates of the 5th Respondent.

‘An element which is essential to the lawful exercise of power is that it should

be exercised by the authority upon whom it is conferred, and by no one else’

(vide: Chapter 10 of ‘Administrative Law’ Wade and Forsyth, 10th Edition,

page 259)”

1st and the 2nd Respondents have admitted that at the time of demolition of the old Tamil

School buildings, CWC intervened to stop demolition and they demanded a building for

Saumaya Moorthy Thondaman Foundation and insisted to sign MOU with CEB before

demolition, therefore; CEB had no option but to sign the MOU (vide document marked P-

13).

The Respondents’ position is that they had to deviate from the initial plans due to threats of

landslides. Nevertheless, for the first time the Respondents had taken up this position in

document marked P-13 dated 01 March 2013 whereas issues on the ‘auditorium’ and

intervention by Thondaman Foundation had commenced from March 2011 (document

marked P-8). It is further observed that 1st and 2nd Respondents in their statement of

objections filed in the High Court of Nuwaraeliya in HC/NE (Writ) 16/2013 on 17 December

2013 had admitted the delay in completing the school relocation but failed to take up the

specific position that an issue on landslides had either delayed or forced them to change the

initial plan (vide document marked 1R3). Furthermore, 1st and 2nd Respondents failed to

produce any material before this Court (either by way of an Affidavit, report or

correspondence from and authority who could have made such claim) to substantiate their

position.

17

Therefore, when carefully examining evidence of the present application, it appears that 1st

and the 2nd Respondents have acted under dictation or influence of a political party in

implementing the promise given to the school by CEB. Consequently, the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents have deviated from the initial promise and failed/neglected to build the

Auditorium (Block I) as promised. 2nd Respondent entering into a MOU with a third party is

a violation and disregard to the promise made to the School and this conduct is not only

unlawful but arbitrary as well.

As discussed above, Legitimate Expectation has been described as a concept which derives

from an undertaking given by someone in authority. In the instant case it is the promise

given by the Respondents to construct the Auditorium (Block-I) as laid out in the initial lay

out plan marked P-5 which establishes the Legitimate Expectation on the School including

students and the parents of the students. Due to the incompletion of the Auditorium the

students had to continue their education with limited facilities and the co-curricular activities

of the students have been paused without a proper Auditorium Building. Further the

Principle of the school had duly informed the Respondents of the need to have the required

facilities as promised in P-5 for the wellbeing of the students (vide document marked P-7).

The Petitioners complaint that the fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1)

had been violated is based on the concept of legitimate expectation as they had such an

expectation that the Respondents would construct the Auditorium building as promised in

order to continue proper education of the students of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the arbitrary decision of the Respondents to

deviate from the initial plan due to extraneous reasons including intervention by political

authority had resulted in a violation of the Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Moreover, 1st and 2nd Respondents have raised the issue of time bar regarding the

Petitioners’ application. This application had been filed on 11 April 2014. Although a

18

possible deviation from the initial plan (P-5) promised by the Respondents had been surfaced

for the first time in 2011, parties had been on constant discussions on the possible options.

Even on July 2013, the Respondents had sought the intervention of Secretary Ministry of

Power and Energy. Thereafter, 1st and 2nd Respondents in their statement of objections filed

in the High Court of Nuwaraeliya in HC/NE (Writ) 16/2013 on 17 December 2013 had

admitted the delay in completing the school relocation. However, the Respondents did not

claim the relocation process is completed (vide 1R3).

Therefore, the alleged violation due to non-compliance with the initial agreement had been a

continuing violation and it was only on 16 October 2014 (six months after the filing of the

present application), the 1st Respondent had handed over the newly constructed buildings to

the Divisional Secretary who in turn handed over it to the Provincial Director of Education

(vide document marked 1R1).Hence there is no merit in submission of the Respondents

that this application is out of time.

As per the legal context discussed above, 1st and the 2nd Respondents as public authorities

had no reason to deviate from the initial promise with the School by handing over the

discretion to a political party or any other undisclosed authority. Further, 1st and 2nd

Respondents are bound by the Contractual obligation to build all the buildings including the

Auditorium (Block-I) as promised to ensure the undisturbed education of the students.

Therefore, by concluding the Judgement, this Court declares that, the Fundamental Rights

guaranteed to the Petitioner under the Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been infringed

by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents by not building the Auditorium (Block I) as set out in the

document marked P-5.

Thus, this Court directs the 2nd Respondent to construct an Auditorium for Thalawakele

Tamil Maha Vidyalaya in a suitable location according to specifications promised in P-5, in

19

consultation with all stake holders including 4th, 5th, and 6th Respondents and School

Development Society of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. I further order the 1st

Respondent to pay Rs. 25000/= as costs to each of the three Petitioners.
