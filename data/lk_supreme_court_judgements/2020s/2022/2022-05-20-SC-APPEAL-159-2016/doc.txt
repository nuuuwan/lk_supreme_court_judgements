SC/APPEAL/159/2016

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court seeking

ejectment of the defendant from the premises in suit and damages

on the basis that the defendant is in unlawful possession of the

premises, the leave and license given to him by the plaintiff having

been terminated by P4 effective from 31.01.1994. The defendant

sought dismissal of the plaintiff’s action on the basis that the

plaintiff was the defendant’s licensee whereas he (the defendant)

was the tenant of the owner of the premises, namely Thillairajah.

The fact that Thillairajah was the owner of the premises is

undisputed. After trial, the District Court held with the defendant

and dismissed the plaintiff’s action. On appeal by the plaintiff, the

Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the District Court and

entered judgment for the plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the

defendant to this Court.

This Court granted leave to appeal to the defendant on three

questions of law, which are, verbatim, as follows:

(a) Has the Court of Appeal erred in not considering that the

leave and license alleged to have been granted to the

defendant by the plaintiff has not been established?

(b) Has the Court of Appeal erred in not considering the fact

that the defendant had been possessing the property in

dispute long before November 1990, the month in which the

plaintiff alleged to have given leave and license to the

defendant which fact clearly establishes that the defendant

had not entered into the premises on the leave and license

of the plaintiff?

(c) Has the Court of Appeal erred in stressing that the

defendant has failed to prove tenancy with V. Thillairajah

6

SC/APPEAL/159/2016

despite the fact that the fundamental issue of the case was

whether the defendant came to the premises on the leave

and license of the plaintiff?

The first and second questions relate to the burden of proof and

the third to the onus of proof.

Although the defendant’s case, as crystallised in the issues raised

before the District Court, was that he was the tenant of

Thillairajah, he admitted in evidence that he did not have any

receipts issued by Thillairajah acknowledging payment of rent. He

also admitted that there was not a single correspondence between

him and Thillairajah. Conversely, the plaintiff marked several

letters exchanged between him and Thillairajah manifesting the

relationship between them as landlord and tenant. In one of those

letters, namely P16 dated 20.07.1985, Thillairajah inter alia says

“I am the owner of the shop and that you are my tenant ever since

you got into occupation and you have been paying me the rent so

long for several years.”

Moreover, as evidenced by P1 dated 16.11.1992, the defendant

deposited rent in respect of the premises for November 1992 in

the Colombo Municipal Council in the name of the plaintiff stating

that the plaintiff was his landlord. The Colombo Municipal

Council transmitted the rent by way of a Money Order to the

plaintiff in terms of section 21 of the Rent Act. Immediately

thereafter, the plaintiff by P2 informed the Colombo Municipal

Council that he is not prepared to accept the rent for the reasons

stated therein.

It is significant to note that none of those documents tendered in

evidence was marked “subject to proof”. Further, the plaintiff was

7

SC/APPEAL/159/2016

never cross-examined on P1. The defendant’s vague and belated

attempt to disown P1 in his evidence shall be rejected as an

afterthought. The contention of the defendant that P1 was not

proved is unsustainable. A party cannot make a complaint to the

Trial Court or the Appellate Court that a document has not been

proved when he remained silent at the time of the document being

marked in evidence: section 154(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

There is no necessity to refer to all the documents marked by the

plaintiff in evidence. P16 and P1 respectively are in my view more

than sufficient to prove that the plaintiff, not the defendant, is the

tenant of Thillairajah and the defendant is in occupation of the

premises under the plaintiff.

One of the main issues raised by the defendant in the District

Court was that when Thillairajah was admittedly the owner of the

premises, the plaintiff could not have given leave and license to

the defendant to occupy the premises. Although this issue had

been answered in favour of the defendant by the District Court,

the Court of Appeal rightly reversed that finding. The plaintiff

need not be the owner of the premises to give leave and license to

the defendant to occupy the premises. A licensee can become a

licensor if he permits a third party to occupy the premises. Once

the license of the latter is later terminated, he must vacate the

premises. He is estopped from challenging or questioning the

authority of the licensor to grant him leave and license: section

116 of the Evidence Ordinance. (Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne

[1997] 1 Sri LR 197, Wimala Perera v. Kalyani Sriyalatha [2011] 1

Sri LR 182, Ahamed Saheed v. Abdul Hameed,

SC/APPEAL/4/2013, SC Minutes of 23.05.2018)

8

SC/APPEAL/159/2016

By the third question of law, the defendant argues that the Court

of Appeal misapplied the onus of proof, in that the Court was more

concerned about the defendant’s claim that he was the tenant of

Thillairajah when the real issue to be decided was whether the

defendant was the licensee of the plaintiff. I am afraid I cannot

agree with this line of argument. The Court of Appeal addressed

its mind to the real issue, i.e. whether the defendant was the

licensee of the plaintiff. In resolving that issue, the Court of

Appeal also rightly considered the matter put in issue by the

defendant himself in the District Court, i.e. whether he (the

defendant) was the tenant of Thillairajah. This is not shifting the

burden of proof to the defendant.

This is not a criminal case where the accused is entitled to remain

silent allowing the prosecution to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt. This is a civil case where the plaintiff shall

prove his case on a balance or preponderance of probabilities.

This means the plaintiff in a civil case should prove that his

version is more probable or more likely than that of the defendant.

In a civil case as much as in a criminal case the defendant can

remain silent, as the overall burden lies with the plaintiff. If he

remains silent, the Court can inter alia draw a presumption

against him: illustration (f) of section 114 of the Evidence

Ordinance. If the defendant elects to give evidence and/or lead

evidence on his behalf, the Court is entitled to consider such

evidence to decide whether the plaintiff proved his case. If that is

not permissible, there is no purpose in allowing the defendant to

lead evidence in a civil case.
