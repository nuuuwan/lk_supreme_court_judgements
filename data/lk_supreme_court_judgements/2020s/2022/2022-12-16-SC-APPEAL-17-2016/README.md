Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District Court of

Colombo on 04.03.2004 seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in the second schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom,

and damages. The defendant by answer dated 09.07.2004 sought

dismissal of the plaintiff’s action.

Before issues were raised, the plaintiff passed away on 12.04.2006 and

the registered Attorney of the plaintiff made an application under section

404 of the Civil Procedure Code by way of petition and affidavit dated

27.09.2006 seeking to substitute one Arumugam Rasalingam as the

substituted plaintiff, on the basis that the deceased plaintiff during the

pendency of the action had transferred his rights in relation to the land in

suit by deed No. 4906 dated 16.09.2005. With this application, a copy of

4

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

the Death Certificate and deed No. 4906 were tendered marked X1 and X2

respectively.

The defendant filed objections to this application by petition and affidavit

dated 28.02.2007 and the matter was fixed for inquiry, which was

disposed of by way of written submissions. The defendant resisted this

application on two grounds: (a) the signature of the deceased plaintiff

appearing on the deed is different from his signature appearing on other

documents; (b) if the deed was executed on 16.09.2005, the application

could have been made when the deceased plaintiff was alive. It was quite

clear that the defendant objected to the application for substitution made

under section 404 on the basis that the deed is a forgery and not on any

other ground. The District Court having considered the objections and the

written submissions tendered by both parties, made order dated

27.06.2007 allowing the application for substitution. The amended

caption was accordingly tendered. There was no appeal against the order.

Learned counsel for the defendant does not say even now that the order

dated 27.06.2007 is erroneous.

On 13.02.2008, admissions and issues were recorded before the District

Court. On 07.07.2008, the substituted plaintiff gave evidence-in-chief.

Thereafter, on 15.09.2008, during the course of cross-examination of the

substituted plaintiff, learned counsel for the defendant raised the following

two issues: (a) Did the original plaintiff transfer his rights in the land by

deed marked X2 (also marked V3) pending determination of the action?

(b) If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, can the plaintiff

maintain this action?

The District Court by order dated 09.01.2009 citing Ponnamma v.

Weerasuriya (1908) 11 NLR 217, Silva v. Jayawardena (1942) 43 NLR 551

and Eugin Fernando v. Charles Perera and Others [1988] 2 Sri LR 288,

answered these two issues against the substituted plaintiff and dismissed

5

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

the action on the basis that in a rei vindicatio action such as this it is

necessary for the title to be present with the plaintiff not only at the

beginning of the action but until the conclusion of the case.

Of these judgments relied upon by the learned District Judge, let me say

the following: the first judgment does not express such a view; the second

judgment does; the third judgment takes the contrary view.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed the order of the District

Court and dismissed the appeal. Hence this appeal by the substituted

plaintiff.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court

of Civil Appeal on the following questions of law:

a) Was the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the District

Court action, based on an erroneous construction of the law?

b) Did the Hon. High Court Judges and the learned District Judge err in

holding that the action of the substituted plaintiff-appellant-petitioner

in the District Court cannot be proceeded with since the original

plaintiff had parted with his title in the land?

c) Did the Hon. High Court Judges and the learned District Judge fail to

consider that the title in the land had passed from the original plaintiff

not to a person who was not a party in the case, but to the substituted

plaintiff-appellant-petitioner?

d) Did the Hon. High Court Judges err when they held that the plaintiff

has lost his title pending the conclusion of the action, without

considering that the title had in fact passed to the substituted

plaintiff-appellant-petitioner who had been substituted as the plaintiff

in the action by the District Court?

6

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

e) Did the Hon. High Court Judges and the learned District Judge err

when they held that the plaintiff must retain title throughout the

course of the action?

f) Did the Hon. High Court Judges and the learned District Judge fail to

appreciate that the respondent did not challenge the order of the

learned District Judge dated 27.06.2007 allowing the substituted

plaintiff-appellant-petitioner to be substituted as the substituted

plaintiff?

The preliminary question to be considered is, once an order is made by

the Court on a certain matter after giving a hearing to both parties, can

the same matter be reagitated by one of the parties, either directly or

indirectly, at a subsequent stage of the proceedings before the same Court

without preferring an appeal against the previous order? In my judgment,

this cannot be done on first principles. As much as a plaintiff cannot

present his claim in Court piecemeal (vide section 34 of the Civil Procedure

Code), a defendant also cannot take up his defence piecemeal. The

defendant shall take up at once all matters which existed at the time of

pronouncement of the order and which he had an opportunity of bringing

before the Court, for otherwise there will be no end to litigation. Cf. Banda

v. Karohamy (1948) 50 NLR 369. As Sansoni C.J. remarked in Cassim v.

Government Agent, Batticaloa (1966) 69 NLR 403 at 404 “there must be

finality in litigation, even if incorrect orders have to go unreversed.” In such

circumstances, the defendant cannot later add another string to his bow

and say that the plaintiff’s vindicatory action must fail because of the

execution of the deed (produced with the application under section 404

for substitution) pending the determination of the action. If the defendant

wanted to take up that position, it should have been the first objection

against substitution (rather than the deed being a forgery), which, if

convincing, could have resulted in the dismissal of the action. The

defendant did not do so. Hence the defendant could not have reagitated

7

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

the matter halfway through the trial. The order of the District Court dated

09.01.2009 is a nullity as it was made corum non judice.

The next question is whether the Roman Dutch Law principle articulated

by legendary Dutch jurist Voet (1647-1713) as quoted by Keuneman J. in

Silva v. Jayawardena (1942) 43 NLR 551 (Voet 6:1:4 – Voet’s Title on

Vindications and interdicta by Casie Chitty) and reproduced below should

be mechanically followed in view of the provisions of the Civil Procedure

Code.

But again, if he who brought this action was the dominus at the time

of the institution of the suit, but lite pendente has lost the dominium,

reason dictates that the defendant should be absolved…both because

the suit has then fallen into that case, from which an action could not

have a beginning, and in which it could not continue...and because

the interest of the plaintiff in the subject of the suit has ceased to

exist,…and in short because that (right of dominium) has been

removed and become extinct, which was the only foundation of this

real action.

According to this proposition of law, in an action rei vindicatio, if the

plaintiff loses title to the land pendente lite, the action fails. This Roman

Dutch Law principle is given recognition to in cases such as Eliashamy v.

Punchi Banda (1911) 14 NLR 113, Fernando v. Appuhamy (1921) 23 NLR

476, De Silva v. Goonetileke (1931) 32 NLR 217, Silva v. Jayawardene

(1942) 43 NLR 551, Oman Ekanayake and Others v. Ratranhamy [2012]

BLR 19.

At first glance, this proposition of law gives rise to two concerns. Firstly,

this ignores another well-settled principle in law, i.e. that the rights of the

parties shall be decided at the time of the institution of the action.

8

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

Secondly, this ignores the aspect of the continuation of an action after

alteration of the status of parties by addition and/or substitution.

Chapter 25 of the Civil Procedure Code containing sections 392-405

provides for the continuation of actions after alteration of a party’s status

by death, marriage and bankruptcy etc. Section 404 is a residuary section

governing cases not specifically provided for in those sections. Section 404

reads as follows:

In other cases of assignment, creation, or devolution of any interest

pending the action, the action may, with the leave of the court, given

either with the consent of all parties or after service of notice in writing

upon them, and hearing their objections, if any, be continued by or

against the person to whom such interest has come, either in addition

to or in substitution for the person from whom it has passed, as the

case may require.

Section 404 is a standalone section with little qualification and with

considerable latitude being afforded to the Court to decide on the matter

of addition or substitution on the unique facts and circumstances of each

application. Although section 392 enacts that the death of a plaintiff or

defendant shall not cause the action to abate “if the right to sue on the

cause of action survives”, section 404 presents no such qualification. Vide

Dhammananda Thero v. Saddananda Thero (1977) 79(1) NLR 289 at 302.

Except in the dissenting judgment of Grenier J. in Eliashamy’s case

(supra) where there is a passing reference to section 404 of the Civil

Procedure Code, the Court has not made even a passing reference to

section 404 in any of the other cases referred to above but has solely

depended upon the aforesaid passage of Voet. Grenier J. at page 121

merely states “I do not think that either section 18 or section 404 is helpful

to the plaintiff in the position in which he has placed himself by conveying

9

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

the property in question to third parties, for no declaration of title can be

made in this action in favour of the purchasers so long as the plaintiff is on

the record.” It may be relevant to note that in the instant action the original

plaintiff is not on record; he passed away and, after inquiry, the

substituted plaintiff was appointed in his place.

In Eugin Fernando v. Charles Perera and Others [1988] 2 Sri LR 228,

Goonewardene J. did not agree with the above observation of Grenier J.

Whilst stating that it is obiter, Goonewardene J. held that section 404 of

the Civil Procedure Code makes express provision for such a course of

action and further stated that the same view has been taken in cases such

as Murugesu v. Gunaratne (CA/LA/29/79, CA Minutes of 18.07.1979) and

Kandasamy v. Meenambikai (CA/LA/17/79, CA Minutes of 22.08.1979).

Pless Pol v. De Soysa (1907) 10 NLR 252 was not a rei vindicatio action.

Nevertheless, the pronouncement of Hutchinson C.J. in that case is

instructive. The plaintiff had filed action against the defendant seeking

damages on an agreement. After the answer was filed, the plaintiff, by way

of a deed sold and assigned all his interest in the agreement and in the

action to another; the latter then sold and assigned the same to the

appellant. The application by the appellant to be added as a party to the

action was refused by the District Court relying on a statement of the

Roman Dutch Law to that effect contained in Nathan’s Common Law of

South Africa, Vol. II, page 735. On appeal, the respondents citing eminent

Roman Dutch Law jurists contended that under the Roman Dutch Law a

right of action cannot be assigned after litis contestatio (which, in Ceylon,

according to Hutchinson C.J., means the settlement of issues in the

action), and therefore there was no assignment to which section 404 could

apply. Rejecting this contention, Hutchinson C.J. stated at pages 253-254:

On these authorities it does not seem to me quite clear that the Roman

Dutch Law forbids such an assignment. But if it did, I think it cannot

10

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

have been intended to make the transaction altogether illegal and

void as between the parties to it, but that the rule was only a rule of

procedure, and that section 404 over-rides it. That section gives the

Court power to allow the assignee to be added as a party when the

assignment was made at any time pending the action; and the Court

ought to do so in a proper case when it appears convenient and

possible without prejudice to the other party.

This finding of the Supreme Court was affirmed by the Privy Council in

Pless Pol v. Lady De Soysa (1911) 15 NLR 57.

There is no rationale for the proposition of law that in a vindicatory suit,

the action must fail the moment the plaintiff transfers title pending action

(except to say that it is a principle of the Roman Dutch Law as articulated

by Voet) when section 404 of the Civil Procedure Code expressly enacts

that in the case of assignment, creation or devolution of any interest in

the subject matter of a pending action, the Court has the discretion to

admit parties as plaintiffs or defendants after affording a hearing to all

parties to the action. It is up to the Court to exercise that discretion

judicially taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each

individual case. Vide Daniel Silva v. Jayasekere (1945) 46 NLR 316, Paaris

and Another v. Bridget Fernando [1992] 1 Sri LR 36, Perera v. Ramaiah

[1997] 1 Sri LR 225, Cinemas Ltd v. Soundarajan [1998] 2 Sri LR 16,

Seneviratne v. Fernando [2001] 3 Sri LR 72.

I am not inclined to accept the argument of learned counsel for the

defendant that section 404 deals with the procedural law, which has not

changed the substantive law. Insofar as the instant matter is concerned,

the procedural law and the substantive law cannot be separated; they are

interwoven. What is the point in making the appellant the substituted

plaintiff under section 404 to continue with the action, if the Court is to

inform him at the end of a protracted trial that the action is dismissed

11

SC/APPEAL/17/2016

without going into the merits on the Roman Dutch Law principle

enunciated by Voet quoted above? The express provision in section 404

of the Civil Procedure Code can appropriately be made use of in making

applications for addition or substitution of parties in a vindicatory action

as well, when assignment, creation or devolution of any interest in the

subject matter is effected pending determination of the action. If the

substitution/addition is allowed, the Court is entitled to look into the

merits of the claim of the added or substituted party, as appropriate.

Cases must be decided on the merits, not on technicalities (unless the

technicality goes to the root of the case). The law is not static but, rather,

dynamic and should cater to the needs and challenges of contemporary

society.

Issue No. 17 raised in the District Court shall be answered in the

affirmative and issue No. 18 as “Action can be maintained.” I answer the

questions of law accepted by this Court in the affirmative.

The order of the District Court dated 09.01.2009 and the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal dated 17.06.2014 are set aside and appeal is

allowed but without costs.

The trial will continue from the place it was abruptly stopped. In view of

this decision, the parties are permitted to raise additional issues, if

necessary. The substituted plaintiff inter alia shall prove due execution of

the deed V3.
