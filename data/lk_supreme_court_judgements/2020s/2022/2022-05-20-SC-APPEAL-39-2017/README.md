The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondents (Plaintiffs) filed this action

against the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (Defendant) in the

District Court of Colombo seeking as the substantive relief a

declaration that the Plaintiffs, their agents, customers and

suppliers are entitled to use the right of way described in the

second schedule to the plaint to enter the land described in the

first schedule to the plaint. Pending determination of the action,

3

SC/APPEAL/39/2017

the Plaintiffs also sought an interim injunction preventing the

Defendant from disturbing the Plaintiffs use of the said right of

way. The District Court refused the interim injunction and, on

appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal granted it. The Defendant

has now come before this Court against the Judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeal.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the Judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal on three questions of law. The first

question is whether the High Court erred in law in granting the

interim injunction. The second and third questions (i.e. whether

the Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case and whether the

balance of convenience lies with the Defendant) are encapsulated

in the first question.

In my view, the High Court erred in granting the interim

injunction which allows the Plaintiffs, their agents, customers

and suppliers to use the 20-foot-wide road depicted as Lot 7 in

Plan No. 1095 (D2) to enter the land described in the first

schedule to the plaint. This I say on first principles. Let me

explain.

It is clear that the disputed right of way (Lot 7 in Plan No. 1095)

is a private road in extent of 23.1 perches starting from

Dharmapala Mawatha; but, unfortunately, this is not the right of

way described in the second schedule to the plaint. The second

schedule refers to a portion of land in extent of 0.1 of a perch lying

outside the disputed right of way.

The land described in the first schedule to the plaint is Lot X1 in

Plan No. 2363 (P3), which is bounded on the North by premises

bearing assessment No. 460 on Union Place (belonging to the

4

SC/APPEAL/39/2017

Plaintiffs); East by premises bearing No. 251/11 on Union Place;

South by Lot Y1 of the same Plan; and West by the remaining

portion of Lot X. The extent of Lot X1 is 1 perch.

The land described in the second schedule to the plaint is Lot Y1

in Plan No. 2363, which is bounded on the North and East by Lot

X1 of the said Plan (referred to in the first schedule to the plaint);

South by a private road (the private road in dispute); and West by

Lot Y. The extent of Lot YI is 0.1 of a perch.

In short, although the disputed right of way is Lot 7, neither the

schedules to the plaint nor the substantive relief sought by the

plaintiff refer to Lot 7.

The issuance of interim injunctions by our Courts is mainly

regulated by section 54 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, as

amended, and sections 662-667 in Chapter 48 of the Civil

Procedure Code. The former deals with jurisdiction and the latter

with procedure.

In an interim injunction application, the Plaintiff shall

demonstrate that the act of the Defendant is in violation of the

Plaintiffs legal rights in respect of the subject matter of the action

and would tend to render the Judgment nugatory in the event of

the Plaintiffs success in the suit. An interim injunction has no

independent survival. It is dependent upon the substantive relief

sought. The interim injunction is issued to protect the substantive

relief and ceases to exist with the entering of the Judgment. A

necessary corollary of this is that a party cannot by way of an

interim injunction ask for more than what he has asked for as

substantive relief. No Court has jurisdiction to grant interim relief

incapable of being accommodated in the final relief. (Mallika De

5

SC/APPEAL/39/2017

Silva v. Gamini De Silva [1999] 1 Sri LR 85, Haji Omar v.

Wickremasinghe [1999] 1 Sri LR 82) As the plaintiffs action is

presently constituted, the interim relief granted cannot be

preserved in the final judgment.

The application for interim injunction is misconceived in fact and

law. There is no necessity to go into the finer details of the matter.

Although the District Court refused the interim injunction on

different grounds, I agree with the conclusion of the learned

District Judge. I set aside the Judgment of the High Court of Civil

Appeal. The substituted Defendant-Respondent-Appellants are

entitled to costs in all three Courts.
