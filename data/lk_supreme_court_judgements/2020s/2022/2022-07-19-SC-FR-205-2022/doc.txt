ORDER OF COURT

The Petitioner is seeking to impugn the election of the 9th and 10th Respondents as

Members of Parliament from the National Lists of the United National Party and the Sri

Lanka Pudujana Peramuna respectively.

The application was filed on 16th June 2022. It was referred to the Listing Judge on 20th

June 2022 who made an order on the same day directing to issue notice on the

Respondents and to list the application for support on 6th July 2022.

It appears that the Registry of the Supreme Court had thereafter sent the notice to the

Hon. Attorney-General, the 11th Respondent, on 22nd June 2022 by hand. On the same

day, a journal entry had been made by the Registry that the Attorney-at-Law has not

tendered notice up to date in terms of the order dated 20th June 2022.

In fact, the Petitioner had failed to comply with the direction dated 20th June 2022 even

by the time the application was taken up for support on 6th July 2022. The journal entry

reflects that on that day, the Petitioner had informed Court that he had filed a motion

requesting His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice to nominate a Special Bench for this application.

The Court having observed that the said motion was not in the brief, directed this matter

to be mentioned on 15th July 2022 to ascertain whether His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice

has made an order with regard to the request made by the Petitioner to have a Special

Bench nominated to hear this matter.

His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice had made order on 12th July 2022 refusing the application

of the Petitioner to constitute a Special Bench and recorded his reasons for the refusal.

He further directed that this matter be listed for support on urgent basis on 14th July 2022

before any Bench with notice to the Hon. Attorney-General and Other Respondents.

Page 4 of 11

Thus, by 12th July 2022, there were two orders made, one by the Listing Judge on 20th June

2022 and the other by His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice on 12th July 2022, directing that, in

addition to the Hon. Attorney-General, notice be served on all the other Respondents.

Nonetheless, the Petitioner had failed to comply with these orders.

Notwithstanding the lack of due diligence shown by the Petitioner in failing to tender the

required notices, it appears that the Supreme Court Registry had on 12th July 2022 acting

pursuant to the order of His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice, prepared notices to be sent to all

the Respondents. However, there is no journal entry to indicate that they were in fact

dispatched.

The Hon. Attorney-General was the only party represented when the matter was taken

up for support on 14th July 2022 as directed by His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice. Court was

mindful of the fact that, specially in the circumstances of this case where the Petitioner is

seeking interim relief staying the 9th and 10th Respondents from occupying office as duly

‘elected’ Members of Parliament under Article 99A and sitting and voting in the

Parliament and/or in the office of the Cabinet of Ministers, it was incumbent on the

Petitioner to serve notice on the 9th and 10th Respondents before seeking interim relief

from Court.

In Ittepana v. Hemawathie [(1981) 1 Sri.L.R. 476 at 483] Sharvananda J. (as he was then)

quoted with approval the following extract from Black on Judgments:

“Jurisdiction naturally divides itself into three heads. In order to the validity of a

judgment, the Court must have jurisdiction of the persons, of the subject matter

and of the particular question which it assumes to decide. It cannot act upon

persons who are not legally before it, upon one who is not a party to the suit ...,

upon a defendant who has never been notified of the proceedings. If the Court has

no jurisdiction, it is of no consequence that the proceedings had been formally

conducted, for they are coram non judice. A judgment entered by such Court is void

and a mere nullity." [Emphasis added]

Page 5 of 11

The fundamental rights jurisdiction of Court includes the power to make interim orders

[Jayanetti v. Land Reform Commission and Others [(1984) 2 Sri.L.R. 172 at 180]. No

doubt there may be instances where the Court, in exercising its jurisdiction in terms of

Article 126(4) of the Constitution, may have to grant interim relief without hearing the

party affected in the first instance in the interest of justice. Nonetheless, this is not such

a case as the failure to serve notices on the 9th and 10th Respondents prior to supporting

for interim relief occurred due to the lack of diligence shown by the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, on 14th July 2022 Court directed the Registrar to take steps to

serve notices on the 1st to 10th Respondents. On that date the Petitioner moved that this

matter be taken up on an urgent basis and requested that it be listed for support on 18th

July 2022. However, Court pointed out that there must be sufficient time given for notice

to be served on the 9th and 10th Respondents and for them to obtain legal representation

and offered to list the matter for support on 20th or 21st of July. However, the Petitioner

informed that he was due to proceed to UK for the graduation of his daughter and hence

those two days were not suitable. He further informed that he was due to return to Sri

Lanka only on 20th August 2022. Accordingly, Court fixed this matter for support on 29th

August 2022.

However, the Petitioner filed a motion on the very next day, 15th July 2022, claiming that

the visa interview scheduled for 14th July 2022 was cancelled due to the imposition of

curfew by the Government and therefore the Petitioner’s visit to UK has become

uncertain. He moved that this matter be fixed for support of interim relief on 18th July

2022 and informed Court that he had taken steps to serve notices on the 9th, 10th and 11th

Respondents by courier service. The Listing Judge had directed that this motion be

supported on 18th July 2022.

On that day, only the 9th and 11th Respondents were represented. The learned President’s

Counsel for the 9th Respondent informed Court that his client had not been served with

notice but had become aware of the proceedings and obtained a copy of the petition from

the Attorney-General’s department.

Page 6 of 11

In view of the facts pleaded by the Petitioner in his motion dated 15th July 2022, Court

made inquiries from the Petitioner about his proposed travel to UK and its subsequent

cancellation as alleged by him as the Court was concerned about the veracity of the

position outlined to Court by the Petitioner about his proposed travel to the UK. The

Petitioner informed that he became aware of the cancellation of the visa interview only

on 15th July 2022 after appearing in this case on 14th July 2022, and on his own volition

produced his telephone to Court and drew attention to two notices received regarding

the visa interview. These two notices were subsequently filed by motion by the Petitioner

as directed by Court.

We observed that there was one e-mail informing of the closure of the Visa Application

Centre on 14th July 2022. However, that email had been received by the Petitioner on 13th

July 2022 at 6.22 p.m. Thus, it became clear that contrary to his intimation to Court, the

Petitioner was aware by the time he appeared before Court on 14th July 2022 that his visa

interview scheduled for 14th July was cancelled [Vide documents marked EM1 and EM2

annexed to the motion dated 18th July 2022]. His statement to Court on 14th July of his

impending travel to the UK on 20th July 2022 appears to have been an attempt to obtain

an early date to support this matter by misrepresenting facts. We wish to place on record

that such conduct is unbecoming of any counsel and a breach of his professional

obligations to Court.

Nonetheless, we permitted the Petitioner to support his application against the 9th

Respondent but made it clear that we are not inclined to make any order against the 10th

Respondent who was not represented before Court.

Both the learned DSG and the learned President’s Counsel for the 9th Respondent raised

a preliminary objection that the application of the Petitioner is time barred.

In terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, a fundamental rights application must be

filed within one month of the infringement of the fundamental right.

Page 7 of 11

In Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and Others [(1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 384 at 402] Fernando J. held:

“Three principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time limit

prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the infringement takes place;

if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other instances by

comparison with which the treatment meted out to him becomes discriminatory),

time begins to run only when both infringement and knowledge exist (Siriwardena

v. Rodrigo). The pursuit of other remedies, judicial or administrative, does not

prevent or interrupt the operation of the time limit. While the time limit is

mandatory, in exceptional cases on the application of the principle lex non cogit ad

impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay on the part of the petitioner, this

Court has a discretion to entertain an application made out of time.”

According to the petition, the election of the 9th Respondent as a Member of Parliament

was published in the gazette on 18th June 2021. This application was filed on 16th June

2022 nearly one year after the 9th Respondent was declared elected as a Member of

Parliament. Hence the application of the Petitioner is out of time and is liable to be

dismissed in limine.

However, the Petitioner contended that the violation is of a continuing nature. In

response, the learned President Counsel for the 9th Respondent pointed out that there is

no averment in the petition that the alleged infringement is a continuing violation.

Moreover, the learned DSG submitted that the question of a continuing violation does not

arise as the Petitioner had previously challenged the election of the 9th Respondent as a

Member of Parliament in S.C. (F/R) Application No. 200/2021.

The Petitioner has, at paragraph 9 of the petition, disclosed that he had challenged the

election of the 9th Respondent as a Member of Parliament in S.C. (F/R) Application No.

200/2021. However, he claims, at paragraphs 11 and 21 of the petition, that the said

application was never allowed to be supported.

Page 8 of 11

We examined the case record of S.C. (F/R) Application No. 200/2021 and found that on

14th October 2021, the application was dismissed as the Petitioner was absent and

unrepresented. Hence it is clear that the Petitioner had suppressed and misrepresented

to Court the fact that S.C. (F/R) Application No. 200/2021 had been dismissed. It is

incumbent on a Petitioner in a fundamental rights application to show uberrima fides and

disclose to all material facts to Court. Failure to do so makes the application liable to be

dismissed in limine.

In Jayasinghe v. The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (NIFNE) and

Others [(2002) 1 Sri.L.R. 277 at 286] Yapa J. held:

“Any party who misleads Court, misrepresents facts to Court or utters falsehood in

Court will not be entitled to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established

proposition of law, since Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank and open

with the Court. This principle has been applied even in an application that has been

made to challenge a decision made without jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go

into the merits of the case in such situations.”

The Petitioner responded that he had disclosed to Court by X5 appended to the pleadings

that S.C. (F/R) Application No. 200/2021 had been dismissed. X5 is a motion filed in that

case. However, the mere attachment of that motion to this application is insufficient given

the fact that the Petitioner had specifically pleaded at paragraphs 11 and 21 of the

petition, that the said application was never allowed to be supported. The dexterity of the

Petitioner, where he makes a misstatement of a material fact in the body of the petition

but the true state of facts is camouflaged in an appending document to the petition, does

not provide an avenue for him to claim that all material facts have been disclosed to Court.

Accordingly, the application of the Petitioner is liable to be dismissed for the Petitioner

had suppressed from Court the material fact that S.C. (F/R) Application No. 200/2021 had

been dismissed.

The crux of the case of the Petitioner against the 9th Respondent is Article 99A of the

Constitution. He submitted that in terms of Article 99A, it was incumbent on the Secretary

of the United National Party to nominate a person to fill the one seat obtained by the

party on the National List at the General Elections 2020 within one week of the intimation

made by the Election Commission by X2 dated 7th August 2020. This was not done. It was

the contention of the Petitioner that due to such failure of the United National Party, the

appointment of the 9th Respondent as a Member of Parliament under Article 99A of the

Constitution is ab initio void and has no force in law.

The relevant part of Article 99A of the Constitution reads:

“Where a recognized political party or independent group is entitled to a seat under

the apportionment referred to above, the Election Commission shall by a notice,

require the secretary of such recognized political party or group leader of such

independent group to nominate within one week of such notice, persons qualified to

be elected as Members of Parliament (being persons whose names are included in the

list submitted to the Election Commission under this Article or in any nomination paper

submitted in respect of any electoral district by such party or group at that election) to

fill such seats and shall declare elected as Members of Parliament, the persons so

nominated.”

The Petitioner conceded that the 9th Respondent is qualified in terms of this provision as

his name appeared in the nomination paper of the United National Party for the Colombo

District. The challenge to his election was limited to the failure to comply with the one-

week time limit.

At the outset we observe that neither Article 99A nor any other provision of the

Constitution sets out the consequences on the failure of a recognized political party or

independent group to nominate a qualified person for National List seats obtained by such

party or group within one week of the intimation by the Election Commission.

Samarakoon C.J. in Visuvalingam and Others v. Liyanage and Others (No. 1) [(1983) 1

Sri.L.R. 203 at 214-215] held:

“For the purpose of deciding whether a provision in a constitution is mandatory one

must have regard also to the aims, scope and object of the provision. The mere use

of the word "shall" does not necessarily make the provision mandatory. Subba

Rao,J. in the case of State of U.P. vs. Babu Ram stated the position thus-"When a

statute used the word 'shall', prima facie , it is mandatory , but the Court may

ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole

scope of the statute. For ascertaining the real intention of the Legislature the Court

may consider, inter alia, the nature and the design of the statute, and the

consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other, the

impact of other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions

in question is avoided, the circumstance, namely, that the statute provides for a

contingency of the non-compliance with the provisions, the fact that the non-

compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty, the serious or

trivial consequences that flow therefrom, and, above all, whether the object of the

legislation will be defeated or furthered."

In terms of Article 3 of the Constitution, franchise forms part of the Sovereignty of the

People. The National Seat that the United National Party obtained is a direct result of the

exercise of the franchise by the people. Court must opt for an interpretation that protects

and advances franchise and the Sovereignty of the People rather than one which stultifies

it.

It has been held that franchise is part of the fundamental rights of a citizen. In the

Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution Bill (2017) [Decisions of the Supreme Court

on Parliamentary Bills (2016-2017) Vol. XIII, page 126 at 136] Court held:

“Right to vote is recognised as a fundamental right and denial or restriction of

exercising the franchise amounts not only to violation of Article 10 and 14(1) of the

Constitution but also attracts Article 3 of the Constitution.”

Page 11 of 11

In terms of Article 4(d) of the Constitution, Court is bound to respect, secure and advance

such fundamental rights and it should not be abridged, restricted or denied, save in the

manner and to the extent specified in the Constitution. If the Court were to accept the

submission of the Petitioner and hold that the appointment of the 9th Respondent is bad

in law due to failure to comply with the one-week time frame, it will amount to the

abridgment of the fundamental rights of the voters who voted for the United National

Party for no fault of theirs and a violation of the Sovereignty of the people who voted for

the United National Party.

Moreover, if the Court is to accept the submission of the Petitioner, it would amount to

Court adding words to Article 99A of the Constitution which is not permissible [Stassen

Exports Limited v. Brooke Bond (Ceylon) Limited and Another (1990) 2 Sri.L.R. 63 at 75,

116-117; Walgamage v. The Attorney-General (2000) 3 Sri.L.R. 1 at 8-9].

Furthermore, Article 69 of the Constitution establishes the power of Parliament to act

notwithstanding any vacancy in its membership. This militates against accepting the

submission of the Petitioner as it is clear that even where there is a failure on the part of

a recognized political party or independent group to nominate a person or persons to the

seats obtained on the National List within one week as required by Article 99A of the

Constitution, the Parliament has the power to act.

We hold that the time limit of one-week in Article 99A is directory and not mandatory.

For all the foregoing reasons, we see no basis to grant leave to proceed and dismiss the

application.
