Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Applicant wife instituted these proceedings by application

dated 25.08.2014 in the Magistrate’s Court of Bibile seeking

maintenance from the Respondent husband under section 2(1)

of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999, on the basis that the

Respondent expelled her from the matrimonial home around

9.00 p.m. on 30.07.2014 and refused to maintain her thereafter.

The Applicant did not state the reason for this incident in her

application. However, at the inquiry before the Magistrate’s

Court, it was revealed that the said incident took place due to

adultery committed by her in the matrimonial home with a

person named Guneris. The Respondent had found both of

them together on that specific day. As seen from the inquiry

notes V6 of the female Sub Inspector of the Medegama police

station (which was not marked subject to proof), the Applicant

and Guneris admitted at the inquiry that they had been

continuing with an adulterous relationship for about four

months leading up to the aforesaid incident. This is admissible

evidence. (Punchi Banda v. Seelawathie [1986] 2 Sri LR 414)

After the inquiry into the Applicant’s maintenance application,

the learned Magistrate held that the allegation of adultery had

not been proved to a high degree of proof. Hence, the

Respondent was ordered to pay maintenance to the Applicant at

a rate of Rs. 7,000 per month.

On appeal, the High Court set aside the order of the Magistrate’s

Court on the basis that the Applicant was living in adultery at

the time of filing the maintenance application and was therefore

disentitled to maintenance in terms of the proviso to section 2(1)

of the Maintenance Act.

Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act with the proviso reads as

follows:

2(1) Where any person having sufficient means, neglects or

unreasonably refuses to maintain such person’s spouse

who is unable to maintain himself or herself, the Magistrate

may, upon an application being made for maintenance, and

upon proof of such neglect or unreasonable refusal order

such person to make a monthly allowance for the

maintenance of such spouse at such monthly rate as the

Magistrate thinks fit having regard to the income of such

person and the means and circumstances of such spouse:

Provided however, that no such order shall be made if the

Applicant spouse is living in adultery or both the spouses

are living separately by mutual consent.

Being dissatisfied with the Judgment of the High Court, the

Applicant has now come before this Court on the basis that the

5

High Court misdirected itself in its interpretation of “living in

adultery” contained in the proviso to section 2(1) of the

Maintenance Act. This is the question of law upon which leave

to appeal was granted by this Court.

Learned counsel for the Applicant does not canvass the finding

of the High Court that the Applicant committed adultery with

Guneris on 30.07.2014 and for approximately four months

before the said date (as admitted at the police inquiry). His

argument is that, even assuming this is correct, the Applicant is

not disqualified from claiming maintenance from the Respondent

as there is no evidence that she was “living in adultery” (as

opposed to “committing adultery”) at the time of filing the

application, as contemplated in the proviso to section 2(1) of the

Maintenance Act.

Black’s Law Dictionary (11th Edition) at page 64 defines adultery

as “voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and

someone other than the person’s spouse.” The proof of “living in

adultery” does not mean proving the act of sexual intercourse by

direct evidence.

I am sensitive to the fact that the proviso to section 2(1) states:

“no such order shall be made if the Applicant spouse is living in

adultery”. It does not state: “no such order shall be made if the

Applicant spouse committed adultery”. It states “is living in

adultery”, not “was living in adultery” or “had been living in

adultery”. It means the Applicant at the time of making the

application was cohabiting with a person other than his or her

spouse or “living a life of promiscuous immorality” as a

6

continuing act, as distinguished from one or two lapses of virtue.

Vide Wijeysinghe v. Josi Nona (1936) 38 NLR 375, Pushpawathy

v. Santhirasegarampillai (1971) 75 NLR 353.

However, in order to prove “living in adultery”, the Respondent

spouse need not prove that the Applicant was living in adultery

on the date of filing the application. The words “living in

adultery” means the Applicant shall be living in adultery at or

about the time of filing the application. No rule of thumb can be

laid down in deciding what constitutes “at or about the time”. It

shall be decided on the unique facts and circumstances of each

individual case.

In the instant case, the Applicant was found with Guneris at

about 8.00 p.m. on 30.07.2014 in the matrimonial home. At the

police inquiry held on the following day, it was admitted that

they had been continuing with the adulterous relationship for

about four months before this incident. Thereafter, the

Applicant filed the application seeking maintenance on

25.08.2014 – less than one month after the incident. In my

view, the Applicant was living in adultery at or about the time of

filing the application for maintenance.

The facts in Weerasinghe v. Renuka [2016] 1 Sri LR 57 – the

Judgment heavily relied on by learned counsel for the Applicant

– are distinguishable. In the said case, the Applicant wife filed a

maintenance case against the Respondent husband after the

latter left the matrimonial home. The Respondent refused to pay

maintenance on the basis that there had been previous

incidents of adultery committed by the Applicant with her

7

brother-in-law. The Magistrate’s Court held with the

Respondent but the High Court set aside the order. On appeal,

this Court held that the said incidents of adulterous conduct on

the part of the Applicant with her brother-in-law had taken

place “long before the separation of the parties”, and the parties

had been living together after the said incidents until they later

separated over a “minor incident” unrelated to adultery, and

therefore the Applicant was not living in adultery “at or about

the time the application [was] made”. The facts in the instant

case are different.

The Court shall be able to depart from the plain meaning of

statutory text when its literal application would lead to

absurdity. If “living in adultery” is strictly interpreted to mean

that the Applicant shall be living in adultery on the date of or at

the time of filing the application, an astute Applicant living in

adultery can temporarily cease such adulterous cohabitation in

order to bring his or her application within the ambit of section

2 of the Maintenance Act. This could never have been the

intention of the legislature. Proximity in time between living in

adultery and filing a maintenance application is a question of

fact. Each case shall be treated independently.

In the instant case, the High Court has not misdirected itself in

its interpretation of “living in adultery” in the proviso to section

2(1) of the Maintenance Act. Hence I answer the question of law

on which leave to appeal was granted against the Applicant.

I affirm the Judgment of the High Court and dismiss the appeal

but without costs.
