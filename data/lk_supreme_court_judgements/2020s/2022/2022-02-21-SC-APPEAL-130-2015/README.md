This Judgment relates to an Appeal from judgment dated 11th September 2012

pronounced in Appeal No. WP/HCCA/GPH/10/2008(F) by the High Court of the

Provinces of the Western Province holden in Gampaha. That judgment affirmed

judgment dated 21st February 2008 pronounced in Case No. 59/M of the District Court of

Attanagalla. On 17th July 2015, following a consideration of an Application seeking leave

to appeal, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

(i) Will it amount to a violation of regulations pertaining to the conduct of examinations, if

an Invigilator were to allow a candidate to sit for the examination without ensuring

whether his examination number is listed in the attendance register?

(ii) When there is a case before court claiming damages, shouldn’t the Judge first ascertain

whether the aggrieved party claiming damages has properly established his case?

(iii)Shouldn’t a party claiming damages establish his case on a balance of probability?

(iv) Shouldn’t the Judge decide each case before him on its own merits and based on legal

grounds?

(v) Have damages been awarded to the Respondent, without proving through evidence the

damage caused to the Respondent?

In the course of the argument and during consideration of this Appeal, the following

question of law arose:

Can the Lex Aquilia be applied subject to suitable adaptations, and accordingly, in the

circumstances of this case, would the Plaintiff be entitled to damages under the Lex

Aquilia?

In this judgment, I propose to deal with all six questions of law. The primary focus of this

judgment would be the last question of law.

4 | 79

Need to refer to evidence in detail

As this Appeal is the second successive Appeal originating from the judgment of the

District Court, one would have ideally expected the multiple debates relating to the

evidence led at the trial by the Plaintiff and the Defendants to have receded to the

background, and the Appeal to have been argued based on an agreed set of facts, pivoting

around questions of pure law and questions of law mixed with facts. However, during

the hearing it became evident that learned Counsel for the Appellants and the

Respondent were not in agreement with each other on an agreed set of facts based on the

testimonies of witnesses led at the trial. Thus, the debate before this Court raged partly

on the facts. Furthermore, the questions of law which were raised, also necessitated a

detailed analysis of the evidence and conclusions being reached regarding the facts of the

case. In the circumstances, I am compelled to devote a considerable portion of this

judgment to the narration, consideration and analysis of testimonial and documentary

evidence, and pronouncing my findings inter-alia on the facts.

However, it is the expectation of this Court that unless it is unavoidable and absolutely

necessary, during the Appeal to the Supreme Court, counsel would base their

submissions on an agreed set of facts, focusing on questions of law that arise from such

facts and the impugned judgment.

Case for the Plaintiff – Respondent - Respondent

Background

The Respondent (Plaintiff) testified that having studied at Veyangoda Bandaranayake

Madya Maha Vidyalaya, she sat for the G.C.E. A/L examination for the first time in 2000.

She applied and obtained admission to sit for the same examination for a second time, in

August 2001. She chose to sit for the Combined Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, General

English and for the General Common Test examination papers, and accordingly received

admission to sit for examination papers of those subjects. The examination number she

received was 4307615. The examination centre (No. 0211) was the same school in which

5 | 79

she received her education. The ‘admission card’ she received was in two parts. The top

part contained the ‘admission card’ proper and the bottom part contained the ‘timetable’.

The two parts could be separated.

The examination commenced on 4th August 2001. On the first day she went to the

examination centre to sit for the examination in Combined Mathematics, she was

required to separate the two parts of the afore-stated document and thereafter handover

the ‘admission card’ proper to the Invigilator who officiated at her examination room.

Thereafter, it was returned to her only for the purpose of placing her signature to mark

her presence at each examination paper she faced. She retained with her the bottom part

of the document, namely the ‘timetable’. On the morning of the 4th and the afternoon of

the 6th, she sat for the Parts I and II of the examination paper in Combined Mathematics.

Similarly, on the mornings of the 8th and 9th, she sat for the Physics examination paper,

Parts I and II, respectively. Her position was that after the first day (when she had to take

with her the ‘admission card’ and the ‘National Identity Card’), she was required to take

with her, only her National Identity Card. She had not received instructions or been

advised to take with her the ‘timetable’, and hence after the first day, she did not take it

to the examination centre. It was kept at her residence.

Incident

Parts I and II of the ‘General English’ examination paper were scheduled for the morning

and afternoon of the 28th of August. As Part I of the examination was scheduled to

commence at 9.00 am, she arrived at the examination centre by 8.00 am. She proceeded

to examination room No. 1 of hall No. 3 and went up to the desk at which she answered

the two previous examination papers and took her seat. Her position is that the desk at

which she sat, was the one on which her examination number was denoted. However,

she noted that the location of the desks had been changed following the previous date of

the examination.

6 | 79

While she was seated at her desk, she observed Priyanwada Kaushalya, another

candidate from her own school, coming into the examination room and searching for her

desk. As her examination number was not denoted on any of the desks in that room,

around 8.45 am Priyanwada went to meet the Chief Invigilator (1st Appellant). After some

time, a female Invigilator (ostensibly Pushpa Ranasinghe) came up to the Respondent

and informed her that her examination number was not denoted in their lists, and asked

her to come out of the examination room. She complied. As per instructions she received

from that Invigilator, she went and met the Chief Invigilator (1st Appellant) who inquired

from her whether she applied to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper. She

answered in the affirmative. The 1st Appellant informed her that in the document he had

received (likely to be a reference to the document referred to by the 1st Appellant in his

testimony as the ‘attendance sheet’ and referred to in one question of law in respect of

which leave to appeal has been granted as the ‘attendance register’), there was no

reference to her examination number, and asked her to produce the ‘timetable’. She

informed him that she did not bring the ‘timetable’ with her and that it was at her

residence. The 1st Appellant informed her that in the circumstances, she cannot be

allowed to sit for the examination. She requested from him that she be allowed to sit for

the examination. The 1st Appellant told her that she might not have applied to sit for the

‘General English’ examination paper, and accordingly refused to permit her to sit. He

asked her to return home, check the ‘timetable’ and return on the following day to sit for

the examination paper of the next subject. As she had no other option, the Respondent

decided to return home. When she went into the room to take her belongings, she noted

that no one was seated at her desk. She also noted a few other empty desks.

Having left the examination centre, the Respondent waited immediately outside the

school for approximately half an hour contemplating what she should do. Thereafter, she

left the school and went to her residence. Having arrived at the residence, she collected

the ‘timetable’ and returned to the examination centre. She had to walk 1½ km from the

examination centre to the Veyangoda town, take a bus to go to her home, and walk

7 | 79

another 1½ km from where the bus stopped, to her home. By the time she returned to the

examination centre, the time was approximately 2.00 pm. She went and met the Principal

of the school (who was at the Principal’s quarters) and explained to him what happened.

On his advice, she went and met the 1st Appellant (Chief Invigilator) and presented to

him the ‘timetable’, which indicated that she had received admission to sit for the General

English examination paper. He informed her that by that time, she had been marked

‘absent’ for the General English examination paper. The 1st Appellant also queried from

her why in the morning she had sat at a desk different to the desk on which her

examination number had been denoted. As over 30 minutes had passed following the

commencement time of Part II of the examination paper, the 1st Appellant said that it was

not possible to permit her to sit for Part II of the General English examination paper. Thus,

she lost the opportunity of sitting for Part II of the General English examination paper, as

well.

On the 1st September she presented herself for the Chemistry examination paper. After

the examination was over, along with her father, she went to the police station and lodged

a complaint regarding the incident. She had also complained to the Commissioner

General of Examinations. She had received simple (S) passes for Physics and Combined

Mathematics, a Credit (C) pass for Chemistry and 73 marks for the General Common Test

at the G.C.E. (A/L) examination held in August 2001.

The ‘timetable’ issued to the Respondent by the Department of Examinations (which

inter-alia denotes her entitlement to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper) and

a copy of the complaint made by her to the Veyangoda police station were produced by

her marked “P1” and “P2”, respectively.

Albeit brief, the Respondent has testified as to how this entire episode caused her pain of

mind, trauma, stress and frustration, in addition to the loss suffered by her as a result of

8 | 79

having lost the opportunity to sit for the General English examination paper at the

August 2001 G.C.E. (A/L) examination.

Under cross-examination, it has been suggested to the Respondent, that she had been

seated at the desk on which Examination Candidate No. 4307470 had been denoted, and

as that was the examination number of Priyanwada Kaushalya, the latter had come and

claimed the desk. That suggestion has been denied by the Respondent. It has also been

suggested to the Respondent that when she was at the desk, Invigilator Pushpa

Ranasinghe came up to the Respondent and having checked the number, asked

Priyanwada Kaushalya to sit at the desk at which the Respondent was seated. That was

why the Respondent was referred to the Chief Invigilator (1st Appellant). The Respondent

has denied that suggestion too. Further, it has been suggested to the Respondent that

when she met the 1st Appellant, he asked her for the examination number. As she did not

have the ‘timetable’ with her, she could not reveal the examination number, and hence

she was advised to remain there for a while. Thereafter, the 1st Appellant had proceeded

to distribute examination papers. In the meantime, the Respondent had left the

examination centre. These detailed suggestions have also been denied by the Respondent.

In response, the Respondent has taken up the position that the 1st Appellant asked her to

return home, check and bring the ‘timetable’. Finally, it has been suggested to the

Respondent that it was due to her own conduct that she was deprived of the opportunity

of sitting for the General English examination paper. She has denied that suggestion as

well. She has also denied the suggestion that she gave false testimony that it was the 1st

Appellant who prevented her from sitting for the General English examination paper.

During cross-examination, learned counsel for the Appellants has marked as “V1” and

produced through the Respondent a document titled ‘Rules for Candidates’ issued by the

Commissioner General of Examinations. [These Rules appear to have been issued

purportedly under section 20 of the Public Examinations Act, No. 25 of 1968]. That the

9 | 79

Respondent suffered pain of mind, trauma, stress and frustration has not been impeached

during cross-examination.

Ganepola Arachchige Pathiraja Piyasiri Ganepola, an Investigation Officer of the

Examination Department also testified having been called by the Respondent. He has

corroborated the Respondent’s position that she received admission to sit for inter-alia

the General English examination paper, has corroborated the examination number and

produced the Respondent’s ‘admission card’ marked “P3”. The witness has explained

that a document titled ‘Attendance Sheet’ (ostensibly a reference to the ‘attendance

register’ referred to in question “(a)” in respect of which leave to appeal was granted) is

issued to Chief Invigilators by the Examination Department. It contains details pertaining

to the candidates who are entitled to sit for the examination at the relevant examination

centre. It contains information such as the name and examination numbers of the

candidates and the subjects each candidate is entitled to sit. He has also said that the

examination hall should be prepared in accordance with the information contained in the

‘Attendance Sheet’. According to him, on the first day of the examination, candidates are

required to bring the ‘admission card’ and the National Identity Card, with the signature

of the candidate attested. According to him, on the first day of the examination, the

‘admission card’ should be produced to the Invigilator, and thereafter it is retained by

the Chief Invigilator till the end of the examination. If the name of a candidate appears in

the ‘Attendance Sheet’ relating to a particular examination paper, the need to disallow

such candidate to sit for a that examination paper does not arise. He has produced

marked “P4” a handbook issued to Chief Invigilators by the Commissioner General of

Examinations, containing guidelines on the conduct of the examination.

In terms of clause 3:2:2 of “P4” (marked “P4A”), on the day prior to the examination, the

examination centre should be prepared and the desks should be numbered. While the

Chief Invigilator has the discretion to change the arrangement of desks, if there is such a

re-arrangement, on the morning of the examination, the numbers should be entered on

10 | 79

the desks, afresh. The arrangement of desks should be entered in the relevant location of

the document referred to as the ‘Journal’. The witness has explained that when effecting

changes to the arrangement of desks and denoting examination numbers on the desks,

the ‘Attendance Sheet’ should be used by the Chief Invigilator.

In terms of clause 4:3:1 of the Guidelines (marked “P4B”), if a candidate fails to produce

the ‘admission card’, and his name appears in the ‘Attendance Sheet’, the candidate

should still be permitted to sit for the examination, subject to his submitting a document

written by him stating that he admits that his candidature is subject to the approval of

the Commissioner General of Examinations. [It is to be noted that this provision would

be applicable only on the first occasion when a candidate arrives to sit for an examination

paper, as on other days, the ‘admission card’ would be with the examination authorities.]

The ‘Journal’ submitted by the 1st Appellant to higher authorities relating to the G.C.E.

Advanced Level Examination held at Veyangoda Bandaranayake Madya Maha

Vidyalaya in August 2001 was produced marked “P5”. According to advice that has been

given to Chief Invigilators, all incidents at the examination centre however trivial they

may be, should be recorded in the ‘Journal’. According to page 18 of the Journal which

contains entries relating to events of 28th August 2001, there is no entry denoting that any

special or unusual incident had occurred on that day. According to the entry found in

page 40 of the ‘Journal’, on 28th August 2001 there had been a re-arrangement of desks,

and a desk has been assigned to candidate No. 4307615 in room No. 1 of Hall No. 3. That

room had examination Nos. 4307420 to 4308131. According to the 1st Appellant, once a

candidate comes to present himself for the examination and sits at the desk on which his

examination number has been denoted, the Invigilator must afford an opportunity to him

to sit for the examination.

11 | 79

Case for the Defendants – Appellants - Appellants

According to the testimony of the 1st Appellant (1st Defendant), he was a principal of a

school, and had considerable experience at the conduct of examinations, having

participated at the conduct of GCE Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations since

1975. In 2001, due to a national Referendum that had been scheduled (which was

subsequently not held), the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination had been conducted in

two phases. The first phase of the examination was conducted from the 14th to the 17th of

August, 2001. The second phase was conducted from the 27th of August to the 1st

September, 2001. During the intervening period, certain changes had been carried out in

the examination halls. The seating arrangements were changed twice during the

examination.

At the commencement of the examination, the candidates were informed by Invigilators

to separate the ‘admission card’ from the ‘timetable’ and retain the ‘timetable’ in their

possession, since recourse to it is necessary in order to check the examination number.

Explaining the incident that took place on the 28th of August 2001, the 1st Appellant has

testified that approximately 10 minutes prior to the commencement of the General

English question paper, while he was examining question paper packets that had to be

distributed to the examination rooms, a candidate (referring to the Respondent) came up

to his work station, and informed him that her examination number was not available

(presumably a reference to a desk on which her examination number had been denoted

not being available). He inquired from her whether she had with her the ‘timetable’, to

which she answered in the negative. She told him that she came to sit for the examination

from Ratnapura. He told her to wait for some time and that he would find her

examination number. As he considered the distribution of exam papers on time to be his

primary responsibility, he attended to that duty. According to him, all that he had told

the Respondent was to wait for a while, and that he would find her examination number.

Following the distribution of examination papers to the four rooms, he returned to his

12 | 79

work station. By that time, the Respondent was not present near his work station. She

had left. The 1st Appellant has denied that he told the Respondent that she cannot be

permitted to sit for the General English examination paper, since she did not have with

her the ‘timetable’, and that he asked her to return home and bring the ‘timetable’.

Around 2.15 pm that afternoon, the Respondent had once again come up to his work

station and showed him her ‘timetable’. She had told him that she went home and

brought the timetable. She had requested for both the first and second examination

papers to be given to her to answer them. He had declined and explained why it was not

possible to accede to her request. He had informed her that passing General English was

not necessary to gain admission to university, and advised her to return home and get

ready for the next paper. He had explained that the Respondent was unable to sit for

Part II of the General English examination paper since she arrived at the examination

centre late, without checking the timetable. He had also said that in terms of the

examination rules, it was not possible to give Part I of the examination paper (which was

in the morning session) along with Part II of the paper, in the afternoon.

The 1st Appellant has explained that he did not make an entry in the ‘journal’ regarding

this incident, as what had happened was not a ‘special incident’, and incidents such as

the incident in issue occur frequently.

The 1st Appellant has emphasized that he did not intentionally obstruct the Respondent

from sitting for the General English examination paper. He has also said that he did not

act either negligently or maliciously towards the Respondent. He has testified that he

acted in terms of his official responsibilities. His position is that his conduct cannot be

attributed to the Respondent not having been able to sit for the General English

examination paper. The 1st Appellant has counter-alleged that the Respondent was not

able to sit for the General English examination paper due to her own ignorance and

recklessness.

13 | 79

Under cross-examination the 1st Appellant has denied that he told the Respondent that

she had not applied and thereby not gained the entitlement to sit for the General English

examination paper. His position is that having examined the ‘attendance sheet’, he

informed the Respondent that the examination number given by the Respondent denotes

that she had not applied to sit for the General English examination paper. His position is

that the Respondent had not revealed to him her correct examination number. He has

denied the suggestion that he got down the Respondent who was seated at the

examination hall. He has also denied the suggestion that he informed the Respondent

that she cannot be permitted to sit for the General English examination paper, as she did

not have with her the admission card and the timetable.

Judgment of the District Court

The learned District Judge has proceeded on the footing that as (a) the Respondent had

applied to sit for the General English examination paper, (b) received admission to sit

inter-alia, for the General English examination paper, and (c) arrived at the examination

centre on time, it was the responsibility of the State to have provided her the opportunity

and all necessary facilities to sit for the General English examination. The learned Judge

has expressed the view that unless a candidate fails to attend the examination centre on

time, or fails or refuses to sit for the relevant examination paper, it is the responsibility of

the State to facilitate the candidate to sit for the examination. He has observed that it was

not the position of the Appellants that the Respondent was in fact not entitled to sit the

for General English examination paper. Thus, the learned District Judge has held that the

Appellants were duty bound to have allowed the Respondent to sit for the General

English examination paper, which they have failed to do. He has concluded that it was

due to the conduct of the 1st Appellant that the Respondent lost the opportunity of

presenting herself for the General English examination paper. The judgment contains a

reference to the evidence that on the day prior to the date of the incident, the seating

arrangements had been changed. Therefore, the learned Judge has concluded that the 1st

14 | 79

Appellant had the added responsibility of ensuring that candidates are not

inconvenienced by the re-arrangement of desks, a responsibility which he had failed to

discharge properly. The learned District Judge has noted that candidates were not

required to bring the ‘timetable’ to the examination centre. Hence, the 1st Appellant

should not have called upon the Respondent to present it. The view of the learned District

Judge is that the 1st Appellant should have permitted the Respondent to sit for the

General English examination paper without probing into the issue of whether or not she

was entitled to sit for the examination paper, and thereafter, attended to possible issues

relating to her candidature and the entitlement to sit for the particular paper. The learned

District Judge has also found fault with the 1st Appellant for not having made a journal

entry regarding the incident that occurred on the 28th of August 2001.

Due to the foregoing and several other reasons contained in the Judgment of the District

Court, the learned District Judge has concluded that the Respondent lost the opportunity

to sit for the General English examination paper due to the negligence of the 1st Appellant.

He has also held that the three Appellants were jointly and severally responsible for the

incident that has been complained of, and for its repercussions.

The learned District Judge has taken into consideration (a) the mental trauma the

Respondent had suffered due to this incident, (b) that she had to sit for the General

English examination paper in the following year, (c) the negative experience she suffered,

and (d) that she had to spend an additional year to become qualified in General English,

as factors that justify the ordering of damages.

Accordingly, having answered all the issues raised on behalf of the Plaintiff (Respondent)

in favour of the Plaintiff (Respondent), and the issues raised on behalf of the Defendants

(Appellants) in the negative, the learned District Judge has held that the Plaintiff

(Respondent) was entitled to a sum of Rs. 1,000,000.00 as damages jointly and severally

from the Defendants (Appellants), and pronounced judgment in favour of the Plaintiff

15 | 79

(Respondent). This was in the backdrop of the Respondent having in the Plaint filed in

the District Court claimed damages amounting to Rs. 3,000,000.00 from the Appellants.

Judgment of the High Court of the Provinces (Civil Appellate)

Having heard the Appeal against the Judgment of the District Court, the learned Judge

of the High Court of the Provinces has in his Judgment observed that the re-arrangement

of desks in the examination halls had been contrary to the guidelines contained in “P4”.

He has also observed that as there were only 12 female candidates who had gained

admission to sit for the General English examination paper, it would not have taken much

time for the 1st Appellant to have checked the arrangement of desks relating to female

candidates and identify the desk at which the Respondent should sit. He has expressed

the view that in terms of clause 4.3.2 of “P4”, examination officials are required to provide

an opportunity to all candidates whose names appear on the ‘attendance sheet’ to sit for

the examination. Such opportunity should be provided even in instances where a

candidate does not submit the ‘admission card’. In terms of clauses 4.3.3 read with 4.4.2,

even in instances where the name of a particular candidate does not appear in the

‘attendance sheet’, if the candidate produces the ‘admission card’, arrangements should

be made to enable such candidate to sit for the examination.

In the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has expressed agreement with the

findings of the learned District Judge. He has also concluded that the Respondent was

precluded from sitting for the General English examination paper due to the negligent

conduct of the 1st Appellant.

The learned Judge of the High Court has expressed his concluding views in the following

manner: “… I sense that the learned District Judge’s decision to award one million as damages

to the Plaintiff is not whimsical or arbitrary. Therefore, in that context the learned Judge’s view

on the traumatic situation the Plaintiff faced in this event cannot be disregarded. The findings of

the trial court are accordingly affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.”

16 | 79

Submissions made on behalf of the Appellants

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Appellants, in the exercise of

his customary nature of frankness, fairness and professionalism, and in accordance with

professional ethics expected to be adhered to particularly by counsel representing the

Attorney General, rightfully conceded that in law and based on the evidence of this case,

the 1st Appellant in his capacity as the Chief Invigilator of the examination centre at which

the Respondent sat for the G.C.E. (A/L) examination in August 2001, owed a ‘legal duty

of care’ towards the Respondent. However, learned counsel’s submission was that in the

instant case, there was no breach of such legal duty of care, and thus, a cause of action

had not arisen in favour of the Respondent. His position was that under the applicable

Roman-Dutch law pertaining to the Lex Aquilia, there is no requirement that a person who

owes a duty of care should take ‘every possible precaution to avoid causing harm to the person

to whom he owes such duty’. Citing R.G. Mckerron on “The Law of Delict”, learned Senior

DSG submitted that the standard of care which the law demands is the care of diligens

paterfamilias – the care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the given

circumstances. It is the position of the Appellants that at all times relevant to this case,

the 1st Appellant exercised reasonable care as the situation warranted.

Referring to the evidence, learned Senior DSG submitted that, in his capacity as the Chief

Invigilator, the 1st Appellant had the administrative entitlement to change seating

arrangements, provided he took steps to ensure the smooth conduct of the examination.

The 1st Appellant had in the re-arrangement of seats / desks, complied with such

standard. Thus, he submitted that in so far as the re-arrangement of desks were

concerned, the 1st Appellant had clearly not acted in a wrongful or negligent manner.

As regards the second issue of the Respondent not having received an opportunity to sit

for Part I of the ‘General English’ examination paper, the position of the learned Senior

DSG was that the Respondent had not known her examination number. She had gone

and met the 1st Appellant sometime between 8.45 - 8.50 am. According to the 1st

17 | 79

Appellant, he had asked her to wait for a while until he attends to a ‘priority duty’ and

returns, and thereafter attend to her matter. What the 1st Appellant had intended to do,

was to first distribute the examination papers and thereafter return to his work station

and check and provide an opportunity for the Respondent to sit for the General English

examination paper. In this regard, learned Senior DSG submitted that in terms of “P4”,

the 1st Appellant had numerous duties, including the checking of envelopes containing

examination papers (a process which can commence only 10 minutes prior to the

scheduled time for the commencement of the examination) and also distribute

examination paper packs and ensure that the examination papers are with the relevant

candidates two minutes before the scheduled time for the commencement of the

examination. Thus, he submitted that it was reasonable on the part of the 1st Appellant to

have given priority to that function, and for having required the Respondent to wait for

a while until he performed that function. The submission of the learned Counsel for the

Appellants was that, “in these pressured circumstances, it cannot be reasonably expected for the

1st Petitioner (sic) to first resolve the Respondent’s issue before carrying out the duties he is bound

to perform as the Chief Invigilator”. Learned counsel submitted that the Respondent had left

the examination centre on her own motion, notwithstanding the 1st Appellant having

advised her to wait for a while until he returns following the distribution of examination

papers. Thus, he submitted that there was no dereliction of duty on the part of the 1st

Appellant in this regard too, and therefore he had not acted in a negligent manner.

As regards Part II of the General English examination paper, learned Senior DSG

submitted that the 1st Appellant was quite correct in not having permitted the

Respondent to sit for that paper, since according to the applicable Rules (“V1”), no

candidate should be allowed to sit for an examination paper if such candidate arrives

after the expiry of 30 minutes from the time at which the paper is scheduled to commence.

Thus, learned Counsel submitted that it was due to her own conduct that the Respondent

was unable to sit for both parts of the General English examination paper.

18 | 79

In view of the foregoing, learned Senior DSG submitted that “the 1st Petitioner (sic)

conducted himself in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations and guidelines”. Due to

the aforementioned reasons, learned Senior DSG submitted that there was no negligence

that could be reasonably attributed to the 1st Appellant.

Learned Senior DSG also submitted that in an action under the Lex Aquilia, the following

ingredients should be established by the plaintiff, namely (i) a wrongful act, (ii) pecuniary

loss resulting to the plaintiff, and (iii) fault on the part of the defendant. He also submitted

that “compensation in aquilian actions are awarded for pecuniary loss (or patrimonial loss)

suffered by the plaintiff arising out of the defendant’s negligence”. He strenuously argued

before this Court that the Respondent had failed to establish that she had suffered any

patrimonial / pecuniary loss due to the alleged negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant.

Learned Senior DSG also submitted that, though the learned District Judge had arrived

at a finding that the Respondent had suffered mental pain due to the alleged negligent

conduct of the Defendant (1st Appellant) which according to the learned District Judge

warranted the award of damages, he had not provided any justification for this

conclusion. Learned Counsel emphasized that the Respondent had not presented any

evidence to establish that she had suffered any mental suffering due to the allegedly

negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant.

He also advocated the strict application of the Lex Aquilia and insisted that the plaintiff

had a legal duty to establish patrimonial loss, a duty which, in the instant case had not

been discharged by the Plaintiff (Respondent). In this regard, learned Senior DSG cited

the following quotation from the judgment of Justice Dheeraratne in Prof. Priyani Soyza v.

Rienzie Arsecularatne [(2001) 2 Sri L.R. 293, at 302]:

“Damages claimed by the plaintiff under the head of mental shock, appear to be recoverable under

the Roman-Dutch Law as well as the English Law (if the test of reasonable foreseeability is

satisfied), only if that results in psychiatric illness. Damages on account of emotional shock of

19 | 79

short duration, which has no substantial effect on the health of a person are not recoverable. … As

pointed out by Professor de Villers (Injuries, p. 182), the compensation recoverable under the Lex

Aquilia was only for patrimonial damages, that is, loss in respect of property, business, or

prospective gains. … I think we are not entitled as judges, to change the material of the Roman

Dutch Law, but are only permitted to iron out its creases, whenever the necessity arises. Effecting

structural alterations to the Common Law should be the exclusive preserve of the Legislature. …”

In this regard, learned Senior DSG submitted that the Respondent has not offered any

evidence to establish that she suffered any psychiatric illness as a result of the alleged

negligence of the 1st Appellant. In the circumstances, it was the submission of learned

Counsel that, “damages awarded for alleged mental pain suffered by the Respondent is invalid in

law, as alleged mental pain suffered by the Respondent had not been proved in evidence and also

due to the fact that under the prevailing law, damages cannot be granted for mental pain in the

absence of proof of actual psychiatric illness”.

Learned Senior DSG also submitted that the Respondent had not established that the

impugned allegedly negligent conduct on the part of the 1st Appellant had resulted in

any loss of future earnings to the Respondent. Citing R.G. Mckerron, learned Counsel

submitted that, “the Plaintiff must prove that the act complained of caused him ‘damnum’ that

is patrimonial loss, accrued or prospective to the person injured; that is to say, loss in respect of

property, business, or prospective gains, capable of pecuniary assessment”. Learned Counsel

expressed dismay at how the learned District Judge could have, without any evidence

regarding the above criterion, awarded damages to the Plaintiff (Respondent) in a sum

of Rs. 1,000,000.00. He also submitted that there was no basis in the instant case for the

learned District Judge to have awarded damages on equitable grounds.

Learned Senior DSG has concluded his post-argument written submissions by

submitting that even if this Court were to determine that the 1st Appellant had been

negligent, ‘actual’ damages should not be awarded, as the Respondent had failed to

20 | 79

establish the justification for such damages by way of evidence. He submitted that, if at

all, only ‘nominal’ damages should be awarded, which should not exceed Rs. 100,000.00.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants drew the attention of this Court to a quotation from

Abdul Majeed on “A Modern Treatise on the Law of Delicts” which contains the view that

nominal damages are awarded in a very small amount, not as compensation for any

actual loss incurred, but merely to recognize the existence of some legal right vested in

the plaintiff, which had been violated by the defendant. Since nominal damages are not

awarded for the purpose of compensating the plaintiff, they should not exceed a nominal

amount such as five Rand.

Finally, learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that in view of the afore-stated

submissions, this Court should vacate the judgments of both the District Court and the

High Court of the Provinces, and allow this Appeal.

Submissions made on behalf of the Respondent

It was the submission of learned Counsel for the Respondent, that as pointed out also by

the learned District Judge and the learned Judge of the High Court of the Provinces, the

1st Appellant’s non-compliance with clauses 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 of “P4”

was inexcusable and such non-compliance clearly established negligence on the part of

the 1st Appellant. He submitted that based on the concurrent findings of both the District

Court and the High Court of the Provinces (which he submitted should not be interfered

with by this Court), the negligence of the 1st Appellant in refusing the Respondent to sit

for the General English examination paper had been clearly established, on more than a

balance of probabilities.

Learned Counsel for the Respondent also submitted that in the award of damages for

negligence under the Aquilian action in the Roman-Dutch law, pecuniary loss which may

even be prospective as opposed to accrued, should be considered, and accordingly

damages can be awarded to a Plaintiff, although the plaintiff has not suffered any injury

21 | 79

to the person or damage to her belongings, and not suffered any accrued pecuniary loss.

His position is that a claim for damages can be maintained in this case, on the basis of

prospective pecuniary loss. Learned counsel for the Respondent advocated a flexible

approach to the application of the Lex Aquilia. His submission was that the Lex Aquilia

should be applied with a degree of adaptation to ensure that justice is meted out.

As regards the calculation of the damages to be awarded, learned Counsel for the

Respondent citing McKerron submitted that “… although no rigid rules apply to all cases to

assist courts in determining the measure of damages to be awarded in a given case, in each set of

circumstances certain relevant considerations arise. … there is no measure of damages in the sense

of an approximate standard of money value. The assessment must largely depend on the opinion

of the individual judge, guided by the amounts awarded in similar cases in the past (due allowance

being made for the depreciation of money).” He submitted that prospective patrimonial loss

cannot be measured to a degree of mathematical accuracy. It necessarily has to be only a

rough estimate, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case,

including the economic reality of the depreciation of currency. He thus pleaded that the

Judgments of the District Court and the High Court of the Provinces be affirmed and this

Appeal be dismissed.

The submissions made by learned counsel for the Appellants and the Respondent have

inter-alia given rise to the need for this Court to consider whether a plaintiff can

successfully claim general damages in a case founded on the Lex Aquilia, even in instances

where patrimonial loss has not been specifically established.

Consideration and analysis of evidence

The position of the Respondent, that she had applied for, received admission and

therefore was entitled to sit for the General English examination paper on the 28th of

August 2001, has not been challenged on behalf of the Appellants. That position is

supported by the documentary evidence including the ‘admission card’ (“P3”).

22 | 79

The instructions on the reverse of the ‘timetable’ (“P1”) received by the Respondent,

required candidates to separate the ‘timetable’ from the ‘admission card’ and retain the

‘timetable’ with the candidate. The instructions contained therein do not require

candidates to take the ‘timetable’ to the examination centre on every day of the

examination. Rules applicable to examination candidates (“V1”) also do not impose a

requirement on candidates to take the ‘timetable’ with them to the examination centre.

Thus, the Respondent cannot be faulted for not having on the 28th August 2001 taken

“P1” with her to the examination centre. This matter is of fundamental importance to this

case.

On the first day of the examination, following the separation of the ‘admission card’ from

the ‘timetable’ at the examination hall, the former (“P3”) had been submitted by the

Respondent to the Invigilator. In this regard, it is necessary for Court to take judicial

notice of the fact that in the ordinary course of official duties, ‘admission cards’ tendered

by candidates to Invigilators on the first day of the examination would from that time

onwards remain in the custody of the Chief Invigilator till the end of the examination. On

each day of the examination, the ‘admission cards’ would be temporarily returned to the

candidates through the respective Invigilators for them to sign it against the relevant

subject and return to the Invigilator, who would in turn hand it over to the Chief

Invigilator. Thus, it is justifiable to assume that from the commencement of the

examination, the ‘admission card’ of the Respondent would have been in the official

custody of the 1st Appellant. The ‘admission card’ of all candidates including that of the

Respondent contains the name and the examination number of the candidate in issue,

and the entitlement of the candidate to sit for subjects in respect of which admission has

been granted. It is not in dispute that the ‘admission card’ of the Respondent contains a

reference to the fact that she is entitled to sit for the General English examination paper.

(Each subject is referred to in the ‘admission card’ by the number assigned to such subject

by the 2nd Appellant.)

23 | 79

On the 28th August 2001, the Respondent arrived at the examination hall well on time.

She entered one out of the four examination rooms in Hall No.3, and sat at the desk on

which she claims her examination number had been denoted. She had with her the

National Identity Card. Thus, on the 28th August 2001, when the Respondent arrived at

the examination centre, she was entitled to sit for the General English examination paper.

By being present at the examination hall on time, she showed her preparedness and

willingness to sit for the General English examination paper. This should have been

recognized by the Invigilator in-charge of the relevant examination room and by the Chief

Invigilator (1st Appellant), notwithstanding whether or not the Respondent sat at the

correct desk, which is a contentious issue in this case.

In these circumstances, as pointed out by the learned Judge of the High Court of the

Provinces, in terms of clauses 4.3.3 read with 4.4.2 of “P4”, the 1st Appellant in his capacity

as the Chief Invigilator was obliged to provide an opportunity to the Respondent to sit

for the General English examination paper.

It appears from pages of the ‘Journal’ (“P5C”) which contain entries relating to the

arrangement of desks in each of the four rooms, that on the 4th and 6th August 2001 when

the Respondent sat for the Combined Mathematics examination paper, her desk was in

room No. 1. On the 8th and 9th August 2001, when the Respondent sat for the Physics

examination paper, her desk was in room No. 2. On 28th August 2001, when the

Advanced Level examination resumed after a long break (which had taken place in view

of a national Referendum that had been scheduled to be held and later cancelled), the

desk containing the examination number of the Respondent (4307615) once again was

located in examination room No. 1. In the circumstances, it is expected that candidates

would have been quite confused with the arrangement of desks. Such possible confusion

cannot be attributed to any fault on the part of the Respondent, as it is the responsibility

of the authorities conducting the examination (agents of the 2nd Appellant, including the

24 | 79

1st Appellant) to provide necessary information and guidance regarding seating

arrangements and changes made thereto.

That on the 28th of August the Respondent had gone into an examination hall and sat at

a desk, is also a fact not in dispute. It is the Respondent’s position that she knew her

examination number and that she went and sat at the correct desk on which her

examination number was denoted. The 1st Appellant’s position is rather vague in that

regard. It is the position of the Respondent that when she was at the desk, candidate

Priyanwada Kaushalya came into the examination room, checked for the location of her

desk, and unable to find it, went and met the Invigilator of that room. Sometime after

Priyanwada Kaushalya left the room, the Invigilator in-charge of the relevant

examination room - Pushpa Ranasinghe came up to the Respondent and told her that her

name was not on the list given to them containing the names of candidates entitled to sit

for the General English examination paper. Accordingly, she asked the Respondent to go

and meet the Chief Invigilator (1st Appellant). The 1st Appellant has not admitted that

fact. His position is that while he was at his work station, the Respondent came up to him

and informed him that her examination number is not denoted on any of the desks.

If in fact, the circumstances pertaining to the Respondent having gone and met the 1st

Appellant were different to the narrative provided by the Respondent in that regard, it

was certainly possible for the Appellants to have summoned Priyanwada Kaushalya and

the Invigilator in-charge of room No. 1 - Pushpa Ranasinghe, to testify. However, the

Appellants have not done that. Only Priyanwada Kaushalya and Pushpa Ransinghe

could have offered evidence to contradict the position of the Respondent, as regards what

happened inside room No. 1 between Priyanwada Kaushalya and the Respondent, and

regarding the circumstances pertaining to the Respondent having left the examination

room and meeting the 1st Appellant. Thus, presenting their evidence was of critical

importance. In fact, the list of witnesses dated 11th September 2002 filed on behalf of the

Defendants (Appellants) contains the name of Pushpa Ranasinghe. However, she has not

25 | 79

been called to testify on behalf of the Defendants (Appellants). Thus, an inference arises

that the Appellants did not present to Court their evidence, as had their evidence been

presented, such evidence would have been contrary to the position taken up by the 1st

Appellant. This, lends support to the Respondent’s position that she was seated at the

correct desk and sequel to Priyanwada Kaushalya having been unable to locate her desk,

the Invigilator in-charge of room No. 1 told the Respondent to go and meet the 1st

Appellant.

It is necessary to note that the 1st Appellant has taken up the position that the name of the

Respondent was not in the ‘attendance sheet’. If that position is correct, it would have

been a queer situation, particularly since it is not in dispute that the Respondent had

applied to sit for the General English examination paper and had gained admission for

that subject. In the circumstances, the ‘attendance sheet’ for the 28th August 2001 ought

to have contained the name of the Respondent. If such document did not contain the

Respondent’s name, the 1st Appellant could have gained considerable justification for his

own conduct and relief for himself by producing that document, and thereby shifting the

blame to the 2nd Appellant, whose responsibility it would have been to cause the

preparation of ‘attendance sheets’ through his subordinates, containing correct

information. However, the ‘attendance sheet’ for 28th August 2001, which should have

been in the custody of the 2nd Appellant after the conduct of the examination, was not

produced at the trial. No explanation was provided for the Appellants not being able to

produce it at the trial. In the circumstances, the non-production of the ‘attendance sheet’

gives rise to an adverse inference against the Appellants that had it been produced, it

would have operated in favour of the Respondent.

As pointed out above, as at 28th of August 2001, the ‘Admission Card’ (“P3”) of the

Respondent should have been in the custody of the 1st Appellant. This is not a fact that

has been contested by the Appellants. “P3” clearly reveals the numbers of the subjects

which the Respondent was entitled to sit. Those numbers are, 10, 01, 13, 02, and 12.

26 | 79

According to “P1”, 13 is the number assigned to the subject General English. Thus, quite

independent of the ‘Attendance Sheet’, it is evident that an examination of the ‘Admission

Card’ of the Respondent would have clearly revealed to the 1st Appellant, that the

Respondent was entitled to sit for the General English examination paper. When he

encountered the problem regarding the Respondent, the 1st Appellant has not examined

the ‘Admission Card’ of the Respondent.

It is observable that contrary to the position taken up in the Answer, the Appellants have

not been able to establish that the Respondent was unable to sit for the General English

examination paper, due to her having acted contrary to the applicable Rules pertaining

to examination candidates, or due to any failure on her part. The Defendants (Appellants)

did not produce any document at the trial which supports the position that the

Respondent was not entitled to sit for the General English examination paper. Thus, the

irresistible conclusion that can be arrived at is that the 1st Appellant having required the

Respondent to produce her ‘timetable’ was unnecessary and unjustifiable. As rightly

pointed out by learned Counsel for the Respondent, when the Respondent went to meet

the 1st Appellant for the second time, around 2.00 pm, he had claimed that he marked her

‘absent’ for the General English examination paper Parts I and II, and hence she cannot

be permitted to sit for Part II of that paper. This, clearly shows that the name of the

Respondent had been on the document (‘attendance sheet’) containing the names and

numbers of candidates who were entitled to sit for the General English examination

paper. If not, as quite rightly pointed out by the learned judge of the High Court, it would

not have been possible for the 1st Appellant to have marked the Respondent ‘absent’.

The Respondent’s position is that the 1st Appellant asked her to produce the ‘timetable’

and as she did not have it in her possession, she was told by the 1st Appellant that she

should go home and bring it. Thus, she left the examination centre and proceeded to her

residence. The 1st Appellant denies that he required the Respondent do so. His position

is that he merely asked her to wait for some time until he distributes question papers to

27 | 79

the four examination rooms and return. Thus, there is a conflict of testimonies regarding

this matter. It is necessary to observe that if as the 1st Appellant stated all what the 1st

Appellant told the Respondent to do was to wait for a moment until he attends to the

distribution of question papers and return, there was no necessity for the Respondent to

have left the examination centre and proceed to her residence, knowing well that her

residence was situated quite a distance away and hence she would take a considerable

amount of time to go home, collect the timetable and return to the examination centre. In

this regard, it is pertinent to note that, one test applicable for the determination of

credibility is the ‘test of probability’. While there are several criteria based upon which

probability of a narrative given by a witness can be assessed, one criterion is the general

nature of human conduct. If all what the 1st Appellant told the Respondent to do was to

wait for a moment until he distributes the examination papers and return and that upon

his return he will resolve the Respondent’s issue, it is against the very nature of natural

human conduct for the Respondent to have left the examination centre and proceeded

home to collect and bring back the ‘timetable’. Thus, it is my view that the 1st Appellant’s

position regarding this matter is highly improbable and hence credibility cannot be

attached to his version of events regarding the circumstances under which the

Respondent left the examination centre.

That the 1st Appellant had not examined the ‘Attendance Sheet’ to check whether the

Respondent was entitled to sit for the General English examination paper is not in issue.

He has admittedly not done so, and his position is that, he gave preference to his duty of

distributing the examination papers to the four rooms on time. It is my view that checking

the ‘Attendance Sheet’ and ascertaining whether the Respondent was entitled to sit for

the General English examination paper was a duty which the 1st Appellant could have

conveniently performed without causing a delay in the distribution of examination

papers. In this regard, it is to be noted that the 1st Appellant’s work station was at the end

of a corridor on which the entrances to the four examination rooms (which were actually

classrooms) were also located. Thus, the examination rooms to which he had to go to

28 | 79

distribute the examination papers, were only a few feet away from his work station.

Therefore, having checked the ‘Attendance Sheet’, and given necessary guidance to the

Respondent, the 1st Appellant could have easily attended to his ‘priority duty’ of

distributing the question papers on time.

The Respondent has not been cross-examined by counsel for the 1st Appellant on the

position taken up by the 1st Appellant that the Respondent told him that she came for the

examination from Ratnapura. That also operates against the credibility of the position

take up by the 1st Appellant at the trial.

According to the Respondent, when she was asked by the 1st Appellant to bring the

‘timetable’, she returned initially to the examination room, and on that occasion, she saw

her desk remaining unoccupied. If in fact she had initially occupied the desk of

Priyanwada Kaushalya, that candidate ought to have been occupying the particular desk

by the time the Respondent returned to the examination room. That position has also not

been put to the Plaintiff (Respondent) by counsel for the Defendants (Appellants). If in

fact she was seated at the incorrect desk, it is likely that the Appellants would have called

either or both Invigilator Pushpa Ranasinghe and candidate Priyanwada Kaushalya to

contradict the testimony of the Respondent. Thus, there is no basis on which I can arrive

at a finding that the Respondent had not been initially seated at the desk at which she

was supposed to be seated, which contained her examination number.

Under cross-examination the 1st Appellant has stated that as routine practice,

approximately 10 minutes prior to the commencement of the examination, he takes with

him the bundle of examination papers, checks the number of candidates in each

examination room and hands over the exact number of required examination papers to

the Invigilators in-charge of each room to be distributed to the candidates. This is what

he had done on the 28th as well. Therefore, the 1st Appellant could have used this

opportunity to check the desk on which the Respondent’s examination number was

29 | 79

denoted and permitted the Respondent to sit for the General English question paper. It

would have been reasonably possible for him to engage in this course of action, as he had

only four examination rooms to visit. In the alternative, the 1st Appellant could have

asked the Respondent to accompany him, first handover the required number of question

papers to the four Invigilators in-charge of the four examination rooms, and then checked

and identified the desk assigned to the Respondent and allowed the Respondent to sit for

the examination paper.

According to the 1st Appellant, each Invigilator in-charge of an examination room has a

document referred to as the ‘comparison document’, which contains the examination

numbers of the candidates of that room. The 1st Appellant could have also examined

those documents relating to the four examination rooms to identify the examination

number of the Respondent and thereby determine the hall in which she should sit and

answer the examination paper. If that process resulted in the Respondent getting a couple

of minutes late to commence answering the question paper, as admitted by the 1st

Appellant under cross-examination, he could have permitted the Respondent to take a

few minutes more at the end of the time allocated to answer the examination paper to

complete answering the paper.

The 1st Appellant’s position is that having examined the ‘attendance sheet’ he informed

the Respondent that the examination number given by her denotes that she had not

applied to sit for the General English examination paper. He thereby hints that the

Respondent had not revealed to him her correct examination number. However, as

admitted by the 1st Appellant, the ‘Attendance Sheet’ contains not only the examination

number of candidates, but their respective names as well. Therefore, had the 1st Appellant

inquired from the Respondent what her name was (at the time he inquired from her, what

her examination number was), he could have without any difficulty ascertained whether

she had applied to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper, and if so, whether she

was entitled to sit for that question paper. If in fact the 1st Appellant asked the Respondent

30 | 79

to wait for a while until he distributes the question papers to the Invigilators in-charge of

the 4 examination rooms and returns to resolve her problem, as observed by me earlier,

there would have been no reason for the Respondent to have left the examination centre

and return home to collect and bring the ‘timetable’.

The critical factor that operates against the position taken up by the 1st Appellant is its

improbability and the belatedness in taking up the position he took up in this case,

without having made a journal entry in the Journal in which he was required to make

entries regarding various unusual incidents that occur. This Court cannot agree with the

position taken up by the 1st Appellant that the incident involving the Respondent was a

‘trivial’ incident, not worthy of being reported in the Journal. In fact, clause 12(iii) of “P4”

requires Chief Invigilators to make a journal entry in respect of every unusual incident

that occurs, however trivial it may be. This Court must take note of the fact that the

incident which resulted in the Respondent having lost the opportunity to sit for the

General English examination paper is of sufficient importance to have been recorded by

the 1st Appellant in the ‘Journal’. Had the 1st Appellant made a contemporaneous journal

entry regarding the incident, it would have been possible to assess the credibility of his

narrative by applying the test of ‘spontaneity’. As it is, his position suffers from

‘belatedness’, which is another test for the assessment of credibility.

“P2” which is a copy of the statement made by the Respondent to the Veyangoda police

station on 1st September 2001, is parallel to her testimony given at the trial. Thus, it is seen

that she has maintained ‘consistency’ as regards her position, which is yet another test

based upon which credibility of a witness should be assessed.

Conclusions

Thus, in view of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the Respondent is a credible

witness. In the circumstances and in view of the supporting documentary evidence which

serves to corroborate the Respondent’s narrative, a high degree of testimonial

31 | 79

trustworthiness can be attached to her testimony. On the other hand, the version of events

as narrated by the 1st Appellant is improbable and belated, and hence lacks credibility.

Furthermore, the narrative as testified to by the 1st Appellant contains a gaping lacuna,

particularly occasioned by the failure to present the evidence of Pushpa Ranasinghe and

by not producing the ‘attendance register’. Thus, it is not possible to attribute any

testimonial trustworthiness to the 1st Appellant’s testimony.

In view of the foregoing, this Court accepts the narrative of events as presented by the

Respondent as reflective of the actual sequence of events pertaining to the incident that

occurred on 28th August 2001. The Respondent’s position convinces Court and hence it

can be concluded that she has ‘proved’ her case on a balance of probabilities as is required

to be applied in a civil trial of this nature. Thus, accepting the narrative of the Respondent

regarding the incidents that resulted in the Respondent not receiving the opportunity to

sit for the General English examination paper, I conclude that it was the negligent

conduct of the 1st Appellant who was acting as the agent of the 2nd Appellant on the

impugned occasion, which resulted in the Respondent losing the opportunity of

presenting herself and sitting for the General English examination paper at the G.C.E.

A/L examination conducted in August 2001. I also conclude that such situation was not

occasioned due to any failure or other factor such as contributory negligence that the 1st

Appellant purportedly attributed to the Respondent.

Lex Aquilia

A common feature of the submissions made by the learned Senior DSG for the Appellants

and the learned Counsel for the Respondent regarding their respective cases, and in my

opinion quite rightly so, was that the instant case is premised upon the Lex Aquilia

(Aquilian action). Albeit brief, a consideration of the origin and evolution of the Lex

Aquilia would be pertinent to justify the conclusions I propose to reach in this matter.

32 | 79

The Lex Aquilia which means the ‘law proposed by Aquilias’ is a fundamental and

important type of legal remedy originally found in the ancient Roman law. In Gaffoor v.

Wilson and Another [(1990) 1 Sri L.R. 142], Justice A.R.B. Amerasinghe has captured the

origins of the Lex Aquilia in the following manner:

“The act complained of is a wrong which is technically known as damnum injuria datum.

This was created by the Lex Aquilia which was a plebiscite attributed to various years.

Suarez holds that the Aquilian law was passed about 133 B.C. Mommsen thinks that it

was enacted before 76 BC. Pernice advances very cogent reasons for the contention that

this law was passed in the year 287 B.C. This ancient Roman statute is the foundation of

our law in regard to damage caused by Negligence.”

R.W. Lee, in his treatise titled Elements in Roman Law (4th Ed., p.393), has described the Lex

Aquilia as a plebiscite attributed to the year 287 B.C. His view is that the 12 Tables and

subsequent laws had dealt with specific cases of damages to property, but this legislation

was abrogated or superseded by the statute Lex Aquilia. A similar view has been held by

H.W. Tambiah in “Principles of Ceylon Law” (1972, page 390).

According to literature, the original Lex Aquilia contained three chapters of laws. The

earliest surviving commentary of the lex is that attributed to Brutus, believed to have been

written in 2 AD. During an unspecified early period, the second chapter had fallen into

disuse. Justinian’s codification of the laws of the Roman era (Codex Justinianus – Code of

Justinian - Corpus Juris Civilis) in 529 AD contains only the first and third chapters of the

Lex Aquilia. The original thrust of this lex was on ‘damage unlawfully or wrongfully

inflicted by one in respect of the property of another’. The first chapter provided redress

to those whose slaves and herd animals were unlawfully killed by a method of killing

referred to as occidere. The lex provided the wrongdoer to be ordered to pay the owner

the highest monetary value of the slave or the animal concerned, during the year

preceding the killing. The third chapter provided relief for those whose corporeal

33 | 79

property had been unlawfully damaged by another by burning, breaking or smashing.

The lex stipulated that the wrongdoer shall be ordered to pay the owner of the property

the average value of the property during the 30 days period preceding the damage having

been inflicted. With the early evolution of the Roman law, the third chapter developed to

cover all damages to property not covered by the first chapter. It had been well

understood during the Roman era itself, that what was meant by ‘unlawful’ or ‘wrongful’

killing or ‘infliction of damage to property’ included damage caused both due to

intentional as well as negligent conduct, for which there was no lawful justification.

Jurists have opined that the relief that could be obtained was not reparation in the form

of replacement of the property, but monetary compensation. Thus, the core principle

based upon which the Lex Aquilia had been originally founded was accountability in

respect of damage to or loss of property, inflicted through ‘intentional wrongdoing’

(dolus) or ‘unintentional and unjustifiable, and hence blameworthy wrongdoing -

negligence’ (culpa), resulting in monetary compensation being payable by the wrongdoer

to the owner of the property. It is important to note that at the outset, the lex was not

meant to be used for personal bodily injury caused to the complainant.

Though this was the original form and content of the Lex Aquilia, it is the unanimous view

of all jurists that the Lex Aquilia as well as other Roman era legal principles and legal

mechanisms evolved both during the Roman period itself and during subsequent times.

This evolution of the lex was to cater to changing social, economic and political

circumstances, and the needs of individuals and the society. For example, the Lex Aquilia

evolved and expanded within a short period of time to cover injury inflicted to the body

of the complainant. For instance, according to Boberg (The Law of Delict, vol.1, p.18), the

remedy that compensation in the form of solatium may also be recovered for pain and

suffering and other non-patrimonial elements of loss associated with bodily injuries (for

example, loss of amenities of life, loss of expectation of life, disfigurement and the like),

were unknown to the Romans and evolved from Germanic customs. They were adopted

by the Roman-Dutch writers who generally treated it as an exception to Aquilian liability.

34 | 79

H.W. Tambiah in “Principles of Ceylon Law” (1972, at page 390), has also expressed the

view that “In time, the scope and ambit of this action was greatly extended, partly by the

interpretation of the jurisconsults, and partly by the actiones utiles and actiones in factum granted

by the praetor in the exercise of his equitable jurisdiction. … As a result of juristic interpretation,

the provisions of Lex Aquilia were extended so as to grant a plaintiff a remedy for compensation

for the entire pecuniary loss which he has sustained in consequence of the defendant’s wrongful

act, and not merely for the damage caused to the thing itself as was originally the case.” In fact,

if the Lex Aquilia did not evolve with the evolution of human civilization and social needs,

with the passage of time, the Lex Aquilia would have become yet another respected piece

of legal artefact of a bygone era, preserved in a museum of laws.

In several South African cases, judges have observed that the Lex Aquilia has evolved

from its original scope. In Union Government (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v

Warneke [911 A.D. 657, at 664], Justice Innes held as follows:

“… we are still at liberty to inquire whether there is any reason why we should not make

it available now. The position of our law with regard to negligence today is the result of the

growth and the regulated expansion of the original provisions of the Lex Aquilia. Crude

and archaic in some respects, their operation was gradually widened by the application of

the utilis actio, and by the interpretation of the Roman jurists. The broadening process was

continued by Dutch lawyers on the same lines; and there is no reason why our Courts

should not similarly adapt the doctrine and reasoning of the law to the conditions

of modern life, so far as that can be done without doing violence to its principles.”

(Emphasis added.)

In Matthews and others v Young [(1922) A.D. 492, at 504], De Villiers, J. has held as

follows:

“For as the late Chief Justice, upon a consideration of the authorities in Cape of Good Hope

Bank v Fischer, pointed out, in the time of Voet and Matthaeus, the Aquilian law had

35 | 79

received an extension by analogy to a degree never permitted under the Roman law, the

actio in factum being extended to every kind of loss sustained by a person in

consequence of the wrongful acts of another…” (Emphasis added.)

In Lillicrap, Wassenaar and Partners v Pilkington Brothers (SA)(Pty) Ltd. [(1985) (1) SA

475 (AD)], Grosskopf, J. has held that “It is clear that in our law Aquilian liability has long

outgrown its earlier limitation to damages arising from physical damage or personal injury…”.

In Gaffoor v. Wilson and Another, justice Amerasinghe refers to the gradual evolution of

this instrument of the Roman law in the following manner:

“Although at first the law was narrowly construed, the remedy being available only to the

owner of damaged property and where there had been physical destruction and not merely

deterioration, the scope of the action was greatly extended partly by means of ‘actiones

utiles’ and ‘actiones in factum’, and by the time of Justinian, the net of extended actions

had spread far enough to cover a father’s interest in the physical fitness and earning

capacity of his child, even though the father was not the owner of his son and although

there was no rumpere, i.e. shattering or breaking down when the son’s earning capacity

was reduced by an injury to his eye. Whether Chief Justice de Villiers claim in Cape of

Good Hope Bank v. Fischer that in the time of Voet and Matthaeus ‘the Aquilian action …

was no longer confined to cases of damage done to corporeal property, but was extended to

every kind of loss sustained by a person in consequence of the wrongful acts of another’ is

justified or not, it is clear that the scope of the action was greatly extended from time to

time.”

According to Percival Gane’s translation of Voet’s Commentary on the Pandects, (1955 -

vol.2, page 545), “utilis actio” is translated as “beneficial action” and also suggests

“extended action” and “analogical action”. According to Gane, “beneficial is on the other

36 | 79

hand, an actual rendering of the meaning of the word ‘utilis’. It suggests moreover, as is the fact,

that the action was extended because it was for the public benefit that it should be extended.”

The Aquilian action along with the other Roman law action – the Actio Injuriarum, provide

judicial remedies for victims of various forms of unlawful conduct. Historians have

recorded that the reception of Roman law into the law of Holland (The Netherlands) took

place over a period of time, and particularly during the 15th and 16th Centuries. The

original ‘Roman Dutch Law’ (named by Simon Van Leeuwen in 1652 as Roomsch Hollandts

– Recht) had in it components of both civil and criminal law, which included an evolved

version of the Lex Aquilia from the original lex of the Roman law. Johannes Voet (who is

recognized undoubtedly as the foremost authority on the Roman-Dutch law) in his

“Commentarius ad Pandectas” published in 1698, has commented that it (the Roman Dutch

law) is a ‘living thing’. It is pertinent to note that the Roman-Dutch law was abolished in

Holland in 1809, and replaced initially by the Code Napolean and subsequently in 1839 by

the Dutch Civil Code. Thus, it is no longer possible to consider present era judgments of

Holland to ascertain the evolution and the present character of the Lex Aquilia and its

contemporary application.

The Lex Aquilia contains a legal basis on which a complainant can seek judicial redress in

respect of certain forms of wrongdoing, by pursuing litigation against the wrongdoer in

a Court of law. It takes the form of an action for damages in respect of certain forms of

wrongdoing which have resulted in certain consequences to the plaintiff. Professor R.G.

McKerron (7th Edition - 1971, page 13) in his monumental treatise on “The Law of Delict”

has expressed the undisputed general view that there are three essentials of liability in

the Aquilian action; first, a wrongful act, second, fault on the part of the defendant, and

third, pecuniary loss resulting to the plaintiff. The first requirement means that the act

complained of must involve the invasion of a right – that is to say, the violation of a legally

protected interest of the plaintiff. The second requirement means that the loss must be

imputable to the defendant; that is to say, the defendant must be responsible for the

37 | 79

wrongdoing, and (i) must have intended the loss to occur, or (ii) he could have by the

exercise of reasonable care been able to prevent its occurrence. Thus, in the terminology

of the Roman law, the defendant must have been guilty either of ‘dolus’ or ‘culpa’. ‘Culpa’

is associated with negligence, and is an unintentional form of conduct amounting to

wrongdoing resulting in legal culpability being attracted to the negligent person. The

third requirement speaks for itself, that is, consequential financial loss to the plaintiff

arising out of the impugned wrongdoing.

Actionable Negligence

It is well accepted that negligent conduct and negligent omission are two forms of negligent

wrongdoing, which may give rise to culpa and thus facilitate the possibility of a Court

considering the grant of judicial redress to the victim through the application of the Lex

Aquilia. It is not every negligent act or negligent omission that would give rise to a cause

of action under the Lex Aquilia. In colloquial terminology, negligence in the air does not

give rise to a cause of action. Only certain forms of negligence which can be referred to

as actionable negligence would come within the scope of the Lex Aquilia and thus give rise

to a cause of action which would enable the aggrieved party to seek and obtain redress

from a Court of law. Thus, the commencing point of the legal analysis of the instant

Appeal is founded upon the need to arrive at a determination on whether in the

circumstances of this case, the conduct which should be attributed to the 1st Appellant

amounts to actionable negligence.

The term negligence stems from the Latin term neglegentia (also spelled as negligentia), and

generally means carelessness or inattentive omission. While it is not possible to provide

a universally applicable definition of the term negligence, broadly speaking, negligence is

the failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have

exercised under the given circumstances. It would include any conduct that falls below

the legal standard established to protect others against possible harm. Conduct that is

intentional or willful does not come within the scope of negligence, and based on the

38 | 79

attendant circumstances, may come within the scope of dolus. Conduct which a

reasonable and prudent person would in the given circumstances not have engaged in,

or failure to do what such a person would have in the circumstances have performed,

amounts to negligence. In Roman-Dutch law, the ‘reasonable and prudent person’ referred to

for the purpose of applying this control test in order to determine whether the impugned

conduct amounts to negligence or not, is referred to as the diligens paterfamilias. It would

thus be seen that Culpa in Roman-Dutch law which is a concept almost synonymous with

negligence is the failure on the part of the wrongdoer to not foresee what a reasonable man

would have foreseen, and thus, prevent it from happening. It is important to note that

the question for judges called upon to adjudicate civil cases founded upon Culpa in the

Lex Aquilia is not to determine what the defendant was actually thinking of at or about

the time of his impugned conduct expecting or not expecting a particular outcome, but,

whether his impugned conduct or behaviour was or was not of such character as the

Court ought to demand from a reasonable and prudent man in the given circumstances.

Considered as an objective fact, negligence may be defined as ‘conduct which involves an

unreasonable, unjustifiable or preventable risk of harm to others’. Negligence is the failure

in the given circumstances to have exercised that degree of care which the circumstances

demanded. It is a relative and not an absolute conception and may consist either in failure

to have done something which a prudent and reasonable man would have done in the

given circumstances, or having done something which a prudent and reasonable man

would not have done in the given circumstances.

It is necessary to observe that due diligence is the opposite of negligence. Thus, that the

defendant had exercised due diligence to an extent a reasonable and prudent person would

have, would negate the conclusion that the defendant was negligent.

However, negligence per se or negligence ‘in the air’ will not be a ground for civil liability,

unless there existed in the particular case, a legal duty of care. A man cannot be faulted

in law for being negligent, unless he had an obligation towards others to exercise due

39 | 79

diligence, and he failed to observe such degree of due diligence which a reasonable and

prudent person would have exercised in the given circumstances. Therefore, the legal

conception of actionable negligence involves three elements – negligence, a duty of care and

a breach of that duty. It is only when these three elements are established, that the

negligent person can be held to have been responsible for actionable negligence and hence

legally accountable (culpable in terms of the law) through the Lex Aquilia.

Lex Aquilia and the Roman-Dutch common law of Sri Lanka

Following the arrival of the Dutch in Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was called then), and having

secured from the Portuguese the control of the island, during their period of colonial rule

(1656 to 1796) the Dutch introduced to the colony, the Roman-Dutch law and Dutch

institutions of justice such as the Raden van Justitie (the High Court of Justice), the

Landraden (the Land or Country or District Courts) and the Civiele Raden or Stads Raden

(the Civil or Town Courts). As regards the application of the law during the Dutch era,

Professor T. Nadaraja in his monumental work “The Legal System of Ceylon in the historical

setting” (1972), quoting a note written by onetime Dutch Commander of Jaffna A.

Pavilioen to his successor, has expressed the view that justice had been administered to

the Dutch and other Europeans according to the laws in force in the ‘Fatherland’ and the

Statutes of Batavia. The natives (Ceylonese) were governed according to their own

customs if such customs were clear and reasonable and otherwise, according to Dutch

law. Further, enactments of the Governor and those of the Council of Ceylon had also

been applied. Professor Nadaraja has added that another source of law were the

judgments of Courts established by the Dutch. That explains the arrival of the Roman-

Dutch law in Sri Lanka and the birth of the common law as introduced by the Dutch.

The nature, contents and the form of the Lex Aquilia when it was originally introduced to

Ceylon by the judges of the Dutch era, are not clear. Whether this important instrument

of civil litigation was specifically introduced through an ‘Old Statute of Batavia’, a ‘New

Statute of Batavia’, a Proclamation enacted by the Directorate referred to as the ‘Council

40 | 79

of Seventeen’ or ‘Lords Seventeen’ of the United Netherlands Chartered East India

Company (VOC) for its colonies including Ceylon, legislation enacted by the legislature

of The Netherlands at that time – the ‘States-General (Staten-Generaal) of the Republic of

the United Netherland’, by a Placaat, or through the gradual introduction and application

of Dutch laws on a case by case basis when Dutch judges were called upon to decide cases

in Ceylon, is also not clear. Therefore, the exact nature and the scope of the Lex Aquilia at

the time of its original induction to the body of Ceylon’s substantive laws is difficult, if

not impossible to be ascertained. Furthermore, when various aspects of the Roman-Dutch

law including the Lex Aquilia were introduced by the Dutch colonizers, it is unclear

whether Dutch judges were permitted to apply them subject to adaptations and

modifications to suit domestic conditions in the colony.

Nevertheless, treatises by respected authors (who have extensively quoted original

commentaries on the subject by jurists) such as Simon Van Leeuwen, Hugo Grotius and

Johannes Voet, and judgments pronounced during the British colonial era and those of

the post-independence era, are available as authentic sources of the Lex Aquilia. In my

view, it would be both reliable and reasonable to assume that at the time of its

introduction to Ceylonese legal system, the Lex Aquilia had already evolved since its

original promulgation during the Roman era. That being due to the influence of Dutch

customs, societal requirements, native laws of Holland and the integration of German

legal principles to the body of Dutch laws. Therefore, at the time of the infusion of the Lex

Aquilia into the body of substantive civil law of Ceylon (during the Dutch colonial era), it

would have necessarily evolved from the original textual contents of the original Roman

plebiscite. However, the exact nature and the scope of the Lex Aquilia when it was initially

applied in Ceylon during the early years of the Dutch era is not possible to trace, mainly

due to inaccessibility of judgments of that era. It is however evident that since the infusion

of the Lex Aquilia into the laws of Ceylon, it has remained to-date in the body of the

common law of this country.

41 | 79

Can the Roman-Dutch law be adapted and applied to suit contemporary requirements

or are judges obliged to apply it only in its purported original form?

In the course of making submissions, learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

Appellants insisted that in order to be successful in an Aquilian action and to be able to

obtain general damages, the Plaintiff must establish ensuing patrimonial loss which has

arisen out of actionable negligence on the part of the Defendant. He submitted that in the

instant case, the Plaintiff (Respondent) had not established that she suffered any

calculable patrimonial loss arising out of the negligence of the 1st Defendant (1st

Appellant). Thus, an important question arose during the argument of this Appeal, as to

‘whether in an Aquilian action, a plaintiff who has not established calculable patrimonial loss due

to the negligence of the alleged wrongdoer, would be entitled to succeed in obtaining general

damages’. This judgment seeks to primarily answer that question of law.

This issue also gives rise to a related question, whether the Lex Aquilia which is a

component of the Roman-Dutch common law of this country, is amenable to a degree of

adaptation to suit ever changing and contemporary requirements. Thus, the following

consideration of the law.

As to whether courts applying the Roman-Dutch common law have the jurisdiction to

make suitable adaptations to Roman-Dutch common law and thereafter apply it to suit

contemporary requirements, primarily pivot around interpretations contained in

judgments relating to the 1799 Proclamation issued by the British colonial rulers. This is

primarily because, there does not seem to have been any written law promulgated prior

to 1799 which contains a reference to the Roman-Dutch law and in particular at the time

the Roman-Dutch law was introduced by the Dutch colonizers to Ceylon.

History records that having arrived in the country, in 1795, British colonizers captured

Trincomalee and Colombo from the Dutch. Thereafter, on 15th February 1796, the Dutch

42 | 79

capitulated the maritime provinces of Ceylon to the British. Following a brief period of

rule of the maritime provinces by the British East India Company, in 1802, Ceylon became

a proper British Crown colony. Following the signing of the Kandyan Convention on 2nd

March 1815, the entire island fell under British colonial rule and became a subject of the

British monarchial sovereignty. Whether such accession of Ceylon to the British empire

was lawful is a different question altogether.

According to Professor Nadaraja (page 181), there had been a British constitutional

practice and of International Law of that era that had been settled before the conquest of

the maritime provinces of Ceylon, that the laws of a conquered country shall continue to

remain in force until they are altered by the conqueror. Article 23 of the Articles of

Capitulation of 1796 is of significance in this regard, and provided as follows:

“Article 23rd - All Civil suits depending in the Council of Justice shall be decided by the same

Council according to our Laws.

Answer – Granted, but they must be decided in twelve months from this date.”

Thus, it is seen that a request of the Dutch that the Dutch laws (which prevailed in Ceylon

at the time of the Dutch capitulation of the maritime provinces to the British in 1796) had

at least in theory been permitted by the British to remain in force, notwithstanding the

British colonizers assuming control over the maritime provinces. Nevertheless, according

to historians, immediately following capitulation, there had been some confusion as to

which law would actually be enforced in the country. Apparently, there had also been a

degree of reluctance on the part of Dutch judges to accept British sovereignty and the

British legal system. In this backdrop, according to Professor Nadaraja (page 57), the first

British Governor Frederick North who arrived in the country in October 1798, had

received instructions from London (instructions of 25th May 1798 from the Court of

Directors of the East India Company to Governor Fredrick North), to, for the time being,

cause the administration of justice as far as possible according to the ‘laws and

institutions that subsisted under the Dutch Government, and that after due inquiry, he

should suggest any improvements which he might think desirable’. In my view, it should

43 | 79

be in this light that the promulgation of the 1799 Proclamation issued by the British

colonizers on 23rd September 1799 should be seen. The first paragraph (also referred to as

the ‘preamble’ by some judges and authors) of the 1799 Proclamation issued on the Order

of Governor Frederick North by Secretary to the Governor Hugh Cleghorn, provided as

follows:

“Whereas it is His Majesty’s gracious Command, that for the present and during His

Majesty’s will and pleasure, the temporary Administration of Justice and Police in

the Settlements of the Island of Ceylon now in His Majesty’s Dominion, and in the

Territories and Dependencies thereof, should, as nearly as circumstances will permit, be

exercised by us, in conformity to the Laws and Institutions that subsisted under

the ancient Government of the United Provinces, subject to such deviations in

consequence of sudden and unforeseen emergencies, or to such expedients and

useful alterations as may render a departure therefrom, either absolutely

necessary and unavoidable, or evidently beneficial and desirable; and subject also

to such directions, alterations, and improvements, as shall be directed or approved of by the

Court of Directors of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East

Indies, or the secret Committee thereof, or by the Governor General in Council of Fort

William in Bengal.” (Emphasis added by me.)

In a couple of judgments of the Supreme Court, there has been some doubt expressed

regarding the exact contents of the 1799 Proclamation. Thus, I have reproduced here

verbatim, the relevant paragraph of the Proclamation obtained from Volume I of the

“Collection of Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government (from 1796 to 1833)” published

in 1853. This publication by the then Government of Ceylon, is the first in a series of

Legislative Enactments published by the government from time to time, and can thus be

recognized as containing authentic texts of legislation promulgated during the period

1796 to 1833.

44 | 79

It would be seen that particularly due to the grammatical construction and the length of

the preamble of the 1799 Proclamation, it is difficult to provide a lucid literal meaning to

the contents of this Proclamation. However, it would be seen that the 1799 Proclamation

had been issued as an urgent and temporary measure. (In the list of ‘Contents’ under the

title ‘1799 Proclamation’, the objective of the Proclamation is provided as, “Promulgating

Regulations for the temporary Administration of Justice and Police throughout the colony”.) It is

seen that the Proclamation provided for the continued application of the Roman-Dutch

law and for the functioning of Dutch installed institutions of justice and the police, as

nearly as it may be possible. However, the Proclamation provided for considerable

flexibility in the application of the law and the running of institutions. It was possible to

introduce deviations to that law and to the institutions, due to (a) sudden or unforeseen

emergencies, (b) expediency, (c) alterations being useful, (d) alterations being either

absolutely necessary and unavoidable, or beneficial and desirable. The Proclamation was

specific regarding who was empowered to introduce such deviations. The Proclamation

provided for directions, alterations and improvements to be introduced by (i) the Court

of Directors of the United Company of Merchants of England operating in the East Indies,

(ii) by the Secret Committee of that company, and (iii) by the Governor General in Council

of Fort William in Bengal. However, in view of the language used and the structuring of

the relevant clause of the Proclamation, it is arguable that the authority to introduce

‘deviations’ from the Roman-Dutch law was not limited to the exclusive prerogative of

the authorities who were specifically referred to in the Proclamation to issue ‘directions’,

‘alterations’ and ‘improvements’. I will not at this stage itself pronounce my conclusion

regarding this debatable point, in view of the following further analysis which I propose

to engage in.

The Proclamation of 1799 was followed by the Royal Charter of 1801, which inter alia

established the Supreme Court of Ceylon and conferred jurisdiction to it. Articles 2 and

39 of the Charter of 1801, respectively, provided as follows:

45 | 79

“And whereas, by Our Instructions to the said Frederick North, We declared it to be Our

Will and Pleasure that for the present, and during Our Will and Pleasure, the temporary

Administration of Justice and Police in the said Settlements, and in the Territories and

Dependencies thereof, should, as nearly as Circumstances would permit, be exercised by

Our said Governor in Conformity to the Laws and Institutions that subsisted under the

ancient Government of the United Provinces, subject to such Deviations in consequence

of sudden and unforeseen Emergencies or to such Expedients and useful Alterations, as

might render a Departure therefrom, either absolutely necessary and unavoidable, or

evidently beneficial and desirable.”

“And it is Our further Will and Pleasure, and We do hereby, for Us, Our Heirs and

Successors, grant, ordain, and establish, that the said Supreme Court of Judicature in

the Island of Ceylon shall also be a Court of Equity, and shall and may have full Power

and Authority, to Administer Justice in a summary Manner, according to the Law now

established in the said Settlements in the Island of Ceylon, and in Point of Form, as nearly

as may be, according to the Rules and Proceedings of our High Court of Chancery in Great

Britain; and upon a Bill filed, to issue Subpoenas, and other Process under the Seal of the

said Supreme Court of Judicature, to compel the Appearance, and Answer upon Oath, of

the Parties therein complained against and Obedience to the Decrees and Orders of the said

Court of Equity, in such Manner and Form, and to such Effect, as Our High Chancellor

of Our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, doth or lawfully may, under Our

Great Seal of Our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.” (Emphasis added.)

A new and uniformed system of justice was introduced to the country by the Ceylon

Charter of Justice of 1833. That Charter did not have a direct impact on the preservation

of the Roman-Dutch law in Ceylon. To clear a possible doubt regarding the status of laws

introduced by the British themselves during the intervenient period, and to ensure the

continued applicability of the pre-British era substantive laws, another law was

promulgated in 1835 amending the Proclamation of 1799. That was Ordinance No. 5 of

46 | 79

1835 issued on 21st December 1835. The portion relevant in the Ordinance of 1835 to the

continued preservation of the Roman-Dutch law in Ceylon reads as follows:

“Whereas by reason of the many fundamental alterations in the Administration of Justice

within these settlements effected by His Majesty’s Charter, bearing the date 18th day of

February 1833, and on other accounts, the provisions contained in many of the

Proclamations and Regulations of Government heretofore passed have become obsolete, or

are rendered inexpedient, or inapplicable to the present institutions.

It is therefore hereby enacted by the Governor of Ceylon, with the advice and consent of the

Legislative Council thereof, that the several Proclamations and Regulations of Government

following, except in so far as they repeal any former provisions, be and the same are hereby

repealed ; that is to say, the Proclamation of the 23rd September 1799, except in so

far as the same doth publish and declare that the Administration of Justice and

Police within the Settlements then under the British Dominion and known by the

designation of the Maritime Provinces should be exercised by all Courts of Judicature,

Civil and Criminal, according to the laws and institutions that subsisted under

the ancient Government of the United Provinces ; which laws and institutions it

is hereby declared, still are and shall henceforth continue to be binding and

administered through the Maritime Provinces and their dependencies, subject

nevertheless to such deviations and alterations as have been, or shall hereafter be

by lawful authority ordained ; and except in so far as the same doth abolish the

application of torture …” (Emphasis added.)

The afore-contained portion of the Ordinance No. 5 of 1835 is a verbatim reproduction

obtained from Volume II of “A Collection of Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government

(from 1833 to 1852)” published in 1854 by the Government of Ceylon, and hence can be

recognized as being an authentic reflection of the contents of the Ordinance.

47 | 79

The Ordinance of 1835 although fundamentally repealed a major portion of the

Proclamation of 1799, provided specifically that the administration of justice and the

police shall within the maritime provinces, be carried out and enforced by Courts in

accordance with the laws which were in force during the Dutch period, and that those

laws shall remain binding, subject however to deviations and alterations which have

been ordained and those thereafter be by lawful authority ordained. The Ordinance of

1835 gives rise to a question of interpretation as to who were intended to be included in

the term ‘lawful authority’.

Chapter 12 under ‘Title II - Administration of Justice’ of the Legislative Enactments of

Ceylon – 1956 Revised Edition (Volume I) (prepared under the authority of the revised

edition of the Legislative Enactments Act No. 2 of 1956 and published in 1958 by the

Government Publications Bureau) contains an Ordinance entitled ‘Adoption of Roman-

Dutch Law’ containing both the Proclamation of 23rd September 1799 and Ordinance No.

5 of 1835. Thus, it is an amalgamation of the afore-discussed Proclamation of 1799 and

Ordinance of 1835. Its preamble contains the text of the 1799 Proclamation commencing

with the words “Whereas it is His Majesty’s gracious command that …” and ends with the

words “… either absolutely necessary and unavoidable or evidently beneficial and desirable.”

The operative part of the Ordinance commences with a paragraph numbered ‘section 2’.

Its contents are as follows:

“We therefore, in obedience to His Majesty’s commands, do hereby publish and declare,

that the administration of justice and police in the said settlements and territories in the

Island of Ceylon, with their dependencies, shall be henceforth and during His Majesty’s

pleasure exercised by all courts of judicature, civil and criminal, magistrates, and

ministerial officers, according to the laws and institutions that subsisted under the

ancient government of the United Provinces, subject to such deviations and alterations

by any of the respective powers and authorities hereinbefore mentioned, and to such

other deviations and alterations as we shall by these presents, or by any future

48 | 79

proclamation, and in pursuance of the authorities confided to us, deem it proper

and beneficial for the purposes of justice to ordain and publish, or which shall or

may hereafter be by lawful authority ordained and published.” (Emphasis added.)

Section 3 of the Revised Edition of the Legislative Enactments Act (Chapter I), No. 2 of

1956 has conferred considerable powers on the Commissioner appointed in terms of the

Act to prepare the revised edition and to carryout revision of legislative enactments prior

to their publication. Such powers include the power to (a) omit provisions of statutes

which have been repealed by necessary implication, (b) consolidate into one enactment

any two or more enactments, (c) to incorporate into any enactment any amendment, and

(d) to make such adaptations or amendments to any enactment as may appear to be

necessary or proper, as a consequence of the present political status of Ceylon. Further,

section 12(1)(a) and 12(1)(b) of the Act required the Commissioner to transmit the

completed revised edition (prior to its publication) to the Prime Minister to lay it before

the House of Representatives (Parliament) and to the Minister of Justice to lay it before

the Senate. In terms of Section 12(2), both the House of Representatives and the Senate

were required to pass a Resolution authorizing the publication of the revised edition in

the Gazette. Thus, the procedure provided in the Act tantamounted to the then twin

legislative bodies re-enacting the entire body of written law found in Proclamations,

Ordinances and Acts in force at that time. Section 12(3) of the Revised Edition of the

Legislative Enactments Act provides that, ‘the revised edition shall, on and after the date on

which it comes into force, be deemed to be and be without any question whatsoever in all courts of

justice and for all purposes whatsoever the sole authentic edition of the legislative enactments of

Ceylon therein printed’. Thus, in view of what is evidently an amalgamated, amended and

revised version of the 1799 Proclamation and the 1835 Ordinance being published under

the title ‘Adoption of Roman – Dutch Law’ in the 1956 revised version of the Legislative

Enactments, and in view of section 12(3) of the Revised Edition of the Legislative

Enactments Act, the need to question the authenticity of the texts of the Proclamation of

1799 and the Ordinance of 1835 does not any longer arise. In any event, it is my view that

49 | 79

there is no substantial error in the re-production of the combined effect of the original

Proclamation of 1799 and the Ordinance of 1835 in the 1956 Legislative Enactments. It is

important to note that presently what has the force of law are the contents of the

‘Adoption of Roman – Dutch Law’ Act as contained in the 1956 revised edition of the

Legislative Enactments. Therefore, Courts are obliged to take cognizance of and apply

provisions of the statute as contained in the revised Legislative Enactments (1956).

Thus, it is clear that as it stands now, the law provides for deviations and alterations to

the Roman - Dutch law to be introduced by ‘those who possess legislative power’ and by

other ‘lawful authorities’. This points to the proposition that in addition to Parliament

(which possesses legislative power), Courts of this country are also empowered to adopt

deviations and alterations to the Roman – Dutch law.

Authority conferred on judges of common law legal systems and the adaptation of the

Roman-Dutch law to suit contemporary requirements

It would also be seen that the effect of the Proclamation of 1799 as amended by the

Ordinance of 1835 was the continued recognition and enforceability of the Roman - Dutch

law which had been applied by Dutch institutions of justice of Ceylon as at the time of

the capitulation by the Dutch to the British in 1796, subject to (i) amendments introduced

during the intervening period of 1799 – 1835, and (ii) laws that may have been thereafter

enacted and introduced by those possessing legislative power such as the Parliament,

and by other ‘lawful authorities’.

Whether by the use of the term ‘lawful authority’, in addition to the legislature, judges of

Courts of law who are called upon to administer the Roman - Dutch law also became

empowered to introduce alterations and deviations to the Roman-Dutch law, is a matter

of considerable importance. An answer to this critical question has to be determined

particularly as successive legislatures of this country have left the Roman-Dutch law

uncodified and thus, to-date, remaining in the corpus of the ‘common law’. An answer

50 | 79

to this important question is also linked to the introduction of the ‘common law tradition’

to Ceylon by the British colonizers, and to the recognition accorded in the entire common

law world to the role of the higher judiciary to not only interpret and apply the written

law, but also to adapt and apply the common law to cater to continually changing societal

values, norms, behaviour and expectations and evolving complexities of human

civilization. The need to do so is heightened by the progressive development of rights

and duties, the complexities and intricacies of disputes being presented to Courts and the

expectations of the public and the State that all disputes including complex disputes be

adjudicated fairly, leaving no party genuinely aggrieved by an unlawful act or other

injustice, remediless.

In Sultan v. Peiris [35 NLR 57 at 68] Chief Justice Macdonnell has described the status of

the Roman – Dutch law in the backdrop of personal laws, in the following manner:

“It must be observed that there is no discoverable legislative enactment declaring Roman-

Dutch law to be the general law or the ‘common law’ of the Island. If one went solely by

statutes, one would have to conclude that it was but one among a number of laws in force

in Ceylon. Kandyans, Tamils and Muhammadans are declared each to have their own law,

and if Roman-Dutch law has become the general or (if one may use the term) residuary law

of the Island – a law, that is, which provides (1) for Kandyans, Tamils and Muhammadans

in matters where their own personal law, as received, is silent, and (2) for the other portions

of the community generally – this has been effected by judicial decision, supporting itself

on such statute law as refers to legal terms familiar to Roman-Dutch law. If the Roman-

Dutch law is the residuary law of the Island, as it unquestionably is, it has not been by

reason of positive enactment that this has been effected.”

The situation relating to the Roman-Dutch law did not change following Ceylon gaining

Independence in 1948. The previously referred to legislation titled ‘Adoption of Roman

– Dutch Law’ as found in the Legislative Enactments of 1956 remains in force to-date.

51 | 79

Notwithstanding the continuous shrinking of the scope of the Roman-Dutch law due to

enactment of legislation during the British colonial rule, post-independence era and

during the present Republican era of Sri Lanka, it undoubtedly remains to be the residual

common civil law of this country. Whenever the need arose, the Parliament has enacted

laws with regard to areas which were previously regulated by the Roman-Dutch common

law. Lacuna in the Roman-Dutch law has also been taken cognizance of and filled by

Parliament through legislation. Recovery of Damages for the Death of a Person Act, No.

2 of 2019 serves as a candid example. It seems to have been Parliament’s legislative

response to the situation highlighted in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Priyani

Soyza v. Rienzi Arsecularatne. However, in my opinion, pending such intervention by

Parliament, judges called upon to interpret where necessary and apply the common law,

may apply such common law with suitable adaptations enabling delivery of justice to

aggrieved litigants. It would be undesirable to leave lacuna in the common law, in

expectation of Parliament remedying it. In comparison with identifying and filling lacuna

in the common law, Parliament has other legislative priorities, such as enacting laws to

strengthen the rule of law, democracy and governance, formulating laws pertaining to

national security, regulation of finance, trade and commerce, enacting legislation to

facilitate rapid economic growth, formulating laws to provide social services and benefits

to the needy, enacting enabling national legislation to give effect to Sri Lanka’s

obligations under international law and codifying new prohibitions and stipulating

punishment pertaining to new and advanced manifestations of organized and

sophisticated crime. Thus, it is necessary for the judiciary to take cognizance of lacunas

in the common law, without leaving it to be dealt with by Parliament which is burdened

with other priorities. Further, the vitality of the common law should be retained by the

judiciary by providing necessary interpretations and adaptations to it. Nevertheless, such

adaptations should not cause violence to the fundamental features of the existing

common law. The progressive development of the common law should be gradual and

founded upon existing principles of law. Ideally, such interpretations and adaptations

52 | 79

should be subtle, gradual, incremental, smooth, and left in the hands of the higher

judiciary.

As aptly put by L.J.M. Cooray, in “An Introduction to the Legal System of Ceylon” (1972,

page 180), “The judges should not seek to restrict in any way or frustrate the policies contained

in statutes passed by the supreme legislative authority. But this does not mean that there is no

scope for judicial activism. … judicial activism would be welcome in those areas where the

legislature has not the time nor the inclination to legislate. In a modern democracy, the time of the

legislature is generally consumed by the regulation of national economic policy, the provision of

educational, social and welfare services, defence and internal security. Matters of private law (civil

procedure, the law of persons, property, succession, contracts and torts) and even areas of state

concern such as criminal law and criminal procedure tend to suffer neglect in such an atmosphere.

… Thus, in areas where the legislature shows no inclination to effect necessary changes the

judiciary could adopt a more positive role to develop the law, overruling decisions which are wrong

or not in keeping with notions of justice and equity, changing conditions or the circumstances of

modern life. In this way the courts can be of assistance to the legislature by alleviating some of the

pressures on it. Thirdly, in those areas not controlled by statute but which are common law areas,

there is legitimate scope for judicial law-making.”

Due to multiple reasons, the purity of Roman-Dutch law in this country has also been

affected over a long period of time. In Korossa Rubber Company v. Silva et. al. [20 NLR 65

at 74-75] Chief Justice Wood Renton has made the following observation:

“It is well settled that the Roman-Dutch law, pure and simple, does not exist in this

country in its entirety. It has been modified in many directions, both expressly and by

necessary implication, by our statute law, and also by judicial decisions. The

defendants’ counsel admitted, what could not indeed be denied, that the Roman-Dutch law

in Ceylon had been on some points not merely repealed, but impliedly affected by local

enactments (see Rabot v. De Silva). But they challenged the proposition that the Roman-

53 | 79

Dutch law had been or could be abrogated or modified by the action of the Courts. The fact

that this has been done is, however, incontestable, and the process has not been

confined to this Colony.” (Emphasis added.)

Walter Pereira on “The Laws of Ceylon”, at page 12, has observed that, “The whole of the

Dutch Law as it prevailed in Holland more than a century ago was never bodily imported into this

country. We have only adopted and acted upon so much of it as suited our circumstances, such as

the Law of Inheritance in the Maritime Provinces, Community of Property, Law of Mortgage and

so forth…”

Furthermore, as seen in Suppramania Chetty et. al. v The Fiscal, Western Province [(1916) 19

NLR 129], Attorney–General v Smith [(1908) 11 NLR 126], Parmsoty v Veenayagamoorthy et.

al. [(1943) 44 NLR 361], Wije Bus Co. Ltd. v Soysa [(1948) 50 NLR 350], Kaluwalage Champika

Kumari De Silva v Kodithuwakku Arachchige Neville Kodithuwakku and others [SC Appeal No.

172/2012], and General Manager of Railways and another v Bhadra De Silva Rajakaruna and

others [SC Appeal No. 62/2013], disputes that could have necessarily been adjudicated

upon by the application of principles of delictual liability contained in the Roman-Dutch

law, have been decided upon by the application of principles of tortious liability under

the English law on Torts. Thus, it appears that the English law on Torts has co-existed

side by side with the Roman-Dutch law on Delicts. Furthermore, there is ample evidence

in judgments, that show that certain legal principles essentially borrowed from English

Tort law, such as the principle of ‘Strict Liability’ in the celebrated case of Fletcher v.

Rylands, have been incorporated into Sri Lankan law.

Therefore, it is not possible to subscribe to the view that in Sri Lanka, delictual disputes

remain in the exclusive domain of the original and pure Roman-Dutch law. Thus,

applying the original and pure theoretical principles of the Lex Aquilia to the instant

matter would be neither possible nor necessary.

54 | 79

In C. Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney-General, [72 NLR 337, at 342], (in one of the last

judgments pronounced by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, which was during

that period, the court of last resort for cases from Ceylon), arising out of an Appeal from

the Supreme Court of Ceylon, on 11th December 1969, Lord Diplock expressing his

opinion on behalf of the Privy Council, has adverted to the following regarding the

Roman-Dutch law:

“… although the Roman-Dutch law as applied in Ceylon under the Government of the

United Provinces is the starting point of the “common law” of Ceylon, it is not the

finishing point. Like the common law of England, the common law of Ceylon has not

remained static since 1799. In course of time, it has been the subject of progressive

development by a cursus curiae (Samed v. Segutamby) as the Courts of Ceylon have applied

its basic principles to the solution of legal problems posed by the changing conditions of

society in Ceylon. In their Lordships’ view, if long established judicial authority for a

proposition of law not inconsistent with the British constitutional concept of the exercise

of sovereign authority by the Crown can be found in the decisions of the Ceylon courts

themselves, there is no need to go back to see whether any precedent can be found for it in

the jurisprudence of the Courts of the United Provinces or the doctrine of the Roman-Dutch

jurists of the eighteenth century. Still less is it necessary to find a precedent for it in English

common law. The absence of any supporting precedent for the proposition in Roman-Dutch

law, as applied in the United Provinces, may be due to a number of reasons. It may have

been “taken for granted” law in the United Provinces or it may deal with circumstances

which did not exist there or did not attract the attention of writers on Roman-Dutch law

in the eighteenth century ; or it may be a development of the common law of Ceylon itself

either before or after 1799, of which the nascence and growth may be impossible to trace in

the absence of any reports of decisions before 1833 and very incomplete reports thereafter

until towards the end of the nineteenth century. Even a clear conflicting precedent in the

eighteenth century jurisprudence or doctrines of the United Provinces would not

necessarily be a conclusive indication that a later decision of a Ceylon court is erroneous.

As Wood Renton J. pointed out in Colombo Electric Tramway Co. v. Attorney-General

little is known as to the precise extent to which the doctrines of Roman-Dutch law which

55 | 79

were applied in the United Provinces themselves were actually introduced into Ceylon

while it was under Dutch rule, and if authority were found in the eighteenth century law

of the United Provinces which was inconsistent with an old-established line of decisions by

the Courts of Ceylon, the inference may well be that the authority relates to a part of the

law of the United Provinces which was regarded as unsuitable to conditions in Ceylon and

was never introduced there.”

A view contrary to the above-stated view of Lord Diplock is found in the judgment of

Chief Justice H.N.G. Fernando in Lily M. De Costa v. Bank of Ceylon [72 NLR 457],

pronounced on 18th December 1969, merely seven days after Lord Diplock pronounced

the afore-stated opinion in C. Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney-General. The judgment of

Chief Justice H.N.G. Fernando does not refer to the opinion of Lord Diplock in

Kodeeswaran v Attorney-General. It is quite possible that in view of the circumstances that

prevailed then, Chief Justice Fernando may not have been aware of the opinion contained

in the judgment of the Privy Council in Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney-General. In view of

the structure and hierarchy of courts of that era and the doctrine of Stare Decisis, the

Supreme Court of Ceylon was bound at that time to follow the ratio decidendi of judgments

of the Privy Council. In the circumstances, with due respect to the views contained in the

judgment of former Chief Justice H.N.G. Fernando and to the high authority of the views

of His Lordship, I must respectfully express my inclination to hold the opinion that (a)

the views of Lord Diplock as regards the status of the Roman-Dutch law in the common

law of this country reflect the correct position of the law, and (b) the proposition that

deviations and alterations to the Roman-Dutch common law may be introduced through

non-legislative means, such as by judgments of superior Courts, is lawful and hence

correct.

Commenting on the status of the Roman-Dutch law during the British colonial era and

thereafter, Professor Nadaraja has highlighted the impact of numerous statutes

introduced by the legislature and their impact on the Roman-Dutch common law of this

56 | 79

country. He has cited a series of statues which caused a significant erosion of the scope

of the Roman-Dutch law. Referring to the impact of judgments of superior courts,

Professor Nadaraja has stated the following (page 240 - 243):

“We must now turn to the development of the law by the decisions of the courts or what is

not inaptly called ‘judge-made law’. The courts have recognized that “differences of time

and place are to be attended to: and a rule that might have worked very well in the old

European country of Holland at the time when Voet wrote (in the seventeenth century)

might work very badly in modern Ceylon”. Accordingly, rules and institutions of the

Roman-Dutch law have been declared inapplicable in Ceylon on various grounds, which

can be classified under two main heads. First, rules have not been applied in Ceylon where

they were of purely local application in some part of the Netherlands or were so closely

implicated with local conditions there, as not to be capable of adaptation to the

circumstances of Ceylon. … Secondly, rules of the Roman-Dutch law have been discarded

by the courts when they were out of harmony with the conditions of modern life, in

accordance with the principle that when the reason for a rule of law ceases to operate, the

rule itself ceases to have effect (cessante ratione legis cessant lex ipsa). … Although the

courts have thus declared some principles in the old books to be inapplicable in the

conditions of modern Ceylon, they have also tried on occasions to adapt other principles to

changed circumstances of time and place. They have recognized that they ‘are

administering not a dead but a living system of law’ and that such adaptations is necessary

‘in the ordinary course of development of our colonial law to overtake the circumstances of

modern life’. Consequently, the courts have stated that they were ‘entitled to develop the

legal principles handed down [from the Roman and the Roman-Dutch law] in connection

with new situations which arise in our own civilization’; and, since the courts have been

faced with the duty of declaring the terms of the law contained in the old books, they have

also been able sometimes to explain that the law in consonance with modern ideas, often

‘by a process of commenting upon the [Dutch] commentators’. … The Judicial Committee

of the Privy Council has remarked that the Roman-Dutch Law was ‘a virile, living

system of law, ever seeking to adapt itself consistently with its inherent basic

57 | 79

principles to deal effectively with the increasing complexities of modern organized

society. Clearly, however, there were limits to this adaptability; for the courts have

declared themselves to be ‘powerless to alter the basic principles themselves, or to introduce

by ‘judicial legislation’ fundamental changes in the established elements of an existing

cause of action’ as laid down by the Roman-Dutch Law’. Consequently, where the Roman-

Dutch Law was deemed inadequate to supply answers to all the complicated problems that

arise in modern life, the courts have turned to the English Law.”

In The Government Agent, Central Province v. Letchiman Chetty et al (24 NLR 36) Chief

Justice Bertram referring to the application of the Roman-Dutch law has held as follows:

“In my opinion this development of the law should be welcomed, and the present case

should be treated as coming within the principles laid down. … We are, I think, entitled to

develop the legal principles handed down to us in connection with new situations which

arise in our own civilization. The tests which were taken as determining tests under the

Roman law are not always justly applicable as determining tests in the various

combinations of fact, which from time to time, present themselves in modern life. The

principle involved was originally an equitable principle, and it is more in accordance with

the spirit of that principle that we should administer it equitably rather than upon strictly

rigorous lines. … ”

It would thus be seen that particularly since the Roman-Dutch law remains in the

domain of the ‘common law’ of Sri Lanka, it has been possible for judges of apex courts

to interpret and apply it subject at time to suitable adaptations to suit contemporary

conditions of life in Sri Lanka, complexities of modern human behaviour and social

norms. Such adaptations of the Roman-Dutch law on the one hand ensure that the

Roman-Dutch law does not fall into disuse and become obsolete, and would remain in

par in its vitality and dynamism with contemporary developments in other bodies of law,

such as human rights law. On the other hand, and more importantly, it ensures the

58 | 79

delivery of justice to those who have encountered injustices due to the infringement of

their rights or suffered harm due to unlawful conduct.

Adam Geary, Wayne Morrison and Robert Jago in “The Politics of the Common Law” (2nd

edition, at page 138), discuss the boundaries of judicial law-making and the relationship

between the legislature and the judiciary. Commencing with Lord Scarman’s speech in

McLoughlin v O’Brian [(1983) 1 AC 410] the following has been observed:

“Lord Scarman argued that the judge had a jurisdiction over a common law that ‘knows

no gaps’ and ‘no casus omissus’. If this is the case, the task of the common law judge is to

adapt the principles of the law to allow a decision to be made on the facts in hand. This may

involve the creation of new law. Whatever the case, judicial reasoning begins from a

‘baseline of existing principle’. The judge works towards a solution that can be seen as an

extension of principle by process of analogy. For Lord Scarman, this is the ‘distinguishing

feature of the common law’: the judicial creation of new law, as the justice of the case

demands. This process may involve policy considerations, but the judge can legitimately

involve him / herself in this activity, provided that the primary outcome is the formation of

new legal principles. In those cases, where the formation of principle involves too great an

intrusion into the field of policy, the judge must defer to Parliament:

“Here lies the true role of the two law-making institutions in our Constitution. By

concentrating on principle, the judges can keep the common law alive, flexible and

consistent, and can keep the legal system clear of policy problems which neither they, nor

the forensic process which it is their duty to operate, are equipped to resolve. If principle

leads to results which are thought to be socially unacceptable, Parliament can legislate to

draw a line or map out a new path.”

“The real risk to the common law is not its movement to cover new situations and new

knowledge, but lest it should stand still, halted by a conservative judicial approach. If that

should happen, and since the 1966 practice direction of the House it has become less likely,

59 | 79

there would be a danger of the law becoming irrelevant to the consideration, and inept in

its treatment, of modern social problems. Justice would be defeated. The common law has,

however, avoided this catastrophe by the flexibility given by generations of judges.”

“…It is a description of the common law judge as the guardian of the conscience of the

common law. The judge is charged with the development of the law in such a way that its

principles remain coherent as it develops and adapts itself to changing social conditions.

Thus, the flexibility of the common law is an element of what makes it just. However, things

are somewhat more complicated. Flexibility is inseparable from the ‘risk’ of ‘uncertainty in

the law’. This risk varies with the context of the legal problem under consideration. In other

words, problems of uncertainty take a different form in areas of ‘commercial transaction’

and ‘tortious liability for personal injuries’. Returning to the issue of justice, Lord Scarman

argues that justice can demand a degree of loss of certainty in the law… However, the law

has to respond to advances in ‘medical science’ and technology, and adapt the relevant text

for foreseeability.”

Justice Gratiaen in Chissel v. R.C. Chapman [56 NLR 121 at 127] has held that, “In England,

“less timourous” common law judges sometimes find themselves free to invent a new cause of

action to meet a new situation (if the problem is unembarrassed by binding precedent). But those

of us who administer Roman-Dutch law cannot disregard its basic principles although (on

grounds of public policy or expediency) we may cautiously attempt to adapt them to fresh

situations arising from the complex conditions of modern society. But we are powerless to

alter the basic principles themselves, or introduce by “judicial legislation” fundamental changes

in the established elements of an existing cause of action.” (Emphasis added.)

Those who advocate a conservative and narrow approach to the exercise of judicial power

by common law judges insist that the role of judges should be limited to interpreting and

applying the law as it is. Adaptation of the existing law to suit contemporary

requirements, filling lacuna of existing law through such adaptations, and by these means

60 | 79

developing the law through the pronouncement of progressive judgments is seen by

some as ‘judicial activism’ and castigated as ‘judicial legislation’ or ‘judge made law’ which

they allege amounts to usurpation of the legislative power of Parliament and an

infringement of the rule of law. I find myself unable to accept that point of view regarding

the role of common law judges pertaining to the common law. The common law is

vibrant, flexible and accommodates the ever-changing demands of contemporary human

civilization, evolving human conduct and norms and collective values of society. If the

common law remained static without evolving and developing with the passage of time,

unwritten law would have gone into oblivion long time ago. The growth of the common

law in fact depends upon judicial activism. If judicial activism reflected in progressive

judgments (a) do not impinge on the written law, (b) does not cause an erosion of the core

legal principles found in the common law, (c) do not violate legislation and obstruct

legislative intent, (e) are in public interest and (f) are orchestrated towards the delivery

of justice, such judgments must be recognized as manifestations of proper and

meaningful exercise of judicial power. Such judgments would in my view be very much

in compliance with Article 4(c) of the Constitution.

It is necessary to observe that, the Lex Aquilia had been originally promulgated to suit a

totally different socio-cultural, religious, political and economic environment. The stark

difference is exemplified by the fact that the Lex Aquilia was promulgated during an era

where a group of human beings were classified as slaves and slaves recognized as

‘property’. Since the promulgation of the Lex Aquilia, human civilization has undergone

revolutionary and progressive changes in virtually all components of human life.

Conferment of equality and other rights and parity of status to all human beings is the

starting point of that revolution. Human norms, values, needs, relationships, and the law,

have all undergone significant changes; some norms and legal concepts gone into

oblivion; new legal principles such as human rights born, new laws formulated to suit

changing needs and circumstances of communities of human beings and the existing law

adapted to suit contemporary requirements of human society. In such a totally different

61 | 79

and continuingly evolving era of human civilization, the insistence on the application of

the original principles of the Lex Aquilia raises many concerns and difficulties pertaining

to the administration and delivery of justice.

It appears that Parliament having refrained from codifying the residual common-law of

Sri Lanka, has been due to its appreciation that the judiciary is ideally suited to interpret

and adapt the ancient Roman-Dutch law to suit contemporary and evolving requirements

of society, and thereby ensure the delivery of justice to litigants. Rather than insisting on

the theoretical and strict compliance with and the application of the original Lex Aquilia

promulgated over a millennia ago, it is more important to administer justice in a just and

equitable manner, while of course adhering to the fundamental and core principles of the

Roman-Dutch law. In a vibrant and efficacious legal system, the common law should not

remain stagnant as water in a clogged drain. Rather, the common law should flow

retaining its vitality, like fresh water in a stream, gradually evolving through the ever-

changing landscape. Gradual and incremental development of the common law is within

the legitimate exercise of judicial power by Courts which have been called upon to

exercise such power on behalf of the people to the extent empowered by the Constitution

and other laws enacted by Parliament. Such development of the Common law by the

judiciary augurs well for the administration and delivery of justice and is in public

interest. In the circumstances, it is my view that the role of the judiciary cannot and

should not be limited to merely ‘ironing out the creases’ of the old Roman-Dutch law. While

recognizing the need to respect the prerogative of Parliament to effect structural changes

to the Roman-Dutch law and the supreme duty of Courts to uphold the rule of law, I

would with the greatest humility pronounce that it is well within the judicial power of

Courts to interpret, adapt where necessary and apply the Roman-Dutch law to suit

contemporary requirements of modern human society and societal expectations, and

thereby deliver justice to litigants.

62 | 79

In this regard, I am reminded of Chief Justice Hema Basnayake’s views in Bandahamy v

Senanayake [62 NLR 313, at 350], wherein he said that “Law, like other things, is not static

and rigid adherence to previous views even when they are out of place and cannot be reconciled

with modern legal concepts does not foster development of legal thought.”

Furthermore, quite independent of the possible argument that can be propounded

regarding the illegitimacy of the ‘Promulgation of 1799’ introduced by the British colonial

rulers (to whom in 1796 the previous colonial rulers had capitulated the maritime

provinces), in my view, the ‘law’ introduced for the ‘temporary administration of justice

and police in the settlements of the island of Ceylon’ cannot impose restrictions on the

present judiciary of Sri Lanka in the exercise of the judicial power conferred on Courts by

the Constitution and other applicable laws enacted by Parliament, for the purpose of

exercising judicial power on behalf of the people of this country who are collectively

sovereign of the Republic.

In view of the foregoing, I hold that the interpretation and adaptation of the common

law and cautious application of such interpreted and adapted principles of the

unwritten law (in this instance the Roman-Dutch common law) to suit contemporary

complex requirements of modern society, are within the ambit of the legitimate

exercise of judicial power by Courts as contemplated in Article 4(c) of the Constitution.

Nevertheless, any adaptations of the common law including the Roman-Dutch law

should not be inconsistent with (a) fundamental and core principles and features of

the applicable common law, (b) provisions of written law enacted by Parliament, (c)

should be in public interest, and (d) should ensure proper administration and the

delivery of justice.

Application of the Lex Aquilia to the evidence in the case

It is now necessary to revert to the evidence, the attendant circumstances and to the

application of the Lex Aquilia to such evidence and attendant circumstances.

63 | 79

As pointed out earlier, learned Senior DSG quite rightly did not dispute that the 1st

Appellant and the 2nd and 3rd Appellants through the 1st Appellant, had a legal duty of

care towards the Respondent. His position was that (i) the 1st Appellant had not

conducted himself in a negligent manner, (ii) the 1st Appellant was not in breach of the

duty of care he had towards the Respondent, and (iii) in the alternative, if this Court were

to conclude that the 1st Appellant was culpable, the Respondent was only entitled to

receive nominal damages (as opposed to general damages).

The 2nd Appellant derives the power to conduct public examinations such as the G.C.E.

(A/L) examination from the Public Examinations Act. The functions associated with the

conduct of such public examinations are both official and public in nature. Such powers

are conferred by law, and are exercised by public officials on behalf of the public, as

trustees of the public. In this instance, the powers that are necessary for the conduct of

public examinations are conferred on officials conducting examinations, by the Public

Examinations Act. The conduct of public examinations is of crucial importance to the

public at large, the State, and to candidates in particular. Third parties such as higher

educational institutions and employers who wish to ascertain the knowledge and

competence of candidates who face such public examinations, also rely on examination

results released by the 2nd Appellant. The results that candidates receive at public

examinations such as the G.C.E. (A/L), generally has a considerable impact on their entire

future. While such examinations must be conducted with integrity and results released

to a high degree of accuracy, it is an implied duty contained in the governing law, that

examination officials conduct themselves (a) with necessary competency and skill, (b) in

accordance with the Rules promulgated in that regard, (c) to a high degree of

transparency, (d) with due diligence, and (e) to a high standard of care towards

candidates. These are positive legal duties that are imposed by law on persons holding

public office and called upon to perform official functions relating to the conduct of

public examinations which have a bearing on the legitimate interests of members of the

64 | 79

public and in particular, examination candidates. It is the view of this Court that when

conducting public examinations such as the G.C.E. (A/L) examination, officials have an

implied legal duty of care towards candidates who are entitled to sit for such

examination. That is over and above the delictual obligation officials have towards

candidates.

The extent and degree of care that is required, is proportional to the possible harm that

would be caused if such care is not exercised. When a candidate shows interest and

willingness on his part to sit for a certain examination paper in respect of which he has

gained admission, the relevant examination officials are obliged by law to take necessary

and reasonably possible measures to facilitate such candidate to present himself for the

examination. Thus, on 28th August 2001, the 1st Appellant had a legal duty of care towards

the Respondent to facilitate her to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper. In the

circumstances of this case, that legal duty of care required him to take prudent,

reasonable, necessary and feasible measures that were in fact possible under the given

circumstances to have been taken, to ensure that the Respondent received an opportunity

to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper. Any derogation from that standard

would render the conduct of the 1st Appellant in his capacity as the Chief Invigilator

impeachable.

As determined by the learned District Judge and the learned High Court Judge and as

analyzed by me above, the 1st Appellant has failed through his negligent conduct to take

such measures as amounting to the legal duty of care he owed towards the Respondent.

It appears that his negligence commenced when the desks used by candidates to answer

examination papers were re-arranged prior to the ‘General English’ examination paper.

His negligence continued when he neither checked the ‘attendance sheet’ (which should

have necessarily contained the entitlement of the Respondent to sit for the ‘General

English’ examination paper) and when he did not promptly respond to the issue

confronted by the Respondent, by examining the Respondent’s ‘admission card’ which

65 | 79

was in his official custody. The 1st Appellant having called upon the Respondent to

produce the ‘timetable’ and when she failed to do so, having asked her to go home and

bring it to the examination centre, was also a grossly negligent act. As pointed out above,

the 1st Appellant’s conduct falls short of the standard expected of a Chief-Invigilator who

is required to conduct himself in a lawful, diligent, reasonable and prudent manner. Even

if this Court were to conclude that the version of events as testified to by the 1st Appellant

is true, he could have easily provided a timely opportunity for the Respondent to sit for

Part I of the ‘General English’ examination paper, while and parallel to his performing

the purported ‘priority responsibility’ of distributing the examination papers to the four

Invigilators. The 1st Appellant has conducted himself in callous disregard of the

legitimate entitlement of the Respondent to sit for the ‘General English’ examination

paper. In the circumstances of this case, I conclude that a reasonable and prudent Chief –

Invigilator in the circumstances confronted by the 1st Appellant on the morning of the

28th of August 2001, would not have conducted himself in the manner he did. Thus, the

impugned conduct of the 1st Appellant must necessarily be classified as amounting to

negligent conduct, and a breach of the legal duty of care he had towards the Respondent.

Furthermore, had the 1st Appellant facilitated the Respondent to sit for Part I of the

General English examination paper, she would not have missed sitting for Part II of the

same paper. Thus, I conclude that it was the negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant in

breach of the legal duty of care he had towards the Respondent vested in him by law in

his capacity as the Chief Invigilator, that resulted in the Respondent losing the

opportunity to sit for Parts I and II of the ‘General English’ examination paper of the

G.C.E. (A/L) examination held in August 2001. Thus, I conclude that the conduct of the

1st Appellant was negligent and that such negligent conduct is actionable. In my opinion,

‘culpa’ should necessarily be attributed to the conduct of the 1st Appellant. Through the

negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant, he has breached the legal right of the Respondent

to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper.

Professor R.G. McKerron (at page 51) has expressed the general view that in the Lex Aqulia

the plaintiff must prove that the act complained of caused him ‘damnum’ – that is,

patrimonial loss. He has opined that by ‘damnum’, what is meant is not damage to a thing,

but pecuniary loss, either accrued or prospective to the person injured. That would take

the form of loss in respect of property, business, or prospective gains, capable of

pecuniary assessment. He has emphasized that an important exception to this general

rule is the award of compensation for pain and suffering in an action for personal injuries.

However, in his opinion, where there has not been any physical injuries or illness,

compensation in the form of general damages is not recoverable in an action under the

Lex Aquilia for mere mental distress or wounded feelings.

As pointed out by learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General, it has been held by Justice

Dheeraratne in Prof. Priyani Soyza v. Rienzie Arsecularatne [(2001) 2 Sri L.R. 293] that

the compensation recoverable under the Lex Aquilia is only for patrimonial damages, that

is, loss in respect of property, business, or prospective gains. Justice Dheeraratne quoting

Professor de Villers with approval, has expressed the view that there is a distinction

between actions for injuria (where the intent is of essence) and actions founded upon culpa

alone. He has expressed the view that in the former case, compensation might be awarded

by way of satisfaction for injured feelings. In the latter, all that could be claimed is for

patrimonial damage, which should be explicitly and specifically proved. Damages

claimed by a plaintiff under the head of mental shock, appear to be recoverable under

Roman Dutch law (if the test of reasonable foreseeability is satisfied), only if that results

in psychiatric illness. Damages on account of emotional shock of short duration, which

has no substantial effect on the health of a person are not recoverable. The award of

compensation for physical pain caused to a person injured through negligence, which is

recognized by the Law of Holland, constitutes a notable exception to the rule in question.

However, according to Justice Dheeraratne, there is no warrant for any such exception in

the case of mental distress or wounded feelings which has not caused any physical injury.

Damages calculated on that basis are wholly outside the scope of the Aquilian procedure.

67 | 79

Justice Dheeraratne has expressed the view that compensation for injured feelings arising

out of and flowing naturally only from physical hurt inflicted, could be claimed under

the Lex Aquilia. Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General relied heavily on this

pronouncement to support his contention that the Respondent is not entitled to receive

general damages.

In the South African case of Union Government (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v.

Warneke [(1911) South African Law Reports 657] Chief Justice Lord De Villiers citing Voet

has held that, “… whatever may have been the practice under the Roman law, it is clear that

under the Dutch law the practice was to confine the damages claimable by the Aquilian action to

cases in which a calculable pecuniary loss has been actually sustained.”

Thus, it is evident that in the original and conventional sense of the Lex Aquilia, damages

can be awarded only if the loss suffered by the plaintiff occasioned as a result of the

breach of a duty of care by the defendant, had resulted in damnum – that is patrimonial

loss and is capable of pecuniary (financial) assessment. It thus seems that the award of

damages claimable in an Aquilian action is generally confined only to situations where

there is calculable pecuniary loss. The pecuniary loss should be proved by the Plaintiff.

However, it is important to note that, in the Roman-Dutch law as it stands today, there

are certain well recognized exceptions to the norm that ensuing patrimonial loss must be

proved to enable a Court to grant damages. These exceptions are as follows:

(i) Situations where actionable negligence has caused physical injury to the victim

resulting in psychological trauma. (See “The Law of Delict” by R.G. McKerron,

at page 51) In this situation, notwithstanding the Plaintiff being unable to

establish patrimonial loss, he is entitled to general damages due to both the

physical injury as well as psychological trauma;

68 | 79

(ii) Situations where a legally recognized right of the Plaintiff has been infringed

by its breach or denial, as a result of actionable negligence by the Defendant. If

the purpose of instituting action was primarily to establish that a right had

been infringed by the Defendant and not necessarily to obtain compensation,

notwithstanding the Plaintiff being unable to establish patrimonial loss, the

Plaintiff will be entitled to nominal damages.

In this regard, I find support in the following paragraph found at page 52 in

“The Law of Delict” by R.G. McKerron:

“In the modern law there is another exception to the rule that patrimonial loss must be

proved, namely, where the real purpose of the action is not to obtain compensation for

harm done, but to establish some right which is denied or disputed by the defendant. In

such a case, if the plaintiff establishes his right, he is entitled to nominal damages,

although he proves no loss. The leading authority for this departure from the rule is

Edwards v. Hyde. In that case, Solomon J. said “There are many cases where, though

in form, the action is one for damages, it is really brought to substantiate and establish

some right, and if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing his right, though he proves no

damages, he has substantially succeeded in his action, and the court is, therefore, bound

to give judgment in his favour for nominal damages.” But a mere infringement, not

involving a denial, of the plaintiff’s rights is not, as might be inferred from the

judgment of Sheil J. in Lord v. Gillwald, sufficient to justify an award of nominal

damages in our law.”

This position is supported by H.W. Tambiah in “Principles of Ceylon Law” (page

397).

(iii) Situations where the actionable negligent conduct of the Defendant is

deplorable in nature due to its attendant circumstances and is associated with

an element of grossly aberrant conduct and must therefore be condemned. In

such situations, notwithstanding the Plaintiff being unable to establish

69 | 79

patrimonial loss, he would be entitled to exemplary damages that are nominal

in nature.

R.G. McKerron in “The Law of Delict” (page 113) states as follows:

Exemplary damages, that is, damages awarded to punish the defendant in an exemplary

manner, may be regarded as a species of moral or sentimental damages. The award of

exemplary damages is justified where the defendant’s conduct involves an element of

injuria; where for example, the defendant has been guilty of high-handed, insolent,

vindictive or malicious conduct.

However, the question that remains to be answered is whether, in the circumstances of

this case, the Plaintiff (Respondent) would be entitled to receive general damages due to

(i) the psychological trauma and ensuing suffering sustained by her due to actionable

negligence on the part of the 1st Defendant (1st Appellant), and (ii) in view of the possible

prospective loss that she may incur in the future due to not having passed the ‘General

English’ examination paper of the August 2001 G.C.E. (A/L) Examination.

Particularly in view of contemporary scientific understanding of the impact and far-

reaching consequences of psychological injury and associated pain and suffering which

scientists have opined far exceed in gravity in comparison with harm arising out of most

physical injuries, serious consideration must be given to the anomaly and injustice arising

out of victims of physical injuries who have suffered mental pain (psychological trauma)

being entitled to receive general damages and those who have only suffered

psychological injury (without having sustained physical injuries or suffered from

psychiatric illness) not being entitled to receive general damages. Should not victims who

have only suffered psychological trauma also be entitled to a solatium in the form of

sentimental general damages? If the Lex Aquilia is applied in the afore-stated original

narrow premise, victims who have suffered serious psychological trauma resulting from

actionable negligence on the part of the wrongdoer in the backdrop of the existence of a

70 | 79

duty of care and a breach of such duty (as in this case), fall into a substantial remediless

situation.

Dr. Shivaji Felix, in an article published in 2001 to the Law Society Trust Review (Part II,

160, at page 1-23), titled “Of Snakes and Ladders – One down for the Roman-Dutch law: One

up for the Medical Profession”, has analysed the law and in my view rightly concluded as

follows:

“A person should not be allowed to suffer a wrong without a remedy. The Roman law was never

an unreasonable system of law. It offered victims of wrongdoing a wide spectrum of remedies. The

modern Roman-Dutch law must also keep abreast with the changing social ethos. …

Consequently, the law of negligence must progress and cannot be locked in a time capsule of 1799.”

It is my considered opinion that the duty of judges is to mold and evolve the common

law through (a) identification of the correct law, (b) interpreting terms that require

interpretation, (c) making adaptations where doing so is necessary so as to make the law

more sensitive and responsive to complexities of contemporary human civilization and

complex disputes being presented to Courts and (d) thereby ensure the delivery of justice

inter-alia to those who have suffered due to transgressions of the law and suffered

injustice and harm.

Thus, with the view to providing relief to victims of actionable negligence who have

suffered psychological trauma and associated pain of mind, without causing violence

to the fundamental principles of law governing the Lex Aquilia, it is my view that

justice must be served by the law being adapted and enforced to cater to contemporary

requirements of the administration of justice and applied in a manner to enable such

victims of psychological trauma to be able to obtain general (or real) damages in the

form of a solatium. This situation then would serve as the fourth exception to the

requirement that patrimonial loss ensuing from actionable negligence should be

proved by the claimant.

Award of Damages

In view of the extensive reliance by both the learned Senior DSG for the Appellants and

the Counsel for the Respondent on Professor R.G. McKerron’s views regarding the award

of damages, it is necessary to place his views in the correct context, by reproducing his

views on this matter to some degree of detail.

“The damages recoverable for a delict are either real or nominal. Damages are said to be real

where they are awarded as compensation for actual loss suffered. If it is clear that some loss

has been suffered, however small or difficult of assessment it may be, the damages

awarded in respect of it are real and not nominal. Damages are said to be nominal where

they are awarded not by way of compensation for any actual loss suffered, but merely

by way of recognition of some legal right vested in the plaintiff and violated by the

defendant. The only case in which nominal damages in the strict sense will be awarded in our law

is where the action, though in the form an action for damages founded on delict, is really brought

to establish some right, and the plaintiff establishes his right, but does not prove any actual loss.

Since nominal damages are not awarded for the purpose of compensating the plaintiff, they never

exceed a small sum of money; for example, five rand.

Damages are also distinguishable as being either sentimental or patrimonial. Sentimental damages

are damages awarded as a solatium for wounded feelings or for mental pain or suffering. As a

general rule, sentimental damages will not be awarded unless the wrong complained of constitutes

an injuria. Patrimonial damages, on the other hand, are damages awarded as compensation for

calculable pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the wrong complained of.

Damages are further distinguishable as being either general or special. General damages are

awarded as compensation for general damage; special damages as compensation for special damage.

This distinction, more particularly in our law as distinguished from English law, belongs rather

to the law of pleading and procedure than to the substantive law. General damage is such loss as

the law will presume to be a natural or probable consequence of the defendant’s act. Special damage,

72 | 79

on the other hand, is loss which arises out of the special circumstances of the case and which will

therefore not be presumed. Since general damage is presumed, it is sufficient to allege it generally,

and the defendant is not entitled to demand particulars of it. Special damage, on the other hand,

not being presumed, must be specifically alleged and claimed, so that the defendant may have due

notice of the nature of the claim; otherwise, the plaintiff will not be entitled to lead evidence of it

at the trial.

In English law general damage is held to arise by inference of law, and need not be specifically

established by evidence. But in our law, except where the wrong complained of is an injuria,

damages are not as a rule recoverable unless damage, actual or prospective, is proved to have been

suffered. As has been pointed out, therefore, we must be careful how we use the terms, ‘general

damages’ and ‘special damages’ in our practice.

Unless the wrong complained of constitutes an injuria, or the action is brought to establish a

right, the rule is that the plaintiff is only entitled to damages in respect of such calculable

pecuniary loss as he can prove that he has actually sustained or is likely to sustain. But, it is to

be observed that a court is not justified in refusing to award the plaintiff damages,

merely because the quantum is difficult of assessment. If it is clear that the plaintiff has

sustained, or will sustain, damage, and the best evidence available as to the amount

thereof has been produced, the court must do the best it can, on the evidence before it, or

assess the damages to which he is entitled.

Where the plaintiff has only one cause of action, the rule is that damages must be awarded once

and for all in a single action. Judgment in the action first brought will bar further action arising

from the same cause. Prospective damage – that is, damage which in the ordinary course is likely

to accrue – as well as damage which has actually accrued should therefore be included by the

plaintiff in his claim. But, it is different where the plaintiff has two or more distinct causes of

action. Thus, if the act complained of is not a complete and finished act causing damage once and

for all, but a continuing wrong causing fresh damage from day to day, the plaintiff has more than

one cause of action, and can therefore bring a second action in respect of damage sustained after

73 | 79

the first action. Similarly, if the removal of lateral support causes more than one subsidence an

action will lie in respect of each subsidence, because each subsidence gives a new cause of action.”

(Emphasis added by me.)

Entitlement of the Plaintiff to nominal damages due to infringement of a right - As I

have pointed out earlier, the Respondent has established that the 1st Appellant conducted

himself towards the Respondent in a negligent manner. He did so, in the backdrop of

having a legal duty of care towards the Respondent, a duty which he breached, resulting

in the Respondent not being able to sit for the ‘General English’ examination paper. This

was in the backdrop of the Respondent having the legal right to sit for the ‘General

English’ examination paper. Due to the negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant, the

Respondent was denied her right to secure an examination-based assessment of her

competency of ‘General English’ at the August 2001 G.C.E. (A/L) Examination and also

the right to qualify in that subject. Thus, those legal rights of the Respondent have been

breached by the 1st Appellant. Therefore, the universitas of the rights of the Respondent

have been adversely affected by the negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant. In

contemporary society, legal rights cannot be limited to interests in corporeal property.

The impact of the infringement of a legal right cannot necessarily be linked to patrimonial

loss. The absence of patrimonial loss makes the infringement not less important to the

victim or to society. Thus, the need arises to provide relief to a victim whose rights have

been infringed even though such infringement may not have resulted in any calculable

patrimonial loss. As pointed out earlier, when a right has been infringed due to actionable

negligence of the Defendant, the Plaintiff is entitled to receive nominal damages. Thus, I

hold that the Plaintiff (Respondent) is entitled to receive from the Defendants

(Appellants) nominal damages.

Entitlement of the Plaintiff to exemplary damages due to deplorable conduct of the 1st

Appellant – As seen in the analysis of the evidence, the 1st Appellant who was a public

servant duty bound in his capacity as the Chief Invigilator to look-after the legitimate

74 | 79

interests of examination candidates, had, in violation of his official duties acted in a

grossly negligent, arbitrary, callous, highhanded and deplorable manner. His conduct

has been in contumelious disregard of the Respondent’s right to sit for the ‘General

English’ examination paper and her ensuing plight. Such deplorable conduct has resulted

in causing an inerasable scar in the academic track-record of the Respondent. That in my

view warrants the imposition of ‘exemplary damages’ on the 1st Appellant. The award of

exemplary damages which would be nominal in quantum, should serve as a punitive

measure against the 1st Appellant and as a deterrence to all public servants who may be

called upon to officiate at public examinations and generally to perform official and

public functions.

General damages due to psychological trauma suffered – In this regard, it would be

necessary to revert to the evidence of the Respondent. Her position is that when the 1st

Appellant told her that she cannot be permitted to sit for the ‘General English’

examination paper, she got anxious. She had left the examination centre and remained

outside for about half an hour, unable to decide on the course of action to be taken. Court

can take judicial notice of the psychological trauma she would have suffered as a result

of this situation. She had thereafter gone home, collected the ‘timetable’ and returned to

the examination centre. In the ensuing situation, she had also been denied the

opportunity of sitting for part II of the ‘General English’ examination paper. This has

caused her further trauma. In the statement made to the Veyangoda police station on 1st

September 2001 (“P2”) the Respondent has stated that due to the 1st Appellant

disallowing her from sitting for the ‘General English’ examination paper, she was

deprived of completing the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination in August 2001. She has also

explained that due to this incident, she became frustrated and it affected her mental

tranquility. Her position is that as a result of the ensuing psychological trauma, she could

not successfully prepare herself and answer the remaining examination paper.

75 | 79

As quite rightly pointed out by the learned District Judge, the negligent conduct of the 1st

Appellant has resulted in the Respondent not being able to complete the G.C.E. (A/L)

examination held in August 2001. She had to sit for the examination another time in order

to pass all subjects including ‘General English’. It is necessary to take judicial notice of

the nature and magnitude of the psychological trauma suffered by the Respondent when

she was deprived of her legitimate entitlement to sit for the ‘General English’ examination

paper. When she encountered the incident described in this judgment, particularly in

view of the critical importance of successfully passing the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination, the

Respondent would have suffered immensely due to the negligent conduct of the 1st

Appellant. It is of course apparent that the loss and psychological injury and harm

suffered by the Respondent is incapable of financial assessment. Nevertheless, the afore-

stated consequences arising out of the culpable negligence of the 1st Appellant justify in

my view the awarding of substantial general damages in the form of a solatium, as

opposed to nominal damages. If harm such as psychological trauma and suffering

resulting in incalculable loss due to unlawful conduct should go unredressed, that would

occasion a failure of justice and in the long-term, result in the public losing faith in the

system of administration of justice.

An additional circumstance which justifies the awarding of general damages - It is

necessary to point out that learned Counsel for the Respondent did submit that the

negligence on the part of the 1st Appellant had resulted in prospective as opposed to

accrued patrimonial loss to the Respondent. His submission was that such prospective

patrimonial loss is incapable of financial assessment and hence could not be proven

through evidence on monetary terms. Given the fact that the negligence necessarily

attributable to the 1st Appellant resulted in the Respondent not having been able to pass

the ‘General English’ examination paper of the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination held in August

2001 and that having a bearing on the Respondent’s employability, I am inclined to agree

with learned Counsel for the Respondent that the impugned negligent conduct of the 1st

Appellant caused loss, which for obvious reasons cannot be assessed and determined on

76 | 79

financial terms. As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Respondent, the

consequences arising out of the negligent conduct of the 1st Appellant are both accrued

and prospective. That the Respondent did not pass the ‘General English’ examination

paper of the GCE (A/L) Examination held in August 2001 would remain forever a

negative feature in her academic track-record. The consequential loss particularly arising

out of possible non-selection for certain employment opportunities is incapable of

financial assessment. Such loss incapable of financial assessment should not stand in the

way of the Court objectively determining and awarding general damages to the

Respondent on equitable terms.

In this regard it is necessary to bear in mind that there can be circumstances in which the

consequences of the infringement of a legal right cannot as in this case be assessed and

determined in terms of financial criteria. That such consequences are incalculable should

not in my view, stand in the way for a Court determining and awarding general damages

that are justifiably due to the party whose rights have been infringed. Therefore, in my

view, the quantum of damages to be awarded should necessarily be determined based

on the circumstances of the case. The applicable circumstances which describe the

consequential harm occasioned to the Respondent has been narrated above. Thus, in my

view, additional to the entitlement to receive ‘nominal damages’ in respect of the

infringement of her rights, the Respondent is entitled to ‘general damages’ due to the

factors of harm I have elaborated above, including but not limited to (i) psychological

harm suffered by the Respondent, (ii) prospective incalculable loss arising out of not

being able to sit for and obtain an assessment grade for ‘General English’ at the August

2001 G.C.E. (A/L) Examination and (iii) prospective incalculable loss associated with

non-selection for certain future employment opportunities.

It is lawful for a Court to award ‘general damages’ as the cumulative effect of different

heads of damages, which in this case, is the aggregate of afore-stated general damages,

nominal damages and exemplary damages.

77 | 79

Thus, in view of the foregoing, it is my view that, as determined by the learned District

Judge and affirmed by the learned Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court, the

imposition of Rs. 1,000,000/= (One Million Rupees) as general damages payable by the

Appellants to the Respondent is lawful and quite justifiable in the circumstances of this

case.

In view of the analysis of evidence contained in this judgment and the findings I have

reached, I answer the questions of law in respect of which leave to appeal had been

granted, in the following manner:

(a) It would amount to a violation of regulations pertaining to the conduct of

examinations, if an Invigilator were to allow a candidate to sit for the examination

without ensuring whether such candidate is entitled to sit for the relevant

examination paper. One way in which that could be ascertained would be by

examining the ‘attendance register’ (also referred to as the ‘attendance sheet’) for

the relevant day. Another would be by examining the ‘admission card’ and the

third method would be by examining the ‘timetable’ of the relevant candidate. The

‘attendance register’ and the ‘admission card’ of the Respondent were in the

official custody of the 1st Appellant. Without examining either of those documents,

the 1st Appellant had disallowed the Respondent to sit for the ‘General English’

examination paper.

(b) When there is a case before Court claiming damages, the trial Judge should first

ascertain whether the aggrieved party claiming damages has properly established

his case. In this case, the learned District Judge and the learned Judge of the High

Court of the Provinces have satisfied themselves that the Respondent (Plaintiff)

has properly established her case for damages.

78 | 79

(c) The party claiming damages (in this instance the Respondent) should prove his

case on a ‘balance of probabilities’, as is the general standard degree of proof in a

civil case. In this case, the Respondent has successfully discharged the burden of

proof cast on the Plaintiff and proven her case on a ‘balance of probabilities’.

(d) A Judge should decide each case before him objectively, in terms of the law, and

on its own merits. In this matter, the learned District Judge and the Judge of the

High Court of the Provinces have decided the case on such criteria.

(e) The general damages that have been awarded to the Respondent are in accordance

with the law and legal principles governing the award of damages in an Aquilian

action.

I have previously answered the vital question of law which arose during the course of

the argument, namely the question regarding the adaptability of the Roman-Dutch

common law and in particular the law relating to the Lex Aquilia to suit contemporary

requirements. That question of law has been answered in the affirmative.

In view of the foregoing, I see no justification to interfere with the impugned judgment

of the High Court of the Provinces. In the circumstances, this Appeal is dismissed. The

damages due to the Respondent shall be paid by the Appellants jointly. The Respondent

will be entitled to receive legal interests on the damages awarded by the District Court

from the date of the judgment of the District Court.

79 | 79

The assistance provided to Court by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

Appellants and the learned Counsel for the Respondent significantly contributed

towards this Court adjudicating this Appeal in the manner it has and accordingly their

support is gratefully acknowledged.
