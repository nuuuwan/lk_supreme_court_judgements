Nirmalan Wigneswaran, Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents Argued on: 26th July 2021 Decided on: 21st January 2022 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J. In this application, the Petitioner, who is an Officer of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service is alleging inter alia that the Respondents have violated the Petitioners fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution and the freedom to engage in a lawful occupation guaranteed by Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Soon after the filing of this application, but prior to it being supported, the Public Service Commission had taken a further decision with regard to the Petitioner which prompted the Petitioner to file SC (FR) Application No. 55/2017 in February 2017, complaining of the said decision as well and alleging inter alia that the Respondents have violated the Petitioners fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. On 6th November 2019, this Court granted the Petitioner leave to proceed in both applications in relation to the infringement of the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution. As the complaint of the Petitioner set out in this Application is subsumed in SC (FR) Application No. 55/2017, the said application was fixed for argument, with this application being mentioned together with the said application. When this matter was taken up for argument on 26th July 2021, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents informed this Court that the parties in this application would abide by the judgment that would be delivered by this Court in SC (FR) Application No. 55/2017. By its judgment delivered today, this Court, for reasons set out therein, has dismissed SC (FR) Application No. 55/2017, without costs. Accordingly, this application too shall stand dismissed, without costs.
