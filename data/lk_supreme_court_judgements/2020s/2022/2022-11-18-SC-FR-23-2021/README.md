Page 4 of 20

Janak De Silva, J. The Petitioner is impugning the transfer order dated 05.01.2021 (P27) by which she was

transferred to the Internal Administration Section of the Ministry of Public Services,

Provincial Councils and Local Government. Furthermore, she seeks a direction on the 1st

to 14th Respondents to appoint her as the Divisional Secretary of Dambulla or as the

Divisional Secretary of any other area within the Central Province. Court has granted leave

to proceed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner joined the public service on 02.10.2006 as a Grade III officer of the Sri Lanka

Administrative Service (SLAS) after successfully passing an open competitive examination.

She was promoted to SLAS Grade II effective 02.10.2016 and thereafter to SLAS Grade I

effective 03.10.2016. Whilst the Petitioner was serving as the Assistant Divisional

Secretary of Akurana, she was appointed to “attend to duties” in the post of Divisional

Secretary of Matale with effect from 01.01.2014. Thereafter, consequent to her being

promoted to Grade 1 of SLAS, the Public Service Commission (PSC) by letter dated

11.07.2017 (P7) appointed the Petitioner to the Post of Divisional Secretary of Matale,

with effect from 03.10.2016.

By January 1, 2020, the Petitioner had completed six years as Divisional Secretary of

Matale. According to the Transfer Scheme of SLAS contained in Public Administration

Circular No. 18/2019 dated 08.07.2019 (P11), the maximum period an officer can serve in

one Divisional Secretariat division is 6 years. Therefore, by transfer request dated

05.08.2019 (P12), the Petitioner requested an annual transfer for the year 2020, indicating

her preferences as Divisional Secretarial divisions of Dambulla, Ukuwela and

Page 5 of 20

Gangawatakorale. The Petitioner’s application for an annual transfer had been

recommended by the 1st Respondent, the District Secretary of Matale, to the Secretary to

the Ministry of Public Administration and Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs.

The PSC has delegated the power vested with it regarding Annual Transfers of Divisional

Secretaries to the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in charge of the subject of

Home Affairs (11R1). On 30 November 2019, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public

Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government had issued

Annual Transfer Orders of 2020 (P13). According to item No.051 of the said Transfer

Order, the then Divisional Secretary of Dambulla, namely, Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi

Hewapathirana, had been transferred to the Department of Immigration and Emigration

and the Petitioner had been transferred as the Divisional Secretary of Dambulla. However,

by notice dated 20.01.2020 (P14) published on the official website of the PSC, the above

Order of Transfer No. 051 had been differed for a period of one year by the Ministry of

Public Administration. Parties are not at variance of the factual matrix set out above.

Before examining the disputed factual matters between the parties, it is convenient to set

out the grounds on which the Petitioner is impugning P27. They are:

(i) There is no exigency of service in the Internal Administration Section of the

Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government (referred

to by the Petitioner as “purported pool”).

(ii) There is no provision in law, to maintain a ‘pool’ of public officers without

assigning any duties.

Page 6 of 20

(iii) The original transfer by the PSC to Dambulla Divisional Secretariat has not been

cancelled by the PSC. The PSC confirmed the Petitioner’s annual transfer to

Dambulla in terms of the Annual Transfer Scheme P11, as such the Petitioner

had a legitimate expectation to be transferred to the Divisional Secretariat

Dambulla.

(iv) The PSC has not granted the approval to transfer the Petitioner to the said

purported pool.

(v) Transfer is in violation of the PSC Rules.

(vi) The impugned purported transfer contained in P27 and P28, has been made in

violation of P11 (Annual Transfer Circular).

(vii) Transfer is tainted with malice (collusion between the 1st Respondent and

Petitioner’s allegedly estranged husband).

Legitimate Expectation

It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that her transfer by P27 has been made in

violation of the Annual Transfer Circular (P11) and in violation of her legitimate

expectation to be transferred to the post of Divisional Secretary, Dambulla as that transfer

had not been cancelled by the PSC.

It appears that Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi Hewapathirana had appealed to the PSC against the

decision to defer the Transfer Order No. 051 for a period of one year (11R3). After

reviewing her appeal, the PSC granted her, by order of February 17, 2020 [P15(b)], the

transfer to the Department of Immigration and Emigration.

Page 7 of 20

The Petitioner claims that she too appealed against the order of deferment of Transfer

Order No. 051 to the PSC. To support that position, the Petitioner submitted a letter dated

02.03.2020 [P15(a)]. However, I observe that this letter is dated 02.03.2020 whereas the

order of cancellation of the deferment of Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi Hewapathirana [P15(b)]

was issued on 17.02.2020, 14 days prior to the alleged appeal made by the Petitioner.

Moreover, it is clear that only the name of the said Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi Hewapathirana

is listed in the order dated 17.02.2020 [P15(b)]. Furthermore, the 11th Respondent

(Secretary of the PSC) categorically denies that the Petitioner appealed to the PSC against

the deferral of transfer order No. 051 prior to the order of cancellation of the deferment

of Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi Hewapathirana. According to the 11th Respondent, the Petitioner

appealed to the PSC regarding the 2020 annual transfers only by her letters dated

24.02.2020, 27.02.2020, 28.02.2020 and 02.03.2020 [P15(a)].

It is contended by the Petitioner that following order dated 17.02.2020 [P15(b)] of the

PSC, she had by letter dated 26.02.2020 (P16) requested the 1st Respondent to take steps

to release her from the Divisional Secretariat of Matale. However, she claims that

although Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi Hewapathirana had been released from the post of the

Divisional Secretary of Dambulla, no steps had been taken to release her from the post of

Divisional Secretary of Matale.

It appears that the 12th Respondent had by letter dated 10.03.2020 (12R4) informed the

Secretary, PSC that there is an inquiry pending in the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat

regarding the purchase of a land for the business purposes of the husband of the

Petitioner. As such, the 12th Respondent did not recommend that the Petitioner be

appointed as Divisional Secretary, Dambulla in view of the conflict of interest. It was

Page 8 of 20

recommended that the 15th Respondent be appointed to attend to the duties as Divisional

Secretary, Dambulla.

Subsequently, the 15th Respondent had been appointed to “attend to duties” in the post

of Divisional Secretary of Dambulla by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government with effect from

27.02.2020 P(19) based on the recommendation of the 1st Respondent. This letter has

been copied to the Secretary, PSC.

Moreover, it is clear that the PSC was aware that the Petitioner was not being sent to

Dambulla as Divisional Secretary. This becomes clearer upon an examination of letter

dated 10.07.2020 (12R5) sent by the Secretary, PSC to the 12th Respondent, copied to the

Petitioner, in reply to his letter dated 10.03.2020 (12R4). The PSC had requested the 12th

Respondent to expeditiously conduct the inquiry pending in the Dambulla Divisional

Secretariat regarding the purchase of a land for the business purposes of the husband of

the Petitioner and submit the results to the PSC. This matter is corroborated by the

contents of letter dated 20.08.2020 [Marked A10 and Annexed to 1R1] sent by the

Secretary, PSC wherein it is stated that further steps on the transfer of the Petitioner will

be considered upon the PSC receiving the report on the investigations being conducted

within the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat.

Accordingly, I conclude that the PSC only approved the transfer of Ms. Abhaya Lakshmi

Hewapathirana to the Department of Immigration and Emigration. There is no order from

the PSC directing that the Petitioner be transferred as the Divisional Secretary, Dambulla.

Page 9 of 20

At this stage, it is relevant to examine the conclusions of the investigations into the

Dambulla land transaction which have been submitted to the Court. Prima facie, the

findings provide cogent evidence of an act of misconduct on the part of the Petitioner in

relation to a state land situated at Dambulla over which her husband has a business

interest.

Evidence of this transpired after an article had been published in the Lankadeepa News

Paper on or about 07.06.2018, titled “මාතලේ ප්‍රා: ලේකම්වරියලේ සැමියා රත්මේකට්ටුව

වැලේ ල ෝටේ දනවා” (12R1). As a result, a preliminary investigation into the content of

the newspaper article was opened on 13.08.2018 by the Ministry of the Home Affairs and

concluded on 09.11.2020. During the investigation, it became apparent that the

Petitioner's husband had built 4 cottages on state land in Lake Rathmalkattuwa in

Dambulla.

Documentation regarding the following transactions was provided by the Respondents to

support this disclosure. The original owner of the land in question was a Hettiaarachchige

Lucas Appuhamy who had obtained the land through ‘Jaya Bhoomi’ Land Grant No.

මධ්‍යම/දඹු/1097. Then said Hettiaarachchige Lucas Appuhamy had transferred the land to

a Mudiyansela Gedara Dhammika Piyawathie Manike by deed No. 8646 dated 04.01.2009

and attested by Jayampathi Ratnadiwakara Notary Public.

Subsequently, the Petitioner's husband, Angoda Welegedara Siril Jayaweera, obtained a

special power of attorney in relation to the land through a well-executed process. Based

on the evidence before the Court, the Petitioner was actively involved in this process. It

began with the Petitioner transferring property belonging to her situated in the Divisional

Page 10 of 20

Secretariat Division of Yakkamulla, in the District of Galle to the said Mudiyansela Gedara

Dhammika Piyawathie Manike by deed of transfer No. 71 dated 14.12.2016 attested by

K.G.A. Ranasinghe Notary Public (Annexure A1 of 1R1). Thereafter, the said Mudiyansela

Gedara Dhammika Piyawathie Manike had transferred the land on which the chalets were

constructed to Kalahe Paadikoralage Jayaratne, the brother of the Petitioner, by deed of

transfer No. 812 dated 10.07.2017 attested by G.M.U.G. Indika Seneviratne Notary Public

(Annexure A1 of 1R1). The said Kalahe Paadikoralage Jayaratne by special power of

attorney No. 815 dated 13.07.2017 attested by G.M.U.G. Indika Seneviratne Notary

Public, had transferred all rights and powers over the said land to Angoda Welegedara

Siril Jayaweera, the allegedly estranged husband of the Petitioner (Annexure A4 of 1R1).

Within a few days thereafter, the Petitioner was able to regain the property she had

transferred to Mudiyansela Gedara Dhammika Piyawathie Manike by deed of transfer No.

71 dated 14.12.2016 attested by K.G.A. Ranasinghe Notary Public, through deed of

transfer No. 91 dated 25.07.2017 attested by the same Notary Public (Annexure A3 of

1R1).

The 1st Respondent in his affidavit avers that according to the legal provisions governing

transfer of state lands, the approval of the Divisional Secretary needs to be obtained in

order to transfer the land to a third party. To obtain this approval, the transferor must

have ownership of another land. The 1st Respondent avers that the Petitioner had

shrewdly manipulated the legal provisions by transferring her property to the said

Mudiyansela Gedara Dhammika Piyawathie Manike prior to the execution of the said

Deed of Transfer No. 812 in order to obtain the approval of the Divisional Secretary of

Dambulla for the transfer.

Page 11 of 20

In response to these allegations, the Petitioner states that the transaction in question was

in good faith and had been approved by the Divisional Secretary of Dambulla. Other than

this bare assertion, the Petitioner has not explained the circumstances under which she

transferred her property to Mudiyansela Gedara Dhammika Piyawathie Manike, the

reason for the said Piyawathie Menike thereafter to transfer the state land to the brother

of the Petitioner and the reasons for her brother thereafter to give a Power of Attorney

over the said land to her husband and finally why soon thereafter the said Piyawathie

Manike re-transferred the land given by the Petitioner to her.

Instead of responding to these serious allegations, the Petitioner has produced along with

the counter objections tape recordings allegedly containing conversations between her

husband and the 1st Respondent. A transcription of the alleged conversations was also

provided.

However, the Court is not prepared to proceed with this evidence on several grounds.

According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent acted maliciously against her while she

and her husband were separated and the husband was colluding with the 1st Respondent.

The question then is how she could get so-called recordings of telephone conversations

between them.

In any event, the question of proper custody is important in the circumstances of the case.

In my opinion, the Court should observe the fundamental rules of evidence in exercising

its jurisdiction over fundamental rights. Furthermore, this tape recording was not

produced with the petition providing an opportunity for the 1st Respondent to respond.

Counter-objections should not be used to present evidence that was available with the

Page 12 of 20

Petitioner and, had it been produced with the petition, would have given the Respondents

an opportunity to respond. This is an application of the Audi alteram partem rule on which

the procedural rules of this Court are firmly built.

Upon an examination of the factual matters pertaining to the transaction relating to the

State land at Dambulla, I am of the view that the circumstances fully justify the action

taken to prevent the Petitioner from assuming duties as Divisional Secretary, Dambulla.

To allow that to happen would have created an obvious conflict of interest. In this context,

it is interesting to observe that the Petitioner had, in specifying three stations for her

annual transfer (P12), named Dambulla and Ukuwela which are situated outside the

Kandy District, as her first and second choices although admittedly her two children, aged

12 and 13, are schooling in Kandy.

Accordingly, I reject the contention that the transfer of the Petitioner by P27 is in violation

of the Annual Transfer Circular (P11) and in violation of her legitimate expectation to be

transferred to the post of Divisional Secretary, Dambulla on the basis that it had been

approved by the PSC.

Malice

In the alternative, the Petitioner contended that the impugned transfer is marred by

malice and animosity, as the 1st Respondent and the Petitioner's allegedly estranged

spouse acted in collusion. It was submitted that the 1st Respondent developed an

animosity due to the Petitioner taking steps to open the access road to Buddhist College,

Maligatenna, Matale which was closed by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner has cited a

few instances reflecting the subsequent malicious acts of the 1st Respondent such as

Page 13 of 20

verbal abuse and threats at meetings held at the Divisional Secretariat and at Buddhist

College, Maligatenna, Matale. Another instance is where the 1st Respondent directed the

Petitioner to submit medical records of her aunt in order to approve a personal leave that

she had obtained on 21.09.2020 (P26). The failure of the 1st Respondent to release the

Petitioner from Matale to assume duties in Dambulla is also cited as another example.

However, as fully explained earlier, the Respondents have placed cogent prima facie

evidence before Court of an act of misconduct on the part of the Petitioner in relation to

the state land in Dambulla. Hence the failure to allow the Petitioner to assume duties as

Divisional Secretary of Dambulla is justified on grounds independent of malice and the

failure to allow the Petitioner to assume duties in such post is not a malicious act on the

part of the 1st Respondent.

That leaves the question of malice to be examined in relation to the transfer of the

Petitioner to the Internal Administration Section of the Ministry of Public Services,

Provincial Councils and Local Government.

According to the Respondents, this transfer was intended to facilitate an investigation into

further alleged misconduct by the Petitioner while she was Divisional Secretary of Matale.

These acts are outlined in letter dated 11.10.2020 (1R1). No doubt the Petitioner has

sought to provide explanations to some of these allegations unlike her bare denial of the

allegation relating the land transaction in Dambulla. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court

to render a definitive decision on the veracity of these allegations. It is a matter for the

proposed investigation. For the purposes of the determination of this application, it

suffices to state that some of these allegations are forging the signature of the husband

Page 14 of 20

in a letter sent to the PSC, providing false information to senior public officers, failure to

give effect to lawful orders of the immediate supervising officer which are serious in

nature.

In all the foregoing circumstances, I am unable to hold that the 1st Respondent acted

maliciously in recommending an immediate transfer of the Petitioner out of the district

on a temporary basis until the conclusion of the relevant investigations. The decision

taken to transfer her on exigencies of service to the Internal Administration Section of the

Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government is justified as more

fully discussed below.

Exigency of Service

The transfer of the Petitioner by P27 has been done on exigency of services. It is

contended that there cannot be any exigency of service inasmuch the Petitioner has been

transferred to the Internal Administrative Section of the Ministry of Public Services,

Provincial Councils and Local Government or the “pool” as referred to by her where she

is without any work.

Procedural Rule 218-III of the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules reads:

218. A Public Officer may be transferred on exigencies of service by the

Appointing Authority for any one of the following reasons:

(iii) Where it is found, due to administrative reasons, that the retention

of an officer in his present station is not suitable.

Page 15 of 20

The request to transfer the Petitioner was made to facilitate an investigation into alleged

misconduct. The conduct of such an investigation is part of the administrative functions

of the Public Service. Therefore, in my opinion, the transfer of the Petitioner by P27 is in

accordance with the Public Service Commission Rules.

In any event, I observe that in recommending the transfer of the Petitioner, the Secretary

to the Ministry of Internal Security, Home Affairs and Disaster Management (12th

Respondent) had recommended that it be done in terms of Procedural Rule 222-III of the

Public Service Commission Procedural Rules which reads:

222. The Appointing Authority may transfer a Public Officer on disciplinary

grounds, in the following instances, even without prior notice. The

Appointing Authority shall convey the reasons in writing to the officer

concerned:

(iii) Where it is found on matters revealed either before the beginning, or

in the course of an investigation or on existing circumstances that the

retention of a Public Officer in his post or station may obstruct the

conduct of a preliminary investigation.

Hence, in any event, the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules provided for the

transfer of the Petitioner in the circumstances of this matter.

It is an established principle that as long as an authority has the power to do a thing, it

does not matter if he purports to do it by reference to a wrong provision of law, and the

order can always be justified by reference to the correct provision of law empowering the

authority making the order to make such order. [See L. C. H. Peiris v. The Commissioner

Page 16 of 20

of Inland Revenue (65 N.L.R. 457), Kumaranatunga v. Samarasinghe and Others (1983)

2 Sri.L.R. 63, Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam and Others (1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 100, Seneviratne and

Others v. Urban Council, Kegalle and Others [(2001) 3 Sri.L.R. 105]

Accordingly, I hold that the transfer of the Petitioner is not in violation of the procedural

rules on the ground urged by the Petitioner.

PSC Approval

The Petitioner contends that the PSC has not granted approval to transfer the Petitioner

to what is referred to by the Petitioner as the ‘pool’.

The 1st Respondent had, by letter dated 11.10.2020 (1R1), informed the 12th Respondent

of several acts of alleged misconduct of the Petitioner, and recommended that action be

taken to investigate those matters. It was also recommended that the Petitioner be

temporarily transferred out of the district on exigencies of service to prevent any

impediment to the investigations. In response, the 12th Respondent, by letter dated

29.10.2020 (12R6), informed the Additional Secretary (Home Affairs) that a charge sheet

involving charges coming under the First Schedule of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments

Code is to be served on the Petitioner in relation to item 1 in letter dated 11.10.2020

(1R1). Further it was stated that the other charges set out in letter dated 11.10.2020 (1R1)

are of a very serious nature and that the Petitioner should be immediately transferred to

the pool of the Ministry of Public Administration subject to covering approval of the PSC

as retaining her in the present post will be an impediment to the investigation. The

request was made in terms of Procedural Rule 222(iii).

Page 17 of 20

Accordingly, the Additional Secretary (Home Affairs) by letter dated 03.11.2020 (12R7)

requested the Secretary, Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local

Government to immediately transfer the said transfer subject to covering approval of the

PSC. This request was also made in terms of Procedural Rule 222(iii). It is only thereafter

that the Secretary, Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government

had sent the impugned letter dated 05.01.2021 (P27) transferring the Petitioner to the

Internal Administration Section of the Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and

Local Government. The transfer had been made subject to the covering approval of the

PSC and the letter had been copied to the 11th Respondent, Secretary of the PSC. It is

stated that the transfer is being made on exigencies of service although the request was

made under Procedural Rule 222(iii).

No material has been placed before Court on whether the PSC gave its approval or not for

the impugned transfer. The affidavit filed by the 11th Respondent does not shed any light

on this matter, other than that the PSC received the request for approval. It may well be

that the PSC did not have sufficient time to review the request given that the Petitioner

invoked the jurisdiction of Court on 03.02.2021.

Nevertheless, Court is not inclined to hold that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution has been violated due to

the transfer being made subject to the covering approval of the PSC as there is evidence

that the covering approval was in fact sought and that the PSC had failed to take a decision

on the request until the jurisdiction of this Court was invoked.

Page 18 of 20

In any event, it is trite law that a person invoking the fundamental rights jurisdiction of

this Court must act with uberima fides and make a full disclosure of all material facts [See

Liyanage & Another v Ratnasiri - Divisional Secretary, Gampaha & Others (2013) 1

Sri.L.R. 6, Jayasinghe v The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering

(NIFNE) and others (2002) 1 Sri L.R. 277]. The application is liable to be dismissed where

a party fails to do so. In paragraph 22 of her petition, the Petitioner denies that her

husband has a business in Dambulla, which is incorrect. This a material fact to her

application to be posted as Divisional Secretary of Dambulla. Hence, this application is

liable to be dismissed in limine.

Furthermore, the Court is exercising its just and equitable jurisdiction under Article 126(4)

of the Constitution. It is an established maxim that he who comes into equity must come

with clean hands. This doctrine has nothing to do with the general conduct of a party. The

misconduct which is condemned should form part of the transaction which is the subject

of the dispute. Where the conduct of a party to the litigation is unmeritorious in relation

to the transaction forming the subject matter of the litigation, a Court exercising equitable

jurisdiction is entitled to refuse any relief to such party [See Gascoigne v. Gasscoigne

(1918) 1 K.B. 223, Tinker v. Tinker (1970) 1 All ER 540]. In this application, the Petitioner

has sought a direction that she be appointed as Divisional Secretary of Dambulla. Her

unmeritorious conduct in relation to the land in Dambulla suffices for Court to refuse any

relief. Hence, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled any relief.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss this application.

Page 19 of 20

Before parting with this judgment, I am compelled to observe that the conduct of the

Petitioner in relation to the land transaction in Dambulla is an imminently suitable matter

to be considered by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.

The just and equitable jurisdiction this Court exercises in terms of Article 126(4) of the

Constitution to make suitable directions is not contingent on making an affirmative finding

that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner are infringed [See Noble Resources

International Pte Limited v. Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Power and

Renewable Energy and Others, S.C. (F/R) Application No. 394/2015, S.C.M. 24.06.2016].

The jurisdiction extends to making all necessary orders to uphold the rule of law. Bribery

or corruption in the public sector is a cancer destroying public confidence in the system

of governance. It must be eliminated by enforcing the rule of law in which this Court has

an imperative role to play. Court cannot turn a blind eye where prima facie material

involving an act of corruption relating to the land transaction in Dambulla has been placed

before it. Therefore, I direct the Registrar of the Supreme Court to send a certified copy

of this judgment along with a complete set of the pleadings in this application to the

Director-General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption by

name expeditiously. In fact, a complaint has already been lodged with the Commission by

the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs and Provincial Councils &

Local Government on 26.06.2020 (12R1).

Page 20 of 20

For the avoidance of doubt, the findings made on the transaction relating to land in

Dambulla has been made on the material placed before Court by all parties. Any future

inquiry or investigation into this matter must consider all evidence that the parties may

adduce.

Application dismissed.
