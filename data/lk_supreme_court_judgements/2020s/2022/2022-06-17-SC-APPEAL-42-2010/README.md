L.T.B. Dehideniya, J.

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometime referred to as the Appellant) instituted an

action in the District Court of Tangalle by plaint dated 05.02.1996, seeking for a declaration of

title and ejectment of the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter sometime referred to as

the Respondent) from the land called Kahagalagodella/Bogahahena, morefully described in the

schedule to the Plaint. The Appellants argument is that the Respondent was in unlawful and

forcible occupation in the said land.

The Appellant submits that Peter Silva who was the original owner of the land in question died

intestate leaving as his heirs his wife Vineetha Ediriweera Jayasuriya (Appellants Aunt) and the

daughter A.P Baby Champa Matilda (Respondents Wife), who gifted the said land to the

Appellant by deed No.645 dated 28.09.1973 attested by H.S De Silva Notary Public (marked as

P-1). Thereafter, Vineetha Jayasuriya and Baby Champa Matilda revoked the said gift by deed of

revocation No.710 dated 18.09.1976 attested by Charles Wirittamulla Notary Public (marked as

P-2), with the consent of the Appellant. However, upon receiving information from the Bank that

the aforesaid deed of gift No.645 is an irrevocable gift and therefore the said revocation is not

valid, the Appellant gifted the entire property to Vinitha Jayasuriya by the deed No.970 dated

19.05.1977 (marked as P-3). The Appellant further submits that thereafter, the property had been

divided into three blocks and transferred the lot No. 2 and 3A to the Appellant by deed No.08 dated

12.08.1977 and deed No.3774 (marked as P-4 and P-5) and gifted lot 3 by the deed No.3775

(marked as P-6) to Baby Champa Matilda, who later transferred the said rights by the deed

No.4598 dated 27.10.1984 (marked as P-7) to the Appellant. Accordingly, the Appellant argues

that he is the absolute owner of the property in question.

The Respondent, who was the husband of Baby Champa Matilda submits that Baby Champa

Matilda did not transfer her rights to the Appellant by deed No.4598. The Respondents position

is that the said deed is a fraudulent document.The Respondent further denied the rights of the

Appellant and claimed that since the deed of gift No.645 was cancelled by the deed of revocation

No.710, the Appellant is not entitled to transfer his rights to Vinitha Jayasuriya by the deed No.970.

Having considered the aforementioned evidence, the Learned District Judge entered the judgement

in favour of the Appellant holding that an irrevocable deed of gift cannot be revoked by a deed of

revocation and the deed of gift executed by the Appellant (marked as P-3) is a valid gift and

thereafter the Appellant got title from deeds P-4 to P-7. Being aggrieved by the said judgement,

the Respondent tendered an appeal there from to the Civil Appellate High Court of Southern

Province holden at Matara. Civil Appellate High Court held that as Vinitha Jayasuriya and Baby

Champa Matilda had revoked the deed of gift No.645 with the consent of the Appellant by the

deed of revocation No.710 (marked as P-2), the deed of gift No.970 does not transfer any

rights/title.Therefore, the High Court set aside the judgement of the District Court and held that

the deeds produced marked P-3 to P-7 are null and void and further held that Baby Champa

Matilda has never transferred her rights to the Appellant by the deed No.4598 (marked as P-7). It

is from the aforesaid judgement that this appeal is preferred.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law;

1) Have their Ladyships Judges misconstrued the law relating to revocation of deed of gifts?

2) Have their Ladyships Judges disregarded the fact that said deed of gift No.645 had been

made with the consent of all the parties concerned?

5

3) Is their Ladyships Judges judgment contrary to the Principles relating to ownership of an

immovable property?

4) Have their Ladyships Judges failed to consider that the Respondent was estopped in law

from disputing the title of the Appellant?

5) Have their Ladyships Judges misdirected or misguided when they held that ownership of

the Respondent was established in proceedings initialed under section 66 of the Primary

Court Procedure Act?

6) Have their Ladyships Judges failed to appreciate the fact that in his judgement the learned

trial Judge has come the most appropriate conclusion after evaluation of evidence and

considering applicable legal principles?

The Appellants case is based upon the ground that the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

have come to the erroneous conclusion that deed No.970 (marked as P-3) and all the subsequent

deeds after the deed of revocation No. 710 (marked as P-2) do not have any legal validity and

therefore no title has been transferred to the Appellant. When considering the legal context of the

issue before this court and the evidence tendered by both parties, it appears that by the deed of

revocation No. 710 dated 18.09.1976 attested by Charles Wirittamulla Notary Public, the donor

(Vineetha Jayasuriya and Baby Champa Matilda) has revoked the deed of gift No. 645 and the

Appellant has consented to the same.

In the eyes of the law it is competent for the donor to reserve to himself the right to revocation of

a deed of gift.

A similar view was expressed in the case of Stephen v. Hettiarachchi and Another [2002] 3 Sri

L.R 39 at p.43 per Weerasuriya J.

6

Although ordinarily a deed of gift is irrevocable by the donor nevertheless it is

competent for the donor to reserve to himself the right of revocation in which

event the donor can by executing a subsequent deed of revocation..

The legal question of whether a donor can revoke a deed of gift with the express consent of the

donee. This can be decided upon examining the expressed intention of the parties. In the case of

Jinaratana Thero v. Somananda Thero (1946) 32 C.L.W. 11 it was held that in construing a deed,

the expressed intention of the parties must be discovered.

In Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Jayathilaka v. R.M. Siriwardena of Ihalagama (S.C. Appeal No.

221/2012, decided on 19.12.2019) at p.8 per E. A. G. R. Amarasekara J,

The afore quoted legal texts, decisions and authorities indicate that when

interpreting a deed, a court has to;

Find the expressed intention of the parties,

Find such intention through the meaning of the words used in the deed while

considering the whole document to ascertain the true meaning of its several

clauses. Sometimes the very form of the document may help in ascertaining the

intention

When considering the present application, by the deed of revocation No.710, the both Appellant

and the donor has expressed their valid consent to revoke the deed of gift No.645.

Deed of revocation No.710 marked as P-2, at p. 1-2;

.

Under the law, a deed of gift is irrevocable unless donor reserves the right to revoke the gift. This

legal concept gives a right to the donee that he can retain the title without any disturbance from

the donor. If the donee, the person who receives the gift, is willing to return the gift to the donor,

the person who gave the gift, donor, need not to reserve the right to revoke. The donee can give

consent to revoke the gift. In the present case also, the deed is an irrevocable deed, but the donee

consented for the revocation. Therefore, the deed of revocation No.710 (marked as P-2) becomes

a valid deed and the deed of gift No.645 (marked as P-1) was revoked.

With the deed of revocation the title to the land in question repassed to the original owners, namely;

Vineetha Jayasuriya and Baby Champa Matilda. After the deed No. 710 (marked as P-2) has been

executed, no title remains on donee. Therefore, the deed of gift No. 970 (marked P-3), which was

executed after the deed of revocation marked as P-2, will not transfer any right/title to the donee

of the deed of gift No. 970 (marked P-3), Vineetha Jayasuriya.

. . 645

However, as per the aforesaid discussion, since the deed of revocation No.710 is valid, the

Appellant (donor) has no title at the time of execution of deed No.970. Therefore, the Appellant

8

did not have a legal right to execute the said deed No.970 and consequently the said deed does not

convey any rights before the law.

It is a well-established legal principle under the Roman Dutch common law exceptio rei venditae

et traditae provides that where a vendor/transferor sells without title but subsequently acquires

one, this title adds to the benefit of the purchaser and those claiming through him. In the case of

Nicholas De Silva v. Shaik Ali (1895) 1 NLR 228 at. p 238 Withers J. explained that, if A sells

for value and delivers to me a land which does not at the time belong to him; if he acquires it

afterwards and brings an action to re-vindicate it, I may defeat him by saying, But you sold and

delivered it to me. I may plead sale and delivery with equal effect against the true proprietor

who, inheriting the land from my vendor, seeks to re-vindicate it, and this plea is available to those

to whom I sell for value and their assigns.

Nevertheless, the law identifies several instances where exceptio rei venditae et traditae is not

applicable; which includes cases of gifts.

In the case of Tissera v. William (1944) 45 NLR 358, Keuneman J. held with observing the Voet's

Commentaries: Book XXXIX-Title 5;

...Counsel for the appellant argued that under this issue the Commissioner has

utilized the exceptio rei venditae et traditae, and that this exception is not

applicable to the case of a donation. Certainly no authority has been cited to me to

show that this exception applies in the case of a donation, nor am I satisfied that a

donation of this kind can be regarded as a sale.

Voet (XXXIX 5, 10) dealing with donations states as follows: - .in case of doubt

"the presumption should not be in favour of a donation, secondly because a

9

donation is stricti juris and on that account should receive a stricter construction

so as to burden the donor as little as possible.. [emphasis added]

Therefore, as the deed No.970 is a deed of gift, it is apparent to this Court that the principle of

exceptio rei venditae et traditae cannot be applied in the present application.

The Appellant submits that even if the title of the land in question was repassed to its original

owners Vineetha Jayasuriya and Baby Champa Matilda by the deed of revocation No.710, said

Vineetha Jayasuriya and Baby Champa Matilda had a legal right to transfer their undivided shares

to the Appellant by four deeds of transfer respectively deed No.08 (marked as P-4), deed No.3774

(marked as P-5), deed No.3775 (marked as P-6) and deed No.4598 (marked as P-7). The

Appellants contention is that whether the deed of gift No.970 is valid or invalid it makes no

difference with regard to the devolution of title and the Appellant has become the absolute owner

of the property.

When carefully examining the aforesaid transfer deeds (marked as P-4, P-5 and P-6) it appears

that what was transferred by the transferee is the title that she received upon the said deed of gift

No.970.

Deed of transfer No.3775 marked as P-6, at p.1

..

Therefore, since the deed of revocation No.710 is valid and the deed of gift No.970 does not

transfer any rights/title, consequently aforementioned three deeds of transfer marked as P-4, P-5

and P-6 does not convey any rights before the law.

The Appellant, further submits that title rights of Baby Matildas undivided share was transferred

to the Appellant by the deed of transfer No.4598 dated 27.10.1984 (marked as P-7). According to

the recitals of the said deed, it was stated that Baby Matilda was transferring the rights she received

from transfer deed No.3775 which does not convey any rights as for the reasons discussed above.

Deed of transfer No.4598 marked as P-7, p.1

Therefore it is clear to this Court that the deed of transfer No.4598 also does not convey any rights

before the law.

The Appellant submits that the Learned High Court Judges have misguided when they held that

the ownership of the Respondent was established in proceedings initiated under Section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act. The Respondent argues that nowhere in judgement, the Learned

High Court Judges have stated that the Respondent has established his ownership to the property

in question in the Primary Court Proceedings.

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act which deals with inquiries into disputes affecting

land, where a breach of the peace is threatened or is likely. In the case of Rajamanthri Gedera

Somalatha v. Wajira Kanthi Rathnasinghe (SC Appeal 33/2013, SC minutes dated 07.11.2019)

Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda PC. cited with approval of the well-known decision of Ramalingam

v. Thangarajah (1982) 2 Sri L.R 693 where it was held that a matter under section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act is not a civil action and the object is to prevent a breach of peace,

not to decide any question of title or right to possession of the parties to the land. Accordingly,

based on the Order made by the Magistrates Court under the section 66 application, it cannot be

justified ones possession or title rights to a land. Therefore, it is apparent that Section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act cannot be applied to the present application.

By considering above circumstances, I answer the questions of law as follows,

1) No

2) No

3) No

4) No

5) No

6) No
