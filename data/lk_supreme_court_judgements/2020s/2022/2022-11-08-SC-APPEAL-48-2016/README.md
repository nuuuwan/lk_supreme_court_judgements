Decided on: 08.11.2022

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J.

The Plaintiff- Respondent- Petitioner (hereinafter called as the Petitioner) instituted action in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya claiming a right of way on prescription and necessity against the

1st and 2nd Defendant- Petitioner- Respondent (hereinafter called as the 1st and 2nd Respondent)

and two others. Plaintiff’s claim was that lot No.5 of the plan bearing No. 507 dated 10th

October 1982 surveyed by G.S. Galagedara Licensed surveyor was belonged to him and he used

the right of way to access to his land over the lot 7 of the said plan. 1st and 2nd Respondents

obstructed said right of way by erecting a gate and by other means. After trial, the Learned

District Judge delivered the Judgement in Appellant’s favour granting all the reliefs prayed for

by the Appellant. The Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of North Western

Province where the appeal was dismissed and leave to appeal there from to the Supreme Court

was also dismissed.

On the application of the Appellant a writ was issued to remove all the obstructions and the

fiscal has executed writ on 21.07.2010 and reported to court that it has been properly executed.

Thereafter the Respondent made an application of District Court informing that the writ had not

4

been executed properly by not removing the electricity posts and telephone posts which were on

the right of way and moved court that the writ be reissued. The District Court ordered that only

the obstructions that the Petitioner claims to be an obstruction to his right of way can be

removed. The 1st and 2nd Respondents appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court challenging

the said order. The learned judges of High Court ordered to reissue the writ on the application of

Respondent who is the judgement debtor. Being aggrieved by the said order the Appellant

tendered this appeal to this court. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law;

1) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala and/or

Learned Additional District Judge of Kuliyapitiya have erred in law by making an order to

execute the writ once again despite the fact that the decree of the case bearing No. 12483/L

of the District Court of Kuliyapitiya has already been executed as far back on 21 July 2010?

2) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala have erred

in law by disregarding the fact that non other than a judgement creditor can make an

application to execute the writ?

3) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala have erred

in law by arriving at a conclusion that the judgement debtor is entitle to make an application

to execute the writ when in fact the decree has already being executed at the request of the

judgement creditor?

4) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala have erred

in law by making an order to remove the Telephone Posts and trees ect. purportedly on the

basis that they are obstructions to the said right of way?

5) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala have erred

in law by coming to an erroneous conclusion that the purported obstructions as claimed by

the judgment debtor should also be removed?

5

6) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala have erred

in law due to their failure to consider that due to the purported directions and/or orders

made in the said impugned judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Judgement

and/or decree is invariably altered and or changed?

The main issue of this case is whether the judgement debtor can make an application to reissue a

writ after the writ had been properly executed on the application of the judgement creditor. On

the other hand if the judgment creditor is satisfied with the execution of the decree can the

judgment debtor move to reissue the writ on the basis that it was not properly executed?

In this case, the Learned District Judge delivered the judgement as prayed for in the plaint. As

per the answer given to the issue No. 19 in the judgment dated 12/07/2007, the Learned District

Judge dismissed the claims of the 1st and 2nd Respondents prayed for in the answer. Under these

circumstances the Appellant became the judgement creditor who was granted all the reliefs

claimed and Respondents became judgement debtors whose claims were dismissed.

Under Section 323 of Civil Procedure Code any “...application to the court for execution of

the decree may be made by the judgment-creditor in the manner, and according to the rules...”

The Civil Procedure Code has made it a policy that only the judgement creditor can make and

application to execute a decree. The reason behind is that the judgement creditor is the person

who was granted relief not the judgement debtor.

In the case of W. Sirinivasa Thero v. Sudassi Thero (1960) 63 NLR 31 it was held that by

invoking inherent jurisdiction on certain occasions, a judgement debtor or the party who lost the

case may be able to ask for a writ of execution, if the original execution was done without a

right to get a writ of execution or the execution of the writ has given more than the entitlement

of the judgement creditor causing injury to the judgement debtor through an erroneous act or by

a mistake of court.

However, case at hand does not fall within the ambit of an error or mistake of the court.

6

As per Section 4(e) of Civil Procedure code the plaint shall contain a demand of the relief which

the Plaintiff claim. If the Defendant claims anything in reconvention under Section 75(e), he has

to claim it in the answer and that will have the effect as plaint in a cross action.

The court cannot grant any relief not prayed for by the plaint or the claim in reconvention. It has

been held on the case Surangi Vs Rodrigo 2003 Sri L.R 35 that no court is entitle to or has

jurisdiction to grant relief to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the plaint. Further

in Danapala Vs Baby Nona 77 NLR 95 it was held that even a Magistrate cannot award any

sum in excess of quantum claimed by the applicant in a maintenance action. In the case of

Weragama Vs Bandara 77 NLR 289 it has been held that the Learned District Judge erred in

granting the first plaintiff relief not prayed for and not claimed in the action by him.

It appears, the Respondents had some claims in reconventions which were refused to be granted

(vide answers to issue number 19). The 1st Defendant has referred to these Telephone Posts in

her answer dated 19.09.2000 (document marked as X-1 in the brief- averments 13-15 of the

answer). No issue has been raised by the 1st and 2nd Defendants over that (vide issues in the

judgment of the District Court).It appears that the Respondents are now trying to get what they

were not given or refused to be given through the judgement.

If the court cannot grant any relief, which is not prayed for in the action, I am of the view that,

the Respondent who loss his case cannot claim to reissue the writ on the basis that it was not

properly executed.

The relief granted to the Appellant in the District Court is a right of way. Plaintiff is satisfied

with the way of execution of the writ. No relief granted to the Respondent. He may or may not

use this right of way. But there is no pronouncement by the court that the Respondents are

entitle to use the questionable road. Therefore court has no jurisdiction to issue writ of execution

on the application of the Respondents.

7

The Respondent argument is that they are also using the right of way depicted as lot 7 of the said

plan to gain access to their land depicted as lot 6 of their plan. The Learned District Judge in his

judgement noted that this right of way is used for lot 5 and lot 6 in the page 34 of the judgement.

But the Learned District Judge has not made any determination or granted any relief in favour of

the Respondents. Therefore 1st and 2nd Respondents will not get a right to execute the writ.

Another argument of the 1st and 2nd Respondents was that the writ had not been properly

executed. This case was filed by the Appellant, the judgement was in favour of the Appellant

and the writ was issued in favour of the Appellant. In these circumstances if the Appellant was

satisfied that the decree was executed properly, any other person including the Respondent has

no right to say that writ was not properly executed. The judgment is of a declaration of a right of

way. The party who claimed the said right of way is satisfied that the writ was executed properly

and now he can use the path, the judgment debtor has no right to say that there are some more

obstructions which need to be removed. In the instant case the Respondents are trying to remove

the telephone and electricity lines that are leading to the Appellant’s house on the pretext of the

judgment where the Appellants were given the right to use the road. Court cannot allow that

type of mischievous applications.

Respondents in their Written Submission argued that the judgement of the District Court is per

incuriam. After the judgement was affirmed by Civil Appellate High Court and leave to appeal

to the Supreme Court being refused, the Respondent cannot argue that the judgement of District

Court is per incuriam. If so, the Respondents should have preferred such application when leave

to appeal was refused by this Court in 2009.

I answer the questions of law as follows;

1) Yes

2) Yes

3) Yes
