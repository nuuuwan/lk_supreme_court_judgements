P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (Ran Malu Fashions (Private) Limited)

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Ran Malu Fashions”), filed the petition dated 25th

October 2011 in the Commercial High Court of Western Province, under part XII of the

Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Companies Act”),

praying that the said company Ran Malu Fashions be wound up by Court. The learned

Commercial High Court Judge on the application made by Ran Malu Fashions (as per the

motions dated 25th October 2011 and 27th October 2011),1 had appointed Mr. P. E. A.

Jayewickreme and Mr. G. J. David of SJMS Associates (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the “Liquidators”), as provisional liquidators of Ran Malu Fashions. The said

appointment of the provisional liquidators has been produced marked X 3.

Upon the said petition being advertised, a number of creditors of Ran Malu Fashions

indicated their intention to appear at the hearing of the winding up Application. The

Creditor-Appellant, Expolanka Freight (Private) Limited, (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as “Expolanka”) is one of the Companies that had given notice of its intention to be

heard at the hearing of the winding up application.

Having dealt with various applications made by various parties including Expolanka, the

learned Commercial High Court Judge by the order dated 18th January 2013 (produced

marked X4), ordered that Ran Malu Fashions be wound up and confirmed the

appointment of the provisional liquidators.

In carrying out the winding up process, the Liquidators filed several reports before the

Commercial High Court informing Court about the progress of the winding up. Liquidators

published notices calling on the creditors of Ran Malu Fashions to submit their claims

upon which Expolanka submitted its claim for Rs. 1,774,333.06. Expolanka claims that

1 Vide page 1238 and 1240 of Vol I of the brief.

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 5 of 22

the Liquidators have accepted its claim as it has not received any notice of rejection of

its claim either under section 357(4) of the Companies Act or under Rule 69 and 71 of

the Companies winding up Rules 1939. Expolanka also claims that the Liquidators have

categorized its claim as a claim by an unsecured creditor of Ran Malu Fashions.

In the course of the winding up process, the Liquidators had filed several reports. They,

in their report produced marked X 5 dated 05th June 2014,2 informed Court, the mode of

settlement of Secured Claims, Preferential Claims and Unsecured Claims.

In the aforesaid report (X 5), the Liquidators informed Court inter alia, that certain claims

made by the Commissioner of Labour were paid in full, as they are preferential claims.

However, the Liquidators in the same report, sought permission of Court to categorize

the claim for Rs. 428,119,086.50 made by the Commissioner General of Labour on

account of compensation for termination of services under the Terminations of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as TEWA), under “Unsecured Claims”. The Liquidators in the same report, also

had sought permission of Court to pay only 63.7% of the claim for Rs. 428,119,086.50

forwarded by the Commissioner General of Labour relating to the recovery of

compensation payable under TEWA by Ran Malu Fashions, to its employees for the

termination of their employments.

Thereafter, the Commissioner of Labour made an application to court by way of a petition

dated 10th September 2014 marked X 63 seeking to admit its claim of Rs. 428,119,086.50

under the TEWA, as a Preferential claim under section 365 of the Companies Act.

The other creditors including Expolanka filed objections against the said application made

by the Commissioner General of Labour. The said objection dated 12th January 2015, has

been produced marked X 7. 4

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 6 of 22

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court, having considered the arguments,

pronounced its order dated 25th July 2016, rejecting the objections raised by Expolanka

and the other creditors, and admitted the claim of the Commissioner General of Labour

for the sum of Rs. 428,119,086.50 as a Preferential Claim under section 365 of the

Companies Act. The said order of the Commercial High Court, has been produced marked

X 10.5

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court in his order, has concluded that the

claim made by the Commissioner General of Labour for Rs. 428,110,096.50, is a statutory

due payable to the employees. He has then proceeded to hold that the claim made by

the Commissioner General of Labour, is in fact, a Preferential Claim within the meaning

of section 365 read with paragraph (g) of the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Act No.

07 of 2007 ((hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Ninth Schedule”). Further, the

learned High Court Judge has also stated that the claim made by the Commissioner

General of Labour is not a Unsecured Claim. It is on that basis that the learned

Commercial High Court Judge has stated that the Liquidators have no power to reduce

the quantum of compensation decided and claimed by the Commissioner General of

Labour and directed the Liquidators to comply with the above conclusion and submit a

report to court in respect of the distribution of funds.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, Expolanka preferred the Leave to Appeal

Application (SC/HCCA/LA No. 48/2016) pertaining to the instant appeal (SC Appeal No.

210/2016) challenging the order dated 25th July 2016 of the Commercial High Court. The

Liquidators too preferred the Leave to Appeal Application (SC/HCCA/LA No. 47/2016)

pertaining to the appeal (SC Appeal No. 209/2016) challenging the same order (dated

25th July 2016) of the Commercial High Court.

This Court, when the said Leave to Appeal Application were supported before it, having

heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for relevant parties, by its order dated 28th

5 Vide page 821 of Vol I of the brief.

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 7 of 22

October 2016, has granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the following question of law

which reads as follows.

“Whether the claim made by the Commissioner General of Labour under and in

terms of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.

45 of 1971 as amended, can be considered as a preferential claim in terms of Section

365 and the 9 th Schedule of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007”.

The learned Counsel appearing in each of these appeals, agreed that the said appeals

can be heard together. They also agreed that it would suffice for this Court to pronounce

one judgment in respect of all these appeals as it is only a single pure question of law

that has to be decided by this Court. i.e., the question of law, this Court has granted

Leave to Appeal, in both of those appeals.

As the above question of law involves interpretation of the relevant provisions of law

referred to therein, it would be convenient to commence the relevant discourse with the

reproduction of those provisions. They are as follows:

Section 365 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

365. (1) The liquidator shall pay out of the assets of the company the expenses,

fees, and claims set out in the Ninth Schedule to the extent and in the

order of priority specified in that Schedule and that Schedule shall apply

to the payment of those expenses, fees, and claims according to its tenor.

(2) Without limiting paragraph 7(b) of the Ninth Schedule, the terms “assets”

in subsection (1) shall not include assets subject to a charge, unless—

(a) the charge is surrendered or taken to be surrendered

or redeemed under section 358; or

(b) the charge was when created, a floating charge in

respect of those assets.

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 8 of 22

Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Act No 07 of 2007.

PREFERENTIAL CLAIMS

1. The liquidator shall first pay, in the order of priority in which they are listed: —

(a) the fees and expenses properly incurred by the liquidator in carrying out

the duties and exercising the powers of the liquidator and the remuneration

of the liquidator;

(b) the reasonable costs of a person who applied to the court for an order that

the company be put into liquidation, including the reasonable costs of a

person appearing on the application whose costs are allowed by the court;

(c) the actual out-of-pocket expenses necessarily incurred by a liquidation

committee.

2. After paying the claims referred to in paragraph 1, the liquidator shall next pay

the following claims :—

(a) all provident fund dues, employees trust fund dues and gratuity payments

due to any employee;

(b) income tax charged or chargeable for one complete year prior to the

commencement of the liquidation, that year to be selected by the

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue in accordance with the

provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006;

(c) turnover tax charged or chargeable for one complete year prior to the

commencement of the liquidation;

(d) value added tax charged or chargeable for four taxable periods prior to the

commencement of the liquidation, such taxable periods to be selected by

the Commissioner- General of Inland Revenue in accordance with the

provisions of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002;

(e) all rates or taxes (other than income tax) due from the company at the

commencement of the liquidation which became due and payable within

the period of twelve months prior to that date;

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 9 of 22

(f) all dues to the Government as recurring payments for any services given

or rendered periodically;

(g) industrial court awards and other statutory dues payable to any employee;

(h) subject to paragraph 4, all wages or salary of any employee whether or

not earned wholly or in part by way of commission, and whether payable

for time or for piece work, in respect of services rendered to the company

during the four months preceding the commencement of the liquidation;

(i) holiday pay becoming payable to an employee (or where the employee has

died, to any other person in the employee’s right), on the termination of

the employment before or by reason of the commencement of the

liquidation;

(j) unless the company has at the commencement of the liquidation, rights

capable of being transferred to and vested in an employee under a contract

of the kind referred to in section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation

Ordinance, all amounts due in respect of any compensation or liability for

compensation under that Ordinance, which have accrued before the

commencement of the liquidation;

(k) subject to paragraph 4, amounts deducted by the company from the wages

or salary of an employee in order to satisfy obligations of the employee.

Let me at this stage list out briefly, the main arguments advanced by the rival parties to

this case.

The following main arguments have been advanced on behalf of the Liquidators and

Expolanka:

1) The Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 does not list compensation to be paid under

TEWA, as a preferential payment and if the legislature intended such claim to be

included as a Preferential Claim, the legislature would have added it expressly in

the same way it had added provident fund dues, employees trust fund dues and

gratuity payments appearing in item No. 2(a) of the Ninth Schedule.

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 10 of 22

2) When interpreting “other statutory dues” referred to in item No. 2(g) of the Ninth

Schedule, Court must adopt the Ejusdem Generis principle; as the said item No.

2(g) reads as “industrial court awards and other statutory dues payable to any

employee”, the phrase ’statutory dues payable to any employee’ must be confined

to the same class or kind as “industrial court awards” ; the said item No. 2(g)

“industrial court awards and other statutory dues payable to any employee” must

therefore be interpreted necessarily as “other statutory dues as set out in the

Industrial Disputes Act”.

3) The Ninth schedule refers only to situations where a state/party/employee has

already earned the money sought to be recovered from the company being wound

up, and not a future unearned unascertained or probable debt.

The following main arguments have been advanced on behalf of the Commissioner

General of Labour:

1) The Commissioner of Labour exercises a statutory power when making an order

under the provisions of section 6A of TEWA; a claim made as per such an order is

therefore a statutory claim.

2) The words “other statutory dues” found in item No. 2(g) in the Ninth Schedule,

should be interpreted literally and given its ordinary meaning as it is a general

phrase.

3) A phrase conjoined by the word “and” must be read separately; the word “and”

found in item No. 2 (g) in the Ninth Schedule clearly indicates that Industrial Court

Awards and other statutory dues are two or more separate sets of remedies

available to an employee under two or more separate statutes; item No. 2(g)

cannot therefore be confined only to the Industrial Disputes Act; the Appellants

have intentionally ignored the words “and other” when interpreting item No. 2(g).

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 11 of 22

Having observed the inter-connection of the above arguments, I would not think that

they should be dealt with separately in isolation to one another. Thus, to start with, it

would be prudent to consider the nature of the claim put forward by the Commissioner

General of Labour. The said claim has been made on account of compensation payable

for termination of services under section 6A of TEWA which is as follows:

6A. (1) Where the scheduled employment of any workman is terminated in

contravention of the provisions of this Act in consequence of the closure

by his employer of any trade, industry or business, the Commissioner may

order such employer to pay to such workman on or before specified date

any sum of money as compensation as an alternative to the reinstatement

of such workman and any gratuity or any other benefit payable to such

workman by such employer.

The word “Statutory” is defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary 11th Edition, as follows;

1. Of, relating to, or involving legislation <statutory interpretation>

2. Legislatively created <the law of patents is purely statutory>

3. Conformable to a statute <a statutory act>

Therefore, the word “Statutory” denotes something which emanates consequent to a

provision in a legislative enactment. The phrase “statutory dues” must therefore mean

the dues which emanate from the provisions of such legislative enactments.

Section 6A of TEWA which I have reproduced above, clearly shows that it is the statute

namely TEWA, which has conferred the power on the Commissioner to order an employer

to pay to a workman a sum of money as compensation as an alternative to reinstatement.

One could observe numerous provisions scattered throughout TEWA which confer

statutory powers on the Commissioner. For example: section 13 of TEWA, empowers the

Commissioner to make directions calling for material from an employer; sections 17 and

17A of TEWA empower the Commissioner, to hold inquiries for the purpose of

implementing the substantive provisions of the Act. It is noteworthy that section 17 of

TEWA requires the Commissioner to conduct the aforesaid inquiries complying with the

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 12 of 22

principles of natural justice. The fact that the Commissioner is required by law to comply

with the principles of natural justice when conducting such inquiries, is a clear and

unambiguous indication that the Commissioner in such instances decides the rights of the

parties to such inquiry. No state functionary can decide the rights of parties without any

statutory power being conferred upon such functionary. Therefore, this too is a clear

indication that in all those instances the Commissioner exercises nothing but statutory

powers. Those are all powers conferred on the Commissioner by TEWA.

Thus, when the Commissioner orders an employer to pay to a workman, a sum of money

as compensation, there cannot be any doubt that the Commissioner exercises a statutory

power vested in him under section 6A of the said Act.

Moreover, the Commissioner calculates the quantum of such sums of money payable as

compensation as per the formula set out in the Gazette Extraordinary of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka No. 1384/07 dated 15th March 2005. This is a Gazette

issued by the Commissioner of Labour exercising a statutory power namely section 6D of

TEWA. The Commissioner General of Labour has produced the said Gazette marked A in

the Commercial High Court. This further confirms the proposition that it is a statutory

power which the Commissioner exercises when he orders an employer to pay to a

workman a sum of money as compensation for termination of services under section 6A

of TEWA.

The item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule “industrial court awards and other statutory dues

payable to any employee” contains two items. The first of those is “industrial court

awards”. The second is “other statutory dues payable to any employee”. These two

phrases are conjoined by the word “and”. Therefore, they are two distinct items.

Remedies available to an employee under Industrial Court Awards is different from a

remedy available to an employee under other statutes which are commonly known as

‘statutory dues’. The word “other” denotes statutes other than that under which an

Industrial Court Award is made. If the argument of the Appellants is to be accepted, then

that would amount to altering the phrase, “other statutory dues” to read as “such other

statutory dues”. Thus, if the argument of the Appellants is to be accepted, then they have

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 13 of 22

added the additional word “such” for their own benefit. However, it is the Appellants

themselves who advocate the proposition that Court cannot read new words into existing

provisions of law.

Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes -12th Edition at page 33 states:

"It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that nothing is to be added

to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate grounds to justify the inference

that the legislature intended something which it omitted to express. Lord Mersey

said: "It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not

there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do." "We are not

entitled" said Lord Loreburn L.C., “to read words into an Act of Parliament unless

clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself". A case not

provided for in a statute is not to be dealt with merely because there seems no good

reason why it should have been omitted, and the omission appears in a consequence

to have been unintentional" [emphasis added]

The maxim Ejusdem Generis is applicable in situations where the relevant statutory

provision contains an enumeration of specific words. Bindra, 10th Edition page 758 states

that the presence of following requirements are necessary for the application of that rule

when interpreting a provision of law.

i. The statute contains an enumeration by specific words;

ii. The members of the enumeration constitute a class or category;

iii. The class is not exhausted by the enumeration;

iv. A general term follows the enumeration;

v. there is a distinct genus which comprises more than one species;

vi. there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a

broader meaning than the doctrine requires

One does not find in item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule any such enumeration or listing

of things which can satisfy the requirement in (i) above. Since there is no enumeration

or listing of things, rest of the above requirements have no application to item No. 2(g)

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 14 of 22

of the Ninth Schedule. Therefore, in my view, Court cannot apply the maxim Ejusdem

Generis in the instant situation.

The phrase “statutory dues” is a phrase commonly used in Labour Law. That simply

means entitlements a workman would get under statutory provisions. This does not refer

to one piece of legislation. One would find entitlements of workmen under numerous

statutes.

Thus, on the consideration of the above arguments, I am unable to accept the submission

of the Appellants that the “other statutory dues payable to any employee” must be limited

to dues only under the Industrial Disputes Act.

Another argument advanced by the Appellants is that if the legislature intended to include

all and sundry (including TEWA), under the phrase “other statutory dues’” it need not

have specifically listed only certain statutes to the exclusion of the others. It is their

argument that the legislature would have merely stated that all statutory dues (for

employees) shall be treated as preferential payments and not specifically list only certain

statutes in the Ninth Schedule. It is their submission that the legislature has specifically

identified and included only certain statutes because it had wanted only those statutes to

be given preference in a process of winding up. They submit that Court cannot add

another statute into item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule.

The Appellants at no stage challenged the liability of the company under liquidation to

pay the amount of the claim put forward by the Commissioner General of Labour. Their

only argument is that it should not be considered as a preferential payment in terms of

item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule.

During the argument, the Counsel for the liquidators highlighted the development of the

Companies Act by comparing the old Companies Act (Act No. 17 of 1982) with the present

Act (Act No. 07 of 2007) and submitted that in both Acts, the Legislature has not included

and/or expressly excluded any compensation payable under TEWA. It would be relevant

at this stage to glance through section 347(1) of the Companies Act No 17 of 1982 which

states as follows:

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 15 of 22

347. (1) In a winding up there shall be paid in priority to all other debts-

(a) income tax charged or chargeable for one complete year prior to the

relevant date, such year to be selected by the Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 28 of 1979;

(b) business turnover tax charged or chargeable for one complete year prior

to the relevant date, such year to be selected by the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue in accordance with the provisions of the

Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963;

(c) all rates, or taxes (other than income tax) due from the company at the

relevant date, and having become due and payable within the twelve

months immediately prior to that date;

(d) all dues to the Government of Sri Lanka as recurring payments for any

services given or rendered periodically;

(e) all provident fund dues, gratuity payments, and industrial court awards

payable to any employee or workman;

(f) all wages or salary (whether or not earned wholly or in part by way of

commission) of any clerk or servant in respect of services rendered to

the company during the four months immediately prior to the relevant

date and. all wages (whether payable for time of work or for piece work)

of any workman or labourer in respect of services so rendered;

(g) all accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any clerk, servant,

workman or labourer (or in the case of his death to any other person in

his right) on the termination of his employment before or by the effect

of the winding up order or resolutions;

(h) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the

purposes of reconstruction or of amalgamation with another company,

or unless the company has at the commencement of the winding up,

under such a contract with insurers as is referred to in section 24 of the

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 16 of 22

Workmen's Compensation Ordinance rights capable of being transferred

to and vested in the workman, all amounts due in respect of any

compensation or liability for compensation under such Ordinance, being

amounts which have accrued before the relevant date.

The Appellants rely on the fact that the “employees trust fund dues” which was not

included in the order of priority under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 has been

specifically included in the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. It is their submission that if

the legislature intended to include compensation payable under TEWA also in the order

of priority in the Ninth Schedule of the Companies Act of 2007, it could have done it in

the same way it added “employees trust fund dues” at the time it passed the new

Companies Act in 2007.

Section 347 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 was the then prevailed corresponding

provision to the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Thus, it can be

seen that although section 347 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 had a place for the

“Industrial court awards” in its long list, it had not recognized statutory dues (in that

form) payable to an employee at any level in the said list. In contradistinction to the

above, the present Act (Act No. 07 of 2007) has specifically listed ‘statutory dues’ in its

Ninth Schedule. This development shows that the legislature has deliberately brought in

“statutory dues payable to any employee” to the list in the Ninth Schedule to the

Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Item No. 2(g) is the level of priority, the legislature has

thought fit it should confer on the category “statutory dues payable to any employee” in

the Ninth Schedule. Had the Parliament intended to restrict “other statutory dues” only

to dues arising out of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Parliament could have stated so to

that effect by adding few more words to that item. However, that was not the case.

As has been adverted to above, according to section 365(1) of Companies Act No. 7 of

2007, it is mandatory for the liquidator to pay out of the assets of the company, the items

set out in the Ninth Schedule in the order of priority specified in that Schedule. Thus, the

items set out in the Ninth Schedule do not merely form a list of things but predominantly

an order of priority. This is re-iterated at the very commencement of the Ninth Schedule

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 17 of 22

to the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 by the phrase “The liquidator shall first pay, in the

order of priority in which they are listed”. It is in that backdrop that the legislature has

deliberately prioritized “all provident fund dues, employees trust fund dues and gratuity

payments due to any employee” by placing it as the first item in paragraph (2) of the

Ninth Schedule. The legislature has not deliberately accepted that it should recognize the

category “statutory dues payable to any employee’” as an item requires a similar status

of priority when paying out of the assets of the company. The paragraph 2(g) is the

level/status of priority, the legislature had deliberately conferred on “statutory dues

payable to any employee”’ in the Ninth Schedule. The legislature had wanted to give the

exact same priority level/status to “industrial court awards” as well. In my view, that is

the reason why the legislature in its wisdom has worded item No. 2(g) of the Ninth

Schedule as “industrial court awards and other statutory dues payable to any employee”.

Therefore, in my view, it is not correct to argue that if the legislature intended to

recognize the compensation payable under TEWA as a preferential payment, it should

have added it specifically in the same way as employees’ provident fund dues, trust fund

dues and gratuity payments appearing in 2(a) of the Ninth Schedule. On the other hand,

if the legislature had specifically recognized compensation payable under TEWA it would

then deliberately give a different level of priority than the priority afforded commonly to

all statutory dues. I am of the view that this is the mischief the legislature had wanted to

avoid as there is no rational basis to recognize only the compensation payable under

TEWA over the various other forms of statutory dues. Therefore, what the legislature had

intended to prioritize at the level of paragraph 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule is not merely

the compensation payable under TEWA but the category called ‘statutory dues payable

to any employee’. The argument of the Appellants that allowing TEWA to be read into

item No. 2(g) in the Ninth Schedule would open the door for all other statutory dues,

cannot succeed as the said term ‘statutory dues’ has been qualified by the phrase

“payable to any employee” which automatically restricts the application of the provision.

For those reasons, I am unable to accept the argument of the Counsel for the Liquidators

that if the legislature had wanted to give priority to the compensation payable under

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 18 of 22

TEWA, it should have specifically added it in no uncertain terms as it had done to the

provident fund dues, employees trust fund dues and gratuity payments. Thus, when it is

not possible to prevent ‘the compensation payable under TEWA’ falling under the category

“statutory dues payable to any employee”, it is not possible to prevent ‘the compensation

payable under TEWA’ falling under item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule to the Companies

Act No. 07 of 2007.

Another argument put forward by the Liquidators and Expolanka is that the Ninth

Schedule refers only to situations where a state/party/employee has already earned the

money sought to be recovered from the company wound up and not future unearned

unascertained or probable liabilities. In other words, their position is that the company

wound up, should have already owed such money to state/party/employee as at the date

of commencement of the winding up action. They argue that the compensation payable

on account of termination of employment would be prospective damages and hence it

was not the intention of the legislature to prioritize them over the creditors of the

company who had actually lent money to the company. It is on that basis that they argue

that item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule should not be interpreted to include any claim

under TEWA.

They made the above submission on the basis that the “holiday pay becoming payable

to an employee on the termination of the employment before or by reason of the

commencement of the liquidation’” has been given a priority level [i.e., 2(i)] which is

lower than that given to the item No. 2(g) in the Ninth Schedule. Thus, it is their

submission that if prospective damages are given priority and paid (such as claims under

TEWA), then the employees would lose what they had already earned. Therefore, it is

their submission that such an interpretation would be prejudicial to the employees who

have already worked and earned such money.

I am unable to subscribe to this view. It is not the way to look at the Ninth schedule. It

has been the intention of the Parliament to regulate the termination of the services of

workmen in certain employments by their employers. This was done by TEWA. In the

following passage quoted from the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Serendib

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 19 of 22

Coconut Products Ltd. (In Voluntary Liquidation) and others v Commisioner General of

Labour and others6 Justice Sripavan highlighted the importance of the above protection

in following terms;

"The Termination of Employment of Workmen, (Special Provisions) Act is a special

legislation which makes special provision in respect of the termination of the services

of workmen in certain employments by their employers. By closure the workmen

are suddenly thrown out of employment for no fault of theirs and have to face

hardships; that is why the legislature gives a discretion to the Commissioner to make

an order for compensation."

In light of the above, it is clear that such employees by the mere fact of working in such

employments have earned the protection they have been afforded by the law of the

country. In my view, it is unreasonable for the creditors to claim their payments over the

payments due to the workmen for the loss of their livelihood. Their livelihood is something

protected by law. Creditors engage in a form of business when they lend money. They

take a risk when such lending is not secured. Workers are merely engaged in their

employment and work for the company. These employments are secured by TEWA if they

fall under that Act. Thus, I am of the view that the legislature has rightly intended to

recognize such claims as a preferential claim as per item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule.

It is not necessary for the legislature to specifically state ‘claims under TEWA’ because

such claims are any way recognized as statutory dues.

Although I observe that there are other several subsidiary arguments considered by the

learned Commercial High Court Judge I do not think it necessary for me to re-visit each

of those arguments again. This is because most of those arguments are arguments arising

out of, or connected with the main arguments I have already dealt with, in this judgment.

Suffice it to state here that I do not find that the learned Commercial High Court Judge

had erred at any point pertaining to the conclusions relating to those arguments.

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 20 of 22

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the order made by the Commissioner of Labour for

compensation under section 6A of the Termination of Employment (Special Provisions)

Act, is a statutory due within the meaning of item No. 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule to the

Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Therefore, the claim made by the Commissioner General

of Labour for Rs. 428,110,096.50 is a preferential claim in terms of section 365 read with

paragraph 2(g) of the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Act No 7 of 2007. It is not an

unsecured claim as categorized by the Liquidators.

There is yet another Appeal namely, SC Appeal No. 208/2016, the argument of which

was also taken up along with the arguments of SC Appeal No. 210/2016 and SC Appeal

No. 209/2016. In SC Appeal No. 208/2016 too, this Court, by its order dated 28th October

2016, has granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the same question of law. While SC

Appeal No. 208/2016 is a different case between different parties except for the

Liquidators, the Liquidators in all three appeals are the same. While the question of law

in respect of which, this Court has granted Leave to Appeal remains the same, the learned

Judge of the Commercial High Court in his order in SC Appeal No. 208/2016 has held that

the payments payable under TEWA, cannot be treated as a Preferential Claim specified

in item 2(g) to the Ninth schedule to the Companies Act. Thus, the decision of the

Commercial High Court pronounced in SC Appeal No. 208/2016 is quite the opposite of

what was decided by the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court in SC Appeal No.

210/2016 and SC Appeal No. 209/2016.It was the same set of counsel who represented

the parties of that case (i.e. SC Appeal No. 208/2016) also in this court during the

argument and they relied on the same arguments which I have already dealt with.

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court in his order in SC Appeal No. 208/2016

has held that the legislature did not intend to recognize the compensation payable under

TEWA as a preferential payment, as it had not added it specifically in the same way as

provident fund dues, employees trust fund dues and gratuity payments appearing in 2(a)

of the Ninth Schedule. I have already dealt with this argument.

Further, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court in SC Appeal No. 208/2016 has

also held that the phrase “other statutory dues payable to any employee’” should not be

(SC Appeal 210/2016 [with SC Appeal 209/2016 & SC Appeal 208/2016]) - Page 21 of 22

broadly interpreted as to encompass any other statutory dues payable to an employee.

However, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court is silent in that order as to

what other meaning which should be given to the phrase “other statutory dues payable

to any employee”, if it cannot be interpreted according to its usual meaning. Does it mean

that the said phrase is redundant? I do not think so. As I have already stated above, it

has been inserted as yet another item in the Ninth Schedule. That must be understood

in its general sense. In my view, the maxim Generalia Verba Sunt Generalita Intelligenda

which means ‘words are to be understood generally’ is applicable to the phrase in section

2(g) “other statutory dues”. It is a general term which need to be understood generally

as it is not qualified by a subsequent word. For those reasons, I hold that the learned

Judge of the Commercial High Court in SC Appeal No. 208/2016 has erred in coming to

the conclusion that the compensation payable under TEWA, cannot be treated as a

Preferential Claim specified in item 2(g) in the Ninth schedule to the Companies Act No.

07 of 2007.

Learned Counsel appearing in each of the above three appeals agreed that all the three

appeals should be heard together and that it would suffice for this Court to pronounce

one judgment in respect of all three appeals. This is because it is only a single pure

question of law that has to be decided by this Court in all these three appeals. That is the

question of law, this Court has granted Leave to Appeal, in all three appeals. I answer

the aforementioned question of law in respect of which this Court has granted Leave to

Appeal, as follows:

The claim made by the Commissioner General of Labour under the Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 as amended,

must be considered as falling under ‘other statutory dues payable to any employee’

(a preferential claim) in terms of section 365 and the item No. 2(g) in the Ninth

Schedule to the Companies Act No 07 of 2007.

This judgment must apply to SC Appeal No. 210/2016, SC Appeal No. 209/2016 and SC

Appeal No. 208/2016 as well.
