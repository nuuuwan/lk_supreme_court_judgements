Decided on: 25.11.2022

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J.

The Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this court alleging the infringement of Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under the Article 12(1) and the Article 14(A) of the Constitution by the

Respondents.

The Petitioner is a Medical Doctor and Consultant Psychiatric by Profession. The Petitioner has

filed the instant application on the ground that a grave irregularity has been committed in relation

to the tender contract No. GSWWMIIP/AFD/AMB/CIVIL/ICB/04 (document marked as P-3)

awarded by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (hereinafter sometime referred to as

the 1st Respondent) to the 5th and 6th Respondent companies. The said tender was proposed to

implement the project of ‘AFD Contractual Co- Financing- Ambatale Water Supply System

Improvement and Energy Saving Project – Supply and Laying of 9km of DI Pipes (1200mm)

from Ambatale to Colombo City Limit’.

Petitioner states that as a mandatory requirement, a party who awarded a tender contract must

comply with all the technical standard specifications in order to precede the project. Petitioner

submits that according to the specifications for DI pipes and fittings (document marked as A),

4

the Restrained Self Anchoring Joints which are to be used in the project must comply with

ISO10804:2010 standards or equivalent. The Petitioner’s position is that the Respondent

companies which were awarded the tender do not comply with the necessary standards of the

equipment. The Petitioners contention is that the 1st - 4th Respondents have acted illegally

attempting to change the standards, conditions and requirements set out at the time of calling for

tenders, after awarding the said tender.

It was further submitted by the Petitioner that as a result of the high pressure of the water

contained within the pipes, and the weight of the pipes themselves, the joints on the pipe line

must be of very superior manufacture and quality to prevent the joints from breaking and

leaking. Moreover, the Petitioner states that since the Ambathale water pumping station is

situated adjacent to the Kelani river, such waterlogged soil will necessarily provide very poor

support for the heavy iron pipes and therefore the Restrained Self Anchoring Joints which are to

be used to connect the pipes used in the said project will have to be of superior quality.

The Petitioner argues that the decision to award the contract to the 5th and 6th Respondents have a

severe effect of endangering the safety of the public and unlikely to cause immense hardship to

the water consumers who utilize the water supplied by the 1st Respondent for their daily needs

and cause a great financial loss to state and citizens of Sri Lanka. The Petitioner states that he has

a right to prosecute this application on his own behalf and behalf of citizens of Sri Lanka in the

Public Interest.

When this matter was taken up for support, the Respondents raised several preliminary

objections with regard to the maintainability of this application, in particular, the jurisdiction of

the Supreme Court to entertain and hear the Petitioner’s Application. The principal objection was

that the Application of the Petitioner has been filed outside the mandatory period of one month

5

stipulated in Article 126(2) of the Constitution and on that basis, the Respondents moved to have

this application dismissed in limine.

Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads as follows:

“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself for by an attorney-at-law on his behalf,

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of court as may be in

force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such

Court praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement..” (emphasis

added)

To consider whether the Petitioner has complied with Article 126 (2), in relation to the alleged

conduct of the Respondents that the Petitioner is challenging, this Court has to carefully examine

the dates which have been submitted by the Respondents.

The Respondents submit that the invitation to bid for the Tender in question was called for by the

Chairman of the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and it was publicly

advertised on or about 30.06.2014 (document marked as X-2). The 5th and 6 Respondents

submitted their bid on 09. 09. 2014. Through a letter dated 06.10.2014 the 1st Respondent had

sought clarification from several potential bidders, including the 5th and 6 Respondents, with

regard to the type test approval done in accordance with the ISO 10801:2010 standard in respect

of restrained pipes and fittings (document marked as X-4). It was submitted that once

clarifications were provided, the 1st Respondent referred it to the Technical Evaluation

Committee for evaluation and the 5th and 6th Respondents’ bid was accepted on or about 15. 12.

6

2014. The Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee approved the awarding of tender

to the 5th and 6th Respondents on or around 23. 06. 2015. Thereafter one of the unsuccessful

bidders appealed to the Procurement Appeal Board. In appeal, the Procurement Appeal Board

gave its decision and approved the Tender award to the 5th and 6th Respondents on 10. 08. 2015

(vide document marked X-16). After forwarding the decision of the Procurement Appeal Board

and the recommendation of the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee to the Cabinet of

Ministers, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the awarding of the tender to the 5th and 6th

Respondents on 05.11.2015. The said Decision of the Cabinet was published in newspapers and

made to the public on 07.11.2015 (vide the Cabinet Memorandum and the announcement marked

X-17).

It is noteworthy that the accuracy of the aforementioned dates have not been contested by the

Petitioner. Therefore, it seems at first glance that the alleged infringement of the Fundamental

Rights stated by the Petitioner has continued for more than a year, with the very last stage of

approval taking place on 05.11.2015 and the same being communicated to the public on

07.11.2015. The Petitioner in his submissions has provided an explanation for the objection of

the time bar. The Petitioner submits that at the beginning, all that the Petitioner had was a

suspicion that the 1st Respondent was acting illegally in sanctioning the use of sub-standard

equipment by the 5th and 6th Respondents and therefore; the Petitioner did not invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court at the time.

According to the Petitioner’s submissions, after having a suspicion on the actions of 1st

Respondents, the Petitioner made a request to the 1st Respondent under the Right to Information

Act No.12 of 2016 regarding the information pertaining to the tender in question on or around

21.03.2017 (vide the letter of request marked as P-8 and the postal article receipt marked as P-

7

8(a)). The Petitioner further submits that, the said request for information gave the 1st

Respondent a time period of two weeks to respond to the queries of the Petitioner, which was up

to 04.04.2017 and since the Petitioner did not receive any response, the Petitioner filed the

present application on 11.04.2017. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that he invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court within one month of posting the said request for information from the

1st Respondent.

When considering all the circumstances discussed above, it appears that it has taken nearly two

years to the Petitioner to make a request for information from the 1st Respondent, from the final

Decision of the Cabinet was published in newspapers and made to the public on 07.11.2015. If

the Petitioner had a strong desire to inquire about violation of fundamental rights, the said

request for information under the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016 could have been made

within a reasonable time after the final decision of granting the tender was made public. Almost

two years from the final decision had been made to public cannot be considered as a reasonable

time.

Judicial view of the objection of time bar in a Fundamental Rights application has been

discussed in a range of case law.

In the case of Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam (1985) 1 Sri LR 100 at p.105-106 it was held that this

Court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of one month set out in Article

126(2) of the Constitution is mandatory. Further, in the case of Ilangaratne vs. kandy Municipal

Council [1995 BALJ Vol.VI Part 1 p.10] his Lordship Justice Kulatunga observed that, the result

of the express stipulation of a one month time limit in Article 126(2) is that, this Court has no

jurisdiction to entertain an application which is filed out of time – i.e. after the expiry of one

month from the occurrence of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement which is

8

complained of and if it is clear that an application is out of time, the Court has no jurisdiction to

entertain such application.

A similar view has expressed in the case of Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v.

Dharmasena Dissanayake (SC/FR 206/2008, SC Minutes dated 09.12.2016)

Per Justice Prasanna Jayawardena PC at p.8

“Article 126(2) of the Constitution stipulates that, a person who alleges that any

of his fundamental rights have been infringed or are about to be infringed by

executive or administrative action may … “within one month thereof” … apply to

this Court by way of a Petition praying for relief or redress in respect of such

infringement. The consequence of this stipulation in Article 126(2) is that, a

Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one month from the time the

alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred and unmaintainable. This rule

is so well known that it hardly needs to be stated here.

The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filed within

one month of the occurrence of the alleged infringement will make that

application unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from the time

this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred upon it by the

1978 Constitution.” (emphasis added)

However, the court has in exceptional circumstances exercised its discretion to consider

applications for fundamental rights when the Petitioner was prevented from taking actions that

would have allowed the filing of a petition within one month of the alleged violation and if there

had been no lapse on the part of the Petitioner. This principle was laid down in the case of

9

Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena (1988) 1 Sri L.R 384, where Justice Mark Fernando held that,

while the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases, on an application of the principle lex non

cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay on the part of the Petitioner, this Court

has a discretion to entertain an application made out of time.

It is important for this Court to decide whether there are any exceptional circumstances to look

into in the present application. When considering the required standard to prove exceptional

circumstances, in the case of K.H.G Kithsiri v. Hon. Faizer Musthapha MP, Minister of

Provincial Councils and Local Government and Others (SC/FR Application No.362/2017, SC

minutes dated 10.01.2018) it was held that;

At p. 8

“If the facts and circumstances of an application make it clear that a

Petitioner, by the standards of a reasonable man, should have become aware

of the alleged infringement by a particular date, the time limit of one month

will commence from that date on which he should have become aware of the

alleged infringement.”

The Petitioner in the instant application has not submitted any evidence on exceptional

circumstances occurred, which led to a late application of fundamental rights. And in the period

of nearly two years that has passed before filing this application, no evidence has been presented

regarding any other attempt by the Petitioner to question the legality of the tender in question.

While the Fundamental Rights are an integral part of the Constitution, it would be incorrect to

term them as unconditional. These rights, by the Constitution itself, are restricted by conditions

which aim to balance the individual freedom and rights to the necessity of public good and

10

welfare. In such a background, This Court cannot be justified to allow such an attempt to bring in

a fundamental rights application that has already time barred due to a limitation established by

the Constitution itself.

In the above circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection on time bar raised on behalf of

the Respondents and dismiss the Application of the Petitioner in limine.
