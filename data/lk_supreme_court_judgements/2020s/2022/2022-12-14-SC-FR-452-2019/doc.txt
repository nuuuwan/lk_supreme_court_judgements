Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner joined the 1st Respondent as a Clerk-Grade IV on 15.12.1983. During

her more than 30 years of service, she rose through the ranks and held the position

of Assistant Director (Administration) at the time of this application.

On 19.02.2016, the 1st Respondent requested internal candidates for the post of

Deputy Director (Human Resources). The Petitioner presented herself for the

interview on 24.03.2016. However, the 11th and 12th Respondents were selected

and appointed to the post of Deputy Manager (Human Resources).

The complaint of the Petitioner is against the interview process. The Petitioner

argues that she was assessed unfairly and was denied marks that prevented her

from being appointed to the position.

Time Bar

A time bar objection has been raised by the 1st Respondent.

In terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, a fundamental rights application must

be filed within one month of the infringement. In Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and

Others [(1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 384 at 402] Fernando J. held:

“Three principles are thus discernible in regard to the operation of the time

limit prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the infringement

takes place; if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other

instances by comparison with which the treatment meted out to him becomes

Page 8 of 13

discriminatory), time begins to run only when both infringement and

knowledge exist (Siriwardena v. Rodrigo (2). The pursuit of other remedies,

judicial or administrative, does not prevent or interrupt the operation of the

time limit. While the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases, on the

application of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse,

fault or, delay on the part of the petitioner, this Court has a discretion to

entertain an application made out of time.”

It was submitted on behalf of the 1st Respondent that the Petitioner should have

filed this application within one month of the promotions being given to the 11th

and 12th Respondents. In the alternative, it was contended that the application

should have been filed within one month of the date on which the report of the 16th

Respondent was received by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner claims of becoming aware of the promotions of the 11th and 12th

Respondents only around 3rd June 2016. This information was conveyed to her by

the Shihabdeen Mohammed Faum, then Acting Deputy Manager (Sales) of the 1st

Respondent. An affidavit of Shihabdeen Mohammed Faum has been annexed to

the petition (P8) in which he corroborates the Petitioner's version. The 1st

Respondent, other than simply denying this assertion, did not adduce any evidence

to the contrary.

In these circumstances, I am inclined to accept the version of the Petitioner more

so as she was admittedly working in the Kandy Regional Office of the 1st Respondent

at the relevant time. Hence the one month must start from 3rd June 2016.

This application was filed on 14th November, 2019. Nevertheless, the Petitioner had

filed an application with the 16th Respondent on 9th June 2016. In terms of section

13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996, where a

complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14 to the Commission,

within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement of a

fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the period within which

Page 9 of 13

the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the Commission, shall not be

taken into account in computing the period of one month within which an

application may be made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

The Court has interpreted this provision and the jurisprudence establishes the

following principles:

(a) The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka within one month of the alleged infringement

is sufficient to get the benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 [Romesh Coorey v

Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles v. Road Passenger Services Authority of

the Western Province, (S.C.F.R. 448/2009, S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].

(b) However, the correct position is that a petitioner must show evidence that

the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has conducted an inquiry

regarding the complaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a

complaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe v. Inspector General of Police, SC (Spl)

16/1999, S.C.M. 11.09.2000; Kariyawasam v. Southern Provincial Road

Development Authority and 8 Others, (2007) 2 Sri.L.R. 33; Ranaweera and

Others v. Sub-Inspector Wilson Siriwardene and Others (2008) 1 Sri.L.R. 260;

K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, S.C.M. 10.01.2018);

Wanasinghe v. Kamal Paliskara and Others, (S.C.F.R. 216/2014, S.C.M.

23.06.2021)].

(c) A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 where the complaint to

the Human Rights Commission is made one month after the alleged violation

[Alagaratnam Manoranjan v. G.A. Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern

Province, (S.C.F.R. 261/2013, S.C.M. 11.09.2014)]

Page 10 of 13

(d) The provisions of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

Act No. 21 of 1996 is not available to a petitioner who has made a complaint

to the Human Rights Commission only to obtain an advantage by bringing his

application within Article 126(2) of the Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer

Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)]

In this case, the evidence establishes that the Petitioner made a complaint to the

16th Respondent on 9th June 2016 and that a recommendation was made on 16th

September 2019 directing the 1st Respondent to grant the Petitioner her due

promotion on or before 22nd October, 2019. As a result, the Petitioner is entitled to

the benefit of subsection 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act

No. 21 of 1996.

Nevertheless, the 1st Respondent submitted that the application should have been

filed within one month of the date on which the recommendation of the 16th

Respondent was received by the Petitioner. This submission is simply untenable.

Where a party has made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission against an

alleged infringement or imminent infringement within one month of the alleged

infringement or imminent infringement and the Human Rights Commission has

begun an inquiry, the time for the purposes of Article 126(2) of the Constitution

stops running. The aggrieved party may then invoke the jurisdiction of this Court

after one month from the deadline set by the Human Rights Commission for

compliance with its recommendation.

Admittedly, the Petitioner received the recommendation of the 16th Respondent

on 20th September, 2019. Nevertheless, the Human Rights Commission had given

the 1st Respondent time until 22nd October, 2019 to implement the

recommendation. There was no compulsion on the Petitioner to come before Court

before the expiry of the time given to the 1st Respondent to implement the

recommendation.

Page 11 of 13

The 14th Respondent, General Manager of the 1st Respondent, by letter dated 17th

October 2019 informed the 16th Respondent, with copy to the Petitioner, that the

recommendation of the 16th Respondent cannot be implemented for the reasons

mentioned. The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on 15th November,

2019, within one month of the date given to the 1st Respondent to implement the

recommendation of the 16th Respondent and within one month of the intimation

that the recommendation cannot be implemented, whichever is considered.

Accordingly, I find that the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of the Court

within the prescribed period.

Interview Process

The affidavit of Mohammed Faum, then Acting Deputy Manager (Sales) of the 1st

Respondent (P8) explains the contents of the discussion he had with the then

Chairman of the 1st Respondent P. Dissanayake. This evidence supports the

Petitioner's case that the interview procedure was flawed. The 11th Respondent

was given the promotion as he was due to go on retirement. The 12th Respondent

was given the promotion as she was making persistent requests for the promotion.

This was made possible by giving both of them the full marks given for personality

demonstrated at the interview. It is not common for a current employee to give

evidence against the employer in support of a co-worker. I see no reason to doubt

this evidence.

The 1st Respondent has failed to adduce any evidence to contrary. Neither the mark

sheet nor the evidence of the interview panel was produced. Instead, the 1st

Respondent has sought to establish that the service record of the Petitioner is

unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, as correctly observed by the Human Rights

Commission, the Petitioner has been awarded the full 15 marks for Service

Evaluation. This is not possible without a satisfactory service record.

Page 12 of 13

The 1st Respondent also filed several documents dated June 2016 and thereafter to

try and establish misconduct on the part of the Petitioner. They are irrelevant to

the matter before the Court as the interview was conducted on 24th March 2016.

The Petitioner alleges that these documents were issued after she went to the

Human Rights Commission in order to penalize her for doing so. There seems to be

some truth in this allegation.

According to the findings of the Human Rights Commission, the Petitioner had

obtained a total of 80 marks at the interview as follows:

Experience - 30 marks (maximum 30)

Educational Qualifications - 25 marks (maximum 30)

Service Record - 15 marks (maximum 15)

Personality demonstrated at the interview - 10 marks (maximum 25)

The 11th Respondent received a total of 85 marks and the 12th received a total of 84

marks. Both had ultimately received more marks than the Petitioner because of the

marks they had obtained for personality demonstrated at the interview. The

Petitioner obtained more marks for all the other categories than the 11th and 12th

Respondents. This evidence corroborates the uncontradicted evidence of

Mohammed Faum, then Acting Deputy Manager (Sales) of the 1st Respondent.

In this case, meritocracy had given way to kakistocracy. The decision to promote

the 11th and 12th Respondents instead of the Petitioner has been taken on

extraneous considerations and hence is arbitrary.

Accordingly, I declare that the 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights

guaranteed to the Petitioner in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution by failing

to give her the due promotion.

Page 13 of 13

In the exercise of the just and equitable jurisdiction conferred on Court in terms of

Article 126(4) of the Constitution, I make the following directions:

(a) The Petitioner should be promoted as Deputy Manager (Human Resources)

with effect from the date on which the same promotion was granted to the

11th and 12th Respondents. If the 11th and 12th Respondents were promoted

on two different dates, the promotion of the Petitioner should be made

effective from the earliest date.

(b) In the event that there are no cadre vacancies, the promotion of the

Petitioner as Deputy Manager (Human Resources) should be made as being

personal to her. There is no need for the 1st Respondent to obtain the

approval of any other body to give effect to this direction of Court.

(c) The Petitioner is entitled to all the back wages and other monetary and non-

monetary emoluments which is made to Deputy Manager (Human

Resources).

(d) The Petitioner is entitled to all statutory dues from the date of her promotion

as Deputy Manager (Human Resources).

The 1st Respondent shall in addition, pay Rs. 1,00,000/= as costs of this application

to the Petitioner.
