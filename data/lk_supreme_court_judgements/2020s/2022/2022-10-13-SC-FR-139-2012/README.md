Judgement

Aluwihare PC. J.,

(1) The 1st Petitioner, Mahapitiya Gedera Shanuka Gihan Karunaratne and

the 2nd Petitioner, Purijjala Puwakpitiyegedara Amila Dilshan

Puwakpitiya, being minors, invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction

4

of this Court through their next friends, Mahapitiya Gedera Ananda

Karunaratne and Purijjala Puwakpitiyegedara Neeladasa Puwakpitiya

respectively. The Petitioners by way of this application challenge, inter

alia, the torture and/or cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment or

treatment meted out to them by the 1st Respondent by severely caning

them and causing injuries in violation of the Circulars of the Ministry of

Education and thereby violating their fundamental rights guaranteed

under Article 11 and further violating their fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution for having meted

out corporal punishment on them.

(2) This Court granted leave to proceed against the 1st Respondent for the

alleged violation of the Petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution. Leave to proceed was also

granted against the 3rd Respondent for the alleged violation of the

Petitioners' fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution.

(3) The Petitioners had complained of inaction, on the part of the 3rd

Respondent [the Officer -in-Charge of Mahawela Police station] as he

had failed to take any action against the 1st Respondent for alleged

assault. During the hearing of this Application, however, it was brought

to the attention of the Court that the 3rd Respondent, had in fact taken

steps to file action against the 1st Respondent in the magistrate’s court of

Naula, based on the complaint made against him by the Petitioners and

as such, it was intimated on behalf of the Petitioners that they do not wish

to pursue the reliefs sought against the 3rd Respondent. Therefore, this

court is left to decide, as to whether the 1st Respondent had committed

the alleged violation.

The Facts

(4) The 1st and 2nd Petitioners were students of Veera Keppetipola Madya

Maha Vidyalaya, Pallepola, Akuramboda at the time of the incident.

5

(5) According to the Petitioners, on the day in question [24th October 2011],

during school hours, the Petitioners together with some classmates were

chatting under the mango tree, in close proximity to the school dining

hall. Some others who were unknown to the Petitioners had pelted stones

at a mango tree. Some stones had strayed and damaged a few glass panes

of a building which housed the said dining hall.

(6) The 1st Respondent was the Deputy Principal of the school, who was

acting for the principal who was on leave on that day. The 1st Respondent

states that on being informed by the acting Matron of the girls’ hostel

that she had heard the shattering of the glass panes of the dining hall,

the 1st Respondent had gone to inspect the said hall and found around

fifteen students bustling inside and outside the hall. The 1st Respondent

states that he apprehended three students and upon questioning them,

came to the conclusion that the 1st and 2nd Petitioners were the main

instigators. Thereafter the 1st Respondent had wanted the Petitioners to

meet him at his office.

(7) The 1st Petitioner states that his colleagues and he, ran away on seeing

the 1st Respondent near the said dining hall and went to their respective

classrooms. While the 1st Petitioner was in the science laboratory, a

classmate named Premaratne informed the 1st Petitioner that the 1st

Respondent had wanted all of them to meet him. Thereafter the 1st

Petitioner, Premaratne and two other classmates who had been with

them under the mango tree, namely Edward and Wasantha, proceeded

to the school office.

(8) When the 1st Petitioner arrived at the office, he had seen the 2nd

Petitioner and another student, kneeling near the office door. According

to the 1st petitioner, the 2nd Petitioner was crying and appeared to be in

severe pain.

(9) The 1st Petitioner has averred that the 1st Respondent came out from the

office and asked him; “who is Karunaratne?”. When the 1st Petitioner

stated that it was he, the 1st Respondent had administered four cuts with

6

a cane on his buttocks and then caned the other students who had

accompanied him to the school office.

(10) The 1st Petitioner claims that he was thereafter taken to the corridor

outside the office and was asked whether he broke the window. When

he intimated that he was not responsible for the incident and that he was

unaware as to who was responsible for the damage caused to the

windows, the 1st Respondent had again caned the 1st Petitioner on his

buttocks. Due to the force of the assault, the 1st Petitioner states that he

fell to the ground, and begged the 1st Respondent not to hit him.

Disregarding his pleas the1st Respondent had continued to cane him on

the back of his chest and shoulders. The 1st Petitioner further claims that

the 1st Respondent continued to cane him, till the cane broke.

(11) The 1st Petitioner’s version as to the assault, is supported by the Affidavits

of two other students who had accompanied the 1st Petitioner to the

school office, namely Manoj Priyankara Premaratne (‘P1’) and Wasantha

Jayalath Wickramasinghe (‘P2’).

The version of the 2nd Petitioner

(12) Following the incident [of pelting stones], the 2nd Petitioner had returned

to his classroom and had observed the 1st Respondent leading away some

students. The 2nd Petitioner states that, a little while later, the 1st

Respondent had come to his classroom with a student named Wijeweera

and had inquired as to who Puwakpitiya was. The 2nd Petitioner had

stood up and the 1st Respondent then had asked him to collect his bag

and to come to his office.

(13) The 2nd Petitioner relates that at the office, the 1st Respondent had gone

through his bag and had asked him whether he broke the window. When

the 2nd Petitioner answered in the negative, the 1st Respondent had rudely

remarked in response; ‘Do you think this is your mother’s and father’s

inheritance’.

(14) The 2nd Petitioner claims that the 1st Respondent then had dealt him

several blows on the back of his chest and the shoulders with a cane and

that some strokes had also alighted on his arms causing him immense

7

pain. After the beating, the 2nd Petitioner had been forced to kneel on the

ground near the office door and the unbearable pain made him cry.

(15) Following the assault on him, the 2nd Petitioner alleges that the 1st

Respondent proceeded to hit another student named Kumara and

demanded from him, the names of the other students who were near the

dining hall. Kumara had then given the names of the 1st Petitioner and

of the students, Edward and Wasantha.

(16) The 2nd Petitioner claims that the 1st Respondent hit the 1st Petitioner,

Edward and Wasantha when they arrived at the office. He further states

that he saw the 1st Respondent taking the 1st Petitioner to the corridor

and that he heard the 1st Petitioner pleading with him not to hit him.

(17) The 1st Respondent thereafter had approached the 2nd Petitioner to cane

him as well, but was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. The

Petitioners state that when the 1st Respondent returned after answering

the phone, he had written down the names of the Petitioners and the

other students who were present and had retorted, “this is the last day,

if you have money, do whatever you can and show me, go to Court or

the Police or any place you want”, and ordered that they get back to

their respective classrooms.

(18) The Petitioners state that the assault occurred in the presence of other

members of staff and students which caused them a great deal of

humiliation.

The version of the 1st Respondent

(19) The 1st Respondent had admitted the fact that he caned the Petitioners.

[Paragraph 10 of the statement of objections]. The relevant portion of the

said paragraph is as follows; “The 1st Respondent… states that he warned

the students for damaging the said windows and when he wanted to cane

them on their palms all of them refused to raise their palms and therefore

the 1st Respondent caned them on their buttocks and sent them to their

respective classes.” The 1st Respondent has further reaffirmed this in

paragraph 11 of his Affidavit.

8

(20) The Petitioners state that, as a result of the caning, they were in immense

pain and informed their parents about the assault using the telephone

facility available at a cooperative store. Their parents had arrived at the

school premises and having informed the respective class teachers about

the thrashing, had taken the Petitioners out of the school at around 11.30

am. The parents, thereafter, had lodged complaints at the Mahawela

Police station regarding the incident.

(21) 1st Respondent too had made a complaint at the Mahawela Police station

alleging that a group of Grade 11 students had pelted stones at the roof

and at the windows of the dining hall of the girls’ hostel and had caused

damage to the school buildings. In the statement the made to the police

[3R4], the 1st Respondent has stated that he admonished the students who

were allegedly involved in the incident.

(22) The Petitioners had been admitted to the District Hospital, Matale on 24th

October 2011 for treatment of the injuries sustained and had been

treated as ‘in-house patients’ till 26th October 2011. The Petitioners had

been subjected to a medical examination which revealed that the 1st

Petitioner had sustained two contusions over the posterior chest wall and

contusions over the lateral aspect of both thighs (P3) while the 2nd

Petitioner was found to have sustained multiple contusions and

abrasions over the posterior chest wall and abrasions over the right

posterior-lateral aspect of the upper arm. (P4). The 1st Petitioner was also

treated for anxiety and adjustment disorder (P3a).

(23) The Petitioners had been examined by the Judicial Medical Officer as

well on 26th October 2011. As per the medico-legal reports (P5 and P6)

the injuries sustained by both Petitioners were recorded as consistent

with the Petitioners being assaulted with a linear rigid weapon with a

circular shaped cross section similar to a cane. The judicial medical

officer has also made an observation that the appearance of the injuries

is consistent with the history given by the injured. The extent of the

physical harm caused to the bodies [the injuries] of the Petitioners is

9

amply demonstrated by the photographs marked and produced as P8 (a)

and P8(b).

(24) Subsequent to the filing of this application the Petitioners and five other

students of the school had been prosecuted by the Police before the Naula

Magistrate’s Court for having caused mischief. All seven students had

pleaded guilty to the charge and the learned Magistrate, without

proceeding to convict them had warned and discharged them and had

ordered each of them to pay Rs. 1000/-as state costs.

(25) The 1st Respondent contends that the punishments which were of

‘disciplinary’ nature were vindicated by the fact that the petitioners

accepted liability. The 1st Respondent further contends that he had had

no intention of subjecting the Petitioners to cruel and inhuman treatment

or punishment and acted in good faith with the objective of maintaining

discipline in the school and with the intention of discouraging such

behaviour among the students, in the future. Furthermore, the 1st

Respondent strongly denies that he caned the Petitioners in the manner

alleged by them and refutes the allegation that the injuries of the

Petitioners were as a result of his caning.

Violation of Article 12 (1)

(26) It was contended on behalf of the Petitioners that, as per Circular No.

2005/17 dated 11th May 2005 issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education, that there is a total prohibition on the infliction of corporal

punishments on students in government schools as a disciplinary

measure. It is the Petitioners’ position that the 1st Respondent by his

blatant violation of the said Circular, has violated their fundamental

rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

(27) The decision to issue the circular banning corporal punishment from our

schools as a form of discipline, undoubtedly would have been taken after

careful study by the relevant authorities of its adverse impacts on a child

based on medical studies.

10

(28) In addition, international instruments relating to the rights of children

to which Sri Lanka became a signatory or a party also may have

influenced the decision to ban corporal punishment in schools as Sri

Lanka is bound to discharge its obligation to the international

community.

(29) Research had shown that corporal punishment is less effective than other

methods of behaviour management in schools, and "praise, discussions

regarding values, and positive role models do more to develop character,

respect, and values than does corporal punishment". They say that

evidence links corporal punishment of students to a number of adverse

outcomes, including: "increased aggressive and destructive behaviour,

increased disruptive classroom behaviour, vandalism, poor school

achievement, poor attention span, increased drop-out rate, school

avoidance and school phobia, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic

complaints, depression, suicide and retaliation against teachers". What

is recommended are a number of alternatives to corporal punishment,

including various nonviolent behaviour-management strategies,

modifications to the school environment, and increased support for

teachers.

(30) Steven R. Poole in a joint Article “The Role of the Paediatrician in

Abolishing Corporal Punishment in Schools” [1st July 1991 PEDEATRICS]

says;

“A number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued

statements opposing all forms of corporal punishment in schools, citing

such outcomes as poorer academic achievements, increases in antisocial

behaviour, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning

environment.”

The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has defined

corporal punishment as; “any punishment in which physical force is

used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however

light.”

11

(31) Sri Lanka became a signatory to The United Nations Convention on the

Rights of the Child, [herein after the UNCRC] on 26th January 1990 and

ratified it on it 12th July 1991, thus furthering its commitment towards

protecting and upholding the rights of the child. With respect to

discipline, Article 28 of the UNCRC has laid down fundamental

standards to be followed in formulating school disciplinary policies. The

said Article requires all States Parties to take “all appropriate measures

to ensure that school discipline is administered in a manner consistent

with the child's human dignity and in conformity with the present

Convention.”

(32) This Article must be read in conjunction with Article 19 of the UNCRC

which states that state parties should take, “all appropriate legislative,

administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from

all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or

negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual

abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other

person who has the care of the child.”

(33) The infliction of corporal punishment has been condemned by numerous

international instruments, in particular the UNCRC, as being violative of

the rights of the child to human dignity and physical integrity. In 2006

the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, the

international body charged with monitoring compliance with the

UNCRC, issued General Comment 8, discussing the right of the child to

protection from corporal punishment. The Committee drew the

conclusion that Article 19 of the UNCRC; “does not leave room for any

level of legalized violence against children. Corporal punishment and

other cruel or degrading forms of punishment are forms of violence and

States must take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and

educational measures to eliminate them.”

(34) With reference to Article 28 of the UNCRC, the Committee also noted

that corporal punishment “directly conflicts with the equal and

12

inalienable rights of children to respect for their human dignity and

physical integrity.”

(35) The negative perception of corporal punishment has been recognised by

many other international instruments and conventions. For instance, the

Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the body charged

with overseeing the International Covenant on Economic, Social and

Cultural Rights (ICESCR), states in General Comment 13 (on the right to

education) as follows;

“In the Committee’s view, corporal punishment is inconsistent with the

fundamental guiding principle of international human rights law

enshrined in the Preambles to the Universal Declaration and both

Covenants: the dignity of the individual.” (UN Committee on Economic,

Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 13, Article 13, The Right

to Education, UN Doc. E/C.12/1999/10 (1999), para. 41.[Emphasis is

mine]

(36) The Ministry of Education in its endeavour to discourage the practice of

corporal punishment in National schools, had issued the Circular No.

2005/17 dated 11th May 2005, containing provisions which are

consonant with the principles enunciated relating to corporal

punishment in the international instruments referred to earlier. The

Petitioners, in substantiating their case, relied on the said circular. It was

submitted that the circular was promulgated with the intention of

fostering a school environment in which corporal punishment is

eliminated and replaced by more conducive methods of disciplining

students having regard to their inherent dignity, physical integrity, as

well as their mental well-being. The Circular acknowledges the rise in

the abuse of school children at the hands of academic as well as non-

academic staff and states that in light of the global movement towards

promoting and protecting the rights of the child there can be no leeway

for children to be subjected to any form of harassment or abuse in

schools.

13

(37) Paragraph 2.0 of the aforesaid Circular which is titled ‘Physical

Punishment’, states that school principals and teachers should not inflict

corporal punishments on students. Paragraph 2.1 lists out the negative

effects of corporal punishment on children, for example, that it increases

the chances of child abuse, leads to increased child aggression and anti-

social behaviour, has a negative effect on a child’s cognitive functioning,

self-regulation and social-emotional development. It is also noted in the

Circular that if a teacher is incapable of disciplining a student without

resorting to corporal punishment, it is a clear indication of that teacher’s

weak disciplinary capability.

(38) The Circular not only places a blanket prohibition on corporal

punishment, but by Paragraph 2.2 lists alternative and positive methods

of discipline such as informing the students of the school rules and

clearly setting out what is expected of them, providing proper guidance

and counseling, advising the child on his wrongdoings and/or informing

the child’s parents/guardian, suspending the student for a maximum of

2 weeks in the case of serious misdemeanors upon verification by an

inquiry.

(39) Paragraph 2.3 sets out the legal consequences of resorting to corporal

punishment. It is specifically stated that corporal punishments on

students will give rise to a cause of action with respect to the

infringement of fundamental rights under Article 11 of Chapter III and

Article 126 of Chapter XVI of the Constitution. A cause of action may

also arise with respect to the offence of cruelty to children in terms

Section 308A of the Penal Code as well. It is further stated that the

teacher concerned would be liable to disciplinary action by the Education

Ministry under the Establishment Code if it is proved that he/she had

resorted to corporal punishment.

(40) The 1st Respondent admitted that he caned the students and the

consequent physical and mental trauma experienced by the Petitioners

as evidenced by their medical reports support the inference that they

were indeed subjected to corporal punishment.

14

(41) The 1st Respondent’s assertion is that he did not act out of malice and

had no intention of subjecting the Petitioners to cruel and inhuman

treatment and tried to act within the limits of the Circular and followed

Paragraph 2.2, which provides alternative methods to discipline

students. He has even attempted to justify his decision to cane the

Petitioners by arguing that the reason why he did not follow Section 2.2

of the Circular and suspend the Petitioners was due to the fact that they

were about to sit for their Ordinary Level Examination and he did not

wish for their studies to be hampered. He also claims in his Affidavit

(1R9) that it is his firm belief that the Circular can only be followed with

respect to activities within the classroom and that the Circular cannot be

solely depended on and followed, with respect to illegal activities that

occur inside or outside the classroom.

(42) The arguments made on behalf of the 1st Respondent neither mitigates

nor diminishes the gravity of his action. Furthermore, the views formed

by the1st Respondent regarding the laws and regulations that regulate his

duties and responsibilities as a teacher attached to the State sector, cannot

in any way be regarded as an excuse for his actions. All evidence suggests

that he has clearly violated the guidelines laid down by the Circular, in

particular Section 2.00. I am unable to accept the assertion of the 1st

Respondent that the impugned acts on the part of the 1st Respondent

involved disciplinary action not violative of fundamental rights.

(43) In the present case the action of the 1st Respondent not only is a clear

violation of the relevant circular, but also tantamount to the commission

of an offence under Section 308A of the Penal Code. As held in the case

of Reddiar v. Van Houten and Others (1988)1 SLR 265, violation of a

circular applicable to a citizen, amounts to the violation of the Article 12

(1). Therefore, it can be held that the violation of Circular No. 2005/17

by the 1st Respondent amounts to a violation of the Petitioners’

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

15

Violation of Article 11

(44) The Petitioners claim that the merciless assault by the 1st Respondent

which left them with multiple injuries as well as mental trauma and

suffering, amounts to torture and/or cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment, and as such the action of the 1st Respondent

violated their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the

Constitution.

(45) Article 11 of the Constitution declares the right to be free from torture.

It reads; “No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment.”

Article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman

or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, defines torture as “any act by

which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is

intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from

him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an

act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having

committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any

reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering

is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence

of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does

not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental

to lawful sanctions.”

(46) Article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child

[UNCRC] imposes an obligation on state parties to protect children from

torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment

and the said Article stipulates; “State Parties shall ensure that: (a) No

child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading

treatment or punishment.”

(47) In addition to the UNCRC, there are numerous international instruments

by which states are under an obligation to protect the child’s right to be

free from any form of physical violence. These international conventions

16

guarantee that the fundamental rights of the child encompass protection

against all forms of torture and inhuman and degrading activities. For

instance, Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

Rights delineates; “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of

person” and both the Article 7 of the ICCPR as well as the Article 5 of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, “No one shall be

subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment.”

(48) In the instant case, it has been established that the Petitioners suffered

injuries due to the corporal punishment meted out by the 1st Respondent.

As discussed earlier, within the context of human rights, corporal

punishment can be perceived as a violation of children’s fundamental

right to physical integrity and human dignity. Thus, it can be regarded

as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and could even amount to

physical abuse and/or torture if administered frequently and severely.

(49) The jurisprudence developed over time has recognized that corporal

punishment can amount to a violation of Article 11 of the Constitution.

In the case of Bandara v. Wickremasinghe (1995) 2 SLR 167 in which

the Petitioner, a school student had been assaulted during school hours

by the Deputy Principal, Vice Principal and a teacher, Kulatunga J.

observed that “the discipline of students was a matter within the purview

of school teachers and that whenever they act with the objective of

maintaining discipline, they act under the colour of office. Therefore, if

in doing so, they exceed their power, they may become liable for the

infringement of fundamental rights by executive and administrative

action.”

(50) Another conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the State cannot

deny responsibility with respect to the actions of a civil servant done

under the colour of office. As was held in Lister v. Hesley Hall [2002] 1

AC 215, vicarious liability can arise for unauthorized, intentional

wrongdoings committed by an employee acting for his own benefit, in so

17

far as there exists a connection between the wrongdoings and the work

for which he was employed to render it within the scope of

employment. In the instant case, the 1st Respondent caned the Petitioners

during school hours, within the school premises. One of the duties of the

1st Respondent was to maintain school discipline and therefore the fact

that he abused his authority does not sever the connection with his

employment. There exists a sufficient connection between the duties of

the 1st Respondent and the abuse he committed to render it within the

scope of employment. Accordingly, the State cannot evade liability.

(51) Children constitute a unique category given their dependency on others,

their state of development, their maturity as well as their vulnerability.

Therefore, they require a higher degree of protection from all forms of

violence. This Court has been conscious of the natural disposition of a

child when deciding cases regarding an alleged violation of Article 11 of

the Constitution.

(52) For instance, Kulatunga J in the case of Bandara v. Wickremasinghe

(supra) acknowledged the fact that harsh disciplinarian tactics which

involve the excessive use of force would also have a detrimental impact

on the mental constitution of a child. His Lordship observed that in

granting relief, the Court must “reassure the petitioner that the

humiliation inflicted on him has been removed, and his dignity is

restored. That would in some way guarantee his future mental health,

which is vital to his advancement in life.”

(53) In a similar vein, it was observed in the case of Wijesinghe Chulangani

vs. Waruni Bogahawatte SC FR App No. 677/2012 (Supreme Court

minutes; 12th June 2019) that while it is established law that in addition

to a high degree of certainty, that a very high degree of maltreatment is

also required to make a finding on cruel, inhumane, degrading treatment

under Article 11, “… what amounts to a ‘high degree of maltreatment’

in relation to an adult does not always resonate with the mental

18

constitution of a minor. Therefore, when a minor complains of degrading

treatment, the Court as the upper guardian must not be quick to dismiss

the claims for failing to meet the same high threshold of maltreatment.

Instead, it must carefully consider the impact the alleged treatment may

have had on the mentality and the growth of the child.”

(54) Therefore, it is clear that in instances where a child has allegedly been

subjected to torture and/or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment, the approach adopted by the Court in examining and

weighing the alleged violation should be influenced by the fact that the

victim is a growing child whom the law and society as a whole must

protect at all times from all forms of violence.

(55) In the instant case, despite the 1st Respondent’s assertion that he did not

intend to harm the Petitioners and was solely acting with the aim of

preventing further damage being caused to school property, the medical

evidence placed before this Court supports the Petitioners’ version of

events and establishes that the impugned uninhibited assault was both

violent, degrading and had a detrimental impact on the physical and

mental wellbeing of the Petitioners. The 1st Respondent acting under the

colour of office, had clearly exceeded his powers as a disciplinarian and

subjected the Petitioners to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or

punishment in violation of Article 11 of the Constitution.

(56) For the reasons set out above, I hold that the Petitioners have succeeded

in establishing an infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed

by Article 12(1) and 11 of the Constitution by the 1st Respondent. There

is no material before this court to come to such a finding against any of

the other Respondents cited in this application.

19

In the circumstances of the case, I make order directing the 1st

Respondent to pay a sum of Rs.75,000 each to 1st and 2nd Petitioners. I

further direct the State to pay the 1st and 2nd Petitioners a sum of Rs.

25,000 each as compensation.
