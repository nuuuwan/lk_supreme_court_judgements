PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT- RESPONDENT

L.T.B Dehideniya J.,

The Plaintiff- Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred as the Respondent) instituted this action in the District Court seeking for

ejectment of the Defendant- Appellant- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called

and referred as the Appellant) and the damages. The Appellant was the tenant of

the Respondent. The Appellant and the Respondent both were limited liability

companies registered under the Companies Act. The Appellant came into the

occupation as a tenant prior to the September 2003. These facts were admitted by

the parties, and the Respondent further admitted that he received the quit notice.

Both parties admitted that the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 as amended, is in operation

of the area where the premises described in the schedule to the plaint was situated.

The Plaintiff’s case is that the Minister has issued the Extra Ordinary Gazette

Notification No. 1305/17 of 09th September 2003 declaring that if the landlord or

the tenant is a company registered under the Companies Act, the said premises

become exempted premises. Since the Petitioner and the Respondent both are

limited liability companies registered under the Companies Act, the Plaintiff’s

contention is that the premises in suit becomes an excepted premises.

At the beginning of the trial two preliminary issues of law were raised,

05. (c) Do those regulations (in Gazette No. 1305/17 of 09-09-2003

act retrospectively?

(d) If not, is the premises in suit not an excepted premises?

(e) Hence can the Plaintiff have and maintain this action?

4

11. (a) Is it only for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the

provision and principles of the Rent Act that regulations could

be made under Section 43(1) of the Rent act ?

(b) Is the protection granted to a rent controlled premises a

preliminary principle of the Rent Act?

(c) If the aforesaid regulation relied on by the Plaintiff receives

retrospective effect, can the aforesaid regulations remove the

protection enjoyed by the tenant?

(d) If the above issues “a”, “b”, “c” are answered in favour of the

defendant is the authority granted under Section 43(1) of the

Rent Act to make the aforesaid regulations rendered Ultra

Virus and not enforceable or effectual at law.

(e) If so can the Plaintiff ever have and maintain this action?

The District Court held in negative to issues No. 5 and decided that the action can

proceed. For issue No. 11, held positive and allowed the plaintiff to maintain the

action.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Defendant – Appellant appealed to the Court of

Appeal and the said appeal has been dismissed. Being aggrieved by the said order

of the Court of Appeal, the Appellant presented this appeal.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law.

1) Was the Court of Appeal in coming to conclusion that the regulations were

prospective in their application, in error in proceeding on the contrary basis

that the regulations would cover the tenancy in this case and that therefore

the Plaintiff was entitled to invoke the regulations to eject the Defendant

from the premises in suit?

5

2) Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider the fact that the rule

making power conferred by a statute on any public functionary should be

exercised strictly within the ambit of the powers conferred by the statutes

and, any rule or regulation which falls outside the powers conferred or is

inconsistent with/repugnant thereto would be ultra vires?

3) Did the Court of Appeal err in coming to conclusion that the Regulation

in question would cover those tenancies where the tenant had been a

company and the tenancy commenced before the said regulation was

published on the purported basis that the rights of the parties are decided

as at the date of the action?

The main issue in this case is whether the Extra Ordinary Gazette Notification

No. 1305/17 of 09.09.2003 is applicable to the premises in suit or not.

The Rent Act applies only to the premises where it has been declared that it

applies. The Act may not apply to certain premises which belongs to certain

persons. Section 2 of the Rent act specifies the applicability of the Act. Section

2(4) specifies the premises on which this Act does not apply. Under Section 2(4)

(a), the Act does not apply to excepted premises, and under Sub Section 5, the

schedule to the Act shall have the effect for the purpose of determining the

premise which shall be excepted for the purpose of the Act.

Section 2(4)

So long as this Act is in operation in any area, the provisions of this Act

shall apply to all premises in that area, other than—

(a) excepted premises;

6

Section 2(5)

The regulations in the Schedule to this Act shall have effect for the purpose

of determining the premises which shall be excepted premises for the

purposes of this Act, and may be amended from time to time by regulation

made under Section 43.

This Sub Section 5 permits the Minister to amend the schedule by way of

regulations made under Section 43.

As per the scheme set out in the Rent Act, it applies only to certain premises and

certain premises were except from its application. The Legislature has declared

that certain premises were excepted and further permitted the Minister in charge

of the subject to amend the schedule of the excepted premises by publishing a

Gazette Notification. Under Section 43(1), the Minister may make all such

regulations, may be necessary for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to

the provisions and the principals of the Rent Act. Applying the Rent Act to certain

premises, as well as removing the applicability to the certain premises is a matter

of giving effect to the Rent Act. As I have stated above, the principal of the Rent

Act is to apply it only to certain premises and not to all rented premises.

Therefore, the Minister is authorized to amend the schedule by adding new items

or removing the existing items in the schedule.

The Minister, exercising his statutory powers, published the Extra Ordinary

Gazette Notification No. 1305/17 of 09.09.2003, removing the applicability of

the Rent Act on certain premises.

Under Sub Section 2 of Section 43, the Gazette comes into operation on the date

of the publication. It has to be presented to the Parliament under Sub Section 3,

7

and if the Parliament does not approve the regulation, it has to be published under

Sub Section 4. Under Sub Section 5, any Gazette Notification approved by the

Parliament becomes valid and effectual, as it was enacted by the Rent Act.

Therefore, the Gazette Notification dated 09.09.2003 becomes a law from the

date it was published.

Section 43

(1) The Minister may make all such regulations as may be necessary for

the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the provisions and principles

of this Act.

(2) Every regulation made by the Minister shall be published in the Gazette

and shall come into operation on the date of such publication or on such

later date as may be specified in the regulation.

(3) Every regulation made by the Minister shall, as soon as convenient

after its publication in the Gazette, be brought before the House of

Representatives for approval. Any regulation which is not so approved

shall be deemed to be rescinded as from the date of disapproval, but

without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.

(4) Notification of the date on which any regulation made by the Minister

is so deemed to be rescinded shall be published in the Gazette.

(5) Any regulation made by the Minister shall when approved by the House

of Representatives, be as valid and effectual as if it were herein enacted.

Notification of such approval shall be published in the Gazette.

8

The Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Gazette Notification cannot be

published with retrospective effect. He argued that the Appellant became the

tenant prior to the Gazette Notification; therefore, this Gazette Notification does

not apply to the Appellant. The Respondent agreed that the Gazette Notification

has no retrospective effect. Further the Court of Appeal also held that the said

Gazette Notification only has a prospective effect.

Under Section 43(2), the regulation made by the Minister shall be published in

the gazette and it shall come into the operation on date of such publication or on

such later date, as may he specified in the regulations. Under this Section, the

Minister was given authority to declare a later date than the date of publication

when the Gazette should come into operation. But Minister was not empowered

to declare a date anterior to the date which it was published.

As I have previously stated, the Rent Act applies to the premises only. It does not

apply to the persons or to the Contract of Tenancy. If the Rent Act applies to a

certain premises, then there would be some restrictions in terms of contract. The

Extra Ordinary Gazette Notification No. 1305/17 was published on 09.09.2003.

From that date onwards, the premises belong to a company or the tenant is a

company registered under the Companies Act, the Rent Act will not apply,

because it will be excepted premises from that date onwards. Parties may have

come into occupation or entered into rent agreement when the Rent Act was in

operation. When a Minister publishes a Gazette Notification declaring that the

said premises is excepted from that day onwards, the Rent Act will not apply to

the said premises. The Law is above the private contract.

In the case of Queen’s Bench decision in Baily VS De Crespigny 1861-73

A.E.R 332 a case related to covenant of landlord and tenant the Chief Justice

Cockburn held that,

9

“… in the absence of clear words showing contrary intention, parties

must always be considered as contracting with the law as existing at the

time of contract….”

Existing laws is interpreted in the Article 170 of The Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 1978,

“Article 170 of the Constitution –

“Existing law” and “existing written law” mean any law and written law,

respectively, in force immediately before the commencement of the

Constitution which under the Constitution continues in force;”

As referred to earlier form the evidence led at the trial, it demonstrates that

at a point of time the Rent Act was in operation both parties entered in to the rent

agreement. But after the publication of The Extra Ordinary Gazette Notification

No. 1305/17 said premises were except from the operation of the act and then

Rent Act will not be applied to such premises. So the existing law will be the

private contract law.

In the case of Peiris vs. Rathnabatthi Aratchy (50 NLR 138) it was

questioned about the commencement of tenancy before Ordinance came in to

operation. In this case Justice Basanayake held that,

“ I think it is clear from section 3(1) and 3(1A) of the ordinance that

regardless of the time which the tenancy commenced it is unlawful for any

land lord to demand, receive or recover and for any tenant to pay , or offer

to pay in respect of a period commencing on or after the date on which the

Ordinance came into operation in any area , any rent in excess of the rent

which may lawfully be received or paid under the Ordinance.

10

A retrospective status is a status that has affect from a date anterior to that

on which it becomes law…. The fact that the ordinance interference with

the future operation of existing contracts does not make it retrospective.

Where a statute affects an existing contract the contract must yield to the

status.”

Subsection (5) of Section 2 of the Rent Act declares that “The Regulation

in the schedule to this shall have effect for the purpose of determining the

premises which shall be excepted premises for the purpose of The Rent Act, and

may be altered from time to time by regulation made under Section 43,” The

aforementioned regulation No.1305/17, dated 2003.09.09, was introduced in

accordance with Section 43 read with Section 2(5) of the Act to amend the

Schedule to the Act in order to designate certain premises as "excepted premises."

The effective date of the regulation may be the date of publication of the

regulation, that is September 9, 2003.

“Section 43 (2),

Every regulation enacted by the Minister shall be published in the Gazette

and shall take effect on the date of such publication or on such later date

as the rule may specify."

As a result, the regulation's effective date is regarded to be 09th September 2003.

Since the premises become an excepted premises from that date, the Rent Act

does not apply to the said premises thereafter.

I will consider the rule-making power conferred in a public functionary by

a statute. The Subsection 2(5) of the Rent Act allows the Minister in charge of

the subject to change the schedule by issuing regulations under Section 43. The

11

scheme outlined in the Rent Act only applies to specific types of properties, and

certain types of properties have been exempted from its application. The

legislator declared that some premises were excepted, and the Minister in charge

of the Subject was given the authority to change the list of excepted premises by

publishing a Gazette notification. The Minister may make all necessary

regulations under section 43(1) for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to

the provisions of Rent Act. As a result, the Minister has the authority to change

the schedule by adding new premises or removing old ones.

According to Article 168 (4) of The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka 1978, the Minister has the power to amend, vary, rescind

or revoke such subordinate legislations.

“ 168 (4) Whenever the Constitution provides that any provision of any

existing written law shall continue in force until or unless Parliament

otherwise provides and the existing written law referred to consists of

subordinate legislation, the provision that such existing written law shall

continue in force until or unless Parliament otherwise provides shall not

in any manner be deemed to derogate from the power of the person or body

on whom the power to make and when made, to amend, vary, rescind or

revoke such subordinate legislation is conferred to exercise the power so

conferred until or unless Parliament otherwise provides.”

The Government Gazette (Publication) Ordinance of November 15, 1930

recognizes the Minister's power to issue gazettes on any matter or item with which

he is charged.

“Section 2(1) –

It shall be lawful for the Minister, after consulting the Minister of Justice,

by Order published in the Gazette, to declare that any provision of written

12

law with the administration of which he is charged and which requires that

any matter or thing, or any order, notification, list, statement, abstract,

notice, or other document, shall be published or proclaimed, or published

by Proclamation, in the Gazette, shall cease to be in force as from a date

to be specified in such Order.”

Based on the statutory facts cited above, it is evident that the Minister, in

exercising his statutory authority, issued Extraordinary Gazette Notification No.

1305/17 of 2003.09.09, deleting the Rent Act's application to a certain premise.

Another concern that has been put forward for determination by this Court

is "whether that the rights of the parties are decided as at the date of the action?”

In this regard, the date of the tenancy's commencement is significant. The date of

the aforementioned Regulation and the date on which the plaint in this case was

filed are pertinent. The parties acknowledge that the defendant leased the

premises in question in January 2003, before the said Regulation was enacted. On

09.09.2003 the Gazette was published. On 20th May 2005, the Plaintiff filed this

ejectment and damages action against the Respondent. The parties' rights are

determined at the time the action is filed, according to established law. Therefore,

by operation of law since 9th September 2003, the premises concerned becomes

an Excepted Premises and the tenancy is no longer no longer governed by the

Rent act.

“Cries statutes law 7th Edie page 387

“.... a statute is to be deemed to be retrospective which takes away

or impairs any vested right acquired under existing laws or creates new

obligations, or imposes new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to

transaction or considerations already past. But a statute is not properly

13

called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action

is drown from a time antecedent to its passing.

The Rent Act contains no provision stating that the regulations promulgated by

Gazette Extraordinary No. 1305/17 dated 2003.09.09 will apply retrospectively.

As a result, it is apparent that the regulations have no retrospective effect, and the

abovementioned regulations will take effect on 9th September 2003.

As a result, it is a widely acknowledged principle that parties' rights should

be determined according to the law in effect at the time of the action. It is also

determined in the case of Eastern Hardware Stores vs. J.S.Fernando 58 NLR 568.

Since the plaint was filed on 20.05.2005, the parties' rights in this dispute must

be determined based on the facts and law that existed at the time the action was

filed.

According to the existing law, if the landlord and the tenant are companies

registered under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982, the premises shall be an

excepted premises.

In the case of K.Mary Margret Fernando vs. Beeta De Silva (SC Appeal No. 193

of 2011), the issue is whether business premises located in the local authority's

territory are exempt. Which are referred to as "excepted premises" under the Rent

Act No. 7 of 1972, as amended. The Saleem Marsoof PC J held that,

“It is common ground that the time of institution of action the

property in suit was situated with in the local authority area of the

Anuradhapura Urban Council, and the relevant annual value for the

property to be regarded in law as excepted premises..”

The Gazette Notification amending the list of excepted premises was published

on 09th September 2003 and it becomes a law from that date. This action was

14

filled after the publication of the said Gazette Notification therefore that

amendment applies to the present case.

I answer the questions of law in the following way,

1) The regulations published by gazette notification No. 1305/17 of

09.09.2003 is not retrospective and the plaintiff is entitle to invoke the

regulations.

2) No

3) No

The appeal dismissed.
