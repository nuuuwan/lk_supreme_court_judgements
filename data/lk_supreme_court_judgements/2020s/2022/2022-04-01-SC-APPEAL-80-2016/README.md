Decided on : 1st of April, 2022

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

This is an appeal filed by the defendant-petitioner-appellant-appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the appellant) against the judgment of the High Court (Civil Appeal) of the North Western

Province holden in Kurunegala, which affirmed the order of the District Court of Chilaw

refusing the appellants application made under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the Code) to set aside the ex parte judgment entered

against him for failure to file the answer on the day fixed for filing the same.

Facts of the case

The plaintiff-respondent-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent)

had filed an action in the District Court claiming a sum of Rs. five million (Rs. 5,000,000/-) as

damages from the appellant for seduction.

On the 14th of December 2005, which was the first summons returnable date, the Attorney-at-

Law for the appellant (hereinafter referred to as the instructing attorney for the appellant)

had filed a proxy on behalf of the appellant and had moved for a date to file the answer.

Accordingly, the court had fixed the 01st of March, 2006 as the second date to file the answer.

However, on the 01st of March 2006, when the case was called to file the answer, the said

instructing attorney had moved for further time to file the answer. Hence, the court had fixed

the 17th of May, 2006 as the third date to file the answer.

When the case was called on the 17th of May 2006, neither the appellant nor the respondent

had been present in court. Further, the said instructing attorney had informed court that the

appellant had not given instructions despite the several reminders and the registered letter that

was sent to the appellant requesting for instructions to proceed with the trial.

As the appellant had failed to file the answer on the 17th of May 2006, the learned District

Judge had fixed the case for ex parte trial. At the ex parte trial held on the 22nd of May 2006,

the respondent had given evidence. Thereafter, considering the evidence given at the ex parte

trial, the learned District Judge had delivered an ex parte judgment on the 05th of July 2006, in

4

favour of the respondent and awarded a sum of Rs. five million in damages as prayed for in the

plaint, and a decree had been entered accordingly.

Subsequently, the appellant had filed an application in the District Court under section 86(2)

of the said Code to set aside the judgment and decree entered against him on the basis that he

had reasonable grounds for his default for not filing the answer on the answer due date.

During the inquiry held into the said application for purged default, whilst giving evidence, the

appellant had produced a letter dated the 20th of February 2006, marked as V1, whereby the

respondent had allegedly instructed her registered attorney to withdraw the action under

reference instituted against the appellant.

The appellant in his evidence had further stated that the said letter was given to him by the

respondent and that the appellant did not file his answer on the 17th of May, 2006 because he

believed that the said action would be withdrawn by the respondents instructing attorney as

per the instructions given to him in the said letter marked as V1.

Therefore, the appellant stated that he had reasonable grounds for his default in filing the

answer and that the ex parte judgment entered against him should be set aside in terms of

section 86(2) of the said Code.

Furthermore, the appellant stated that the respondent had not given any evidence during the

aforesaid purged default inquiry denying that she had given the said letter to her instructing

attorney requesting to withdraw the action. However, the proceedings of the purged default

inquiry revealed that the respondents lawyer had cross-examined the appellant at length. This

aspect is dealt with in detail under the subheading, submissions of the respondent.

At the conclusion of the said inquiry, the learned District Judge had delivered the order dated

the 25th of March 2009, refusing the appellants application for vacation of an ex parte

judgment on the ground that he had failed to satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds

for his default in terms of section 86(2) of the said Code. Aggrieved by the above order, the

appellant had appealed to the High Court.

5

Judgment of the High Court

After hearing the parties, the High Court held that the appellant had not satisfied the learned

District Judge that he had reasonable grounds for his failure to file the answer on the third date

fixed for filing the answer by court.

It was further held that, had the appellant believed that the action would be withdrawn as per

the said letter dated the 20th of February 2006, he would have given instructions to his

instructing attorney of the same. Particularly since his instructing attorney had sought

instructions from him.

The court further observed that, notwithstanding the said letter dated the 20th of February 2006,

the respondent had not withdrawn the action filed against the appellant on the 01st of March

2006, when the case was called to file the answer for the second time.

Furthermore, although the appellant was made aware of the fact that the court had granted a

further date to file the answer by his instructing attorney in writing and sought for instructions

from the appellant, he had nevertheless failed to give necessary instructions to his instructing

attorney.

Thereafter, the High Court held that it did not have any basis to interfere with the District Court

judgment as the defendant had not given sufficient reasons for his default.

Appeal to the Supreme Court

Being aggrieved by the aforementioned judgment of the High Court, the appellant appealed to

this court and was granted special leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

i. Does the evidence adduced at the inquiry before the District Court to vacate the ex parte

decree establish a reasonable ground for purging the default of the appellant within the

meaning of Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code contrary to the judgment of the

Civil Appeal High Court and the order of the learned Additional District judge?

ii. Have the learned judges of the Civil Appeal High Court erred in law in not considering

the fact that the respondent had in fact represented to the appellant that she had decided

to withdraw the said action and/or had given instructions to her Registered Attorney to

6

withdraw the action by the said letter dated 20/02/2006 marked V1, in interpreting

the term reasonable ground in section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code in the said

judgment?

Furthermore, the learned counsel for the respondent had raised the following question of law

at the time special leave was granted:

As this is not a revision application, can the quantum of damages awarded in the ex

parte decree be contested in these proceedings for purging default?

Submissions of the appellant

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant submitted that, in terms of section 86(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code, the appellant must satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds

for such default in order to get the judgment and decree entered against the appellant set aside

for default in filing the answer.

It was further submitted that the appellant did not file the answer on the 17th of May, 2006

because he had believed that the respondent would withdraw the said action instituted against

him in view of the said letter marked as V1. Therefore, it was submitted that he had

reasonable grounds for his default.

Further, it was contended that the term reasonable grounds in the said subsection 86(2) of

the said Code should be interpreted by applying a subjective test in lieu of an objective one,

which the District Court and High Court had failed to do.

In support of the above submission, the learned Presidents Counsel cited Kala Traders (Pvt)

Limited v Sanicoch Group of Companies S.C. (C.H.C.) Appeal No.08/2010 SC Minutes 02nd

October, 2015, where it was held:

Section 86(2) of the Code contemplates of a liberal approach emphasising the

aspect of reasonableness as opposed to a rigid standard of proof Much

emphasis needs to be placed in interpreting Section 86(2) of the Code. Court must

use the yardstick of a subjective test rather than having resorted to an objective

test in determining what is reasonable.

7

It was further submitted that the respondent had neither filed objections to the application made

by the appellant under the said section 86(2) nor given any evidence denying that she had given

the said letter to the appellant.

The learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention of this court to section 115 of the Evidence

Ordinance and submitted that the appellant is entitled to rely on the letter V1 in terms of the

said section. Further, the respondent is estopped in law from denying the representation made

to the appellant by the said letter. Thus, the appellant had urged reasonable grounds at the

inquiry to set aside the ex parte judgment and the decree.

Moreover, it was submitted that the District Court had awarded damages as prayed for by the

respondent although the loss suffered was not established by evidence and that, therefore, the

judgment entered for payment of the said damages is contrary to law.

In support of the above submission, the learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention of this

court to the cases of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike v Times of Ceylon Limited [1995] 1 SLR

22 and Cisilin Nona v Gunasena Jayawardana, SC Appeal No. 190/2012 SC Minutes 05th

May, 2016.

In the circumstances, it was submitted that the aforesaid District Court order refusing to set

aside the ex parte judgment and the decree, and the High Court judgment should be set aside.

Submissions of the respondent

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that during cross-examination, the appellant

had admitted that he had three (03) original copies of the said letter produced, marked as V1.

Further, it was submitted that the appellant had admitted that he had neither given the copies

of the said letter to his instructing attorney nor informed his attorney that the said action

instituted against him would be withdrawn by the instructing attorney of the respondent in

compliance with the said letter V1.

Thus, the counsel for the respondent contended that the appellant had not believed that the said

action would be withdrawn in accordance with the said letter and that, therefore, the appellant

had failed to establish that he had reasonable grounds for his default.

Further, the respondent submitted that, in any event, the said letter was dated the 20th of

February, 2006. However, the appellants instructing attorney had appeared in court on the 1st

8

of March, 2006, the date fixed for filing the answer for the second time, and had moved for a

further date to file the answer without referring to the said letter V1.

Therefore, the counsel for the respondent submitted that neither party to the said action had

acted on the said letter marked as V1 and, hence, the appellant had no reasonable grounds

for failing to file the answer on the 17th of May, 2006.

Moreover, it was submitted that the appellant had obtained the said letter from the respondent

by using force on her and that she had written the said letter under duress and had lodged a

Police complaint stating the same. As such, no court should act on a document that has been

obtained by using force and/or undue influence.

The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the appellant has no right to

canvass the quantum of damages awarded in the ex parte judgment in a purge default inquiry.

Further, it was submitted that as section 88(1) of the said Code states that No appeal shall lie

against any judgment entered upon default, the merits of the default judgment cannot be

considered in an appeal filed against an order either refusing or allowing to vacate an ex parte

judgment and the decree.

In the circumstances, it was submitted that the appeal should be dismissed.

Has the appellant satisfied the court that he had reasonable grounds for his default?

In the instant appeal, one of the questions of law that needs to be considered is whether the

appellant had satisfied the learned District Judge that he had reasonable grounds for his default

in terms of section 86(2) of the said Code.

In order to consider the above, it is necessary to consider the relevant provisions in the said

Code.

Section 73 of the said Code states:

If the defendant does not admit the plaintiffs claim, he shall himself, or his

registered attorney shall on his behalf, deliver to the court a duly stamped

written answer.

Therefore, it is incumbent on the appellant to file his answer if he is denying the claim of the

Plaintiff.

9

Further, section 84 of the said Code states:

If the defendant fails to file his answer on or before the day fixed for the filing

of the answer, or on or before the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the

answer or having filed his answer, if he fails to appear on the day fixed for the

hearing of the action, and if the court is satisfied that the defendant has been

duly served with summons, or has received due notice of the day fixed for the

subsequent filing of the answer, or of the day fixed for the hearing of the action,

as the case may be, and if, on the occasion of such default of the defendant, the

plaintiff appears, then the court shall proceed to hear the case ex parte

forthwith, or on such other day as the court may fix. [Emphasis added]

Thus, section 84 of the said Code requires a defendant to file his answer on the day fixed by

the court for filing the same or the subsequent date fixed for filing the answer. Moreover, the

said section confers power on the court to fix the case for ex parte trial if the defendant fails to

file his answer on the date fixed or the subsequent date fixed for answer, if the court is satisfied

that the defendant has been duly served with summons, or has received due notice of the day

fixed for the subsequent filing of the answer.

In the instant appeal, it is common ground that on the 14th of December, 2005 which was the

summons returnable date, the appellants instructing attorney had filed the proxy on behalf of

the appellant and moved for a date to file the answer. Accordingly, the court had fixed the 1st

of March, 2006 as the second date to file the answer.

However, on the 1st of March, 2006 the instructing attorney for the appellant had once again

moved for further time to file the answer. Consequently, the court had given a further date to

file the answer and fixed the 17th of May, 2006 as the third date to file the answer.

As stated above, on the 17th of May 2006, the appellant had been absent in court and the

instructing attorney for the appellant had informed the court that the appellant had not given

instructions to proceed with the case, although he had sought instructions from the appellant.

If a client fails to give instructions to proceed with a case, a registered attorney is entitled to

inform court that he does not appear for the defendant on that occasion, even though he has

filed the proxy for the party. Otherwise, his appearance in court will ipso facto be an appearance

for his client. When such a matter is brought to the notice of court, it should be recorded

forthwith as a journal entry in the case record by the learned District Judge and the case should

10

be fixed for ex parte trial unless the defendant is present in court and moves for a date to defend

the action.

It is pertinent to observe that such a practice would prevent disputes arising thereafter in respect

of whether there was or was not an appearance for the relevant party. It further prevents the

subsequent raising of allegations against the instructing attorney.

Any such statement by the registered attorney is admissible in the inquiry held under section

86(2) of the said Code. In the current context, the appellant not only did not dispute the said

statement of the registered attorney but also admitted that he did not give the necessary

instructions to his registered attorney.

In the instant case, the appellants answer had not been filed in court even on the third date

fixed for filing the same. Accordingly, the court had acted in terms and under section 84 of the

said Code and fixed the case for ex parte trial.

Section 86(2) of the said Code sets out the recourse available to the defendant who has had an

ex parte decree entered against him:

Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered against him

for default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes application to and

thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable grounds for such default, the

court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to

proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to

costs or otherwise as to the court shall appear proper. [Emphasis added]

In the case of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayike v Times of Ceylon [1995] 1 SLR 22, it was held;

Insofar as a remedy in the District Court is concerned, the general rule would

apply that the judge is functus officio, and cannot review its own judgment.

However, section 86 makes an exception, by conferring jurisdiction on the

District Court to set aside a default judgment if it was flawed in procedural

respects but not on the merits. The necessary implication of the grant of that

jurisdiction is that the District Court is not competent to review a default

judgment on the merits. That is, beyond question, the long-established practice

of the District Court.

11

The abovementioned provision confers jurisdiction on the District Court to set aside an ex parte

judgment and a decree.

In the case of The Ceylon Brewery Ltd. v Jax Fernando, Proprietor, Maradana Wine Stores,

[2001] 1 SLR 270, it was held that the jurisdiction of the court in respect of a section 86(2)

inquiry is subject to two conditions being satisfied. Firstly, the application should be made by

the defendant within fourteen days of the service of the decree on the defendant. Secondly, the

defendant must satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds for the said default.

Accordingly, the learned judge must reach a finding on whether the defendant had reasonable

grounds for his default based on the evidence led at the inquiry held under section 86(2) of the

said Code. Once the said conditions are satisfied, it is imperative that the court vacate the ex

parte judgment.

Further, in terms of section 86(2), it is evident that the burden of proof lies on the party in

default to satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds for such default. In Rani

Lokugalappaththi v H. H. D. De Silva, SC/Appeal No/117/2013 SC Minutes 02nd October,

2015, it was held that:

It must be noted that the burden of proof cast upon an Applicant who makes

an application under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code is not similar

to a proof of balance of probability. It is much less than that. What is required

under Section 86(2) is that to adduce reasonable grounds for default to the

satisfaction of Court.

The sole explanation of the appellant during the inquiry held under section 86(2) of the said

Code was that the defendant did not file his answer on the 17th of May, 2006 because he

believed that the said action instituted against him would be withdrawn by the respondents

instructing attorney in compliance with the instructions given in the said letter V1. Therefore,

the appellant had stated that he had reasonable grounds for his default in terms of section 86(2)

of the said Code.

During the said inquiry, the appellant had produced an original of the said letter dated 20th of

February 2006, marked as V1, by which the respondent had instructed her registered attorney

to withdraw the said action instituted against the appellant.

Further, during cross-examination at the said inquiry the appellant had admitted that he had

known that the court had fixed the 01st of March, 2006 as the second date to file the answer.

12

Moreover, the appellant admitted that the respondent had given him three (03) original copies

of the said letter before the 01st March, 2006. Further, he admitted that he had failed to inform

his instructing attorney of the receipt of the said letter or the contents thereof.

In particular, the appellant admitted at the said inquiry that his instructing attorney had by

registered letter, informed him that the court had fixed the 17th of May, 2006 as the third date

to file the answer and had requested the appellants instructions before the said date to proceed

with the case. He has further admitted that, after receiving the said letter, he had neither

contacted his instructing attorney nor given instructions that were required to proceed with the

said action.

Furthermore, the appellant admitted that, after receiving the said letter, he had not taken any

steps to verify whether the said action instituted against him had been withdrawn on the 1st of

March, 2006.

It is evident from the above facts that the appellant had received the said letter dated the 20th

of February, 2006 marked as V1 before the 01st of March, 2006, which was the second date

fixed by the court for filing the answer. Therefore, had the appellant believed that the said

action would be withdrawn as per the said letter, he would have informed his instructing

attorney before the 01st of March, 2006 that the said action would be withdrawn.

However, the appellant had admitted that he did not inform his instructing attorney about the

said letter. As a result, his instructing attorney had appeared in court on the 01st of March, 2006

and moved for a further date to file the answer.

It is also significant to note that, after the 1st of March, 2006, the appellants instructing attorney

had informed the appellant by registered letter that he was required to file the answer on the

17th of May, 2006. Therefore, the appellant had become aware that the said action had not been

withdrawn as per the said letter of the respondent produced marked as V1.

Further, the appellant had admitted that he neither inquired from his instructing attorney nor

the Court Registrar whether the said action had been withdrawn by the respondent. From the

date of receiving the letter marked as V1 on the 01st of March, 2006 until the 17th of May,

2006, the appellant had not taken any steps to verify whether the action instituted against him

had been withdrawn.

It is useful to consider if the defendant was entitled to rely on the letter marked as V1 alleged

to have been written by the plaintiff as a reasonable ground for not filing the answer on the 17th

13

of May, 2006 which was the third date fixed for the answer. It was submitted by the appellant

that the said letter amounted to an agreement between the parties not to file an answer.

In an action filed under regular procedure, the defendant shall file his answer on the day fixed

for answer, or obtain further time to file his answer, either personally, through a registered

attorney, or by his recognized agent referred to in section 24 of the said Code, if he does not

admit the plaintiffs claim. The wording of section 73 and section 84 when read together

contemplate that a court can grant more than one extension of time. Accordingly, if further

time is granted to file the answer, the defendant shall file the answer on the subsequent day

fixed for filing of the answer. Granting of an extension of time is within the discretion of the

court and such discretion shall be exercised judicially.

The Civil Procedure Code as amended stipulates the procedure applicable to regular actions

and summary actions. It stipulates the procedure that should be followed by the court as well

as the parties. The procedural law facilitates the administration of justice and to adjudicate

cases by applying substantive law. Although some requirements in procedural law are

directory, the others are mandatory. If a specific step in a procedural law is mandatory it cannot

be circumvented by the consent of parties. The word shall used in section 73 of the said Code

makes it mandatory for the defendant to file an answer if he does not admit the plaintiffs claim.

Accordingly, the mandatory requirement imposed by section 73 of the said Code on the

appellant to file his answer on the date fixed by the court could not have been circumvented by

an agreement of the parties, as fixing a date for an answer is a judicial act.

Further, parties by agreement cannot circumvent the procedure stipulated by a statute unless

the statute provides for such an agreement. Furthermore, such practices or arrangements would

adversely affect the administration of justice.

Moreover, such agreements would be against public policy. In any event, parties cannot

interfere with a judicial act that is required to be performed under the law.

Such agreements or arrangements are quite different from agreements to settle cases by the

parties. Even in an arrangement to settle a case in court, the court has a duty and a right to

consider whether such an arrangement is according to law and is in the interests of all the

parties concerned, as entering into such settlement in court would become a judicial act.

14

Although courts should encourage settlement of disputes, common law prohibits a court from

entering a consent decree under the guise of a judicial act if it violates the law or public policy.

In the circumstances, the duty to file an answer subsequent to an order made by a court cannot

be circumvented by consent of the parties as it amounts to a violation of the said provisions of

the said Code and the judicial order granting a date to file the answer.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant drew the attention of court to section 115 of

the Evidence Ordinance and submitted that the learned District Judge should have allowed the

application for vacation of the ex parte judgment as the appellant relied on the letter marked

V1 and acted according to the contents of the said letter.

Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When one person has by his declaration, act, or omission intentionally caused

or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such

belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed in any suit or

proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to deny the

truth of that thing.

In light of the above, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant stated that the respondent

is estopped in law from denying the representation made to the appellant by the said letter.

However, as the aforementioned facts show that the appellant has not acted on the letter marked

and produced as V1, section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance has no application to the instant

appeal.

Moreover, the said section has no application for acts performed contrary to public policy. In

the present context, as stated above, the said letter was an attempt to circumvent the course of

the administration of justice. When an agreement or undertaking is tainted with illegality, such

agreement or undertaking cannot be enforced through courts.

A similar view was expressed in the case of Jayasuria v Kotalawala 23 NLR 511, wherein the

defendant was in prison when he was sued on a bond. Being deceived by the plaintiff, he made

no effort to appear in the action and judgment was entered for the plaintiff. He moved to re-

open judgment. The reason given by him as to why the defendant did not appear in the action

was not that he was prevented by misfortune from appearing to show cause, and as such, it was

held that his proper remedy was to apply for restitutio in integrum or seek damages for fraud.

15

In the current circumstances, the facts establish that the appellants default was effectuated by

his own inaction and lack of due diligence in respect of his duty to file the answer on the date

fixed by court.

Further, a defendant is entitled under section 86(2) to adduce evidence to prove that he was

prevented from appearing in court by reason of accident or misfortune or not having received

due information of the proceedings about the case. However, in the instant appeal, the appellant

had failed to discharge the burden of satisfying the court that he had reasonable grounds for his

default in terms of section 86(2) of the said Code.

The above conduct of the appellant demonstrates that he was negligent in instructing his

instructing attorney to file his answer on the 17th of May, 2006.

Can the legality of the quantum of damages awarded in the ex parte decree be contested

in proceedings for the vacation of the said ex parte decree?

Learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant submitted that the District Court had awarded

damages as prayed for by the respondent although the loss suffered was not established by

evidence and that, therefore, the judgment entered for payment of the said damages is contrary

to law. In support of the above submission, the learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention

of the court to the cases of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike v Times of Ceylon Limited (supra)

and Cisilin Nona v Gunasena Jayawardana (supra).

In the circumstances, it was submitted that the aforesaid District Court order and High Court

judgment should be set aside.

In response to this submission, the learned counsel for the respondent raised the following

question of law at the time special leave was granted:

As this is not a revision application, can the quantum of damages awarded in the

ex parte decree be contested in these proceedings for purging default?

A plain reading of section 86(2) shows that the scope of an inquiry under section 86(2) of the

said Code is only limited to satisfy court that the defendant had reasonable grounds for such

default. Further, if the defendant satisfies court that the defendant had reasonable grounds for

such default, the word shall used in the said section makes it mandatory for the court to set

16

aside the ex parte judgment and decree entered against the defendant and permit him to proceed

with the case.

In this context, it is necessary to consider whether the District Court has the jurisdiction to

consider the legality of the ex parte judgment and the decree entered against the defendant at

an inquiry to vacate an ex parte order and set it aside if the judgment is contrary to law. In other

words, whether a defendant is entitled to invite the District Court to reconsider the ex parte

judgment under the pretext of vacation of an ex parte judgment. If the answer to the above is

in the affirmative, even if the defendant failed to satisfy court that he had reasonable grounds

for his default, he should be entitled to get the ex parte judgment set aside on the basis that the

said judgment is contrary to law.

In this regard, it is useful to consider the judicial power of a District Court to re-consider a

judgment delivered by the same court. Once a judgment is delivered by a court, it becomes

functus as far as the legality of the judgment is concerned, and it cannot re-open the case.

However, section 189 of the said Code has conferred jurisdiction on the court to correct any

clerical or arithmetical mistakes in any judgment or order or any error arising therein from any

accidental slip or omission, or to make any amendment which is necessary to bring a decree

into conformity with the judgment.

This view was expressed in Muttu Raman v Mohammadu 21 NLR 97, at page 98, where it

was held; A Court has no jurisdiction to alter or amend its decree, except in conformity with

the provisions of section 189 of the Code, in order to bring the decree into harmony with the

judgment or to rectify a clerical or arithmetical error.

Further, in Deonis v. Samarasinghe et al 15 NLR 39 at 41, Charles Bright & Co., Ltd v.

Sellar (1904) 1 K.B. 6 was cited with approval, wherein it was held that a court cannot correct

a mistake of its own after the judgment has been perfected, even though the error is apparent

on the face of the judgment.

The exception to this rule is set out in section 86 of the said Code, which allows for an ex parte

judgment and the decree entered against the defendant to be set aside if the defendant satisfies

the court that he had reasonable ground for default. However, in such instances, the court has

no power whatsoever to consider the legality of the ex parte judgment.

Thus, a court that delivers an order or a judgment cannot sit in appeal to review its own order

or judgment.

17

Further, section 88 of the said Code states:

(1) No appeal shall lie against any judgment entered upon default.

(2) The order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon default

shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon the facts and specifying the

grounds upon which it is made, and shall be liable to an appeal to the Court of

Appeal.

In the circumstances, the scope of the inquiry under section 86(2) of the said Code should be

considered in the light of section 88 of the said Code.

It is clear that when the legislator has specifically excluded the right to appeal against a

judgment entered upon default, the question of whether the same court could review its own

judgment cannot arise. In this regard, the doctrine of quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo

which states that when anything is prohibited directly, it is not possible to do it indirectly, is

applicable. Thus, when section 88(2) of the said Code acts as an ouster clause for appeals in

respect of default judgments, it is not possible in law to use an inquiry for ex parte vacation as

a means of appeal against an ex parte judgment.

Thus, in an inquiry under section 86(2) of the said Code, the court is not conferred with the

power to consider the legality of an ex parte judgment delivered by the said court. However, if

a court comes to a finding that there were reasonable grounds for default by the defendant, it

is incumbent on the court to set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to

proceed with his defence.

However, though it is not possible to canvass the legality of the ex parte judgment in an inquiry

held under and in terms of section 86(2) of the said Code, a defendant who is served with an

ex parte judgment is not without a legal remedy. He can canvass the merits and legality of such

a judgment either by invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of an appropriate court or by way of

an application for restitutio in integrum under Article 138 of the Constitution.

In the case of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayike v Times of Ceylon (supra), it was held:

No specific remedy has been provided to correct errors in respect of the

substance of an ex parte default judgment. Section 88(1) confers no remedy, but

merely excludes an appeal; from that exclusion it is not permissible to infer an

exclusion of revision as well. On the contrary, the express exclusion of an appeal

18

justifies the inference that it was intended to permit other remedies, such as

revision.

I am therefore of the view that a default judgment can be canvassed on the merits

of the Court of Appeal, in revision, though not in appeal, and not in the District

Court itself.

Further, it is important to note that sections 86 and 88 were amended by section 23 of Law No.

20 of 1977 and, therefore, the judgments that were decided on the repealed sections 86 and 88

of the said Code have no application in interpreting the present sections 86 and 88 of the said

Code.

Thus, a defendant who was served with an ex parte decree cannot invoke section 86(2) of the

said Code to revisit an ex parte judgment and if he is unsuccessful in his attempt to set aside

the ex parte judgment in such proceedings, to file an appeal under section 88(2) of the said

Code to canvass the order refraining to vacate the ex parte judgment.

In the circumstances, I affirm the judgment of the High Court, which upheld the order of the

District Court.

The appeal is dismissed. I order no costs.
