Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff company filed this action against the defendant company in

the Commercial High Court seeking recovery of a sum of Rs.

20,383,451.56 with interest on the basis that the thread supplied by the

defendant on 20.05.1994 and 04.06.1994 (vide paragraph 5(a) of the

plaint) were not in good order and condition. According to paragraph 5(c)

of the plaint, the plaintiff had paid a sum of Rs. 62,087.85 to the

defendant for this purchase. The defendant filed answer seeking

dismissal of the plaintiff’s action and made a claim in reconvention in a

sum of Rs. 2.5 million for loss of reputation. After trial, the learned Judge

of the Commercial High Court entered judgment for the plaintiff. Hence

this appeal by the defendant.

The plaintiff is a manufacturer of shoes. The case for the plaintiff is that

it incurred damages as a result of a foreign buyer rejecting a consignment

of shoes manufactured by the plaintiff due to the soles of the shoes

becoming discoloured by the dispersing of the dye in the thread supplied

by the defendant.

The invoices relevant to the thread supplied by the defendant on

20.05.1994 (V3) and 04.06.1994 (V4) and the written conditions of sale

(V5) were marked through the evidence of the main witness for the

plaintiff, Mr. Amunugama, the General Manager (Operations) of the

plaintiff company (vide page 72 of the brief). On the same page he clearly

admits in evidence that when the plaintiff makes a purchase, the

4

SC/CHC/19/2002

purchased item is specified in an invoice, and that invoice denotes the

conditions of sale.

Q. When you make a purchase what you purchase is specified on

an invoice and that invoice denotes the conditions of sale?

A. Yes.

(4th condition read)

…..

(The invoice dated the 4th of June 1994 is marked V3; invoice dated

20th May 1994 is marked V4 and conditions of sale as V5.)

In my view, V3, V4 and V5 constitute the agreement of sale of the

disputed lot of thread.

On the front page of V3 and V4 it is printed “TERMS AND CONDITIONS

OF SALE ON REVERSE” and the “CONDITIONS OF SALE” on the reverse

of V3 and V4 is marked V5.

The 4th condition reads as follows:

Because of the disproportionate value of sewing thread in relation to

the value of other items used in the manufacture of wearing apparel,

the purchaser must satisfy himself that any thread ordered is

suitable in every respect for the end use intended. All express or

implied warranties or conditions statutory or otherwise as to quality

or fitness for any purpose are hereby expressly excluded.

The 9th condition reads as follows:

Where due to operation of law, consequential, special or incidental

damages cannot be excluded, they are expressly limited in amount

to the purchase price of the merchandise purchased.

In view of my final decision, the 9th condition has no relevance.

5

SC/CHC/19/2002

The plaintiff accepted the thread relevant to this case subject to the 4th

condition. The learned High Court Judge accepts this in the judgment

but states “In my view the defendant could not rely on the exemption

clause in V5 because in P7 the defendant has created an impression in the

mind of the plaintiff that the thread supplied by the defendant is resistant

to chemical attack.” The learned Judge further explains “In the

circumstances the express condition in P7 that the polyester thread is

resistant to chemical attack overrides the exemption clause found in

condition 4 of the document marked V5.”

P7 stipulates the following condition.

Astra is a spun polyester thread specifically designed for very high

speed sewing. It has many properties superior to other sewing

threads. It is stronger, size for size, than threads currently on the

market. Interchangeable with other threads with little machine

adjustment. Under 1% shrinkage. Resistant to perspiration and

chemical attack. Suited to tropical conditions. Very low hot air

shrinkage.

The learned High Court Judge says the above is an express condition. On

the face of P7, it is so; but the question is whether it is an express

condition of the contract entered into between the plaintiff and the

defendant. It is not the position of the learned High Court Judge that it

is an implied condition of the contract; nor was such a clear position

taken by the plaintiff at the argument. If the said condition is to be treated

as an implied condition of the contract as opposed to an express

condition, different principles of law (statutory and case law) are

applicable and I find no such discussion in the post-argument written

submissions either.

6

SC/CHC/19/2002

An exemption clause is a term in a contract which excludes or limits or

purports to exclude or limit, a liability which would otherwise arise.

Traditionally, Courts are loath to give a liberal interpretation to such

clauses and instead give a literal interpretation. Court should be mindful

of sweeping exclusion clauses imposed on weaker parties when assessing

the extent of contractual obligations. An ambiguous term in an exemption

clause can be restrictively interpreted against the person seeking to rely

on it by application of the contra proferentem rule. But if the exemption

clause is clearly worded and the contract is a commercial contract as

opposed to a consumer contract, Court is prepared to deviate from this

traditional view. In Photo Production Ltd v. Securicor Transport Ltd [1980]

AC 826, Lord Diplock stated at 851:

in commercial contracts negotiated between businessmen capable of

looking after their own interests and of deciding how risks…can be

most economically borne…it is wrong to place a strained

construction upon words in an exclusion clause which are clear and

fairly susceptible of one meaning.

It is not possible for an exemption clause and an express condition term

to co-exist in a contract; one has to supersede the other. J.C. Smith in

The Law of Contract (London: Sweet and Maxwell 1989) at page 148 states

“A man cannot in one and same contract expressly include a term (whether

condition or warranty) and also exclude it.”

What is P7 (which is said to contain an “express condition” relevant to

the contract) and how did it find its way into the case record?

There is no dispute that the plaintiff uses a chemical known as toluene

in the shoe manufacturing process (toluene is a component in the paste

used by the plaintiff to affix the sole of the shoe to the upper part) and

the dispersing of the dye from the thread occurred because of the use of

7

SC/CHC/19/2002

toluene since the dye is soluble in toluene. Vide the evidence of the

plaintiff’s own expert witness, the Director of the Rubber Research

Institute. In my view, the finding of the expert witness does not favour

the plaintiff although the plaintiff thinks otherwise.

When witness Amunugama was cross-examined on whether the plaintiff

company informed the defendant company of their requirement for the

thread, his answer was “On the catalogue they say that the thread is

suitable for this process and I have seen that.” Then when he was asked

whether he produces that catalogue, P7 was produced (page 65). If P7 is

an express condition of the contract between the plaintiff and the

defendant, is that how it should have found its way into the case record?

What happens if that question was not asked by counsel for the

defendant? In my view, if P7 was an express condition of the contract,

that document ought to have been listed and produced in the

examination of chief. It is in this backdrop that we need to assess whether

P7 is an express condition.

It is the position of the defendant that the defendant manufactures

thread for the apparel (clothes) industry and not for the shoe

manufacturing industry, and the P7 catalogue should be understood in

that context. By looking at the language in P7, I cannot reject that

argument. The use of the word “shrinkage” in two places of that

document supports the defendant’s position. It refers to clothes shrinking

in the laundry.

Witness Amunugama admits that the defendant manufactures this

thread for clothing or apparel purposes (page 62) and that the defendant

in P7 does not state that this thread can be used for the manufacture of

shoes (page 65). However he says they had purchased thread from the

defendant from at least 1990 and the defendant knew of the purpose of

the purchase.

8

SC/CHC/19/2002

As I stated at the outset, the questionable purchase took place on

20.05.1994 and 04.06.1994; but this witness admits there was a similar

complaint (the dispersing of dye from the thread to the sole of the shoe)

in 1992. The written complaint made in that regard dated 08.10.1992

marked V1 reads:

We regret to advise that the black thread supplied by you were used

in some shoes exported to Italy, but, unfortunately these threads

have been bleeding over a period of time and they have been coming

through the rubber foxing, outsole, etc. Therefore, the customer has

rejected the entire consignment and they are claiming refund of the

value of US$ 31,411.20. We attach herewith a copy of the fax

received from our Agents in Italy in this regard. Further these shoes

were shown by our Supplies Manager to your Mr. Amarasekera,

Marketing Director and Mr. B. Perera your Sales Manager. If you

require further samples we could dispatch same to you.

We would appreciate if you kindly let us know the manner in which

you would wish to resolve this claim. Your earliest reply would be

appreciated.

Condition No. 4 of the contract (V3/V4) clearly states “the purchaser must

satisfy himself that any thread ordered is suitable in every respect for the

end use intended.” This in my view is a fair and reasonable condition. The

reason as stated by the defendant to the plaintiff in V2 is “We have no

control over the processes, or changes of processes, which our customers

may employ in the manufacture of their products and cannot therefore take

any responsibility for them.” I agree with this explanation. V2 was sent

long before the institution of the action. This is not a position the

defendant took up for the first time at the argument – vide also paragraph

8(b) and (e) of the answer.

9

SC/CHC/19/2002

It is the position of the defendant that the plaintiff accepted this

explanation and their business relationship continued. Witness

Amunugama accepts that no action was instituted on the written

complaint V1 to recover damages etc. It is significant to note that the

witness admits that after this complaint on 08.10.1992 the plaintiff

company continued to purchase thread from the Defendant (page 69)

and, what is more, even after the incident relevant to the instant action

in 1994, they continued to do so (page 72). This amounts to acquiescence

or waiver on the part of the plaintiff; the plaintiff waived his right to

complain against the violation of the contract, if at all there was such a

condition. In the case of Hartley v. Hymans [1920] 3 KB 475 the buyer

expressed his frustration through letters regarding the late delivery of the

product and requested better deliveries. The seller continued to make the

deliveries after the agreed completion date. The buyer later cancelled the

order and refused to take up further deliveries. Court held that the buyer

had waived his right to claim that the period for delivery had ended on

the date agreed by continuing to write letters.

In view of the above, the contention of the plaintiff that there was no way

the plaintiff could have known that the dye used by the defendant would

disperse and cause the discoloration of the shoes is unsustainable. The

plaintiff knew of the problem beforehand. The written complaint made by

the plaintiff to the defendant regarding the instant issue dated

30.12.1994 marked P18 is identical to the complaint in V2 made in 1992.

The evidence of the defendant’s witness, who was the Director

(Manufacturing) in the defendant company, was that the defendant was

under no obligation to supply thread to the plaintiff for the manufacture

of shoes and “it was for the defendant company to consider whether the

thread was suitable for their purpose and this was meant for the apparel

industry.” (page 162) His position is that “According to the apparel

10

SC/CHC/19/2002

standard it [the dye] does not migrate.” (page 174) This is because in

domestic washing, laundering, dry-cleaning etc. chemicals like toluene

are not used. This was further explained in the re-examination:

Q: You also state that this thread that is sold by your company is

manufactured for what purpose?

A: Cloth stitching.

Q: Your attention was drawn to the document P7, produced by the

plaintiff on the last date?

A: Yes.

Q: Which states ‘resistant to perspiration and chemical attack’?

A: Yes.

Q: By that term what are the chemicals contemplated?

A: Chemicals contact with the clothes used in domestic ... Industrial

washing and dry-cleaning.

Q: What does it mean industrial washing?

A: Laundering.

Q: Soap and other matters containing chemicals?

A: Yes.

Q: It is resistant to that chemical that are referred to in P7?

A: Yes.

Q: You also draw the attention of Court to the document P5 which

contains conditions of sale referred to by the defendant-company,

sale of this thread?

A: Yes.

Q: You draw the attention of Court to condition No.4, that the

purchaser must satisfy that the thread is suitable in every respect

for the end use intended?

A: Yes.

11

SC/CHC/19/2002

Q: You find that on the evidence, that though this thread is meant

for cloth stitching purposes that there are various buyers who buy

the thread for other purposes?

A: Yes.

Q: Now for manufacture of shoes?

A: Yes.

Q: According to condition No.4, the purchaser must satisfy that the

thread is suitable for what is said, for his use?

A: Yes.

Although this witness stated that the thread is used for cloth stitching,

it was suggested to the witness that the thread is sold for shoe

manufacturing also to companies such as Bata, DSI, DI and ASIA. This

was admitted by the witness; but the important point is there are no

complaints from other shoe manufacturers of the dye dispersing from the

thread and damaging the shoes (page 209). This also goes to show that

the problem (dye dispersing) does not lie in the thread supplied per se,

but the way the manufacturing process of the end product takes place,

over which the defendant says it has no control, and rightly so.

The learned High Court Judge has relied upon two decisions to arrive at

his decision, i.e. that P7 overrides V3. One is Andrews Brothers

(Bournemouth) Ltd v. Singer & Co Ltd [1934] 1 KB 17 and the other is

Curtis v. Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co [1951] 1 KB 805.

In Andrews Brothers (Bournemouth) Ltd v. Singer & Co Ltd, a contract “for

the sale of new Singer cars” contained a clause (5) by which “all

conditions, warranties and liabilities implied by statute, common law, or

otherwise are excluded”. The sellers delivered, and the buyers accepted,

a car which was not a new car. In an action for damages for breach of

contract in that the car delivered was not a new car, the sellers contended

that the condition that the car should correspond with the description “a

12

SC/CHC/19/2002

new Singer car,” which would otherwise be implied by section 13 of the

Sale of Goods Act, 1893, was excluded by clause 5 and the buyer’s claim

was, therefore, barred. It was held that “the buyers were entitled to

damages because the contract was a contract for the sale of “new Singer

cars”; the term “new Singer cars” was an express, and not an implied, term

of the contract and, therefore, it was not excluded by clause 5.” The facts

of Andrews’ case are different from the one before me. If I may repeat, in

that case the contract was “for the sale of new Singer cars” and therefore

it was an express term of the contract itself, and clause 5 which was an

exclusion clause was held to apply only to new vehicles, and therefore

did not apply to exclude the condition implied by section 13 of the Sale of

Goods Act, 1893. There is no such express term in the contract (V3-V5)

the parties have agreed to in the instant case, nor does the learned High

Court Judge say that the condition – that the thread sold is resistant to

chemicals – is an implied term of the contract.

In Curtis v. Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co, the plaintiff took a white

satin dress to the defendants’ shop to be cleaned. She was given a paper

headed “Receipt” and was asked by a shop assistant to sign it. The

plaintiff inquired why her signature was required and the assistant

replied, in effect, that the defendants would not accept liability for certain

specific risks, including the risk of damage by or to the beads and sequins

with which the dress was trimmed. In fact the “receipt” contained a

condition that the cleaners accepted no liability for any damage however

arising. When the dress was returned to the plaintiff it was found to be

stained, and she was awarded damages by the County Court Judge who

held that the defendants had been guilty of negligence and were not

protected by their exemption clause by reason of misrepresentation as to

its character. The Court held that the defendants could not rely on the

exemption clause because their assistant, by an innocent

misrepresentation, had created a false impression in the mind of the

13

SC/CHC/19/2002

plaintiff as to the extent of the exemption and thereby induced her to sign

the receipt. Here again the facts are different. In the instant case there is

no false misrepresentation. When the plaintiff complained about the

same issue in 1992 (vide V2), according to the defendant, the defendant

explained its position and the plaintiff accepted it; for otherwise they

would not have continued with the business relationship. According to

the evidence of witness Amunugama, the plaintiff has handled the

situation by purchasing light colour thread instead of dark colour thread

(page 72). In Curtis v. Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co, the contract was

between a customer and the company whereas here the contract is

between two companies, which take calculated business decisions. And,

unlike in Curtis, here the decisions were not required to be taken

instantly.

The learned High Court Judge is not correct when he states “the

defendant could not rely on the exemption clause in V5 because in P7 the

defendant has created an impression in the mind of the plaintiff that the

thread supplied by the defendant is resistant to chemical attack” and “the

express condition in P7 that the polyester thread is resistant to chemical

attack overrides the exemption clause found in condition 4 of the document

marked V5.” In the facts and circumstances of this case, I take the view

that P7 is not part of the agreement; there is no correlation between P7

and V5. Therefore, the question whether one clause overrides the other

does not arise and the exemption clause stands.

In view of this finding, there is no necessity for me look into the question

of the damages awarded by the learned High Court Judge to the plaintiff.

It does not arise.

I set aside the judgment of the Commercial High Court and allow the

appeal of the defendant. The plaintiff’s action shall stand dismissed. I

make no order as to costs.
