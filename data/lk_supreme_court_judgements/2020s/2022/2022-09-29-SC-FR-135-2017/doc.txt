Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Petitioner made an application in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution for the alleged violation

of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the Constitution as a

consequence of an illegal arrest of her by several officers attached to Ambalangoda Police Station

including the 2nd Respondent. This court, having considered material placed before it, granted leave

to proceed for the alleged violations under Articles 12 (1) and 13 (1) on 07.07.2017. Some of the

Respondents namely, the 1st to 3rd Respondents who were originally represented by the Hon.

Attorney General, had later retained Private Counsel and were represented by the said counsel

during the arguments before us.

As revealed before us, the Petitioner was a 58 years old widowed woman with 05 grown up children

at the time she filed the instant application. In her Petition filed before this Court, the Petitioner

admits having a past record of several convictions for possession and sale of illicit liquor and drugs

but had taken up the position that she had a reformed life in the recent past.

It was her position that she left her residence in Welikanda Ahungalla where she stayed with her

daughter, somewhere in May 2016 and had visited her eldest daughter namely, Induwadura Anusha

de Sliva who lived in Mabulgoda Pannipitiya and stayed with her for some time.

When she was with her eldest daughter, she learnt that somewhere around 24th June 2016, the 2nd

Respondent and five other police officers attached to Ambalangoda Police Station had broken into

the house of the Petitioner’s daughter at Welikanda- Ahungalla in the absence of her daughter at

home. However, her sister Liyanagamage Ashoka Shanthi and her daughter in law Peyahadi Devika

de Silva who occupied the house adjacent to the house of the Petitioner’s daughter had witnessed

the incident.

Since the Petitioner was not in the village and was living with her eldest daughter in Pannipitiya area,

she lodged a complaint at the Police Headquarters with regard to the incident that took place on 24th

June at her younger daughter’s place in Ahungalla. The Petitioner underwent a cataract surgery at

Hemas Hospital Wattala on 25.09.2016. On 24th, the Petitioner’s younger daughter who lived in

Ahungalla had received a police message through Ahungalla Police informing her mother, i.e., the

Petitioner before this court, to be present at the office of the Senior Superintendent of Police Elpitiya

on 26.09.2016 for an inquiry with regard to the written complaint the Petitioner had lodged with the

Inspector General of Police. The Petitioner, who returned to the village immediately after the eye

surgery, had visited the office of the Senior Superintendent at Elpitiya with her son on the 26th at

10.00 a.m.

4

As revealed before this court, the Petitioner and her son had waited several hours at the Senior

Superintendent’s office waiting for the Senior Superintendent, but since they were informed by the

other officers that the Senior Superintendent will not be available, they came out of the office

premises in order to go home. At that time the Petitioner was stopped outside the Senior

Superintendent’s Office by a team of police officers including the 2nd Respondent and was dragged

into a jeep that was parked nearby. According to the affidavit filed by the son of the Petitioner

namely, Induwadura Inosh de Silva, when his mother was dragged inside the Jeep, he had rushed to

the police office and informed them as to what happened to his mother, but the officers at the Senior

Superintendent’s office were silent and had refused to record a statement from him.

The Petitioner who was arrested on the 26th near the Police office at Elpitiya was produced before

the Magistrate of Balapitiya on the same day and remanded to the Fiscal Custody in a case that was

pending before the said court on a ‘B’ Report filed by Ambalangoda Police Station. The said report

referred, to a raid conducted by the officers attached to Ambalangoda Police Station on 23.06.2016

at the Petitioner’s residence, where the police had recovered 710 milligrams of heroin but could not

arrest the suspect since the Petitioner had fled the scene of crime leaving 6 Packets of suspected

brown powder. After producing the Petitioner before Magistrate’s Court, the 3rd Respondent

submitted evidence before Court by way of an affidavit and moved the Productions to be sent to the

Government Analyst. The Petitioner continued to be in remand custody until the receipt of the

Government Analyst’s Report. On 06.03.2017 PS 28850 who appeared for the prosecution had

informed court that the police will not proceed with the case since the Government Analyst had not

found any dangerous drugs in the brown powder and the learned Magistrate had accordingly

discharged the suspect on the same day.

5

Whilst submitting that the Respondents have fabricated a false case against her and subsequently

arrested her illegally when she came to appear before the Senior Superintendent Elpitiya to attend

an inquiry, the Petitioner had submitted that the said conduct of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents were

in violation of the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the

Constitution.

In response to the position taken up by the Petitioner, the 1st to the 3rd Respondents have submitted

that,

a) The Petitioner is a well-known drug dealer in the area and her antecedents reveal 07

convictions for drug related offences.

b) On credible information received through the Assistant Superintendent of Police of the area,

the 1st Respondent along with 2nd and 3rd Respondents conducted a raid and apprehended

one Asanka de Silva at Sri Gunananda Mawatha Mohottiwatta Balapitiya for possession of a

substance suspected as heroin.

c) Upon being questioned, the suspect revealed that he purchased the said quantity of ‘drugs’

from one ‘Anoma Shanthi’ alias ‘Kudu Nona’, who lived close by, and the police party visited

the house of the Petitioner.

d) Upon seeing the arrival of the Police party, the Petitioner who was standing near the gate of

her house had fled the area. At that time the Petitioner dropped six packets as the Petitioner

stripped off some of her garments. Since the police party did not consist of a female officer

to apprehend the Petitioner, they gave up the idea of chasing her but, the substance which

was dropped by her was subsequently taken into custody by the police party.

6

e) The facts pertaining to the said raid was reported to court under B/91496/2016 before the

Magistrate’s Court of Balapitiya on 24.06.2016 and time was obtained to produce the

suspect.

f) The Petitioner was subsequently arrested on 26.09.2016 while she was travelling in a three-

wheeler at Aruwala Bridge and produced before the Hon. Magistrate on the same day and

remanded for fiscal custody.

g) The Respondents were unaware of a complaint made by the Petitioner to the Police

Headquarters and/or with regard to an inquiry by the Senior Superintendent of Police Elpitiya

scheduled for the 26.09.2016.

h) On the strength of the Government Analyst’s Report, and the application made by the police,

Hon. Magistrate Balapitiya discharged the suspect from the proceedings.

Whilst submitting the above in the affidavit filed before this court, the Respondents have annexed a

copy of the relevant case record marked R-1. The said record contained the very first ‘B’ Report filed

before the Magistrate’s Court on 24.06.2016, immediately after the raid at the house of the

Petitioner and the subsequent proceedings before the Magistrate’s Court of Balapitiya.

In the ‘B’ Report, signed by the 1st Respondent, it was reported to court that, a police party led by

the 3rd Respondent along with three other officers including the 2nd Respondent, whilst on patrol

duty, had acted on information received by a private informant with regard to the sale of illegal drugs

and raided the house of one Liyanagamage Anoma Shanthi alias “

” at Sumangala

Mawatha Welikanda.

After seeing the police party, the suspect who was standing near the gate of her house had fled the

area dropping six packets which were in her custody at that time.

7

The six packets which contained 710 milligrams of suspected brown powder, were produced at the

Police Station on the same day.

When the Petitioner was arrested by the officers of Ambalangoda Police Station on 26.09.2016,

a further report was filed before the Magistrate’s Court on the same day and moved to remand her

to the fiscal custody under the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Whilst making an order to remand the Petitioner for fiscal custody, the learned Magistrate had made

the following observation in the journal entry.

“nkaOkd.dr .; lrñ' nkaOkd.drh uÕska wefia Y,Hl¾uhlg wod,j m%:sldr wjYHkï

,nd oSug wjOdkhg fhduq lrñ' ”

From the material that was placed before this Court by both parties, it is clear that the Petitioner

who had undergone an eye surgery on the 25.09.2016 at a private Hospital in Wattala, had appeared

at the Senior Superintendent’s Office at Elpitiya on the following day to attend an inquiry with regard

to a complaint she made at the Police Headquarters. The Inspector General of Police, the 4th

Respondent before this Court had failed to explain whether he called for any information from the

Senior Superintendent of Police Elpitiya as to why the Senior Superintendent of Police was not

present for the inquiry, when he summoned the complainant for an inquiry before him on the 26th

morning. According to the further report filed on the 26th after the arrest of the Petitioner, the 1st

Respondent had not explained as to how and on what information the police managed to arrest the

Petitioner after several months from the raid they carried out in Ahungalla.

According to their own reports filed before the Magistrate’s Court, the Petitioner had fled the area

when the police party raided her house and the police could not arrest her for nearly 03 months

since then. If the Petitioner was absconding during this period, that has to be specifically stated in

8

the report that was filed on the 26th September, but there is no such reference in the report filed

before the Magistrate’s Court.

According to the affidavit filed by Induwadura Inosh de Silva, the son of the Petitioner who was with

the Petitioner at the time of her arrest, he immediately rushed to the SSP’s Office and informed the

Officers at the Office of the illegal arrest of his elderly mother, but the officers at the SSP’s office,

neither took any interest to listen to him nor recorded his complaint at that time.

With regard to the raid said to have been conducted by the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents with several

other officers on the 23.06.2016, the 1st Respondent had filed a ‘B’ Report before the Magistrate’s

Court of Balapitiya on the following day, but the Respondents have taken two contradictory

positions, when the said report is compared with the affidavit filed by the 2nd Respondent before the

Supreme Court on behalf of all the Respondents.

As already referred to in this judgment, prior to the raid at the house of the Petitioner, the police

party led by the 3rd Respondent arrested one Asanka de Silva on credible information received

through the ASP, which led to the raid carried out at the house of the Petitioner. However, the ‘B’

Report does not refer to the credible information received through the ASP, which led to the arrest

of Asanka de Silva but it only refers to receiving credible information from a private informant whilst

the police party was on patrol duty. There is no reference to the arrest of one Asanka de Silva in the

‘B’ Report. When considering the above, it appears that the facts placed before the Magistrate’s

Court by the 1st Respondent on 24.06.2016 are incorrect.

With regard to the raid carried out at the house of the Petitioner, the Respondents have submitted

that they did not chase behind the Petitioner in the absence of a lady officer in the raiding party. If

the police decided to act on the information received by the private informant, they should have first

9

obtained the assistance of a lady officer, since the raid has to be carried out on a female suspect at

her residence.

The above position taken by the Respondents before this court is also contradictory with the

narration given by the Petitioner before this court. As submitted by the Petitioner, she decided to

lodge a complaint at the Police Headquarters when she heard of some police officers including 2nd

Respondent forcibly entering her daughter’s house whilst the residents were away. The Petitioner

who wanted an impartial investigation with regard to the said incident had decided to come back to

Balapitiya and visited the Senior Superintendent’s office at Elpitiya, even after undergoing an eye

surgery on the previous day.

This position was corroborated by two witnesses namely Liyanagamage Ashoka and Peyahandi

Devika de Silva the sister and niece of the Petitioner who lived in close vicinity, by submitting

affidavits before this court. The said witnesses were silent on any subsequent visit by the police

officers looking for the Petitioner until an officer from the Ahungalla Police Station visited the house

of the Petitioner’s daughter on 24th September and left a police message informing the Petitioner to

be present for an inquiry at the police office Elpitiya. The Respondents were also silent as to the

subsequent investigation carried out by Ambalangoda Police Station to apprehend the Petitioner

who escaped when the police party raided her house on the 23.06.2016. However, it is unusual for

the officers, attached to Ambalangoda police station to have visited Elpitiya area, assisted by a lady

officer, and to have spotted the Petitioner who was travelling in a three-wheeler, when the Petitioner

left the police office Elpitiya since the Senior Superintendent of Police did not turn up for the inquiry.

According to the Petitioner and her son who had tendered an affidavit before this court, the

Petitioner was dragged into a police jeep that was parked near the police office. Except for the copies

of the case record, the Respondents have not produced the arrest notes for the perusal of this court.

10

Similarly, the Respondents has failed to produce the notes with regard to the raid carried out by

several officers from Ambalangoda Police Station on 23.09.2016 at Ahungalle. The two versions given

by the Petitioner and the Respondents contradict each other. According to the Petitioner she was

not in her village on the day the so-called raid was carried out by the Respondents. In addition to the

above, the Respondents had given two versions as to how they decided to carry out the raid at the

Petitioner’s house.

In this regard it is also important to observe the role played by officers attached to Ambalangoda

Police station by conducting a raid at the house of the Petitioner, (as submitted by the Respondent)

which is situated outside the police area of Ambalangoda. It is admitted that the Petitioner as well

as her daughter lived in the police area of Ahungalle Police Station. The Respondents were once again

silent whether they received specific instructions and/or orders to carry out the raid outside their

police area.

With regard to the failure by the Respondents to place relevant information before Court when their

conduct was in question, this court is mindful of the following observation made by Anil Gooneratne

(J) in the case of Kelum Dharsana Kumarasinghe V. S. Hettiarachchi SC FR 108/2010 Supreme Court

Law Reports 2015 387 at 395.

“When the Law enforcement Authorities concerned take steps to deprive persons of their

personal liability by arrest and detention, the Apex Court need to be informed of all details

of such arrest and detention, if such arrest is challenged in court. In the absence of such

details and cogent reasons to arrest the detainees would naturally fortify the case of the

detainees, who have placed material of illegal arrest by the state machinery which sees to

have been abused at that point of time. The liberty of an individual or a group of persons, as

per Article 13 (1) is a matter of great constitutional importance. This liberty should not be

11

interfered with, whatever the status of that person or persons arbitrarily or without legal

justification.”

The fact that the Petitioner lodged a complaint at the Police Headquarters is not denied by the

Respondents before this court. The Petitioner has produced marked P-1 the message said to have

been received from the Ahungalla Police Station with regard to the inquiry. The outcome of the said

inquiry is very much relevant to the instant case, since it will confirm whether the Petitioner was

present in Ahungalla on 23.06.2016 as claimed by the Respondents or she was away from the village

as complained by the Petitioner. In this regard it is important to note that it is the Petitioner who

went to the police Headquarters and lodged the complaint with regard to the conduct of a police

party including the 2nd Respondent on the 23.06.2016 and had returned to the village immediately

after undergoing an eye surgery in order to attend the inquiry with regard to her complaint.

The 4th Respondent, the Inspector General of Police, to whom the complaint was made by the

Petitioner, had neither informed the outcome of the inquiry with regard to the complaint made by

the Petitioner nor had shown any interest to take part in the proceedings of the instant application

before this court.

Having placed the above material, which was revealed during the arguments before the Supreme

Court I will now consider whether the 1st to 3rd or any one of the said Respondent have violated the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Article 12 (1) refers to equality before law, as follows;

“All persons are equal before the Law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law”

The arrest of the Petitioner had taken place near the Police Office Elpitiya when she came to attend

an inquiry before the Senior Superintendent of Police. She was dragged into a police jeep when she

12

protested against the arrest. It is very much clear from the above material that reasons for her arrest

were not explained to her. The Petitioner was unaware of a ‘B’ Report that had been filed before the

Magistrate’s Court of Balapitiya under the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, making her an accused with regard to a raid carried out by the officers of Ambalangoda

Police Station. Otherwise, she would not have made a complaint at the Police Headquarters and

come to Elpitiya to attend the inquiry immediately after undergoing an eye surgery. The material

that was placed before the Magistrate’s Court in the ‘B’ Report is contradictory to the material placed

before this court by the Respondents and the arrest notes that are material to the case before the

Supreme Court had not been produced before Court. The fourth Respondent, the Inspector General

of Police had not informed this Court of the progress with regard to the complaint made by the

Petitioner at the Police Headquarters.

When above facts are considered, it is clear that the Petitioner has not received equal protection of

law. It is the 1st Respondent who had signed the ‘B’ Report with regard to the so-called raid that had

been carried out by several officers including the 2nd Respondent, led by the 3rd Respondent. The

notes made with regard to the said raid are not before us but the Petitioner had lodged a complaint

at the Police Headquarters with regard to an incident that had taken place at her daughter’s place

when the residents were away. The Respondents have neither explained the reason nor had

submitted authority they received to carry out a raid outside the police area of Ambalangoda Police

Station. In such a situation it can also be concluded that the Respondents have fabricated charges

against the Petitioner. This fact is further established from the fact that Petitioner had finally been

discharged from the proceedings before the Magistrate’s Court after being in remand custody for

nearly six months when the Government Analyst could not identify “dangerous drugs” in the samples

submitted to him.

13

When all these matters are considered, I have no hesitation to conclude that the 1st to the 3rd

Respondents are responsible for the above conduct, and therefore had violated the Fundamental

Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. I will now consider whether

the said Respondents have violated the Fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article

13 (1) of the Constitution, which reads as follows;

“No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested

shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.”

From the material that had already been discussed in this judgment, it is clear that the Petitioner was

arrested by a police party including the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents outside the Police Office Elpitiya.

However, it was the position of the Respondents that the Petitioner was arrested at Aruwala Bridge

while she was travelling in a three-wheeler, but arrest notes made by the arresting officer is not

before us for our perusal. Even if the said position is considered as correct, the Respondents had

failed to submit before this court, the information they received in order to apprehend the suspect,

who was required by them with regard to a case already filed in the Magistrate’s Court of Balapitiya.

This arrest had taken place three months after the raid. According to the Petitioner as well as her

son, the police officers had dragged her into a jeep which was parked closer to the Police Office,

when they came out from the Police Office. The above position taken by the Petitioner is not

challenged by the Respondents by submitting arrest notes before us. Subsequent to her arrest a

further report was filed before the Magistrate’s Court signed by the 1st Respondent.

Even though the Petitioner was a ‘wanted suspect’ at the time of her arrest, the law requires the

arresting officer to explain the reason for the arrest. There is no material before this court to

conclude that the reasons for the arrest had been explained to the Petitioner. As already referred to

in this judgment, the Petitioner is unaware of any detection that had taken place on the 23.06.2016

14

involving the Petitioner, and as she was suspicious of the conduct of the Respondents, she had lodged

a complaint at the Police Headquarters. The Respondents have never taken up the position that they

could not arrest the Petitioner until 26th September, since she was evading her arrest or had

absconded to avoid her being arrested. In the said circumstances, it is clear that the Petitioner was

not explained of the reasons for her arrest at the time of her arrest by a police party including the

2nd and the 3rd Respondents and the said Respondents have violated the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioner guaranteed under Article 13 (1) of the Constitution.

For the reasons set out hereinbefore I hold that, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have violated the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents have also violated the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 13 (1) of

the Constitution.

I therefore direct the 1st Respondent to pay Rs. 100000/- to the Petitioner from his personal funds.

I further direct the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to pay Rs. 200000/- by each Respondent to the Petitioner

from their personal funds.

The State is directed to pay Rs. 50000/- as the cost for the litigation.

Application allowed.
