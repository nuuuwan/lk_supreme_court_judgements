DECIDED ON

JANAK DE SILVA, J.

In this matter, Court has granted leave to proceed against the Respondents under Article

12(1) of the Constitution. Further, on 19/01/2022, Court has made a direction in terms of

prayer (d) to the petition, directing the 1A Respondent to reserve a vacancy at Rahula

College, Matara for the 2nd Petitioner.

An application was submitted to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Rahula College, Matara for

the year 2021. The application is marked as P5(a).

According to the applicable circular governing the admission of children to Rahula College,

Matara for the year 2021, a total of 180 students had to be admitted at the interviews

conducted in accordance with the relevant circulars.

In terms of Clause 6.0 of Circular marked P3(a) and the Guidelines marked P4, 25% of the

intake is reserved for the children of Old Boys. Accordingly, for the year 2021, a total of

45 students should have been admitted under the Old Boys Category.

Admittedly, the 2nd Petitioner obtained 50 marks at the interview while the cut off mark

for the Old Boys Category was 55.5.

The learned State Counsel admits that in the event the 2nd Petitioner is found by this Court

to be entitled to 5.5 marks more than what he received, he is entitled to be admitted to

Grade 1 of Rahula College, Matara for the year 2021.

One of the main contentions of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that

they did not get marks for the documents marked P11, P12 and P13.

The learned State Counsel admitted this position but submitted that marks were not

allocated as these 3 documents bear the signature of the Deputy Principal of Sri Rahula

College. The learned State Counsel drew the attention of Court to item No. 7 in the log

entry marked X5 where it is stated that in order to be considered under the Old Boys

Category, the leaving certificate signed by the Principal of Sri Rahula College must be

Page 4 of 6

submitted. Furthermore, it is stated there that if the document signed by the Principal

cannot be produced, the document certified by the person having custody will be

acceptable. It is also observed that item No. 4 therein states that certificates submitted

for consideration under Old Boys Category must be signed by the Principal, Rahula

College, Matara. P11, P12 and P13 do not bear the signature of the Principal, Rahula

College, Matara.

In this regard, Court observes that the leaving certificate marked P7 has been issued by

the Deputy Principal, Rahula College, Matara. However, the Interview Board has

considered this document and given 14 marks for the 2nd Petitioner after having

considered the period his father was a student at Rahula College, Matara.

Having done so, the Interview Panel failed to give the necessary marks for the document

P11, P12 and P13 which have been signed by the Deputy Principal, Rahula College,

Matara. The Interview Panel and the school authorities cannot approbate and reprobate.

Scrutton, L.J. in Verschures Creameries Limited vs. Hull & Netherland Steamship Co. Ltd.

[(1921) 2 KB 608 at 612] held:

"A person cannot say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain

some advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is valid,

and then turn around and say it is void for the purpose of securing some other

advantage. That is to approbate and reprobate the transaction."

Samarakoon C.J. in Visuvalingam and Others v. Liyanage and Others [(1983) 1 Sri L.R. 203

at 227] adopted the principle with a different formulation by stating that one "cannot

blow hot and cold."

Page 5 of 6

In Ranasinghe v. Premadharma and others [(1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 63 at 70] Sharvananda C. J.

held:

In cases where the doctrine of approbation and reprobation applies, the person

concerned has a choice of two rights, either of which he is at liberty to adopt, but

not both. When the doctrine does apply, if the person to whom the choice belongs

irrevocably and with full knowledge accepts the one, he cannot afterwards assert

the other; he cannot affirm and disaffirm.

We are of the view that having accepted P7 and given marks for that document, the

Interview Panel should have also given marks for P11, P12 and P13.

Furthermore, it is observed that before the Appeals Board, the Petitioners produced

documents marked P29a, P29b and P29c signed by the Principal Sri Rahula College Matara

which essentially contained the same contents as P11, P12 and P13. They were not

considered on the basis that they are new documents. In our view, Clause 10.3 of P4 is

wide enough to empower the Appeals Board to consider these 3 documents as they

contained the same contents of the 3 documents submitted to the Interview Panel albeit

signed by the Principal, Rahula College, Matara.

In the aforesaid circumstances, we are of the view that the 1st to 8th Respondents have

acted arbitrarily in refusing to give marks for the 3 documents marked P11, P12 and P13.

The learned State Counsel acting in accordance with the best traditions of the Attorney

Generals Department conceded that the log entries referred to above and the acts of the

1st to 8th Respondents in refusing to give marks to documents P11, P12 and P13 after

giving marks to P7 is arbitrary.

Upon our finding that P11, P12 and P13 are documents that the Interview Panel and the

Appeals Board should have taken cognizance of and given marks, the 2nd Petitioner will

be entitled to 6.5 marks in addition to 50 marks already obtained by him.

Page 6 of 6

Accordingly, 2nd Petitioner becomes entitled to receive 56.5 marks and thus becomes

entitled to be admitted to Grade 1 of Rahula College, Matara for the year 2021.

For the forgoing reasons, we hold that the 1st to 8th Respondents have violated the

fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners in terms of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution by arbitrarily refusing to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade 1 at Rahula

College, Matara for the year 2021. We declare this refusal to be null and void.

We make order directing the 1A Respondent to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade 2 for

the year 2022 at Rahula College, Matara.

Court makes further order awarding the Petitioners compensation in a sum of Rs.

25,000/- to be paid by the 1st to 8th Respondents within 3 months of today.

Application allowed.

Registrar is directed to forthwith communicate this judgment to the 1A Respondent with

copy to the Hon. Attorney General.
