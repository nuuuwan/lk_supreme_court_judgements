Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya

to partition the land known as innawatta morefully described in

the schedule to the plaint among the plaintiff and the 1st to 6th

defendants. The 1st to 5th defendants filed a statement of claim

accepting the pedigree set out in the plaint. The 6th defendant

neither filed a statement of claim nor raised issues but gave

evidence at the trial for the 8th defendant. Although the 7th

defendant filed a statement of claim, it is not clear whether he

10

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

seeks partition of the land or dismissal of the action. Nor did he

raise issues at the trial.

In practical terms, the only contesting defendant was the 8th

defendant, a land developer and land seller who bought a portion

of innawatta (essentially lot 2 in the preliminary plan) from the 6th

defendant by two deeds marked 8V7 and 8V8. The deeds marked

8V9 to 8V24 are the transfer deeds executed by the 6th and 8th

defendants in favour of the 9th to 21st defendants upon blocking

out lot 2. In the prayer to the statement of claim, the 8th defendant

prayed for the exclusion of lot 2 from the corpus. This was the

relief sought by the 8th defendant in his evidence as well. The 9th

to 21st defendants filed a joint statement of claim seeking

exclusion of their lots.

At the trial, apart from the plaintiff, only the 8th defendant raised

issues. The 8th defendant raised three main issues. They relate to

(a) the exclusion of lot 2, (b) acquisition of lot 2 by deeds and

prescription and (c) identification of the corpus. After trial, the

learned District Judge answered these three issues against the 8th

defendant and delivered the judgment partitioning the land as

prayed for by the plaintiff. Three appeals had been filed against

the judgment of the District Court, and after considering the

appeals the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunagala by judgment

dated 24.04.2014 set aside the judgment of the District Court and

allowed the appeals. The plaintiff’s action was dismissed with

costs on the basis that the plaintiff filed the action to partition

a land in extent of 3 lahas of kurakkan sowing area and 3

lahas of kurakkan sowing area is equivalent to 3 acres and

the preliminary plan shows a land more than double the

extent (6 acres, 1 rood and 11 perches) and therefore the

11

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

plaintiff’s action must fail since the land has not been

properly identified. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff to this

court.

This court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the

High Court only on the question of identification of the corpus.

The question of law upon which leave was granted reads as

follows:

Have the High Court judges erred in law by arriving at a

finding that the petitioner has surveyed a larger land than

the corpus described in the schedule to the plaint especially

in considering the fact that no other party has taken any

steps to show a different property as the corpus of the said

partition action and also have not contested during the

course of the trial that the areas of different properties are

included into the corpus depicted in the preliminary plan X?

Execution of deeds after the registration of lis pendens

The plaint was filed on 04.08.1993 and the lis pendens was

registered on 16.08.1993. The dates of execution of the two deeds

(8V7 and 8V8) through which the 8th defendant acquired rights to

the land from the 6th defendant are significant. The deed 8V7

dated 03.01.1993 had been executed seven months before the lis

pendens was registered and the deed 8V8 dated 01.12.1994 was

executed after the lis pendens had been registered. The deeds

marked 8V9 to 8V24 are the transfer deeds executed by the 6th

and 8th defendants in favour of the 9th to 21st defendants upon

sub-division of lot 2. Of these, except for 8V9 and 8V12, all the

other deeds have been executed after the lis pendens was

registered: 8V9 was executed one week before and 8V12 was

12

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

executed two days before the institution of the action. No issue

was raised at the trial challenging due registration of the lis

pendens. All these deeds executed after the lis pendens was duly

registered are void in terms of section 66(2) of the Partition Law,

No. 21 of 1977 (Virasinghe v. Virasinghe [2002] 1 Sri LR 1). Section

66 of the Partition Law reads as follows:

66(1) After a partition action is duly registered as a lis

pendens under the Registration of Documents Ordinance no

voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation of any

undivided share or interest of or in the land to which the

action relates shall be made or effected until the final

determination of the action by dismissal thereof, or by the

entry of a decree of partition under section 36 or by the entry

of a certificate of sale.

(2) Any voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation made or

effected in contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) of

this section shall be void;

Provided that any such voluntary alienation, lease or

hypothecation shall, in the event of the partition action being

dismissed, be deemed to be valid.

(3) Any assignment, after the institution of a partition action,

of a lease or hypothecation effected prior to the registration

of such partition action as a lis pendens shall not be affected

by the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

But this section does not prohibit alienation, lease or

hypothecation of an interest to which a co-owner may ultimately

become entitled by virtue of the decree in a pending action

(Sirisoma v. Sarnelis Appuhamy (1950) 51 NLR 337, Sillie

13

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

Fernando v. Silman Fernando (1962) 64 NLR 404, Karunaratne v.

Perera (1966) 67 NLR 529). The contesting defendants’ deeds do

not fall into this category. They are voluntarily executed outright

transfers of defined portions.

Was the identification of the corpus a real issue before the

District Court?

In the prayer to his statement of claim, the 8th defendant only

sought exclusion of lot 2 in the preliminary plan from the corpus,

not the dismissal of the action, on the basis that the corpus has

not been properly identified. However, at the trial, the 8th

defendant raised the following vague issue (issue No. 6) on the

identification of the corpus:

Is the land proposed to be partitioned not properly shown on

the preliminary plan?

If so, can the plaintiff maintain this action?

It is important to realise that there is a distinction between

contesting the case on the basis that the land to be partitioned is

not properly depicted in the preliminary plan and seeking

exclusion of a particular lot depicted in the preliminary plan on a

different basis such as prescription.

The reason I say the above issue is vague is because the 8th

defendant does not say whether a larger land is surveyed or a

smaller land is surveyed or from which side of the land (boundary)

the expansion or shrinkage, if at all, has taken place. In my view,

given the scheme of the Partition Law, it is unfair to allow a party

in a partition action to raise such an unspecific and vague

issue/point of contest for the first time at the trial.

14

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

Issues are raised to narrow down the scope of the trial and for the

trial to be conducted with discipline. Issues must be specific for

the opposite parties to meet and the presiding Judge to

understand the real dispute or disputes between the parties and

answer them properly. Technically, it is the duty of the presiding

Judge to raise issues but practically it is the duty of counsel for

the respective parties to raise correct issues. Practitioners of the

District Court know this ground reality.

The preliminary plan was tendered to court on 08.09.1998

(Journal Entry No. 28) and the court gave several dates to

consider the preliminary plan: vide inter alia JE No. 30 dated

24.11.1998, JE No. 31 dated 23.02.1999, JE No. 33 dated

04.05.1999, JE No. 39 dated 05.10.1999 and JE No. 40 dated

18.01.2000.

Although the 8th defendant filed his statement of claim dated

25.04.2000 more than 1 ½ years after the preliminary plan had

been tendered to court, he never stated in his statement of claim

or at any time thereafter until the said vague issue No. 6 was

raised at the trial that the land to be partitioned was not properly

depicted in the preliminary plan and therefore the plaintiff’s

action must fail.

If the land to be partitioned was not properly depicted in the

preliminary plan, what should the 8th defendant have done?

I accept that there is an overarching obligation cast upon the

District Judge hearing a partition action to satisfy himself that

the land is properly identified. If the corpus cannot be properly

identified, investigation of the title does not arise. The title needs

to be investigated on a properly identified corpus. However, this

15

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

does not mean that identification of the corpus is exclusively left

to the District Judge. It is the duty of the relevant parties to assist

the court and make applications for the court to make incidental

orders to identify the corpus if there is a question on the

identification of the corpus.

In the case of Dharmaratana Thero v. Siyadoris [1995] 2 Sri LR

245, the contention of counsel for the petitioner was that the

District Judge was in serious error when he refused the

application to register the lis pendens in respect of the larger land

on the basis of belatedness by first failing to carry out the

imperative duty imposed upon the District Judge under section

19(2)(b) of the Partition Law which reads “Where any defendant

seeks to have a larger land made the subject matter of the action

as provided in paragraph (a) of this sub-section, the court shall

specify the party to the action by whom and the date on or before

which an application for the registration of the action as a lis

pendens affecting such larger land shall be filed in court, and the

estimated costs of survey, of such larger land as determined by

court shall be deposited in court.” In response to this contention,

G.P.S. de Silva J. (later C.J.) held at 246-247:

It would appear that on a literal reading of the section, the

duty is cast on the court to specify the party by whom an

application for the registration of the action as a lis pendens

in respect of the larger land has to be filed. But the relevant

question is, at what point of time does such duty arise? It

seems to me that the duty of the court arises only upon the

party defendant interested in having the larger land

partitioned moving the court to make the appropriate order in

terms of the section. This is a matter which would normally

16

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

come up in the course of the motion roll and it was surely the

duty of the Attorney-at-Law representing the petitioner to

have invited the court to make the required order. How else

is the court to be made aware of the need to make an order

in terms of section 19(2)(b)? The interpretation contended for

on behalf of the petitioner would place an undue burden on

the court.

Concluding a partition case is a costly and time-consuming

process. The law makes provision for a defendant who raises

concerns about the identification of the corpus to do so before the

case is taken up for trial and during the course of the trial.

Without taking such steps, a defendant in a partition action

cannot scuttle the whole process, which has run into several

decades, by taking up the position that the corpus has not been

properly identified for the first time on appeal. Merely raising an

open-ended issue on the identification of the corpus is

insufficient. A partition case is not a criminal case to create doubt

about the plaintiff’s case and remain silent. Although technically

there are plaintiffs and defendants in a partition case as in any

other civil case, practically all parties play a dual role in a

partition action; a defendant today can become the plaintiff

tomorrow and vice versa for the prosecution of the action to

termination (section 70 of the Partition Law).

In terms of section 16(1) of the Partition Law, the court issues a

commission to survey the land and prepare the preliminary plan

depicting the land sought to be partitioned. According to section

16(2), on the application of any party, the court can direct the

surveyor to survey any larger or smaller land than that pointed

out by the plaintiff to the surveyor.

17

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

Section 16(2) reads as follows:

The commission issued to a surveyor under subsection (1) of

this section shall be substantially in the form set out in the

second schedule to this Law and shall have attached thereto

a copy of the plaint certified as a true copy by the registered

attorney for the plaintiff.

The court may, on such terms as to costs of survey or

otherwise, issue a commission at the instance of any

party to the action, authorizing the surveyor to survey any

larger or smaller land than that pointed out by the plaintiff

where such party claims that such survey is necessary for

the adjudication of the action.

Such an application was not made by the contesting defendants

including the 8th defendant. Nor did the 8th defendant get a

separate commission issued to another surveyor and have that

plan superimposed on the preliminary plan for the court to

understand the real issue on the identification of the corpus and

come to a correct conclusion.

Section 19(2) of the Partition Law lays down a detailed procedure

to be followed by a defendant who seeks to have a larger land

partitioned. In short, such a defendant shall take afresh all the

steps that a plaintiff in a partition action shall take, which include

compliance with the provisions of sections 12-18 of the Partition

Law.

Section 18(1) deals with the return of the surveyor’s commission

after the preliminary survey. Section 18(2) enacts inter alia that

the preliminary plan and report may be used as evidence without

18

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

further proof subject to the surveyor being summoned to give oral

testimony on the application of any party to the action.

Section 18(2) of the Partition Law reads as follows:

The documents referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of

subsection (1) of this section may, without further proof, be

used as evidence of the facts stated or appearing therein at

any stage of the partition action:

Provided that the court shall, on the application of any

party to the action and on such terms as may be

determined by the court, order that the surveyor shall be

summoned and examined orally on any point or matter

arising on, or in connection with, any such document or any

statement of fact therein or any relevant fact which is alleged

by any party to have been omitted therefrom.

At the trial, the preliminary plan and the report were marked X

and X1 respectively by the plaintiff. If any of the contesting

defendants thought that a larger land had erroneously been

included, such defendant could have summoned the surveyor to

give evidence and sought clarifications. This was not done.

What was the real issue put forward by the 8th defendant at

the trial?

The 8th defendant (by issue No. 7) sought exclusion of lot 2 on the

basis that lot 2 is a defined portion of innawatta, which he

acquired on deeds and prescription:

Is the 8th defendant entitled to lot 2 of the preliminary plan

on deeds and prescription as stated in the statement of claim

of him?

19

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

The exclusion of lot 2 in favour of the 9th to 21st defendants was

the only concern of the 8th defendant at the trial. The 8th

defendant in his evidence has not gone into the conversion of

traditional land measures to English equivalents.

In my view, there was no live issue at the trial that the preliminary

plan depicts a land double in extent of the land sought to be

partitioned as concluded by the High Court of Civil Appeal.

Is a land double in extent of the land sought to be partitioned

depicted in the preliminary plan?

The 8th defendant purchased lot 2 in the preliminary plan from

the 6th defendant. According to the 6th defendant, after his father’s

testamentary case (8V2), innawatta devolved on him and his elder

brother. In the testamentary case, innawatta was described as a

land of 4 acres.

Thereafter, upon an arrangement between the 6th defendant and

his brother, the deed of exchange 8V3 dated 09.01.1981 had been

executed conveying the rights of the 6th defendant’s brother in

innawatta to the 6th defendant. In 8V3, innawatta was described

as a land in extent of about 5 acres, not 4 acres or exactly 5 acres.

The 6th defendant got plan 8V4 dated 19.11.1984 prepared after

this arrangement. According to this plan, innawatta comprises 5

acres, 1 rood and 28 perches.

The 7th defendant in paragraph 2 of his statement of claim (filed

more than one year after the preliminary plan was sent to court)

states that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action as the plaintiff

has filed the action to partition a portion of innawatta. In other

20

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

words, his contention was that a smaller land is shown in the

preliminary plan.

As seen from pages 270 and 272 of the brief, even counsel for the

9th to 21st defendants suggested to the plaintiff during cross-

examination that a portion on the northern boundary has been

left out in the preliminary plan, suggesting that a smaller land

had been surveyed.

When it was suggested to the plaintiff by counsel for the 9th to 21st

defendants at page 269 of the brief that one laha of kurakkan

sowing area in the north western province is equivalent to one

acre, the plaintiff has denied it and stated that one laha of

kurakkan sowing area is equivalent to two acres, although he has

later admitted by answering a leading question at page 271 that

3 acres means 3 lahas.

The 6th defendant at pages 355 and 363 of the brief has admitted

in cross-examination that 3 lahas of kurakkan sowing area is

equivalent to around six acres of land.

It is clear that there was uncertainty about the extent of

innawatta.

During the argument, it was stated that the exclusion of lot 2 is

sought based on an amicable partition identifying lot 2 as a long-

standing distinct and defined portion.

According to the original plan 8V4, the line between lot 1 and 2

drawn on that plan in red is an artificial line drawn by the

surveyor but not found on the ground. The northern point of that

line is a “stake” and the southern point is a “hik” tree. Far from

proof of adverse possession, there is no cogent evidence to say

21

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

that lot 2 was a defined portion for well over 10 years before the

institution of this action to claim prescriptive title to lot 2.

The contesting defendants find fault with the plaintiff for not

producing the alleged amicable partition deed No. 24134 dated

17.03.1939, which the plaintiff has referred to in paragraph 8 of

the plaint. At the argument, learned President’s Counsel for the

plaintiff stated that the plaintiff does not have this amicable

partition deed but referred to it since one deed (1V1) refers to the

amicable partition deed. The plaintiff does not accept this

amicable partition deed. The exclusion of lot 2 is sought not by

the plaintiff but by the contesting defendants. If the contesting

defendants rely on this deed to say that lot 2 in the preliminary

plan was a divided lot from the rest of the land from the time the

alleged amicable partition deed was executed, the burden is on

them to prove it inter alia by producing that deed. This was not

done.

By deed No. 24137 executed on 17.03.1939 (1V1), the predecessor

in title of the 6th defendant and the 8th defendant, namely Lewis

Senerath, transferred an undivided 1 rood out of lot A of

innawatta in extent of 2 acres and 2.5 perches to David

Appuhamy, and David Appuhamy in turn transferred that portion

to the 1st defendant by deed P6 dated 21.08.1985. These two

deeds are accepted by the 6th and 8th defendants.

The present 1st defendant filed partition action No. 10524/P (8V1)

against the present 6th defendant and others based on deed P6. It

is misleading to say that according to 8V1, innawatta comprises

only 2 acres and 2.5 perches; this is only part of innawatta which

has been identified as lot A of innawatta.

22

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

Although a partition action cannot be settled in this manner, as

seen from page 567 of the brief, the said partition action was

settled between the present 1st and 6th defendants allowing the

present 1st defendant to demarcate 1 rood with the assistance of

a surveyor. If lot 2 was entirely possessed by the 6th and 8th

defendants and their predecessors as a separate and defined lot,

there was no reason for the 6th defendant to arrive at such a

settlement. Although the 8th defendant tendered selected

documents of the said partition action compendiously marked as

8V1, he did not tender any of the plans referred to in the plaint

and settlement in that case.

The deed 8V5 dated 09.06.1993 was tendered by the 8th

defendant. The original of 8V5 was marked by the plaintiff as P7.

The schedule of 8V5 (which I have reproduced below) goes to show

that innawatta of about 5 acres in extent was still an undivided

land in 1993. By this deed, the 6th defendant had transferred 3

perches to the 1st defendant (in terms of the settlement reached

in 10524/P) out of 5 acres, not out of lot A comprising 2 acres and

2.5 perches.

As I have already stated, the 6th defendant had prepared plan 8V4

after the execution of deed of exchange 8V3. When 8V4 is

compared with the preliminary plan, there is no issue regarding

the northern, southern and western boundaries of innawatta.

Those three boundaries tally. The only boundary at variance is

the eastern boundary.

It is significant to note that according to 8V3, although the eastern

boundary of innawatta is the road leading to Pahala Galayaya and

the land of the heirs of Chalo Sinno, the eastern boundary of 8V4

does not extend up to the road, but the eastern boundary in the

preliminary plan does. This means plan 8V4 does not depict the

eastern boundary of innawatta correctly.

24

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

All this indicates that the summary disposal of the long-drawn-

out partition case by the learned High Court Judges, without

analysing any evidence but by the mechanical application of a

standard formula that 1 laha of kurakkan sowing area is

equivalent to 1 acre and therefore the land depicted in the

preliminary plan is double in extent of the land to be partitioned

and hence the plaintiff’s action must fail, is clearly erroneous.

Where did the High Court of Civil Appeal go wrong?

The finding of the learned High Court Judges which is reflected in

the following paragraph of the judgment is contradictory.

The preliminary plan shows a land of 6 acres 1 rood and 11

perches. The plaintiff has admitted in evidence that the

northern boundary of the land has not been properly

demarcated, hence the subject matter is not correctly

depicted and that the land sought to be partitioned is 3 lahas

of kurakkan sowing which is equivalent to 3 acres. The land

shown in the preliminary plan is more than double that

extent.

On the one hand, the learned High Court Judges say that a

portion of the northern boundary has been left out (i.e. the entire

land has not been included in the preliminary plan) and on the

other hand they say that more than double the extent has been

included in the preliminary plan.

The learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal presupposed

that one laha of kurakkan sowing area is one acre. They

considered this a rigid, fixed formula whereas it is not so.

25

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

In the case of paddy land, it was held in Ariyawathie De Silva v.

Wijesena (CA/608/2000/F, CA Minutes of 01.04.2019) that there

was “no hard and fast rule that one amunam or five pelas of paddy

sowing area shall necessarily equal to 2 ½ Acres”.

As held in Hapuarachchi v. Podi Nilame (SC/APPEAL/52/2018,

SC Minutes of 10.06.2021), it is wholly unreliable to convert

ancient land measures to English standard equivalents in

identifying the corpus in a partition action. The extent of

innawatta described in the old deeds tendered by the plaintiff is

3 lahas of kurakkan sowing area (P1 executed in 1893, P2

executed in 1903, P3 executed in 1916, P5 executed in 1939). The

schedule to the plaint is a reproduction of the land described in

these old deeds executed more than a century ago. Without

surveyor plans being available, the extent of the land given in

these old deeds is speculative. It was a common occurrence at

that time for a deed to purport to convey either much more or

much less than what a person was entitled to.

I accept that according to standard conversion tables found in

various sources, one laha of kurakkan sowing area is equal to one

acre (vide The Ceylon Law Recorder, Parts VI and IX of Vol XXII,

Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy [2002] 1 Sri LR 65 at 81); but the court

cannot strictly go by this formula disregarding all other factors in

deciding the extent of the land. The question of identification of

the corpus is not a mathematical question where mechanical

application of a standard formula is appropriate. It is a question

of fact and not a question of law which can be raised for the first

time on appeal. This is amply demonstrable by the judgment in

Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy itself where the standard conversion

table is reproduced.

26

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

In Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy, the plaintiff filed a partition action

seeking to partition a land of 4 lahas of kurakkan sowing extent.

The extent of the land shown in the preliminary plan was 8 acres,

1 rood and 16 perches, which the contesting defendants

contended was far in excess of the extent described in the

schedule to the plaint. Counsel for the defendants contended that

the English equivalent to the customary Sinhala measure of 1

laha of kurakkan sowing extent is 1 acre and the preliminary plan

depicted a land more than double in extent (which is the same

argument taken up in the instant case). However, upon

consideration of the totality of the evidence led in the case, the

District Court held that the preliminary plan depicts the correct

land to be partitioned, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

On appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the Judgment of the Court

of Appeal, which is reported in Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy [2005]

1 Sri LR 303. Justice Udalagama in the Supreme Court stated at

307-308:

I would also reiterate the observations of the President of the

Court of Appeal in the impugned judgment that land

measures computed on the basis of land required to be sown

with Kurakkan vary from district to district depending on the

fertility of soil and quality of grain and in the said

circumstances difficult to correlate the sowing extent with

accuracy. Thus there cannot be a definite basis for the

contention that 1 Laha sowing extent be it Kurakkan or even

paddy would be equivalent to 1 acre.

This is a common issue confronted by judges and lawyers in

partition actions where the extent of the land in old deeds is given

by way of traditional land measures based on paddy or kurakkan

27

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

sowing extent without reference to a plan. In those days, the

surface area was measured by the quantity of seed required to

sow the land. The plaintiff reproduces in the schedule to the plaint

the schedule to old deeds prepared decades if not centuries ago

as the land to be partitioned, as in the instant case, whereas the

surveyor commissioned to prepare the preliminary plan shows the

existing boundaries of the land, not the old boundaries stated in

the schedule to the plaint. The surveyor further shows the extent

of the land in English standard measures and not ancient land

measures. The difficulties arise when the traditional land

measures are compared with English standard equivalents.

There is no rigid correlation between surface extents and sowing

extents although surface extent is decided on sowing extent. Such

a correlation depends on various factors including the size and

quality of the grain, the fertility of the soil, the peculiarities of the

sower and local conditions (e.g. the violence of the wind at the

time of sowing and the water supply to the sowing area). In

unfertile soil the seed would be sown thicker than in fertile soil.

An inexperienced sower would scatter seeds unevenly, requiring

more seeds than an experienced sower. If the quality of the grain,

be it paddy or kurakkan, is poor, more grain would be necessary

than if the quality were high.

Law Recorder Miscellany, page xxx, in The Ceylon Law Recorder,

Vol XXII, Part VI records:

The amount of seed required varied according to the varying

degrees of fertility in different parts of the Island, as fertile

soil does not require as much seed as poor soil. For instance,

an amunam in a fertile area will sometimes be twice as many

square feet as an amunam in an unfertile area.

28

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

It is also relevant to note that the sizes (capacity) of the traditional

measures such as lahas and neliyas differ not only between

districts but also within districts. In the instant case the measure

under consideration was laha. In this regard, Law Recorder

Miscellany, page xlv, in The Ceylon Law Recorder, Vol XXII, Part

IX, reproducing an extract from a paper presented by the then

Superintendent of Surveyors, states:

The Laha was also a measure of varying size. Within the

same district and sometimes in the same Chief Headman’s

division, in different parts, a different size of Laha was in

use. In the North-Western Province alone, in different parts,

these are in use even today, four sizes of Lahas containing

in capacity, 4, 5, 6 and 7 Neliyas respectively. The largest

size of Laha according to my investigations is one in use in

the Inamaluwa Korale of Matale North, and contains twelve

Nelis.

This is not a recent phenomenon. The following observation made

by Canekeratne J. as far back as in 1948 in the case of Noordeen

Lebbe v. Shahul Hameed 49 NLR 274 at 276 highlights the

imprecise nature of traditional land measures and the necessity

to look for other evidence in deciding the extent of the land:

Though the description by paddy sowing extent is not an

absolutely precise measurement, it can be determined within

a fairly definite limits and most villagers in the locality would

be able to show the extent: the evidence led shows that one

pela is about ¾ of an acre. Then one comes to the

boundaries.

29

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

When there is a question of identification of the corpus, the court

cannot merely go by the extent given in the deed. The court must

take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of that

particular case, including the boundaries given in the deeds, the

conduct of the parties and the totality of the evidence led at the

trial to come to the correct conclusion.

In Noordeen Lebbe v. Shahul Hameed (1948) 49 NLR 274, two

contiguous lots of land referred to as the eastern lot and the

western lot were sold in execution of a mortgage decree. The

auctioneer’s conveyance described each lot separately but further

described the two lots by way of a survey plan which erroneously

depicted only the western lot. The son of the original owner took

up the position that only the western lot was conveyed by the

auctioneer’s conveyance. Although the District Court accepted

this position, on appeal, the Supreme Court reversed this finding

and held “both lots passed to the purchaser on the conveyance. The

addition of an erroneous plan did not vitiate an adequate and

sufficient definition with certainty of what was intended to pass by

the deed.” The Supreme Court at page 275 observed “the Court

must look at the conveyance in the light of the circumstances which

surrounded it in order to ascertain what was therein expressed as

the intention of the parties” and further explained at 276-277

“where there are several descriptions which, when evidence of

surrounding facts is admitted, are not consistent with each other,

the Court must in every case do the best it can to arrive at the true

meaning of the parties upon a fair consideration of the language

used and the facts properly admissible in evidence. The description

by reference to the plan when taken with the earlier part of the

schedule is inaccurate and misleading. The descriptions contained

in the earlier part of the schedule are certain and unambiguous.”

30

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

In the instant case there is no inconsistency as to the extent

because that matter cannot be decided solely on what is stated in

conversion tables. Even assuming there is such an inconsistency,

if the boundaries are clearly ascertainable, discrepancy in the

extent can be reconciled or disregarded.

In Gabriel Perera v. Agnes Perera [1950] 43 CLW 82, the

boundaries of the land were given in the deed without reference

to a plan and the extent was stated to be about 1 rood and 5

perches whereas it was in fact 1 rood and 22 perches. Basnayake

J. at page 88 held:

It is settled rule of interpretation of deeds that, where the

portion conveyed is perfectly described, and can be precisely

ascertained, and no difficulty arises except from a

subsequent inconsistent statement as to its extent, the

inconsistency as to extent should be treated as a mere falsa

demonstratio not affecting that which is already sufficiently

conveyed.

In Silva v. Ismail (1943) 44 NLR 550 it was held that in describing

the property in a conveyance, if specific dimensions of the

premises sold are given at the beginning of the schedule (e.g. in

Silva’s case, seventy and a half feet in length and thirty feet in

width together with the entire boutique), those specific

dimensions must control the description of the boundaries given

at the end of the schedule.

Appuhamy v. Gallella (1976) 78 NLR 404 is a similar case where

in the deed the extent of the land was followed by the boundaries,

not vice versa as usually happens. The question was whether only

10 perches or the entire land containing about 40 perches was

31

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

transferred by the deed. The uncertainty arose from the

inconsistent descriptions of the extent: the area description

covered 10 perches while the boundary description was about 40

perches. Taking all the circumstances into account, the Supreme

Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and held that

the deed conveyed only 10 perches and not the entire land falling

within the boundaries in the schedule. The Supreme Court

expounded the governing principles in the following manner:

Where the extent of a grant of land is stated in an ambiguous

manner in a conveyance, it is legitimate to look at the

conveyance in the light of the circumstances which

surrounded it in order to ascertain what was therein

expressed as the intention of the parties. It is permissible to

resort to extrinsic evidence in order to resolve the ambiguity

relating to the subject matter referred to in the conveyance.

In such circumstances it is proper to have regard to the

subsequent conduct of each of the parties, especially when

such conduct amounts to an admission against the party’s

proprietary interest.

In my view, the description of innawatta contained in the 6th

defendant’s deed of exchange marked 8V3 (where the eastern

boundary of innawatta is the road) read with the 6th respondent’s

plan marked 8V4 (where the eastern boundary of innawatta is not

the road) makes it clear that the preliminary plan marked X

(where the eastern boundary of innawatta is the road) depicts the

entire extent of innawatta (6 acres, 1 rood and 11 perches) and it

is erroneous to say that the preliminary plan shows a land more

than double in extent of innawatta.

32

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

Application of previously decided cases

The learned High Court Judges and learned counsel for the

contesting defendants strongly rely on Sopaya Silva v. Magilin

Silva [1989] 2 Sri LR 105 to justify the dismissal of the partition

action by the High Court on the basis that there is a significant

discrepancy in the extents of the lands described in the plaintiff’s

deeds and the preliminary plan. Learned counsel for the 6th

defendant in her written submissions even cautions that the

principles enumerated in Sopaya Silva’s case should be upheld

and consistency in the law regarding identification of the corpus

maintained.

The principles of law enunciated in one case have no universal

application to all future cases of the same species indiscriminately

unless the facts are similar. Bearing in mind the established

principles of law, each case must be decided on the unique facts

and circumstances of that particular case. The ratio decidendi in

Sopaya Silva’s case cannot be mechanically applied whenever

there is an issue in relation to the identification of the corpus in

a partition action.

In Sopaya Silva’s case the plaintiff filed action to partition a land

in extent of 8 acres, 3 roods and 29 perches but the surveyor

prepared the preliminary plan in extent of 11 acres, 1 rood and

33 perches. There was no contest in the case. Having found this

discrepancy at the time of writing the judgment regarding the

extent of land sought to be partitioned and the land surveyed, the

District Judge dismissed the action on the basis that a larger land

had been surveyed. This he did without hearing the parties on

that matter. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the

dismissal of the action without hearing the parties was wrong and

33

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

what the District Judge ought to have done was to reissue the

commission with instructions to survey the land as described in

the plaint or to permit the plaintiff or any of the defendants to

seek partition of the larger land after taking steps including the

registration of a fresh lis pendens.

The facts in the instant case are totally different. In the instant

case there was no denial of a hearing to the parties on the issue

of the identification of the corpus or any other matter. More

importantly, in Sopaya Silva’s case the plaintiff sought to

partition a specific extent of land, namely, 11 acres, 1 rood and

33 perches, presumably identified by way of a plan, whereas in

the instant case the extent given was not specific as it was stated

in an ancient Sinhala land measure, namely 3 palas of kurakkan

sowing area. Hence the learned High Court Judges erred in

concluding that the guidelines given in Sopaya Silva’s case should

have been followed in this case.

The other case the learned High Court Judges cite is Jayasuriya

v. Ubaid (1957) 61 NLR 352. In Jayasuriya’s case, the plaintiff filed

action to partition lot 160/6 in T.P. 269370 in extent of 3 acres,

1 rood and 7 perches. The plaintiff claimed ½ share and pleaded

that the other ½ share should go to the 1st defendant. The 1st

defendant disputed the corpus. At the trial, the preliminary plan

was not marked in evidence. When this was raised by counsel for

the 1st defendant at the closing submissions, the District Judge,

without issuing summons to the surveyor who prepared the

preliminary plan, issued a fresh commission to another surveyor

in the belief that the first surveyor would not be available. The 1st

defendant did not take part in the further hearing. When the new

surveyor gave evidence on the new plan, it transpired that the

34

SC/APPEAL/82/2020

land which the plaintiff in fact wanted to partition was not lot

160/6 in T.P. 269370 but lot 1 in T.P. 269370 and two other lots

that fell outside the said Title Plan. The District Judge delivered

the judgment on the mistaken assumption that the first plan and

the second plan both depicted the same corpus. On appeal, the

judgment of the District Court was rightly set aside and retrial

was ordered. It is in this backdrop that the Supreme Court

observed “there was a duty cast on the Judge to satisfy himself as

to the identity of the land sought to be partitioned, and for this

purpose it was always open to him to call for further evidence in

order to make a proper investigation”. I need hardly emphasise

that the facts in Jayasuriya’s case and the instant case are

incomparable.

Although learned counsel for some of the contesting defendants

state that a larger land than that sought to be partitioned was

ultimately partitioned without a new lis pendens being registered,

there was no necessity to register a fresh lis pendens for a larger

extent of land because no larger land is depicted in the

preliminary plan.

Conclusion

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the finding of the

District Court that the preliminary plan depicts the land sought

to be partitioned is justifiable. The finding of the High Court of

Civil Appeal that the corpus has not been properly identified and

therefore the plaintiff’s action is bound to fail cannot be allowed

to stand. I answer the question of law upon which leave to appeal

was granted in the affirmative and set aside the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal and restore the judgment of the District

Court and allow the appeal of the plaintiff with costs.
