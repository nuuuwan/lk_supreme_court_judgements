This is an appeal against the order of the learned judge of the Commercial High Court

dated August 26, 2019.

Leave to appeal was granted in respect of the following questions of law:

(1) The learned Commercial High Court Judge failed to consider the order of

dated 31st October 2017 entering the terms of settlement was only between

the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants and not between the other

Defendants

(2) The learned Commercial High Court Judge failed to consider that in terms of

the order entered by the learned Commercial High Court Judge on the 31st

October 2017 with regard to the entering of the decree, there was no decree

entered by as per said settlement against the Petitioner

Page 4 of 12

The issues to be determined are related to the terms of the settlement entered on

October 31, 2017. Therefore, I will not make any reference to the factual matrix of the

action except to the extent that it may impinge on the terms of the settlement.

The Court called for the original record of the Commercial High Court and, after examining

the case record, the proceedings of October 31, 2017 read as follows:

The basic question to be decided is whether the 4th Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as Appellant) is a party to the terms of the settlement entered on October

31, 2017.

Section 408 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the adjustment of actions and

reads as follows:

If an action be adjusted wholly or part by any lawful agreement or compromise,

or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole or any part of the

matter of the action, such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction shall be notified

to the court by motion made in presence of, or on notice to, all the parties

concerned, and the court shall pass a decree in accordance therewith, so far as it

relates to the action, and such decree shall be final, so far as relates to so much of

Page 7 of 12

the subject-matter of the action as is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction. (Emphasis added)

The foundation of a consent decree is the consensus ad idem of the parties. For this

reason, section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code directs that the Court should pass a decree

in accordance with the terms of the settlement. Case law emphasizes the need to comply

with this and other relevant provisions to ensure that any settlement entered is based on

the mutual consent of the parties.

Any settlement or compromise must conform strictly to the provisions of sections 91 and

408 of the Civil Procedure Code. If the compromise was lacking in precision and did not

strictly conform to sections 91 and 408 of the Civil Procedure Code and it leads to

confusion and uncertainty, any decree entered on it could be attacked on the ground of

want of mutuality [Faleel v. Argeen and Others (2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 48]. Thus, in Dassanaike

v. Dassanaike (30 N.L.R. 385 at 387), Fisher, C. J. observed:

It is fundamentally necessary before section 408 can be applied that it should be

clearly established that what is put forward as an agreement or compromise of an

action by the parties was intended by them to be such.

No doubt settlement of an action between the parties is welcome. In fact, settlement

between parties should be encouraged by the Court to the extent possible in law provided

that applications to pursue a settlement are not made with a view to delay the

proceedings or to merely obtain a date. However, before any such settlement is entered

and decree entered accordingly, the procedural steps mandated by law must scrupulously

be observed to ensure that the terms of the settlement are based on the consent of all

the parties whose rights are affected by it.

That appears to be the reason for section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code to require any

settlement to be notified to the Court by way of motion made in the presence of, or on

notice to, all the parties concerned. It directs that such agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion. In my view, these words require

the terms of the settlement to be incorporated into a motion signed by the registered

attorney for all parties to the settlement. There can be no room for any dispute once

terms are recorded in a motion and the parties concerned have indicated their consent

Page 8 of 12

by the registered attorney-at-law signing the motion containing the terms of the

settlement.

This Court has added safeguards to be followed in concluding settlement arrangements

to ensure that they reflect the intention of the parties. Thus Soertsz, J. observed in

Punchibanda v. Punchibanda et al (42 N.L.R. 382):

This Court has often pointed out that when settlements, adjustments, admissions,

&c., are reached or made, their nature should be explained clearly to the parties,

and their signatures of thumb impressions should be obtained. The consequence of

this obvious precaution not being taken is that this Court has its work unduly

increased by wasteful appeals and by applications being made to it for revision or

restitutio in integrum. One almost receives the impression that once a settlement

is adumbrated, those concerned, in their eagerness to accomplish it, refrain from

probing the matter thoroughly lest the settlement fall through.

Regrettably, I note that the terms of settlement in this case have not been incorporated

into a motion as required by law. Instead, the terms were recorded in open court on

October 31, 2017. After the terms of settlement were entered, the learned judge of the

Commercial High Court, directed that the decree be entered between the Plaintiff and the

1st and 2nd Defendants only. This order was made despite an application to enter a consent

decree between the Plaintiff and the 1st , 2nd and Appellant.

Moreover, journal entry no. 17 pertaining to this date, part of which appears to have been

written in English by the learned judge of the Commercial High Court, reads:

Terms of Settlement were recorded between the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd

Defendants.Enter Decree accordinglyRepresentatives of the parties are

directed to sign the record.

The record reflects that only the representatives of the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd

Defendants have signed the record. There is no signature of any representative of the

Appellant.

Page 9 of 12

To my mind, the learned judge of the Commercial High Court did not have any doubt when

the settlement was recorded on 31st October, 2017 that only the Plaintiff and the 1st and

2nd Defendants were parties to the terms of the settlement. That appears to be the reason

for the journal entry written by the learned judge to state that the terms of settlement

were entered into between the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants. This is

complimented by the order he made on that date, directing that the decree be entered

between the Plaintiff and 1st and 2nd Defendants according to the terms of the settlement.

The matter is put beyond doubt by the fact that only the representatives of the Plaintiff

and the 1st and 2nd Defendants have signed the record.

However, the learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent drew the attention of the

Court to the proceedings of October 31, 2017 and submitted that the Appellant was

represented by Ms. Udayani Madanayake, Attorney-at-Law and as such the terms of

settlement are binding on the Appellant. Indeed, her name appears in the proxy filed on

behalf of the Appellant in the Commercial High Court.

It is trite law that the Attorney-at-Law on record has the authority to enter into a

settlement on behalf of a party [Fernando v. Sinnoris Appu (20 N.L.R. 460), Punchibanda

v. Punchibanda et al (42 N.L.R. 382), Sinna Veloo v. Messrs. Lipton Limited (66 N.L.R. 214)].

Nevertheless, it must be clear from the record that registered attorney on record

accepted the terms of the settlement on behalf of the party he represents. Such an

agreement will be clearly reflected if the provisions of section 408 of the Civil Procedure

Code are scrupulously followed by submitting a consent motion to the court. Regrettably

it has not been done in this case.

It is customary for appearances by all parties to be recorded on each date when there is

a public hearing. In my view, the mere fact that the appearance of Ms. Udayani

Madanayake, Attorney-at-Law is recorded on October 31, 2017 for the Appellant does not

amount to any consent on the part of the Appellant to the terms of the settlement.

This Court observes that in this case five (5) terms are recorded as part of the settlement.

The tenor in the five terms refers to admission by two parties () or by 1st and

2nd Defendants (1,2 ). This negates any claim that the Appellant agreed to the

terms of the settlement. However, the learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent drew

Page 10 of 12

the Court's attention to the paragraph immediately below subsection (5) and argued that

it was indicative of the appellant's agreement.

Nonetheless the learned judge directed that a decree be entered only between the

Plaintiff and 1st and 2nd Defendants. In my view, this indicates that the Commercial High

Court was of the opinion that the parties to the settlement arrangements were the

Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

I hold that the facts and circumstances of this case do not unequivocally establish the

Appellant's consent to the terms of the settlement.

This conclusion is supported by consideration of the proceedings of December 14, 2017.

On this day the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant had informed the

Commercial High Court of its inability to revoke the letter of credit issued at the request

of the Plaintiff in view of the applicable rules. After hearing the parties, the learned judge

of the Commercial High Court declined to change the terms of the regulation.

His order reads:

On 31st October 2017, settlement was recorded between the Plaintiff and the 1st

and 2nd Defendants. The 4th Defendant who was present has also agreed to release

the money deposited against the letter of credit and signed the case record.

Accordingly, the court has already entered the decree. Accordingly, the court holds

that the terms of the settlement already entered in the case cannot be altered at

this stage.

It is significant that the learned judge asserts that the agreement was recorded between

the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants. This is consistent with the journal entry and

order he made on October 31, 2017.

It appears he has taken the view that although not a party to the terms of the settlement,

the Appellant had agreed to release the money deposited against the letter of credit by

signing the case record. He was clearly mistaken because no representative of the

Appellant had signed the case record.

The learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent further submitted that the order made

by the learned judge was not challenged by the Appellant and as such it cannot be done

in the present appeal.

Page 11 of 12

However, it is the clear right of every litigant to invite the Appellate Court to consider on

a final appeal any interlocutory order even if he did not directly challenge it at the time

when it was made [Abubakker v. Ismall Lebbe (11 N.L.R. 309 at 313),

Perera v. Battaglia (58 N.L.R. 447 at 449), Cornel & Company Limited v. Mitsui & Company

Limited and Others (2000) 1 Sri.L.R. 57 at 76].

The Plaintiff-Respondent sought to execute the decree entered in this case against the

Appellant by motion dated 21st February 2018 which was supported in open court on 5th

April 2018. The Appellant objected to this application. Following an inquiry, the learned

judge of the Commercial High Court, by order of August 26, 2019, allowed the application

for execution of the writ against the Appellant. The Appellant preferred this application

against the said order as he is entitled in law.

The learned judge of the Commercial High Court concluded that the Appellant did not

have the right to object to the execution of the writ inter alia, as no appeal was preferred

against the order made on 14th December 2017. However, I find that the Appellant has

the right to challenge the request to enforce the writ against it, taking into account the

above authorities.

The learned judge of the Commercial High Court also rejected the objections of the

Appellant to the execution of the decree on the basis that the settlement was entered

into between the Plaintiff, 1st and 2nd Defendants and Appellant. He was clearly mistaken

as the Appellant was not a party to the terms of the settlement as explained above.

For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the two questions of law in the affirmative and set

aside the order of the learned judge of the Commercial High Court dated August 26, 2019.

In terms of section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code, the decree must be passed in

accordance with such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction as notified to court. In this

case the decree sought to be executed against the Appellant has been entered contrary

to the terms of the settlement and the order made by the learned judge of the

Commercial High Court on October 31, 2017.

Accordingly, I dismiss the application of the Respondent dated 21st February 2018 and

filed on 6th March 2018 in the Commercial High Court marked as P11 to execute a writ

against the Appellant.

Page 12 of 12

For the avoidance of doubt, I hold that the Appellant is not a party to the terms of the

settlement entered on 31st October, 2017.

The Appeal is allowed.

I make no order as to costs.

The Registrar is directed to take further action accordingly.
