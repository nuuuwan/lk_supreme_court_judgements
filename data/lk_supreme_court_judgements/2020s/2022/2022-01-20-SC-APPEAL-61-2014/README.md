The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Monaragala

seeking a declaration that she is the owner of the land described

in the schedule to the plaint on the permit marked P1 issued

under the Land Development Ordinance, and ejectment of the

defendant therefrom. The defendant filed answer seeking

dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration that he is the

owner or possessor of the land. In addition, he prayed that in the

event the court is inclined to grant the reliefs sought by the

plaintiff, the plaintiff be directed to pay him compensation in a

sum of Rs. 1 million for the improvements effected to the land.

After trial the District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs action

predominantly on the basis that the Divisional Secretary had

issued the permit P1 in violation of the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance. On appeal, the High Court set aside the

judgment of the District Court and entered judgment for the

plaintiff but the defendant was allowed to remove the buildings

without causing damage to the land. Hence this appeal by the

defendant to this court. This court granted leave to appeal on the

following questions of law:

4

SC/APPEAL/61/2014

Did the High Court err in law:

(a) when it held that the plaintiff proved she is the permit-

holder;

(b) when it held that the plaintiff had established her rights

pertaining to the land;

(c) when it failed to consider that the plaintiff could not have

been issued a permit as she was just 13 or 14 years of

age at the time;

(d) when it failed to apply the fundamental principles of rei

vindicatio actions in determining the plaintiffs rights

pertaining to the land;

(e) when it held that the defendant was not entitled to any

compensation for the improvements that he had effected

on the land.

The position of the plaintiff is that the original permit issued in

1979 was destroyed when their house was burnt down during the

insurgency in 1988 and the permit P1 is a copy thereof issued by

the Divisional Secretary. P1 issued by the Divisional Secretary,

who is the lawful authority to issue permits under the Land

Development Ordinance, was not marked subject to proof at the

trial. The Land Officer gave evidence confirming the position of

the plaintiff. P1 was not challenged by invoking the writ

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Above all, the Divisional

Secretary is not a party to the case. The case is between the

plaintiff and the defendant. In these circumstances, the District

Judge was wrong to have concluded that the issuance of P1 is

erroneous or P1 is a nullity.

The land in suit is admittedly a state land. The position of the

defendant is that the plaintiffs father sold this land to him in

5

SC/APPEAL/61/2014

1989 by an informal writing marked V1. The plaintiffs father had

no right to sell the land to the defendant. State lands cannot be

sold by individuals. In terms of section 46 of the Land

Development Ordinance, even the permit-holder cannot alienate

the permit land without the written consent of the Divisional

Secretary: such alienations are null and void. Besides, P1 is a

non-notarial document and has no force or avail in law in view of

section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance.

As evident from P3, there had been an inquiry into this dispute

with the participation of both the plaintiff and the defendant, by

the Divisional Secretary in 2000. P1 has been issued in 2001

after the inquiry.

P4 inter alia goes to show that the defendant has made at least

some improvements to the land despite the Divisional Secretarys

warning not to effect improvements until the dispute was settled.

He effected the improvements at his own risk. There is no evidence

that the defendant attempted to obtain a permit for the land. This

may be because he knew that a permit had already been issued

in respect of the land.

Only bona fide possessors are entitled to compensation for useful

improvements and the ius retentionis (right of retention) is

available to them until compensation is paid by the owner. Even

if the defendant is a bona fide possessor, the plaintiff does not

want the buildings on the land perhaps because she does not

have the financial capacity to pay compensation. The buildings

cannot be thrust upon her and she cannot be compelled to pay

compensation to the defendant. The High Court allowed the

defendant to remove the buildings. The ius tollendi (right to

6

SC/APPEAL/61/2014

remove improvements) is available to the improver when

compensation cannot be awarded.

The defendant does not have a permit; only the plaintiff has one

issued by the Divisional Secretary. The contention of learned

counsel for the defendant is that in a rei vindicatio action the

plaintiff shall prove title as pleaded in the plaint and the plaintiff

in this case did not prove that P1 is a copy of the original permit.

What the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove is that he

was the owner of the land at the time of filing the action and

continues to be so until judgment is entered in his favour. In my

view the plaintiff has discharged her burden.

As I held in Wasantha v. Premawathie (SC/APPEAL/176/2014,

SC Minutes of 17.05.2021), there is no necessity to interpret the

law with excessive stringency against the plaintiff in a rei

vindicatio action and if the plaintiff proves on a balance of

probabilities that he has sufficient title or superior title to that

of the defendant, the plaintiff shall succeed.

Learned counsel for the defendant submits that it was erroneous

on the part of the learned High Court judges to have considered

the defendants case in entering judgment in favour of the plaintiff

because in a rei vindicatio action the defendant need not prove

anything and the burden lies fairly and squarely on the plaintiff

to prove title to the land. As I held in Wasantha v. Premawathie

(supra):

Notwithstanding that in a rei vindicatio action the burden is

on the plaintiff to prove title to the land no matter how fragile

the case of the defendant is, the court is not debarred from

taking into consideration the evidence of the defendant in

7

SC/APPEAL/61/2014

deciding whether or not the plaintiff has proved his title. Not

only is the court not debarred from doing so, it is in fact the

duty of the court to give due regard to the defendants case,

for otherwise there is no purpose in a rei vindicatio action in

allowing the defendant to lead evidence when all he seeks is

for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

Moreover, in the instant case, the plaintiff sought a declaration

that he is the owner of the land on P1. The defendant countersued

for a declaration that the defendant is the owner of the land. In

such circumstances, is the court not entitled to look at the

competing claims of both parties to decide who the owner of the

land is? The court eminently is.

In my view there is no reason to interfere with the judgment of the

High Court. I answer the questions of law in the negative and

dismiss the appeal but without costs.
