Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Applicant - Appellant - Respondent (herein after referred to as The Applicant) made four

applications on behalf of its four members against the Respondent Respondent Appellant

(herein after referred to as The Respondent) to the Labour Tribunal of Colombo alleging that the

services of its members had been illegally and unjustifiably terminated by the Respondent Company.

In the said applications, the Applicant prayed that the members whom the Applicant had

represented before the Labour Tribunal be reinstated with back wages by the Respondent or be

granted compensation in lieu of reinstatement and any other relief that the Tribunal may seem

meet.

The Respondent whilst filing the answers before the Labour Tribunal, took up the position that the

termination of the services of the said employees were due to serious act of misconduct which were

established after a formal domestic inquiry. The Respondent stated further, that the said

termination on the part of them, was lawful and justifiable and prayed, the applications be

dismissed.

All four applications were heard together and after the trial, the Labour Tribunal by its Order dated

30th January 2015 held that two of the said employees have not been proven guilty for the charges

made against them, and the other two has directly participated with the incident of assault and

thereby committed an act of grave misconduct. However, the Labour Tribunal concluded that the

termination of the services of all four employees were just and equitable, and no one has been

compensated.

4 Being aggrieved by the said Orders of the Labour Tribunal, the Applicant appealed to the High Court

of Western Province holden in Colombo, and by the Judgment dated 5th of June 2017, the learned

Judge of the High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo, allowed the appeal by setting aside

the Order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and ordered a re-trial before the Labour

Tribunal.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment delivered by the High Court, the Respondent preferred the

Petition of Appeal dated 14th July 2017 seeking Special Leave from the Supreme Court. The Supreme

Court having considered the submissions made on behalf of the Respondent on 02nd October 2017,

granted Special Leave on the question of law set out in sub paragraphs (a) to (f) of paragraph 14 of

the said Petition, which states as follows;

(a) Whether the Honourable Judges of the High Court entitled to reverse or set aside the order

of the President of the Labour Tribunal and to order a re-trial on the basis of the alleged

contradictions when the oral and documentary evidence on record clearly prove and

establish that the Applicants have assaulted Josheph Benedict Fernando, Public Relations

Officer of the Respondent?

(b) Whether the Respondent has in law justified the basis of the termination of the contract of

employment of the Applicants before the Labour Tribunal on a balance of probability or on

a preponderance of evidence?

(c) Whether the Honourable Judge of the High Court has erred in law in ordering a re-trial when

the Respondent has duly discharged the burden in proving and justifying the termination on

balance of probability or on a preponderance of evidence?

(d) Without having any legal basis, did the learned High Court Judge err in law and in fact in

holding that the President of the Labour Tribunal has failed to analyze the oral and

documentary evidence placed before him?

(e) This the Learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to take into consideration the legal

principle enunciated in the case of The Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber Estates Ltd. Vs.

J. S Hillman 79 (1) NLR 421, Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Ltd. Vs. United

Engineers Workers Union 77 NLR 541, Hemas (Estates) Ltd. & Another vs. Ceylon Workers

Congress 76 NLR 59, and thereby further err in ordering a re-trial?

5

(f) Whether the Honourable Judge of the High Court erred in holding that two employees out

of several employees involved in an assault incident cannot be found guilty due to the lack

of evidence against the other accused employees?

Subsequent to the filing of the instant Special Leave to Appeal Application before the Supreme

Court, on several occasions prior and after the granting of Special Leave, notices were issued on the

Applicant Union to appear before this Court but the said Union defaulted its duty to represent the

employees. As observed by me the Court had issued notice on the Applicant Union on 7 occasions

under Registered Post and finally taken up for hearing since the Applicant had not appear before

this Court from the time the Special Leave to Appeal Application was filed.

However, this Court is mindful of this fact as well as its responsibility to pronounce a just and

equitable order in this case.

Before moving on to the questions of law, on which the leave was granted, it is important to refer

briefly to the factual Matrix of this case to have a better understanding of the two contradictory

views taken by the Labour Tribunal and the High Court when disposing the cases heard before them.

The Applicant, Inter Company Trade Union, has filed four separate applications in the Labour

Tribunal on behalf of the four employees of the Respondent Company Trico Maritime (Pvt.) Ltd,

namely Yakupiti Senevirathne De Silva, Kudagama Liyanage Kapila Udayanga, Muruthagahapitiya

Ralalage Sunil Bandara and Heenpatilage Wimal Premarathne alleging that the termination of their

services was unreasonable and unjustifiable.

In the answers filed before the Labour Tribunal, the Respondent whilst admitting the termination,

had taken up the position that the said termination was both lawful and justifiable. It was the

position taken by the Respondent, that the termination of the services of the four employees was

due to the assault of its Public Relations Officer namely Josheph Benedict Fernando at the Hotel

Brighton Rest, where the Annual General Meeting of the Welfare Society was held. According to

the Respondents, after the said incident having recorded the statements of the four employees,

they were interdicted without pay with effect from 18th November 2010 and a charge sheet was

served on them by registered post, calling for their written explanations. Since their explanation

were found unsatisfactory and unacceptable, a domestic inquiry by an outside and independent

inquiry officer was held and the said employees had been found guilty by the inquirer.

6 The four applications before the Labour Tribunal were consolidated with the consent of the parties

and had taken up as one trial.

At the trial before the Labour Tribunal, Josheph Benedict Fernando (Public Relations Officer) and

Gamage Nishantha Cooray who was an eyewitness gave evidence with regard to the alleged incident

of assault. Sidath Mahendra Nagahawatte (Manager, Security Services of the Mobitel), Mrs. Roshini

Dilrukshi (Human Resources Officer), Kasun Thivanka Mallawarachchi (Networking Officer),

Arachchige Dinesh Priyantha Salgado (Manager, Human Resources) were also called to give

evidence and the documents marked as R1 to R8, X, X1 and Y were produced on behalf

of the Respondent.

On behalf of the Applicant, Muruthagahapitiya Ralalage Sunil Bandara and Yakupiti Senevirathne De

Silva gave evidence marking the document A1. Although the Applicants have admitted that they

participated the event, the alleged assault was denied by them.

At the conclusion of the trial before the Labour Tribunal, the President, whilst concluding that there

was evidence of assault on J. B. Fernando, observed further, that the said evidence was insufficient

to establish the assault by two employees namely Kapila Udayanga and Wimal Premarathne who

were also represented by the Applicant before the Labour Tribunal.

The President of the Labour Tribunal had observed an inconsistency between the evidence of

Josheph Benedict Fernando and Nishantha Cooray with regard to the assault as follows;

7 but dismissed the Applications filed before the Labour Tribunal on behalf of the said employees for

different reasons.

The Superior Courts, when exercising its Appellate powers, are reluctant to interfere with the

findings of a Labour Tribunal based on the evidence led before the Tribunal, except acting under

Section 31D (3) of the Industrial Disputes Act 43 of 1950 (as amended) on a question of Law.

However, in the case of Ceylon Transport Board Vs. N. M. J. Abdeen 70 NLR 407, this Court held

that,

Where the President of a Labour Tribunal misdirects himself on the facts, such misdirection

amounts to a question of law within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act.

In the case of Ceylon Transport Board Vs. W. A. D. Gunasinghe 72 NLR 76, it was further held that,

Where a Labour Tribunal makes a finding of fact for which there is no evidence-a finding

which is both inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it-the restrictions of the

right of the Supreme Court to review questions of law does not prevent it from examining

and interfering with the Order based on such findings if the Labour Tribunal is under a duty

to act judicially.

As observed by this Court, the dismissal of four employees on alleged misconduct, was the subject

matter before the Labour Tribunal and was entirely based on an incident of assault by four

employees of the Respondent Company on an officer of the same Company. The officer who was

assaulted namely J. B. Fernando, in his evidence before the Labour Tribunal had identified those

who assaulted him as follows;

The said complaint had been produced at the trial marked R-2.

In his evidence before the Labour Tribunal, witness Nishantha Cooray had referred to the incident

that took places on the day in question and said that witness Fernando had accompanied him to the

2nd floor in order to show the Bar to him and at that time witness Fernando was assaulted by some

employees. He identified Applicants Bandara and Senevirathne along with another person

assaulting the victim but not seen Kapila and Pemarathne assaulting the victim but they were with

the others at that time. He too was hit with a bottle thrown by Senevirathne and he had to bend

holding to his face at that time.

That was the only evidence led before the Labour Tribunal with regard to the incident and witness

Fernando in his evidence had clearly implicated all 4 Applicants assaulting him along with another

person and the 1st Complaint made by him to the Police was marked as R-1 during his evidence. No

contradictions were marked with his police statement during the cross examination. Even though

witness Cooray had not seen Premarathne and Kapila Assaulting the victim he had seen them with

the other three, who assaulted the victim but at one stage he had to bend holding to his face since

a bottle which was thrown by Senevirathne hit his head.

In the case of Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Ltd Vs. United Engineering Workers

Union 77 NLR 541, it was held that,

Where in an inquiry before a Labour Tribunal it was alleged that the reason for the

termination of employment was that the workman was guilty of a criminal act involving

moral turpitude, the allegation need not be established by proof beyond reasonable doubt

9

as in a criminal case. Such an allegation has to be decided on a balance of probability, every

element of the gravity of the charge becoming a part of the whole range of circumstances,

which are weighed in the balance, as in every other civil proceeding

In the case of Hemas (Estates) Ltd Vs. Ceylon WorkersCongress 76 NLR 59, Sirimane (J) has

observed the burden of proof before the Labour Tribunal as,

In proceedings before a Labour Tribunal relating to a dispute between a workman and his

employer, it is open to the President to accept the more probable version and to decide the

case on a balance of probability

It was also held in the case of The Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber Estates ltd. Vs. J. S. Hillman

79 NLR 421,

That on allegation of misconduct in proceedings before Labour Tribunal has to be decided

on a balance of probability it is not necessary to call for proof beyond reasonable doubt as

in a criminal case.

In the said circumstance it is clear, that the standard of proof before Labour Tribunal had been

considered by this Court as the more probable version of evidence which can be identified in order

to ascertain the termination of the employment is reasonable or not. The required proof is not

beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case but it is on a balance of probability.

As revealed before this Court, witnesses Fernando and Cooray were the eyewitnesses and their

evidence can be used to identify the incident of assault to the Officer J.B. Fernando and therefore,

the Tribunal should consider the evidence on the standard of balance of probability to come to a

reasonable conclusion, or to have a just and equitable Order. It does not need to have more

witnesses to prove this. Even the evidence of one witness is sufficient to reach a reasonable

conclusion on probabilities if the evidence of the said witness is reliable.

Vythiylingam (J) had observed in the case of Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Ltd vs.

United Engineering Workers Union (supra),

. The reason for the termination was connected with the conduct of the workman. The

issue before the Tribunal in this case was whether having regard to all the facts and

circumstances of the case the termination of the employment of the workman was justified

or not, and not simply whether the workman was guilty of theft of the boots or not

10 It was held further,

In the instant case the Tribunal had to find as a fact whether the workman did commit theft

of the boots or not, but this was only incidental to the decision as to whether the termination

of the employment was justified or not and not for the purpose of punishing him for a

criminal offence. It has been emphasized in a number of cases that the proceedings before

a Labour Tribunal are not criminal in nature and therefore the standards of proof required

to establish a criminal charge are wholly inappropriate where the Tribunal has merely to

ascertain the facts and make an order which in all the circumstances of the case is just and

equitable. In doing so the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence contained in the

Evidence Ordinance and may base its decisions on evidence which would be shut out from

the ordinary courts of law

In the said circumstances, it is clear that the President of the Labour Tribunal had misdirected

himself when analyzing the evidence of the eye witnesses and had come to a wrong conclusion with

regard to the act of misconduct committed by two employees namely, Kapila Udayanga and

Wimal Premarathne

However, when the order of the Labour Tribunal was appealed to the High Court, the High Court

had failed to observe the above misdirection on the part of the President of the Labour Tribunal,

but also misdirected with regard to the burden of proof required before the Labour Tribunal.

In his order the learned High Court Judge had observed;

11 In the said circumstances, it is clear that the said finding of the High Court is erroneous and the

Judges of the High Court misdirected themselves when they expected the Respondent to prove the

case against the Applicants beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore answer the questions of law on

which the leave had been granted by this Court in favour of the Respondent.

As already referred to in this Judgment the Labour Tribunal had dismissed the application filed by

the Applicant on behalf of all four employees for different reasons, even though the Tribunal had

no legal basis to come to the said finding. However, the finding of the Labour Tribunal to dismiss all

four applications which were taken up before the Labour Tribunal as one trial, with the consent of

all parties, can be justified for the reasons already referred to in this judgment.

I therefore allow the appeal and affirm the order of the Labour Tribunal dated 30. 01. 2015 for the

reasons elucidate in my Judgment.

Appeal allowed.

No cost.
