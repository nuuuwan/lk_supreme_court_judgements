DECIDED ON: 27.10.2022 K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J. The 3rd Accused- Appellant- Appellant Company (hereinafter referred to as

the “Appellant”) engages in manufacturing and bottling of carbonated

drinks. In this appeal, the Appellant seeks to set aside the Judgment

delivered by the High Court of Kurunegala which affirmed the Judgment and

Sentencing Order of the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala.

By application dated 14.12.2018, the Appellant sought Special Leave to

Appeal from the Supreme Court to set aside and/ or vary the Provincial High

Court Judgment.

Having heard submissions of both Counsel, this Court was inclined to grant

Special Leave to Appeal on the following question of law;

“Has the learned High Court Judge erred in Law by failing to consider

the objection of the Accused that the action had been instituted against

them by the Complainant after the lapse of 3 months from the detection

of the alleged offence in contravention of the provisions in Section

20(1)(b) of the Food Act as amended?”

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Accused were respectively charged in the Magistrate’s

Court of Kurunegala under Section 2(1)(b) of the Food Act, No. 26 of 1980

read with Section 2 (1) (a) of the Food (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 1991 for

having sold, distributed and manufactured Fanta Cream Soda unfit for

human consumption with impurities. The said bottle was purchased by one

Abeysuriya on 10.02.2011. However, he had lodged a complaint to the

Public Health Inspector only on 24.05.2011, after a lapse of 3 months from

the date of purchasing the bottle.

5

By way of original Charge Sheet dated 27.05.2011, the prosecution was

instituted against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Accused. By way of an amended

Charge Sheet dated 09.12.2011, the charges against the accused were

altered to having sold, distributed and manufactured Fanta Cream Soda

unfit for human consumption with an impurity consisting of black spots &

white substance. After the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges, the

case proceeded to trial.

At the conclusion of the trial, the 3rd Accused tendered written submissions,

after which a date was fixed for the pronouncement of the judgment. This

date was subsequently postponed several times. The court had thereafter,

on its own accord, caused to summon the Additional Approved Analyst to

lead evidence for the prosecution, overruling the objections of the Accused.

On 15.09.2017, the Learned Magistrate acquitted the 2nd accused and

convicted the 1st and 3rd accused. Thereafter imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000/-

each on the 1st and 3rd accused. Aggrieved by the Judgment and Sentence,

the 1st and 3rd accused preferred an appeal to the High Court of the North-

Western Province holden in Kurunegala, which dismissed the appeal while

affirming the Judgment of the Magistrate Court.

The Appellant has now preferred the instant appeal to the Supreme Court

seeking to set aside the Judgment of the High Court dated 12.11.2018 and

the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate dated

15.09.2017.

The 3rd Accused- Appellant- Appellant was charged with committing an

offence under Section 2(1)(b) of the Food Act read together with Section

2(1)(a) of the Food (Amendment) Act for having manufactured, on or about

18.01.2011, Fanta Cream Soda with an impurity, an offence punishable

under Section 18(1)(a) of the Act read with Section 14(1)(a) of the

amendment.

6

Section 2(1)(b) of the Food Act, as amended by Act No. 20 of 1991, is as

follows:

No person shall manufacture, import, sell, expose for sale, store or

distribute any food that is unfit for human consumption;

Section 18(1)(a) of the Food Act, as amended, imposes penalties for

contravening the provisions of the Act.

Now I will proceed to address the question of law based on which leave to

appeal was granted. It is the contention of the Appellant Company that the

prosecution which was instituted by the Complainant is statutorily time

barred in terms of Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act.

Section 20 (1) of the Food Act, as amended, is reproduced as follows:

20. (1) A prosecution for an offence under this Act or any regulations made

thereunder shall not be instituted-

a) except by an Authorized Officer; and

b) after the expiration of three months, from the date of detection of

that offence or where sampling is done, from the date of sampling;

It is evident that Section 20 (1) (b) prescribes a time bar in relation to

instituting a prosecution for any offence committed under the Food Act.

There are two distinct strands of authority relating to the issue whether the

non-adherence with this statutory time bar should, by itself, be held against

a prosecution instituted by the State.

The first line of authority is based on the common law principle nullum

tempus occurrit regi, which means, ‘no time runs against the King’. The

maxim purports to exempt the State from instituting prosecution for an

offence despite the period of limitation, and is inconceivably based on the

7

general rule of criminal justice that crime never dies. On the other hand,

arguments have also been instituted based on the maxim vigilantibus et non

dormientibus, jura subveniunt, which means, ‘the law assists the vigilant and

not the sleepy’.

There are several judicial pronouncements which observe that, given that

the object of criminal law is to punish perpetrators of crime, Courts should

not dismiss the prosecution solely on the ground of a delay in instituting the

action.

In Raja Nanayakkara vs. Mercy Jayasinghe and Others [2004 2 Sri

L.R. 416], the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka observed that:

“Section 9 of the Prescription Ordinance speaks of “within two years

from the time when the cause of action shall have arisen”. It appears

that the word “from” means that the computation of the two year period

commences after excluding the day on which the cause of action

accrued.”

It is evident from the abovementioned case that the amount of time for

prescription commences “from” the day the cause of action arose which is

the date of purchase of the Fanta Cream Soda Bottle.

In Attorney General vs. Wilson and others [1997 2 Sri L.R. 349], the

Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka observed that:

“We can thus conclude that the position of the Crown in regard to

limitations is that in so far as prescription is claimed against the Crown

in actions instituted by it, there is no principle of law upon the basis of

which immunity from prescription may be claimed by the Crown, where

its inalienable rights are not involved”. In the present case the Attorney

General has on behalf of the State sought to recover damages six and a

half years after the alleged cause of action had arisen. This claim for

8

damages by the State is prescribed after the lapse of a period of three

years according to the Roman Dutch Law.”

An obvious conclusion can be drawn from the abovementioned case that the

time bar contained in section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act applies to all actions

including actions instituted by the crown and therefore the action is

prescribed.

In Japani Sahoo vs. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty [AIR 2007 SC 2762], the

Supreme Court of India observed that:

“The general rule of criminal justice is that “a crime never dies”. The

principle is reflected in the well- known maxim nullum tempus aut locus

occurrit regi (lapse of time is no bar to Crown in proceeding against

offenders)… It is settled law that a criminal offence is considered as a

wrong against the State and the Society even though it has been

committed against an individual. Normally, in serious offences,

prosecution is launched by the State and a Court of Law has no power

to throw away prosecution solely on the ground of delay. Mere delay in

approaching a Court of Law would not by itself afford a ground for

dismissing the case though it may be a relevant circumstance in

reaching a final verdict.”

The Supreme Court of India also adopted this opinion in Assistant

Collector of Customs vs. U.L.R. Malwani and another [AIR 1970 SC

962], where it was held that:

“The question of delay in filing a complaint may be a circumstance to be

taken into consideration in arriving at the final verdict. But by itself it

affords no ground for dismissing the complaint. Hence we see no

substance in the contention that the prosecution should be quashed on

the ground that there, was delay in instituting the complaint.”

9

Conversely, in the aforementioned Japani Sahoo judgment (supra), the

Court extensively discussed arguments in favour of prescribing periods of

limitation for criminal prosecutions. Among the justifications set out by the

Court are that such periods of limitation would prevent the prosecution

story being doubted due to uncertainty of evidence caused by inordinate

delay, that it would be in accordance with the sense of social retribution

which would otherwise be adversely affected by the delay, and that it would

serve the wider interest of administration of criminal justice in pressuring

the organs of State in ensuring the quick detection and punishment of the

crime.

In the Indian Judgment of State of Punjab v. Sarwan Singh, [AIR 1981

SC 1054] the Supreme Court, while observing the implications of setting out

a period of limitation in the provisions of its Criminal Procedure Code, held

that;

“The object of the Criminal Procedure Code in putting a bar of limitation

on prosecutions was clearly to prevent the parties from filing cases after

a long time, as a result of which material evidence may disappear and

also to prevent abuse of the process of the court by filing vexatious and

belated prosecutions long after the date of the offence. The object which

the statutes seek to subserve is clearly in consonance with the concept

of fairness of trial as enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. It

is, therefore, of the utmost importance that any prosecution, whether by

the State or a private complainant must abide by the letter of law or

take the risk of the prosecution failing on the ground of limitation.”

Prior to analyzing the arguments of the instant case, it is also pertinent to

briefly touch on Section 473 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India

(1973) for contextual purposes. The section provides for an extension of the

period of limitation in certain cases, and reads as follows:

10

Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this

Chapter, any Court may make cognizance of an offence after the expiry

of the period of limitations, if it is satisfied on the facts and in the

circumstances of the case that the delay has been properly explained or

that it is necessary so to do in the interests of justice.

However, it must be noted herein that no equivalent provision to the

abovementioned section exists within the law of Sri Lanka. Section 456 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 merely stipulates a

generally applicable statutory bar on the right of the prosecution for crimes

or offences.

Section 456 is as follows:

The right of prosecution for murder or treason shall not be barred by

any length of time, but the right of prosecution for any other crime or

offence (save and except those as to which special provision is or shall

be made by law) shall be barred by the lapse of twenty years from the

time when the crime or offence shall have been committed.

Accordingly, it is now evident that Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act is a

special provision which falls within the aforementioned exception, as it

expressly provides for a time limit within which a prosecution for an offence

committed under the Act ought to be instituted. Therefore, the statutory

time bars set out in Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act and Section 456 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure ought to be interpreted in light of the object of

Article 13 (3) of our Constitution, which guarantees to every person the

fundamental right to a fair trial.

Having stated these considerations, I will now proceed to determine, with

reference to the facts and circumstances of this case, whether the

prosecution was actually instituted within the statutorily mandated time

period.

11

The Fanta Cream Soda bottle in question was purchased by one Abeysuriya

on 10.02.2011. However, he had lodged a complaint to the Public Health

Inspector only on 24.05.2011, which, by itself, is after a lapse of over 3

months from the date of purchasing the bottle. Thereafter, the charge sheet

was filed and prosecution was instituted against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Accused

on 27.05.2011. Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act requires a prosecution for

an offence under the Act to be instituted no more than 3 months from the

date of detection of the offence. (වරද අනාවරණය කර ගත් දිනයේ සිට, or, as

stated in the Amendment, වරද අල්ලාගත් දිනයේ සිට)

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the actual point of

detection for purposes of Section 20 (1) is from the date when the virtual

complainant himself detects or discovers the commission of the alleged

offence, and not from the date of complaint to the Authorized Officer.

Therefore, it is submitted that, as the offence was detected on 10.02.2011,

and as the prosecution was instituted only after the lapse of 3 months from

the said date (that is, on 27.05.2011), the action ought to be statutorily time

barred under Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act.

On the other hand, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents contends that the action against the Appellant was instituted

well within the stipulated time. The central argument of the Respondents is

that the word ‘detection’ as used in Section 20 of the Food Act has been

used with a specific meaning to it, i.e., the detection of an offence by law

enforcement officials and/or for law enforcement purposes. Therefore, it is the

submission of the Respondents that the point of detection should not be

10.02.2011, but instead be the date on which the complaint was received by

the Authorized Officer, that is, 24.05.2011.

The Respondents also buttress this point stating that, in the same manner

as Section 20 requires a prosecution to be conducted by an ‘Authorized

Officer’, the detection of the offence too ought to be done by a similar

12

Authorized Officer. As Abeysuriya, who purchased the bottle of Fanta Cream

Soda, could not be considered an Authorized Officer under the Food Act, it

cannot be said that the offence was detected by him. Therefore, it is claimed

that the date of detection is the date of receiving the complaint.

The Oxford English Reference Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 1995)

sets out the definition of the word “detection” as follows:

1a- the act or an instance of detecting: the process of being detected.

b- an instance of this.

Furthermore, the word “detect”, is defined as:

1a- to reveal the guilt of: discover

b-discover (a crime)

2- discover or perceive the existence or presence of

It is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation, that if the language used by

the Legislature is clear and unambiguous, a court of law has only to

expound the words in their natural and ordinary sense. The same is

espoused in the legal maxim verbis plane expressis amnino standum est. In

the landmark case of Nokes vs. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries

[1940] AC 1014 the Lord Chancellor Viscount Simon held that “[T]he golden

rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary

meaning.”

Furthermore, in the Sussex Peerage Case [1844] 8 ER 1034 Lord Tindal

observed that

“The rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is that they should

be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the

Act. If the words of the statute are of themselves precise and

unambiguous, then no more can be necessary then to expound those

13

words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves do, in

such case, best declare the intention of the Legislature.”

N. S. Bindra’s Interpretation of Statutes (8th Edition, 1997) explains at page

435 on the ordinary and natural meaning of words to be adhered to in the

first instance:

In construing a statutory provision, the first and foremost rule of

construction is the literary construction… If the provision is

unambiguous and if from that provision, the legislative intent is clear,

we need not call into aid the other rules of construction of statutes. The

other rules of construction of statutes are called into aid only when the

legislative intention is not clear.

In the context of these authorities, it is my view that the argument of the

Respondents in giving an unnaturally broader meaning to the phrase

‘detection of an offence’ under Section 20 so as to construe detection being

done by law enforcement officials and/or for law enforcement purposes,

would create unnecessary confusion and be antithetical to the intention of

Parliament. It would certainly be in conflict with the Legislative intent

behind prescribing a period of limitation for criminal prosecutions instituted

under the Food Act. Furthermore, it would divert from the object of the

judiciary to construe a word which is precise and unambiguous in its

natural and ordinary meaning.

In the judgment of L. H. M. B. B. Herath, Chief Manager Welfare and

Industrial Relations, Sri Lanka Ports Authority vs. Morgan

Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd. (S C Appeal No. 214/2012 decided on 27th June

2013) at page 6 His Lordship Justice Sripavan (as His Lordship was then),

when interpreting the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, observed as follows:

14

“If the language of the enactment is clear and unambiguous, it would

not be legitimate for the Courts to add words by implication into the

language. It is a settled law of interpretation that the words are to be

interpreted as they appear in the provision, simple and grammatical

meaning is to be given to them, and nothing can be added or

subtracted.”

It is well-known that the primary duty of the Court is to give effect to the

intention of the Legislature as expressed by the words of a statute. When the

statutory language shows no ambiguity or confusion, it would be unwise for

the Court to impart its own gloss on it so as to accord it some meaning

contrary to that set out in the language of the law. For this reason, I hold

that the Respondents’ argument on the interpretation of Section 20 (1) (b) of

the Food Act holds no merits.

It is contended that the intention of the Legislature by imposing a time bar

as contained in Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act for instituting an action

was to ensure inter alia credibility of the Complainant, as it is with the

expectation that a Complainant will initiate an action by bringing the offence

to the notice of the relevant Officers at the earliest point of discovery that the

offence had taken place. The fact that the Complainant in this case waited

for a period of an excess of 3 months from the date of detection before

lodging the complaint to the Public Health Inspector can create a doubt in

the prosecution.

As a period of three months had lapsed since the date of detection of the

offence, I hold that the prosecution is time barred under the provisions of

Section 20 (1) (b) of the Food Act. Accordingly, I hold that the substantive

question on which leave to appeal has been granted by this Court should be

answered in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant.

Section 20 is a provision in the Food Act which requires mandatory

compliance, and the failure of the Respondents to adhere to its provisions

15

had caused a procedural irregularity which has violated the right of the 3rd

Accused- Appellant- Appellant to a fair trial.

For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed and hold that the 3rd

Accused- Appellant- Appellant be acquitted and discharged. Accordingly, the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the 3rd Accused- Appellant-

Appellant in the Magistrates Court of Kurunegala dated 15.09.2017 and the

judgment of the High Court of Kurunegala dated 12.11.2018 are hereby set

aside. This Court does not make an order for costs in the circumstances of

this case.
