The said plaint was amended thrice, and by the final amended plaint dated 02.02.2001, the Plaintiff inter alia prayed for a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule \u2018A\u2019, for the ejectment of the Defendant and others claiming under him from the land described in the schedule \u2018C\u2019 to the plaint and for damages. However, the position of the Plaintiff is that this prayer for declaration of title to the land described in schedule \u2018A\u2019 to the final amended plaint was an obvious oversight- vide her written submissions dated 13.11.2014. As per the paragraphs 6,7 and 10 of her final amended plaint, in fact she has claimed a declaration of title to the land described in schedule \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 to the amended plaint and land described in \u2018C\u2019 has been described as a part of land described in schedule \u2018B\u2019 to the plaint. The land in schedule \u2018B\u201d has been described as a separated portion of the land in schedule \u2018A\u2019 of the said amended plaint with the consent of other co-owners, from the latter part of 1964.",

Thus, other co-owners are not bound by the said judgment. In the last amended plaint, the Plaintiff has averred that he was a co-owner to the land described in the schedule A to the plaint and got the land described in the schedule B to the plaint separated in lieu of his entitlement to the share in land described in the schedule A and became the owner of that portion of the land described in the schedule B of the plaint and the Defendant is in unlawful and forcible possession of the land described in the schedule C of the plaint which is a portion of the land described in the schedule B to the plaint. The Plaintiff has even claimed exclusive title by prescription to the said separated portion of land described in the schedule B to the plaint. The alleged cause of action is based on violation of his rights emanating from his title to the land described in the said schedule B to the plaint by the said encroachment triggering his entitlement for a declaration of title to said portion of land described in schedule B to the plaint and eviction of the defendant from the land described in schedule C to the plaint with damages claimed in the plaint- vide paragraphs 2 to 10 of the amended plaint dated",

Thus, it appears that the prayer no. 1 for a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule A to the plaint is a mistake as the body of the plaint contains a cause of action based on the Plaintiff\u2019s sole title to the land described in the schedule B to the plaint. However, I do not think this mistake itself is sufficient to dismiss the Plaintiff\u2019s action since, if there is an error in the prayer no.1, the Court may decline to grant relief under prayer no.1 and consider the possibility of granting relief in prayer no.2 to 4 if the cause of action is proved. Further, as decided in the cases Dharmasiri V Wickrematunga (2002) 2 Sri. L. R 218 and Jayasinghe V Tikiri Banda (1988) 2 CALR 24, in a declaration of title action, absence of a prayer for declaration of title does not prevent the relief of ejectment, if in the body of the plaint title is pleaded and issues were framed and accepted by the court accordingly, and the title of the plaintiff is proved. Thus, in a declaration of title and ejectment case or in a rei vindicatio action what is necessary is to prove title to the disputed portion of land and its unlawful possession by the Defendant. Therefore, in the case at hand, to grant reliefs under prayers no 2 to 4, it is sufficient to prove title to the land in schedule B to the plaint and the unlawful possession of the Defendant in the portion of land in schedule C to the plaint which is a portion of land in schedule B to the plaint along with the damages caused, even if it is assumed that there is an error in the prayer no.1 when it is read with the body of the plaint. However, learned District judge has not granted damages prayed for as no assessment of damages was placed before the District Court.",

Even the Plaintiff while giving evidence has admitted there are other co-owners.

However, the said Harriet V Pathmasiri can be distinguished from this irrespective of the other reasons given in that decision since the termination of license was not proved, the cause of action based on unlawful possession as a trespasser could not have been succeeded. With regard to the other reasons stated in that decision, I observe that it has not been considered in that decision the entitlement of a plaintiff to get a lesser relief than what he has prayed for in the plaint- see Allis V Seneviratne and Others (1989) 2 Sri L R 335.
