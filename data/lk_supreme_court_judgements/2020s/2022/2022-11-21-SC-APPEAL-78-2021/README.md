Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the two defendants in the District

Court of Bandarawela seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 200,000.00 with

interest lent to the mother of the defendants on a Mortgage Bond given as

security. Although summons was duly served on the defendants, on their

failure to file answer, the District Court fixed the case for ex parte trial in

terms of section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code. A few days later, an oral

application was made to the District Court seeking that the answer be

accepted in terms of section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. This has

rightly been refused by the District Court as there is a clear provision

under section 86 of the Civil Procedure Code to cater to this situation. Ex

parte trial was concluded by affidavit evidence and, having considered the

evidence, the District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s action. The plaintiff

appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Badulla against the

4

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

judgment. The 1st defendant appeared in person before the High Court. By

judgment dated 16.12.2020 the High Court set aside the judgment of the

District Court and directed the District Court to enter judgment for the

plaintiff. It is against this judgment of the High Court that the 1st

defendant has filed this leave to appeal application.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff takes up a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of this application on the basis that without the 1st

defendant first purging her default in the District Court under section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code she cannot come before this Court

against the judgment of the High Court.

Learned counsel for the 1st defendant referring to section 88(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code, which states that an appeal does not lie against any

judgment entered upon default, contends that once the District Court

dismisses the plaintiff’s action, the judgment ceases to be a judgment as

contemplated under section 88(1) and the question of purging default does

not arise and therefore the 1st defendant can prefer an appeal to this Court

against the judgment of the High Court. Learned counsel further contends

that in any event section 86(2), which allows a window of opportunity for

a defendant to purge default, cannot be availed of by the 1st defendant in

view of section 59 of the Mortgage Act No. 6 of 1949 since that provision

is inapplicable to a defendant in a hypothecary action. Hence it is

submitted that this Court shall entertain this leave to appeal application

under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code or by application of the rules

of natural justice.

In terms of section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code, the District Court can

fix ex parte trial against a defendant on two occasions: (a) failure to file the

answer; and (b) failure to appear on the date of the hearing of the action.

The defendant need not appear in person on the trial date and can be

represented by an Attorney-at-Law, which is sufficient compliance with

5

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

section 84. In this case the 1st defendant’s failure to file answer triggered

the application of this section. Section 84 reads as follows: “If the

defendant fails to file his answer on or before the day fixed for the filing of

the answer, or on or before the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the

answer or having filed his answer, if he fails to appear on the day fixed for

the hearing of the action, and if the court is satisfied that the defendant has

been duly served with summons, or has received due notice of the day fixed

for the subsequent filing of the answer, or of the day fixed for the hearing of

the action, as the case may be, and if, on the occasion of such default of the

defendant, the plaintiff appears, then the court shall proceed to hear the

case ex parte forthwith, or on such other day as the court may fix.”

How a defendant may purge default is set out in section 86 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Two opportunities are available to the defendant: (a)

before entering the judgment, the Court can purge the default with the

consent of the plaintiff; and (b) after entering the judgment, the defendant

can make an application to Court to purge the default within 14 days of

service of the ex parte decree. Section 86(2) reads as follows: “Where,

within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered against him for

default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes application to and

thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable grounds for such default,

the court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant

to proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as

to costs or otherwise as to the court shall appear proper.” Section 86(2A)

states “At any time prior to the entering of judgment against a defendant for

default, the court may, if the plaintiff consents, but not otherwise, set aside

any order made on the basis of the default of the defendant and permit him

to proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as

to costs or otherwise as to the court shall appear fit.” According to section

86(3) “Every application under this section shall be made by petition

supported by affidavit.”

6

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

In terms of section 87(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, the failure on the

part of the plaintiff to appear before Court on the trial date warrants

dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. This does not mean that the plaintiff

shall be physically present on the trial date. He can be represented by an

Attorney-at-Law and that is sufficient compliance with section 87(1).

If the Court dismisses the plaintiff’s action in terms of section 87(1) when

the defendant is present and there is a claim in reconvention in the

answer, the defendant can move to fix the case for ex parte trial against

the plaintiff on such cross claim, as such cross claim has the same effect

as the plaint in an action in terms of section 75(e).

Section 87(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows: “Where the

plaintiff or where both the plaintiff and the defendant make default in

appearing on the day fixed for the trial, the court shall dismiss the plaintiff's

action.”

How a plaintiff may purge default is set out in section 87(3) of the Civil

Procedure Code. In terms of section 87(3), the plaintiff can make an

application to the District Court to purge default within a reasonable time

from the date of the dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. Section 87(3) reads:

“The plaintiff may apply within a reasonable time from the date of

dismissal, by way of petition supported by affidavit, to have the dismissal

set aside, and if on the hearing of such application, of which the defendant

shall be given notice, the court is satisfied that there were reasonable

grounds for the non-appearance of the plaintiff, the court shall make order

setting aside the dismissal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it

thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the action as from

the stage at which the dismissal for default was made.”

In terms of section 88(1) “No appeal shall lie against any judgment entered

upon default.” This means a final appeal cannot be filed from an ex parte

7

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

judgment entered against a defendant for failure to file answer or for want

of appearance of the defendant on the trial date. A final appeal also cannot

be filed from a judgment entered against a plaintiff for want of appearance

on the trial date. In such a situation, if the defaulter is the defendant an

application under section 86(2) or if the defaulter is the plaintiff an

application under section 87(3) shall first be made to purge the default

before contesting the case of the opposite party on the merits.

In terms of section 88(2) as it stands now (after its amendment by the Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 5 of 2022), the order made after

such inquiry to purge default is appealable by the dissatisfied party with

the leave of the High Court first had and obtained. Section 88(2) as it

stands now reads: “The order setting aside or refusing to set aside the

judgment entered upon default shall accompany the facts upon which it is

adjudicated and specify the grounds upon which it is made, and shall be

liable to an appeal to the relevant High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution, with leave first had and obtained from such High Court.”

However, section 88(1) has no application when the plaintiff’s action is

dismissed on the merits (as in the instant case), not on the default of the

plaintiff as contemplated in section 87(1). The contention of learned

counsel for the 1st defendant that when the plaintiff’s action is dismissed

after the ex parte trial, the judgment ceases to be a judgment in terms of

section 88(1) or that the defendants cease to be in default because the

judgment is then in favour of the defendants, has no merit. The default

will continue until it is purged. The further contention of learned counsel

for the 1st defendant that in such circumstances this Court can grant relief

under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code or on the principles of

natural justice also has no merit. This Court cannot grant relief to the 1st

defendant under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. That section is

applicable to the District Court, not to this Court. In any event, section

8

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

839 cannot be invoked when there are express provisions in the Civil

Procedure Code to deal with the situation. There is no necessity to

desperately look for ways to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court or

this Court to grant relief to the 1st defendant. Section 86(2) is very clear.

The High Court has now directed the District Court to enter judgment for

the plaintiff. Once the ex parte judgment is entered and the decree is

served on the defendants, they can within fourteen days of service of the

decree make an application by petition and affidavit to purge the default

in terms of section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. If they succeed, the

ex parte judgment will automatically be rendered nugatory regardless of

its merits or demerits and the defendants will get the opportunity to file

answer and contest the plaintiff’s case on the merits. If the defendants are

unsuccessful in their application to purge the default, in terms of section

88(2) they can file a leave to appeal application against that order to the

High Court. The 1st defendant is not without a remedy. There is no

necessity to invoke the inherent powers of the Court or the principles of

natural justice.

In terms of section 88(1), the 1st defendant could not have filed an appeal

before the High Court if the ex parte judgment was entered against her by

the District Court. If appeal does not lie against an ex parte judgment, no

leave to appeal lies, since in the event leave is granted, the application

becomes an appeal. What cannot be done directly cannot be done

indirectly: Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo, prohibetur et per obliquum.

Upon taking up the case ex parte against the defendant, if the District

Court dismisses the plaintiff’s action on the merits, the plaintiff can file

an appeal to the High Court against that judgment. As I stated previously,

in such an eventuality, section 88(1) has no application as the judgment

was not entered against the plaintiff on his default. It is true that the

defendant (defaulter) is made a party to such appeal. Once the defendant

9

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

is made a party, is the defendant entitled as of right to a hearing? The

answer is in the negative. The defendant is made a party to be given notice

that an appeal has been filed against the judgment of the District Court

dismissing the plaintiff’s action. The defendant, if he wishes, can appear

before the High Court and be a passive observer or silent spectator to the

proceedings. The defendant has no right of audience but the High Court

in the exercise of its inherent powers may get any matters clarified through

the defendant to come to a just conclusion. In any event, the defendant

will not get the opportunity to fully present his case before the High Court

because the High Court of Civil Appeal is not a trial Court but an appellate

Court. Vide Arumugam v. Kumaraswamy [2000] BLR 55.

Under section 88(1) there is a statutory bar to filing an appeal against an

ex parte judgment. What about other instances whereby Courts make

numerous ex parte orders, not judgments? When an ex parte order is

made, can the affected party straightaway go before the appellate Court

against that order? The answer is in the negative. Vide Jana Shakthi

Insurance v. Dasanayake [2005] 1 Sri LR 299 at 303, Penchi v. Sirisena

[2012] 1 Sri LR 402 at 408. In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd [1987] 1 Sri LR 5, the Supreme Court, citing several

authorities (Loku Menika v. Selenduhamy (1947) 48 NLR 353, Habibu

Lebbe v. Punchi Etana (1894) 3 CLR 85, Caldera v. Santiagopulle (1920) 22

Marine & General Insurance Co Ltd (1962) 66 NLR 472, Nagappan v.

Lankabarana Estates Ltd (1971) 75 NLR 488), held “A party seeking to

canvass an order entered ex parte against him must apply in the first

instance to the court which made it. This is a rule of practice which has

become deeply ingrained in our legal system.” This time-tested rule is

applicable not only when an ex parte order is made by a Court of law but

also by any tribunal, administrative or quasi-judicial body.

10

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

However, in an exceptional situation, the High Court can exercise

revisionary jurisdiction to set aside an ex parte judgment or order made

by the original Court provided it is palpably wrong, perverse and results

in a manifest failure of justice (Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake v. Times of

Ceylon Limited [1995] 1 Sri LR 22). The judgment in Mrs. Sirimavo

Bandaranayake’s case shall not be misinterpreted to argue that as a

general rule the law provides for the invocation of the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court to canvass ex parte judgments or orders on

the merits. This is what M.D.H. Fernando J. stated at 40:

I hold that an ex parte default judgment cannot be entered without a

hearing and an adjudication. I further hold that having regard to the

facts and circumstances of this case, there has been no adjudication

at all; it was not a mere error in exercising a judicial discretion, or in

assessing the credibility of a witness, or the weight of evidence;

judgment in favour of the Plaintiff was unreasonable and perverse

insofar as it was based on the assumption that the Defendant had

published the impugned statements; the Plaintiff’s lawyers failed in

their duty to the Court; the substantial rights of the Defendant were

prejudiced, and there has been a manifest failure of justice. The

exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal was both

lawful and proper. (emphasis mine)

The revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be invoked citing

Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake’s case to thwart the express provisions of

section 88(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. The rule is that before an ex

parte judgment or order is challenged on the merits, the default shall be

purged.

It appears that the main reason for the 1st defendant to come before this

Court against the judgment of the High Court without purging default is,

according to learned counsel for the 1st defendant, that there is a statutory

11

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

bar to the 1st defendant making an application to purge default under

section 86(2) because section 59 of the Mortgage Act debars the 1st

defendant from making an application under section 87(3) of the Civil

Procedure Code when the ex parte judgment has been entered in a

hypothecary action.

Section 59 of the Mortgage Act as it appears in the 1980 (unofficial) revised

edition of the Legislative Enactments reads as follows: “Where a

hypothecary action is heard ex parte under section 84 and 85 of the Civil

Procedure Code, the decree entered thereunder shall not be set aside under

the provisions of section 86 of that Code, and the judgement entered

thereunder shall not be deemed to be a judgement entered upon default for

the purpose of section 88 of that Code.” It is stated by way of an explanation

in the revised edition that “This section has been recast as reference to

“decree nisi” and “decree absolute” in section 84 and 85 of the Civil

Procedure Code have been omitted by a 1977 amendment of that Code.” It

is this formulation of section 59 of the Mortgage Act that has been relied

upon by learned counsel for the 1st defendant. According to the 1956

(official) edition of the Legislative Enactments, section 59 of the Mortgage

Act reads as follows: “Where a hypothecary action is heard ex parte under

section 85 of the Civil Procedure Code, the decree shall be a decree absolute

and not a decree nisi.”

As clearly explained in Sitthi Maleena and Another v. Nihal Ignatius Perera

and Others [1994] 3 Sri LR 270, the change made to section 59 of the

Mortgage Act by the learned authors of the 1980 (unofficial) edition of the

Legislative Enactments does not represent the correct position of the law

and therefore need not be adopted. Although the Civil Procedure Code, by

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1977, underwent

radical changes including the repeal and replacement of Chapter XII which

provides for proceedings in the event of default in appearance, section 59

12

SC/APPEAL/78/2021

of the Mortgage Act which makes reference to the original section 85 of the

Civil Procedure Code was not amended in line with the Civil Procedure

Code amendment. The original section 85 of the Civil Procedure Code

specifically referred to hypothecary actions and stated that if the defaulter

was a defendant in a hypothecary action, instead of decree nisi, decree

absolute should be entered straightaway. However the original section 87

of the Civil Procedure Code further provided that when decree absolute

was so entered, the defendant could apply to the District Court within a

reasonable time to have it vacated, thus providing the defaulter an

opportunity to challenge the decree. By Act No. 20 of 1977 inter alia

references to decree nisi and decree absolute were removed and the

common word decree was used instead. These changes are not reflected

in section 59 of the Mortgage Act as it presently stands.

Section 16(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance No. 6 of 1949 states “Where

in any written law or document reference is made to any written law which

is subsequently repealed, such reference shall be deemed to be made to the

written law by which the repeal is effected or to the corresponding portion

thereof.” Hence the default of a defendant in a hypothecary action is

governed by the present provisions of Chapter XII of the Civil Procedure

Code and therefore the contention of learned counsel for the 1st defendant

that section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be availed of by the

1st defendant is misconceived in law. Once the ex parte decree is served

on the defendants they can make an application to purge default in terms

of section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and take further steps in

accordance with the law. It is unfortunate that judges and lawyers still

rely on section 59 of the Mortgage Act as it incorrectly appears in the 1980

(unofficial) edition of the Legislative Enactments (e.g. Australanka

Exporters Pvt Ltd v. Indian Bank [2001] 2 Sri LR 156) and this must be

stopped.
