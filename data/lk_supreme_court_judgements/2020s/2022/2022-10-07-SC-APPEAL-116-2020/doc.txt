BEFORE : L.T.B. DEHIDENIYA, J. MURDU N.B. FERNANDO, PC, J. ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J. COUNSEL : M. Adamaly with Aeinsley Silva for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant instructed by Ms. Shanya Wickramarathna. Ms. Sudarshani Cooray for the (b), (c), (d) and (e) Substituted-Defendant-Appellant-Respondents

ARGUED ON : 09th February, 2021 DECIDED ON : 07th October, 2022 ********** ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

“the Plaintiff”) instituted two separate actions in the District Court and

the Additional District Court of Negombo, under case Nos. 6901/L and

6906/L respectively, against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent, later

substituted by 1(a) to (e) Substituted-Defendant-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”) upon his death. With the

institution of the said actions, the Plaintiff sought declaration from

Court of her title to lots D3 and E, morefully described in the respective

schedules to the plaints and as depicted in Plan No. 685 of 11.03.1967,

prepared by licenced surveyor M.D.J.V. Perera. She also sought eviction

of the said Defendant and his agents therefrom along with an award of

damages quantified at Rs. 700,000.00. The Defendant, in his answer had,

in addition to seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffs actions, also sought a

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

4

declaration of his title over the said two lots by claiming that he had

acquired prescriptive title of the same.

Parties proceeded to trial in both cases after marking several

admissions and settling for 20 trial issues between them in case No.

6906/L and 31 trial issues in case No. 6901/L respectively. Learned

District Judge as well as the learned Additional District Judge, with

pronouncement of their separate judgments on 07.03.2014 and

01.11.2013, have held with the Plaintiff and rejected the claim of

prescription of the Defendant. Being aggrieved by the said judgments,

the Defendant had preferred sperate appeals to the High Court of Civil

Appeal in Negombo under appeal Nos. WP/HCCA/NEG/03/2014 (F)

and WP/HCCA/NEG /39/2013(F). The High Court of Civil Appeal

had accordingly pronounced two separate judgments in respect of each

of the said appeals on 14.12.2018 and allowed them.

The Plaintiff had thereupon sought Leave to Appeal from this

Court in SC Application No. SC/HCCA/LA/47/2019 against the

judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal in Appeal No.

WP/HCCA/NEG/03/2014(F) while seeking Leave to Appeal in SC

Application No. SC/HCCA/LA/48/2019 against the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal in WP/HCCA/NEG/39/2013(F). This

Court, having considered both these applications of the Plaintiff on

25.06.2020, was inclined to grant leave on the following question of law,

in relation to both of these applications:

Whether the learned Judges of the High Court erred in

law in failing to appreciate that the Defendant failed to

show an overt act or adverse possession against the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

5

Plaintiff’s predecessors namely, the Defendant’s sisters,

during the period 1969-1994?

With grating of Leave to Appeal, SC Application No. SC/

HCCA/LA/47/ 2019 was renumbered as SC Appeal No. 116 of 2020,

whereas SC Application No. SC/HCCA/LA/48/2019 was renumbered

as SC Appeal No. 117 of 2020. Since both these appeals will have to be

decided on the identical question of law arising out of the impugned

judgments, that had been pronounced against the backdrop of almost

identical factual situation as revealed from the body of evidence

presented before trial Courts in both cases, on the invitation of the

parties at the hearing both appeals were heard together, and thus a

common judgment is pronounced in relation to each of the said appeals

but under the relevant captions.

Before I proceed to consider the said question of law, in the light

of the submissions made by the respective learned Counsel, it is helpful

if the respective cases that had presented before the trial Courts by the

two parties are referred to at the outset albeit briefly, as indicated in

their pleadings, issues and in their evidence.

One Malwana Tudugalage David Barlin Perera, who was married to

Padukkage Lawarina Perera had fathered three children, namely Malwana

Tudugalage Theobold Perera, Malwana Tudugalage Juliet Perera and

Malwana Tudugalage Lilian Perera. Barlin Perera, became entitled to two

allotments of land in total extent of 69.4 Perches, depicted as lots D and

E, in Plan No. 436P dated 30.04.1954, that had been carved out of a

larger land called Midellagahawatta alias Delgahawatta, upon a final

partition decree in Case No. 1720/P of the District Court of Gampaha

dated 30.04.1954. In the year 1967, Barlin Perera, through plan No. 685 of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

6

11.03.1962 of licenced surveyor M.D.J.V. Perera (P1), had subdivided the

said lot D of plan 436P into three subdivided parcels of land, depicted

in the said subsequent plan as lots D1, D2 and D3, while retaining lot E

of the partition plan No. 436P as it is. Thus, in Plan No. 685, the

subdivided lots D1, D2, D3 and lot E (as depicted in plan No. 436P) are

shown as sperate and distinct allotments of land. Lot D1 is in extent of

20 Perches. Lot D2 is in extent of 24.62 Perches, while lot D3 is in extent

of 17.38 Perches. Lot E as per partition plan and plan No. 685, is in

extent of 7.4 Perches. Lots D3 and E too shared a common boundary.

Thereupon, Barlin Perera and his wife, by execution of three

Deeds of Gift, have transferred their title to the said three subdivided

lots along with lot E to their three children on 05.06.1967. The

Defendant, being the eldest of the three children of Barlin Perera, and

the only male child, had received title to lot D2, through the Deed of

Gift No. 2572 (V2a). Deed of Gift No. 2571 (V3) was executed in favour

of Malwana Tudugalage Juliet Perera, and she was given title to lot D1 of

plan No. 685. The youngest girl of the family, Malwana Tudugalage Lilian

Therese Perera received lot D3 and E of plan No. 436P, through Deed of

Gift No. 2573 (V1).

In the same year, Lilian Perera had gifted her title to lots D3 and E

to sister Juliet Perera by Deed of Gift No. 6983 of 20.12.1980. Thus, Juliet

Perera became entitled to lot D1, D3 and E. After a period of eight years

since the execution of the said deed of gift, Juliet Perera had transferred

her title over lot D1, D3 and E to Dinapala de Silva through Deed of

Transfer No. 1188 on 18.01.1988. Said Dinapala de Silva had died

intestate and his heirs have thereafter transferred title to lots D1, D3 and

E back to Juliet Perera on 10.12.1993 through Deed of Transfer No. 181,

who then made another transfer of the title to lots D1, D3 and E, in

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

7

favour of Don Calistus Gamini Ponweera by Deed of Transfer No. 208, on

10.04.1994. The Plaintiff had acquired ownership to lots D3 and E,

through the Deed of Transfer No. 333 (P3), executed by said Gamini

Ponweera, who retained title to lot D1 to himself.

In instituting action in case No. 6901 on 10.07.2007, the Plaintiff

sought a declaration of Court of her title to lot D3 and in case No. 6906,

instituted on 19.07.2007, she sought a declaration of her title to lot E.

The Plaintiff also sought ejectment of the Defendant from both these

lots. The Plaintiff, by suggesting several issues (Nos. 2, 3 and 10 in case

No. 6901/L, Nos. 2B, 3B and 8 in case No. 6906/L), had sought

determinations from Court as to the possession of the disputed parcels

of land. These trial issues were suggested to the effect, whether she had

possessed the disputed land after Gamini Ponweera transferred its title

by Deed No. 333, whether the Defendant was placed in possession upon

execution of the decree of Case No. 1343/RE of District Court of

Negombo and whether the Defendant is in illegal possession of the land

since 14.06.1994. The Defendant too had suggested trial issues on the

question of possession in issue Nos. 11 and 12 in SC Appeal No. 116/20

and 13 and 14 in SC Appeal 117/20.

The Defendant, in his answer as well as in evidence, had

admitted the execution of all the title deeds that had been relied upon

by the Plaintiff in support of her description of devolution of title, as

averred in the plaints. Since these two actions are considered Rei

Vindicatio actions by the trial Courts, with the said admission of

Plaintiff’s title to lots D3 and E by the Defendant, both Courts have held

that she had established her title over same. Then, it was for the

Defendant to establish that he possessed the disputed lots D3 and E on

a superior title to that of the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s position was that

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

8

he had acquired title to these two lots through prescription and

suggested issues on that premise. The issues of the Defendant referred

to whether the Plaintiff or her predecessors in title never possessed the

lands as described in the 3rd, 4th and 5th schedule to his answer (lots D2,

D3 and E respectively) and whether the Defendant had adversely and

exclusively possessed these parcels of lands against the rights of

“others” (“wka whf.a”) independently for an uninterrupted period of

over forty years commencing from the year 1969.

In support of the said claim on prescription, the Defendant had

asserted that he had possessed lots D1, D2, D3 and E as one contiguous

land ever since his father was conferred with title to same upon a

partition decree in 1954. It is his position that despite the subdivision of

lot D by Plan No. 685 and execution of Deeds of Gift in 1967, none of his

sisters ever came to possess the sub divided lots that are allocated to

them. He further asserted it was his father who built a house on that

land, and then put up a parapet wall right around the entire property

which consisted of four lots and installed a gate. The Defendant

however claims that the house standing on the said property was

rented out by his father later by him. The Defendant also claimed that

he only had appropriated its rent throughout.

In 1977, when the then tenant Simion Perera had fallen into arrears

of rent, it was the Defendant who had instituted Case No. 1343/RE

(P10) on 27.06.1987, and thereby seeking to evict the defaulting tenant.

In the schedule to the plaint, the Defendant, for reasons best known to

him, had described the boundaries of land on which the rented-out

premises stood, by copying the description of boundaries as given in

the partition decree. The Defendant made no reference in that

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

9

description to the subsequent plan No. 685, which subdivided lot D of

partition plan No. 436P into three lots D1, D2 and D3 in the year 1967.

The trial against Simion Perera had proceeded ex parte and the

Court held in the Defendant’s favour. The Defendant was thereafter

placed in possession by the Fiscal by executing the writ of possession on

02.02.1987. Simion Perera at that stage had sought to purge his default

and was successful in his endeavour. Therefore, he was restored back in

possession by an order of Court on 01.04.1991. The Defendant preferred

an appeal against the said order to the Court of Appeal in appeal No.

CA 139/89(F). The appellate Court set aside the said order in favour of

Simion Perera. With the death of Simion Perera, his son Lesley Perera was

substituted to prosecute the Special Leave to Appeal application

No.170/98, by which the said judgment of the Court of Appeal was

impugned.

On 08.12.1998, this Court had refused granting leave to the said

application. Thereupon, the Defendant was placed back in possession

on 14.06.1999 by the fiscal, after evicting said Lesly Perera from the land,

as described in the schedule to the plaint in Case No. 1343/RE. In that

process the Plaintiff and Gamini Ponweera, who claims to have been in

possession of their respective lots up to that point of time, were also

evicted. They moved the trial Court under section 328 of the Civil

Procedure Code. On the day of inquiry into the application of Gamini

Ponweera, the Defendant had conceded to the former’s possession over

lot E and recorded a settlement. The application of the Plaintiff was

dismissed by the Court due to her failure to pursue same diligently. In

2007, the Plaintiff instituted the instant actions, seeking eviction of the

Defendant from lots D3 and E.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

10

At the conclusion of the two trials instituted by the Plaintiff, the

District Court as well as the Additional District Court, in their

respective judgments, rejected the claim of the Defendant that he had

acquired prescriptive title to lot Nos. D3 and E upon being in

possession for a long period of time. However, in allowing appeals of

the Defendant, the High Court of Civil Appeal held that the Defendant

had possessed the land from the year 1954 and had specifically

commenced prescription at least in the year 1988 which continued for

well over a period of ten years against a complete outsider Dinapala de

Silva, who had acquired title to the disputed lots from the sister of the

Defendant, Juliet Perera, in 1988 and therefore is entitled to a declaration

of title in his favour.

In seeking to set aside the impugned judgments of the High

Court of Civil Appeal and in addressing the question of law to which

this Court granted leave, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff presented his

submissions primarily on the following grounds;

a. the Defendant’s possession of lots D3 and E were clearly with

the consent of his sister Juliet Perera and therefore the character

of the Defendant’s possession not being adverse to the rights

of his sibling and, as such, his mere possession of same would

not give rights under prescription,

b. the determination of the High Court of Civil Appeal that the

Defendant commenced his adverse possession in 1988, in itself

is a confirmation of the Plaintiff’s contention that the

Defendant’s possession of lots D3 and E was with the

permission of his sister Juliet Perera, and,

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

11

c. the Defendant failed to establish that there was adverse

possession for an uninterrupted period of ten years

commencing from the year 1988, as erroneously held by the

appellate Court.

In an effort to fortify the said contentions, learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff had submitted in relation to his first ground that there was no

adverse possession established by the Defendant against his sister

because the disputed parcels of land remained a co-owned property

since their father’s death. In support of that contention, learned Counsel

had highlighted certain items of evidence which indicate that the

Defendant, being the eldest male in the family, had been in permissive

possession of same on behalf of his younger sisters during their father’s

lifetime. It was also contended that since their father’s death in 1969, the

same state of affairs had continued without a change of its character

until 1988, the year in which Juliet Perera made a transfer of her title to

Dinapala de Silva. Hence, in the absence of an ‘overt act’ on the part of the

Defendant, any secret intention entertained by him to possess lots D3

and E against the interest of his sibling, will not accrue to his benefit in

a claim under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Learned Counsel

also relied on the principles referred to in the judgment of Basnayake CJ

in Gunawardene v Samarakoon et al (1958) 60 NLR 481, in support of

the said contention.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant, in their respective

submissions have sought to counter the said contention on the basis

that with the subdivision made to lot D in 1967, each of the four

subdivided lots had acquired a distinct and an identity of their own,

quite independent of the larger land of lot D and also of each other

subdivided individual lots and due to this reason, there was no co-

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

12

ownership. He further contended that in such circumstances there was

no requirement for him to establish an overt act.

Perusal of judgments of both the District Court and the

Additional District Court reveal that the original Courts had rejected

the Defendant’s claim of prescriptive title to lots D3 and E by adverse

possession for a period of over ten years. The appeals that had been

preferred by the Defendant against the said two judgments were

allowed by the High Court of Civil Appeal by setting aside the said

judgments of the trial Courts. The appellate Court, in doing so, was of

the view that the evidence indicated that the Defendant did not give

any produce from the land to his sisters and had taken the rent entirely

for his benefit, and therefore his claim of prescription had been

established to the required degree of proof, by satisfying the

requirements, as stipulated by section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

However, it also appears that the High Court of Civil Appeal was not

convinced fully with the Defendant’s position that he had commenced

his adverse possession in 1957. Nonetheless, the appellate Court

decided to allow the Defendant’s appeals on the basis that he had

established a period of ten years of undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession, which the said Court found to have commenced in 1988,

after his sister Juliet Perera transferred her title over lots D3 and E to

Dinapala de Silva, a total outsider to their family. The appellate Court

had stated in the impugned judgment “… that the Defendant had

possessed the land in dispute from the year 1954 and had specifically

commenced prescription at least against Dinapala de Silva in the year 1988,

who is a complete outsider, when the Defendant’s sister transferred her right to

Dinapala de Silva”. This statement is common to both the judgments

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

13

pronounced by the High Court of Civil Appeal, in allowing the two

appeals that had been preferred by the Defendant.

The Defendant’s claim of acquisition of prescriptive title to lots

D3 and E is therefore founded essentially upon two pillars. The first is

the Defendant’s assertion that after the execution of the deeds of gift,

none of his sisters ever came to possess their respective lots and he was

in exclusive possession thereof, which had commenced even before his

father’s decision to subdivide same and gift to his three children. The

other is, the Defendant’s claim of possession of the three lots as one

contiguous land through his tenant for over a long period of time, as

indicative from the fact of institution of legal proceedings, by which he

successfully ejected the defaulting tenant.

There was no evidence to indicate that after 1969, none of his

sisters ever had possession over the lots D1, D3 and E. Thus, the

Defendant had either occupied or possessed lots D3 and E after his

father’s death in 1969. But whether the Defendant had possessed same

in the context of the principles of law that are applicable to acquisition

of prescriptive title, as laid down in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, is an important consideration demanding attention of this

Court.

In view of the factual basis on which the High Court of Civil

Appeal has held in Defendant’s favour, I find it convenient to consider

his claim of being in adverse possession of lots D3 and E for over a

period of four decades, by dividing that period of over forty years into

two parts. The period commencing from 1954, the year in which his

father was conferred with title to 1988, the year in which Juliet Perera

had transferred her title to totally an outsider, shall be considered in the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

14

first part. The balance part of the said four-decade long period, which

commenced from the year 1988 and ended with 1994, the year in which

the Plaintiff was evicted upon execution of decree in case No. 1343/RE,

shall be considered thereafter.

Since the Defendant had admitted the devolution of title of the

Plaintiff in the instant actions by which she sought declarations of her

title to lots D3 and E and laid out a prescriptive title to same, it was his

burden to establish that he had acquired prescriptive title by satisfying

all the requirements as envisaged by the provisions of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

In support of discharging his burden in relation to the claim of

prescription, it was incumbent upon the Defendant to establish a

starting point, on which he had commenced his adverse and

uninterrupted possession of lots D3 and E for a period of ten years. This

requirement was insisted upon by Gratiaen J in Chelliah v Wijenathan

et al. (1951) 54 NLR 337 with the statement (at p. 342) that “where a party

invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to

defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden

of proof rests fairly and squarely on him to establish a starting point for his or

her acquisition of prescriptive rights”. This principle of law was reiterated

by G.P.S. De Silva CJ in Sirajudeen and two others v Abbas (1994) 2 Sri

L.R. 365.

It appears from the transcript of the proceedings before the trial

Courts that the Defendant was clearly inconsistent with his stance taken

in relation to the starting point of his adverse possession, when

compared with the one taken in his answers and the one in giving

evidence. In setting up his claim of prescriptive title in his answers, the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

15

Defendant had averred that he possessed lots D1, D3 and E since 1969

for an uninterrupted period of over forty years, adverse to the title of

his sisters. He had raised issues in both trials to the effect whether he

was in adverse and uninterrupted possession for over forty years since

1969 (issue No. 14 in case No. 6901/L and issue No. 12 in case No.

6906/L respectively) in line with his assertions in the answers.

During his examination-in-chief the Defendant had asserted that,

after his father subdivided the land in 1967 and gifted same to each of

his three children, none of his sisters ever came to possess their

respective lots nor did they separate their respective lots with fences

after the said execution of deeds. He further asserts that irrespective of

the said subdivision and execution of deeds of gift in favour of his

sisters, he had exclusively possessed the entire land as one contiguous

land from the year 1967 onwards and thereby advanced the point of

commencement by two years. However, during cross-examination the

Defendant had once again advanced the starting point from 1967 to the

year 1954 aligning with the time of his father’s, conferment of title upon

the partition decree, contradicting the position indicated in his

pleadings and issues.

The claim that he commenced adverse possession from the year

1954 was challenged by the Plaintiff. It was suggested to him during

cross-examination by the Plaintiff that in spite of him being a minor of

16 years of age at that point of time and still dependent on his father for

sustenance, the said claim that he alone possessed the land in its

entirety since the acquisition of title to the lots D and E through the said

partition decree in 1954 was an improbable one. He then added that his

father, since acquisition of its title in 1954, never possessed the land

until his death in 1969. Thus, it was the position of the Defendant that

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

16

he had exclusive possession of the entirety of land, inclusive of lots D1,

D3 and E, for well over four decades and is therefore entitled to a

decree in his favour.

The Defendant’s assertion that ever since his father had acquired

title to the disputed land in 1954 on a partition decree, he had possessed

same adverse to the interests of his own father, whilst being in his

father’s care, is obviously a fanciful claim and had been rejected by the

trial Courts on account of its inherent improbability. In addition to the

said reason, there is yet another compelling reason to reject that claim.

That is because the Defendant had conceded of accepting his father’s

decision to subdivide the land and gift same to the latter’s three

children, with his head “bowed down” in deference, despite his

continued possession of the property from 1954 against rights of his

father. Having admitted the fact that he was aware as to the nature of

possession he ought to have in proof of his prescriptive title during

cross examination by the Plaintiff, the Defendant nonetheless admitted

occupying the land under his father’s ownership throughout this period

and thereby wiping out the character of adverse possession from his

occupation of the property.

Thus, it was clear from the evidence that the Defendant himself

had nullified his own claim of adverse possession that commenced from

1954, by admitting that he had chosen to surrender his “exclusive

possession over the property” to the will of his father without a

whimper of protest when their father decided to gift the subdivided lots

of the said land in 1967 to his three children and thus conceding to the

rights of his father over the land in dispute.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

17

The trial Courts have rejected the Defendant’s claim of

prescriptive title altogether but the High Court of Civil Appeal, despite

the trial issue framed by him on the basis that he commenced adverse

possession in 1969 and his oral assertion of being in possession of the

land since 1954, had taken the year 1988, as the starting point of his

adverse possession. In my view, the Defendant’s assertion relating to

the starting point of his adverse possession of lots D3 and E, is not a

credible and reliable claim, owing to its aforesaid inherent limitations,

and was rightly rejected by the trial Courts. The remaining aspect of the

Defendant’s contention that whether the fact of his long possession of

the land for over four decades, in itself justifies drawing the

presumption of ouster against the Plaintiff and her predecessors in title

shall be considered in the next segment of this judgment. But first, I

shall proceed to consider the nature of possession the Defendant claims

to have had over lots D3 and E during the period commencing from the

year 1954 and ending with the year 1999.

The Plaintiff, in seeking to counter the claim of the Defendant that

none of his sisters have ever possessed the sub divided lots since

execution of deeds of gift in 1967 and he only controlled and derived

income from same, had advanced a contention on the basis that the

possession he claims to have had over lots D3 and E is of permissive

one in nature. By advancing this contention, the Plaintiff may have

sought to explain the obvious inaction of her predecessor in title,

namely Juliet Perera, in not asserting her rights over lots D3 and E, with

the execution of the deed of gift or at least from the point of her father’s

death in 1969. Thus, it appears from the said contention that the fact

only the Defendant was in possession of the disputed property during

the period 1954 to 1988, is admitted.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

18

It is relevant to note that the said contention of permissive

possession had been specifically advanced by the Plaintiff before the

High Court of Civil Appeal as well. The impugned judgments of that

Court indicate that it made reference to the said submissions of the

Plaintiff but had proceeded to reject same on the basis that “the

Defendant had specifically stated in evidence that he did not give the produce

from the land to his sisters”.

In the circumstances, the contention of the Plaintiff, that the

Defendant, being the eldest brother of Juliet Perera, had only permissive

possession over lots D3 and E, ought to be considered and determined

in the backdrop of the evidence presented before the trial Courts, upon

the principles that are enunciated in judicial precedents, which dealt

with similar factual situations.

In this context, it must be noted that the said contention of

permissive possession was presented before the High Court of Civil

Appeal as well as this Court is based on the issues suggested by the

Plaintiff as well as the Defendant before the trial Courts. The

Defendant, in particular had suggested two trial issues in each case that

are in relation to the very nature of possession the Plaintiff had over the

lots D3 and E, on which he sought determinations by Court.

These issues (namely issue Nos. 11 and 12 in SC Appeal No.

116/20 and 13 and 14 in SC Appeal 117/20) dealt with the disputed

factual positions of the parties, namely, whether the Plaintiff or her

predecessors in title have never possessed in whatever form (“lsisÿ

wdldrhl nqla;shla”) to the lands as described in the 3rd, 4th and 5th

schedule to his answer ( lots D2, D3 and E respectively) and whether

the Defendant had adversely and exclusively possessed these parcels of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

19

lands against the rights of “others” (“wka whf.a”) independently and for

an uninterrupted period of over forty years, commencing from the year

1969.

It is evident that the Defendant, in suggesting the said trial issues,

had raised them on the basis that neither the Plaintiff nor her

predecessors in title ever had any form of possession over the disputed

lots D3 and E. He also sought a determination of Court on his claim of

acquisition of title to these two lots by adverse possession for a long

period of time which over four decades by suggesting the other issues.

Thereby the Defendant had invited the District Court as well as the

Additional District Court to determine one of the primary facts in

dispute, namely whether the Plaintiff and her predecessors in title,

never possessed the disputed parcels of land, in whatever form of

possession known to law. Thus, the contention of the Plaintiff, based on

permissive possession of a sibling, must be considered in the light of the

reasoning adopted by the Courts below and the evidence presented

before the trial Courts along with inferences that could reasonably be

drawn from such evidence.

Before I proceed to consider the evidence on this aspect, it is

helpful to take note of an approach, which the superior Courts have

consistently applied, when dealing with situations such as the one that

had been presented before this Court in the instant appeals.

When one relies on adverse possession in setting up a claim of

prescriptive title against another under provisions of section 3 of

Prescription Ordinance, it appears that the Superior Courts have

applied a slightly different criterion in assessing validity of such a

claim, depending on the fact whether there is a familial relationship in

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

20

existence between the contesting parties, vis a vis the criterion they had

adopted in the assessment of such a claim that had been laid against a

total stranger.

The judgment of Maduwanwela v Ekneligoda (1898) 3 NLR 213,

relates to an instance where a sister of one Tikiri Banda, who was

allowed to live in the latter’s house with charitable intentions of the

former and to take fruit and produce as she pleased from the land when

she had no means of support. She had subsequently executed a lease on

that property. Upon her death, her children claimed that their mother

had acquired prescriptive title to the property and relied on the act of

execution of a lease, in support of that claim. Bonser CJ, agreed with the

finding of the trial Court that the sister of Tikiri Banda is merely an

occupier and “she had no possession of this property, but had merely

occupation under licence of her brother.” Similarly, the judgment of Abdul

Majeed v Ummu Zaneera et al. (1959) 61 NLR 361 is in relation to an

instance where a co-owner had set up a prescriptive claim against the

other members of his family. In the course of the said judgment De Silva

J, stated (at p.371) that “Our social customs and family ties have some

bearing on the possession of immovable property owned in common and should

not be lost sight of. Many of our people consider it unworthy to alienate

ancestral lands to strangers. Those who are in more affluent circumstances

permit their less fortunate relatives to take the income of ancestral property

owned in common. But that does not mean that they intend to part with their

rights in those lands permanently. Very often if the income derived from such a

property is not high the co-owner or co-owners who reside on it are permitted

to enjoy the whole of it by the other co-owners who live far away. But such a

co-owner should not be penalised for his generous disposition by converting the

permissive possession of the recipient of his benevolence to adverse possession”.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

21

His Lordship, in dealing with the 13th defendant’s position that

his mother Muttu Natchia had ‘put him in complete possession’ of the

property and by being in sole and exclusive possession of it he had

acquired a prescriptive title to the entire property, had rejected that

claim by stating (at p.370) “It would not be strange if the 13th defendant

collected the rent and looked after the building and before him his father did so.

Of the three children of Muttu Natchia, the 13th defendant's father was the

only male. That being so it is quite natural, these parties being Muslims, that

the 13th defendant's father, the only male in the family, was in charge of the

premises and collected the rent. On the death of the father the son may well

have taken over those duties without any objection from the other co-

owners.” An appeal from the judgment of Abdul Majeed v Ummu

Zaneera et al (supra) had been preferred to Privy Council by the

appellants. In determining the said appeal the Privy Council, in its

judgment of Hussaima v Ummu Zaneera (1961) 65 NLR 125, had

affirmed the rejection of the said claim of prescription, and noted the

point made by De Silva J, that the 13th defendant was the only son of the

original grantor's wife.

The judgment of De Silva v Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (1973) 80 NLR 292 dealt with a situation where a son had

claimed acquisition of prescriptive title against his mother over a land

in extent of over 200 acres called Dewatawatta on the basis that he had

possession of same in its entirety from 1951 to 1965, appropriated its

income, paid acreage taxes, paid wealth and land taxes on that land. In

delivering the judgment, Sharvananda J (as he was then) had laid down

the principles of law that are applicable in relation to consideration of

such a claim of prescription. It is necessary to quote extensively from

his Lordship’s pronouncement of the applicable principles of law, in

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

22

order to retain its context and clarity. His Lordship stated thus (at p.

295);

“The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the

possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The

acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with

the rights of the true owner; the person in possession must

claim to be so as of right as against the true owner. Where

there is no hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner

there can be no adverse possession. In deciding whether the

alleged acts of the person constitute adverse possession, regard

must be had to the animus of the person doing those acts, and

this must be ascertained from the facts and circumstances of

each case and the relationship of the parties. Possession which

may be presumed to be adverse in the case of a stranger may

not attract such a presumption, in the case of persons standing

in certain social or legal relationships. The presumption

represents the most likely inference that may be drawn in the

context of the relationship of the parties. The Court will always

attribute possession to a lawful title where that is possible.

Where the possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must

be assumed, in the absence of evidence, that the possession is

lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is held

by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the

son was on behalf of and with the permission of the mother.

Such permissive possession is not in denial of the title of the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

23

mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It will not

enable the possession to acquire title by adverse possession.

Where possession commenced with permission, it will be

presumed to so continue until and unless something adverse

occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show when

and how the possession became adverse. Continued

appropriation of the income and payment of taxes will not be

sufficient to convert permissive possession into adverse

possession, unless such conduct unequivocally manifests

denial of the perimeter’s title. In order to discharge such onus,

there must be clear and affirmative evidence of the change in

the character of possession. The evidence must point to the

time of commencement of adverse possession. Where the

parties were not at arms-length, strong evidence of a positive

character is necessary to establish the change of character.”

In a more recent pronouncement of this Court in Jayasinghe

Pathman v Somapala (SC Appeal No. 6/14 - decided on 19.11.2021),

Dehideniya J too had adopted a similar approach in holding that “where

the property belongs to a family member, the presumption will be that it is

‘permissive possession’ which is not in denial of the title of the family member

who is the true owner of the property and is consequently not averse to

him/her.”

Returning to the said contention of the Plaintiff, that the

Defendant only had permissive possession of lots D3 and E, it must be

observed that the Plaintiff did not call any witness who could speak

that the Defendant was merely permitted to occupy the land by his

sister. Except for the reference to that the action to evict Simion Perera

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

24

was instituted by the Defendant was for and on behalf of his sister as

well, there was no other evidence to support such an inference. But it is

the Defendant who had set up a prescriptive claim and he should

satisfy Court that he had possessed the property in the manner as set

out in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance and establish his claim of

possession, as per issue Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 respectively. The

Defendant, however asserted that he only possessed the land in

addition to advancing the position that none of his sisters ever had any

possession. This claim of inaction by his sisters Lilian and Juliet to

assume his exclusive possession over lots D3 and E could be due to

various reasons, including the one asserted by the Defendant. It could

be that the Defendant may have had possessed the property adverse to

the rights of his sister.

But it is also equally possible that Juliet Perera was under the

impression that her brother’s continued possession of the property after

the demise of their father is merely a continuation of his act of

managing the property under her permissive possession as her father

did, when he was alive. There is also the probability that she may have

acquiesced the conduct of the Defendant in possessing the property and

collecting the rent or that she may have even abandoned her rights over

that property in favour of the Defendant. Therefore, the evidence must

justify exclusion of the other probable reasons which explain the said

conduct attributed particularly to Juliet Perera, except the one that the

Defendant had relied on, in support of his claim of adverse possession.

In this context, if the said contention of the Plaintiff is to be

accepted as the more probable reason to explain Juliet Perera’s conduct

of inaction, there must be evidence to suggest that Juliet Perera had

abandoned her rights over the disputed property or that she had

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

25

acquiesced the continued possession and enjoyment of her property by

the Defendant. When one considers the relative probabilities of Juliet

Perera abandoning her rights simply due to the reason of her conduct of

not taking any positive action to possess the two lots upon their father’s

death, it must be noted that the evidence however points in favour of a

contrary situation. After Lilian Perera was gifted with title to lots D3 and

E in 1967 by her father Barlin Perera, she had gifted same to her sister

Juliet Perera in 1980 by Deed of Gift 6983. Juliet Perera, after retaining

title over lots D1, D3 and E for over two decades, transferred same to

Dinapala de Silva in 1988, for valuable consideration. Dinapala de Silva

had no familial relationship to Juliet Perera. When heirs of Dinapala de

Silva, have re-transferred the title over these lots after a period of five

years back to her, Juliet Perera had thereupon executed a transfer of her

title to all three lots, D1, D3 and E, in favour of another stranger Gamini

Ponweera in 1994, once again for valuable consideration.

This series of transactions indicate that Juliet Perera and Lilian

Perera were alive to their rights over the designated lots that were gifted

to them and had regularly exercised one of the attributes of ownership,

i.e., their right to alienate property. These positive actions of the two

sisters indicate that they had not abandoned their rights over the lots

D1, D3 and E, at any point of time during 1967 to 1988.

The other probable reason for Juliet Perera’s said conduct, whether

she had acquiesced to the Defendant’s possession and enjoyment of the

income, is necessarily interwoven with the Plaintiff’s contention of

permissive possession and her knowledge that the permissive

possession of the Defendant over lots D3 and E had transformed into

adverse possession, which is in denial of her title to the property.

Hence, the question whether it is probable that she had acquiesced the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

26

Defendant’s adverse possession should be considered along with the

question whether Juliet Perera granted permissive possession to the

Defendant.

In view of the contention of permissive possession, that had been

advanced by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff, it is necessary to refer

to the nature of evidence upon which the said contention was founded.

The Plaintiff did not call any of the Defendant’s sisters to give

evidence on her behalf, particularly in support of permissive

possession. They are undoubtedly the best witnesses to confirm or deny

granting such permission. The witness for the Plaintiff, who testified on

her behalf, could only speak to the events which followed the

acquisition of title to these two lots by his wife. Thus, the only evidence

relating to the exact nature of possession and the circumstances under

which the land in its entirety was possessed during the period

commencing from 1967 to 1988, the year Juliet Perera transferred her

rights to Dinapala de Silva, had been tendered by the Defendant.

Thus, the assessment of the relative probabilities of the Plaintiff’s

contention of allowing the Defendant to be in possession of lots D3 and

E by his sister to manage same on her behalf or she had acquiesced his

possession with the knowledge that he holds the property against her

rights, will have to be assessed from the evidence of the latter for only

he had knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances and therefore

could give direct evidence on those aspects.

Seeking to counter the Defendant’s assertion that he only

instituted action to evict the overholding tenant, in support of his claim

that he had possessed the lots D3 and E adverse to the interests of Juliet

Perera, the witness for the Plaintiff stated in his evidence that although

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

27

the action for eviction of Simion Perera was instituted by the Defendant

but it was on behalf of his sister as well. He then explained the reason as

to why such a course of action was followed. The witness for the

Plaintiff said in evidence that “ wms okak mrsos ;sfhdfn`,aâ fmf¾rd kvqj od,d

;sfhkafka' thd tlal b|,d ;sfhkjd kx.s,d fokafkla' tlu ify`orhd ksid uq¿

bvugu fuhd ;ud kvq od,d ;sfhkafk”. However, it must be noted that the

said reference to an institution of a joint action by the witness for the

Plaintiff was apparently based on what he may have learnt from his

predecessors in title, for he had no direct knowledge of the same and

therefore could be termed as hearsay evidence.

The significance of this item of evidence is that it is consistent

with the contention that had been advanced by the Plaintiff seeking to

justify an inference of permissive possession and as such, the action for

eviction of tenant could well have been instituted by the Defendant in

1985 with the blessings of Juliet Perera, who acted on the belief that her

eldest brother in her permissive possession of lots D3 and E, and is

continuing in that capacity even after sixteen years since their father’s

death, taken action to evict an overholding tenant. Not only the

Defendant had failed to specifically negate this aspect of the Plaintiff’s

case in his evidence, but had tacitly admitted that position, in admitting

that he merely continued to manage the property in the same manner

even after his father’s death.

There is no dispute that Barlin Perera, after being quieted in

possession following the execution of partition decree in 1954, had

possessed the entirety of the said land ut dominus. He constructed a

house on that land and also constructed a parapet wall around the

property and had thereafter rented it out. When the deeds of gift were

executed, the said tenant of Barlin Perera was already in possession of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

28

one of the buildings, despite the fact that after the subdivision in 1967,

the house the tenant occupied now stood on lots D3 and E while the

‘hut’ shifted to lot D2. During the two-year period between 1967 and

1969, Barlin Perera had continued to be in possession of the entire land

through his tenant and had continued to collect rent from the tenant

through his son, the Defendant.

There is no evidence that the Defendant had assumed the status

of landlord although he collected rent on his father’s behalf, during

latter’s lifetime. There was no assertion by the Defendant that, before

the execution of deeds of gift, he was considered to be the landlord of

the tenant who occupied the house standing on lots D3 and E, either by

his father or by the tenant, despite him collecting rent. In effect their

father was managing the property, through the Defendant, for and on

behalf of all three of his children, even though he had no title over the

property remaining in him by then, except for the life interest. None of

his children had objected to their father’s said conduct nor did any of

them demanded a share from the rent. They have silently accepted their

father’s dominance over the affairs in relation to the property and its

income. In other words, having gifted each of his three children with

the title of sub-divided lots, their father had thereupon continued to be

in possession of the land in its entirety along with the buildings

standing thereon, and managed the same for and on behalf of his three

children. This particular state of affairs indicates that the three children

had tacitly permitted their father to possess their respective lots for and

on their behalf. Thus, it is evident that the nature of the ‘possession’ the

Defendant’s father had over lots D1, D2 D3 and E, during the period of

1967 and 1969 is clearly a one of permissive possession.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

29

A relevant question that arises in these circumstances is whether

the said status of permissive possession had changed with the death of

Barlin Perera in 1969?

In fact, the Defendant himself concedes that it did not. During his

cross examination in case No. 6901/L he admitted that after the death of

his father, he had merely continued to manage the property in the same

manner as he did during his father’s lifetime. In order to assess the

context in which the said admission was made, it is helpful if that

segment of evidence is reproduced below in its entirety.

As indicative from the segment of evidence that had been

reproduced above, it is reasonable to assume that after the execution of

deeds in favour of the two younger sisters, the permissive possession of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

30

the Defendant had over the lots D1, D3 and E, was continued without a

change, keeping with the said family arrangement, even after the death

of their father. Thus, with the death of their father, it is more probable

that the Defendant had substituted himself to the shoes of his father

who had permissive possession over the lots D1, D3 and E, for and on

behalf of the two younger females.

The segment of evidence reproduced above also indicates that the

Defendant had conceded to the position that, being the eldest and the

only male child in the family, he was asked by his father only to ‘look

after’ the property. The Defendant asserted that his father gave the

property to “n,d.kak”. None of his sisters were married at that time.

Hence, it is evident that his father’s intention would have been to

entrust the property in its entirety to the Defendant, with the

expectation that his son would protect the interests of his sisters over

same, whilst looking after his own lot D2. The very word used by his

father in asking the Defendant to look after (“n,d.kak”) the property is

significant in this context. It indicates that the Defendant was merely

entrusted with the task of looking after the lots D1, D3 and E, for and on

behalf of his two sisters. Instead of using the words “wr.kak” or

“;shd.kak”, which indicate a clearer intention of renouncing whatever

the interest he might have had over the property at that point of time,

Barlin Perera had used the word “n,d.kak”, in entrusting the Defendant

with the responsibility of looking after the property. The said intention

of Barlin Perera attributed to his act of asking the Defendant to

“n,d.kak” is clearly manifests from his act of gifting each of the

subdivided lots to all of his three children, instead of gifting same as

one contiguous land to one of them or particularly to the Defendant,

who was already managing it under his permission.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

31

This consideration is therefore more in line with intention of

Barlin Perera of making the subdivision of the land and gifting his

children with same. It is also relevant to note that having owned several

other properties to make an equitable distribution of wealth among all

his three children, there is no other probable reason other than the one

referred to above in order to explain the conduct of Barlin Perera, in

relation to this particular property. Similarly, there is no justifiable

reason that can be attributed to the act of Barlin Perera as to why he had

undertaken an extra effort to subdivide the land through a surveyor at a

significant cost and thereafter gift those individual subdivided lots to all

of his children, when he had the more convenient option of gifting the

land in its entirety to one of them, as it existed at that particular point of

time.

Obviously, the two sisters of the Defendant would have been

made aware of this arrangement their father had put in place to manage

their share of property through the Defendant even before its

subdivision was made. Hence, mere entrustment of the property to the

Defendant does not indicate that he was given exclusive rights over that

property to the detriment of his other sibling’s rights. The Defendant’s

contention of the failure of his two sisters to possess their respective lots

no sooner they were gifted with same, is based on the proposition that

immediately after the deeds of gift were executed, his two sisters should

have commenced possessing same, at least by fencing off the

boundaries they shared with lot D2, owned by the Defendant.

When one considers certain cultural traditions and practices of

our society, it is not unusual for the two young females, who still are

under their father’s guardianship, for showing some hesitation and

reluctance in asserting their newly conferred rights over the respective

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

32

lots, no sooner they were gifted with title to same. It was noted earlier

on in this judgment that our Courts have considered claims of

prescription by one member of a family against the others with some

circumspection and accepted such claims only after considering their

validity against the backdrop of the nature of their relationship, whilst

being alive to the prevailing social and cultural practices in the society.

At times, the Courts have preferred not to draw the presumption of

ouster, after evaluating the nature of the relationship of such a claimant,

taking cognisance of such social norms and realities.

In applying that assessment criterion to the instant appeal, it is

observed that not only the two daughters of Barlin Perera, the Defendant

also, in accordance with the prevailing cultural norms and family

values, had accepted his father’s possession of the land with his head

bowed down, despite harbouring an undisclosed intention in his mind

to possess the property in its entirety all by himself, even before the

deeds of gift were executed. Thus, when considered in the light of such

social and cultural norms, it is highly probable that Barlin Perera had

permissive possession of all four subdivided lots after 1967 on behalf of

his three children until his death in 1969. The evidence of the Defendant

also indicate that said permissive possession had continued even after

Barlin Perera’s death in 1969.

There is no evidence that the relationship between the three

siblings was strained or of any hostility that had erupted between them

at any point of time, forcing them to part their ways upon strained

family ties. Thus, in the mind of Juliet Perera, the Defendant had merely

succeeded to the responsibility of managing the land on her behalf, in

place of her late father. Under these circumstances, the culturally

expected a role of the eldest male child of a family in relation to his

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

33

younger unmarried sister, especially after their father’s death, would

undoubtedly have contributed to the brotherly trust that had been

placed in the Defendant by his sister. In these circumstances, it is

reasonable to infer that Juliet Perera would have assumed that the

Defendant, being her eldest brother, would not act in any manner

whatsoever against her interests and continue to possess and manage

lots D3 and E on her behalf as he did when their father was alive.

It is observed that the Defendant, although claimed that he had

possession (“nqla;sh”) of lots D3 and E since 1954 but opted to keep his

intention to possess same, against the ownership of Juliet Perera, to

himself without disclosing it. He did not at least once indicate his

intention to hold possession of the same against the interests of his

sister. Eventually, he was compelled to make his secret intention

declared in public, when the Plaintiff instituted the instant actions,

seeking declarations of her title to those two lots. The continuation of

permissive possession over the said two lots after the death of their

father by the Defendant could easily be inferred in the absence of any

significant change in the circumstances relating to nature of his

possession. The Defendant admits that he is aware Juliet Perera had

made several transfers through several notarially executed instruments

over the said two lots, but he was content with merely to continue to be

in “nqla;sh” regardless of such transfers. Hence, it is clear that at no point

Juliet Perera was made aware that the permissive possession of the

Defendant had turned adverse to her interests.

This factor, namely the knowledge on the part of Juliet Perera of

her brother’s change of character in relation to possession, being an

integral component of the requirement of the starting point of an

adverse possession, thus remained an obscure factor. The knowledge of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

34

Juliet Perera that her brother is holding the property against her rights is

a must for the prescriptive claim laid out by the Defendant to succeed

by satisfying the component of her acquiescence. This is evident from

the judgment of Appu Naide v Heen Menika et al (1948) 51 NLR 63,

which was pronounced in relation to an instance where a Kandyan, who

had permitted his sisters who have contracted Deega marriages but

nonetheless to possess their share of the land for a long period of time.

The Court held that he cannot be permitted to deny their rights due to

his acquiescence. In delivering the said judgment Basnayaka J (as he was

then), had quoted the following statement of Thesiger L.J., from the

judgment of De Bussche v. Alt (1878) L. R. 8 Ch. D. 286 (at p. 314), in

defining the doctrine of acquiescence. It is stated by Thesiger L.J in the

said judgment that;

"If a person having a right, and seeing another person about to

commit, or in the course of committing an act infringing upon

that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the

person committing the act, and who might otherwise have

abstained from it, to believe that he assents to its being committed,

he cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act…".

In my view, due to the factors that are enumerated above, the last

of the probabilities referred to earlier on this segment, namely the

probability of Juliet Perera’s acquiescence to the Defendant’s possession

adverse to her interests after the death of their father is therefore

reduced to a mere probability, especially in the absence of any

knowledge on the part of Juliet Perera about the Defendant’s intention to

hold the property in adverse possession against her rights and her belief

that he held the property in permissive possession.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

35

The judgment of Perera v Perera (1897) 2 NLR 370, deals with

almost an identical factual situation that arose in the instant appeal.

This judgment refers to an instance where a father had donated a parcel

of land to his daughter immediately before her marriage. Having

accepted the gift, she had handed it back to her father for safe keeping.

She never entered into possession of the land donated, but her father

continued to possess same and let it to tenants who paid him rent and

repaired the buildings on it during the donee's lifetime, who continued

to be on the best of terms with her father. When she died, her father

claimed that he had acquired prescriptive title to the said land. Lawrie

ACJ was of the view (at p. 371) that although the father was given the

deed and continued to possess the land “… he certainly at first possessed

in trust for his daughter as her caretaker and agent. That title to possess must

be held to have continued until by some overt act the possession for the

daughter was changed into a possession on a title adverse to her.” The only

important factor that is dissimilar to the factual position in the instant

appeals to that of Perera v Perera (supra) is the fact that donee had

expressly entrusted the land along with the deed of gift back to her

father, whereas in this instance, it had to be inferred from the conduct of

the parties upon the evidence presented before the trial Courts. Since

the probabilities factor weigh in favour of the Plaintiff in support of her

contention that the Defendant only had permissive possession of lots

D3 and E from Juliet Perera, said deficiency in her case as to the nature

of possession of the Defendant had over the land, could be

supplemented with a reasonable inference drawn in favour of

permissive possession, particularly in the absence of any evidence

adduced by the Defendant to indicate a contrary position, except for his

repetitive assertion that he was in “nqla;sh ”.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

36

In view of the items of evidence referred to above, I hold that the

Defendant is deemed to be a licensee of Juliet Perera, who entered into

occupation and possession of lots D3 and E, upon permissive

possession. The said conclusion was reached by applying the test,

which formulated by Lord Denning and applied in Errington v

Errington and Woods (1952) 1 KB 290, in order to determine whether a

party is a tenant or a licensee. This is the test adopted by Gratiaen J, in

the judgment of Swami Sivgnananda v The Bishop of Kandy (1953) 55

NLR 130, in relation to an instance where a person was permitted to

occupy a premises on an agreement to sell but failed to complete the

purchase as agreed, refused to vacate when the owners have sold the

premises to the plaintiff and taken up the position that he is a tenant

and is entitled to protection of the provisions of the Rent Restriction

Act. Gratiaen J adopted Lord Denning’s test to determine the said

dispute (at p. 132) and reproduced same as follows; “… if the

circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was intended

was that the occupier should be granted a personal privilege, with no interest in

the land, he will be held to be a licensee only”.

In the above context, I think the time is ripe to consider another

facet of the contention advanced by the learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff. During the course of his submissions, learned Counsel made

an attempt to present the status of the Defendant and his sisters by

referring to them as co-owners. With his attempt to term the litigating

parties to the instant appeal as co-owners, learned Counsel sought to

apply an important principle of law applicable to such co-owners,

namely when one or more of them opted to lay out a claim of

acquisition of prescriptive title over the co-owned property or a part of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

37

it, against the rights of the others, such claim must precede with an

overt act.

In Maduwanwela v Ekneligoda (supra), having rejected the

contentions that if a person allows another out of charity to occupy his

house, the Courts are bound to presume that occupation is possession

and that the license to occupy means license to possess ut dominus,

Bonser CJ had laid down the principle that a person(at p. 215), who is let

into occupation of property as a tenant or a licensee, must be deemed to

continue to occupy that property on the same capacity in which he was

initially admitted, until by some overt act he manifests his intention to

occupy it in another capacity and no secret act will avail to change the

nature of his occupation. This principle of law was acted upon by Lord

Mac Naghten in the Privy Council judgment of Nauda Marikkar v

Mohammadu (1903) 7 NLR 91, in rejecting a claim of prescription of the

added defendant, who had “never got rid of character of agent”. His

Lordship, in delivering the Privy Council judgment of Corea v Iseris

Appuhamy (1911) 15 NLR 65, had reiterated the same principle once

more by stating that (at p.78), it is not possible for a co-owner “… to put

an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing short of

ouster or something equivalent to ouster could bring about that result.” This

principle of law was pronounced and acted upon in relation to

instances where a claim of prescription is laid out against a co-owned

property by one of the co-owners. The judgment of Basnayaka CJ, in

Gunawardene v Samarakoon et al (supra), is an authority relied on by

the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff, in support of his contention of

overt act is needed to change the character of possession. This judgment

too had followed the principle of law that the possession of one co-

owner is the possession of the other co-owners and such a possession

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

38

cannot be ended by any secret intention, entertained in the mind of the

possessing co-owner.

In a recent judgment of this Court ( Chaminda Abeykoon v

Anthony Fernando and Others SC Appeal No. 54A/2008 – decided on

02.10.2018), after undertaking an analysis of the judicial precedents that

were pronounced on the presumption of ouster, especially in relation to

a claim of prescription by a licensee, Prasanna Jayawardena J had stated

that “ … the requirement that the possession of one co-owner is the possession

of the other co-owners and that an overt act in the nature of ouster must occur

to demonstrate a change of the character of that possession and start running of

prescription in favour of one co-owner, applies with equal force to instances

where a licensee or an agent possesses a property in a subordinate character. In

such instances, an overt act must occur to demonstrate change in the character

of that possession and start the running of prescription in favour of the

erstwhile licensee or agent”, after rejecting the submission of the licensee

that, “the requirement of an overt act applies only in the case of claims of

prescription between co-owners.”

This is because, his Lordship added, “it is well-established principle

of law that, as long as a person possesses a property as the licensee or agent of

the owner, that person cannot acquire prescriptive title to that property.

Instead, the running of prescription can commence only upon the licensee or

agent committing some “overt act” which demonstrates that he has cast aside

his subordinate character and is now possessing the property adverse to or

independent of the owner of the property and without acknowledging any right

of the owner of the property. The overt act is required to give [ or deem to give]

notice to the owner that his erstwhile licensee or agent is, from that time

onwards, claiming to possess the property adverse to or independent of the

owner.”

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

39

Thus, the said judgement treats a licensee, who claims acquisition

of prescriptive title to a land, in the same status of a co-owner who had

laid out a prescriptive claim to the co-owned land and as such he too

must establish the change of his former character of a licensee to a that

of one who possess adversely by establishing an overt act. Whilst in

respectful agreement with the said pronouncement of Jayawardena J and,

in view of the considerations referred to above, I am of the opinion that

it is appropriate to apply the said principle in relation to the instant

appeals as well, since the Defendant too had entered into possession of

lots D3 and E with permission of his sister as a licensee. I am fortified in

this view as Lawrie ACJ in Perera v Perera (supra) stated (at p. 371) that

“… he certainly at first possessed in trust for his daughter as her caretaker and

agent. That title to possess must be held to have continued until by some overt

act the possession for the daughter was changed into a possession on a title

adverse to her.”

In view of the considerations referred to above and in view of the

fact that relative probabilities favour a conclusion that the Defendant

had initially entered into possession of lots D3 and E, with permission

of Juliet Perera, it is relevant to consider whether the Defendant, by an

overt act, had shed the said character of permissive possession at a

subsequent point of time, by which his sister was put on notice that the

permissive nature of possession of her brother over the disputed land

had turned into a different character of possession, in which her rights

over the disputed land are challenged.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant, in support of his plea of

prescription, have relied heavily on the uncontroverted fact that it was

his client who rented out the house standing on lot D3 and exclusively

appropriated its rent for himself. He further contended the fact that

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

40

none of his sisters ever came to possess their respective lots nor did they

demand their due share of the rent because the Defendant had

possessed the two lots adverse to their title. Learned Counsel further

submitted that when these factors are considered in the backdrop of the

Defendant’s solitary act of instituting action to evict a defaulting tenant,

in itself would indicate clear denial of any acknowledgement of his

sister’s title, and also demonstrates to Court that he was clearly in

possession of lots D3 and E, adverse to the title of the Plaintiff and of

her predecessors. Hence, it was submitted by the learned Counsel for

the Defendant that the High Court of Civil Appeal, in allowing his

appeals, had correctly arrived at the conclusion that the Defendant is

entitled to declaration of his prescriptive title over lots. D3 and E.

This contention indicates the degree of reliance placed by the

Defendant on the level of control he claims to have had over the

“house” and the income derived from it, in order to strengthen his

prescriptive claim over lots D3 and E. Even though the Defendant had

failed to convince the trial Courts that he had established a prescriptive

claim by advancing the said contention, he was successful with the

High Court of Civil Appeal. In view of the submissions made by the

learned Counsel for the Plaintiff to convince this Court that the

appellate Court had erred in allowing the Defendant’s appeals, it is

necessary to consider the available evidence that are directly relevant

on this point.

What is relevant in the present context is to consider whether

there was an overt act. Admittedly the Defendant’s father had owned

several other properties, in addition to the property under dispute, and

his children were either gifted with or inherited their share of same

since his death. It is not disputed that none of them lived on their

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

41

respective lots of the land in dispute but have settled on their inherited

or gifted individual properties, in the vicinity of their ancestral home. It

is in this backdrop only the contention of the Defendant on renting out

and collecting rent should be evaluated.

The survey plan (P1), that made the disputed land into four

subdivided lots, was prepared in 1967. It indicates that before the

subdivision, a house and a hut were already stood on lots D and E.

After the subdivision of lot D into D1, D2 and D3, house that was

initially on lot D, had shifted to the subdivided lot D3, whereas the hut

too had shifted to lot D2. Lots D1 and E had no buildings on them and

remained as bare plots of land. There were few coconut trees but no

clear evidence as to their distribution over the four lots.

It is stated by the Defendant that, at the time of his father’s death

in 1969, said house was occupied by his father’s tenant, but acting on

his father’s directions, its rent was collected by him. After his father’s

death, the Defendant had continued to collect rent and, had rented out

the house to each succeeding tenant, as and when it became vacant. He

asserts that its rent was appropriated all by himself and no share or

produce of the land was ever given to any of his two sisters and nor did

they demand any. This claim was accepted by the High Court of Civil

Appel. The Defendant also states that after the execution of deeds, their

father had fenced off the entire property, irrespective of the subdivision,

installed a gate and therefore the land, though subdivided into four lots,

continued to be possessed as one contiguous land.

In instituting action to evict his defaulting tenant in 1985, the

Defendant described in his plaint (P10) that he had rented a “house” to

Simion Perera and his tenant had fallen into arrears of rent. The reference

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

42

to a single house is significant in the context of present appeals. The

Defendant also had relied on the said eviction proceedings to establish

that he only took any initiative to evict overholding tenant Simion

Perera, in support of his exclusive and adverse possession.

During his evidence in case No. 6901/L, the Defendant had

however stated that he had rented out a “building” (f.dvke.s,a,la) that

stood on lot D3 to Simion Perera in 1970. He also asserts that there was a

“small house” (fmdä f.hla) on lot D2 as well at that time. Thus, the

Defendant had thereby created an ambiguity as to the “house” he had

rented out to Simion Perera, since it appears from his own evidence that

the Defendant had rented out only a “building” on lot D3, while there is

“house” standing on his own lot D2. In case No. 6906/L too the

Defendant did not specifically state which of these two houses that he

had given out on rent to Simion Perera. The trial against Simion Perera

had proceeded ex parte and with the issuance of its decree, the fiscal had

placed the Defendant in possession of the property upon execution of

the writ of possession. The Defendant then had added that after his

tenant was evicted by the fiscal, he had demolished the “building” that

stood on that land.

In his plaint, although the Defendant had averred that “a house”

had been rented out to Simion Perera, he made no refence in the plaint to

include or exclude the “hut” that stood on lot D2 with the “house” on

lot D3 or to the fact there were two buildings used for residential

purposes on the land. It is evident from the Defendant’s evidence before

the trial Courts, that when he rented out “a building” to Simion Perera in

1970, there was another “small house” already in existence on his own

land, namely lot D2.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

43

Thus, it is clear that the “hut”, that existed in 1967 on Lot D2, had

transformed itself into a “small house” by 1970. How did this

transformation take place?

The Defendant himself offers a clarification to this

transformation. The relevant section of evidence adduced by the

Defendant in this regard is as follows:-

“ m%( mshd 1969 oS Tmamqj ,shkfldg ;uqka ysi kjd tlÕjqKd

m%( úhoï lf<a ljqo@

W( ;d;a;d úhoï l<d' uu;a úhoï l<d'”

Thus, the evidence clearly points out that there were two houses

standing on the property by 1969. One put up by his father and the

other by the Defendant. The distinct reference to “my house” (“uf.a

f.a”) in his evidence is important. The Defendant, with that reference

makes a distinction of the ownership to the two houses that stood on

that land. His evidence indicates that, of these two houses, one was put

up by his father and the other put up by him, of course with financial

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

44

assistance of his father. However, the Defendant maintained

throughout the trials that there was only one house on that land and

that is the one built by his father, and belonged to his sister, as he had

laid a claim of acquiring prescriptive title to them. Since the Defendant

had failed to present a clearer picture through his oral evidence as to

from which of the two houses/buildings that he sought to evict Simion

Perera, this is an important factor, which could only be resolved upon

examination of the available documentary evidence, particularly the

report of the fiscal (P4) filed in Court, after Simion Perera’s eviction from

the property.

The fiscal who visited the land to execute writ of possession had

noted there were in fact two “buildings” (“f.dvke.s,s”) standing on it

and Simion Perera operated a fabric printing business, whilst occupying

both these buildings. Therefore, the existence of two houses or

buildings on that land is a fact confirmed by an independent source, the

fiscal report (V4), and that too upon a document tendered by the

Defendant himself during the trial. The schedule to the said plaint (P10)

indicates that the Defendant had described the land on which the said

“house” stood on, with the identical description as given in the

partition decree. He had wilfully ignored the subsequent subdivision

made in 1967, in describing the residential premises in the plaint.

Hence, schedule to the plaint does not provide any assistance to

determine this issue. Simion Perera was evicted from both these

buildings on 02.02.1987 by the fiscal and the Defendant was placed in

possession of the entire land, which included lots D1, D2, D3 and E.

Since the schedule to the plaint indicated a larger land, the fiscal may

have evicted Simion Perera from both these buildings that stood on the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

45

land described in the schedule, despite the fact that there was refence

only to a single house in the plaint.

The Defendant had thereafter demolished the said buildings

before the District Court had restored the tenant Simion Perera back in

possession of the property on 01.04.1991. This was after the Court had

vacated its ex parte decree on 17.03.1986, when Simion Perera had

successfully purged his default before that Court. The 2nd fiscal report

restoring Simion Perera in possession (V5), indicates that except for a

masonry structure that supported an overhead water tank, there were

no other buildings that stood on the property at that point of time. The

fact of demolishing a building standing on another’s land could, in

ordinary circumstance, could be an instance of an overt act by a

claimant of prescriptive title. However, in relation to the instant

appeals, with regard to the Defendant’s act of demolition, Juliet Perera

may have been under the impression that the said act was to prevent

Simion Perera from re-occupying the land, since it was after the

defaulting tenant was successfully evicted on an action instituted with

her concurrence. In the absence of any evidence pointing to the

contrary, the fact of demolition of the buildings would not support the

Defendant’s claim of adverse possession.

The Defendant preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal (CA

No. 139/89(F) against the said order of the District Court, by which the

original Court had set aside its ex parte decree and allowed Simion Perera

to file answer. At the hearing before the appellate Court, the Defendant,

being the appellant, was not present nor was represented. On

31.07.1998, the Court of Appeal, upon consideration of merits of the

appeal, held in favour of the Defendant and decided to allow his

appeal. Lesley Perera who substituted in the said application after his

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

46

father’s demise, had sought Special Leave to Appeal from this Court in

S.C. Spl L.A. No. 170/98, against the said judgment of the Court of

Appeal. On 08.12.1998, this Court refused to grant leave and dismissed

Simion Perera’s application now prosecuted by his son. Consequent to

this dismissal, the Defendant had executed writ of possession on

14.06.1999, once again to evict said Lesley Perera, who continued to

occupy the disputed property after passing of his father, Simion Perera.

The fiscal report (V3) indicates that by this time there existed a “small

house” with an asbestos roof on that property, in which Lesley Perera

was operating a business of a service station for three wheelers. The

Defendant was quieted in possession by the Court officer for the second

time on 14.06.1999, over lots D1, D3 and E, upon eviction of Lesly Perera,

who by this time was in possession on behalf of Gamini Ponweera, as his

lessee and the Plaintiff.

What is important to determine in this context is, that which of

these two houses that existed in 1970 on the disputed land, that had in

fact been rented out to Simion Perera, as averred in the said plaint. Since

the Defendant relied heavily on that factor in support of his prescriptive

claim, then he must counter the Plaintiff’s evidence that Juliet Perera had

concurred the institution of the said action. The Defendant was silent on

this specific assertion throughout his evidence. As already noted, the

evidence that the Defendant had presented before the trial Courts

reveals that there was only one house standing on the land as indicated

in the survey plan P1, and he had given that house on rent to Simion

Perera. But his evidence on the number of houses is self-contradictory as

having asserted that his father had constructed a house after acquiring

title to the land in 1954, and he also had built a house on his own on lot

D2. The Defendant should have cleared the resultant ambiguity as to

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

47

the house that he claims to have given on rent and should also have

clearly established that in addition to the “small house” on D2, he also

had rented out and collected rent of the house, which stood on lot D3, if

that fact was to accrue to his benefit.

When he restricted the scope of the eviction proceedings to a

single house, instead of two houses that had in fact been occupied by

Simion Perera at that particular point of time, it is equally probable that

he did so, in relation to the house standing on lot D2, being his own

property, instead of the house on lot D3, which belonged to his sister. In

instituting action by the Defendant, this omission of the plaint cannot be

attributed to a mere oversight, since in his plaint he had described the

land on which that particular “house” stood, as a land consisting of

only lots D and E, which is in line with the description given in the

partition decree. This he did when in fact lot D had been subdivided

into D1, D2 and D3 in 1967, as per the schedule to his own deed of gift

and that house now stood on lots D3 and E. Referring to this

misdescription of the property, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant’s

said deceitful act, had resulted in illegally dispossessing her from lots

D3 and E, to which she had valid title.

In the same context, another aspect of the Defendant’s case in

support of his prescriptive title should be considered. It is correct that

the Defendant had rented out the house and collected its rent and he

alone instituted action seeking the eviction of his defaulting tenant.

However, the Courts have considered and evaluated such claims

against the backdrop of social norms and cultural practices and, at

times, preferred not to draw the presumption of ouster in favour of a

claimant, who raises a plea of prescriptive title on such factors, by

adopting a more a pragmatic approach.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

48

De Sampayo J, considering the nature of adverse possession of the

plaintiff, in Tillekeratne et al. v Bastian et al. (1918) 21 NLR 12, had

observed (at p. 28), “While a co-owner may without any inference of

acquiescence in an adverse claim allow such natural produce as the fruits of

trees to be taken by the other co-owners, the aspect of this will not be the same

in the case where valuable minerals are taken for long series of years without

any division in kind of money.”

In Abdul Majeed v Ummu Zaneera et al. (supra) De Silva J stated

(at p.371) “Our social customs and family ties have some bearing on the

possession of immovable property owned in common and should not be lost

sight of. Many of our people consider it unworthy to alienate ancestral lands to

strangers. Those who are in more affluent circumstances permit their less

fortunate relatives to take the income of ancestral property owned in common.

But that does not mean that they intend to part with their rights in those lands

permanently. Very often if the income derived from such a property is not high

the co-owner or co-owners who reside on it are permitted to enjoy the whole of

it by the other co-owners who live far away. But such a co-owner should not be

penalised for his generous disposition by converting the permissive possession

of the recipient of his benevolence to adverse possession”.

In relation to the instant appeal, as referred to earlier on, it is

established by the evidence of the Defendant by producing the survey

plan that there was a house standing on lot D3 in 1967. Other than the

house, there was nothing on lots D1, and E that would yield an income.

The land was located in an urban area and is therefore more suited for

residential or commercial use rather than utilising same for agricultural

purpose. There was no evidence as to the presence of any valuable

minerals. Only income said to have been derived from the land is the

rent from the two buildings. The Defendant, although claimed to have

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

49

utilised the rent form the house, did not offer to mention the amount in

his evidence nor did he produce any rent receipts. He did not state that

he attorned after his father’s death as landlord of Simion Perera.

The Defendant’s father received title to the land in 1954 after a

partition action. The house that stood on lot D3 was admittedly built by

his father. However, the Defendant did not claim that he made any

improvement to that house nor had maintained it. In the preceding

paragraphs, the ambiguity as to the identity of the ‘house’, the

Defendant had given on rent was considered in detail. If the house he

had rented out is the one stood on lot D3, his conduct in relation to that

house could easily be understood, when considered in the light of the

fact that he only had permissible possession of the house and therefore

did not possess same ut dominus. In the absence of oral evidence by the

Defendant as to the specific amount of rent he received from the house;

it could well be that the rent was not a significant amount for his sister

to demand her share. Hence, the mere fact that she did not demand her

share of rent, in itself does not accrue to the benefit of the Defendant, in

support of his plea of prescription.

These two factors, i.e., the fact of renting out a house and

appropriating its rent, were the primary factors that had been relied

upon by the Defendant, in support of his claim of prescription. Despite

the rejection of the said claim of acquisition of prescriptive title of the

Defendant by the trial Courts, the High Court of Civil Appeal, accepted

the Defendant’s said claim in stating that the “Defendant had specifically

stated in evidence that he did not give the produce from the land to his sisters.

It is in evidence that he had taken the rent paid by Simion Perera entirely to his

benefit”. In my view, due to the reasons stated in the preceding

paragraphs, in which these factors were considered in detail, they fall

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

50

far short of required degree of proof due to their ambiguity. In the

absence of any evidence of an ouster, the permissive character of the

Defendant’s possession over lots D3 and E that had persisted

throughout the period 1969 to 1988 had not lost its initial character of

acknowledgement of a right existing in Juliet Perera. Hence, the

Defendant’s permissive possession could not be considered as proof of

possession by “a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant …” in

which an acknowledgement of a right existing in another person would

fairly and naturally be inferred. Dias Abeysinghe v Dias Abeysinghe

and Two Others 34 CLW 60 held: “where the co-owners are members of one

family very strong evidence of exclusive possession is necessary to

establish prescription”. Soertz SPJ, in Simpson v Lebbe (1947) 48 NLR 112

(at p. 112) in relation to prescription among co-owners insisted that “…

very clear and strong evidence of an ouster and of adverse possession is called

for”. In the judgment of Gunasekera v Tissera and Others (1994) 3 Sri

L.R. 245, this requirement was emphasised by Mark Fernando J, citing a

series of judicial precedents.

There is no evidence that had been presented before the trial

Courts, which even tends to suggest that the Defendant did something

positive after their father’s death to indicate to Juliet Perera that he

possessed the two lots D3 and E in a manner adverse to her interests,

other than the evidence relating to the Defendant’s act of renting out the

house, collecting and appropriating its rent for himself. The Defendant

admits that he never ousted his sister from lot D3 and E, when he said

that he merely continued with the arrangement his father had set up

even after the latter's demise. In my assessment these items of evidence

do not justify a reasonable inference that there was an overt act by

which the character of possession held by the Defendant was changed

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

51

any time after 1969, which notified to his sister of same. The institution

of action to evict the tenant Simion Perera too could not accrue to the

benefit of the Defendant, in view of the evidence of the Plaintiff that

had been referred to above.

I accordingly hold, following the judgment of Perera v Perera

(supra), that the requirement of ouster that had been insisted upon by

the superior Courts in relation to co-owned property, is equally

applicable even to instances where a claimant of prescriptive title, who

was initially allowed into a property, firstly due to familial relationship

as in the instant appeals, and secondly because he was allowed to

possess the property only upon his acknowledgement of a right, either

expressly or impliedly, existing in the other member of family, against

whom the prescriptive claim is made.

The other aspect of the Defendant’s contention, that whether the

possession of the land by the Defendant for well over four decades, in

itself is sufficient to a decree in his favour, requires consideration at this

stage.

If one were to assume that there was no evidence at all to justify

an inference that the Defendant was in permissive possession of his

sister Juliet Perera, would he still be able to obtain a decree in his favour

under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, solely on the basis that he

had possessed lots D3 and E for over four decades?

When the evidence of the Defendant is considered as a whole, it

is evident that his claim of prescription is primarily based on the

possession of lots D3 and E for a very long period, which had exceeded

a period of over four decades. Understandably, both Counsel for the

Defendant had placed heavy reliance of this factor as well before this

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

52

Court, in defending the conclusions reached by the High Court of Civil

Appeal to allow both his appeals.

As already indicated, the period of four decades commencing

from 1954 to 1999, would be considered in this judgment after dividing

same into two parts, based on the reasoning of the High Court of Civil

Appeal. The first part, which is currently under consideration, covers

the period commencing from 1954 to 1988, the year Juliet Perera

transferred her title to a total outsider for the first time. The other part

covers the period from 1988 to 1999, the year in which the Plaintiff was

evicted by an order of Court, which shall be considered in detail, in the

latter part of this judgment.

It is correct to state that there are judicial precedents that

supports the position that, in certain circumstances, the possession of a

parcel of land over a very long time might justify the drawing of the

presumption of ouster. I shall refer to a few of them, which indicate the

underlying rationale for adopting such an approach. In the full bench

decision of Odiris et al v Mendis et al (1910) 13 NLR 309, Hutchinson CJ

held that “… the first plaintiff remained in sole possession of B and C for more

than thirty years after the expiration of the six years mentioned in the voucher.

I think that it is the reasonable conclusion from these facts that he disputed the

defendants' title to B and C at the end of the six years, and has disputed it ever

since, and it is too late-now for them to assert it. In his plaint he claimed B and

C by prescriptive title; and although there was no issue as to prescription, I

think that, after such a long period of adverse possession since the term fixed in

the voucher, he is not precluded from now disputing the defendants' title.”

In the judgment of Rajapakse and Others v Hendrick Singho and

Others (1959) 61 NLR 32, Basnayaka CJ was of the view that “ … the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

53

evidence that the defendants since the death of Paulis in 1922, were not only in

occupation of the land but also took its produce to the exclusion of the plaintiffs

and their predecessors in title, and gave them no share of the produce, paid

them no share of the profits, nor any rent, and did not act from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in them would fairly and naturally be

inferred, is overwhelming.”

Similarly, in the judgment of Angela Fernando v Devadeepthi

Fernando and Others (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 188, Weerasuriya J, following the

reasoning of Tillekeratne v Bastian (supra), observed that (at p. 194)

“ouster does not necessarily involve the actual application of force. The

presumption of ouster is drawn in certain circumstances when exclusive

possession has been so long continued that it is not reasonable to call upon the

party who relies on it to adduce evidence that at a specific point of time in the

distant past there was in fact a denial of the rights of the other co-owners.” His

lordship thereupon had reiterated the principle enunciated in

Tillekeratne v Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12, by stating that it “… recognises

an exception to the general rule and permits adversity of possession to be

presumed in the presence of special circumstances additional to the fact of

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for the requisite period.”

In the full bench judgment of Tillekeratne v Bastian (supra),

Bertram CJ, in relation to such an instance, posed the question “if it was

not originally adverse, at what point it may be taken to have become so?” and

proceeded to answer same with the statement (at p.23) that “… it is open

to the Court, from lapse of time in conjunction with the circumstances of the

case, to presume that a possession originally that of a co-owner has since

become adverse.” In stating thus, his Lordship was alive to the principle

of law that had been laid down by Marshall CJ in Mac Clung v Ross

(1820) 5 Wheaton 116, that “a silent possession, accompanied with no act

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

54

which can amount to an ouster or give notice to his co-tenant that his

possession is adverse, ought not to be construed into an adverse possession;

mere possession, however exclusive or long continued, if silent, cannot give one

co-tenant in possession title as against another co-tenant.”

In the full bench judgment of Alwis v Perera (1919) 21 NLR 321,

Bertram CJ, reiterated the principle of law which was expounded in the

case of Tillekeratne v. Bastian, (supra) 21 NLR 12 that “where it is shown

that people have been in possession of land for a very considerable length of

time, that fact, taken in conjunction with the other circumstances of the case,

may justify a Court in presuming that the possession which originated in one

manner, as, for example, by permission, may have changed its character, and

that at some point it became adverse possession.” The underlying rationale

of this principle is explained by De Silva J in Abdul Majeed v Ummu

Zaneera et al (supra, and at p. 372) with the statement that “the

presumption of ouster is drawn in certain circumstances, when the exclusive

possession has been so-long continued that it is not reasonable to call upon the

party who relies on it to adduce evidence that at a specific point of time in the

distant past, there was in fact a denial of the rights of other co-owners. The

duration of exclusive possession, being so long, it would not be practicable in

such a case to lead the evidence of persons who would be in a position to speak

from personal knowledge as to how the adverse possession commenced. Most of

the persons who had such knowledge may be dead or cannot be traced or are

incapable of giving evidence when the matter comes up for trial. In such a

situation it would be reasonable, in certain circumstances, to draw the

presumption of ouster.”

The Privy Council, in its judgment of Cadija Umma and another

v Don Manis Appu and Others (1938) 40 NLR392 considered the view

expressed by in Tillekeratne v Bastian (supra) on the parenthetical

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

55

clause of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. In the said judgment

Bertram CJ observed that “the parenthesis has no bearing on the meaning of

the words ' adverse title': it may henceforth be left out of account in the

discussion of the question". The Privy Council stated that “their Lordships

cannot accept this dictum of the learned Chief Justice”. Their Lordships,

however, were not inclined to describe “under what conditions an agent or

co-owner can be heard to say that his possession has been an ouster of his

principal or co-sharer” as it “is a matter which need not here be examined.”

In Abdul Majeed v Ummu Zaneera et al (supra), having referred

to the phrase “with the circumstances of the case” from the judgment of

Bertram CJ in Tillekeratne v Bastian (supra), HNG Fernando J (as he was

then) was of the view that “ read out of their context, these observations may

tend to support the view that adversity may be presumed from mere long

continued and exclusive possession” and therefore holds that “ the so-called

presumption of ouster is not to be applied arbitrarily, but only if proved

circumstances tends to show , firstly the probability of an ouster, and secondly

the difficulty or impossibility adducing proof of the ‘ouster’. If the

circumstances justify the opinion that possession must have become adverse at

some time, a judge is not in reality presuming an ouster, he rather gives effect

to his opinion despite the absence of proof of ouster which a co-owner would

ordinarily be required to adduce.”

Referring to the facts of the appeal before his Lordship, Fernando J

also stated that “ … the 13th defendant undoubtedly had undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession of the property in the sense contemplate by section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance, for (in the language of the parenthesis in section

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

56

3) his possession was “ unaccompanied by payment of rent, by performance of

any service of duty, or by any other act from which a right existing in any

other person would fairly and naturally be inferred”. However, his Lordship

was of the view that “… a person is not entitled to a decree under section 3

by virtue of such possession alone; the section requires the proof of a second

element, namely that the possession must be “title adverse to or independent of

that of the claimant or the plaintiff in such action”.

Senanayake J, in Karunawathie and two others v Gunadasa (1996)

2 Sri L.R. 246 stated “in considering whether or not a presumption of ouster

should be drawn by reason of long continued possession alone of the property

owned in common, it is relevant to consider (a) the income derived from the

property (b) the value of the property (c) the relationship of the co-owners and

where they reside in relation to the situation of the corpus”. His Lordship,

adopting the same line of reasoning as Weerasuiya J did in Angela

Fernando v Devadeepthi Fernando and Others (supra), had thereupon

proceeded to hold that “in the instant case, the income from the Coconut

and other trees would have been considerable and income from the Rubber

plantation would have been high, this was a valuable piece of property and the

4th Defendant-Appellant was the only person who was residing in the corpus

and the corpus was fenced on three sides which establish the exclusive

possession. There was not an iota of evidence that the Plaintiffs had plucked

even a Coconut or Jak fruit or that he received even a Coconut husk from the

4th Defendant. If the income that the property yields is considerable and the

whole of it is appropriated by one co-owner during a long period it is a

circumstance which would weigh heavily in favour of adverse possession on the

part of the co-owner.”

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

57

Thus, it is clear that the fact of being in possession of a particular

parcel of land for a substantially a long period of time, in itself would

not accrue to the benefit of a claimant, who had set up a claim of

acquisition of prescriptive title to such land under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance. In addition to long possession, such a claimant

must also establish “the presence of special circumstances additional to the

fact of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for the requisite period” in

inviting a Court to draw the presumption of ouster.

Since it was for the Defendant to establish the presence of special

circumstances additional to the establishment of the fact of undisturbed

and uninterrupted possession for the requisite period, it would be

relevant at this juncture to consider the judicial precedents that deal

with the nature of his burden of proof in this particular perspective. The

judicial precedents referred to above does not justify drawing the

presumption of ouster upon mere assertion of the Defendant that “I

possessed” the land in dispute even for a long period of time.

Moncreiff J, after undertaking a review of the judicial precedents

on the nature of possession as required under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance, had identified following applicable principles

and listed them in Kirihamy Muhandirama v Dingiri Appu (1903) 6

NLR 197, (at p. 200);

“It would appear then that, in order that a person may avail

himself of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of

1871-

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

58

1. Possession must be shown from which a right in

another person cannot be fairly or naturally

inferred.

2. Possession required by the section must be

shown on the part of the party litigating or by

those under whom he claims.

3. The possession of those under whom the party

claims means possession by his predecessors in

title.

4. Judgment must be for a person who is a party to

the action and not for one who sets up the

possession of another person, who is neither his

predecessor in title nor a party to the action.”

In Sirajudeen v Abbas (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 365, at p.371, De Silva CJ

quoted from the text of Walter Pereira’s Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Ed, where

the learned author stated, following the judgment of Piyenis v Pedro 3

SCC 125, that “as regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statement of witnesses that the plaintiff “possessed” the land in dispute

for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of the

uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title by

prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts,

and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by the Court. It is

also necessary that definite acts of possession by particular individuals or

particular portions of land should be proved.”

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

59

Similar observations were made by Basnayaka CJ, in Hassan v

Romanishamy 66 CLW 112, that “mere statements of a witness, “I possessed

the land” or “we possessed the land” and “I planted plantain bushes and

vegetable” are not sufficient to entitle him to a decree under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance, …”.

The judgment of Juliana Hamine v Don Thomas (1957) 59 NLR

546, indicate that L.W. de Silva AJ was of the view that the plaintiff of

that case had failed to establish prescriptive title as his witness had,

apart from the use of the word possess, did not describe the manner of

his possession. The Court held that “such evidence is of no value where the

Court has to find a title by prescription” and quoted the Full Bench

judgment of Alwis v Perera (1919) 21 N L R 321, where Bertram C J,

emphasised that the trial judges should not confine themselves merely

to record the words of a witness who states that “I possessed” or “ We

possessed” or “We took the produce”, and should insist those words are

explained and exemplified.

The Defendant, during his evidence, repetitively asserted that he

had possession of the land since 1954. Having admitted that he is well

aware of the nature of possession he ought to have, in order to obtain a

decree in his favour under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the

Defendant had stated in evidence that even though he was aware that

his sister had executed several deeds over the lots D1, D3 and E, he did

not take any action as he was content with his “undisturbed”

possession over the two lots. This is the position he asserted in the

answer as well. He claimed that the Plaintiff nor her predecessors in

title ever possessed the two lots in respect of which declarations are

sought.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

60

But the body of evidence that had been presented by the parties

before trial Courts indicate that the said assertion of an undisturbed

possession by the Defendant is not supported at all. on the contrary,

they in fact point that possession of the disputed lots by the new owners

were ut dominus. With Gamini Ponweera acquiring title from Juliet Perera,

being a total outsider to the family, he had possessed at least lot D1 ut

dominus and thereby interrupting the Defendant’s claim of adverse

possession of lots D1, D3 and E. The actions of Gamini Ponweera and its

effects on the possession of the Defendant are considered further down

in this judgment whilst reviewing the validity of the findings of the

appellate Court that the Defendant had uninterrupted adverse

possession for ten years during the 11-year period of 1988 to 1999.

Thus, in view of the principles considered in the said judgments, I

hold that the, the Defendant, in asserting that he ‘possessed’ lots D3 and

E since 1954 in support of his prescriptive claim, should have been

explained and exemplified as to the exact nature of his possession, for

he is expected to eliminate any probable doubts or ambiguities as to the

presence of permissive nature of such possession, as contended by the

Plaintiff, through her witness. He should have established that his

possession of the said two lots satisfies “the presence of special

circumstances additional to the fact of undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession for the requisite period”. The Defendant had to establish that not

only he had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the property

unaccompanied by payment of rent, by performance of any service or

duty, or by any other act from which a right existing in another person

would fairly or naturally be inferred. HNG Fernando J (as he was then),

in Abdul Majeed v Ummu Zaneera et al (supra) stated (at p.377) that “

… a person is not entitled to a decree under section 3 of the Prescription

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

61

Ordinance by virtue of such possession alone; the section requires the proof of a

second element, namely that the possession must be ‘by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or the plaintiff in such action’… this is a

distinct and separate element emphasised by Bertram CJ in his judgment of

Tillekeratne v Bastian … ”.

Therefore, it is important for the Defendant to lay the foundation

for an objective assessment of his claim by placing sufficient evidence

before the trial Courts in support of the four issues he himself had

suggested on nature of possession and thereby inviting Court to make a

determination in his favour. He had particularly failed in fulfilling this

obligation and thus fell short of establishing the second element, as

stated in Abdul Majeed v Ummu Zaneera et al (supra), namely, that the

possession must be “title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or

the plaintiff in such action.” The Defendant is not entitled to any

concession of establishing this element, as it was well within his

knowledge as to the nature of possession he claims to have had since

1954. The observations of Fernando J in the same judgment to the effect

that “the duration of exclusive possession, being so long, it would not be

practicable in such a case to lead the evidence of persons who would be in a

position to speak from personal knowledge as to how the adverse possession

commenced. Most of the persons who had such knowledge may be dead or

cannot be traced or are incapable of giving evidence when the matter comes up

for trial. In such a situation it would be reasonable, in certain circumstances, to

draw the presumption of ouster” will have no relevance to the instant

appeal owing to the said reason.

Having reached the final part of this judgment, I shall now

proceed to consider the 2nd part, as referred to earlier in this judgment,

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

62

namely the period commencing from 1988 and ending with 1999. This

approach was adopted because the High Court of Civil Appeal, in

allowing the Defendant’s appeal, indicated its view that the

Defendant’s adverse possession had commenced from the point of

transfer of title of lots D3 and E to Dinapala de Silva in 1988, and the

Defendant was in adverse possession for an uninterrupted period of ten

years therefrom, and thus satisfying the requirement of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

In the impugned judgments, the appellate Court had concluded

“… that the Defendant had possessed the land in dispute from the year 1954

and had specifically commenced prescription at least against Dinapala de Silva

in the year 1988, who is a complete outsider, when the Defendant’s sister

transferred her right to Dinapala de Silva”. As already noted, this finding is

common to both judgments pronounced by the High Court of Civil

Appeal. The challenge mounted by the Plaintiff on the validity of the of

the judgements of the High Court of Civil Appeal was based on the

proposition that the Defendant had no contrary to the said finding,

there was no evidence of uninterrupted period of adverse possession

for ten years. Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff therefore submitted that

even if the Defendant had commenced adverse possession from the

year 1988, the year in which Juliet Perera had transferred her title over

lots D3 and E in favour of Dinapala de Silva, and continued with such

possession from that particular point onwards, clearly he had

continuous period of ten years up to the time of eviction of the Plaintiff

in 1999, by execution of writ in Case No. 1343/RE.

Before I consider the said contention of the learned Counsel for

the Plaintiff, it is relevant to consider the process of reasoning on which

the High Court of Civil Appeal had arrived at the said conclusion.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

63

It is indicative from the judgments of the appellate Court that it

had reached the said conclusion on the basis that the Defendant “…had

specifically commenced prescription at least against Dinapala de Silva in the

year 1988 who is a complete outsider, …”. The wording of the appellate

Court is clear to the extent that it had indirectly accepted the period of

adverse possession of the Defendant that claimed to have begun in 1954

and continued until 1988, does not qualify to be considered as a period

during which the Defendant had held the property adverse to the rights

of his sister. Thus, it appears, that the contention advanced by the

learned Counsel for the Plaintiff before the High Court of Civil Appeal

as well as to this Court that the Defendant had only permissive

possession of the disputed parcels of land apparently had an impact on

the process of reasoning adopted by the High Court of Civil Appeal.

With that observation, this Court must then examine the

remaining part of his contention; whether the Defendant had failed to

establish that he had possessed lots D3 and E adverse to the interests of

the Plaintiff and her predecessors in title for an uninterrupted period of

ten years as the appellate Court had allowed the two appeals only on

that basis.

In this context, it is relevant to note here that I have already

concluded that the contention of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff

that the nature of the Defendant’s possession of lots D3 and E from 1954

to 1988, clearly bears the characteristics of a permissive possession. In

the circumstances, it must then be added that, in the absence of an overt

act by the Defendant during this period, which would have given Juliet

Perera notice that the permissive possession of her brother over the said

two lots had turned adverse to her rights, there was no adverse

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

64

possession established by the former, as required by section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance during the said period of 1954 to 1988.

However, as correctly observed by the appellate Court, that

situation ought to have changed when Juliet Perera made a transfer of

her title over lots D3 and E to Dinapala de Silva on 18.01.1988. Dinapala de

Silva, being a total stranger to the said family arrangement, is not

entitled to rely on the continuation of the said permissive possession,

where the Defendant was permitted to possess lots D1, D3 and E for

and on behalf of his sisters, which had reached its terminal point with

the said transfer of title. Whether Dinapala de Silva and others who had

title to lots D3 and E, have possessed same ut dominus since 1988 and

whether it was the Defendant who had possessed these lots adverse to

the rights of the new owners from the point of acquisition of its title by

them in 1988 until they were evicted upon execution of decree in 1999

are questions that should be answered in consideration of the available

evidence.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff, during his submissions before

this Court, had pointed out certain items of evidence as instances that

demonstrably indicate that the adverse possession of lots D3 and E, as

claimed by the Defendant, had no uninterrupted period of ten years

against the Plaintiff and her immediate predecessor in title, in order to

qualify him to acquire title under section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Having pointed out such instances from the evidence,

learned Counsel then relied on a quotation from the text of a book titled

Law of Adverse Possession by M. Krishnasami (13th Ed) where it states

(at p.191) that “Possession, which can ripen into title, must be continued

without any entry or action by the legal owner of the full statutory period. An

entry by the legal owner upon the land, breaks the continuity of an adverse

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

65

possession, when it is made openly with the intention of asserting his claim

thereto and is accompanied with acts upon the land, which characterises the

assertion of title of ownership”, as a statement that describes the nature of

possession, the Defendant should have established before Court.

In view of the said contention advanced by the Plaintiff before

this Court, namely, that her immediate predecessor in title, Gamini

Ponweera, had entered into possession of lots D1, D3 and E, during the

period 1994 to 1999, when the action against Simion Perera was pending

before the District Court, it is observed that the High Court of Civil

Appeal had in fact considered the question whether the requirement of

uninterrupted period of ten years was satisfied by the Defendant. In

rejecting the said contention of the Plaintiff, the appellate Court was of

the view that, if the inquiry into applications under section 328 of the

Civil Procedure Code were proceeded with, the Defendant could have

easily established his possession against Gamini Ponweera. The appellate

Court also noted that the Defendant had successfully resisted all

attempts to oust him from the land during this period and hence is

entitled to the prescriptive title. Therefore, the appellate Court arrived

at a conclusion that the Defendant had proved his adverse possession

against the Plaintiff at least from the year 1988 for an uninterrupted

period of ten years.

Thus, it appears the appellate Court did consider the fact that

Gamini Ponweera, upon his eviction from lot D1 on 14.06.1999, had filed

an application under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Consequently, the Appellate Court also had accepted that Gamini

Ponweera was in possession of the disputed land, from 1994, until his

eviction in 1999. But unfortunately, the Court had disregarded that fact

altogether from its consideration and rejected the contention of the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

66

Plaintiff on the premise that there was no interruption of possession of

the Defendant, because, it was of the view that had the inquiry under

section 328 proceeded, the Defendant could have easily established his

adverse possession against Gamini Ponweera.

The contention advanced before this Court by the Plaintiff is line

with the case she had presented before the trial Courts seeking its

determination. The Plaintiff had raised several issues on this aspect on

the Defendant’s claim of prescription. In case No. 6906/L, issue Nos. 3b

and 3c have dealt with the possession of the plaintiff and Gamini

Ponweera, whereas in case No. 6901/L, issue Nos. 2, 4 and 5 too were

raised over same. The Defendant too, on his part had raised two issues

each in both trials, on the nature of possession as referred to above in

this judgment. The District Court as well as Additional District Court

had answered these issues in favour of the Plaintiff. The District Court

had answered the Defendant’s two issues on possession as “not

proved” while the Additional District Court only answered the issues

suggested by the Plaintiff in her favour.

Thus, in view of the Plaintiff’s contention on the validity of the

appellate Court’s conclusion on the question of possession, which is

contrary to the findings of the trial Courts on that aspect, it is necessary

that this Court considers the evidence upon which such a conclusion

was reached by the appellate Court, in adopting a contrary view to the

one adopted by the trial Courts. Having perused the available evidence

on this point, it is my view that the said affirmative conclusion reached

by the High Court of Civil Appeal on the question whether the

Defendant had established that he had adverse possession since 1988

over lots D3 and E, is clearly against the weight of the evidence that had

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

67

been presented before the trial Courts. I have reached that conclusion

upon the reasons that are set out below.

When the High Court of Civil Appeal held with the Defendant’s

claim that he had acquired prescriptive title after 1988 to lots D3 and E,

it is obvious that the required ten-year period of uninterrupted adverse

possession should be found within the said period of 1988 to 1999, the

year in which the Plaintiff was evicted by an order of Court. It is

already noted that the Defendant was engaged in a process of litigation

with his tenant Simion Perera, which commenced in the year 1985 and

continued until the former was finally placed in possession of lots D1,

D3 and E by an order of Court in June 1999, after this Court rejected the

leave to appeal application filed by the latter. During this period, the

title to lots D1, D3 and E had changed hands several times. Then, with

the execution of writ, the Defendant was placed in possession of the

three lots, along with his own lot D2, by an order of Court. Thereby the

applicable period is reduced to a period of eleven years, between 1988

and 1999.

The first outsider to hold title to lots D3 and E from the Perera

family is Dinapala de Silva. He acquired title to these two lots in 1988

from Juliet Perera and after his death, the heirs have got together and

transferred that title back to Juliet Perera in 1993. During this five-year

period, there is absolutely no evidence available before the trial Court

as to the nature of possession, the said Dinapala de Silva may have had

over the disputed parcels of land. The Defendant could therefore claim

without any challenge to the contrary that he had exclusive adverse

possession over the said parcels of land during this five-year period. In

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

68

the year 1994, Juliet Perera again transferred her rights over lots D1, D3

and E to Gamini Ponweera from whom the present Plaintiff had acquired

tittle to the two lots. But there is only six-year time gap between 1988

and 1994 (ignoring the short duration when its title was held by Juliet

Perera) and even if the Defendant had possessed the two lots adverse to

the rights of Dinalapa de Silva during that time (through his tenant, who

was placed back in possession of the entire land by Court on

01.04.1991), that period itself, being of a mere six-year duration, does

not satisfy the requirement of ten years of uninterrupted adverse

possession.

Thereafter, Gamini Ponweera had acquired title to lots D1, D3 and

E from Juliet Perera on 10.04.1994, who then transferred title of lots D3

and E to the Plaintiff on 10.03.1996. The fiscal, having executed the writ

of possession on 14.06.1999, quieted the Defendant in possession of lots

D3 and E (owned by the Plaintiff) and lot D1 (owned by Gamini

Ponweera). The Plaintiff as well as Gamini Ponweera have thereupon

moved Court under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code, against the

said eviction. The Defendant, on the day of the inquiry of the

application by Gamini Ponweera, had conceded to the latter’s possessory

rights over lot D1. The application of the Plaintiff was however

dismissed by Court on the day of the inquiry, upon her failure to

diligently pursue the said application.

The Plaintiff did not call any of her predecessors in title as

witnesses. Her husband, who gave evidence on her behalf, had no

direct knowledge of the events that had taken place prior to 1996, the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

69

year she had acquired title to lots D3 and E. It could well be that, in

order to compensate for that deficiency in their evidence, the Plaintiff

did tender a certified copy of the application by Gamini Ponweera before

the trial Courts (P7). In that application Gamini Ponweera asserts that he

had rented out lot D1 to one Sunanda Perera, who operated a service

station with his employees, whilst occupying the building standing on

lot D1, until his eviction by Court and alleged that the Defendant had

obtained the said writ of execution by suppression of relevant facts. The

fiscal report (V3a) confirms this assertion of Gamini Ponweera, as it

indicates that when the Court officer had arrived at the property in

order to execute the writ, he noted that there was a service station

housed in a building with asbestos roofing. There were several

workmen employed by one Sunanada Perera, who was in occupation of

that building, and presented himself as the owner of that service

station.

This clearly shows that contrary to the finding of the High Court

of Civil Appeal, in fact there was clear evidence before trial Courts that

Gamini Ponweera had total control over lot D1 and possession ut dominus

over same. The Defendant, until Gamini Ponweera moved Court under

section 328, had consistently maintained that he exclusively possessed

lots D1, D3 and E, along with his own lot D2, adverse to the interests of

its true owners. When that application was taken up for inquiry, the

Defendant had entered into a settlement with Gamini Ponweera by

conceding to the position that the latter is entitled to be quieted into

possession of lot D1 from the date of inquiry i.e. 24.05.2000 (P8) after

renouncing his alleged prescriptive title over it.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

70

The High Court of Civil Appeal had considered this item of

evidence that had been presented in the form of a copy of proceedings

under section 328 before the District Court, but in the process had failed

to consider this important aspect of an item of evidence it revealed. That

aspect of the evidence is in relation to the qualification on which the

Defendant had insisted to be clarified, before he enters any settlement

with Gamini Ponweera. The proceedings before trial Court revealed that

the Defendant, having first satisfied himself that there was no

“encroachment” by Gamini Ponweera into lot D2 by the latter’s act of

erection of a parapet wall on the common boundary between lots D1

and D2, had thereafter only proceeded with the said settlement in

favour of Gamini Ponweera, ending the inquiry into the application

under section 328.

The learned District Judge, in rejecting the Defendant’s assertion

that he conceded to Gamini Ponweera’s rights only because of his close

family ties, justifiably questions the acceptability of the said claim by

posing the question of, if indeed that was the case, why did the

Defendant have to wait from 1999 to concede the rights of his “family

member”, until that member files an application under section 328 and

proceeded with its inquiry after his eviction insisted on by the former?

But the High Court of Civil Appeal had rejected the Plaintiff’s

contention on this aspect, solely on a mere hypothetical premise, i.e., if

the inquiry was preceded with, the Defendant could have “easily

established” his claim of prescription. However, the High Court of Civil

Appeal did not offer any reasoning as to why it opted to differ with the

point raised by the trial judge, by raising that question or the evidence

upon which the Court had arrived at that conclusion.

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

The Defendant, in his evidence, did not clarify as to the time

period in which this parapet wall was constructed. But he made no

mention either to that construction or to the construction of a house

with asbestos roofing on lot D1 by Gamini Ponweera. But he had

accepted that it was Gamini Ponweera, who constructed the parapet wall,

at the time of the said settlement. This construction was obviously

undertaken by Gamini Ponweera after he had acquired title to lot D1

along with D3 and E, in 1994 and before the said settlement was entered

in the year 2000. The very acts of constructing a house with asbestos

roofing and erecting a parapet wall separating lot D1 from lot D2,

within the confines of the larger land claimed by the Defendant,

without any resistance or objection from him is a clear indication that

Gamini Ponweera had possessed at least lot D1 ut dominus since

acquiring its paper title, despite the claim of exclusive possession by the

Defendant during the said four-year period adverse to rights of the

actual owner.

During the period 1994 to 1996, lots D3 and E were owned by

Gamini Ponweera along with lot D1. What must be noted here is Gamini

Ponweera had erected this parapet wall, when he had title to all three

lots, and therefore the interruption to the Defendant’s possession is

applicable to lots D3 and E as well. The Defendant nonetheless asserts

that he possessed lots D1, D3 and E adverse to the rights of its true

owners. It is evident that Gamini Ponweera had possessed lot D1 from

1994 as his own property and continued in that state until he was

evicted by an order of Court in 1999. During this five-year period, the

evidence clearly points to the fact that the Defendant never had any

possession over lot D1, until he was placed possession of same in 1999

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

72

by Court. The series of acts attributed to Gamini Ponweera, namely,

construction of a parapet wall, construction of a house, renting same

out to a third party until his eviction in 1999 and regaining all his rights

over lot D1 in 2000, all points to a justifiable finding of fact that Gamini

Ponweera had possessed lot D1 ut dominus.

Similarly, the Plaintiff obtained title to lot D3 and E from Gamini

Ponweera on 10.03.1996 and instituted the instant actions on 10.07.2007,

seeking declaration of title in respect of each of the two lots D3 and E

and eviction of the Defendant therefrom. It is clear that during the

period of two years from 1994 to 1996, it was Gamini Ponweera who had

the possession of lots D3 and E along with lot D1. The time period of

eight years from 1988 to 1996, even if the Defendant had adverse

possession over lots D3 and E during this time, he is not entitled to a

decree in his favour as the required ten-year period of such possession

was not satisfied.

Similarly, if there is evidence that the Plaintiff too had come into

possession of lots D3 and E, after her acquisition of title to same at any

point of time before 1999, thereby interrupting the completion of a

continuous period of ten years reckoned from 1988, then too the

Defendant is not entitled to a decree under section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. In the circumstances, the question whether there was such

evidence placed before the trial Courts must be considered by this

Court.

The Plaintiff had placed oral and documentary evidence before

trial Courts, which indicated what they did with the land after

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

73

acquiring paper title to same in 1996 from Gamini Ponweera. It is correct

that only the Plaintiff’s husband gave evidence on her behalf in both

trials. However, the said witness, in addition to his oral evidence, in

which he described the nature of possession that the Plaintiff has had

over lots D3 and E since becoming its owner, also tendered several

documents as evidence, in support of his wife’s possession. The

assertions made by the witness for the Plaintiff relates to incidents that

he himself did witness by participation and thus are termed as direct

evidence on those events. As correctly noted by the High Court of Civil

Appeal, the witness for the Plaintiff only spoken of the events that had

taken place since her acquisition of paper title to lots D3 and E in 1996.

Witness Charles Amarasekara, being the husband of the Plaintiff

and whilst giving evidence on her behalf, had stated that during the

week which followed the execution of the transfer deed in favour of his

wife in 1996, they had entered into possession of the land. Having

cleared same of vegetation they had demolished a derelict building

standing on it along with an overhead tank. They also demolished a

part of the boundary wall and taken steps to install a gate in order to

gain access to lots D3 and E from the public road. During his evidence

Amarasekara had also tendered a copy of the application made to the

District Court in case No. 1343/RE under section 328, subsequent to her

eviction by the fiscal marked as P7.

The High Court of Civil Appeal rejected the Plaintiff’s claim on

the footing that these were the actions taken by her to establish

possession only after acquisition of paper title and the witness called by

her is unable to give evidence with regard to the nature of possession of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

74

the land before she made the said purchase and did not call any

predecessor in title to challenge the Defendant’s claim of adverse

possession. This is an erroneous conclusion since the Plaintiff had in

fact placed evidence before the trial Courts in the form of documentary

evidence, as to the nature of possession her predecessor in title had over

the two lots, when she tendered Gamini Ponweera’s application under

section 328 (P7), along with her own application (P6). The judgments of

the appellate Court did not indicate whether it had considered the

contents of these two items of documentary evidence or not. The

appellate Court also failed to indicate its own determination on the

learned District Judge’s finding that the Defendant had no

uninterrupted possession for a period of ten years over lots D3 and E.

In her application under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code,

the Plaintiff had averred that upon acquisition of title to lots D3 and E,

she had obtained an assessment number and paid assessment rates to

the local authority. This application, although indicating the intention

on the part of the Plaintiff to possess the land to which she had acquired

title ut dominus, does not qualify to be taken as an instance of an

interruption to the Defendant’s possession over lots D3 and E.

However, the acts of demolition of a derelict building and the

demolition of a part of the parapet wall in order to put up a gate as

claimed by the Plaintiff, in itself would qualify to be taken as instances

of asserting her rights over the land and thereby at least interrupting

the Defendant’s possession. The Defendant had cross-examined the

witness at length over this issue and suggested there were no buildings

standing on the land at that point of time.

The fiscal report (V5) indicates that the Court officer had

observed an overhead tank on that land in 1991. Except for this he had

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

75

not noticed any other buildings standing on that land. But the overhead

tank was distinctly mentioned in the said report. This was before even

the Plaintiff had acquired her title to the land. The witness for the

Plaintiff may have exaggerated as to the demolition activity carried out

on the land, but the claim that he did demolish the masonry structure of

an overhead tank is supported by other independent evidence, namely

the fiscal report. The Defendant too, in the case No. 6901/L, admits that

the Plaintiff had demolished a building standing on that land. But,

despite these acts of interference with his claim of adverse possession,

the Defendant did nothing to prevent the Plaintiff from possessing the

land or dealing with it the way she pleased. The Defendant at the very

least did not register even a nominal verbal protest for her actions on

the land. Until he had raised the plea of prescription through his

answer to the instant actions instituted by the Plaintiff, she had no

occasion or reason even to suspect that the Defendant had commenced

adverse possession against her rights.

The claim of demolition by the Plaintiff is a probable one as her

building plan for the lots D3 and E was approved by the local authority

on 22.08.1997 (after a period of seventeen months since she acquired

title) and justifies an inference that she wanted the land to be cleared

fully to facilitate the proposed construction of a dwelling house.

Importantly, the demolition of a part of the parapet wall that had been

put up by Barlin Perera and installation of a gate by the Plaintiff to lots

D3 and E, was objected to by the Defendant, as indicative by letter V6.

The purpose of this demolition and installation of a gate was to have

independent access to the public road to lots D3 and E, since the only

gate that had served the entire land had been put up by the father of the

Defendant and it provided access to the public road only to lot D2 at

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

76

that point of time. Thus, the Plaintiff lost no time in installing a gate to

her property after acquiring title to same. This obvious interruption to

the Defendant’s possession was met, not by resorting to a legal remedy

on the strength of his prescriptive title, but by merely writing a letter to

the local authority requesting the authority to desist from granting

permission to the proposed construction activity of the Plaintiff. The

reply to the Defendant’s complaint by the local authority (V6) indicate

that it relates to an unauthorised construction of a parapet wall. In fact,

the Ja-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha, in response to the Defendant’s complaint

of an unauthorised construction by the Plaintiff, had directed him twice

indicating its position that, unless he obtains a Court order within 14

days, the authority would proceed to approve her building plan.

Despite these clear directions, the Defendant opted not to seek any legal

remedy against the activities of the Plaintiff over the land and to assert

his alleged prescriptive title over the lot D3 and E.

The Plaintiff’s husband who participated in the inquiry held by

the local authority into the Defendant’s petition objecting to granting

approval to their building plan, said in evidence that Defendant’s basis

of objection was based only on the fact that there was ongoing litigation

with Simion Perera. The Defendant himself admitted in evidence that

during the inquiry before the local authority, the officials have advised

the Plaintiff’s husband not to proceed with the purchase because of the

said pending litigation. He also admitted before the trial Courts that

witness for the Plaintiff Amarasekara had demolished a part of the

existing boundary wall and made constructions on lots D3 and E.

What is important to note here is that the Defendant did not

claim any prescriptive title to the said property to the Plaintiff even at

that point of time. Certainly, this was yet another opportunity for the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

77

Defendant to expressly claim of his acquisition of title to lots D3 and E

on the basis of being in possession for a long period of time and to put

the Plaintiff on notice of his rights and to resist her possession. But he

had apparently kept that claim of prescription as a secret and divulged

it only when the Plaintiff sought to evict him by filing the instant

actions.

These several instances of activity to which the witness to the

Plaintiff had referred to in his evidence are clearly supported by

contents of the documentary evidence that had contemporaneously

been made and existed even before the instant litigations are instituted.

Some of these items of documentary evidence were tendered to Court

by the Defendant himself. If the Defendant’s adverse possession of lots

D1, D3 and E was interrupted during the period commencing from 1988

and 1999, and thereby denying him of fulfilling the requirement of

having adverse possession for an uninterrupted period of ten years

within that 11-year period, then he is not entitled for a decree in his

favour under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Thus, as indicated earlier on, I am of the view that when the High

Court of Civil Appeal rejected the Plaintiff’s claim of being in

possession of lots D3 and E on the footing that these instances refers

only to actions taken by her after acquisition of paper title and therefore

her failure to call any of her predecessors in title to rebut the

Defendant’s claim of adverse possession by leading evidence as to the

nature of possession they had over lots D3 and E, the appellate Court

had clearly fallen into error in its failure to consider the evidence that

had been referred to in the preceding paragraphs. In arriving at the said

erroneous conclusion, the High Court of Civil Appeal also failed to

consider whether these several acts of the Plaintiff did interrupt the

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

78

continuity of the alleged adverse possession relied on by the Defendant.

There is a definite finding of fact by the District Court that the adverse

possession of the Defendant was interrupted during the period 1988 to

2007, which in turn based on the Defendant’s own admission, upon

being suggested so by the Plaintiff. The appellate Court had

unfortunately ignored all these important items of evidence, that had

been presented by the Plaintiff in both oral and documentary forms, in

relation to the underlying issue, whether the Defendant had

uninterrupted possession of ten years since 1988. The appellate Court

offered no reason to justify why it opted to hold contrary to the finding

of these relevant facts in issue by the trial Court.

The fact that the Defendant, despite his claim of having been in

possession of the same for over four decades, did not resort to legal

remedies to prevent the Plaintiff from continuing in her activities over

lots D3 and E, on the basis that she has paper title to the property and

thereby disturbing his rights acquired by adverse possession over same,

justifies drawing an inference that he did not do so because he had

acknowledged a right existing in the Plaintiff for her to engage in such

activity over the said two lots. The Defendant had full knowledge of the

activities of the Plaintiff over the two lots. If that in fact the case is, then

the Defendant is clearly disqualified to a decree in his favour, under

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Considering the available

evidence, it is clear that the possession of the Defendant was repeatedly

interrupted by the activities of the Plaintiff and thereby denied the

former of an uninterrupted period of ten years of adverse possession.

Therefore, the answer of the District Court to the issue No. 11 of

the Defendant, whether the Plaintiff had no possession in whatever

form to the lands described the 3rd, 4th and 5th schedules to the plaint

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

79

(lots D2. D3 and E respectively) in case No. 6906/L, as “not proved”, is

a conclusion well supported by the body of evidence presented before

it. Thus, the conclusions reached by the High Court of Civil Appeal

that “it is clear that the Defendant had always successfully resisted all

attempts to oust him” and the “Defendant had been able to establish that he

had continued possession of the land until this action was filed by the

Plaintiff”, are clearly contrary to the weight of available evidence and,

for that reason, are considered as erroneous.

Thus, in conclusion, I am of the view that during the period 1969

to 1988 the Defendant only had permissive possession of Juliet Perera

and, in the absence of any overt act by which the permissive character

of his possession turned into an undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession by which a denial of a right existing in the latter could be

fairly and reasonably inferred during this period, he is not entitled to a

decree under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. During the period

1988 to 1999, also he had failed to establish uninterrupted adverse

possession of lots D3 and E, for a period of ten years.

Therefore, the question of law on which leave was granted in

both the instant appeals, namely, whether the learned Judges of the

High Court erred in law in failing to appreciate that the Defendant

failed to show an overt act or adverse possession against Plaintiff,

namely the Defendant’s sister during the period 1969 –1994, is

answered in the affirmative and in favour of the Plaintiff.

Hence, the impugned judgments of the High Court of Civil

Appeal in appeal Nos. WP/HCCA/NEG/03/2014 (F) and

WP/HCCA/NEG /39/2013(F) are hereby set aside. The judgments of

the District Court of Negombo in case No. 6906/ L and the judgment of

S.C. Appeal No. 116/2020

80

the Additional District Court of Negombo in case No. 6901/L, which

held in favour of the Plaintiff are restored back and affirmed.

The appeals of the Plaintiff, SC Appeal Nos. 116/20 and 117/20

are accordingly allowed with costs in all three Courts.
