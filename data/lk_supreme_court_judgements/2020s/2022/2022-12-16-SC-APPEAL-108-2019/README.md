Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District Court of

Gampaha seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 200,000/- with interest. The

defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the action. After trial, the

District Court entered judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha set aside the judgment of the District

Court and allowed the appeal. This appeal by the plaintiff is against the

judgment of the High Court. This Court granted leave to appeal against

the judgment of the High Court on the following two questions of law

(reproduced verbatim):

(a) Did the learned High Court judges err in failing to appreciate that the

mere fact that the two letters were obtained on the same day, does

not show that the two transactions are the same, especially when

there is overwhelming evidence to show that the jewellery was

obtained earlier by the defendant from the plaintiffs wife and the

money was obtained at a later date from the plaintiff?

(b) Did the learned High Court judge disregard and/or misunderstand

the evidence placed before court by the parties and the learned High

Court judge set aside the District Court judgment and dismissed the

Plaintiffs action?

Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was served with notice several

times, the defendant was absent and unrepresented before this Court.

The defendant is a close relation of the plaintiff and his wife. Before the

marriage, the defendant had helped the plaintiff and his wife in their

4

SC/APPEAL/108/2019

household chores for a considerable length of time. According to the

evidence of the defendant, she has studied up to the G.C.E. Ordinary Level

examination.

The case for the plaintiff is that after the defendants marriage on

06.03.2003, the defendant borrowed Rs. 200,000/- to construct a house

but that money was not returned. P1 dated 08.07.2009 written by the

defendant corroborates this. It is in her handwriting. By that letter the

defendant has agreed to repay the said money in monthly instalments of

Rs. 5,000/-. The fact that a sum of Rs. 180,000/- was withdrawn by the

plaintiff from the Bank was corroborated through the evidence of a Bank

officer although there is no evidence to say that that money was entirely

given to the defendant.

The defendants position as stated in the answer is that: the plaintiffs wife

gave her Rs. 75,000/- as a wedding gift but later wanted the money back

on the insistence of the plaintiffs son; since the defendant was not able to

pay back, the plaintiffs wife gave the defendant jewellery to pawn and pay

the son; P1 was signed as security for giving the jewellery. The defendant

gave evidence at the trial.

The plaintiff and his wife gave evidence at the trial. Their position is that

the jewellery was taken by the defendant from the plaintiffs wife to return

after the wedding and Rs. 200,000/- was taken from the plaintiff after the

wedding to construct a house. According to the plaintiff and his wife, these

are two different transactions. This evidence is acceptable.

The defendant has neither returned the money nor the jewellery; instead

the jewellery has been pawned by the defendant and the money taken has

been used by her.

Regarding the failure to return the jewellery, the wife of the plaintiff has

filed a separate action in the District Court and it has been settled, in that

5

SC/APPEAL/108/2019

the defendant has agreed to redeem the jewellery and return it to the

plaintiffs wife (the plaintiff in the other case). The instant case was

pending at the time of entering into the settlement in the other case but

this matter was not mentioned in the other case. If P1 was relevant to the

dispute on the jewellery, the parties could have informed the District Court

of the same and arrived at an overall settlement. The instant case has not

even been mentioned in the settlement in the other case.

If the plaintiff or his wife gave money to the defendant which was not

returned, it is very unlikely that the plaintiffs wife would give jewellery to

the defendant to pawn and pay the money back. There is no logic in that

argument. If the plaintiffs wife wanted to satisfy her son, she herself could

have pawned her jewellery and pretended to her son that the defendant

had paid the money. Why did the plaintiffs wife need to give the jewellery

to the defendant? What is the connection between P1 and handing over

jewellery to the defendant? There is no connection. This is the evidence of

the defendant regarding the connection between P1 and the jewellery.

There is no reason for signing P1 as security; there is no meaning to it. It

is an absolutely meaningless and false stand taken up by the defendant.

6

SC/APPEAL/108/2019

Even if this argument of the defendant is accepted, still the plaintiffs

money needs to be repaid for the reason that the money generated from

the pawned jewellery does not belong to the defendant.

V1 dated 08.07.2009 is relevant to the jewellery dispute. By V1 the

defendant has promised to redeem the jewellery before a particular date.

V1 is also in the defendants handwriting.

The brief judgment of the High Court is completely unsatisfactory. No

reasons acceptable to this Court have been given for setting aside the

judgment of the District Court. The High Court Judge says the fact that

P1 and V1 bear the same date corroborates the defendants story. (,

1 2009.07.08 1

.) But as I have already

explained, there is no correlation between P1 and V1. The High Court

Judge also says (without stating any reason) that P1 is security for

pawning the jewellery. There is no basis for this finding. (

I answer both questions of law in the affirmative and set aside the

judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment of the District Court.

The plaintiff is entitled to costs in all three Courts.
