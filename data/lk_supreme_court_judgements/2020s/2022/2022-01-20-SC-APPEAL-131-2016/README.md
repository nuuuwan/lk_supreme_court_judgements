Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the two defendants in the

District Court seeking a decree in her favour on the basis that the

defendants are holding the property in suit in trust for the

plaintiff. In the alternative, the plaintiff claimed the property on

unjust enrichment. The defendants sought dismissal of the

action. After trial, the District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs

case. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the judgment of the

District Court. This appeal is against the judgment of the High

Court.

The position taken up by the plaintiff in the plaint was that she

borrowed a sum of Rs. 25,000 from the 1st defendant and as

4

SC/APPEAL/131/2016

security for the said loan transferred the land in suit in the name

of the 1st defendant. She also stated that at the time of the

execution of the deed the 1st defendant signed another informal

agreement (which she tendered with the plaint marked P2) to say

that once the consideration stated in the deed is paid with

interest, the 1st defendant agrees to retransfer the property to the

plaintiff. According to the plaint, notwithstanding the repayment

of Rs. 25,000, the 1st defendant did not retransfer the property

but instead had transferred the property to the 2nd defendant by

deed No. 2164.

The 1st defendant in the answer stated that deed No. 4057 is an

out and out transfer of the land in consideration of the payment

by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff of a sum of Rs. 15,000 and

that it is not subject to a constructive trust. The 1st defendant

denied any informal agreement between the parties.

At the trial, the evidence of the plaintiff was unclear and

confusing. As the learned District Judge had correctly observed,

the plaintiff was inconsistent in the positions taken. Contrary to

what she stated in the plaint, her evidence at the trial was that

she never executed a deed, and deed No. 4057 is a fraudulent

deed in that her signature was obtained on some blank half sheet

papers that have later been converted to a deed of transfer. In

evidence, she neither marked deed No. 4057 nor the

contemporaneous informal agreement through which the 1st

defendant allegedly promised to retransfer the property to the

plaintiff once the money was paid with interest, even though those

documents were tendered with the plaint.

5

SC/APPEAL/131/2016

Her evidence that she was unaware of the value of the property

rendered it impossible for the District Court to grant relief even

on the alternative claim of unjust enrichment.

It is unfortunate that no proper evidence was given by the plaintiff

at the trial. Her evidence was completely unsatisfactory and

unreliable. No other witness was called by her. It is likely that

the defendants did not give evidence because the plaintiff did not

prove her case.

The District Judge who saw and heard the evidence of the plaintiff

found it difficult to accept her evidence, and rightly so. The High

Court cannot be found fault with when it decided not to interfere

with the judgment of the District Court.

This court granted leave to appeal on two questions of law. One

is whether the High Court failed to consider that deed No. 4057

is necessarily subject to an undertaking or condition of retransfer,

which in effect creating a constructive trust. This question shall

be answered in the negative. Deed No. 4057 which the plaintiff

did not produce in evidence is not a conditional transfer; it is an

outright transfer. The plaintiff never gave clear evidence on

retransfer. The informal document with the purported condition

of retransfer was never produced in evidence. On top of that, the

position taken up by her in evidence was not that deed No. 4057

is subject to the condition of retransfer but that the deed is a

forgery. In view of this finding, there is no necessity to express

my views on the latter part of the question.

The other question of law is unspecific and couched in broader

terms. It is whether the High Court failed to consider that the

District Court erred in law and fact in deciding the case. In my

6

SC/APPEAL/131/2016

view, the District Court did not err in law and fact when it decided

to dismiss the plaintiffs case on the basis that the plaintiff failed

to prove her case. As such, this question shall also be answered

in the negative.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
