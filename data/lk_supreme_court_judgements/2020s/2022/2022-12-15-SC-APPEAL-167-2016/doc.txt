A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The original Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted this action against the original 10th Defendant-Appellant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 10th Defendant) in the District Court of Elpitiya to

partition a land called ‘Iddagoda Owita’ in extent 5 acres, morefully described in the

schedule to the amended Plaint dated 18/05/1994. In the pleadings, the Plaintiff

specifically denied that the 10th Defendant had any rights over the corpus to be

partitioned.

In the answer dated 25/07/1990, the 10th Defendant disclosed several parties seeking to

intervene, purportedly claiming long possession of the land and also stated that Lot 3

shown as a roadway in Plan No. 2808 does not form part of the corpus.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge by Judgment dated 29/11/2004,

inter alia, identified the land depicted in Lot 1, 2 and 3 in Plan No. 2808 as the corpus

to be partitioned.

Aggrieved by the said Judgment, the 10th Defendant preferred an appeal to the Civil

Appellate High Court of Galle. The Appellate Court by its Judgment dated 12/03/2014,

set aside the Judgment of the District Court and held that the learned District Judge has

failed to identify the corpus and therefore, the Plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment in

terms of the Partition Act.

The Plaintiff is before this Court to set aside the said Judgement dated 12/03/2014.

This Court by Order dated 21/09/2016, granted Leave to Appeal in terms of paragraph

15(a) of Petition of Appeal dated 08/04/2014, which states as follows;

P a g e 5 | 8

“once the parties admit the corpus sought to be partitioned, at the commencement, are

the parties required to adduce evidence to identify the corpus, notwithstanding the

admission.”

The Plaintiff’s position is that at the commencement of the trial all parties including the

10th Defendant admitted that Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the Preliminary Plan No. 2808 dated

29/10/1989, made by licenced surveyor D.G. Mendis marked ‘X’, form the corpus of

the land sought to be partitioned. It was contended that when the corpus to be partitioned

is identified and admitted by the parties, then the Court should act upon the said

Preliminary Plan and thereafter no onus is cast upon the parties to adduce further

evidence to establish that the said plan relates to the corpus sought to be partitioned.

The 10th Defendant’s appeal against the Judgment of the District Court was on the basis

that the admission of the Preliminary Plan No. 2808, dated 29/10/1989, marked ‘X’

made by licenced surveyor D. G. Mendis was misinterpreted by the District Court. The

10th Respondent claims title to a land called “Iddagoda Owita Pahala Kaballa”. In

paragraph 2 of the answer of the 10th Defendant, the boundaries of the said land are

described as “Iddagoda Owita Pahala Kaballa”. In the same paragraph, it is admitted

that the said land is morefully depicted as Lot 1, 2 and 3 of the said Preliminary

Surveyor Plan No. 2808. The pleaded case of the 10th Defendant was that the land

described as “Iddagoda Owita Pahala Kaballa” was within the land described in the

Preliminary Plan.

On 23/02/1999, when the admissions were recorded, all parties including the 10th

Defendant explicitly admitted that Lot 1, 2 and 3 in Plan No. 2808 forms the corpus of

the land sought to be partitioned.

The admissions recorded on the said date reads as follows;

ms,s.kS'

The 10th Defendant’s claim on the land to be partitioned is grounded on Deed No. 9877

dated 04/01/1927. In cross examination, answering a preliminary question of fact, the

10th Defendant admitted that the property called “Iddagoda Owita comprise of

“Iddagoda Owita Pahala Kaballa”, “Iddagoda Owita Ihala Kaballa” and the centre road

which forms the corpus to be partitioned. Thereafter, on several occasions during cross

examination the 10th Defendant admitted that the land surveyed was the correct land

and it consists of extent 5 acres 8 perches. The 10th Respondent also admitted the

defined boundary of Lot 3 in Plan ‘X’ which divides Lot 1 and 2 as a roadway.

The boundaries of the corpus sought to be partitioned in Plan ‘X’ and the boundaries of

the land described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint are identical. As noted above,

the 10th Defendant in his answer admitted that the corpus to be partitioned is depicted

in Plan No. 2808, marked ‘X’. At no point had the parties including the 10th Defendant

were at variance regarding the identity of the corpus and there is no evidence led that

the land claimed by the 10th Defendant is a specific portion of a larger land. The 10th

Defendant failed to adduce any evidence to prove that the land described as “Iddagoda

Owita Pahala Kaballa” was a different land from that what was sought to be partitioned.

The 10th Defendant’s said admission of the corpus to be partitioned is a fact admitted

at the hearing which needs no further proof in terms of Section 58 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

P a g e 7 | 8

In similar circumstances, on the question of permissibility to withdraw an admission,

Fernando J. in Uvais vs. Punyawathie, (1993) 2 SLR 46, declared that “It is sometimes

permissible to withdraw admissions on questions of law but admissions on questions of

fact cannot be withdrawn”. Permitting withdrawal of admissions was observed to

subvert some of the most fundamental principles of the Civil Procedure Code in regard

to pleadings and issues.

In Mariammai vs. Pethrupillai 21 NLR 200, it was held that;

“if a party in a case makes an admission for whatever reason, he must stand by it; it is

impossible for him to argue a point on appeal which he formally gave up in the court

below”.

Similarly, in Jayalath vs. Karunathilake (2013) 1 SLR 337, the Court held that;

“if the subject matter is admitted no further proof of the identity of the corpus is

required; for no party is burdened with adducing further proof of an admitted fact”.

The 10th Defendant’s express and unambiguous admission is that Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the

Preliminary Plan No. 2808, dated 29/10/1989, marked ‘X’ made by licenced surveyor

D.G. Mendis forms the corpus sought to be partitioned. The 10th Defendant is bound by

the said admission and cannot be permitted to digress from the said assertion.

Therefore, we find that the learned District Judge did not err in relying on the said

admission made at the commencement of the hearing to satisfy himself of the identity

of the land sought to be partitioned.

Accordingly, the question posed by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant is answered in

the negative.

The Judgement of the Civil Appeal High Court dated 12/03/2014 is set aside and the

appeal is allowed.

Appeal allowed. No costs ordered.
