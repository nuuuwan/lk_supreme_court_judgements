preferring Appeal against order by the High Court of Kandy dated the 13th October

2016.

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 17

This Application precedes from a Plaint filed by the Complainant-Respondent-

Respondent, the Officer in Charge of the Wattegama Police Station, (hereinafter

referred to as the “Complainant” at the Magistrate Court of Theldeniya which

contained the following 3 charges against the Accused:

a) A charge under Section 177 of the Penal Code, that the Petitioner being a

person who was legally bound to state the truth on any subject to a public

servant, namely SI./ Upali Chandrasiri of the Wattegama Police, refused to

answer the questions demanded of him.

b) A charge under Section 344 of the Penal Code, that the Petitioner obstructed a

public servant, namely, the said SI./ Upali Chandrasiri from performing duties,

and

c) A charge under Section 186 of the Penal Code, that the Petitioner threatened a

public servant, namely the said SI./ Upali Chandrasiri, of injury

At the conclusion of the trial, judgment had been delivered on 24th July 2015 finding

the accused guilty of the first and second count and acquitting him on the third count.

The Accused was sentenced on 07th August 2015 imposing fines of LKR 100 on the first

count, and LKR 1500 on the second count.

Being aggrieved by the same, the Accused had preferred appeal to the High

Court of Kandy to have the judgment of the Magistrate set aside. After hearing

submissions of both parties, the Learned High Court Judge delivered order on 13th

October 2016 dismissing the appeal and affirming the Judgment of the Magistrate.

The Accused appears before this Court seeking both above judgments to be set

aside on the grounds set out in the Petition dated 23rd November 2016. On 02nd June

2017, Court was inclined to grant Leave to Appeal on the following question of law

upon hearing both counsel in support of their respective cases;

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 17

“Has the prosecution complied with the provisions contained in Section

135(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code in obtaining the sanction of the

Hon. Attorney General before filing plaint under Section 177 of the Penal

Code”

In ascertaining the same, the facts and circumstances of this application are as

enumerated below.

The Facts

The facts of the case as per the evidence led by the prosecution are such that a

complaint had been made on 7th January 2001 by the virtual complainant Chandani

Wijayanthimala Ekanayake against the Accused that the Accused had failed to return

some jewellery which he had taken from her and that the Accused was then required

to attend an inquiry into such complaint on 15th January 2007.

As such the evidence of the six witnesses was called by the prosecution, namely

two police officers; SI./ U.G.R. Mudiyanselage Upali Chandrasiri and PS/5942 T.

Mudiyanselage Thilakaratne Bana, the complainant; Chandani Wijayanthimala

Ekanayake, the complainant’s sister; Roshini Ekanayake and two persons who

witnessed the encounter, namely Herath Pahala Gedara Abeyratne and P.G. Yasarathne

Banda.

As per the narration of facts by SI Upali Chandrasiri, as supported by the

statements of PS Thilakaratne Banda, SI Upali Chandrasiri had commenced inquiring

into the said complaint against the Accused relating to the misappropriation of some

jewellery and cash belonging to the complainant. He states that at the time the

appellant used offensive language on him, obstructed the performance of his duties

and the Accused attempted to squeeze his own neck.

H.P Abeyratne and P. Yasarathne Banda had been present at the Wattegama

Police on the relevant day for matters unrelated to the present application. The former

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 17

states that at the time, 30 to 40 persons were present at the police station and that

when the relevant inquiry relating to the Accused was taken up, the Accused used

offensive language and attempted to squeeze his own neck, upon which he had been

taken inside the police station. The evidence of the latter corresponds with the same

narration of facts and he identified the Accused as the person who behaved in such a

manner.

The narration of facts as per the Accused is such that he had attended the

inquiry on 15th January 2007 with his Attorneys at Law, who had left the police station

subsequent to making representations to SI Upali Chandrasiri and being given the

indication that he needed to record a statement from the Accused. The Accused states

that when he attempted to sit on a chair nearby for the purpose of making said

statement, SI Upali Chandrasiri and PS Tillakaratne had inquired from him as to who

asked the Accused to sit and had severely assaulted him, notwithstanding the accused

having indicated to the police that he was being treated for a heart condition at the

time. He further states that he was thereafter locked up and was later produced the

Teldeniya Magistrate on a B Report.

The Accused took up the position that at the time the Accused was asked to

attend the said inquiry on 15th January 2007, there had been no complaint recorded

against him. On behalf of the Accused, evidence was led to the effect of corroborating

this stance by one M.G. Jayawardena, one Kumari Abeyratne who was the translator of

the MC Panwila and Chief Inspector Samarakoon Mudiyanselage Jayantha in that the

Complaint had been made against the Accused only on the date of inquiry, the 15th

January 2007, itself.

At the conclusion of the trial the Hon. Magistrate delivered judgment finding

the Accused guilty on the 1st and 2nd counts as enumerated above and acquitted him

on the 3rd count. Upon appeal to the High Court of Kandy (Central Province) being set

aside, this Court granted Leave on the following singular question of law, which I will

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 17

reiterate and endeavour to address without disturbing the findings of the lower courts

in terms of the substantive matters beyond the following particular question of law:

“Has the prosecution complied with the provisions contained in Section

135(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code in obtaining the sanction of the

Hon. Attorney General before filing plaint under Section 177 of the Penal

Code”

Compliance with the Sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

The ground of appeal stems from the first charge against the Accused being

under Section 177 of the Penal Code. Section 177 of the Penal Code pertains to the

refusal of any person legally bound to state the truth on any subject to any authorised

public servant refusing to answer such questions demanded of him. The maximum

sentence as under the same provision is of simple imprisonment for a maximum term

of six months, or with a maximum fine of Hundred Rupees or with both. While the

contents of this provision are of little concern to the question of law at hand, it

becomes pertinent as under Section 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979 as amended, which states as follows:

“(1) Any court shall not take cognizance of -

(a) any offence punishable under sections 170 to 185 (both inclusive)

of the Penal Code except with the previous sanction of the Attorney-

General or on the complaint of the public servant concerned or of

some public servant to whom he is subordinate;”

As such, in order for any complaint under Section 177 of the Penal Code to be made,

the previous sanction of the Attorney General or the Complaint of a public servant or

the complaint of some public servant who is his superior is required. As such, it is clear

that any one of such; the sanction or either complaints, would suffice to fulfil this

requirement.

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 17

The Accused argues that the above provision has not been complied with,

leading to a patent lack of jurisdiction in the instant case. The Accused enumerates

that there is no sanction of the Attorney-General, which is a fact that is not contested

by the Respondents. As such, the Accused interprets the term “complaint”, which is a

prerequisite as per the above provision in the absence of such sanction, to exclude the

procedure followed by the Respondents.

The Accused examines the first and second subsections of Section 136 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act to afford an interpretation to the term “complaint”.

The relevant portion of Section 136 have been reproduced below for ease of reference:

“(1) Proceedings in a Magistrate's Court shall be instituted in one of the

following ways: -

(a) on a complaint being made orally or in writing to a Magistrate of

such court that an offence has been committed which such court has

jurisdiction either to inquire into or try:

Provided that such a complaint if in writing shall be drawn and

countersigned by a pleader and signed by the complainant; or

(b) on a written report to the like effect being made to a Magistrate of

such court by an inquirer appointed under Chapter XI or by a peace

officer or a public servant or a servant of a Municipal Council or of an

Urban Council or of a Town Council; or …..”

Accordingly, the Code of Criminal Procedure identifies complaints made orally or in

writing separately from written reports to the Magistrate of such court by a public

servant. It is the Accused’s position that owing to the same, the mere filing of a B report

by the Respondent is insufficient to fulfil the requirements as a report can be

distinguished from a complaint, and the B report squarely falls within the definition of

a ”report” as opposed to a “complaint” as is required under Section 135. On this

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 17

interpretation, the Respondent disagrees in that the B report indeed amounts to a

complaint as is required under the aforementioned provisions.

To substantiate the same, the Accused appears to rely on the case of R.P

Wijesiri Vs. the Attorney General 1980 2 SLR 317, wherein an indictment was

presented to the High Court of Kandy under Section 480 of the Penal Code and the

preliminary objection of non-compliance with Section 135(1)(f) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure was raised. In this particular case there was no previous sanction of the

Attorney-General nor was there a complaint to the effect, as such the Preliminary

objection was upheld in that the High Court lacked competence.

However, it must be noted that the case of Wijesiri can be distinguished from

the present case as the charges levelled in the two cases are drastically different in

nature, secondly the applicable provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure in that

case was Section 135(1)(f) whereas Section 135 (1)(a) is being considered at present.

The requirements of complaint and sanction under Section 135 (1)(f) vary from that of

Section 135(1)(a) and therefore different standards and procedure are expected in

instances falling within the scope of either provision. As per Section 135(1)(f) sanction

is required “with” a complaint, whereas Section 135 (1)(a) requires the sanction of the

Attorney general or the complaint of the public servant concerned or their superior.

Despite the above, the views of Hon. Ranasinghe J in relevance to the concept

of sanction and complaint are notable in relation to the instant case. Hon. Ranasinghe

J examined the objects and reasons for the requirement of the Attorney General’s

"sanction" set out in Section 147 of the previous Code (which is the counterpart of

Section 135 of the present Code) as are set out in Dias Commentary on the Ceylon

Criminal Procedure Code at. p. 381, quoting:

"the object of such legislation is two-fold, viz (1) to prevent the process of the

Criminal Courts from being prostituted for the purpose of harassing an

enemy by way of revenge or out of spite, and (ii) to enable the authorities to

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 17

discourage false and vexatious cases, and to keep under control the number

of prosecutions by requiring some public officer or Court to examine the facts

of the case before a prosecution is sanctioned. Such legislation is a

'precautionary measure, in order to prevent frivolous or otherwise

undesirable proceedings by private persons' - R v Meera Saibo”

As quite aptly framed above, the purpose of the legislation in terms of Section

135 is to discourage malicious prosecution and to mitigate the filling of any

unnecessary cases through having a preliminary process of scrutiny by either public

officials in the specified capacity or the Attorney General prior to bringing a matter to

the attention of the relevant competent court. This acts as a measure of safeguarding

persons accused of the offences specified without the intervention of Courts.

As such, Section 135 can be distinguished from Section 136. Section 135

outlines conditions necessary for initiating proceedings in terms for the prosecution

of certain Penal Offences whereas Section 136 differs in scope as it pertains to the

method of initiation of proceedings before the Magistrate’s Court. As such, Section

136 does not refer to any specific offences, outlines a different procedure from that of

Section 135, and even forms part of a different chapter (Chapter XIV) as opposed to

Section 135 (Chapter XII), thus it exists to serve different occasions than that of Section

135.

For this reason, I find that the interpretation of complaint or report cannot be

specifically drawn from Section 136 when the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly

provides for an interpretation of this term in Section 2, which is reproduced as follows

for ease of reference:

“"complaint" means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate

with a view to his taking action under this Code that some person, whether

known or unknown, has committed an offence; “

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 17

It must be noted that despite an interpretation of “report” not being provided

in Section 2, the relevant sections referring to reports have outlined the prerequisites

of the required reports in those sections itself as necessary.

In reference to the above interpretation in conjunction with the mentioned

requirement for complaints under Section 135, all that would be required is a written

or oral allegation made to the Magistrate by the public servant concerned or a public

servant to whom he is subordinate, made with the view of taking action action under

the Code that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offence.

In the instant case, the person is identified as the person who is alleged to have

committed an offence. It is my view that by the B report bearing no. B 44/2007, dated

01.01.2007 by the Complainant; the Officer in Charge of Wattegama Police station who

is the superior officer of the concerned public officer in the instant case, a written

complaint has indeed been made to the Magistrate with the view of taking action

under the Code by a public officer to whom the concerned police officer is subordinate.

The report outlines the related incident and the relevant surrounding circumstances

and includes the offences allegedly committed in sufficient detail. As such I find the

prerequisites of Section 135 (1)(a) have been fulfilled in the present instance.

While I am of the view that the above enumerated reasons suffice to satisfy the

Question of Law at hand concisely, I wish to further address relevant points raised by

both parties in order to comprehensively address this matter.

In substantiating their position, the Respondent relies on Section 39 of the

Judicature Act No.02 of 1978 in order to state that the petitioner is not entitled to

object at this point in proceedings as any objections must have been raised prior.

Section 39 of the Judicature Act is reproduced as follows for ease of reference:

“ Whenever any defendant or accused party shall have pleaded in any action,

proceeding or matter brought in any Court of First Instance neither party

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 17

shall afterwards be entitled to object to the jurisdiction of such court, but such

court shall be taken and held to have jurisdiction over such action,

proceeding or matter:

Provided that where it shall appear in the course of the proceedings that the

action, proceeding or matter was brought in a court having no jurisdiction

intentionally and with previous knowledge of the want of jurisdiction of such

court, the Judge shall be entitled at his discretion to refuse to proceed further

with the same, and to declare the proceedings null and void.”

The Respondent is of the position that as the Accused has only raised this objection

before this Court and has not made any endeavour to assert the same either before

the Magistrate or the High Court, this application cannot be entertained. The Accused

adopts the stance that as non-compliance with Section 135 (1)(a) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure amounts to a patent lack of jurisdiction which may be raised at any

point in proceedings, there was no reason for the Accused to take cognisance of

Section 39 of the Judicature Act.

As per Section 39 of the Judicature Act, any objection must be raised at the

earliest possible opportunity and the failure of this amounts to a waiver wherein the

court is considered to have jurisdiction over the action. However, it is commonly

accepted that in instances where it is a patent lack of jurisdiction, objection to

jurisdiction can be taken at any time in proceedings as was held in Baby V Banda

(1999) 3 Sri L R 416.

The landmark Judgement of Beatrice Perera Vs The Commissioner of

National Housing 77 N.L.R. 361 at p. 366, distinguished between “patent” and

“latent” lack of jurisdiction as follows:

“Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance that results in a judgment

or order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 17

Court may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it

may also lack competence because of failure to comply with such procedural

requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by the Court. Both

are jurisdictional defects ; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in

the law as a ' patent' or ' total' want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis

and the second a ' latent' or ' contingent' want of jurisdiction or a defectus

triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders

which are void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class

of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection

or acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this

being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a

tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation

to create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing

limits, both of which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the

proceedings in cases within this category are non coram judice and the

want of jurisdiction is incurable. In the other class of case, where the want

of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court will be

void only against the party on whom it operates but acquiescence, waiver or

inaction on the part of such person may estop him from making or

attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that the Court

was lacking in contingent jurisdiction...”

(Emphasis Added)

This approach has been adhered to and further developed by this Court as in

the case of Kekul Kotuwage Don Aruna Chaminda v Janashakthi General

Insurance Limited and others SC Appeal No. 134/2018 (SC minutes dated

09.10.2019) wherein a wealth of cases both before this Court itself as well as before

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 17

the Court of Appeal was acknowledged in terms of determining a question of

jurisdiction in the same case.

Given all expressed above, in the instance that non-compliance with Section 135

is considered a patent lack of jurisdiction, the juncture at which the objection to

jurisdiction is raised becomes an irrelevant consideration in contrast to it being a latent

lack of jurisdiction.

In order to ascertain the nature ascribed to want of sanctions, cases as

Kanagarajah v The Queen (1971) 74 NLR 378 considered the previous opinions of

Hon. Mosley S.P.J. in Brereton v. Ratranhamy (1940) 42 NLR 149 pertaining to

Section 425 of the previous Code of Criminal Procedure, which was identical to Section

537 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. A long line of decisions of the Privy Council

and of the Supreme Court of India had held that the absence of a complaint or sanction

as required by certain provisions is a defect which vitiates the proceedings and is not

an irregularity curable under s. 537 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code.

In the case of In re Subramaniam A. I. R. (1957) Madras 442 at 446, , Ramaswami,

J. stated that:

" The 'want' of a complaint as required by law will affect the 'competency' of

a magistrate to deal with a case and is not a curable error. The ' want' of a

sanction required under any provision of law will similarly affect the

competency of the Court and is not curable under this Section. But quite

different would be irregularities in sanctions granted and in such cases

irregularities in sanctions will be curable to the extent permissible under s.

537 Cr. P. C.

Thus a sharp distinction is drawn between initiation of proceedings

without sanction as required by the sections and irregularities in

sanctions granted, the former being a defect which vitiates the proceedings

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 17

ab initio and not an irregularity curable under s. 537 Cr. P. C. and the latter

sharing that of other irregularities of a like nature being curable to the extent

laid down in s. 537 Cr. P. C. To sum up, want of sanction cannot be cured

but irregularities in sanctions can be cured."

(Emphasis Added)

To clarify in considering the relevance of decisions based on the previous Code

of Criminal Procedure, similarly to Section 436 of the present Code, Section 425 of the

previous Code of Criminal Procedure provided that no judgment of a Court of

competent jurisdiction shall be reversed on appeal on account, inter alia, of the want

of any sanction required by section 147, unless such error, omission, irregularity, or

want has occasioned a failure of justice. It must be noted that Section 147 (a) of the

previous Code of Criminal Procedure Code is similar to Section 135 (1)(a) of the present

Code.

Thereinafter the case of Kanagarajah v The Queen (1971) 74 NLR 378

indicated that a non-compliance with requirements such as are contained in the

current Section 135(1) would not only taint a preliminary inquiry in the Magistrate's

Court where such an inquiry is held with a view to a committal for trial before a higher

Court, but it would also render the High Court not competent to have proceedings in

respect of such an offence. As such, a complete want of sanction or complaint would

amount to a patent lack of jurisdiction that may be raised before this Court despite

not having been considered before the Magistrate Court or the High Court previously.

In invoking Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, even if it were an

event of a want of sanction under Section 135, it is stated that:

“Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment passed by a

court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or

revision on account –

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 17

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint, summons,

warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other proceedings before or

during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a failure of

justice.”

As such the occasioning of a failure of justice owing to such lack of sanction must be

present in order to reverse or alter the judgment made in the instant case. As it stands

the sentencing of the Accused found the Accused guilty of the first and second count

and acquitting him on the third count, imposing fines of LKR 100 on the first count,

and LKR 1500 on the second count. The Maximum sentence allowed under Section

177 is punishment which may be simple imprisonment for a term which may extend

to six months, or with fine of one hundred rupees or with both. In the given

circumstances a fine of One Hundred Rupees is not intended to hinder the Accused

monetarily in any sense and I believe it is an entirely justified penalty for the crime he

is convicted of under Section 177.

Given that Section 135 solely pertains to the first count, the sentencing and fine

under the second count is not a relevant consideration before this Court. As a

complaint has been made in the form of a B report, a sanction is not necessary to the

filing of the present case before the Magistrate and the requirements under Section

135 (1)(a) have been sufficiently fulfilled, as such there is no necessity occasioning the

invoking of this provision in the instant case nor is there a failure of justice occasioned

by a lack of sanction, or by the non-revision of the decisions of the lower courts.

In the instant case I find that the B report bearing no. B 44/2007, dated 1st

January 2007 by the Complainant; the Officer in Charge of Wattegama Police station

amounts to compliance with Section 135 (1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and

SC Appeal No: 109/2017 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 17

I find no justifiable grounds to set aside the judgment delivered by the Magistrate

Court on 24th July 2015 or the order by the High Court of Kandy dated the 13th October

2016 dismissing the appeal, as there is no failure of justice warranting the exercise of

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As such, I find this Appeal dismissed

and I order cost of Ten Thousand Rupees to be paid by the Appellant.

Appeal Dismissed.
