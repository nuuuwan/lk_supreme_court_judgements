This is an appeal filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as Plaintiff) arising from the judgment of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province (Colombo), delivered in an appeal from the judgement of the District

Court of Gampaha. This matter was supported before this Court on 31.08.2015 and

leave was granted on the following questions of law referred to in paragraph 11(b) to

(f) of the Petition dated 27.02.2015 as follows:

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 17

b) The Learned High Court Judges have failed to consider the fact that

the Licensed Surveyor has very clearly stated that he has correctly

identified the land morefully described in the schedules to the plaint,

by the Plan marked P6 and the Report marked P7.

c) The Learned High Court Judges have failed to consider the fact that

the Licensed Surveyor has superimposed the plans marked P1 and P2

appearing in the plaint and came to the correct conclusion that Lot

No. 1 to 18 are the extent in the lands described in the schedules of

the plaint.

d) The Learned High Court Judges have failed to consider the plan

marked P6 and its Surveyor’s evidence with regard to the

identification of the land morefully described in the schedules of the

plaint and its effect.

e) The Honorable High Court Judges have erred in law by disregarding

the amicable partition by plan no.1286 marked P1 and the operative

part of the deed marked P3 and P5.

f) The Honorable High Court Judges have been misdirected and set

aside the entire judgement of the District Court of Gampaha whereas

the Defendant has not claimed any title to the land morefully

described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint.

Further, the Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as Defendant) raised incidental questions on the basis of which special

leave to appeal has been granted by this Court, are set out below;

1. Whether there was an issue before the District Court about the

amicable partition.

2. Whether the land which is the subject matter of this application has

been properly identified.

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 17

In answering this question of law, I find it pertinent to lay out the facts of the case

followed by an examination of the relevant provisions and concepts of law.

The Facts

The Plaintiff instituted this action bearing no. 34855/L in the District Court of

Gampaha on 13th February 1992 mainly for a declaration of title to the lands morefully

described in the 1st to 3rd schedules to the Plaint, for the ejectment of the Defendant

and for damages. Plaintiff stated by his Plaint as follows:

I. The Plaintiff asked for a declaration of title and ejectment of the Defendant

from the Lot No. 2 and 5 of “Nagahawatta” shown in plan no. 1286 marked

as ‘P1’ appears at page 183 of the brief marked as ‘X’.

II. The Plaintiff also prayed for a declaration of title and ejectment of the

Defendant from the paddy field called “Pokune Kumbura Pillewa and

Wewekumbura” of plan no. 1278 marked as ‘P2’ appears at page 185 of the

brief marked as ‘X’.

III. The Plaintiff stated that father of the Plaintiff, Mr. Mithreepala alias Mahinda

Nanayakkara became the owner of Lot No.2 of the said plan bearing no.

1286, land morefully depicted in the said plan no.1278 and the Lot no. 5 of

the plan marked bearing no.1286 by Deeds marked P3, P4 and P5

respectively.

IV. The said Mahinda Nanayakkara has died in 1984 and his estate was

administrated in the District Court of Colombo case bearing no. 29660/T and

his title devolved on the heirs of the deceased.

V. Thereafter the legal heirs of the said Mahinda Nanayakkara has transferred

their shares to the Plaintiff by deed marked P10.

VI. Then the Defendant unlawfully entered in to the lands on 15th of November

1991 morefully described in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Schedules of the Plaint.

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 17

As discussed above, the Plaintiff set out her title to the said lands emanating from

said Mahinda Nanayakkara and claimed that the Defendant together with his parents

and family had entered the land in or about 1991 and constructed a house thereon

and is in illegal and unlawful possession of the land since such time.

The Defendant filed answer denying the averments contained in the Plaint and set

out his chain of title to the said land by pleading inter alia that his father Rajathewa

Mohotti Appuhamilage Wijesinghe had derived title from the deeds marked V3 to V7

commencing from the years 1961 to 1976 to the land, which is morefully described in

the schedule to the answer, and after demise of his father, he together with his family

members inherited the same. The Defendant also claimed that he had acquired a

prescriptive title and prayed for a dismissal of the Plaintiff’s action.

Thereafter the case was fixed for trial and after the trial the learned Judge of the

District Court answered the issues in favour of the Plaintiff and entered the judgment

accordingly.

Thus the Defendant had preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province (Civil Appeals) holden at Gampaha. The learned High Court Judges

delivered the judgment on 19.01.2015 dismissing the Plaintiff’s action based on the

non-identification of the land, differences in the superimposition, amicable partition

of the land among other such grounds.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province (Civil Appeals) Holden at Gampaha the Plaintiff has filed a Petition dated 27th

February 2015 before this Court, and leave was granted as has been specified above.

Questions of Law raised

Upon perusal of the facts, I find it pertinent to summarize the Questions of law

raised in this case into two main issues as identification of the corpus and the issue of

amicable partition.

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 17

However as there are five specific questions of law, I find it pertinent to answer

each question of law giving due consideration to the circumstances pertaining to each,

in this case this can more comprehensively achieved by firstly answering the 4th

question of law.

In a declaration of title or rei vindicatio action, if the subject matter is admitted no

further proof of the identity of the corpus is required, for no party is burdened with

adducing further proof of an admitted fact. The subject matter of this action is set out

in the plaint and the Defendant in his answer sought a declaration of title in his favour

for the premises from which the Plaintiff wanted him ejected.

The Plaintiff in this case prayed for a declaration of title to three contiguous

allotments of lands described in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd schedules to the Plaint. These three

contiguous lands are described and depicted in two plans bearing No.1286 dated

12.4.1983 prepared by T.A. Ranasinghe Thambugalla Licensed Surveyor, which was

marked as P-1 and Plan No.1278 dated 16.3.1983 prepared by T.A. Ranasinghe

Thambugalla Licensed Surveyor, which was marked as P-2 in the course of the trial.

Lands described in the 1st and 3rd Schedules to the Plaint refers to Plan P-1 (depicted

as Lot 2 and 5 respectively) and the land in the 2nd Schedule refers to Plan marked P-

2.

Plaintiff stated that the Plaintiff’s predecessor, Mahinda Nanayakkara obtained

title to the said three allotments of land from three different deeds. Title to the land

described in the first schedule to the plaint, namely Lot No. 2 in Plan marked P-1 was

obtained by Deed No.4007 marked as P-3 and the title to the land described in the

second schedule in P-2 was obtained by Deed No.4004 marked as P-4. Title to the land

described in the third schedule namely Lot 5 in P-1 was obtained by Deed No.4006

marked as P-5.

Accordingly, the said three contiguous allotments of land were owned by the

said Mahinda Nanayakkara in 1983 by the said three deeds marked P-3, P-4 and P-5,

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 17

all executed in the same year. As per the said Deeds, the vendors in Deed P-3 and P-5

had amicably partitioned the land described in the first schedule in both deeds and

Lot 2 had been allotted to one Raja Thewa Mohotti Appuhamilage Edwin Singho in

lieu of his undivided 31/72 shares and Lot 5 in that plan which was allotted to 8 persons

having undivided shares, being heirs of one Raja Thewa Mohotti Appuhamilage Don

Juanis Appuhamy, was later turned into a divided and defined allotment as a result of

the amicable partition done by the said Plan P-1. Hence, Plaintiff claimed that common

ownership had been terminated since 1983.

Defendant in his answer pleaded title to a land called “Nagahawatte” described in the

schedule to the Answer which described as follows;

“බස්නාහිර පළාතේ ගම්පහ දිස්ික්කතේ සියනෑ තකෝරතළ් මැද පේුතේ

කිරිවාතේගම යන ගම තිතබන නාගහවේත කියන වී බුසල් තදකක පමණ

වපසරියට මායිම්;

උුරට ගී කියන අප්පු සිට සහ තව අයට අයිති ඉඩමද, නැතගනහිරට එම අප්පු

සිිංඤ ෝ ට අයිති තපාකුතේ කුඹුරද, දකුණට අඹතගාඩ ලියනතේ ලවනිස් අප්පුට

සහ තව අයට අයිති වේතද, බස්නාහිරට ගී කියන අප්පු සිිංඤ ෝට අයිති වේතද,

යන තම් ුල පිහිටි ගහතකාළ පලුරු ආදී සියලු තේේ තේ. “

For the purpose of reference, the English translation of the above paragraph is

reproduced as follows;

“Nagahawatta in the village of Kiriwanegama in the middle of

Siyane Korale in the Gampaha District of the Western Province

borders about two bushels of paddy; trees and plantations

standing thereon and bounded as;

on the North by land of Geekiyanage Appusingho and others, East

by Pokunekumbura of the said Appusingho, South by land of

Ambegoda Liyanage Lawanis Appu and others, West by land of

Geekiyanage Appu Singho..”

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 17

According to the said description of the land, Nagahawatte is a land of about 2 Bushels

paddy sowing and the original owner to the same land had been one Raja Thewa

Mohotti Appuhamilage Baron Seneviratne alias Appuhamy who was the paternal

grandfather of the Defendant.

Plaintiff in order to establish the chain of title to the land called Nagahawatte adduced

the Deed marked P-3 which had been executed in 1983 and the part A of the Schedule

therein describes a land of two Bushels as follows.

“The land called Nagahawatta situated at Thiriwanegama in Meda

Pattu of Siyane Korale in the District of Gampaha (Formerly District

of Colombo) Western Province and bounded on the North by land of

Geekiyanage Appusingho and others, East by Pokunekumbura of the

said Appusingho, South by land of Ambegoda Liyanage Lawanis Appu

and others, West by land of Geekiyanage Appu Singho, containing in

extent about two Bushels of Paddy sowing ground and registered

under E 205/106. “

With these translations, it appears that the land claimed by the Defendant based

on his title deeds in the answer is almost identical to the land claimed by the Plaintiff

morefully described in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint, albeit in a different language.

In the recitals of P-3 it describes the Vendor’s title and pedigree as follows;

“I, Raja Thewa Mohotti Appuhamilage Edwin Singho of…………. (………..

vendor) am the owner of an undivided 31/72 share of the land and

premises described in the Schedule A hereto under and by virtue of

Deed of Gift No.6800 dated 31st October 1961 attested by D.F.S.

Wijayasinghe Notary Public.

Whereas I the said Vendor have amicably partitioned the said

premises described in Schedule A hereto with the other co-owners of

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 17

the said premises according to Plan No. 1286 dated 12th April 1983

made by T.A. Ranasinghe Thambugala Licensed Surveyor.

And whereas I the said Vendor for and in lieu of my 31/72 share of

the said premises described in the schedule A hereto have been

allotted and am in possession of Lot 2 depicted in the said Plan of the

said premises which said Lot 2 is described in the schedule B hereto

and is hereinafter referred to as the said premises: “

Part B of the Schedule of the said Deed marked P-3 depicts the transferred property

to the predecessor of the Plaintiff as follows.

“All that Lot 2 depicted in the said Plan No.1286 dated 12th April 1983

made by T.A. Ranasinghe Thambugala Licensed Surveyor of the land

called Nagahamulawatta described in the Schedule Schedule A hereto

and situated at Thiriwanegama aforesaid which said Lot 2 is bounded

according to the said Plan on the North-East by Lot 1, South-East by

field of R.M.A. Wijesinghe and others, South-West by Lots 5,4 and 3,

North-West by land of R.N.A. Karunaratne, containing in extent one

rood and five decimal eight five perches (A.0-R.1-P.05.85). “

As per the above mentioned facts it can be observed that the land described in

the Answer of the Defendant is identical to the land described and claimed by the

Plaintiff as per the Deed marked P-3 in boundaries as well as in extents. Further, the

vendor of the said P-3 had only transferred a lesser extent which is described in the

Part B of the Schedule to the P-3 on the basis that in lieu of his undivided share, he

together with the other co-owners had amicably divided the land and he had become

entitle to Lot 2 of Plan P-1.

However, it must be noted that there was no deed produced to establish the

fact that the co-ownership had come to an end in the year 1983 and there was hardly

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 17

any time for the said portion of the land to be acquired by a separate entity at the time

of instituting the action as the action had been instituted in the year 1992 before a ten

years’ period had lapsed.

As per the page 81 of the brief, T.A. Ranasinghe Thambugalla Licensed Surveyor

was called as a witness to give evidence in the trial. In his evidence he was questioned

regarding Survey Plan No.1286 dated 12.4.1983 (P-1) prepared by him and he

specifically stated that he does not possess any document to prove that the other co-

owners have given their consent for the preparation of P-1 or the other co-owners

were present when the amicable partition was done. The relevant portion was re-

produced as follows;

ප්‍ර : නමුේ ඒ පාර්ශවකරුවේ තම් ඉඩම තබදා තවේ කර ගේන කැමතියි කියලා,

කිසිම අේසනක් සඳහේ තවලා නැහැ?

උ : නැහැ.

ප්‍ර : පාර්ශවකරුවේතේ එකගේවය උඩ එකඟවුනා කියලා තමානම සාක්ියක්වේ

නැහැ.

උ : නැහැ.

For the purpose of reference, English translation of the above paragraph is as follows;

Q- But there is no signature that those parties want to divide this

land?

A-No.

Q- There is no evidence that the parties agreed on the agreement.

A-No.

With the said testimony, it is irrelevant to apply the amicable partition entered

between the parties by Plan no.1286 marked P1 and the operative part of the Deed

marked P3 and P5 as these were entered without the representation of all co-owners

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 17

who are legally entitle to the ownership of this land. Hence, I answer the 4th question

of law negatively.

The Defendant in his answer averred that he is in possession of the said land

described in the schedule to his answer and that the original owner of it was one Raja

Thewa Mohotti Appuhamilage Don Baron Seneviratne who transferred an undivided

31/72 share to one R.M.A. Wijesinghe (Defendant’s father) by Deed No. 6814 dated

6.11.1961 (V-3), who in turn transferred same to one K.P. Somapla by Deed No.15562

dated 10.12.1969 (V-4) and said Somapala re-transferred same to said R.M.A.

Wijesinghe (Defendant’s father) by Deed of Transfer No.475 dated 10.8.1970 (V-5).

Said Wijesinghe by Deed of Transfer No.476 dated 10.8.1970 (V-6) transferred the

same to the said Somapala and said Somapla by Deed No. 5327 dated 2.11.1976 (V-7)

to the Defendant’s father R.M.A. Wijesinghe who died intestate without any further

transfers and hence the property was inherited by his wife and his children including

the Defendant and four others as legal heirs of the said deceased Wijesinghe.

Defendant further claimed that he was in possession of that land, and averred that the

Plaintiff’s action be dismissed with costs.

In the course of the trial Plaintiff’s brother namely, Gurunnaselage Vijith

Priyantha Wimalathunga gave evidence since he was the person who looked after the

land described in the 1st-3rd schedules to the Plaint. Title Deeds which were discussed

above were marked and the Survey Plan bearing No. 1333 dated 12.03.1997 prepared

by R.M.J. Ranasinghe Licensed Surveyor was marked as P-6 where both lands depicted

in P-1 and P-2 were surveyed and superimposed. Under cross-examination R.M.J.

Ranasinghe Licensed Surveyor had admitted the fact that he could not identify the

lands which are described in the schedule to the Plaint, but he had depicted a land

which was shown to him by the Plaintiff (page 73 of the brief).

A-Yes.

Q- You have done as the plaintiffs have shown.

A-Yes. (Those parts are marked as V-2.)

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 17

In this context, though the Plaintiff relied on the P6 and P7, I am of the view

that the Licensed Surveyor has not correctly identified the land morefully described in

the schedules to the Plaint, by the Plan marked P6 and the Report marked P7.

The action for a declaration of title has been considered in several landmark

decisions in Sri Lanka. As it was held in Wanigaratne Vs. Juwanis Appuhamy (65

NLR 167), “it is trite law that Plaintiff should set out his title on the basis on which he

claims a declaration of title to the land. The burden rests on the Plaintiff to prove that

title”.

Further, in Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef and V. Abdul Majeed Mohamed

Mansoor and Another (2010 2SLR 333) it was held as follows;

“It is trite law that the identity of the property with respect to which

a vindicatory action is instituted is a fundamental to the success of

the action as the proof of the ownership (dominion) of the owner

(dominus). Where the property sought to be vindicated consists of a

land, the land sought to be vindicated must be identified by reference

to a survey plan or other equally expeditions method. In a rei

vindicatio action, it is not necessary to consider whether the

defendant has any title or right to possession, where the plaintiff has

failed to establish his title to the land sought to be vindicated, the

action ought to be dismissed without more.”

As enumerated above to succeed in a rei vindication action, the owner must

prove on a balance of probabilities, not only his or her ownership in the property, but

also that the property exists and is clearly identifiable. The identity of the land is

fundamental for the purpose of attributing ownership, and for ordering ejectment. In

the present case, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title of the

property to the subject matter in dispute. Hence, I answer the 2nd and 3rd questions of

law negatively.

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 17

Further, R.M.J. Ranasinghe Licensed Surveyor further states in his evidence that

the land surveyed by him is in excess of 2 Roods and 11 Perches.

ප්‍ර : ඔබ විස්තර කරල තිතබන ඉඩම අක්කර 1 රූඩ් 2 පර්චස් 32.53 ක්.

උ : ඔේ.

ප්‍ර : රූඩ් තදකයි පර්චස් 11ක් විතර ඔබතේ පිඹුතර් වැඩියි ඉඩම් තකාටස?

උ : ඔේ.

For the purpose of reference, the English translation of the above paragraph is as

follows;

Q- The land you have described is 1 Acre 2 Roods and 32.53 Perches.

A-Yes.

Q- Do you have more than 2 Roods and 11 Perches of land in your

plan?

A-Yes.

In this context Plaintiff has failed to prove how the extent increased by a

substantial amount at a time when there was a plan prepared 9 years ago (i.e., 1983).

Further as per the Plaintiff’s Predecessor’s Testamentary proceedings before the

District Court of Colombo, the Inventory filed on behalf of the late Mr. Mahinda

Nanayakkara listed three immovable properties under the list of property described as

follows:

1. කළතගඩිතහ්න (අ.0-රූ.0-ප.3.38)- Kalagedihena (A0-R0-P3.38)

2. නාගහවේත (අ.0-රූ.0-ප.11.75)-Nagahawatta (A0-RO-P11.75)

3. නාගහවේත (අ.0-රූ.1-ප.5.85)-Nagahawatta (A0-R1-P5.85)

Hence, there is a clear difference in between the Survey Plan bearing No. 1333

dated 12.03.1997 prepared by R.M.J. Ranasinghe Licensed Surveyor and the Inventory

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 17

filed on behalf of the late Mr. Mahinda Nanayakkara. In this context I answer the 1st

question of law negatively.

Finally, I find that the 5th question of law cannot stand upon answering all above

questions in the negative. Ultimately, as all necessary elements for a remedy have

failed, there is no salvageable section of the District Court Judgment that the High

Court could have preserved in favour of the Defendant. As such I answer the 5th

question of law negatively.

Prescription

In view of my answers to the substantive questions of law raised on which

special leave has been granted by this Court, it is unnecessary to decide which is

whether learned District Judge has not duly evaluated the evidence on the question of

prescription as stated in the 8th paragraph of his Answer adduced by the Defendant.

Further issue of prescription has not been raised as a substantive question of law

before this Court when this matter was considered for granting of leave. I therefore do

not wish to go into this question in depth. In a rei vindicatio action, it is not necessary

to consider whether the defendant has any title or right to possession, where the

plaintiff has failed to establish his title to the land sought to be vindicated and the

action ought to be dismissed without more.

Decision

In all the circumstances of this case, I dismiss the appeal answering negatively,

for the substantive questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on which special leave had been granted

by this Court. I am of the view that the learned trial judge had misdirected herself when

she arrived at the conclusion that the Plaintiff had established the chain of title to the

land and therefore, the judgment is erroneous. Hence, I am of the view that the

judgment entered in the High Court dismissing the Plaintiff’s action is correct in law in

a context where the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title to the land which he claimed.

SC Appeal 146/2015 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 17

In these circumstances I affirm the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

dismiss this Appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
