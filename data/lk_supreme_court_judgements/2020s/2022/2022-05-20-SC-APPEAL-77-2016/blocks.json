It also hopes the charges can be reduced finally and that remittance will be arranged on 09-10-2008. The aforesaid four e-mails, P1A, P1B, P1C and P1D dispatched on 08-10-2008, prima facie appears to demonstrate that a contract was entered into between the parties referred to therein. Furthermore, the said e-mails point to the fact, that the contract was entered into on 08-10-2008, the material date referred to in issue two raised by the plaintiff at the trial. The fundamental rudiments of a contract is meeting of minds i.e., an offer and an acceptance. Thus, from the said e-mails dispatched on 08-10-2008, it appears that P1A was the offer and P1D the acceptance. The offer or the quotation given was as agents only and was to supply fresh water for the consideration therein to a ship in distress and the confirmation was clear and specific and was unconditional. P1C dispatched by the plaintiff indicates that the plaintiff was aware of the principal. It was a named and a disclosed principal and the plaintiff directly corresponded with the principal and informed the duration of the journey and the earliest time the plaintiff could leave. i.e., 09-10-2008, day time [as opposed to early morning hours referred to in P1A since the vessel was engaged in some work on the night of 08-10-2008]. This e-mail was followed by P1D, whereby the owner accepted the quotation. Thus, upon a plain reading of those e-mails, it is apparent that an offer was made and it was accepted on 08-10-2008, within 3 hours of the initial request.",

The district judge went on to observe that since the mail P3B dispatched on 10-10-2008, which read we will compensate additional payment, follows P10, P3C and P3A, that the plaintiff and the defendant were the only parties privy to the contract of supplying fresh water and went onto conclude that the defendant has taken the contract from the managers of Marina and entered into a different contract with Captain Weerasinghe which the defendant has not honored as promised. In my view, this finding of the district court is conjecture and is based upon surmises and does not stem from the issues raised nor founded on any evidence led at the trial and for that reason and that reason alone is devoid of merit and reasoning.",
