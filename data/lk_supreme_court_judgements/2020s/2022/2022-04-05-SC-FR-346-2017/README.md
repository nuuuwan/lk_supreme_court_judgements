Argued on: 03rd of June, 2020

Decided on: 05th of April, 2022

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

Facts of the Application

The 1st petitioner, who is the father of the 2nd and 3rd petitioners, filed the instant application

on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd petitioners, who were students in Grade 7 and Grade 3 of Vidyartha

College, Kandy, respectively.

The petitioners alleged that the inaction on the part of the 4th respondent to take appropriate

action against the alleged harassment caused to the 2nd and 3rd petitioners, and the failure of the

1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 5th respondents to take appropriate and timely remedial action against the

purported inaction of the 4th respondent, resulted in the violation of the Fundamental Rights of

the 2nd and 3rd petitioners enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The 1st petitioner stated that in January 2016, he objected to the appointment of an individual

to the post of treasurer of the Parents Committee of Vidyartha College made by the 2nd

petitioners class teacher (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the said class teacher) as he

was aware of previous corrupt practices of the proposed treasurer.

The 1st petitioner stated that, approximately two weeks after the said incident, the 2nd petitioner

had been beaten by the said class teacher. The 1st petitioner further stated that despite the

4

complaints made by him regarding the said incident to the 4th respondent, who was the then

principal of Vidyartha College, no action had been taken by him against the said class teacher.

Further, the 1st petitioner stated that on the 16th of February, 2016, the said class teacher had

threatened to kill the 2nd petitioner after accusing him of beating another student. Thus, the 1st

petitioner had once again complained to the 4th respondent about the said incident, and had

lodged a complaint at the Kandy Police station regarding the harassment caused to the 2nd

petitioner by the said class teacher.

The 1st petitioner stated that subsequently, the teachers in Vidyartha College had begun to ill-

treat the 3rd petitioner, his younger son.

Thereafter, the 1st petitioner had made complaints to the 1st, 3rd and 6th respondents regarding

the harassment caused to the 2nd petitioner by the said class teacher and the inaction of the 4th

respondent to take steps in respect of the said complaints against her.

Moreover, the 1st petitioner had lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission

regarding the alleged inaction of the 4th respondent to take action against the said harassment

caused to the 2nd and 3rd petitioners.

The 1st petitioner further stated that during the parents-teachers meeting held on the 30th of

March, 2017, the 4th respondent had requested other parents of students at the said school to

defend the said class teacher against false allegations made by the 2nd petitioner.

Moreover, the 1st petitioner stated that the Assistant Principal and two other teachers of the said

school had assaulted the 2nd petitioner, while several other parents had assaulted his wife on

the 5th of April, 2017. The 1st petitioner stated that the 2nd petitioner and his mother were

hospitalised as a result of the said incident.

Consequently, the 1st petitioner had once again lodged a complaint at the Kandy Police station

and the Human Rights Commission stating that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners had refused to attend

school due to the aforementioned assault.

The 1st petitioner further stated that a consultant psychiatrist had recommended that the 2nd and

3rd petitioners should be transferred to a different school as they were experiencing trauma

from being ill-treated at Vidyartha College.

5

The 1st petitioner stated that he was informed by the Education Department of the Central

Province on the 5th of July, 2017, that steps were being taken to issue a charge sheet against

the said class teacher.

Moreover, the Human Rights Commission, after holding an inquiry in respect of the complaint

made by the 1st petitioner, had, by letter dated 13th of July, 2017, requested the 1st respondent

to provide a suitable alternative school for the 2nd and 3rd petitioners situated in close proximity

to the petitioners residence. Accordingly, the 1st, 3rd and 5th respondents had informed

Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College to admit the 2nd and 3rd petitioners.

Thereafter, the 1st petitioner had informed the Human Rights Commission and had sent letters

to the 1st and 3rd respondents stating that the suggested alternative school was of a lower

academic standard than Vidyartha College and was situated further away from the petitioners

residence than other suitable schools in the area, such as St. Sylvesters College. Thus, the 1st

petitioner had contended that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners should be given admission to a better

school such as St. Sylvesters College.

In the circumstances, it was stated that the inaction of the 4th respondent to take appropriate

action in respect of the alleged harassment caused to the 2nd and 3rd petitioners, and the failure

of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 5th respondents to take appropriate action against the purported inaction

of the 4th respondent, resulted in the 2nd and 3rd petitioners being unable to attend Vidyartha

College, thereby violating the Fundamental Rights of the 2nd and 3rd petitioners guaranteed by

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

After the application was supported, the court had granted leave to proceed for the alleged

violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Objections of the 1st respondent

The 1st respondent filed objections and stated that in January 2016, the said class teacher had

caned the 2nd petitioner to discipline him as he had harassed new students who had joined Grade

6 of Vidyartha College pursuant to the scholarship examination.

The 1st respondent further stated that in response to the complaint made by the 1st petitioner

against the alleged harassment caused to the 2nd petitioner by the said class teacher in January

2016, the 4th respondent had promptly directed the said class teacher to stop using corporal

punishment to discipline the 2nd petitioner.

6

Further, in February 2016, in response to the 1st petitioners second complaint alleging that the

said class teacher threatened to kill the 2nd petitioner, the 4th respondent had taken steps to

remove her from the said post of class teacher. Further, she had been removed from teaching

the subject of practical technical skills in the 2nd petitioners class and a different class had

been assigned to her.

The 1st respondent stated that he had received a letter on the 1st of June, 2016 from the 1st

petitioner alleging the harassment caused to the 2nd petitioner by the said class teacher.

Consequently, the 1st respondent had appointed a committee on the 9th of June, 2016 to conduct

a preliminary inquiry into the alleged harassment of the 2nd petitioner.

Further, the 1st respondent denied the 1st petitioners allegation that the 4th respondent had

requested other parents of the students to defend the said class teacher during a parents-teachers

meeting held on the 30th of March, 2017. Moreover, it was also denied that the Assistant

Principal and two other teachers of Vidyartha College had assaulted the 2nd petitioner and that

some parents of students had assaulted the 2nd petitioners mother on the 5th of April, 2017. He

further denied that the teachers in the said school had ill-treated the 3rd petitioner.

It was further stated that, consequent to a complaint made by the 1st petitioner, the Human

Rights Commission had requested the 1st respondent to provide a suitable school for the 2nd

and 3rd petitioners in close proximity to the petitioners residence by letter dated 13th of July,

2017.

Accordingly, the 1st, 3rd and 5th respondents had taken a decision to admit the 2nd and 3rd

petitioners to Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College in August, 2017 and had informed the

principal of the said college accordingly.

The 1st respondent denied the 1st petitioners claim that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners had not been

provided with a suitable alternative school and stated that Vidyartha College and Wariyapola

Sri Sumangala College are of a similar academic standard as both schools fall under 1AB

category and that the distance between the two aforementioned schools is approximately 100

meters.

Moreover, it was stated that even though the 1st petitioner requested for the 2nd and 3rd

petitioners to be admitted to St. Sylvesters College, the 2nd petitioner had only obtained 169

marks at the scholarship examination, which was lower than the cut-off mark of 174 required

to gain admission to St. Sylvesters College.

7

Further, the 1st respondent stated that the said class teacher was transferred to St. Sylvesters

College and was serving in the said school at the time the 1st petitioner made the request to

transfer the 2nd and 3rd petitioners to the said school. Therefore, it is evident that their motive

in filing the instant application was to gain admission to St. Sylvesters College.

Moreover, the 1st respondent stated that at the time of filing his objections, a charge sheet dated

31st of December, 2017 was issued against the said class teacher for the harassment of the 2nd

petitioner.

The 1st respondent further stated that a student who fails to attend a school for 40 consecutive

days without notice is considered as having left the school in terms of the circulars issued by

the Ministry of Education. However, despite the failure of the 2nd and 3rd petitioners to attend

school without any notice since the 5th of April, 2017, their names had not been removed from

the school register. Hence, it is apparent that the said school had acted in the best interests of

the 2nd and 3rd petitioners.

It was further stated that, taking into consideration the abovementioned facts, the respondents

had taken appropriate remedial action regarding the complaints made against the alleged

harassment faced by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners, and as such, they had not violated the

Fundamental Rights of the 2nd and 3rd petitioners guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution.

Subsequently, by way of a motion, the respondents produced the preliminary inquiry report,

the charge sheet, the disciplinary inquiry report and the disciplinary order made against the said

class teacher for the alleged harassment of the 2nd petitioner, marked as X1, X2, X3 and

X4, respectively.

At the time of the hearing of the instant application, the learned counsel for the petitioner

informed court that the petitioners would only pursue the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (e)

and (h) of the petition which states as follows;

(e) Declare that the refusal and/or failure of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 5th

respondents to take appropriate and timely remedial action against the 4th

respondent constitutes an infringement and/ or a continuing infringement

of the Petitioners Fundamental Right to equality before the law and equal

protection of the law protected by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

8

(h) Declare that the refusal and/or failure of the 4th respondent to address the

complaints made on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd petitioner which subsequently

caused them to refrain from attending Vidyartha College constitutes an

infringement and/or a continuing infringement of the Petitioners

Fundamental Right to equality before the law and equal protection of the

law protected by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Have the 2nd and 3rd petitioners Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution been infringed?

In view of the abovementioned prayers to the petition, it needs to be considered whether there

was an inaction on the part of the 4th respondent to take action in respect of the complaints of

harassment under reference, and whether there was a failure on the part of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or

5th respondents to take appropriate and timely remedial action against the purported inaction of

the 4th respondent.

The 1st petitioner stated that after he objected to the appointment of an individual to the post of

treasurer of the Parents Committee of Vidyartha College by the said class teacher, she had

assaulted the 2nd petitioner, in January 2016. Thereafter, on the 16th of February, 2016, the

petitioner stated that the said class teacher had threatened to kill the 2nd petitioner for allegedly

beating another student.

The 1st petitioner stated that despite the complaints made by him regarding the aforementioned

incidents, no action was taken by the 4th respondent against the said class teacher.

The material furnished to this court shows that after the first complaint of the 1st petitioner

alleging that the said class teacher had caned the 2nd petitioner, the 4th respondent had directed

her to refrain from using corporal punishment to discipline the 2nd petitioner.

Further, after the second complaint where it was alleged that the said class teacher had

threatened to kill the 2nd petitioner, the 4th respondent had removed her from the post of class

teacher and from teaching the subject of practical training skills in the 2nd petitioners class.

Moreover, upon receiving a letter from the 1st petitioner on the 1st of June, 2016, the 1st

respondent had appointed a committee on the 9th of June, 2016 to conduct a preliminary inquiry

into the alleged harassment caused to the 2nd petitioner by the said class teacher. The 4th

9

respondent has facilitated the holding of the said preliminary inquiry against the said class

teacher.

Pursuant to the findings of the preliminary inquiry, the 1st petitioner had been informed, by

letter dated 5th of July, 2017, that steps were being taken to issue a charge sheet against the said

class teacher by the Education Department of the Central Province.

Subsequently, a charge sheet dated 31st of December, 2017 had been issued by the 1st

respondent against the said class teacher in respect of the alleged harassments caused to the 2nd

petitioner.

Consequently, an inquiring officer had been appointed to conduct the disciplinary inquiry

against the said class teacher on the 28th of April, 2018, and the said disciplinary inquiry had

been conducted from the 05th of July, 2018 to 06th of September, 2018.

Thereafter, the disciplinary inquiry report dated 2nd of October, 2018 had been submitted by

the inquiring officer. The said report stated that the said class teacher was found guilty of all

charges by the inquiring officer.

Consequently, by a disciplinary order dated 21st of November, 2018, her salary increments

were deferred for two years. Further, the said class teacher, who was then serving in St.

Sylvesters College, Kandy, was given a punishment transfer to CP/W/Kengalla Maha

Vidyalaya, by letter dated 11th of December, 2018.

Moreover, even though the 1st petitioner stated that the 4th respondent had requested other

parents of the students to defend the said class teacher against false allegations made by the 2nd

petitioner, no material was produced in court to substantiate the said allegation.

Further, although the 1st petitioner stated that a police complaint was lodged when certain

teachers and parents of Vidyartha College allegedly assaulted his wife and the 2nd petitioner on

the 5th of April, 2017, a copy of the said police complaint was not produced in this court.

Conclusion

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that appropriate and timely remedial action had been

taken against the said class teacher by the disciplinary authority in terms of the procedure

stipulated in the Establishments Code.

10

Hence, I am of the view that there is no inaction on the part of the 4th respondent to take action

in respect of the complaints of harassment under reference. In view of the aforementioned

findings, the question of whether there was a failure on the part of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 5th

respondents to take timely and appropriate remedial action against the purported inaction of

the 4th respondent does not need further consideration by this court.

Thus, I hold that the respondents have not violated the Fundamental Rights of the 2nd and 3rd

petitioners enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

In the foregoing circumstances, the petition is dismissed with no costs.
