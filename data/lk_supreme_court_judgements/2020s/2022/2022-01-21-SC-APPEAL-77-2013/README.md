The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (later substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent- Respondent and hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted this action in the District Court of Kurunegala, seeking to

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

4

partition a land called Udawattehena in an extent of three seers of

Kurakkan, according to the pedigree and the share entitlement of each

party, as described in paragraph 11 of his second amended plaint of

12.12.1996. The Plaintiff, whilst claiming an entitlement of share of

the corpus to himself on paternal inheritance, allocated share each to

the 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Appellants and conceding only to

a life interest of the 1st Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (later

substituted by 1a and 1b Defendant-Appellant-Appellants and 2nd and

3rd Defendant-Appellant- Appellants, and hereinafter referred to as the

1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants respectively).

It is averred by the Plaintiff that the original owners of the corpus

are Ukku Naide and Punchi Naide who transferred their rights of the

corpus to Kirihapuwa by deed No. 11680 of 05.06.1885. When Kirihapuwa

died without a will, his title to the corpus had devolved on his two sons,

Singna (isx[d) and Amangira, who inherited share each thereof. The

Plaintiff claimed his share from Singna on paternal inheritance. In

describing the devolution of title of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in the

plaint, the Plaintiff averred that one Menika had acquired a of the

remaining share of the corpus from Amangira on deed No. 15854 of

05.08.1938 and had thereafter transferred that share of the corpus to

the 1st Defendant, on deed No. 43039 of 23.07.1954. The 1st Defendant

had later transferred her title in favour of the 3rd Defendant on deed No.

6118 of 28.06.1984, subject to her life interest. The other share of the

corpus was inherited by Juwanis alias Jeewa from Amangira. Juwanis had

thereupon transferred his share to the 2nd Defendant, on deed No.

6117 of 28.06.1984.

The said three Defendants, by their common Statement of Claim,

conceded that Singna and Amangira have inherited share each of the

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

5

corpus from Kirihapuwa. They did not dispute the identity of the corpus.

However, they sought dismissal of the partition action instituted by the

Plaintiff on the basis that, contrary to the claim of the Plaintiff, Singna

had mortgaged his share, which had subsequently been bought over

by D.B. Welagedara and M.D.Banda at an auction. The Defendants

further claim that it was these two, who placed the 1st Defendant in

possession of the corpus, sometime in 1972. The 1st Defendant had

thereupon claimed she had acquired prescriptive title over the rights of

the Plaintiff by long possession. They also assert that the Plaintiff never

was in possession of the land.

The parties have suggested a total of twelve points of contest. Of

the eight points of contest suggested by the 1st to 3rd Defendants, only

points of contest Nos. 7 and 11 had been formulated in relation to the

rights of the 1st Defendant. Point of contest No. 7 is in effect of whether

lot Nos. 1 and 2 depicted in the preliminary plan were cultivated and

possessed by her, while point of contest No. 11 was to the effect

whether the plaint should be dismissed upon the acquisition of

prescriptive title by the 1st Defendant against the right of the Plaintiff,

which had devolved through Singna.

The trial Court had answered both these points of contest, i.e.

Nos. 7 and 11, against the 1st Defendant as she did not prove any ouster.

In delivering its judgment, the Court had allocated share of the

corpus to the Plaintiff, whilst allocating share each to the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants, upon acceptance of the pedigree, as averred in the plaint.

The 1st to 3rd Defendants, have thereupon preferred an appeal against

the said judgment to the High Court of Civil Appeal, before which they

unsuccessfully challenged the said judgment solely on the basis that the

Plaintiff had failed to establish that he is the legitimate son of Singna.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

6

They further contended that since parties are subjected to Kandyan law

and in the absence of proof that the marriage between the Plaintiffs

parents, namely, Singna and Kiribindu was registered, that factor would

make the Plaintiff an illegitimate child of Singna. On that account, the

1st to 3rd Defendants contend that the Plaintiff has no entitlement to

inherit his fathers Paraveni property.

In dismissing the appeal of the 1st to 3rd Defendants, the High

Court of Civil Appeal had held that since the 1st Defendant had failed to

put in an issue on the question of legitimacy of the Plaintiff and

therefore the trial Court was not called upon to determine that claim. It

also held that the Plaintiff is the son of Singna and Kiribindu and the 1st

Defendant, who contracted a Deega marriage, is not entitled to any

rights over the corpus. Court further concluded that she had failed to

establish her claim of acquisition of prescriptive title.

Being aggrieved by that judgment, the 1st to 3rd Defendants have

moved this Court, seeking leave to appeal on several questions of law.

On 29.05.2013, this Court having afforded a hearing to the parties,

thought it fit and proper to grant leave to appeal against the judgment

of the High Court of Civil Appeal, on several questions of law, as set

out in paragraph 10(i), (ii) and (iii) of the petition of the Defendants,

dated 18.02.2013.

The questions of law, that had been formulated by Defendants, as

contained in sub paragraphs 10(i),(ii) and (iii) of their petition, are as

follows:

1. Has the High Court of Civil Appeal erred and misdirected

itself in law as regards a burden of proof in relation to the title

of the Plaintiff?

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

7

2. Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider that the

Learned District Judge has failed to investigate the title of the

Plaintiff as per the provisions of the Partition Law?

3. Has the High Court of Civil Appeal misdirected itself on the

question of whether the said property is Paraveni Property or

not in view of the provisions of section 10(1)(a) of the

Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Act?

At the hearing of the appeal, learned Presidents Counsel for the

Defendants contended that with the death of Singna without a will, his

share entitlement to the corpus has become Paraveni property as per

the statutory provisions contained in section 10(1)(a) of the Kandyan

Law Declaration and Amendment Act. He further contended that, since

the parties are subject to Kandyan law, if the Plaintiff were to succeed to

that share of the Paraveni property of his late father, he must first

prove that he is the legitimate son of Singna by producing his birth

certificate.

Learned Presidents Counsel, having referred to the evidence that

indicate Singna and Amangira were in an associated marriage

relationship with the mother of the Plaintiff Kiribindu, contended that

therefore it was incumbent on the trial Court to properly investigate

into the claim of title that had been laid before the trial Court by the

Plaintiff. In determining the Plaintiffs entitlement to paternal

inheritance, it ought to have inquired into the validity of the Plaintiffs

parents marriage and his legitimacy, by applying the relevant legal

principles. It was submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel that the

Plaintiff is not entitled to inherit any Paraveni property due to his

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

8

illegitimacy and the failure of the trial Court to investigate into that

aspect of the title of the Plaintiff, despite being obligated to do so under

section 25 of the Partition Act, tainted the judgment entered in his

favour. Similarly, the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal, in

holding the said erroneous judgment in affirmation, also had fallen into

error and therefore the Defendants seeks that both these judgments be

set aside.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the contention of

the Defendants on the legitimacy of the Plaintiff was raised for the first

time in the High Court of Civil Appeal and had been made without a

point of contest being raised on that question of fact and in the absence

of any item of evidence in support of such a contention. She further

submitted that the Respondents are now seeking to advance a new

argument, which is based purely on the fact that the Plaintiff is without

a birth certificate. She claimed that owing to this reason, the Plaintiff

was unable to refute the position put to him by the Defendants that he

cannot state clearly who his father was, as his mother Kiribindu, who

admittedly had a polyandrous relationship with the two brothers

Singna and Amangira.

She further contended that the mere absence of a birth certificate

does not necessarily make the Plaintiff an illegitimate child. She also

submitted that the Defendants, by making that submission, have

attempted to confuse the issue by interweaving the question of

legitimacy into the question of paternity, by simply placing reliance on

the inability of the Plaintiff to state as to who his father is, since he

could not produce a birth certificate at the trial. According to learned

Counsel these are two independent and sperate factors altogether.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

In the circumstances, undoubtedly it would be a profitable

exercise, that the applicable principles of Kandyan law on marriage and

inheritance are identified and referred to at the outset of this judgment,

which would then facilitate this Court in discharging the task of

determining the several questions of law and related questions of fact,

after undertaking a careful consideration of the material presented

before the trial Court.

It is a well-documented historical fact that, in the Kandyan

kingdom, there were instances of polyandrous marriage relationships,

generally referred to as associated marriages or joint marriages,

following a customary practice that was prevalent during the 18th and

19th centuries, generally between brothers of one family, who had opted

to co-habit with one wife. The Legislature, by enactment of several

statutory provisions contained in Ordinance Nos. 13 of 1859 and 3 of

1870, made it obligatory on all persons subject to Kandyan law to

register their marriages. Only such registered monogamous marriages

were conferred with legal validation, whilst enacting specific provisions

to prohibit the aforesaid customary practice of contracting polyandrous

and polygamous marriages as practiced by some of the inhabitants of

the Kandyan provinces.

Sections 14 and 15 of the Kandyan Law Declaration and

Amendment Ordinance No. 39 of 1938, defined the terms legitimacy

and illegitimacy of children, depending on the fact whether the

marriages of their parents were registered or not. Only the issues of a

registered and thus valid marriages are considered as legitimate. The

legal impact on the children of such customary marriages, created by

the enactment of these statutory provisions, is that the children who

were born to parents with polyandrous marriages have thus become

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

10

illegitimate children along with the children of any unregistered,

monogamous marriages which in turn had an adverse impact on their

rights on paternal inheritance, in relation to Paraveni property. Paraveni

property had been defined in section 10(1)(a) of the said Ordinance.

That section made immovable property to which a deceased person was

entitled to by succession to any other person who has died intestate as

Paraveni property.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff had quoted from the text of

Sinhala Laws and Customs by H.W. Tambiah, where the learned author

states (at p.125) that the children of such associated marriage were

regarded as the legitimate children of all the associated husbands. This had

been the position under Kandyan law, as practiced in the kingdom,

before the statute law had specifically altered its applicability. At one

point of time, Courts were of the view that the legality of a marriage has

no direct impact on the principles of inheritance of the Kandyan

customary law, as practiced in the Kandyan kingdom, following the

judgment of De Sampayo J, in the case of Raja v. Elisa, reported in

Modeler's Kandyan Law page 510, 1 S.C. Civ. Min, 27.05. 1913., which

stated that "British legislation has, no doubt, provided a uniform and

compulsory form of marriage for the Kandyans, but the principles of

inheritance to be found in the ancient Kandyan law remain unaffected.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff may have relied on the above cited

quotation from the text of Sinhala Laws and Customs (supra), in view

of this judgment.

The extended application of this statement, beyond the context in

which it was stated, was subsequently restricted by a full bench, which

had authoritatively laid down its determination, in the judgment of

Kuma v. Banda (1920) 21 NLR 294. The contention that had been

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

11

advanced before their Lordships was in spite of the Kandyan Marriage

Ordinance, No. 3 of 1870, the mutual rights of inheritance between parents

and children do not depend upon the question whether the union of the parents

was registered as a marriage under that Ordinance, but rather upon the

question whether that union was in accordance with the principles of Kandyan

customary law. In rejecting that contention, Bertram CJ made the

following pronouncement in law, on the questions of validity of a

Kandyan marriage and legitimacy of its issues, in view of the statutory

provisions contained in the said Ordinances:

Ordinance No. 3 of 1870 abrogates the old laws of

marriage and makes registration the sole test of the

validity of marriage and consequently of legitimacy.

There was no necessity to state in express terms that

such registration was to be the sole test of legitimacy.

Illegitimacy is involved in the conception of an invalid

marriage. Even if the Kandyan idea of illegitimacy was

different, we are here dealing with an Ordinance of 1870,

and must give the words used by the legislator the

ordinary meaning that they bear in British legislation.

That the Legislature intended to make legitimacy depend

on registration is indicated by the provisions of sections

24 and 30.

Thus, when the Plaintiff instituted the instant partition action in

1988, the law had already been clearly laid down by the superior Courts

and therefore his right to paternal inheritance over any Paraveni

property of his father, who died without leaving a will, is dependent on

the formers legitimacy, which in turn depended on the validity of the

marriage of his parents.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

12

In the amended plaint it is asserted that upon the death of Singna,

who enjoyed a share of the corpus, his rights were devolved on his

son, the Plaintiff. The Defendants, in their joint amended statement of

claim, have denied this statement. Thus, it was incumbent upon the

Plaintiff to prove what he asserted, in relation to his claim based on

paternal inheritance.

The parties, at the commencement of the trial, have admitted that

the title of the corpus was devolved on Kirihapuwa, upon acquisition of

title through deed No. 11880 of 05.06.1885 from Punchi Naide and Ukku

Naide, who they accept as the original owners. Thereafter from

Kirihapuwa, who died intestate, his sons, Singna and Amangira inherited

title to the corpus on equal shares. They also agreed that the rights of

Amangira had devolved on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants through his heirs.

The Plaintiff had suggested four points of contest while the

Defendants have suggested eight. The trial proceeded on the acceptance

of these twelve points of contest. It is significant to note that there was

no admission by the parties that they are subjected to Kandyan law nor

have they suggested a point of contest on that issue.

The Plaintiff gave evidence on his behalf and the 1st and 2nd

Defendants have given evidence on behalf of the Defendants. The real

contest was between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, since the

devolution of title to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, as averred in the

amended plaint, was not contested by the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff

claimed that he is the only son of Singna and since the 1st Defendant was

given in Deega marriage, she is not entitled to any paternal inheritance.

The position that was taken in the amended statement of claim by

the Defendants, that the share of Singna was sold at an auction and

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

13

had been bought over by D.B. Welgedera and M.D. Banda and the

Plaintiff therefore had no right over the corpus, was neither raised as a

point of contest nor was established by presenting evidence. The

Defendant had not confronted the Plaintiff with it during cross

examination either.

The Plaintiff, in support of his claim that the 1st Defendant was

given in Deega had produced her marriage certificate which confirmed

that fact. When she initially denied her blood relationship to the

Plaintiff, she was confronted with her evidence before Court in case No.

2297/P, in which she had admitted him as her elder brother. The 2nd

Defendant also had admitted that the Plaintiff, being the eldest in the

family, is the elder brother of his mother, the 1st Defendant.

The trial Court, having proceeded to trial on the points of contest

already accepted and, on the evidence, placed before it by the parties,

pronounced its judgment in favour of the Plaintiff by allocating a

divided share of the corpus to him upon acceptance of his pedigree,

and conferred the other divided share of Amangira on the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants, as per the same pedigree.

It is relevant to note here that the Defendants have challenged the

allocation of share to the Plaintiff only on the basis that he is unable

to say whether his father was Singna or Amangira since he had no birth

certificate to produce. The questions whether Singna and Kiribindu have

registered their marriage, whether there is a marriage certificate in

conformation of that marriage or whether the Plaintiff is the legitimate

son of Singna was never raised before the trial Court by the Defendants

by suggesting points of contest or taking up that position at least in

their evidence. Owing to that reason the issue of legitimacy has not

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

14

been presented as a disputed fact in issue or was considered by the trial

Court.

It is only to the High Court of Civil Appeal, that the Defendants

have raised the question of legitimacy of the Plaintiff for the first time as

a ground of appeal in their petition of appeal. Learned Presidents

Counsel had relied on this solitary ground of appeal in his written

submissions that had been tendered to the appellate Court. In that

submission, he contended that the Plaintiff has failed to prove that he is

the legitimate son of Singna.

In view of the contention had been presented by the Defendants

before this Court, it appears that their contention is founded on the

premise that it was incumbent upon the Plaintiff in the instant partition

action, not only to prove that he is a son of Singna but also his legitimate

son, which in turn dependent on the validity of his parents marriage.

Earlier on in this judgment, the validity of this contention was accepted.

It is evident from the proceedings that during his cross

examination, the Plaintiff admitted that he had no birth certificate to

produce in support of his assertion that his father is Singna. When it

was put to the Plaintiff that, without a birth certificate, he is unaware as

to the name of his father, he did not reply. Based on this item of

evidence, it was submitted to this Court that, as Singna and Amangira

were in an associated marital relationship, and such forms of customary

marriages were not caught up with the term married according to law,

as stated in section 14 of the Ordinance No. 39 of 1938. In view of the

illegality of such a polyandrous relationship, clearly the Plaintiff could

not be considered as a legitimate son and therefore he had failed in

establishing that fact.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

15

In the absence of any point of contest raised by the parties before

the trial Court, learned Presidents Counsel contended that it was up to

that Court to apply the law and raise the question whether the Plaintiff

is the legitimate son of Singna, as an additional trial issue. It is his

submission that in view of the evidence, the trial Court should have

dismissed the Plaintiffs action seeking partition.

In view of the submissions of the parties as referred to above, it is

convenient to examine them under the following considerations.

a. whether the Plaintiff had sufficiently discharged his

evidentiary burden under the instant partition action to prove

that he is not only the son of Singna but also his legitimate

son and,

b. whether the trial Court, in view of the material placed upon it,

is obligated to inquire into the legitimacy of the Plaintiff,

under section 25 of the Partition Law, since the legitimacy is a

factor which in turn would determine his rights on paternal

inheritance to Paraveni property under the principles of

Kandyan Law, over the corpus.

In dealing with the first segment of the contention as referred to

above, it is the Defendants position that the Plaintiff had failed to prove

that he is Singnas legitimate son. learned Counsel for the Plaintiff

termed this contention as an attempt to confuse Court since the

Defendants, in their cross examination, have capitalised on the

Plaintiffs inability to prove his relationship to Singna by producing his

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

16

birth certificate. They never raised the issue of his legitimacy on the

premise that there is no proof of a valid marriage.

Thus, this Court first examine the relevant evidence on the point.

Relevant section of the proceedings is reproduced below, which

indicate the line of cross examination adopted by the Defendants.

It is noted that despite the fact the Plaintiffs fathers name was

mentioned in the amended plaint as Singna (isx[d), his name has been

erroneously recorded in the proceedings as Singho (isxf[`).

Before venturing into consider whether the Plaintiff had failed to

discharge the evidentiary burn on him to prove that he is the legitimate

son of Singna, it is relevant to examine the nature and the extent of the

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

17

burden of proof that had been imposed on a plaintiff in a partition

action by reference to judicial precedents.

This Court, in the judgment of Abubuker v. Fernando (1987) 2 Sri

L.R. 225 at p.230 stated that it is his burden to prove that he has rights in

the land which he seeks to partition. The question as to how he should

prove his title is answered in the case of Appuhamy v. Punchihamy

(1914) 17 NLR 271 at 274 with the statement that he must prove his title

from the original owner of the land. He is also expected to establish his

pedigree by legally admissible evidence per Cooray et al v. Wijesuriya

(1958) 62 NLR 158 at 163, and, in addition, must prove the title of those

parties to whom he has given shares Mudiyanse v. Ranaweera (1975) 77

NLR 501 at 505. If he relies on any deeds, in proof of his title, then he

must prove them by adducing proof of due execution per Sabaratnam

et al v. Kandavanam (1956) 60 NLR 35 at 38, and should place clear

proof as to how the executant of a deed was entitled to the share which the deed

purports to convey per Fernando v. Fernando and Others (2006) 2 Sri

L.R. 188 at 192. However, it is not essential for a plaintiff to prove that

common possession is inconvenient (Perera and Others v. Fernando

(1956) 60 NLR 229 at 232).

Thus, it is amply clear that the evidentiary burden on a plaintiff

in a partition action is different from his counterpart, who had

instituted an action under section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, since

the former is bound to prove his own title as well as the title of each of

the defendant, as described in his pedigree. This he is expected to do by

placing legally admissible evidence, in relation to the points of contest

suggested by the parties. His failure to do so, particularly in relation to

establishing his own title, would invariably result in the dismissal of his

action as it had been stated by Layard CJ in Mather v. Tamotharam

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

18

Pillai (1908) 6 NLR 246 at 250 unless he makes out his title, his suit for

partition must be dismissed as it has been repeatedly held by this Court that

the District Judge is not to regard the partition suit as merely to be decided on

issues raised by and between the parties to the suit, and that the plaintiff must

strictly prove his title, and, only when he has done so to the satisfaction of the

Court, has he established his right to maintain such action.

The words used by Layard CJ, the plaintiff must strictly prove his

title, in describing the Plaintiffs duty to establish his title to the

commonly held property and the pedigree through which he seeks to

prove that title had been considered by Gratian J in Karunatatne v

Sirimalie (1951) 53 NLR 444 (at 445), in view of the judgment of

Golagoda v Mohideen (1937) 40 NLR 92, where the said statement was

emphasised, in following terms;

In accordance with this principle, the Court should not

enter a partition decree unless, if I may adopt Fernando J's

phrase in Golagoda's case, it is " perfectly satisfied " that

the rights of possible claimants who are not parties to the

proceedings have not been shut out accidently or by design.

Subject however to this important qualification, the fact

remains that a partition action is a civil proceeding, and I

do not understand the authorities to suggest that, where all

possible claimants to the property are manifestly before the

Court, any higher standard of proof should be called for in

determining the question of title than in any other civil

suit.

In the instant partition action, the Plaintiff relies on the principles

of Kandyan law, in support of his claim to share of the corpus, which

had devolved on him through paternal inheritance, as well as to

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

19

disinherit his sister on the basis she had contracted Deega marriage.

That being his assertion, he also must prove that he is the legitimate son

of Singna as rightly contended by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Defendants.

The preferred method of proving that fact is to present the best

evidence of his parentage, through presentation of his birth certificate.

But he didnt. He told Court that he does not have one. The High Court

of Civil Appeal was of the view that being a partition case makes any

difference because it has been decided that there is no additional burden of proof

in a partition case to prove births, deaths and marriages, the production of

relevant certificates is not mandatory.

Under these circumstances, should the partition action of the

Plaintiff be dismissed upon his mere failure to tender the birth

certificate, in proof of his relationship to his father, through whom he

claims paternal inheritance?

In view of the evidence that had been placed before the trial

Court, I do not think it should. The reasons are as follows.

The Plaintiff, when cross examined on his failure to produce the

birth certificate, stated that he does not have one. He was 74 years old

when he gave evidence in 1998 and therefore may have been born in or

around 1924. It could well be that his birth may or may not have been

registered as his parents were in an associated marital relationship at

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

20

the time of his birth. In the absence of a birth certificate and in the

absence of both his parents to offer direct evidence of his birth, the

Plaintiff had thereupon relied on the evidence of family relationship,

elicited through his sister, the 1st Defendant. She admitted in her

evidence that Signa is her father and the Plaintiff is her elder brother.

The 2nd Defendant too had admitted in his evidence of the family

relationship of the Plaintiff to his mother.

To insist upon production of a birth certificate, in proof of the

parentage of a person in such circumstances, as in the instant action,

seemed an unreasonable proposition, in view of the statutory

concession granted to such a party. Whilst it is always prudent and

advisable to insist on formal proof of a birth, marriage or a death, with

the production of the applicable certification, being the best evidence in

support of a family relationship that had become a relevant fact in issue,

at the same time it is important to note that there are statutory

provisions contained in the Evidence Ordinance, which are meant to

cater for such situations, when a party is unable to produce best

evidence in support of such relationship, by providing with an

alternative method of proof.

In a situation where a party on whom the burden of proof lies to

prove that fact in issue, but has no formal proof available in the form of

best evidence, in support of a family relationship, could therefore rely

on hearsay evidence, in proof of that relationship, subject to fulfilment

of certain pre conditions and thereby, facilitating a Court to form an

opinion as to the existence of such a relationship. It must be stressed

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

21

here that proof of such a family relationship by placing reliance on

statements of others, in the absence of best evidence in proof of such

relationships, could effectively be countered by another party by

producing evidence counter to such a claim and thus diminishing the

reliability and weightage attached to such statements.

Sections 32(5) and (6) of the Evidence Ordinance, in order to

cater for such situations, have recognised certain instances to admit

statements made by others as an exception to hearsay rule, and had

accordingly permitted admission of such statements as legal evidence,

in proof of any relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption, made by a

person who, although not available as a witness, but had special means

of knowledge of that fact and made that statement before the dispute

arose (per Cooray et al v. Wijesuriya(1958) 62 NLR 158 at 160). Section

50 of the said Ordinance, in turn, had allowed a Court to form an

opinion as to the existence of such family relationship of one person to

another, upon yet anothers opinion or conduct.

The rationale behind the enactment of the statutory provisions

that are contained in sub sections (5) and (6) of section 32 of the

Evidence Ordinance has been described by Weerasoorya J in Wijesekera

v. Weliwiligoda (1958) 61 NLR 133 at 137 as follows:

The provision is an exception to the rule against hearsay

and has been enacted primarily to meet a situation where

the matter sought to be established involves remote facts of

family history, which are incapable of direct proof. In the

words of Lord Blackburn in Sturla v. Freccia (1879) 5

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

22

A.C. 623 at 641 that the ground is that they were matters

relating to a long time past, and that it was really necessary

to relax the strict rules of evidence there for the purpose of

doing justice ".

The approach that should be adopted by Courts, in considering

such infirmities in the evidence adduced by a plaintiff of a partition

action in proof of the original owner of the corpus, has been clearly

stated by G.P.S. de Silva J (as he was then) in Perera v. Perera (1986) 2 Sri

LR. 208 at 211. In view of the fact that it would not be reasonable to expect

proof within very high degrees of probability on questions such as those

relating to the original ownership of land his Lordship stated that:

Courts by and large countenance infirmities in this

regard, if infirmities they be, in an approach which is

realistic rather than legalistic, as to do otherwise would be

to put the relief given by partition decrees outside the reach

of very many persons seeking to end their co-ownership.

In instituting the instant action, the Plaintiff clearly averred that

he is entitled to a divided share of the corpus upon paternal

inheritance, being the only male child of Singna. It is correct that the

Plaintiff did not describe himself as the only legitimate son of Singna.

But when he averred in the plaint that he is the only male child of

Singna and claims paternal inheritance, what in fact he expects the

Court is to consider that he is the only legitimate son of Singna.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

23

The question that arises here is, did he prove that fact?

Having referred to the 1st Defendants disqualification to any

inherited rights from their father by stating that she was given in a

Deega marriage, the Plaintiff had clearly relied on Kandyan law

principles of succession to assert his rights on paternal inheritance and

accordingly presented his amended plaint on that premise. Point of

contest No. 2 had been suggested by the Plaintiff to the effect whether

the rights of Singna should devolve only on the Plaintiff indicates that it

had been his position that he is entitled to paternal inheritance being the

only legitimate son of Singna.

In its judgment, the trial Court had answered the point of contest

No. 2 in the affirmative and in favour of the Plaintiff but focused its

attention more on the only dispute presented for its determination,

namely, whether the 1st Defendant is entitled to any share of the corpus,

either on paternal inheritance or by prescription. The Court had

decided against her on paternal inheritance, in view of the fact that she

was given in a Deega marriage as per the Copy of Entry of Marriage in

the Kandyan Marriage Register Book (P3) and her own admission of that

fact, in a previous Court proceeding. The Court also concluded that she

had failed to establish acquisition of prescriptive title.

The evidence presented before the trial Court clearly indicate that

the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant are elder brother and younger sister

respectively and that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are the children of the

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

24

1st Defendant. In the Copy of Entry (P3) one Galadeniyalage Ukkuwa had

been a witness to the marriage of the 1st Defendant and the name

appearing in the plaint as the Plaintiff too is Galadeniyalage Ukkuwa. The

Plaintiff is the eldest child among six siblings, while the 1st Defendant

was the 2nd child. It was elicited from the birth certificate of the 1st

Defendant (1V1) that her father is Galadeniyage Singna. None of the

Defendants ever challenged the status of the Plaintiff, who instituted

the instant partition action claiming paternal inheritance, by

confronting him with the allegation that he had instituted the instant

action by falsely claiming to be a son of Singna and therefore is a total

stranger to their family. Nor did they suggest that he is a son of

Amangira. On the contrary, the 1st and 2nd Defendants have admitted

that the Plaintiff is the eldest child in the 1st Defendants family, headed

by her father Singna.

The 1st Defendant, when referring to the Plaintiff as her elder

brother, was probably relying on what she was told of her relationship

to the Plaintiff by her late parents, as she was born after the Plaintiff.

Owing to that reason, she could not have known as to who his parents

are, on her own. Obviously, their parents, in introducing the Plaintiffs

relationship to the 1st Defendant, had relied on their own direct

knowledge of that relationship. Thus, her admission that the Plaintiff is

the eldest in her family is qualified to be admitted as legal evidence and

to have acted upon under section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance. In

view of these evidence, I am of the considered view that the fact the

Plaintiff is Singnas son had been clearly established, even in the absence

of a birth certificate in support of that fact.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

25

Producing a birth certificate at the trial by the Plaintiff would not

have significantly contributed to resolve the issue of legitimacy, as

contended by the Defendants, since legitimacy is dependent on the

validity of the marriage of their parents. The validity of a marriage

between persons subject to Kandyan law had to be decided upon

application of relevant legal principles in Kandyan law, in the absence of

a marriage certificate. The refence to the status of the parents reflected

as married as indicated in the birth certificate, is not conferred with the

status of prima facie evidence of the validity of such marriage, as per

section 57 of Births and Deaths Registration Act, as amended.

Hence, the remaining part of his assertion, whether the evidence

did point to the fact that he is the legitimate son of Singna needed to be

considered.

Learned Presidents Counsels contention, that there was no proof

of a valid marriage and therefore the Plaintiff is an illegitimate child, is

entitled to succeed only if the evidence available as to the nature of the

marriage relationship of the Plaintiffs parents points only to an

associated marriage, which they may have commenced sometime

before 1924, the year the Plaintiff was born. Clearly by then such form

of customary marriages could not have been registered and thus have

become illegal, rendering any offspring of such unions, illegitimate.

But that is not the only evidence before Court. It transpired from

the evidence that Singna and Amangira were initially in an associated

marriage relationship with the mother of the Plaintiff. In addition, it

also transpired from evidence that the said polyandrous relationship

did not persist for long and Singna and Kiribindu have thereafter

married, a fact even the 1st Defendant had accepted.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

26

The Plaintiff, having admitted that there was an associated

marriage relationship of his parents with Amangira, however had

thereafter stated in his evidence that his father Singna had married

(lido nekaod) his mother Kiribindu. The term lido nekaod is generally

used in vernacular to denote a formal marriage and the terms

oslalidfo or lidfo lgq .Ejd indicate its formal dissolution. The 1st

and 2nd Defendants also have testified that the associated marriage

relationship of Singna, Amangira and Kiribindu were disrupted at a

subsequent stage as the two brothers have parted their ways after a

shooting incident. This has happened when the 1st Defendant was a

young child. In conformation of that fact, the 1st and 2nd Defendants

state that the rights of Amangira were devolved on the three children

whom he had considered to have fathered, while the Plaintiff, the 1st

Defendant and another sister (who did not wish to claim any share of

the corpus), were left to claim inheritance under Singna. The associated

marriage would not have survived for that long. What is important is

that both Plaintiff and 1st Defendant have clearly stated in their

evidence that their parents, namely Singna and Kiribindu, have

thereafter lido nekaod.

The identical words used by the two contesting siblings to

describe the status of the marriage of their parents, lido nekaod, in

itself indicate that they speak of this event with their own knowledge, a

factor in line with their evidence that the associated marriage was

disrupted after the youngest of the six children was born. Therefore,

the subsequent marriage of Singna and Kiribindu must have taken

place, when they were old enough to understand its significance. Their

evidence on this matter does not create an impression that they learnt of

the said marriage from others who had come to know from their

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

27

parents. This evidence also indicates that once the customary marriage

was effectively terminated at a subsequent point of time, Singna and

Kiribindu have thereafter married to form a monogamous relationship

and treated the Plaintiff as well as the 1st Defendant and her sister, as

children fathered by Singna.

However, neither party produced any certificate of marriage,

which would have been the best evidence of such a marriage. The

evidence that Singna and Kiribindu were married at a later point of time

however, remains as a fact not assailed by any of the Defendants. The

acceptance of that fact also explains as to why the Defendants did not

raise an issue on legitimacy of the Plaintiff during the trial. It must have

been an accepted fact among the family members. Instead, the

Defendants only utilized the evidence of the associated marriage only to

highlight that the Plaintiff, in the absence of a birth certificate, is unable

to say who his father is, only after the trial Court had rejected the 1st

Defendants claim of prescription. However, the subsequent marriage

of Singna and Kiribindu had altered the status of the Plaintiff, the 1st

Defendant and the other sister as legitimate children of apparently a

valid marriage.

In delivering the judgment of the Court, in Ukku v.

Kirihonda (1902) 6 NLR 104 at 107 (decided after Ordinance No.3 of

1870), Moncrieff CJ stated:

I am inclined to think that subsequent

registration does date back to the original beginning

of the connection between the parties, although it is

quite true that the provisions of section 30 for

rendering legitimate children procreated before

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

28

registration might suggest that the intention of the

Legislature was different. I therefore think there was

in this case, and was intended to be by registration

under section 31 of the Ordinance, a validation of

what had been before a void marriage-a validation

dating from the time the void marriage was entered

into, and a validation also of the legitimacy of the

children.

Legislative provisions reflecting this reasoning are found in the

proviso to section 14 of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment

Ordinance and section 7 of the Marriage and Divorce (Kandyan) Act

No. 44 of 1952 as amended.

Withers J in the judgment of Ahugoda Ukku Etana et al v.

Dombegoda Punchirala et al (1897) 3 NLR 10 at 11, had applied the

presumption of legitimacy to fill in a situation, where insufficient

details of a Kandyan marriage that had said to have taken place prior to

Ordinance No. 3 of 1870 was available before that Court. In Maniapillai

v Sivasamy (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 214, Sosa J refers to the presumption of

legitimacy that had arisen upon the evidence presented under section

32(5) and 50 of the Evidence Ordinance, by a statement contained in a

deed that had been relied upon by a party in a Rei Vindicatio action, had

effectively been rebutted by the opposing party by production of a

marriage certificate containing a clear contrary position.

In this instance too, with the unqualified admission of the

subsequent monogamous marriage of Singna and Kiribindu by the

contesting parties, the presumption of legitimacy arises in favour of the

three children said to have been fathered by Singna, including the

Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

29

These factors made the legitimacy issue settles in favour of the

Plaintiff as even if at the time of his birth, his parents were not married

according to law, by subsequent registration of their union, as

indicative from the term lido nekaod, made him a legitimate child of

those parents.

Thus, in the instant partition action, the decision of the trial

Court, to hold with the Plaintiff on the basis that he had established that

he is the son of Singna and also the fact that Singna had later married

his mother, is well justified, in view of the evidence available before it

and especially in the absence of any evidence in support of a contrary

view. The parentage of the Plaintiff is sufficiently established by him in

proof of his entitlement to a share, by eliciting the evidence of the

subsequent marriage of his parents, through the 1st Defendant, which

in turn had established his legitimacy. Since the claim of marriage of his

parents is admitted by the Defendants in their evidence, the trial Court

is well justified in accepting his right to paternal inheritance to the

share of the Paraveni property, on the basis that he is the only legitimate

son of Singna. The High Court of Civil Appeal too was of the view that

the Plaintiff did establish that fact when it stated in the judgment that

the 1st Defendant as well as the Respondent being in agreement that

Singna was married to Kiribindu and not Amangira makes it possible for the

Court to find that both 1st Defendant and Respondent are natural heirs of

Singna who was validly married to Kiribindu.

In view of the above reasoning, it is clear that the High Court of

Civil Appeal had correctly decided the solitary ground of appeal that

had been presented before it by the Defendants, in challenging the

entitlement of the Plaintiff, on the available evidence and in latters

favour.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

30

The other contention presented before this Court by the

Defendants, in addition to what had already been raised before the

High Court of Civil Appel, is that the trial Court had fallen into error in

its failure to frame an additional point of contest on the question of the

paternity and legitimacy of the Plaintiff and thereby failed to fulfil the

statutory duty to investigate the validity of the title, as imposed by

section 25 of the Partition law. The question, whether the trial Court

should have raised an additional point of contest under these

circumstances, in the absence of such a point of contest suggested by a

party, needed to be answered, in the light of the applicable principles of

law as well as the relevant judicial precedents relating to the statutory

duty imposed on an original Court under section 25 and the instances in

which a trial Court could act under section 149 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

In this context, it is helpful to refer to the statutory provisions

contained in section 25(1) of the Partition law at this point.

Section 25(1) of the Partition law reads thus:

On the date fixed for the trial of a partition action or on

any other date to which the trial may be postponed or

adjourned, the Court shall examine the title of each party

and shall hear and receive evidence in support thereof

and shall try and determine all questions of law and fact

arising in that action in regard to the right, share, or

interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which the

action relates, and shall consider and decide which of the

orders mentioned in section 26 should be made.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

31

This Court, in the judgment of Sopinona v. Pitipanaaracchi &

Others (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 87, had reiterated the collective reasoning of a

long line of judicial precedents, which have described the scope of the

duty that had been imposed on a trial Court under section 25, with the

statement that in a partition action, it would be the prime duty of the

Trial Judge to carefully examine and investigate the actual rights and titles to

the land, sought to be partitioned. In that process it would be essential for the

Trial Judge to consider the evidence led on points of contest and answer all of

them, stating as to why they are accepted or rejected.

The statement of Court that it would be essential for the Trial

Judge to consider the evidence led on points of contest and answer all of them,

refers to an important aspect of the duty of a trial Court under section

25. Section 25 made it obligatory for the trial Court shall hear and receive

evidence, in support of the title of each party and shall also try and

determine all questions of law and fact arising in that action in regard to

the right, share and interest of each party. This Court had therefore

expressed its view that a trial Court must investigate the title of each

party, not by undertaking an investigation on its own terms, but on the

evidence led on points of contest. This aspect highlights the requirement

that it incumbent upon the respective parties to suggest their points of

contest, along the lines on which they are at variance with the facts and

law, relating to the respective positions taken up by each party. Once

the points of contest are settled and accepted by the Court, to place

evidence in support as well as in its opposition, in support of their

respective individual rights, shares and interests. In Juliana Hamine v.

Don Thomas 59 NLR 546, it had been stated that (at p. 549) it is indeed

essential for parties to a partition action to state to the Court the points of

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

32

contest interne and to obtain a determination on them. But the Court also

added that however the obligations of the Court are not discharged unless

the provisions of section 25 of the Act are complied with quite independently of

what parties may or may not do.

Hence arises the question, whether the trial Court should, in this

particular instance, have framed a point of contest on the question of

legitimacy on its own, in the absence of a point of contest to that effect,

in its investigation of title of the Plaintiff.

It is accepted by the full bench decision of Peiris v. Perera (1906)

10 NLR 41 at 43 that the framing of issues is a judicial decision and

such issue need not necessarily be arising out of pleadings, per Bertram

CJ in Silva v. Obeyesekera (1923) 24 NLR 97 at 107. It is also accepted

that the parties could frame additional issues before the pronouncement

of the judgment, as stated in Mohammed v. Lebbe & Others (1996) 2 Sri

L.R. 62 at 65. Why it is important to have all the relevant issues before

the Court during a trial is best explained by a quotation from a

judgment of the High Court of Gujarat, inserted by Prasanna Jayawardena

J, in an unreported judgment of this Court (Seylan Bank Ltd v.

Epasinghe and two Others S.C. Appeal No. SC CHC 39/2006 S.C.

minutes of 01.08.2017). His Lordship had, cited the following statement

of an Indian Judge with approval, in dealing with the scope of framing

of issues in a trial Court:

... issues are backbone of a suit. They are also the lamp-

post which enlightens the parties to the proceedings, the

trial Court and even the appellate Court as to what is

the controversy, what is evidence and where lies the way

to truth and justice.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

33

Thus, it is seen that the parties have an important role in framing

the issues on the relevant contest points, by assisting a trial Court, in

identifying and suggesting the points at which the parties are at

variance and contest and thereby enabling the Court to rightly

determine the dispute presented before it. This assumes a greater

significance in partition actions as the trial Courts shall examine the title

of each party.

Section 19(1)(a) of the Partition Law requires any defendant to file

a statement of claim along with a pedigree showing the devolution of

title, if he disputes any averment in the plaint relating to the devolution of

tile. The Defendants, in their statement of claim, have collectively

sought the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action. They would have easily

achieved their desired objective, if the legitimacy of the Plaintiff was

taken up when they filed their statement of claim. This was the

opportunity for the 1st Defendant to present an alternative pedigree by

disqualifying the Plaintiff on the basis of his illegitimacy. But due to a

reason best known to the Defendants, they did not. Even the 1st

Defendant, who should have had sufficient knowledge of such a

disqualification on the part of the Plaintiff to claim title on paternal

inheritance, did not aver that important factual position in her

statement of claim. Even at the late stage of the trial she could have

either amended her statement of claim in line with that challenge or at

least could have suggested a point of contest on that basis, when she

elicited from the Plaintiff that he had no birth certificate to prove who

his father is and their parents were living in an associated marital

relationship with Amangira.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

34

It is clear that the Defendants have mounted their challenge on

the Plaintiffs assertion that he is the son of Singna only on the basis of

the absence of a birth certificate and that his parents were in an

associated marriage. Therefore, the Defendants contend that the trial

Court should have acted on that evidence in fulfilling its duty to

investigate title of the Plaintiff and thereupon should have applied the

relevant legal principle by framing an additional issue as to the

legitimacy, in determining the Plaintiffs entitlement. The Defendants

added that since the trial Court had failed in that task, and the resultant

error in the judgment made it untenable.

In relation to the question, whether the Plaintiff did establish that

he is the legitimate son of Singna, I have already dealt with the evidence

that were placed before the trial Court and the justifiability of the

conclusion reached by the Courts below on that issue. The evidence

highlighted by the Defendants points out that Singna was in an

associated marriage relationship which may have made the Plaintiff an

illegitimate child, but the evidence also points to the subsequent

monogamous marriage of Singna with the mother of the Plaintiff, which

had erased that disqualification with the operation of law. If the

evidence presented before the trial Court prima facie points to the fact

that the Plaintiff is the legitimate son of Singna, in the absence of any

challenge and any evidence pointing to a contrary position, the Court is

justified in acting on that evidence. Dealing with the burden of proof in

civil cases, Coomaraswamy in his text of The Law of Evidence, states

(Vol. II Book I at p. 293) that Generally the initial burden to prove a prima

facie case is on the plaintiff. The Defendant adduces rebutting evidence. After

the entire evidence is led, if the tribunal is not in a position to decide which

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

35

version is true, the tribunal must hold that party on whom the burden lay did

not discharge it. Otherwise, the burden recedes into the background.

In these circumstances, I am not inclined to agree with the

contention advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel that the trial

Court should have raised an additional issue on its own under section

149, in relation to the legitimacy of the Plaintiff, in the absence of any

evidence, warranting such an investigation. In fact, it is observed that

the trial Court had raised an additional issue, though not in explicit

terms, based on the available evidence and made a determination on it,

when it decided that the parties are governed by Kandyan law.

The Court had taken that step when none of the parties did

suggest such a point of contest nor made an admission as to the

applicability of a personal law. Nonetheless, the trial Court had

correctly decided that the parties are governed by Kandyan law and

accordingly determined the rights of the parties by applying those

principles of law. That course of action is amply justified as the Plaintiff,

as averred in his amended plaint, had presented both oral and

documentary evidence in support of the point of contest whether he

alone is entitled to paternal inheritance, and the evidence so presented

has clearly revealed that the 1st Defendant had contracted a Deega

marriage and therefore is not entitled to any rights based on paternal

inheritance of Paraveni property.

The trial Court, at that instance, had acted in line with the

principle laid down in the full bench decision of Attorney General v.

Punchirala (1919) 21 NLR 51 at 58 where De Sampayo J stated that no

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

36

Court should refuse to apply statute law, even though there be no formal issue

stated on the point. If necessary, the Court should, in pursuance of the

provision of the Civil Procedure Code in that behalf, frame an issue before

delivering judgment.

In relation to question of the Plaintiffs legitimacy, there was no

evidence which tend to touch upon the legal invalidity of the

monogamous marriage of Singna and Kiribindu and that particular fact

of their marriage therefore remains as an accepted and uncontested

fact between the Plaintiff as well as the 1st Defendant. There was no

further probe by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, when the Plaintiff and the

1st Defendant claim their parents have lido nekaod and left the

question of their marriage on that. This aspect had already been

considered earlier on in this judgment in detail.

Even if the trial Court were to raise an additional point of contest

on the question of legitimacy, without any evidence, the Defendants did

not offer an explanation in their submissions as to why the trial Court

should limit that question of legitimacy only to the Plaintiff. The

evidence is clear that both Singna and Amangira were in an associated

marriage with Kiribindu. If Plaintiff is an illegitimate son of Singna

because of that invalid marriage, so are the descendants of Amangira

namely Juwanis/Jeewa and Menika, through whom the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants have derived their title to a share of the corpus,

respectively. If that is the case, then they too are not entitled to any

rights devolved on paternal inheritance over Paraveni property on their

predecessors in title. The trial Court is duty bound to investigate the

right, title or interest claimed by all the parties before it and the

Defendants are not exempted from that investigation simply because

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

37

there was no contest by the Plaintiff in his pedigree as to their rights.

The Defendants, without disputing that fact, cannot seek to impose an

additional burden on the Plaintiff of proving that he is not disqualified

to bring in the instant action for want of a valid title, in seeking to

partition a commonly held immovable property.

The issue of legitimacy of the Plaintiff was introduced for the first

time only at the appeal stage when it was taken up by the Defendants

before the High Court of Civil Appeal by placing reliance upon a

section of evidence relating to an associated marriage that had existed

at some point of time while conveniently ignoring the rest, and thereby

effectively denying the Plaintiff of any opportunity to put across his

version, in countering that allegation. Strangely, there was no objection

raised by the Plaintiff for raising this question of law mixed with facts at

that stage.

Returning to the question whether a trial Court on its own should

frame additional issues, it is accepted that section 149 of the Civil

Procedure Code does provide for such a course of action to a trial

Court. Section 149 reads that a Court may, at any time before passing a

decree, amend the issue or frame additional issues on such terms as it thinks

fit. However, in the judgment of Seylan Bank Ltd v. Epasinghe and

two Others (supra), this Court considered the legality of a trial Court,

framing issues on its own before the judgment, but without affording

an opportunity to the parties to present additional evidence and to

address Court. Prasanna Jayawadena J had quoted from the judgment of

Hameed v. Cassim (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 30 where Dr. Ranaraja J, defined the

scope of section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code, in the light of the

judgment of Silva v. Obeysekara (supra) as follows:

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

38

The provisions of section 149 considered along with the

observation of Bertram C.J. certainly do not preclude a

District Judge from framing a new issue after the parties

have closed their respective cases and before the judgment

is read out in open court. It is not necessary that the new

issue should arise on the pleadings. A new issue could be

framed on the evidence led by the parties orally or in the

form of documents. The only restriction is that the Judge

in framing a new issue should act in the interests of

justice, which is primarily to ensure the correct decision

is given in the case. It also means that the Judge must

ensure that when it is considered necessary to hear parties

to arrive at the right decision on the new issue, that they

be permitted to lead fresh evidence or if it is purely a

question of law, that they be afforded an opportunity to

make submissions thereon. (emphasis added)

His Lordship was of the view that while a trial judge does have

the jurisdiction to frame additional issues at the stage of the judgment, that is a

discretion which would, usually, be exercised sparingly and only in the

circumstances where it is necessary to do so to ensure that justice is done and

the correct decision is reached by the Court. If the issue of legitimacy of the

Plaintiff was not raised by the Defendants as a relevant fact in issue

with which they are at variance and the pleadings does not require

framing of such an issue by the Court at the commencement of the trial,

then there must be legally admissible evidence that had sprung up

during the trial, upon which a trial Court could justifiably act under

section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code, either to amend an already

settled issue or to frame an additional one based on that evidence.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

39

It is obvious that the issue of legitimacy of a party in a partition

action is not a pure question of law but a mixed question of law and

fact. This is because the validity of the contention of the Defendants is

depend on the body evidence presented before the trial Court,

concerning the parentage of the Plaintiff, the validity of the marriage of

his parents and also of his legitimacy, upon the application of the

principles of Kandyan law on that evidence. But the body of evidence

that had been presented before the trial Court does not warrant it to act

under section 149 and to frame an additional point of contest in relation

to the legitimacy of the Plaintiff, in the presence of the evidence already

referred to and absence of any other evidence pointing to a contrary

view. I derive support in forming that view as it has been stated in

Nagubai Ammal v. Shama Rao (1956) AIR SC 593 at p.598 ( a judgment

quoted in Seylan Bank Ltd v. Epasinghe and two Others) that the true

scope of the rule is that evidence let in on issues on which the parties actually

went to trial should not be made the foundation for decision of another and

different issue, which was not present to the minds of the parties and on which

they had no opportunity of adducing evidence .

In view of the contention of the Defendants that it was the

responsibility of the trial Court to have investigated into the legitimacy

of the Plaintiff in fulfilling its statutory duty under section 25 of the

Partition Law, and the reasoning contained in the preceding

paragraphs, I am of the view that the following observations of

Anandacoomaraswamy J, made in the judgment of Thilagaratnam v.

Athpunadan & Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 66 are equally relevant to the

instant appeal as well.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

We are not unmindful of these authorities and the

proposition that it is the duty of the Court to investigate

title in a partition action, but the Court can do so only

within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of

contest, evidence both documentary and oral. Court

cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and

finding the shares in the corpus for them, otherwise

parties will tender their pleadings and expect the Court to

do their work

Having reached the last segment of this judgment, it is also

relevant to examine the proceedings, in order to satisfy whether the

parties have acted in collusion before the trial Court to supress the

disqualification of the Plaintiff as highlighted by the Defendants only in

their appeal.

If the Plaintiff, being an illegitimate child, born out of an

unregistered union of persons subjected to Kandyan law, in fact has had

that disqualification to inherit Paraveni property, it is reasonable to

expect the 1st Defendant to seek dismissal of the partition action

instituted by the former on that very basis. As already noted, she

should have personal knowledge of such a disqualification which could

have been utilized to challenge the Plaintiffs status in instituting the

instant action. The 1st Defendant in her evidence had initially denied

any blood relationship with the Plaintiff and also denied that she was

given in a Deega marriage. When confronted with her evidence in

another action as to her relationship with the Plaintiff and the

production of an extract of the Register of Kandyan marriages only she

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

41

did admit the relationship. Given the obviously strained relationship

with her brother, as indicated by her conduct before the trial Court, it is

highly improbable for her to conceal such a disqualification on the part

of the Plaintiff, if that really existed.

There was no discernible reason for the 1st Defendant to concede

that her parents have lido nekaod, a factor in favour of the Plaintiff, who

had offered a limited evidentiary support of his claim. But instead of

highlighting the said latent disqualification of her brother to inherit

share of the corpus, the 1st Defendant had acted contrary to her own

position by tacitly admitting the devolution of title as described by the

Plaintiff through paternal inheritance and claimed only acquisition of

prescriptive against the title acquired by him through inheritance. This

is significant, when the Plaintiff, in his amended plaint, had raised a

disqualification to the 1st Defendants claim of paternal inheritance on

the basis that she is not entitled to any rights over the corpus as she had

married in Deega. No point of contest was suggested on the legitimacy

nor did the Defendants make any submissions on that point before the

trial Court.

Clearly the issue of the legitimacy of the Plaintiff was not raised

at the trial, because of a private arrangement that existed between the

contesting parties. This situation is more in line with the proposition

that the Defendants, including the 1st Defendant, have accepted the

Plaintiff as a legitimate son of Singna and have acted on that premise up

to the institution of the instant partition action. Their joint statement of

claim, that had been tendered to Court on instructions to their Attorney,

who would have advised them of the applicable law, is indicative of the

said family belief that the Plaintiff had no such disqualification to begin

with.

S.C. Appeal No. 77/2013

42

In view of the above, I answer all three questions of law, on

which leave was granted, in the negative and against the Defendants.

Accordingly, the judgments of the High Court of Civil Appeal as well

as the District Court of Kurunegala are affirmed.

Accordingly, the appeal of the Defendants is dismissed with costs

both here and in the High Court of Civil Appeal.
