The Facts

This is an appeal filed by the 1st Defendant- Appellant-Appellant (namely one

Rasa Vijendranathan, hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) against the Judgement

delivered in the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 20th December 2012.

This action is regarding the Puliyady Pillaiyar Temple and its temporalities

situated at Mill Road, Soosaipillaiyarkulam Road Junction. The Plaintiffs- Respondents-

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Plaintiffs-

Respondents) state that they are worshippers and members of the congregation of

the said temple and have been in the habit of attending the performance of the

worship and or services held at the said temple. The land on which the said temple is

situated was originally owned by Annapillai Visvalingam by the Deed no.2171 dated

21.03.1927, attested by P.K. Pedurupillai Notary Public of Mullativu District. The second

to the fifth Defendants are the descendants of the said Annapillai Visvalingam. A

granite statue of Pillaiyar was installed in this land and worshipped by persons of Hindu

religion and the temple was built with the consent of Muthurajah Jeyaratnam

descendant of Annapillai Visvalingam in the said land by the worshippers as shrine.

In or about 1996, the people of Vavuniya were displaced due to the civil war

and the temple was abandoned. After the people returned to their respective homes

the worshippers including the Plaintiffs-Respondents started repairing the said temple

at their expenses with the consent of late Muthurajah Jeyaratnam the descendant of

Annapillai Visvalingam, the father of the 2nd-8th Defendant - Respondents-

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the 2nd-8th Defendants-

Respondents) and poojas and services were held at the Temple.

The Plaintiff-Respondents state that the Appellant unlawfully ousted the

worshippers and the 2nd-8th Defendants-Respondents and their father, late Muthurajah

Jeyaratnam, from the management control and administration of the temple and their

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 28

powers and took control of the said temple and administers the said temple contrary

to the interests of the 2nd 8th Defendants and the worshippers. The Plaintiffs alleged

that the Appellant wrongfully collects money from the worshippers and

misappropriates the collection and the Appellant had never shown any account and

he does not manage the temple properly. The Plaintiffs state there is a general

dissatisfaction among the congregation with the way the Appellant manages the

temple hence the Appellant is not a fit and proper person to be in charge of the

Charitable trust and should be removed from office.

The Plaintiffs-Respondents instituted action at the District Court of Vavuniya

against the Appellant and 2nd to 8th Defendants-Respondents-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendants-Respondents) stating inter-alia that the

Plaintiffs-Respondents are worshippers and members of the congregation of the

Puliyady Pillaiyar Temple and are interested in the said Temple and its temporalities

within the meaning of Section 102 of the Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917 (as amended).

They further stated that the said Temple is a place of Hindu Religious worship and is a

charitable trust within the meaning of Section 102 of the Trusts Ordinance, while also

stating that the Appellant has unlawfully ousted the worshipers and the Defendants-

Respondents, took control of the said Temple.

The Plaintiffs further stated that it had become necessary for the Plaintiffs to apply

for an order declaring that the temple and its temporalities a charitable trust, setting

up a new scheme of management and removing the Appellant from the Board of

trustees.

The Plaintiffs further stated in their Plaint that they have presented a Petition to the

Government Agent through the Divisional Secretary, Vavuniya for the appointment of

a Commissioner to inquire into the subject matter of the Petition under Section 102 of

the Trusts Ordinance and that the Commissioner has issued a letter to the effect that

an inquiry has been held regarding the matters mentioned in the Petition filed, that it

was not possible to reach an amicable settlement due to the objections of the

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 28

Respondents. The letter advises the parties to refer the matter to court if they wish to

take further action regarding the same.

The Appellant purports that the above matters pertaining to the response by the

Divisional Secretary to be incorrect and misleading and alleges that the purported

letter issued by the Government Agent dated 06.06.2005, marked P-01 does not on

the face of it conveys any such matters as referred to by the Plaintiffs-Respondents.

The Appellant filed his answer and raised preliminary objections to the effect that

the said action was filed without compliance with the condition precedent to filing of

the action, that no certificate under and in terms of the Trusts Ordinance had been

obtained from the Government Agent, that the letter dated 06/06/2005 was not issued

upon an inquiry held in terms of the requirements of the Trusts Ordinance, more

specifically in compliance with Section 102 of the same, and that therefore the

Respondents do not have locus standi to have and maintain this action.

The Appellant substantiates his interest in the temple and the Land owing to the

fact that his Grandfathers Uncle had consecrated a Pillaiyar Statute under a Tamarind

tree (referred to as Pulia Maram in Tamil) and had worshipped in the 19th Century,

thus leading to the Temple eventually being name Puliyady Pillaiyar (this can be

interpreted to mean Pillaiyar under a Tamarind tree). The Appellant claims that

thereafter his grandfather, subsequently his son and presently himself managed,

maintained, expanded and developed the temple. The Appellant claims that the

Respondents are not worshipers of the temple and have filed this action at the

instigation of the 2nd Defendant- Respondent.

Nevertheless, subsequent to the letter dated 06/06/2005 by the Divisional

Secretary, the Plaintiffs-Respondents filed Plaint dated 10/06/2005 at the District Court

of Vavuniya where the Appellant raised the issues regarding compliance with Section

102 as preliminary objections. The Learned District Court Judge had held the following

by Order date 15/05/2008:

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 28

a) The Action is said to have been filed under and in terms of Section 102 of the

Trusts ordinance. But the Objection taken the 1st Defendant that the said action

has not been instituted under Section 102 of the Trusts Ordinance becomes a

question of law

b) The fact that the document dated 06/06/2005 marked P-01 filed by the Plaintiffs

along with the Plaint has complied with the Trusts Ordinance can only be

decided at the end of the trial in as much as the Plaintiffs Attorney-at-law

replied to the objection raised by the Appellant. Therefore, the said document

can be accepted or not can be decided only after the leading of evidence

c) Similarly, 17,18,19 and 20th Issues are also issues of law and thus they also can

be decided only upon leading evidence.

d) The Court has decided to record the full evidence before deciding the said

issues.

Being aggrieved by the said Order the Appellant filed application for Leave to

Appeal to the High Court of Vavuniya, whereupon the High Court delivered Order

dated 20/12/2012 dismissing the Appeal with costs.

The Appellant has filed Petition dated 31st January 2013 before this Court, and was

granted leave on the following question of law as found in Paragraph 25(b) of the

Petition as follows:

25 b) Have the District Court Judge and the Judges of the High Court erred

in law that there was a valid action when the Plaint has not disclosed the

condition precedent to entertain an action by Court under and in terms of

Section 102(3) of the Trusts Ordinance?

In answering this question of law, I find it pertinent to lay out the facts of the case

followed by an examination of the relevant provisions of law, namely Section 102 of

the Trusts Ordinance.

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 28

Compliance with Section 102(3) of the Trusts Ordinance.

The facts in contention of the instant case are surrounding two specific documents,

namely the Petition filed at the Divisional Secretary and the document marked P-01

which was issued by the Divisional Secretary advising the parties to take this matter to

court.

The Appellant avers that these documents are not in compliance with the

requirements of Section 102(3) of the Trusts Ordinance.

Section 102 (3) states as follows:

(3) No action shall be entertained under this section unless the plaintiffs

shall have previously presented a petition to the *Divisional Secretary

of the Divisional Secretary's Division in which such place or establishment

is situate praying for the appointment of a commissioner or commissioners

to inquire into the subject-matter of the plaint, and unless the *Divisional

Secretary of the Divisional Secretary's Division shall have certified that an

inquiry has been held in pursuance of the said petition, and that the

commissioner or commissioners (or a majority of them) has reported

(a) that the subject-matter of the plaint is one that calls for the

consideration of the court; and

(b) either that it has not proved possible to bring about an amicable

settlement of the questions involved, or that the assistance of the court is

required for the purpose of giving effect to any amicable settlement that

has been arrived at.

(*See section 4 of the Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act, No.

58 of 1992.)

(Emphasis Added)

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 28

The above provision makes it apparent that the Legislators intended for parties

to seek resolution of dispute through amicable means prior to seeking redress at

courts. For this purpose, Section 102 (3) mandates that persons with concerns

pertaining to religious trusts present their concern to the Divisional Secretary

whereupon the Divisional Secretary will adequately inquire into said matter and

communicating the results of such inquiry to the parties. The Divisional Secretary may

find that the parties are amenable to come to an amicable solution or may find that

there is a scheme discussed regarding which the parties may seek the advice of courts

or may certify that such amicable solution is not achievable and thus advise parties to

seek redress at the relevant District Court.

Religious Trusts and disputes arising thereof are extremely sensitive in nature

given the nature of communities and their bonds, individual and ancestral, with the

community in itself and the place of worship. As such, the Trusts Ordinance referred

to a Government Agent as they were meant to be in a position to be inquire into and

be more sensitive to the intricacies of religious and social communities concerned with

the place of worship, more so than the court system. The Divisional Secretary is in a

position to resolve such dispute through inquiry and amicable settlement in order to

ensure minimal displeasure and resentment within such community. This allows minor

disputes to be settled expeditiously without referring to courts.

As such the above mechanism requires, in essence, that prior to calling upon

the advice of the Courts, the concerned parties communicate the raised concerns in a

written form to the Divisional Secretary, the conducting of an inquiry by the Divisional

Secretary, and finally the communication of results of such inquiry via written form by

the Divisional Secretary. The purpose of the Petition and certification by the Divisional

Secretary is in order for these goals to be met. However, the Trusts Ordinance does

not specify a format for either document.

In interpreting the format required of documents under the above provision,

the Appellant states that the learned District Court Judge and High Court Judge have

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 28

failed to apply the stare decisis held in the cases of Sivaguru v Alagaratnam 48 NLR

369, Siththiravelu v Ramalingam and Others 61 CLW 31, Velautham v Velauther

61 NLR 230 and Ramesh and another v Chettiar (2004) 1 SLR 355.

The case of Sivaguru v Alagaratnam (Supra) concerned five persons interested

in a temple, who brought an action under section 102 of the Trusts Ordinance praying

that the defendants, who were the trustees, be held unfit to hold office. The certificate

of the Government Agent was filed with their plaint and the only question in issue was

whether the certificate sufficiently complied with Section 102 (3) (a) and (b) of the

Trusts Ordinance. In this case, the contents of the certificate are said to have stated as

follows:

" I certify that Mr. A. Alagaratnam and others presented a petition on

January 24, 1945, praying for the appointment of a Commission to inquire

into the accounts and the management of the Mamangapillaiyar Temple.

The Commissioners duly appointed by me have reported that an inquiry

has been held into these matters which form the subject-matter of the

plaint and that the assistance of the Court may be obtained to Implement

the scheme adopted by the members of the congregation ".

The Learned Judge Hon. Keuneman A.C.J noted that the above did not amount to a

certificate fulfilling the criteria prerequisite of Section 102 (3) given that,

under section 102 (3), the Government Agent's certificate must contain

the statement " that an inquiry has been held in pursuance of the said

petition and that the Commissioner or Commissioners or a majority of

them has reported (a) that the subject-matter of the plaint is one that calls

for the consideration of the Court and (b) either that it has not proved

possible to bring about an amicable settlement of the questions

involved or that the assistance of the Court is required for the

purpose of giving effect to any amicable settlement which has been

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 18 of 28

arrived at. The document P 1 certainly does not show that Commissioners

have held categorically that " the subject-matter of the plaint is one that

calls for the consideration of the Court". I think it is advisable that all

Commissioners should make specific reference to that fact as required by

section 102 (3) (a). But even if we can assume for the purposes of the

argument that such an allegation is to foe implied in P 1, it is not possible

for us to hold that there has been a compliance with section 102 (3) (b) for

the simple reason that it is impossible for us to say from P 1 whether

there has or has not been an amicable settlement of the questions

involved. There should have been a statement that there either was

or was not an amicable settlement. The words in, P 1 " the assistance

of the Court may be obtained to implement the scheme adopted by the

members of the congregation " do not necessarily convey the idea that

there was an amicable settlement between the plaintiffs in this case and

other parties possibly interested in the temple or with the trustees in the

case we do not know what the scheme adopted was, whether it

related to the subject-matter of the plaint or not and we do not know

who were the members of the congregation ".

(Emphasis Added)

In examining the above, I find that the concern of the learned Judge was a lack of

clarity in the said certificate in regard to the success or failure of reaching an amicable

settlement. As such, the Divisional Secretary is expected to indicate the outcome of

the inquiry, especially given the vague terms referring to a scheme adopted by the

members of the congregation. I believe that the facts of the instant case are not akin

to the facts of the above case as there is no reference to a vague scheme to be adopted

nor is there a lack of clarity in terms of the outcome of the inquiry in the instant case.

Secondly, In the case of Velautham v Velauther 61 NLR 230, The certificate

by the Division Secretary stated as follows:

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 19 of 28

"I do hereby certify under sub-section (3) of Section 102 of the Trusts

Ordinance (Cap. 72) that in pursuance of a petition presented to me by Mr.

S. Velautham and nine others of Analaitivu regarding the management of

the Sangaramoorthy Murugamoorthy Temple, Analaitivu, in the Divisional

Revenue Officer's division of Islands, I appointed . by an act of

appointment dated 3rd January, 1955 commission to enquire into the

subject matter of the said petition and

2. That the enquiry had been held in pursuance of the said petition and

that the said commissioners have reported:

(a) That the subject- matter of the said petition is one that calls for

consideration of the Court;

(b) That it has not been proved possible to bring about an amicable

settlement of the questions involved. "

Whereupon objection was taken up to the effect that there was no plaint presented

along with the petition to the Government Agent. Hon. Basnayake, C. J. agreed with

the District Court and stated that the decision was taken in accordance with the case

of Sivaguru v. Alagaratnam (Supra), In that:

as section 102 (3) declares that no action shall be entertained unless the

Government Agent shall have certified that the commissioners have

reported that the subject matter of the plaint is one that calls for the

consideration of the Court. Clearly the commissioners cannot make such

a report unless the plaint is annexed to the petition presented to the

Government Agent and he cannot certify that they have so reported unless

the commissioners have done so.

Thereafter, in the case of Siththiravelu v Ramalingam and Others 61 CLW 31,

Basnayake C.J states as follows

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 20 of 28

It has been held by this Court in the case of Velautham and others v

Velauther and Another, that the certificate should be in terms of the sub-

section (3) and that to enable the Government Agent to issue the

prescribed certificate the petitioners should submit the plaint they propose

to file in the Court upon receiving the certificate. Unless that is done the

Commissioner cannot report that the subject matter of the plaint is one

that calls for the consideration of the Court and the Government Agent

cannot certify that they have so reported. In the instant case it would

appear that the plaint which was filed was not submitted to the

Government Agent.

Finally in the case of Ramesh and another v Chettiar (2004) 1 SLR 355, the

cases mentioned above have been re-examined by the Court of Appeal.

However, in terms of the interpretations afforded by the above cases, I am

inclined to only agree with the case of Sivaguru v Alagaratnam as the purpose was

in regard to the clarity of the certificate. The Court in that instance decided that the

certificate did not conform to Section 102 since there was an ambiguity pertaining to

the Scheme adopted by the members of the congregation and did not refer to a

requirement of a plaint being submitted to the Government Agent.

In the instant case, the letter by the Government Agent of Vavuniya is

My No: GA/ADM/CO/T Your No: Date: 06.06.2005

Mr.S.Shanmugarathnam,

171, Kanthasamy Kovil Road,

Vavuniya.

Dear Sir,

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 22 of 28

Dispute regarding the Siththivinayagar Temple, Puliyady, Vavuniya

This is with regarding to the letter signed by you and by several others and sent to

me on 26.05.2005 regarding the above matter.

I inform you that even though measures were taken and meetings held by the

Divisional Secretary of Vavuniya on my instruction to settle amicably the above

dispute regarding the temple according to the complaint signed by you and by

several others on July 2003 (without dated) and sent to me and the Divisional

Secretary of Vavuniya, the dispute couldnt be settled amicably due to the protests

of the Defendants.

Therefore, if you wish to take further action regarding this, I recommended you to

refer this matter to the court and the dispute could be settled.

In your service,

Sgd illegibly

(S.Shanmugam)

Government Agent

Vavuniya District

CC: Divisional Secretary, Vavuniya:- for information

The above is signed by one S. Shanmugan, Government Agent of Vavuniya District and

copied to the Divisional Secretary of Vavuniya.

As such, the above clearly indicated that this letter has been written in reference

to the dispute directed to the Divisional Secretary by the parties, that an inquiry has

been conducted regarding the same, that the dispute cannot be settled amicable, and

recommends that the parties refer this dispute to the court if they wish to take further

action. Given that no set template or requirements beyond those enumerated within

the provision itself dictates the format of the certification by the Government Agent, I

find this letter to be sufficient for the purposes of Section 102(3).

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 23 of 28

In applying the requirements of Section 102(3) of the Trusts Ordinance to the

instant case, I find that as required, the Plaintiffs have previously presented a Petition

to the Government Agent, this document is in the required form as it does not leave

any ambiguity to the effect that it is a Petition by stating The Petition of the Petitioners

abovementioned appearing by their Attorney-at-Law and thereafter clearly stating

the claims. As such I find no discrepancies in the document found in page 270 of the

brief for the purposes of Section 102(3).

Section 102(3) requires that the Commissioner appointed inquire into the

subject matter of the plaint as opposed to a plaint in itself. The plaint stands as a

document to be submitted and assessed before the court and not before the

Government Agent. The subject matter of the Plaint is extremely similar to the Petition

in the instant case. Paragraph 15 of the Petition and the Prayer in the Plaint both pray

for the declaration of the said temple and its temporalities as a charitable trust,

settlement of a scheme of management for the proper administration of the said

temple and its temporalities, removing the Appellant from the Management of the

temple, appointment of a Board of Trustees and ordering of any other costs and reliefs

the court may deem suitable. Therefore, by reference to the Petition submitted by the

Plaintiffs, the Divisional Secretary has inquired into the prayers of the same and thus

adequately addressed the subject matter of the plaint prior to arriving at the

conclusion that the solution. This is sufficient as Section 102 (3) does not require the

Plaint itself to be forwarded but that the subject matter of the plaint be inquired. As

such, the reference of plaintiff and plaint is not for the Purpose of the Divisional

Secretary but the District Court in the context of this provision.

Stare Decisis in Sri Lanka

Keeping the above facts and interpretation in mind I find that the cases

subsequent to Sivaguru v. Alagaratnam are not correct according to the law as a

requirement of submitting the plaint, which is to be submitted before the court, to the

Government Agent is not found within Section 102(3) itself and has been read into the

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 24 of 28

same through the cases as enumerated above. I find that in order for the Plaintiffs to

be in compliance with Section 102(3), it is sufficient for the Petition and the certification

to fulfil certain criteria in its content as no strict prescribed format has been provided

by the Trusts Ordinance for the same. As such, I find that the interpretations in the

cases Siththiravelu v Ramalingam and Others 61 CLW 31, Velautham v Velauther

61 NLR 230 and Ramesh and another v Chettiar (2004) 1 SLR 355 are based upon

a misconception of the relevant provisions. As these judgements have been followed

by the Court of Appeal in the case of Ramesh and another v Chettiar (2004) 1 SLR

355. The views in this decision are not correct according to law and are not accepted

by the Supreme Court based on the aforementioned reasoning.

At this juncture I find it pertinent to discuss the concept of Stare Decisis as

followed in Sri Lanka in order to ascertain whether the abovementioned dicta have any

binding force upon the present Court. In order to do so, one must identify the

particulars of the above cases. The case of Sivaguru v. Alagaratnam was decided by

the Supreme Court in the year 1947 by Hon. Keuneman, A.C.J. and Hon. Jayetileke, J.

The case Velautham v Velauther was decided by the Supreme Court in the year 1957

by Hon. Basnayake, C.J., and Hon. Sinnetamby, J. The case Siththiravelu v

Ramalingam and Others was decided by the Supreme Court in the year 1961 by Hon.

Basnayake, C.J. and Hon. H. N. G Fernando, J. Finally, the case of Ramesh and another

v Chettiar was decided by the Court of Appeal in the year 2004 by Hon. Amaratunga,

J. and Hon. Wimalachandra, J.

As has long been accepted and as was discussed by Hon. Basnayake C.J himself

in Bandahamy v. Senanayake 62 NLR 313, the principle or doctrine of stare decisis

has been received and adopted in this country, with modifications, during the colonial

period. As stated in this decision:

The decision of an ultimate or appellate court has a dual aspect. The

decision of the dispute between the parties and the principles of law which

the court lays down in deciding that dispute. The actual decision of the

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 25 of 28

dispute binds the parties. About that there is no question. The principles of

law guide the court in deciding similar disputes and most courts of appeal

and of ultimate jurisdiction regard themselves as bound by the principles

enunciated by them in their decisions. The first aspect concerns the parties,

the second the public, the profession and the subordinate courts and

tribunals bound or influenced by those decisions.

It was further recognized that the doctrine limited this precedent to the ratio decidendi

of a case and does not include the obiter dicta as found in a judgement. It was

recognized that:

The principle of Iaw which guides a court of ultimate or appellate

Jurisdiction in arriving at its decision in the case before it, is for

convenience called the ratio decidendi of the case (the reason of or for

decision). The expression may be taken as meaning " the reason for the

order that the court makes" or " the reason or ground on which a judgment

is rested" .

In the above cases of Siththiravelu v Ramalingam and Others and Ramesh

and another v Chettiar, the ratio decidendi of Velautham v Velauther was followed

in arriving at both decisions, as was apt at the time, while the latter case interpreted

the ratio decidendi in the case of Sivaguru v. Alagaratnam.

However, it must be noted that the Sri Lankan Courts have recognized the

necessity and value of a flexible approach to the doctrine of Stare Decisis as in the case

of Unique Gemstones LTD. v. W. Karunadasa and Others (1995) 2 SLR 357, which

quoted Bandahamy v. Senanayake to the effect that:

The very strength of judgment law lies in his flexibility and capability of

development by judicial exposition by generation of Judges. A Rigid

Adherence to 'Stare Decisis' would rob our system of its virtues and hamper

its development. We should strive to strike a mean between the one

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 26 of 28

extreme of too frequent changes in the law without sound and compelling

reasons for them and the other extreme of slavish adherence to precedent

merely because it has been decided before.

In deciding the binding effect of the ratio decidendi in the above cases, I find it

pertinent to establish three key elements.

Firstly, it is pertinent to examine the established law regarding the binding effect

of judgements based on the number of judges constituting a bench. In the case of

Bandahamy v. Senanayake, the binding effect of decisions based on the number of

number of judges constituting the bench was rather extensively discussed along with

the cursus curiae established by Basnayake C.J. with importance to the instant scenario,

the cursus curiae as outline stated that a bench of two judges sitting together regard

themselves bound by a decision of three or more judges. The same is accepted by

English courts as mentioned by Lord Goddard in Edwards v. Jones [1947] 1 All E. R.

830, 833 by stating that;

"I should have no hesitation, if necessary, in differing from the decision in

that case, not merely because we are sitting now as a court of three, and

that was a court of two, but also because the case was not argued for the

defendants, who did not appear, and when a case has been argued only

on one side, it has not the authority of a case which has been fully argued".

In the above benches, as enumerated above, all judgements have been

delivered by a bench constituting of only two Judges. As such, the decisions in the

above referred cases do not have absolute binding effect upon the present bench,

Secondly, as discussed in length in the case of Bandahamy v. Senanayake it

must be noted that between 1833 to 1971 the Privy Council was the highest Court or

the Court of last resort followed by the Supreme Court as established by the Charter

of 1833 and continued thereafter. In 1971 with the abolition of the right of appeal to

the Privy Council and the establishment of the Court of Appeal, this latter Court as

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 27 of 28

then constituted became the highest Court in the land which was in turn abolished in

1974 by the Administration of Justice Law and a new System of Courts was established

by this law. The new Supreme Court as established under the Administration of Justice

Law became the highest Court in the country. This position continued till 1978 when

the new Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka abolished the

Supreme Court established under the Administration of Justice Law and much of its

jurisdiction was conferred on the Court of Appeal which was made a Court of

subordinate jurisdiction by the creation of the present Supreme Court with supreme

power in all matters of law at the apex of the Judicial system in the country.

Due to this development of law the question arises as to whether the Supreme

Court as established following the abolition of the right to appeal to the Privy Council

is bound by decisions made by a Supreme Court which was not of the last resort prior

to such development.

In the case of Costa v. Jayatilleke SC 265/74-D.C. Mt. Lavinia 47641 /A, Hon.

Vythialingam J held that the Supreme Court under the Administration of Justice Law

being the highest Court under that system was not bound by a decision of the

Supreme Court which preceded it as the latter was a Court subordinate to the Privy

Council. This was cited by Hon. Thamotheram, J in Walker Sons & Co. (U.K.) Ltd. V.

Gunatilake and Others (1979) 1 SLR 231 to the effect that:

The relevant question is which is the court vested with final authority in

any system. The ratio decidendi of cases decided by the Court becomes a

rule for the future binding all courts which are not the courts of last resort

whether it be under the same system or under a different system. It is

always open to the legislature to alter the rule as declared.

As such, it is apparent that only decisions by a court of last resort are binding

upon subsequent court within the same or a different system. Given this clear approach

opted for within the Sri Lankan judicial system, it suffices to say that the present

SC APPEAL 149/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 28 of 28

Supreme Court is not bound by the decisions given in Sivaguru v. Alagaratnam,

Siththiravelu v Ramalingam and Others, and Velautham v Velauther as they were

decided during the period when the Supreme Court was not the Court of last instance.

Considering all the above facts and circumstances and upon examining Section

102 of the Trust Ordinance and cited cases, I find that the Plaintiffs are in compliance

with Section 102 and that the requirements later imposed by the aforementioned cases

are not required by the Trust Ordinance. As such, I hold that this application is

dismissed as there is no merit in this application. The Plaintiffs are entitled to costs for

proceeding at this Court and the Civil Appellate High Court of Vavuniya.

Appeal Dismissed.
