The Petitioners had joined as Volunteer Teachers to work in Government schools in

Southern Province of Sri Lanka. The Government had implemented this as a temporary

measure to address the shortage of teachers then prevailed in the public schools of

several provinces in the country.

After a lapse of some time, then Minister of Education placed before the Cabinet, the

Memorandum dated 28-11-2006 titled Recruitment of Volunteer Teachers serving in

various Provinces in the Island as Teaching Assistants. The said Cabinet Memorandum

dated 28-11-2006 has been produced marked 1R 1. The Cabinet of Ministers having

considered the said Cabinet Memorandum, by its decision dated 04-01-2007, granted the

approval to recruit the Volunteer Teachers referred to therein, as Teacher Assistants

subject to the conditions stipulated in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.5 of the said Cabinet

Memorandum. The said Cabinet Decision dated 04-01-2007 has been produced marked

1R 2.

Consequent to the aforesaid Cabinet Decision (1R 2), applications were called for, from

Volunteer Teachers who have fulfilled the stipulated conditions for the selection of

suitable candidates to be appointed as Teacher Assistants. The newspaper advertisement

calling upon Volunteer Teachers to submit applications for the selection of candidates for

appointment as Teacher Assistants has been produced marked 1R 4. According to the

said advertisement, all applicants were required to be not less than 21 years and not

more than 45 years of age as at 31-12-2005. This requirement was set as a general basic

qualification which qualified anyone to apply for the advertised post. It must also be noted

that the said advertisement (1R 4), has been published as per the instructions given in

the letter dated 14-02-2007 issued by the Minister of Education as per the Cabinet

Decision on 25-10-2006. The Petitioners have produced the said letter dated 14-02-2007

marked P 5 and the 1st Respondent has produced the same letter marked 1R 3.

The Petitioners had accordingly applied for that post and were thereafter summoned for

an interview. The Petitioners have produced the letters dated 15-05-2007, marked P 6

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 8 of 17

(a), P 6 (b), P 6 (c) and P 6 (d) which had summoned them for the said interview. It

is noteworthy at the outset, that the said letters had categorically stated that the purpose

of that interview was not to award appointments but to examine their qualifications.1

Thereafter, a list containing 270 names had been published. Those 270 candidates are

those who had been temporarily recommended for appointment as Teacher Assistants.

This list has been produced marked P 7. The said list contained the names of the

Petitioners. The Petitioners however state that the 1st Respondent thereafter did not take

any action to proceed with the said recommendations.

The Respondents, while admitting the list marked P 7, state that further proceeding

thereof was suspended as per the decision made at a meeting held on 27-08-2007 which

was presided over by the President and attended by the Governors and the Chief Ministers

of the provinces. This is reflected in the letter dated 30-11-2007 produced marked 1R 5

which is signed by the Minister of Education and addressed to the Chief Minister of

Southern Province.

On the 11th of December 2008, the Fundamental Rights application bearing No. SC/FR

580/2008 was filed by its 124 petitioners who had prayed inter alia for: a declaration that

the respondents in that case had infringed their fundamental right guaranteed and

protected under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution by failing to act in terms of the

document produced marked P 7 in that case; a direction from Court to have them

appointed as Teacher Assistants with effect from 01-01-2007. The Supreme Court in that

case had granted Leave to Proceed.

The Petitioners in the instant case, have produced a certified copy of the petition of SC

FR 580/2008 marked P 9. Averments in the petition of SC FR 580/2008 (P 9) shows that

the document produced marked P 7 in that case, is the letter dated 14-02-2007 which

the Petitioners in the instant case, have produced marked P 5 (the 1st Respondent has

produced the same letter marked 1R 3 in the instant application). However, it must be

1 Vide paragraph 3 of those letters.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 9 of 17

noted that the names of the Petitioners of the instant application were not amongst the

names of the petitioners of SC FR 580/2008.

The Minister of Education placed before the Cabinet, the Memorandum dated 15-06-2012

(1R 6) to seek the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to appoint Volunteer Teachers

serving in the Northern Province, as Teacher Assistants. The Cabinet of Ministers having

considered the said Cabinet Memorandum (1R 6), by its decision dated 06-06-2013,

granted the approval to recruit the Volunteer Teachers serving in the Northern Province

as Teacher Assistants subject to the conditions stipulated in the said Cabinet Decision.

The said Cabinet Decision dated 06-06-2013, has been produced marked 1R 7. The

Cabinet of Ministers in the same Cabinet Decision (1R 7) also decided to extend this

approval to the Volunteer Teachers serving in the Southern Province as well on the same

conditions. Although the above approval was granted on four conditions, for the purpose

of this case, it would suffice to set out below, only two of those conditions. The said

conditions are that the candidates should:

(i) have possessed the basic qualifications required to be recruited to the Public

Service; and,

(ii) be under 35 years of age at the time of joining as a Volunteer Teacher.

The above approval (1R 7) given by the Cabinet of Ministers was communicated to the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education of Southern Province by the letter dated 18-06-

2013, produced marked 1R 8.

After collecting and compiling the necessary statistics as per the Cabinet Decision (1R

7), the Minister of Education, having identified in a schedule, those who have fulfilled the

stipulated qualifications as per the previous Cabinet Decisions, had submitted to the

Cabinet, the Memorandum dated 20-12-2013 (1R 9) to seek the approval of the Cabinet

of Ministers to appoint the Volunteer Teachers who have requisite qualifications serving

in the Southern Province, as Teacher Assistants.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 10 of 17

The Cabinet of Ministers having considered the said Cabinet Memorandum (1R 9), by its

decision dated 03-01-2014 granted the approval to recruit the Volunteer Teachers serving

in the Southern Province as Teacher Assistants subject to inter alia, the conditions that

the candidates to be appointed should have:

(i) served in schools in remote areas in the Southern Province for more than 20

years;

(ii) possessed the basic qualifications stipulated for recruitment as Teacher

Assistants; and,

(iii) be under 35 years of age at the time of joining as a Volunteer Teacher.

The said Cabinet Decision dated 03-01-2014 has been produced marked 1R 10.

The above was then communicated to the Ministry of Education of Southern Province by

the letter dated 07-01-2014 produced marked 1R 11.

Thereafter the Petitioners had received letters dated 08-05-2014 [produced marked P 10

(a), P 10 (b), P 10 (c) and P 10 (d)], which had summoned them for another interview

to be held on 22-05-2014. This interview too appears to have been designed only to

examine their qualifications.

Accordingly, subsequent to the examination of the requisite qualifications of the

candidates, two lists were published; one containing a list of Volunteer Teachers who had

satisfied all the requirements (P 13); another containing a list of Volunteer Teachers who

had satisfied all the requirements but were above the age of 45 years (P 14). The

Petitioners names were included in the latter (P 14) as they were above the age of 45

years as at 22-05-2014 (i.e., the date on which the qualifications of the applicants were

verified)

On the 11th of December 2014, the said Fundamental Rights application (SC FR 580/2008)

was withdrawn on the basis that the petitioners in that application had administratively

obtained the relief prayed for in that application. The Court then had terminated the

proceedings in that case.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 11 of 17

Thus, although it is not clear from the documents made available to this Court, it appears

that the 1st Respondent had appointed the petitioners of SC FR 580/2008 as Teacher

Assistants subsequent to the filing of SC FR 580/2008 application as they (the petitioners

of SC FR 580/2008) had fulfilled the conditions as per the Cabinet Decision. The

Petitioners in the instant application were not selected for appointment as Teacher

Assistants as they were above the age of 45 years as at 22-05-2014.

The complaint made by the Petitioners in their petition is that the Respondents have

appointed four candidates who have not fulfilled the necessary requirements. The

Petitioners make a specific allegation that the candidate Ven. Thalagalle Punyasara

(Interview No. VT-173) and the candidate H. T. Jayalatha (Interview No. VT-43) have

been included in the list marked P 13, despite the fact that they were over 45 years of

age. The Petitioners further allege that the candidate M. M. Indika Pujayshwari (Interview

No. VT-112) had been selected despite her failure to provide her date of birth to the 1st

Respondent and the candidate M. H. Nuzra (Interview No. VT-208) had been selected

without even an application being submitted by her. However, it must be noted that the

Petitioners have not sought any relief against the aforesaid candidates despite the

allegation that the appointments of the said candidates were done arbitrarily. Moreover,

the Petitioners have failed to name them as Respondents in the instant application.

Thus, primarily, it is the position of the Petitioners that although they were not selected

for appointment to the posts of Teacher Assistant solely because they were over the age

of 45 years, some candidates who were above the age of 45 years had been appointed

to the post of Teacher Assistant. Petitioners further state that even the 6th Respondent,

despite bringing their grievances to his attention, has failed to take any further step in

relation to their grievances.

It is for the above reasons that the Petitioners state that the failure on the part of the

Respondents not to select the Petitioners for appointment as Teacher Assistants is

arbitrary, irrational, illogical, unlawful and contrary to the Petitioners' legitimate

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 12 of 17

expectations and hence would amount to an act of violation of their Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

It is in that backdrop that the Petitioners in this application have prayed inter alia, for: a

dealation that one or more or all of the Respondents and/or the State have violated their

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution; a direction on

the Respondents to appoint them as Teacher Assistants.

In the instant case, this Court by its order on 01-03-2016, has granted Leave to Proceed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

As has already been stated above, what the Petitioners have alleged in their petition to

this Court is an infringement of their Fundamental Rights on the basis that the

Respondents had discriminated them. The basis for the complained discrimination

according to the petition is the fact that the Respondents had arbitrarily appointed the

above named four candidates.

It must be borne in mind that the approval granted by the Cabinet of Ministers to appoint

the Volunteer Teachers as Teacher Assistants was subject to the condition that the

candidates must have fulfilled the qualifications set out in the Service Minute of Sri Lanka

Teachers Service. This decision is reflected in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 28-11-

2006 (1R 1) and the Cabinet Decision dated 04-01-2007 (1R 2). Further, according to

the newspaper advertisement which called upon the Petitioners to submit applications for

the selection of candidates for appointment as Teacher Assistants (1R 4), all applicants

were required to be not less than 21 years and not more than 45 years of age. It must

also be noted that the said advertisement (1R 4) has been published as per the

instructions given in the letter dated 14-02-2007 (1R 3) issued by the Minister of

Education as per the Cabinet Decision on 25-10-2006.

Respondents have admitted the two lists produced marked P 13 and P 14. The

Petitioners names are found in the list P 14. Thus, the Petitioners were clearly above 45

years of age as at 22-05-2014. As the Petitioners become disqualified to be appointed

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 13 of 17

under the Service Minute of Sri Lanka Teachers Service, the Respondents could not have

lawfully appointed the Petitioners as Teacher Assistants as per the relevant Cabinet

Decisions.

The next question I should consider is whether the Respondents have nevertheless

arbitrarily appointed the four candidates named in the petition.

The Petitioners claim that contrary to the aforementioned Cabinet Decision [1R 10], the

Respondents have appointed four candidates who have not satisfied the requirements in

1R3.

The 1st Respondent has satisfied this Court that there was no arbitrary appointment of

four candidates whose names have been identified in the petition. The 1st Respondent

has supported his stance by producing documents marked 1R 12 (a), 1R 12 (b), 1R

13, 1R 14, 1R 15 and 1R 16. According to those documents it is clear that the

appointment of Ven. Talangalle Punnsara Thero to the post of Teacher Assistant was

cancelled by letter dated 08-11-2015 (1R 12(b)); the candidate H.T. Jayalatha was not

appointed as a Teacher Assistant; both M.H. Nuzra and M.M. Indika Pujeshwari were

appointed as they have satisfied the necessary requirements.

The Petitioners, with regard to the above assertions by the Respondents, had been

content with a mere statement in their counter affidavit to the effect that they are

unaware of the said position.2 However, in view of the aforesaid documents produced by

the 1st Respondent, such a statement by the Petitioners would hardly help them to

substantiate the position they have advanced.

In the light of the above, I am of the view that the Petitioners have failed to prove before

this Court that the Respondents have arbitrarily appointed some candidates who were

above the age of 45 years to the post of Teacher Assistant, discriminating the Petitioners.

I therefore hold that there is no violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution on that basis.

2 Vide paragraph 18 of the counter affidavit filed through motion dated 06-10-2016.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 14 of 17

Although the learned counsel for the Petitioner had attempted to advance a case on

legitimate expectation, I observe that the Petitioners had not presented their application

to this Court on that basis. Thus, the case that the Respondents have met before this

Court is a case on discrimination as alleged in the petition.

It is the position of the Petitioners that they had fulfilled all the qualifications as at 31-

12-2005 which was the date specified in the advertisement published in the Dinamina

newspaper dated 26-03-2007 marked 1R 4. Since the Petitioners were below 45 years

of age as at 31-12-2005 they state that their age should have been calculated as at that

date.

It appears from the sequence of events that the process of recruitment had recommenced

following the filing of the afore-stated Fundamental Rights application (SC FR 580/2008)

by its 124 petitioners. It was thereafter that the Respondents had published the list

marked P 13 which contained the names of Volunteer Teachers qualified to be appointed

as Teacher Assistants. The Respondents had indeed subsequently appointed all of them

as Teacher Assistants.3 It must be noted here that the Respondents in this manner, had

appointed not only the 124 petitioners in SC FR 580/2008 but also all Volunteer Teachers

whose names were found in that list (P 13). Accordingly, the Petitioners in the instant

application have been left out for a good reason. That is because their names had

appeared only in the disqualified list (P 14). It was presumably on the above basis that

the FR application was withdrawn on 11-12-2014 by its 124 petitioners stating that they

had obtained administrative relief.

On the above material, I am convinced that the 1st Respondent after processing the

applications had ensured that all candidates who had fulfilled the specified requirements,

have been appointed as Teacher Assistants. Admittedly, the Petitioners names were not

in the list marked P 13, but in the list marked P 14 which contains the candidates who

have not fulfilled the specified requirements. This shows that the Respondents could not

3 Vide paragraph 17 of the affidavit of the 1st Respondent submitted through motion dated 06.09.2016.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 15 of 17

have appointed the Petitioners in the instant application as they had not fulfilled the

specified requirements.

Learned Senior State Counsel had brought to the attention of this Court that the maximum

age limit of a candidate for the appointment as a Teacher as per the Service Minute of

Sri Lanka Teachers Service, is 35 years.4

As per the Cabinet Decision dated 03-01-2014 (1R 10), the approval (for appointment

as Teacher Assistants) had been granted by the Cabinet of Ministers only to appoint

Volunteer Teachers who were below 35 years of age. This is also the criterion set out in

the Service Minute of Sri Lanka Teachers Service. Clause 7.2.2.3 therein specifies the

minimum and maximum age to join the Sri Lanka Teachers Service respectively as 18

years and 35 years. The fact that the maximum age specified in the Cabinet Decision

dated 03-01-2014 (1R 10), could be logically justified as the said scheme [1R 1, 1R 2]

was introduced to appoint Volunteer Teachers as Teacher Assistants with a view of

subsequently appointing them to Grade 3 of the Sri Lanka Teachers service upon fulfilling

the relevant requirements. Therefore, one must bear in mind that the candidates are

necessarily required to come under the specified age limit set out in the Service Minute

of Sri Lanka Teachers Service, for any candidate who is above the specified age cannot

subsequently be appointed as a Teacher. This was the scheme in the above-mentioned

Cabinet Decision.

In the above circumstances, the complaint made by the Petitioners in their written

submission that the Respondents had changed the recruitment criteria arbitrarily, is

without any justifiable basis and hence cannot be accepted. In any case, as I have already

stated, the Petitioners for the reasons best known to them, had only chosen to mention

their argument on legitimate expectation in their final written submissions and not in the

petition. Therefore, in any case, I cannot accept that legitimate expectation is part of

their case before this Court. Be that as it may, as has already been stated before, the

letters marked P 6 (a), P 6 (b), P 6 (c) and P 6 (d) had categorically stated that the

4 Clause 7.2.2.3 of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1885/38 dated 23-10-2014.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 16 of 17

purpose of that interview was not to award appointments but to examine their

qualifications.5 Thus, the Petitioners in any case, cannot rely on the said letters which

had summoned them for the said interview, to argue that they in any case, had legitimate

expectation to be appointed as Teacher Assistants. This is more so when they particularly

had not fulfilled the conditions stipulated by the authorities. Thus, in the light of the facts

of this case, mere summoning of the Petitioners for an interview to check basic

qualifications cannot on its own, form a basis for a case on legitimate expectation.

The Senior State Counsel who appeared for the Respondents emphasized the fact that

the post of Teacher Assistant is not a post recognized in the Service Minute of Sri Lanka

Teachers Service.6 It is to be noted that the said post had been created to facilitate the

appointment of Volunteer Teachers to the post of Teacher Assistant which was primarily

to cater to the grievances of the Volunteer Teachers who had agitated for appointments.

The Cabinet Decisions read with the relevant Cabinet Memoranda make it clear that the

appointment of Teacher Assistants was contemplated, planned and was to be executed

in such a way that those candidates who would be appointed as Teacher Assistants should

have fulfilled basic qualifications to facilitate their appointment subsequently to Grade 3

of the Sri Lanka Teachers service as per the criterion set out in the Service Minute of Sri

Lanka Teachers Service. (Clause 7.2.2.3 states that the maximum age to join the Sri

Lanka Teachers Service is 35 years).

Accordingly, I find that the Respondents have acted in compliance with the respective

policy decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers and hence committed no discrimination against

the Petitioners.

For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that the Petitioners have not been successful in

establishing that the Respondents have violated their Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. This application is accordingly dismissed. There

will be no costs.

5 Vide paragraph 3 of those letters. 6 Vide written submissions filed by the Senior State Counsel through the motion dated 22-11-2021.

(SC FR 377/2015) - Page 17 of 17

There are two other matters namely SC FR 20/2018 and SC FR 21/2018 pending before

this Court in relation to the same issue. The learned Counsel who represented the

Petitioners in those two matters have agreed, as far as those cases are concerned, to

abide by the judgment that would be pronounced by Court in SC FR 377/2015. Thus, this

judgment must apply to those two cases as well.
