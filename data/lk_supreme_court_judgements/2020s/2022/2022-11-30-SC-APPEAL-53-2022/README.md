S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Complainant-Respondent-Appellant, namely the Attorney General

(“hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant-Appellant”) filed an application in this

Court, against the order by the Court of Appeal dated 19th May 2022, praying for the

Accused-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the “Accused-

Respondent”), to be taken back into custody.

This Application precedes from a complaint filed by the Complainant-Appellant

at the Magistrate Court of Maligakanda, where the Accused-Respondent was ordered

to be kept in remand custody, following which she was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo on the 3rd June 2019, and was charged with:

Possessing and trafficking a quantity of 43.723 grams of heroin,

punishable under Sections 54A (b) and 54A (c) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Amending Act No. 13 of

1984.

A bail application was made on the 25th November 2019, and was refused by

the High Court judge on the same date. Another application was filed on the 14th June

2020 and was refused on said date, where the High Court judge stated that the

Accused-Respondent failed to bring any exceptional circumstances to consider bail as

required by under Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Another bail application was made on 31st July 2020 and was refused by the learned

High Court Judge on same date citing that although it was a serious concern, the fact

that Sub Inspector Udara Chathuranga, the main investigating officer in this case, was

arrested on suspicion for another drug trafficking offence, was not a reason strong

enough to be considered as an exceptional circumstance.

Thereafter the Accused-Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for

judgement to be set aside. After hearing submissions of both parties, the Judge of the

Court of Appeal delivered order dated 08th June 2021, allowing the appeal and

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 14

dismissing the judgement of the High Court. The Accused-Respondent was then

granted bail on the following conditions,

i. cash bail of Rs. one million

ii. surety bail of Rs. two million each

iii. petitioner to surrender her passport to relevant High Court, and the

Registrar to inform the Director of Immigration and Emigration not to

allow the petitioner to leave the country.

iv. The petitioner to report to the police Narcotics bureau on every Sunday

of the month.

(CPA 132/2020)

Being seriously concerned with the said order of the Court of Appeal, the Hon.

Attorney General, Complainant-Appellant made an appeal to this Court seeking the

above judgment to be set aside on the grounds set out in the Petition dated 29th

September 2022. On 13th October 2022, Court granted Leave to Appeal on the

following questions of law,

“Did the Court of Appeal err in law by considering “the morality” as a

yardstick or an exceptional ground in considering an application for

revision in relation to an offence committed under the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs ordinance?”

“Did the Court of Appeal err in law by holding that the “credibility of a

witness” in considering a bail application to be an item of “exceptional

circumstance”?”

In determining the same, the facts and circumstances of this application needs

to be considered.

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 14

The Facts

The Accused-Respondent, namely Madapathage Dona Thilaka Alias Shyamali

was arrested by the Police Narcotic Bureau on 2nd February 2018, for alleged

possession of 120 grams of brown powder suspected to be heroin. During the

investigation, it was referred to the Government Analyst, who found 43.732 grams of

diacetylmorphine (heroin) in the said brown powder.

Hon. Attorney General, preferred an indictment against said Accused-

Respondent. When the matter was pending trial at the High Court, the Accused-

Respondent prayed for bail. The Petitioner-Respondent stated that the fact that the

main investigating officer, namely Sub Inspector Udara having been arrested on

suspicion for another incident involving drugs subsequent to her arrest was an

exceptional circumstance under Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance.

The Petitioner-Respondent then filed a revision application to the Court of

Appeal, for the Court to grant bail. After hearing the revision application, the Court of

Appeal delivered judgement on 08th June 2021, and granted bail to the Accused-

Respondent. The learned SDSG submits that the Accused-Respondent has suppressed

very important material facts, namely her previous convictions on drug related matters

was not submitted to the Court of Appeal in her revision application, of which the

Court of Appeal has not seriously considered.

Given that this application is based on the granting of bail under the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 1984, Section 83 (1) on bail

is of relevance. This provides that:

No person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54A or 54B of

this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the High Court in

exceptional circumstances.

The said offences under Section 54A and 54B are as follows:

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 14

54A. Prohibition against manufacture, trafficking, import or export and

possession of dangerous drugs.

54B. Abetting in the commission of an offence under section 54A.

However, exceptional circumstances are not defined in the said Ordinance, and

are considered on a case-by-case basis. This can be seen in the decision of Ramu

Thamodarampillai vs The Attorney General SC 141/75 (2004) 3 SLR 180, where

His Lordship Vythialingam, J held that,

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.”

As the case at hand deals with the possession and trafficking of heroin, it is

essential to establish that heroin falls within the definition of a dangerous drug under

Sri Lankan law. As per Article 48 of Chapter V of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance,

(1) the drugs, substances, articles or preparations, specified for the time

being in Groups A, B, C, D and E in Part I of the Third Schedule, shall

be deemed to be dangerous drugs

The narcotic drug heroin, also referred to by its chemical name

diacetylmorphine can be found in the 49th place in the Third Schedule of the

Conventions Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act

No. 1 of 2008. Hence, it is established that heroin is a dangerous drug which falls within

the prohibition under Section 54A. As the Accused-Respondent was in possession of

43.723 grams of heroin, we can further establish that she committed the offence of

possessing and trafficking said heroin. Bail application must therefore be considered

under Section 83 to determine whether exceptional circumstances apply.

As per the order of the High Court Judge, bail was refused on three accounts,

1. First account dated 25th November 2019

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 14

2. Second account dated 14th June 2020

3. Final account dated 31st July 2020.

The Sub Inspector Udara, the main investigating officer and witness providing

evidence at the trial of the Accused-Respondent, as well as a few other police officers

were arrested on suspicion after the indictment of Accused-Respondent for trafficking

and smuggling of dangerous drugs.

The stance of the Accused-Respondent was that the fact that the Sub Inspector

and witness providing evidence at her trial being arrested on suspicion at the time of

indictment of Accused-Respondent, for another drug-related offence was enough to

constitute exceptional circumstances as under Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984. This, according to the Accused-

Respondent, would constitute an exceptional circumstance because it allegedly infers

unreliability of the witness.

However, the High Court judge stated on all three instances that the Accused-

Respondent failed to bring any exceptional circumstances to consider bail, and the

said exceptional circumstance of the Sub Inspector being arrested for a separate

incident, while serious, did not constitute a serious enough issue to be categorized as

an exceptional circumstance under Section 83, stating;

“මෙෙ නඩුමෙ ප්‍රධාන ෙැටලීම් නිලධාරියා මෙනත් නඩුෙක සැකකරැමෙක් මලස

සිටීෙ පෙණක් චුදිතට ඇප නියෙ කිරිෙ සඳහා වූ සුවිම ේෂ කරුණක් මලස සැලකිය

මනාහැකි බෙ ොමේ අදහසයි. එෙ කරුණ ප්‍රධාන ෙැටලීම් නිලධාරියාමේ සාක්ිමේ

සාක්ිෙය වි ේෙසනීයත්ෙයට බලපාන කරුණක් විය හැකි නමුත් එය චුදිතට ඇප

නියෙ කිරීෙ සඳහා වූ සුවිම ේෂ කරුණක් මලස මම් අෙසේථාමේ සැලකිය මනාහැක.”

For ease of reference, the translation of the above statement says that

“In my opinion, the fact that the chief investigating officer in this case is

a suspect in another case cannot be considered as a special factor for

granting bail to the accused. That fact may affect the evidentiary

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 14

credibility of the evidence of the chief raiding officer but it cannot be

considered as an exceptional ground for granting bail to the accused at

this time.”

The Court of Appeal considered the High Court judge’s decision to be flawed,

and that their finding as to the officers who conducted the raid being accused in other

similar cases as not an exceptional ground to be considered for bail under Section 83,

was not seen as,

“being very correct because it causes a serious doubt in the

investigations conducted by these officers as to the truthfulness of the

same, therefore the question arises whether it is morally correct to

keep an accused in remand until the conclusion of the trial under those

circumstances. (Emphasis Added)

Further, the conclusion of the trial appears rushed as the Judge of the Court of

Appeal had also quoted that

“although the trial has commenced the current corona situation in the

country which has affected the smooth running of the judicial system

might delay the conclusion of the trial hence in view of the exceptional

behavior of the investigative officers, this court decides to enlarge the

petitioner on bail.”

In answering the first question of law, it appears that the judge of the Court of

Appeal has considered “morality” as a yardstick or an exceptional ground in

considering an application for revision in relation to an offence committed under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs ordinance, where it was stated that

“the question arises whether it is morally correct to keep an accused in

remand until the conclusion of the trial under those circumstances”

As per the Oxford Dictionary, “morality” is defined as

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 14

“principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good

and bad behaviour”,

whereas the same defines “law” to be

“the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes

as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the

imposition of penalties”.

It is of utmost importance to note that while these two are similar and often

rely on one another, all persons in law are aware of the distinctions drawn between

the two grounds in the study of Jurisprudence as morality not being an essential

criterion for legality as they are in fact, different to one another. Hence, using morality

as a yardstick for justice not only muddies the waters of law, but it would also set an

unclear precedent.

In the present case, the morality of the decision of the High Court to keep the

Accused-Respondent in remand custody until the conclusion of the trial has been

questioned by the Court of Appeal, and in the Court of Appeal, it was decided that this

was,

“not fair and justifiable”,

and bail was granted to Accused-Respondent on this account.

However, in case of Cader (On Behalf of Rashid Khan) vs Officer-In-Charge

Narcotics Bureau CA 123/2005 (2006) 3 SLR 74 His Lordship Eric Basnayake, J held

that,

"These types of offences affect the society at large. The law should not

be made impotent that it does not serve the Society and the antisocial

elements should not be given licence to create havoc in Society.”

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 14

Stemming from the fact that heroin is a drug that is difficult to detect in most

cases, the tendency of criminals to resort to committing this type of crime has been

quite high.

I must also observe that Accused-Respondent had suppressed very important

material in revision application to the Court. The Accused-Respondent failed to bring

to the attention of court regarding two previous convictions of similar nature.

i. Possession of 1000 mg of heroin – Rs. 75000 fine imposed on

11.03.1997 (Maligakanda Magistrates Court Case Number

73873/1997)

ii. Possession and trafficking of less than one gram of heroin – A sentence

of one year of Rigorous Imprisonment imposed suspended to seven

years by High Court of Colombo on 14.03.2012. Accused-Respondent

was arrested for the present case during the operative period of this

suspended sentence. (Colombo High Court Case Number

5846/2011)

However, the Learned Judge of the Court of Appeal, while having acknowledged

this fact as;

“that the petitioner has failed to state the previous convictions, which this court is

unable to endorse.”

has failed to give sufficient weight to this in the final conclusion, and appears

to have disregarded it. As such it is merely an acknowledgement of the same but

appears not to have had any real effect on the conclusion which is irregular in an

application of this nature.

Furthermore, drawing from Hon. Eric Basnayake, J in Cader (On Behalf of

Rashid Khan) vs Officer-In-Charge Narcotics Bureau (Supra),

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 14

“The repetitive factor prevalent in this sort of crime and the difficulty of

detection are significantly strong reasons for refusing bail in this type

of cases.”

We can see that the Accused-Respondent has hidden the fact she was

previously penalized for committing two previous similar offences. Considering the

morality of the decision of the High Court seems insignificant in the face of her

penchant to commit offences under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

ordinance.

Hence, as there is no legal basis of considering morality as a yardstick in an

application for or revision in relation to an offence committed under the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs ordinance, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal has

erred in considering morality as a yardstick or an exceptional ground in an application

for revision in relation to an offence committed under the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

In order to arrive at a conclusion on whether the creditworthiness of the

witnesses is questionable, the tests of creditworthiness that can be tested on the

witnesses can be referred to.

An important test of creditworthiness is whether the witness is an interested or

disinterested witness. Hon. Rajaratnam J. in Tudor Perera v. AG SC 23/75 (Supreme

Court Minutes dated 1st November 1975) perceived that when considering the

evidence of an interested witness who may wish to conceal the truth, such evidence

must be inspected with due diligence. The independent witness will normally be

favoured over an interested witness in case of conflict. In the present case, since the

witness is neither a close relative, nor a person whose interests are closely associated

with the Accused-Respondent, it appears that there are no circumstances of affiliation

shedding doubt on the independence of the witness, and his evidence will be

evaluated by the trial court.

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 14

There are further elements to be considered in the issue regarding the

credibility of witnesses.

Firstly, that at the time of the initial trial, the Sub Inspector was arrested on

suspicion of possessing and smuggling large quantities of narcotics, however, it must

be emphasised that he was only suspected in an ongoing investigation, and at the

time there was no conclusion to the trial finding him guilty of the crimes he was

accused of. At the time of granting bail to the Accused-Respondent by the Court of

Appeal, he was not a convict.

Secondly, it must be noted that the incident that the witness is being

investigated and inquired for is a case that has no relation to the present case at hand,

and the two cases are not part of the same transaction. Sub Inspector Udara

Chathuranga, at the time of being questioned at the High Court, was detained by the

Criminal Investigation Department for a separate investigation. While the offences

may be similar, it is clear that both of the incidents are totally independent of one

another, and thus it is the view of this Court that he is more than capable of presenting

clear evidence for this case. Further, as he was the main officer responsible for the

current investigation into the Accused-Respondent, it is crucial that he stands as a

witness, to paint a picture of the events that took place.

In deciding whether the Court of Appeal erred by finding that the witness, the

chief investigating police officer, was an uncreditable witness, it is essential to refer to

previous judgements.

In the case of Kumara De Silva And 2 Others Vs. Attorney General CA 4/2003

(2010) 2 SLR 169 it was held that

“Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or rejection of

evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the trial Judge.”

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 14

Hence, as seen in the above judgement, it is inappropriate for someone other

than the trial judge to conclude whether or not a witness has credibility. If the trial

judge finds him not to be creditworthy, it is a matter to be considered among other

things such as whether other witnesses are available. Hence, creditworthiness must be

decided by a court of first instance, which has not been done. The trial judge has not

found fault with the credibility of the witness, and therefore it is of no relevance to the

appellate judge.

Furthermore, when employing the tests relevant to this case, we can see that

the creditworthiness of the witness has not been impugned as of yet. Even if the

conduct of the said witness does not constitute a creditworthy action, this Court is of

the view that it is not a serious enough concern to be classified as an “exceptional

circumstance” under Section 83.

This is especially so as creditworthiness of witness is not a matter which is

relevant to the granting of Bail. It is a consideration that is redundant to the

questioning of whether there are exceptional circumstances and cannot bear any

weight as a ground for granting bail.

This is due to the fact that the character of people would not be of great

importance when being presented as a witness in an unrelated case, for the simple

reason that the said witness merely appeared in official capacity, regarding an official

function in that capacity.

Therefore, under these circumstances, no material is before the Court of Appeal

to come to a decision regarding if the witness is creditworthy, nor is it relevant to the

granting of Bail in this application in the first place. Hence, it cannot be considered as

an “exceptional ground” in considering an application for revision.

Considering all, it appears that the finding of the Judge of the Court of Appeal

is unsubstantiated and flouts the accepted norms of law. I am inclined to answer both

SC Appeal 53/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 14

questions of law presented in front of this Court in the affirmative. Therefore, I set aside

the order given by the Court of Appeal.

Appeal is allowed. Bail order is cancelled.

Further, on the request of the learned SDSG and considering all the facts I direct

the learned High Court Judge to take Accused-Respondent back into custody, and to

conclude trial expeditiously.
