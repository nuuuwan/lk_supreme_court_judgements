The plaintiff-respondent-respondent (hereinafter called the “respondent”) instituted action in the

District Court of Kegalle to partition the land in extent 3 roods and 18 perches, called “Galpeelle

Weralugahamulla Hena presently Watta” that was more fully described in the schedule to the

plaint. Initially there were four defendants and the 5th defendant was added on the latter’s

application to intervene.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

The respondent having pleaded the pedigree moved that the shares be allocated as set out below:

respondent - 7/216 from the land and ½ share of the two buildings and the copra hut

1st defendant – 129/216

2nd defendant - 52/216

3rd defendant - 21/216

4th defendant – 7/216 from the land and ½ share of the two buildings and the copra hut

The 2nd defendant-appellant-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “appellant”) pleaded that the

shares be allocated according to the pedigree set out in his amended statement of claim dated 17

February 2006 and the land and the buildings be partitioned accordingly.

The learned District Judge in his judgment directed the partition of the land inter alia as follows:

respondent – ½ of the copra hut and ½ of the two boutique premises and ½ of the land upon

which the copra hut and the two boutique premises falls;

appellant – undivided 87/216 shares (excluding the copra hut and the two boutique premises and

the land upon which the copra hut and the two boutique premises falls);

½ share of the copra hut, ½ share of the two boutique premises and ½ share of the land upon

which the copra hut and the two boutique premises falls, were left un allocated.

The appellant appealed against the said judgment. Appellant’s grievance was the manner in

which the two boutique premises and the copra hut was allocated by the District Court. The Civil

Appellate High Court by its’ judgment dated 01.09.2016, dismissed the said appeal.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the appellant sought

leave to appeal from this Court and this Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions

of law.

(i). Have the learned judges of the High Court erred in law in failing to appreciate and

consider that the 2nd Defendant is entitled to ½ share of the two boutiques situated near

SC APPEAL 117/2017

4

the Western boundary of the corpus depicted as ‘C’ in Preliminary Plan No 1906 dated

19.05.1998 prepared by P.M.G. Munasinghe, Licensed Surveyor?

(ii) Have the learned judges of the High Court erred in law in failing to appreciate and

consider that the 2nd Defendant is the absolute owner of the copra hut situated near the

Western boundary of the corpus depicted as ‘D’ in Preliminary Plan No 1906 dated

19.05.1998 prepared by P.M.G. Munasinghe, Licensed Surveyor?

(iii) Have the learned judges of the High Court erred in law failing to appreciate and consider

that the learned trial judge erred by not granting ½ of the said boutiques and the said

copra hut to the 2nd Defendant ?

The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the grievance of the appellant against the

judgments of both the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court is the allocation of the

two boutique premises and the copra hut.

Therefore, this judgment is confined to the issues relating to the allocation of the two boutique

premises and the copra hut and does not deal with the allocation of shares relating to the land

excluding the two boutique premises and the copra hut.

In the preliminary plan No 1906 dated 19.05.1998 prepared by P.M.G.Munasinghe licensed

surveyor the two boutique premises are depicted as house marked ‘C’ and the copra hut is

depicted as house marked ‘D’. Therefore, it is clear that the two boutique premises and the copra

hut are two separate entities that are detached and could be identified separately. According to

the surveyor’s report, the appellant had claimed both these buildings.

The appellant’s claim to one of the two boutique premises (1/2 share of the building identified as

‘C’ – two boutique premises) is on the basis that his parents Ukkuwa and Silindu co-owned the

thatched house that existed at the time they gained title as co-owners of the land together with

the thatched house situated therein, in the year 1940 and subsequently in the year 1990 his

mother Silindu, transferred all her rights to the appellant. However, the learned counsel for the

respondent submitted that it was Ukkuwa who improved the thatched house and converted it to

the present form, which consists of two boutique premises and therefore said Ukkuwa had sole

rights of the two boutique premises. Thereafter Ukkuwa in the year 1990 gifted the aforesaid

SC APPEAL 117/2017

5

two boutique premises to the respondent and another person called Somawathie. Therefore, he

contends that the respondent is entitled to ½ share of the two boutique premises and the appellant

has no valid claim to the said two boutique premises.

There is no dispute on the fact that the building described as ‘two boutique premises’ in the

preliminary plan 1906, was identified as a ‘thatched house’ at initial stages which was

subsequently improved.

It is pertinent to observe that there is no contest between the parties relating to the devolution of

rights and shares unto Ukkuwa and Silindu. There is no contradiction between the pedigrees

submitted by both parties, in relation to the same. Admissions 1, 3 and 5 recorded in the District

Court also confirm the same. Furthermore, parties admit that the rights of Silindu devolved on

the appellant. However, the claim and the counter claim by the appellant and the respondent in

relation to the two boutique premises is based on the issue whether Silindu had any right to the

two boutique premises at the time she transferred her rights to the appellant, or not.

Competing claims on the copra hut situated on the land also arises due to a series of gifts and

cancellation of such gifts and subsequent transfers effected by said Ukkuwa.

It was one P.G.Bandiya who had initially transferred his rights in the relevant land in extent three

roods and eighteen perches together with the ‘thatched house’ situated therein to his daughter

Silindu and son-in-law Ukkuwa by the deed bearing No.1020 dated 19 September 1940 and

attested by J.P.W.Gunaseka Notary Public – the deed produced marked 2V1. Both parties

concede that the ‘thatched house’ referred to in the said deed was later improved and is presently

referred to as ‘the two boutique premises’.

Silindu in the year 1987 by deed No. 53937 attested by S.G.Patikiri Arachchi, Notary Public

gifted an ‘undivided 1/4th share of the land in extent three roods and eighteen perches’ which is

more-fully described in the schedule of the said deed, to the appellant. The said deed is produced

marked 2V2. However, it is pertinent to observe that the aforesaid deed 53937 does not make

any reference to deed No. 1020 dated 19th September 1940 (2V1). Furthermore, in deed 53937

(2V2) it is claimed that Silindu’s rights were derived from a deed that was not available at the

time the deed 53937 was attested. (....දැනට ඉදිරිපිට නැති ඔප්පුවක් පිට අයිතිව නිරවුල්ව භුක්ති

විඳින...) It is also important to note that there is no reference to the ‘thatched house’, in the said

SC APPEAL 117/2017

6

deed. However, three years thereafter, in the year 1990 said Silindu had transferred undivided ½

share of the two boutique premises to the appellant by the deed No. 4758, attested by

K.Wijesundara Notary Public on 22 October 1990. The said deed 4758 was produced marked

2V3. This deed describes Silindu’s rights as rights derived from the deed No 1020 dated 19th

September 1940 (2V1).

An examination of deed 53937 (2V2) reveals that no reference is made to the fact that Silindu

co-owned with Ukkuwa the undivided 1/4th share of the land in extent three roods and eighteen

perches, in the said deed dated 20th December 1987. Furthermore, the said deed does not make

any specific reference to any building situated therein. Specific reference to “undivided ½ share

of two boutique premises” is made in the deed attested three years later – deed No. 4758 dated

22 October 1990 (2V3). Silindu by the last mentioned deed 4758 (2V3) attested by

K.Wijesundera Notary Public, transferred undivided ½ share of the two boutique premises to the

appellant. Appellant’s claim to the ½ share of the two boutique premises is based on the last

mentioned deed where Silindu transfers her rights to him.

However, it is pertinent to observe that Ukkuwa, initially in the year 1981 had gifted the two

boutique premises to the father of the respondent – R.G.Piyasena - by the deed 12174 dated 01

January 1981 attested by S.M.B.Jayaratne, Notary Public (which was produced P7). However,

thereafter in the year 1984 Ukkuwa proceeded to cancel the last mentioned deed by the deed

13114 dated 31 October 1984, attested by S.M.B.Jayaratne, Notary Public (which was produced

2V4). Thereafter in the year 1990, one month prior to the execution of the deed 4758 (2V3) by

Silindu, Ukkuwa had transferred the two boutique premises to the respondent and another person

named Somawathie, by the deed no. 5326 dated 24th September 1990, attested by N.M.Jayatilake

Notary Public. The said deed 5326 was produced marked P9. The Respondent’s claim in relation

to undivided ½ share of the two boutique premises is on the basis that it was Ukkuwa who had

the sole rights to the two boutique premises and thereafter the said Ukkuwa transferred his rights

to the respondent and another person named Somawathie. It was contended that Ukkuwa derives

sole rights to the said two boutique premises as it was he who improved and converted the

‘thatched house’ into two boutique premises. On this basis it was further contended that Ukkuwa

had the right to transfer the entirety of the boutique premises to the respondent and Somawathie

leaving ½ share to each of them. It is the respondent’s claim, that Silindu’s subsequent transfer

SC APPEAL 117/2017

7

of ½ share of the two boutique premises to the appellant by the deed 4758 (2V3) has no force of

law and therefore the appellant’s claim of ½ share on the boutique premises should fail.

The learned District Judge had accepted the position taken up by the respondent. The learned

judge is of the view that the respondent on a balance of probability had established that Ukkuwa

having improved the thatched house into two boutique premises thereafter transferred the said

two boutique premises to the respondent and Somawathie. The learned trial judge further

observed that Silindu had not raised any objections to the transfer of the entirety of the two

boutique premises by Ukkuwa but had later on made the transfer of her rights to the appellant.

On these grounds the learned trial judge held that ½ share of the boutique premises should be

allocated to the respondent and balance ½ share should be left unallocated as Somawathie was

not a party to the proceedings.

The learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court are of the view that the learned trial judge

had correctly analysed all material and allocated shares accordingly. Therefore, they dismissed

the appeal. However, it is pertinent to observe that the learned judges of the High Court before

reaching the conclusion on the allocation of shares by the learned trial judge had observed, that it

is only one premises of the two boutique premises that had transferred to the respondent

according to the deeds that were produced. This observation is vague and contradictory to the

evidence presented at trial. The respondent’s position before trial court - the position which was

accepted as proved by the trial court, was that Ukkuwa who alone had sole rights to both

boutique premises transferred all his such rights to the respondent and said Somawathie.

In examining the transfer of rights by Ukkuwa and Silindu in relation to the two boutique

premises, the main issue that is to be considered is whether it was Ukkuwa who had sole rights to

the two boutique premises in view of the improvements purported to have been made or whether

Ukkuwa and Silindu continued to enjoy equal rights – ½ share each – to the said two boutique

premises. In this regard it is pertinent to observe that the two boutique premises did not exist

when Bandia initially transferred the land with the thatched house to Ukkuwa and Silindu in the

year 1940. Reference to two boutique premises was made for the first time in the deeds 12173

(2V5) and 12174 (P7) made in the year 1981. Both parties concede that it was the ‘thatched

house’ that was later improved and became the ‘two boutique premises’. Therefore, it is clear

that initially Ukkuwa and Silindu co-owned the land and the thatched house situated thereon

SC APPEAL 117/2017

8

together with the soil underneath and improvements to the co-owned thatched house situated in

the co-owned land were made at a later stage.

Under these circumstances, the main issue that has to be examined is whether both Ukkuwa and

Silindu who continues to co-own the land has a co-ownership to the boutique premises situated

thereon too? The learned trial judge’s conclusion that Ukkuwa had sole rights when he

transferred the two boutique premises first in 1981 by way of a gift and thereafter in 1990 after

cancelling the said gift is on the basis that the plaintiff-respondent succeeded on a balance of

probability to prove that it was Ukkuwa who effected improvements to the thatched house and

converted to the two boutique premises.

In this regard it is also important to examine whether there is evidence as to who made those

improvements and if so does the fact that who made those improvements to the initial thatched

house becomes relevant in determining the rights of Ukkuwa and Silindu?

The respondent, an uncle of respondent namely M.D.S.Manathunga, the appellant and the third

defendant-respondent-respondent who is a sister of the appellant, had testified at the trial. The

respondent is a nephew of the appellant and the appellant is a son of Ukkuwa and Silindu. The

respondent who was thirty eight years at the time of his testimony had said that it was his

grandfather Ukkuwa who built the two boutique premises. The respondent, would have been

born in the year 1973. Therefore by the time the existence of the two boutique premises was

recorded in a deed for the first time in 1981, the respondent was a boy of around eight years of

age. Witness Manathunga also in his examination in chief had said it was Ukkuwa who built the

two boutique premises. However, the third-defendant-respondent-respondent who is a daughter

of Ukkuwa and Silindu and who was born when Silindu and Ukkuwa were living in the land in

question, in the examination in chief had said that both Ukkuwa and Silindu built the two

boutique premises and members of the family, including the appellant and the respondent’s

father were living there. This witness was born in the year 1949. In the cross examination this

witness had said that she ‘did not see’ who built the said two boutique premises. However, she

had said that it was both Ukkuwa and Silindu who made the improvements. It is also pertinent to

observe that both the respondent and the uncle of respondent had not explained whether they had

first hand information as to who improved the thatched house or built the two boutique premises.

The learned trial judge had not elaborated the basis on which he accepts evidence presented on

SC APPEAL 117/2017

9

behalf of the respondent that Ukkuwa built the two boutique premises, on a balance of

probability. In my view the evidence is very scanty in this regard. One other factor that the

learned trial judge had taken into account in reaching this conclusion is that Silindu had not

raised any objections when Ukkuwa transferred the two boutique premises mentioned above. In

this regard also it is pertinent to observe that there is no sufficient evidence to establish that

Silindu had prior knowledge of the transfers made by Ukkuwa. Furthermore, it is pertinent to

observe that the third-defendant-respondent-respondent in her evidence said that her mother

Silindu did not agree with the manner in which Ukkuwa distributed the property as she was of

the view that all three children should be benefitted.

It is settled law that when a person builds on a land the title of the building remains with the

person who has the title to the land on which it was built.

“Accession was a primary mode of acquisition of property recognised by Civil Law.

Exceptions were admitted in regard to movable property for cogent reason of policy, but

as far as land was concerned, it was an absolute principal that structures and plantations

acceded to the soil and enured to the benefit of the owner of soil. The rule whatever is

built or cultivated on land becomes part of the land, was received without modification in

Roman-Dutch law and applied equally to the case of a person building on his land with

materials of another and to that of a person building on another’s land with his own

materials” – “The Law of Property in Sri Lanka” by G.L.Peiris, Vol I, page 29

(Third Re-print -2009).

In De Silva v Haramanis et al, 3 NLR 160 at 160, it was held that

“A house becomes the property of the owners of the soil on which it is built. Between the

owners and the builders there may exist equities, such as a right to compensation, &c, but

the ownership of a building cannot (in the ordinary case) be in another”.

I need hardly emphasize that the maxim “omne quod inaedificator solo, solo cedit” is now trite

law. Every thing that is built on land or on another immovable property accedes to that land or

immovable property and it becomes the property of the owner of the land as immovable (E.

Poste, Gai Institutiones …, 4th ed.., Oxford, (1904) p.73: The Jurisprudence of Holland by Hugo

Grotius 2.1.13 - Translated by R.W.Lee (1926) at Chapter X item 6, page 119.)

SC APPEAL 117/2017

10

However, a person who builds on the land of another may have the right to compensation and the

right to retention until compensation is paid. These rights depend on many factors including the

status of the improver such as a bona fide occupier etc;. In Hassanally v Cassim, 61 NLR 529 at

532 Viscount Simmonds stated,

"the right of the improver to compensation rests on the broad principle that the true

owner is not entitled to take advantage, without making compensation, of the

improvements effected by one who makes them in good faith believing himself to be

entitled to enjoy them whether, for a term or in perpetuity ".

In relation to the rights of a co-owner who effects improvements with the knowledge that the

property is owned in common and that he is entitled, at partition only to a share of the land,

proportionate to his interest, it is observed that,

“the equitable rights of the improver have to be restricted appropriately, for the purpose

of protection of the other co-owners’ interests” - “The Law of Property in Sri Lanka”

by G.L.Peiris, Vol I, page 46 (Third Re-print -2009).

Further more, in De Silva v Siyadoris et. al. 14 NLR 268 at 270, it is observed that :

“… the co-owner who puts up a building on the common property is in a totally different

position from a person who, under agreement with the owner, builds on the land of

another. The co-owner in such a case acquires no title in severalty as against the other

owners. One co-owner could prevent him from building on the common property without

the consent of the other co-owners (Silva v. Silva, 6 NLR 22), but the building once

erected accedes to the soil and becomes part of the common property. The right of the

builder is limited to a claim for compensation, which he could enforce in a partition

action under sections 2 and 5 of Ordinance No. 10 of 1863.”

When the case of the respondent is considered in the context of the above discussed legal

principles it is clear that Ukkuwa who co-owned the land and the thatched house with Silindu

does not gain the title of the two boutique premises as a sole owner excluding Silindu, even in a

situation where Ukkuwa had made improvements to the thatched house. If at all, his rights to the

SC APPEAL 117/2017

11

two boutique premises are the ½ share of the two boutique premises and a right to compensation

for the improvements provided that there is evidence to the effect that he was solely responsible

for the improvements.

Furthermore, in Abideen Hadjiar v Aiysha Umma et al , 68 NLR 411 the rights of an improver

who made improvements to the benefit of the owner was discussed. In the said case the court

held,

“The principle of unjust enrichment has no application where the improver effected the

improvements for the benefit of the owner. The essence of a claim for compensation is that

the improver expected to enjoy the benefit of the improvements for a term or in perpetuity. In

this case, apart from any presumption of advancement in favour of the wife, the 2nd

defendant has expressly stated that he effected the improvements in the interests of his wife

and children, that is, for their benefit. He cannot put forward his claim after the death of his

wife when he had no intention at the time he effected the improvements, to make any such

claim against his wife.

The 2nd defendant's position is no different even if he effected the improvements with the

express or implied consent of his wife, the owner, because he did so for her benefit”. (at page

413)

The legal principle set out in Abideen Hadjiar (supra) in my view is equally applicable to right

to compensation of an improver who is a co-owner.

In this regard, the evidence of the third-defendant-respondent-respondent who is a daughter of

Ukkuwa and Silindu is also relevant. According to her, both Ukkuwa and Silindu at one stage

had lived in one of the two boutique premises with their children. It is reasonable to infer that

even if it was Ukkuwa who was solely responsible for improvements, Ukkuwa had made those

improvements for the benefit of the co-owner, his wife Silindu, too. In the absence of any

evidence that Ukkuwa made those improvements with the intention of claiming compensation

from Silindu – his wife - Ukkuwa cannot have a claim for compensation against her or her

successors.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

12

When the facts of the matter under consideration are examined in the context of the legal

principles discussed above, Ukkuwa could not have had rights other than for a half share of the

two boutique premises when he transferred his rights by the deed 12174 (P7) in 1981 or by deed

5326 (P9) to the respondent and another person in the year 1990. Silindu’s entitlement to ½ share

of the land and thatched house that had accrued from the deed No 1020 dated 19th September

1940 (2V1) remained intact. The transfer of her rights to the land in 1987 by deed 53937 (2V2)

and the subsequent transfer of her rights to the ½ share of the two boutique premises to the

appellant by the deed No. 4758 (2V3) in the year 1990 are lawful and valid transfers. Therefore,

the appellant is entitled to ½ share of the building identified as ‘two boutique premises’ and

depicted as ‘C’ in Preliminary Plan No 1906 dated 19.05.1998 prepared by P.M.G. Munasinghe,

Licensed Surveyor. The Respondent’s entitlement to the said premises is 1/4th share only and the

remaining 1/4th share has to be left un-allotted.

Therefore, the learned trial judge as well as the learned judges of the High Court had erred when

they held that the appellant has no rights to the two boutique premises and allocated ½ share of

the said premises to the respondent.

In view of these findings, I answer the question no. (i), on which leave was granted, in the

affirmative.

I will now proceed to examine the issues pertaining to the allocation of shares relating to copra

hut. The said copra hut is depicted as the house marked D in the preliminary plan No 1906 dated

19.05.1998, prepared by P.M.G.Munasinghe licensed surveyor.

The appellant’s claim to the copra hut is on the premise that Ukkuwa in the year 1981 by deed of

gift 12173 dated 01 January 1981 transferred his rights relating to the remaining land and

buildings to the appellant, other than the two boutique premises and the land underneath the two

boutique premises. The said deed 12173, attested by S.M.B.Jayaratne, Notary Public was

produced marked 2V5. The appellant claims that the copra hut did not exist at the time Silindu

and Ukkuwa became co-owners of the land and the thatched house in the year 1940, but was

later built by Ukkuwa. It is his position that when Ukkuwa transferred buildings situated in the

land excluding the two boutique premises by the aforesaid deed 12173 (2V5), the rights of

Ukkuwa in relation to the said copra hut also passed on to him and remained with him. It was

SC APPEAL 117/2017

13

further submitted, that the aforementioned claim of the appellant is further strengthened on the

basis that Ukkuwa transferred his rights on the two boutique premises to the respondent’s father

on the same day by deed 12174 which was produced marked P7 and therefore the ‘buildings’

referred to in deed 12173 (2V5) is in reference to the ‘copra hut’.

However, the respondent disputes this claim. The respondent’s claim to the copra hut is based on

the deed of transfer executed by Ukkuwa on 24 September 1990. The said deed bearing number

5326 attested by N.M.Jayathilake Notary Public was produced marked P9. Ukkuwa by this deed

5326 purported to have transferred his rights to the copra hut to the respondent and one

Somawathie. It is the respondent’s contention that even if it is admitted that Ukkuwa’s rights to

the copra hut was transferred to the appellant by a prior deed in 1981 - deed 12173 (2V5), such

rights became transferred to the plaintiff respondent due to the execution of the deed of

revocation 1587 dated 23 December 1990 attested by S.K.S.Dissanayake, Notary Public, on

account of the operation of the doctrine exceptio rei venditae et traditae. The aforesaid deed

1587 was produced marked 2V6. It is the contention of the plaintiff-respondent that Ukkuwa’s

regaining rights to the copra hut immediately passes to the respondent and Somawathie since

Ukkuwa had transferred the copra hut to the plaintiff-respondent and Somawathie at a time when

he had no title.

It was further contended that the deed of trasfer bearing No 1588, attested by

S.K.S.Dissanayake, Notary Public on 23 December 1990, which was produced marked 2V7, fail

to pass on the rights relating to the copra hut, even though the said deed 1588 was executed on

the same day as the deed of revocation.

It was also contended that all rights relating to the copra hut did immediately pass to the

respondent with the execution of the deed of revocation, since the operation of the maxim

exceptio rei venditae et traditae validated the prior deed 5326 (P9).

It is pertinent to observe that according to the evidence that transpired at the trial the copra hut

had been built in the year 1961 and was used in the coconut business carried on by Ukkuwa. As

it was discussed hereinbefore, both Ukkuwa and Silindu had lived with their children in one of

the boutique premises and Ukkuwa was engaged in his business there. Therefore it is reasonable

to infer that Ukkuwa built the copra hut to the benefit of his family. Based on the legal principles

SC APPEAL 117/2017

14

discussed hereinbefore, title to the said copra hut would devolve on both Ukkuwa and Silindu

who were the co-owners of the land, even though it was Ukkuwa who built it. It is also pertinent

to observe, as it was referred to earlier in this judgment, that there is no dispute that all rights of

Silindu had been transferred to the appellant.

Therefore, the appellant is entitled to the rights of Silindu on a ½ share of the copra hut.

The rights of the appellant and the respondent deriving from the rights of Ukkuwa on the balance

½ share of the copra hut needs to be determined on the nature of transactions that had taken place

through four deeds referred to herein before. Those four deeds are; deed 12173(2V5), deed

5326(P9), deed 1587 (2V6) and deed 1588 (2V7). The Transfer of rights in relation to the copra

hut based on these four deeds can be summarised as follows:

Ukkuwa in the year 1981 initially had transferred his rights on the copra hut to the appellant by a

deed of gift and thereafter in September 1990 transferred the same rights to the respondent by a

deed of transfer. Three months later Ukkuwa cancels the gift made to appellant and thereafter on

the same day conveys same rights back to the appellant by executing a deed of transfer.

Accordingly, when Ukkuwa conveyed his rights to the respondent by the deed of transfer in

September 1990, he did not have title to the copra hut as he had already conveyed his rights to

the appellant in 1981 by the deed of gift subject to his life interest. However, he regained the title

no sooner he revoked the deed of gift in December 1990 but could he have conveyed the same

rights to the appellant by the deed of transfer executed the same day? Did not the rights he

gained through the revocation of the gift pass on to the respondent, immediately? The deed of

transfer through which Ukkuwa transferred his rights to the respondent in September 1990 (deed

5326-P9) had been properly registered in the folio 285 of volume 288, which was produced

marked P1(iv). Did the respondent gain title to the copra hut by operation of law – the maxim

exceptio rei venditae et traditae?

Claims to title based on the legal maxim exceptio rei venditae et traditae is recognised under the

Roman Dutch law and the jurisprudence developed over the years describe the manner in which

it is applicable in Sri Lanka under the common law.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

In Perera v Perera 62 NLR 5 Privy Council held that under the said doctrine, the title passes to

a vendee at the first moment of acquisition of title by vendor who did not have the right to

alienate any rights at the time of alienation.

Privy Council, in Gunatilake v Fernando 22 NLR 385 at 390 recognising the applicability of

the said doctrine further elaborated that,

“Under this exception the purchaser who had got possession from a vendor, who at the

time had no title, could rely upon a title subsequently acquired by the by the vendor, not

only against the vendor, but anyone claiming under the vendor; and though delivery

(traditio) was, as the title shows a part of the defence, if the purchaser has acquired

possession without force or fraud, he could use the exception, though he had never

received actual delivery from the vendor”.

The Privy Council in the same judgement cited with approval the following observations of the

Chief Justice in the Supreme Court Decision:

“….Traditio whether actual or symbolic, is no longer necessary for the consummation of

a sale of immovable property, and has been replaced by the delivery of the deed. See

Appuhamy v Appuhamy 3 S.C.C. 61, where the whole subject is lucidly explained. The

same protection, therefore, which the Roman law gave to a person who had completed

his title by possession, our own law will give to a person who had completed his title by

securing the delivery of a deed” (supra at 391).

However, the Supreme Court, in Siyadoris v Peter Singho 54 NLR 393 at 394 in deciding the

applicability of this maxim held that,

“It is self-evident that this exception, which is an equitable plea, cannot be set up by a

party who relies on a pretended sale, where there was in reality no consideration and

there was no transfer of possession of the property alleged to be sold or delivery of the

deed”

In Ponnambalam v Balasubramanium and others [2004] BLR 125 the Supreme Court held

that this legal maxim cannot be invoked when there is no delivery or possession and absence of

consideration.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

I will now proceed to examine the facts of the case under consideration to determine whether the

respondent can succeed in invoking the maxim and claim title against the appellant.

The deed 5326 (P9), the deed through which the respondent claims title to the copra hut, was

produced in court by the respondent. According to the attestation in the said deed, no

consideration had passed at the time of executing the deed. It is also pertinent to note that no

other evidence was presented in court that consideration had passed either prior or subsequent to

the execution of the deed. Hence an issue arises as to whether the transfer by Ukkuwa to the

respondent by deed 5326 (P9) is an ‘actual transfer’ or a ‘pretended sale’?

However, no point of contest had been raised before the District Court focusing on this issue. On

the strength of the evidence presented in court, following facts can be established. Within three

months of the execution of the aforementioned deed, Ukkuwa proceeds to revoke the deed of gift

through which he had already transferred his rights to the appellant in 1981, and immediately

thereafter, executed a deed of transfer in favour of the appellant again transferring all rights to

the land and all buildings excluding the rights to the two shop premises. The respondent in his

evidence admits that it is the appellant who is in possession of the copra hut. He does not claim

that he had possession at any stage. However, in my view these items of evidence are insufficient

to conclude whether or not the respondent could successfully invoke the maxim exceptio rei

venditae et traditae to his benefit.

When all these matters are taken into account, in my view there is a dearth of evidence for the

court to decide whether the legal maxim exceptio rei venditae et traditae could be invoked to the

benefit of the respondent in these proceedings.

As already observed the issue whether the respondent’s claim could be substantiated with the

benefit of the legal maxim under consideration has not ben raised at the trial court. If this aspect

had been properly raised and a point of contest was framed, all parties would have had the

opportunity to present evidence in this regard. If it had been raised it would have crystalised the

issue and the required evidence could have been presented. However, neither party took the

opportunity when no point of contest was raised. In my view the available evidence is

insufficient to reach a finding in favour of the respondent in this regard.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

17

When all these facts are taken together, I am of the view that the respondent cannot successfully

invoke the maxim exceptio rei venditae et traditae to his benefit. The transfer of rights by

Ukkuwa through deed 1588 (2V7) to the appellant prevails. Therefore, all rights of Ukkuwa to

the copra hut vests with the appellant. Hence, rights of Silindu – as discussed hereinbefore – as

well as rights of Ukkuwa, in relation to the copra hut, had been passed to the appellant and

therefore he is entitled to all shares relating to the copra hut.

In view of these findings I answer the question no. (ii), on which leave was granted, in the

affirmative.

Accordingly, based on my findings on questions (i) and (ii), I proceed to answer question

number (iii), on which leave was granted, also in the affirmative.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed and I set aside the judgement of the learned Civil Appellate

High Court dated 01 September 2016. The Judgement of the District Court dated 20th February

2015 is varied to the extent described herein below:

Allocation of Shares to the plaintiff (respondent) and second defendant (appellant):

Plaintiff – 1/4th share of the two boutique premises and soil underneath

Second Defendant – Undivided share of 87/216,

1/2th share of two boutique premises and soil underneath

All shares of copra hut and soil underneath

Shares unallocated - 1/4th share of two boutique premises and soil underneath

Points of Contest:

Point of contest no. 7 is answered as follows :

One of the two boutique premises and the soil underneath had been conveyed to the plaintiff and

Somawathie.

SC APPEAL 117/2017

18

Point of contest no. 23 is answered as follows:

Ukkuwa’s rights other than his rights to the two boutique premises had been transferred to the

second defendant.

The Appeal is allowed. The Judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court is set aside and the

judgment of the District Court is varied.
