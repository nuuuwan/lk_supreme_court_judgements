RESPONDENT - RESPONDENTS

Before: P. PADMAN SURASENA J

ACHALA WENGAPPULI J

MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA J

Counsel: Ranjan Suwandaratne PC with Anil Rajakaruna for the Petitioner-Appellant.

Vikum de Abrew PC, ASG for the 1st to 5th and 7th Respondent-Respondents.

Jagath Nanayakkara for the 6th Respondent-Respondent.

Argued on: 26-11-2021

Decided on: 10-11-2022

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner-Appellant claims that he is the occupant of the state land in extent of 02

Acres and 2 Roods, bearing No. in 217B, situated in Neelapola Grama Niladari Division of

Serunuwara Divisional Secretariat Division in Trincomalee District. Admittedly, he is an

unauthorized occupant of the aforementioned state land. According to him, upon

applications made by such unauthorized occupants, it is customary for the state

authorities in Serunuwara area to regularize such unauthorized occupations by granting

permits to such unauthorized occupants under the Land Development Ordinance. He

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 5 of 15 states that this is to enable such unauthorized occupants to continue occupation of such

state lands.

According to the Petitioner-Appellant, he had come into the occupation of the said state

land in 1995/1996 and has started cultivating in the same. It was the position of the

Petitioner-Appellant that the 6th Respondent-Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the

6th Respondent) had attempted to disturb his possession of this land in the year 2003 on

the basis that her father (the 6th Respondent’s father) was the original permit holder of

the land. The Petitioner-Appellant states that he had thereafter written the letter dated

21st May 2003 produced marked P 1 to the District Secretary (the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent), requesting him to resolve the dispute.

The Petitioner-Appellant had also lodged the complaint dated 03rd June 2003 in

Serunuwara police relating to the aforementioned dispute. He has produced a copy of

the said complaint to Police, marked P 2.

Subsequently, on 09th June 2003 the Petitioner-Appellant had met the Commissioner

General of Lands (the 4th Respondent-Respondent), seeking to resolve the dispute. In

this regard, the Commissioner General of Lands, by letter dated 09th June 2003 produced

marked P 3, had called from the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) (the 3rd

Respondent-Respondent), the report of the inquiry held by him in relation to this dispute.

The contents of this letter shows that it had pre-supposed that an inquiry had already

been held by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) by this time.

The Petitioner-Appellant had further stated that he was compelled to make further

representation to the Divisional Secretary Serunuwara (the 1st Respondent-Respondent),

as the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee), had failed to hold an inquiry

according to the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance; i.e., the failure of the

Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) to prepare and submit a report in relation

to the above dispute to the Commissioner of Lands, as per the instructions in the letter

dated 9th June 2003 (P 3).

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 6 of 15 Following the representation made by the Petitioner-Appellant, the Divisional Secretary

Serunuwara by letter dated 06th August 2003 produced marked P 4, had brought to the

notice of the District Secretary of Trincomalee, the complaint made by the Petitioner-

Appellant who had alleged that the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) had

caused him an injustice in the inquiries conducted up to that time.

In the meantime, Serunuwara Police acting on the complaint dated 10th June 2003 made

by the Petitioner-Appellant, had filed the report dated 20th June 2003 (produced marked

P 6) in Muthur Magistrate’s Court under section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act

No. 44 of 1979. The Petitioner-Appellant states1 that the Primary court had upheld the

fact that he is in possession of that land, in that proceedings. He had produced the

relevant Primary Court order dated 11th September 2003 [P 6(a)] which is in Tamil

language.2

Thereafter, the Commissioner General of Lands, by the letter dated 2nd October 20033

produced marked P-5, had reminded and again requested the Assistant Commissioner

of Lands (Trincomalee) to submit a report setting out answers to the two queries made

in the said letter. The said queries were whether a permit has been issued to the 6th

Respondent and whether the Petitioner-Appellant was in possession of the disputed land.

The letter P 5 is a reminder to the letter P 3.

The Petitioner-Appellant states that he thereafter (after the Magistrate’s court upheld his

possession), requested the Divisional Secretary by the letter dated 11th February 2004

(produced marked P 7), to issue him a permit for the disputed land. The Divisional

Secretary thereafter by letter dated 13th February 2004 (produced marked P 8), had

forwarded the said request to the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee).

The Petitioner-Appellant further states that although an inquiry was thereafter conducted

by two officers as advised by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee), the

1 Petition dated 6th November 2009 filed in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 17 & 18. 2 No translation has been provided. 3 The date of the said letter is as per the Petition dated 6th November 2009 filed in the Court of Appeal. The letter marked P 5 only indicates that the same was issued in October 2003.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 7 of 15 said inquiry was not conducted impartially. Accordingly, the Petitioner-Appellant by letters

dated 21st July 2004 and 28th July 2004 marked P 9 and P 10 respectively informed the

District Secretary of Trincomalee, about the conduct of the said officers and requested

him to take necessary action in that regard. In addition to the aforementioned letters,

the Petitioner-Appellant had also filed a complaint dated 15th July 2004 in the Serunuwara

police station regarding the same. This has been produced marked P 11.

Thereafter, upon a request made by the Petitioner-Appellant, the District Secretary of

Trincomalee, by letter dated 02nd August 2004 produced marked P 12, had advised the

Commissioner of Lands to hold a fresh inquiry with different officials. The inquiry report

dated 23rd July 2004 is the report pertaining to the alleged partial inquiry referred to in

the letter P 12.

The 3rd Respondent-Respondent, the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee)

(Hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd Respondent) has admitted the letter P 12.4

The 3rd Respondent has produced that report (dated 23rd July 2004) marked 3R 2. This

shows that the District Secretary of Trincomalee (2nd Respondent-Respondent), had not

accepted the inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004 which had recommended granting of

the permit relating to the disputed land to the 6th Respondent.

The Petitioner-Appellant states that he had also made a formal application to issue the

permit under his name by relying on the Magistrate’s Court order. The Petitioner-

Appellant has produced the said formal application, marked P 13. In the meantime, the

Petitioner has also made several requests to the Respondents requesting for the permit

to be issued to him. The said request letters have been produced marked P14, P15,

P16, P17, P18.

On or about 6th March 2009, the Petitioner-Appellant had received summons (P 19) as

the 6th Respondent had instituted the action bearing No. 2373/2009 in the District Court

of Trincomalee. The 6th Respondent had instituted the said action relying on a permit

4The affidavit dated 11th November 2019 filed by the 3rd Respondent in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 16.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 8 of 15 issued in her name for the same land under the Land Development Ordinance. The said

permit has been produced marked P 21.

It is the position of the Petitioner-Appellant that he was neither informed nor aware of

holding of any inquiry before the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) had

prepared the inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004 (3R 2).5

It was in the above circumstances that the Petitioner-Appellant had filed the instant writ

application in the Court of Appeal against the Respondent- Respondents praying inter alia

for:

i. a writ of certiorari to quash the permit issued to the 6th Respondent,

ii. a writ of mandamus against the 1st to 5th Respondent-Respondents to compel

them to take steps to rectify the erroneously issued permit and to restore his

rights and privileges.

The grounds upon which the Petitioner-Appellant had filed the instant writ application in

the Court of Appeal can be gathered by paragraph 37 of the petition dated 06th November

2009 filed in the Court of Appeal. According to the said paragraph 37 of the petition

dated 06th November 2009, the Petitioner-Appellant had complained to the Court of

Appeal that the permit of the 6th Respondent has been issued contrary to law, is ultra

vires, and is voidable. The followings can be taken as the summary of the complaint to

the Court of Appeal.

i. The said permit has been issued violating the principles of natural justice and in

violation of the principle of Audi Alteram Partem

ii. The Respondents have no legal basis to arrive at such a recommendation to grant

a permit to the 6th Respondent in view of the long term possession by the

Petitioner of the said land.

5 The affidavit dated 06th November 2008 filed by the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 25.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 9 of 15

iii. The Petitioner who made numerous requests to obtain a permit, had not been

given any notice of any inquiry prior to the recommendation on 30th October 2006

and in any event prior to the permit was issued.

iv. The Respondents have abused the powers vested in them and come to

conclusions acting with bias and ulterior motives.

v. In any event the Respondents have not considered that the 6th Respondent

cannot rely on the succession of a permit which has been issued to any other

person not being in possession for over 13 years.

vi. The said permit as well as the recommendation clearly violate the legitimate

expectation of the Petitioner to obtain a permit of the land of which he had been

in possession for over 13 years.

vii. The said decisions clearly violate the legal rights and legitimate expectations,

benefits and rights of the Petitioner under the Land Development Ordinance to

enjoy the continuous occupation and cultivation of the land under a permit that

should be issued to him.

viii. The said permit was issued to the 6th Respondent by error and on the false

representations of the 6th Respondent.

After concluding the argument of the case, the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal had

pronounced the judgment dated 05th July 2013 holding inter alia that the Petitioner-

Appellant did not have a valid permit; the Petitioner-Appellant's long term unauthorized

possession does not entitle him a permit in his name; the Petitioner-Appellant had

deliberately refused to participate in the inquiry stating his reasons to the Assistant

Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) on 23rd February 2003 which he had recorded in

the document he had produced marked 3 R1 in the Court of Appeal. It was due to the

above reasons that the Court of Appeal had dismissed the application of the Petitioner-

Appellant.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 10 of 15 Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Petitioner-Appellant had

sought Special Leave to Appeal against the judgment. The Supreme Court, upon hearing

the learned counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

by its order dated 22nd September 2014, had granted Special Leave to Appeal on the

following two questions of law (verbatim):

a. Have Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal totally failed to consider the fact that

the Respondents have failed to hold a proper and due inquiry in relation to the

application made by the Petitioner to obtain a permit in order to regularize his

possession of the property which he was cultivating for an extremely long period

of time.

b. Have their Lordships of the Court of Appeal failed to consider the fact that the final

inquiry dated 23rd July, 2004 has not been informed to the Petitioner nor he was

provided an opportunity to place his facts at the inquiry in arriving at their final

conclusion?

A closer look at the above questions of law shows that they would finally rest on the

question whether the Petitioner was provided an opportunity to participate in the inquiry

before arriving at the final conclusion. Thus, I would first focus on the above question

and it would be convenient to focus more on the question of law set out in (b) above for

that purpose.

Let me commence with the position of the Petitioner-Appellant with regard to the question

of law set out in (b) above. It is the position of the Petitioner-Appellant that he was

unaware of the date fixed for the inquiry which had taken place on 23rd July 2004

Moreover, it is his position that he was not provided with an opportunity to be heard since

the Respondent had not informed him the date fixed for the inquiry. According to the

Petitioner-Appellant he had neither received any notice nor received any reports or

decisions concluded during the said inquiry. The Petitioner-Appellant further claims that

it was the influence of the 6th Respondent which led the Respondents not to provide him

an opportunity to present his case and that influence resulted in the relevant permit

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 11 of 15 being issued to the 6th Respondent despite the continuous occupation of the land by him

for a long time.

Let me at this stage turn to the position taken up by the 3rd Respondent in relation to the

Petitioner-Appellant’s complaint. Nowhere in his affidavit, the 3rd Respondent has

asserted that he had taken any step to notify the Petitioner- Appellant about the holding

of an inquiry. Leaving alone informing the Petitioner-Appellant about the date fixed for

the inquiry, the 3rd Respondent in his affidavit has not even mentioned as to when this

purported inquiry was conducted. Moreover, the 3rd Respondent has neither produced

nor relied on any document/material to convince Court that he had taken any step to

notify the Petitioner-Appellant about the holding of an inquiry before the inquiring officer

prepared his report dated 23rd July 2004.

In the above circumstances, it is not difficult for me to conclude that no state authority

has either taken any step to inform the Petitioner-Appellant, the date fixed for the inquiry

or to provide him an opportunity to present his case before deciding to grant the relevant

permit to the 6th Respondent despite the Petitioner-Appellant’s complaint that he has

been in long term possession of the land.

By the letter dated 06th August 2004 marked 3 R3, it is clear that the Commissioner of

Lands had directed the Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee) to take steps to

issue a permit to the 6th Respondent acting on the inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004 (3

R2). Although the 3rd Respondent-Respondent has admitted the letter P 12 (the letter

by the District Secretary advising the Commissioner of Lands to hold a fresh inquiry with

different officials), he has not even attempted to explain whether any action was taken

in that regard. It is relevant to note that the letter dated 06th August 2004 marked 3 R3,

deciding to issue a permit to the 6th Respondent had been issued just 03 days after the

letter P 12. Thus, it is clear that the request to conduct an inquiry through an independent

official could not have been done before deciding to issue the impugned permit to the 6th

Respondent by the letter dated 06th August 2004 marked 3 R3.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 12 of 15 The document marked 3 R2, the inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004 submitted by Mr. D.

M. N. Dissanayake, Assistant Commissioner of Lands (Trincomalee), seeks to assert that

the Petitioner-Appellant had deliberately defaulted appearing in the inquiry and that led

to the issuance of the permit to the 6th Respondent. The Assistant Commissioner Lands-

Trincomalee in the same report has also adverted to the fact that the Petitioner-Appellant,

even previously had behaved in a similar manner.6

If that was the case, the question arises as to why the Assistant Commissioner Lands-

Trincomalee did not think it was prudent to send a written notice to inform the Petitioner-

Appellant, the date fixed for the inquiry or to provide him an opportunity to present his

case before deciding to grant the relevant permit to the 6th Respondent. The Assistant

Commissioner Lands-Trincomalee had not done so.

Moreover, the 3rd Respondent seems to have relied only upon the document marked 3R

2, which is the very document challenged by the Petitioner-Appellant. The 3rd Respondent

has not been able to produce any other independent document to convince Court that he

had taken all possible steps to comply with the Rules of Natural Justice.

It must to be noted that the Land Development Ordinance has set out the procedure to

be followed when granting permits to the State Lands. Similarly, the said Ordinance has

set out detailed procedure as to how a person could succeed to a land in respect of which

a previous permit has already been granted to another. Moreover, the said Ordinance

has also set out the procedure to be followed when the State wants to cancel such

permits. For instance, section 106 of the ordinance requires the Government authority to

issue a notice in the prescribed form asking the permit holder to show cause why his

permit should not be cancelled. Section 107 of the Ordinance states that the date

specified in such notice shall not be less than 30 days from the date of the issue of such

notice. Additionally, section 108 of the Ordinance requires that a copy of such notice to

be affixed in a conspicuous position on the relevant land. Such are the statutory

requirements set out in the Ordinance designed as safeguards to uphold the principals of

6 Report dated 23rd July 2004 marked 3 R2 in paragraph 4.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 13 of 15 Natural Justice in those circumstances. Thus, the State officials, although the instant

situation is different from those described above, cannot and should not deviate from

giving sufficient notice at least to the rival party who will be directly affected by the

decision to be taken. This is nothing but compliance of rules of Natural Justice in its

simplest form.

The inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004 (3R 2) does not set out a specific legal provision

under which the inquiring officer and the other state officers had acted when they had

decided to grant the permit to the 6th Respondent. While the 3rd Respondent does not

take up the position that the permit to the 6th Respondent was issued subsequent to a

holding of a land kachcheri in terms of chapter III of the Ordinance, he also does not say

that the 6th Respondent has succeeded to the land in terms of chapter VII of the

Ordinance.

The Respondents have denied that they are aware of any customary practice in

Serunuwara area to grant permits under the Land Development Ordinance to

unauthorized occupants, upon applications made by them to regularize their illegal

occupation of state lands.7 If that is the stated position of the Respondents, then they

are obliged to satisfy Court how and under what provision of law they have taken steps

to issue a permit to the 6th Respondent. The Respondents maintain silence on this issue.

Despite the above denial by the Respondents, it is an admitted fact by the Respondent

that an inquiry was held. Although the Respondents have stated in their objections that

they are bound by the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, the provision under

which they held this inquiry is only known to them. Be that as it may, whatever the nature

of the inquiry the Respondents had conducted, that inquiry had decided that the

Petitioner-Appellant is not entitled to a permit under the Land Development Ordinance.

Thus, it can reasonably be inferred that the 3rd Respondent has held this inquiry as per

the said practice adverted to above, by the Petitioner-Appellant. In such an event, I am

7 The affidavit dated 11th February 2011 filed by the 3rd Respondent in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 8; The statement of objections dated 11th February 2011 filed by the 1st -5th Respondents in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 6.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 14 of 15 unable to accept that there is no obligation on the part of the Government officers dealing

with the property rights of the citizens to give due notice of such inquiries to all the parties

concerned. This is more so because upholding the rule Audi Alteram Partem is seen

permeating throughout the Land Development Ordinance from its inception.

Let me now turn to the Judgment of the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal had gone on the basis that the Petitioner had refused to participate

at the inquiry and conducted himself in an unacceptable manner. Thus, the Court of

Appeal appears to have placed the full reliance on the inquiry report dated 23rd July 2004

(3 R2). As that is the document the Petitioner-Appellant had sought to impugn in this

very application, I am of the view that it is not correct for the Court of Appeal to have

relied upon the very impugned document to conclude that the Petitioner-Appellant had

refused to participate at the inquiry. Moreover, the Court of Appeal has only focused in

its judgment, the argument that the Petitioner-Appellant is not entitled to a permit on his

claim of long-term possession. This is besides the Petitioner- Appellant urging the breach

of the rule Audi Alteram Partem, as his first ground for the issuance of a writ of certiorari.8

The Court of Appeal in its judgement has not considered at all, the question whether the

Petitioner-Appellant was given notice of the inquiry held on 23rd July 2004 to enable him

to place his facts before the inquiring officer. Thus, I have to answer the question of law

set out in (b) above in the affirmative and in favour of the Petitioner-Appellant. As

mentioned above, considering the fact that the case of the Petitioner- Appellant finally

would finally rest on the question whether the Petitioner was provided an opportunity to

participate in the inquiry before arriving at the final conclusion, I find that answering the

same is sufficient to dispose the instant application. Thus, I would not endeavor to

consider the question of law (a).

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment dated 05th July 2013 of the Court of

Appeal. I hold that the Respondents have breached the rules of Natural Justice namely

the rule Audi Alteram Partem when deciding to grant the permit to the 6th Respondent.

8 Petition dated 6th November 2009 filed in the Court of Appeal in paragraph 37.

[SC APPEAL 169/2014] Page 15 of 15 This has rendered the said decision and all subsequent actions relying on that decision

null and void. In those circumstances, I proceed to issue a writ of certiorari quashing the

permit issued to the 6th Respondent produced marked P 21. I direct the 1st-5th

Respondent-Respondents to hold a proper inquiry according to law, after giving due

written notice to all the parties concerned and arrive at an appropriate conclusion with

regard to the granting of the permit to the relevant land. The fresh inquiry must be

conducted by an independent officer other than those involved at any step in the previous

process. Appeal is allowed.

The Petitioner-Appellant is entitled to the costs of litigation in both Courts.
