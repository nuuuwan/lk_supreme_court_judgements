DECIDED ON : 9th June 2022

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

Manimel Dura Malik Sachinthana (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

“Petitioner”) sat the General Certificate of Education Examination (Advanced Level) in

August 2018 (as his second attempt to enter University) and applied to be admitted to

a Faculty of Law.

The 1st Respondent is the University Grants Commission (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the UGC) which is a body Corporate established under the Universities

Act, No. 16 of 1978. The 2nd Respondent is the Chairman of the 1st Respondent.

The 3rd Respondent is the Director of the Advanced Technological Institute

(hereinafter referred to as ATI), the institute under which the Petitioner has allegedly

been registered for a three-year course of study to obtain a Higher National Diploma.

The 4th Respondent is the Director General of the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced

Technological Education (hereinafter referred to as SLIATE) established under Act No.

29 of 1995.

This matter was supported on 10/02/2020 before this Court and leave was

granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution against 1st - 4th Respondents. The 1st -

4th Respondents are alleged to have directly violated the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioner.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 13

The Facts

The Petitioner states that he sat for the General Certificate of Education,

Advanced Level (hereinafter referred to as GCE A/L) Examination in August 2018, from

the Hambantota District in the Arts Stream and obtained ‘A’ passes (Distinction passes)

in all three subjects. In order of merit, he was placed 4th in the Hambantota district and

90th all Island, securing a Z-score of 2.1652.

The minimum Z-score required to be admitted to the Faculty of Law of the

University of Colombo for the academic year 2018/2019 was 1.9574, as such the

Petitioner was eligible to be admitted to the University. Accordingly, the Petitioner

states that he made an application to the 1st Respondent to enter the Faculty of Law

of the University of Colombo, Peradeniya or Jaffna as he was keen on becoming a

lawyer.

However, the 1st Respondent had rejected the Petitioner’s application to enter

a Faculty of Law. The reason being that the Petitioner had registered for a three-year

course of study to obtain a Higher National Diploma in Technology and Hospitality

under Part 1, paragraph 1.7(6)(a) of the Handbook issued by the 1st Respondent with

regard to admissions to universities for the academic year 2018/2019 based on the

results of the GCE A/L examination held in 2018. However, in the normal circumstances

he would have gotten a definite placement at the Faculty of Law of the University of

Colombo.

However, the Petitioner states that there is no evidential proof that the

Petitioner was a properly registered student of the ATI, Galle. Using his results obtained

at the GCE A/L examination in August 2016 (first attempt), the Petitioner sat the

entrance examination to be admitted as a student of the ATI, Galle. Although he was

successful in the examination, he states that he never registered as a student as he did

not submit the mandatory documents, including his school leaving certificate.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 13

Nevertheless, as it was submitted by the Petitioner that the ATI has included the

Petitioner’s name as a prospective student of the institute. On further investigation it

had been revealed by the Officials of the ATI that due to a mistake of their clerical staff

the Petitioner’s name had not been removed from their computer system, whereas his

name had in fact been removed from their books and they had admitted another

student in his place. As per the submitted documents and evidence before this Court

it was revealed that the Petitioner, though successful at the entrance examination,

never registered himself or attended any lectures.

Accordingly, the Petitioner on 11/02/2022 requested the officials of ATI to

inform the 1st Respondent UGC, that he was not a registered student of ATI at any

time. However, the Petitioner states that ATI, erroneously by a letter dated 11/02/2019

(document marked "X5”/ “2R5”) informed the 2nd Respondent Chairman of UGC, that

the Petitioner had been registered for a Diploma with the said Institute on 08/05/2018

and that by his own request on 11/02/2019 ceased to follow the diploma any further.

Then, by a letter dated 13/02/2019 (the document marked “X6”/ “2R7”)

addressed to 2nd Respondent, sent by ATI it had been stated that the Petitioner had

been registered for a Higher National Diploma Program on Tourism and Hospitality

Management with the said Institute on 08/05/2018 and from the initial stage he had

not attended any lectures and that by his own request on 02/07/2018 ceased to follow

the diploma any further.

By the document marked “X7A”, a letter dated 25/02/2019 addressed to 4th

Respondent Director General of Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological

Education (SLIATE), sent by the 1st Respondent UGC, sought clarifications as to the

contradictory statements said in aforementioned letters and the delay in supply of

requested information regarding the Petitioner.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 13

A letter dated 27/02/2019 (document marked "X7"/ “2R10”) addressed to

Director General of SLIATE sent by ATI, furthered to clarify the document marked "X6"

the letter dated 13/02/2019 (which stated that the Petitioner had willingly withdrawn

from the course on 02/07/2018), stating that it was sent so that the Petitioner may be

eligible to enter a University, satisfying the requirement that he had ceased registration

60 days prior to the last date of registration, so as not to hinder the Petitioner’s future.

A letter dated 11/04/2019 (document marked "X8") addressed to SLIATE sent

by the Petitioner made an appeal to the 4th Respondent, Director General of SLIATE,

requesting that correct facts be informed to the 1st Respondent, UGC.

A letter dated 10/04/2019 (document marked "X9"/ “2R11”) addressed to 2nd

Respondent, Chairman of UGC sent by 4th Respondent, Director General of SLIATE

clarified the true position as to the erroneous misconception which has taken place.

Thereafter, the Petitioner started to visit the officers of the UGC, and to request

them to reconsider his position and to admit him to the Law Faculty of the University

of Colombo. However, he was turned down by the authoritative administrative bodies,

informing him that once a decision is taken that a student is disqualified to be admitted

to a University, it cannot be changed thereafter, and that it had never been done.

The Petitioner states in view of the letter dated 10/04/2019 (document marked

"X9") together with the letter dated 13/02/2019 (document marked “X6"), that the

purporting cancellation of the erroneous registration was done on 02/07/2018 within

the time frame of 60 days; thus, the Petitioner is qualified to be admitted to a

University, according to the Handbook issued by the 1st Respondent UGC (which the

relevant pages were marked as "X10”).

Further, it is clear by document marked “X11” that, in instructions for

registration at ATI, it is mandatory that the school Leaving Certificate be forwarded for

the due registration process to be admitted as a student at the Institute.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 13

The Petitioner states that after much difficulty, the Petitioner and his father were

able to meet the 2nd Respondent himself on the 05/07/2019, who holds the position

of Chairman of the 1st Respondent. At the conclusion of the meeting, the 2nd

Respondent being the head of the 1st Respondent incorporated body, had verbally

informed the Petitioner that the aforesaid decision of the 1st Respondent, UGC refusing

to admit the Petitioner to a University is final and that it cannot be changed.

Variances in facts as per the Respondents

The 2nd Respondent to this application (Chairman of the UGC) admitted that the

Petitioner sat for the GCE A/L examination in 2018 from the Hambantota District in the

Arts Stream, securing ‘A’ passes in all three subjects, as he states the Petitioner

obtained a Z score of 2.1647 and was ranked No.91 in the Island (no evidential proof

was provided).

Further, he admitted the fact that the Petitioner submitted his application to

the 1st Respondent to gain admission to the Faculty of Law of the University of

Colombo. However, he stated that the said application contained incorrect information

that the Petitioner was not a registered student at the ATI, Galle. Therefore, he was

ineligible to be admitted to the Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo, hence his

application was rejected. He admits only the receipt of the documents marked “X5, X6,

X7”. Further, the 2nd Respondent admits that the Petitioner had met his predecessor.

He further states that the Petitioner's name was included as No. 267 in the list

of registered students (marked “2R3”) which was sent via email by the 3rd Respondent

on 04/06/2018 to the 1st Respondent. The list states that the last date for registration

for the said Diploma programme was 20/07/2018.

The 3rd Respondent, Director of ATI and the 4th Respondent, the Director

General of SLIATE stated that the Petitioner was a student of the ATI and that he was

well aware that he had been properly registered as a student at the ATI till 11/02/2019.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 13

Hence, he is not entitled to apply for any other University which comes under the UGC.

They further admit that the Petitioner was absent from lectures and that he did not

follow the aforesaid programme.

Thus, the 1st - 4th Respondents all state that the Petitioner was a registered

student of the ATI, Galle.

Infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

Article 12(1) of the Constitution ensures that individuals despite their status in

a given circumstance are entitled to equal treatment and equal protection guaranteed

by the law. In this context, it is the duty of the executive body, the University Grants

Commission, a body corporate established under the University Act, No. 16 of 1978 to

intake students each year to the Universities established under the said Act based on

the Z-scores obtained by students sitting the GCE A/L examination held each year.

In the instant case, the Petitioner had obtained a Z-score of 2.1652 which is well

above the required Z-score of 1.9574 to enter the Faculty of Law at the University of

Colombo (as provided in document marked “X1a”).

As per the documents provided by the Petitioner, it is evident that the Petitioner

was not a validly registered student of the ATI, Galle. As per the letter dated

10/04/2019 marked “2R11” and the letter dated 13/03/2020 marked “2R13”, SLIATE

admits that, although the Petitioner was successful at the entrance examination to ATI,

he had not submitted his school leaving certificate. It is by the mistake of the officials

of ATI that the Petitioner has been included as a ‘prospective’ student of ATI (as seen

in the document marked “2R3”) and they have no objections against the Petitioner

being admitted to University. Further, as stated by the Petitioner, his name has been

removed from the records of the Institute and another student has been admitted in

his place. The same has not been challenged by the Respondents.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 13

Therefore, ATI has not followed a valid registration process in admitting the

Petitioner as a student of their Institute as the required mandatory documents had not

been submitted by the Petitioner. As per the guidelines to be admitted to ATI, the

Petitioner must have submitted his school leaving certificate, which he did not submit

as he had used it to apply for University admission. Furthermore, in the letter of the

Petitioner dated 11/04/2019 (document marked “X8”) he has stated that although he

was successful at the entrance examination, he had not attended any lectures, used

any library facilities or received the Mahapola scholarship. He had not been asked to

attend any lectures nor was he informed of his registration at the Institute or received

any documents relating to that. Thus, it is valid for the Petitioner to assume that his

registration at ATI was not successful.

As per the clarification letter sent by the ATI on the request of the UGC (marked

“2R10”), as the Petitioner had not attended any lectures, so as not to hinder the

Petitioner’s future, ATI admits that Petitioner has withdrawn from the said Diploma

within the stipulated period of 60 days.

Therefore, under normal circumstances it is clear that the Petitioner would

definitely be eligible to be admitted to the Faculty of Law at the University of Colombo.

As the UGC handbook provides that if a student withdraws their registration 60 days

prior to the last date of registration, the student is allowed to enter University based

on the results of his second attempt at the GCE A/L Examination.

The court exercising equity jurisdiction can consider that the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation to enter the Faculty of Law as he had a sufficient Z-score.

Therefore, I find his Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12(1) violated and I am of

the opinion that the Petitioner should be given a placement in the next intake of

students for the Faculty of Law at the University of Colombo.

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 13

As per Justice Fernando, in the case of Surendran v The University Grants

Commission and Another (1993) 1 SLR 344,

“Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. And in the

field of higher education this requires that the system of University

admissions, both as formulated and as implemented, must not only be

fair but seen to be fair.”

Education in Sri Lanka has a long history that dates back two millennia. While

the Constitution of Sri Lanka does not provide free education as a fundamental right,

by Article 27(2) (h) of the 1978 Constitution under Chapter VI – Directive Principles

of State Policy (DPSP) the State is pledged to “the complete eradication of illiteracy and

the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all

levels”.

The right to education is illustrated by the formulation in Article 26 of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 26 (1) of the said Declaration states

that : “Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the

elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory.

Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher

education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit”.

Therefore, although there is no specific provision dealing with the right to

Education in our Constitution as such in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

the said right has been accepted and acknowledged by our Courts through the

provisions embodied in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In doing so, the Supreme

Court has not only considered that the Right to Education should be accepted as a

fundamental human right, but also had accepted the value of such Education, which

has been described by James A. Garfield (in his letter accepting the Republican

nomination to run for President on 12th July 1880), as, “next in importance to freedom

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 13

and justice is popular Education, without which neither freedom nor justice can be

permanently maintained.”

The establishment of the free education strategy in 1944 was a standard shift

in the history of the education system in Sri Lanka. This policy provided equal prospects

for all to accomplish access to the education system and formed a strong basis for

long term ecological development within the human capital of the country. A report

recently published by the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka even recognizes

education as a right rather than a privilege available to all citizens. Therefore, it must

be understood that education must stay equally and freely available to everyone as

per C.W.W. Kannangara’s long term vision.

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the UGC cannot arbitrarily deprive the

Petitioner of the opportunity to follow his higher education at a State funded

University as he is clearly eligible to be admitted as per the evidential documents

provided. As per the letters submitted by both ATI and SLIATE, they have no objections

in the Petitioner being admitted to a University. The Petitioner had not attended any

lectures nor did he return with his school leaving certificate to register himself as a

student at ATI.

Therefore, taking into consideration these factors I see no reason for the UGC

to disqualify the Petitioner’s application. Although it appears to be that the Petitioner

was a registered student under an Institute coming under the UGC, it is as admitted

by the Respondents, that the fault lies with the ATI.

The UGC as an Institution advocating free education must not deprive a student

of his future. In doing so it’s breaking down the very futures of the students it is trying

to build. Therefore, I do not see a reasonable explanation as to why the UGC should

reject the Petitioner’s application as the Petitioner is not a validly registered student of

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 13

ATI to start with. The critical need everywhere in the world is for education to prepare

students to lead successful, fulfilling lives.

As per Justice Sharvananda in Rienzie Perera v University Grants Commission

([1978-79-80] 1 SLR 128,

“Education is one of the most important functions of the State today. The

large expenditure of money incurred by the State for education signifies its

recognition of the importance of education to a democratic society. In these

days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed

in life if he is denied the opportunity of education. Such an opportunity,

where the State undertakes to provide it, is a right which must be made

available to all on equal terms. The Constitution enjoins the organs of

Government to secure and advance and not deny this fundamental right of

equality of treatment.”

As was mentioned by this bench, “Free Education is the only way to go up in

life”. Therefore, government institutions must ensure that they do not deprive students

of this opportunity.

Decision

Considering the facts of the case while I declare the Petitioner’s Fundamental

Rights enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution are violated, I direct the 1st and 2nd

Respondents to admit the Petitioner to the appropriate University that he would have

been eligible for as per the Z-score that he has obtained during the GCE A/L

Examination in August 2018 and be admitted to the next available intake with

immediate effect.

If this Petitioner had been admitted he would have completed 3 years of his 4-

year degree programme. Denial of admission by the UGC had caused not only the cost

SC /FR/311/2019 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 13

of litigation, but 3 years of his youth. Considering all, I impose a cost of Rs.500,000 be

paid to him within 6 months by the 1st Respondent.

Application allowed.
