Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ

SC FR Applications 304/2016, 204/2016 and 205/2016 were taken up together with the

agreement of the parties as the impugned conduct in all these applications is the same. Counsel

made submissions focusing on SC FR 304/2016 and all parties in all three connected matters

agreed to abide by the Judgement delivered in SC FR 304/2016.

In SC FR 304/2016, seventy-eight Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under

Article 126 of the Constitution. All of them are accountants by profession and are employees of

the Ceylon Electricity Board (hereinafter also referred to as CEB). They are members of the

‘Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants’ Association’. The Petitioners had been holding different

positions at senior executive category within the Accounts and Audit Service of the Ceylon

Electricity Board, at the time they invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126 of the

Constitution. They hold different positions with different classes, grades and salary scales. Such

classes, grades and salary scales are, namely; Class I Special at K Special salary scale, Class I at

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

18

K1 salary scale, Class II Grade 1 at K2 salary scale, Class II Grade II at K3 salary scale and

Class II Grade II at K4 salary scale.

The Petitioners contended that the criteria for the appointment and recruitment, and the

promotion of employees of the CEB at Senior Executive Level are regulated by the General

Manager’s Circular No 2002/GM/32(1)/Policy titled “Schemes of Recruitment and Promotions

For Senior Executive Categories”. Petitioners contended that the aforesaid scheme was

applicable to employees from key categories of employment including, the Engineering Service,

Human Resources Service and Ancillary Services. They contend that all employees at Senior

Executive Level at the CEB are placed at different salary scales depending on the class and the

grade they are at within a single salary structure namely “K structure” irrespective of the specific

service they belong to. In other words, under the scheme in place no distinction is made on the

basis of the specific service they belong to when they are holding positions at the same class and

grade within the stipulated salary scale.

The Petitioners further contended, that they entertained a legitimate expectation to be placed

within a common salary structure irrespective of the Service they belong to. It is their

contention, that the creation of a distinct salary scale named “E-salary scale” and a “Unified

Engineering Service” applicable only to Engineers who are working at the Senior Executive

Grades in the CEB is violative of their Right to equality guaranteed under Article 12(1) and

Freedom of occupation guaranteed under Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The 13th Respondent in this matter is the President of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineer’s

Union. The CEB is cited as the 3rd Respondent and the 4th Respondent is the Chairman of the

CEB. Objections to the Petitioner’s application were filed by way of affidavits of the 4th and 13th

Respondents. They contended, that the Petitioners have failed to establish any violation of their

rights and furthermore, the acts of none of the Respondents have violated the Fundamental

Rights of any of the Petitioners. It is their contention, inter alia, that there was no common

scheme of recruitment and promotion for employees from different services within the CEB.

However, they contend that employees from different services were placed within a common

salary scale called K-salary scale. They further contend that the creation of the Unified

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

19

Engineering Service and the E-salary scheme for the employees of the Unified Engineering

Service is a reasonable classification based on intelligible differentia.

Furthermore, the Respondents by way of a preliminary objection contend, that the application of

the Petitioners’ should be dismissed in limine as it is time-barred. Further they claim that the

Petitioners have failed to cite all necessary parties; they suppressed and / or misrepresented

material facts and the application is futile in view of the supervening events.

Of these objections I propose to consider the objection of time-bar, first.

It is the contention of the Petitioners, inter alia that their rights were violated due to:

‘the continuous payment of salaries to the engineers employed by the 3rd Respondent, under and

in terms of the impugned Circular No 2014/GM/46/Pers purportedly dated 27/11/2014’

(emphasis added).

According to the material placed before this Court, the Board of Directors of the 3rd Respondent

at the meeting held on 26 November 2014 has approved the creation of the Unified Engineering

Service with the E-Salary scale applicable to the said Service and thereafter on 27 November

2014, the General Manager of the 3rd Respondent was directed to issue necessary circular

instructions to give effect to the aforesaid decision of the Board of Directors. However, it was

only on 8th January 2015 the administration of the CEB informed its employees regarding the

creation of the unified service for engineers and the E-Salary Scale, for the first time. Thereafter,

the said circular had been first withdrawn and thereafter re-issued on the following day, namely

on the 09th January 2015. Petitioners contend that the salaries of all engineers, senior engineering

assistants and engineering assistants have been paid on the basis of the impugned circular, from

the month of January 2015.

It is pertinent to note that, it is after a period of nineteen months from the date on which the

Petitioners became aware of the impugned circular and the payment of salaries based on the said

circular did take place, for the first time; the Petitioners filed papers in the present application.

More particularly, it was on the 05th September 2016, that the Petitioners filed papers before this

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

20

Court in the present application. Hence, the Respondents’ contend that the petitioners’

application is time-barred. The other two connected matters namely SC FR 204/2016 and SC FR

205/2016 were filed on 17th June 2016 – two and half months prior to the application under

consideration.

The 13th Respondent at the first given opportunity pleaded in these proceedings that the

application is time barred and moved Court that the application be dismissed in limine. Limited

objections dated 14th September 2016, amended limited objections dated 20th September 2016

and the objections dated 24th November 2016 filed by the 13th Respondent do raise the issue of

time-bar as a preliminary objection. Limited objections filed on 1st September 2016 in SC FR

204/2016 and SC FR 205/2016 also raise time-bar as a preliminary objection.

Article 126(2) of the Constitution provides that an application on an alleged infringement or an

alleged imminent infringement of a fundamental right should be made to the Supreme Court

within one month from the date of the administrative or executive action due to which such

infringement is alleged to have taken place or alleged to be taking place. Jurisprudence of this

Court establishes that the time limit of one month set out in Article 126(2) is mandatory and non-

compliance with it would result in the dismissal of such application due to lack of jurisdiction to

entertain such delayed applications. However, this Court had, further recognised that an

extension of this mandatory one-month time period could be granted in certain circumstances.

One such circumstance is the situations in which the principle lex non cogit ad impossiblia can

be invoked due to the circumstances in a particular case. It is also pertinent to note that this Court

had accepted that the calculation of one-month period should begin not from the date of the

occurrence of the alleged infringement but from the day the petitioner becomes aware of the

alleged infringement. Furthermore, this Court had also recognize that the time period of one

month should be deemed to commence only after the Petitioners had a reasonable opportunity to

complete the preparatory work which was essential to formulate and file their application, in

applications which have been filed in public interest.

judges agreeing with him, cited with approval judgments of this Court1 and recognized the

aforementioned dicta applicable in relation to the issue of time-bar in the context of Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

It is common ground that the e-mails of 8th and 9th January 2015, conveyed the impugned

decision reached on 27th November 2014. The application under consideration has been filed in

this Court on 5th September 2016, well outside the one-month time period stipulated under

Article 126(2) of the Constitution. It is on this basis that the Respondents claim that this

application is time-barred. However, the Petitioners refute this contention. The Petitioners claim

that there is a ‘continuing violation’ of the Petitioners’ rights in this matter and each instance in

which salaries are paid to the members of the Unified Engineering Service, based on the

impugned decision, a violation of the Rights of the Petitioners occurs. They have pleaded “that

all engineers of the CEB have been paid their monthly salaries from January 2015 up to August

2016 on the basis of the decisions contained in the impugned Circular No 2014/GM/46/Pers

purportedly dated 27/11/2014 hereinbefore marked as P8a, whilst the Petitioners and those

similarly circumstanced, have not been paid an equivalent amount as paid to the engineers

employed in the same grade as the Petitioners, by the 3rd Respondent”. The Petitioners contend,

therefore, that the application is not time barred.

The Petitioners further contended that this Court in its decision in Ceylon Electricity Board

Accountant’s Association v Hon Patali Champika Ranawaka et al, [SC FR 18/2015, SC

minutes of 03.05.2016] already has held that there is a continuing violation of rights in this

matter.

It is pertinent to note that Ceylon Electricity Board Accountant’s Association, SC FR 18/2015

(supra) is an application made by a trade union which invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on

1 Edirisuriya v Navaratnam [(1985) 1 SLR 100], Illangaratne v Kandy Municipal Council [1995 BALJ Vol. VI Part 1 p. 10], Mutuweeran v The State [5 Sri Skantha’s Law Reports 126], Ramanathan v Tennekoonn [1988 2 CALR 187], Siriwardane v Rodrigo [(1986) 1 SLR 384], Namasivayam v Gunawardane [(1989) 1 SLR 394], Saman v Leeladasa [(1989) 1 SLR 1], Ukwatta v Marasinghe [SC FR 252/2006, SC minutes of 15.12.2010], Gamethige v Siriwardene [(1988) 1 SLR 384], Goonatilake v Piyadigama [SC FR 219/2015, SC minutes of 30.01.2014], Alawala v The Inspector General of Police [ SC FR 219/2015, SC minutes of 15.02.2016].

the basis of an alleged infringement of Rights of the members of the petitioner union due to the

“decisions contained in Circular No 2014/GM/46/Pers, purportedly dated 27/11/2014” (the

same decision impugned in the present application). The application in SC FR 18/2015 had been

filed on 6th February 2015. The Respondents in the aforementioned application by way of a

preliminary objection contended that the petitioner union has no locus standi and therefore

moved that the application be dismissed in limine. The Court having considered submissions of

all the parties held;

“that in the absence of a specific provision permitting a Trade Union to institute action

on behalf of its members, the Petitioner Union cannot have and maintain this application

on behalf of its members in terms of Article 17 read with Article 126(2) of the

Constitution” ,

and dismissed the petitioner’s application.

However, it is pertinent to note that the Court having dismissed the application, further

proceeded to observe;

“This order does not however preclude a person who has in fact suffered an injury by

reason of actual continuous violation of his fundamental rights, bringing an action

against the Respondents for judicial remedy. The Court is mindful that it would be

disastrous for the rule of law, if such person is prevented from bringing action, for it

would be open to the State or a public authority to act with impunity beyond the scope of

its power or in breach of a public duty owed by it”. (page 15 of the judgment).

The contention of the Petitioners, in the present application, that the violation complained in

these proceedings is a ‘continuous violation’ is partly based on the last mentioned dicta of this

Court, in the previous application.

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

23

It is pertinent to observe that the respondents in SC FR 18/2015 had urged four grounds in

support of their preliminary objection. They are the ‘locus standi’ of the petitioner, the unique

status of the petitioner namely that it is neither a natural nor a juristic person, failure to name

necessary parties and; the suppression and / misrepresentation of material facts. The Order of

this court dated 03.05.2016 focuses solely on one of those grounds namely the ‘locus standi’ of

the petitioner trade union. There is no material available before this Court to conclude that any of

the parties made submissions drawing the attention of the Court on the nature of the violation

alleged by the petitioner trade union, in the course of their submissions on ‘locus standi’. The

Order of this Court in the aforesaid application also does not reflect that the ‘nature of the

alleged violation’ was an issue that was focused, in the course of submissions by the parties.

Furthermore, the observation of this Court in the aforesaid Order, that

“This order does not however preclude a person who has in fact suffered an injury by

reason of actual continuous violation of his fundamental rights, bringing an action

against the Respondents for judicial remedy”;

neither reflects the nature of the material it took into consideration in making this observation

nor the reasons for such observation.

I am mindful of the strong views expressed by this Court in the aforesaid Order, but unable to

accept the contention that this Court had already determined that the violation alleged in these

proceedings is a ‘continuing violation’. Furthermore, I am of the view that the Petitioners

contention that the aforesaid Order of this Court provides a basis for the Petitioners to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court on the premise of a ‘continuing infringement’ is devoid of merit.

“The rulings of the Supreme Court is not scriptural sanction but is of ratio-wise

luminosity within the edifice of facts where the judicial lamp burns the legal flame.”

[Ceylon Electricity Board Accountant’s Association, SC FR 18/2015 (supra) at page

14].

However, it remains the duty of this Court to consider the nature of the violation alleged in the

present application, independent of the failure or success of the contention that this Court in its

previous Order had already decided that the alleged violation is a ‘continuous violation’.

This Court in Demuni Sriyani De Soyza (supra) in the context of the one-month time limitation

stipulated in Article 126(2), observed;

“There is another development in the interpretation and application of Article 126(2)

which should be mentioned here. That is, the principle that, in appropriate

circumstances, this Court may be inclined to consider whether it should extend the time

limit of one month beyond the date on which an infringement of Fundamental Rights

commenced, if that infringement is of a continuing nature” (at page 13).

Justice Prasanna Jayawardena PC, in Demuni Sriyani De Soyza (supra), having considered a

series of judgments of this Court2, in deciding whether a particular violation is ‘continuing’ in

nature recognised the difference between a ‘continuing infringement’ and the ‘continuing effect

of a decision/s taken on a particular day which immediately affect a person or decide his alleged

rights’. It is his Lordship’s view that the acts or conduct falling in to the latter category

mentioned hereinbefore would not constitute a ‘continuing violation’ of rights. His Lordship

Justice Jayawardena with the other two judges agreeing with him held;

2 Sasanasiritissa Thero v De Silva [1989 (2) SLR 356], Jayasinghe v The Attorney-General [1994 (2) SLR 74], Wijesekera v The Attorney-General [2007 (1) SLR 38], De Silva v Mathew [ SC FR 64/2009, SC minutes of 27.03.2014], Wijesekera v Lokuge [SC FR 342/2009, SC minutes of 10.06.2011], Lake House Employees Union v Associated News Papers of Ceylon LTD [SC FR 637/2009, SC minutes of 17.12.2014], Gunaratne v Sri Lanka Telecom [1993 (1) SLR 109], Dayaratne v National Savings Bank[2002 (3) SLR 116]

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

25

“An infringement can be constituted by a single, distinct and ‘one-off’ act, decision,

refusal or omission. However, some other infringements can be constituted by a series of

acts, decisions, refusals or omissions which continue over a period of time. It is only the

second type of infringement which can be correctly identified as a ‘continuing

infringement’.

It seems to me that, the essential characteristic of a ‘continuing infringement’ which is

constituted by an act or decision is that, such act or decision or similar acts or decisions

are taken several times throughout the period the infringement continues. There is a

series of acts or decisions, each of which infringe the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights,

which occur through out the period of the infringement. The result is a ‘continuing

infringement’ in relation to which the time period of one month starts on the day last such

act is done or decision is taken. It should be understood that, the type of decision

contemplated here is, usually a decision taken for the first time on a particular set of

facts and not a decision affirming a previous decision” (at page 17).

Furthermore, this Court made a distinction between the cases where an infringement is a ‘refusal

or omission’ to perform an act which should be done. The Court was of the view;

“where the infringement consists of the refusal or omission to perform an act that should

be done, the infringement will be a continuing one as long as the refusal remains in force

or the omission persists and the time period of one month specified in Article 126(2) will

start on the day on which the such refusal is made and becomes known to the Petitioner

or omission to perform the act becomes known to the Petitioner” (emphasis added)

[Demuni Sriyani De Soyza (supra) page 17-18].

When the aforementioned dicta of this Court is taken in the context of the facts of this

application under consideration, it is important to note that the Petitioners contention as reflected

in paragraphs 63, 65, 66 and 67 and prayers (b) and (c) of the Petition, that their Fundamental

Rights are violated is mainly based on the fact that “the continuous payment of salaries to the

SCFR No. 304/2016, SCFR 204/2016 & SCFR 205/2016

26

engineers employed by the 3rd Respondent, under and in terms of the impugned circular No

2014/GM/46/Pers purportedly dated 27/11/2014 …………..and by the continuous non-payment

of an equivalent salary to the Petitioners who are in the same grade as the aforesaid engineers”.

However, the Petitioners based on the pleadings in paragraph 60 and 62 and as prayed for by

prayer (d) of the Petition, move Court to declare “that the decision as contained in Circular

…………. to introduce a ‘Unified Engineering Service’ and / or an ‘E-Scale’ applicable only to

the engineers, senior engineering assistants and engineering assistants of the 3rd Respondent as

most recently given effect to by the payment of salaries on the 24th of August, 2016 is a violation

and / or continuing violation of the petitioners fundamental rights…”

Therefore, the core decision the Petitioners are challenging is the decision that is reflected in

Circular No 2014/GM/46/Pers. It is through this Circular that the ‘Unified Engineering Service’

and ‘E-Salary Scale’ were created and adopted. Material placed before this Court establishes that

the aforesaid Circular was initially published by the e-mails dated 8th January 2015 and 9th

January 2015. All the engineers, senior engineering assistants, and engineering assistants of the

3rd Respondent had been paid their salaries in accordance with the above impugned decision,

from the salary for the month of January 2015. It is abundantly clear that the payment of salaries

as per ‘E-Scale’, which commenced from the month of January 2015, is solely based on the

decision reflected in the impugned decision in Circular No 2014/GM/46/Pers. It is in giving

effect to the impugned Circular that the payment of salaries based on ‘E-Scale’ had taken place.

Therefore, the continuous payment of the salaries on a monthly basis is the effect of the decision

in the impugned circular. Such monthly payments cannot be considered a new or a continuing

infringement of rights as the alleged infringement of rights had taken place by the creation of the

‘unified engineering service’ and the adoption of ‘E-Salary Scale’ for the employees who fall

into the aforesaid service. It is the Respondent’s contention that the establishing a distinct unified

service for engineers and adopting E-Salary Scale is justified as such distinction is based on

intelligible differentia. In my view non-payment of salaries to others who do not fall within the

classification of the ‘unified engineering service’, based on E-Salary Scale, is not an ‘omission

of an act that should be done’ by the 3rd Respondent (CEB), unless and until the Court holds

that the Petitioners are also entitled to be paid their salaries on the same scale, namely E-Salary

Scale.

The sole basis on which the Petitioners contend that the application is not time-barred is that the

infringement complained of is ‘continuing’ in nature. However, as already reasoned out, I am

unable to hold that there is a ‘continuing infringement’ of the Rights of the Petitioners. The

Petitioners do not plead any other ground explaining the delay of nearly nineteen months from

the time they became aware of the impugned decision. It is also pertinent to note that there is a

delay of four months between the date of the Order in the previous application SC FR 18/2015

and the filing of the present application.

In view of the foregoing reasons, I uphold the preliminary objection of the respondents, that the

application is time-barred and therefore dismiss the application. Taking into consideration all the

facts and circumstances of this case I make no order on costs.
