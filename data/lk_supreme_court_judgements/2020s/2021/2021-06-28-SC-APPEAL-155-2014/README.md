Background

On 16th June 2005 the Complainant – Respondent – Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the “Respondent”) “Officer-in-Charge, Colombo Crimes Division, Sri Lanka Police”

[erroneously referred to in the caption of the Petition by which Special Leave to Appeal was

sought, as the “Officer-in-Charge, Special Crimes Division”] instituted criminal proceedings

against the above-named Accused – Appellant – Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

“Appellant”) in the Magistrate’s Court of Maligakanda (Case No. 22070/05). In the charge

sheet attached to the complaint filed by the Respondent in terms of section 136(1)(b) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, it was alleged that the Appellant had committed the

following offences:

1. That on or about 8th April 2005, at the Public Library in Colombo 7 situated within

the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court, exhibited for sale, gave on rent, or

possessed for trading purposes, unlawfully prepared copies of a record named

‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ containing songs titled ‘Yowun Wasanthae’ and ‘Onna

Ekoomath’ which are owned and lyrics composed by Sunil Ariyaratne, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of section 178(2) of the Intellectual

Property Act, No. 36 of 2003.

4

2. That on or about the same date, place and in the course of the same transaction of

the afore-stated offence, exhibited for sale, gave on rent, or possessed for trading

purposes unlawfully prepared copies of a record named ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’

containing 15 songs including the song titled ‘Onna Ekoomath Eka’, of which the

music was composed by, sung, and is owned by Mirihana Aarachchige Nanda

Malini, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 178(2) of

the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003.

3. That on or about the same date, place and in the course of the same transaction of

the afore-stated offence, exhibited for sale, gave on rent, or possessed for trading

purposes unlawfully prepared copies of a record named ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’,

which contained songs titled ‘Sannaliyane’ and ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ owned by

Mahagamage Raveendra Mahagamasekera and originally produced by his father,

and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 178(2) of the

Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003.

On 22nd September 2005, after the charges were read out to the Appellant, he pleaded ‘not

guilty’, and accordingly the case was taken up for trial. Witnesses Sub Inspector Roshan

Hewawitharana, Sub Inspector Prasad Weeraratne, Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, Visharadha

Mirihana Arachchige Nanda Malini, and Mahagamage Raveendra Mahagamasekera

testified for the prosecution. No evidence was presented for and on behalf of the Appellant.

At the end of the trial, the learned Magistrate delivered Judgment finding the Appellant

‘guilty’ as charged, and accordingly convicted him. He was sentenced to a substantive term

of 6 months imprisonment suspended for a period of ten years, and to a fine of Rs.

5,00,000/= with a default sentence of oneyear imprisonment.

The Appellant appealed against the afore-stated conviction and sentence to the High Court

of the Western Province holden in Colombo. Following the hearing of the Appeal, delivering

Judgment dated 20th May 2014, the learned High Court Judge affirmed the conviction and

sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate, and accordingly dismissed the Appeal.

5

The Appellant sought from this Court, Special Leave to Appeal against the Judgment of the

High Court of the Western Province. On 4th September 2014, the Supreme Court granted

Special Leave to Appeal in respect of the Judgment of the High Court of the Western

Province, on the following two questions of law:

1. Has the High Court erred in law by failing to apply the law with respect to the productions

marked “P2”, while the evidence of the prosecution has created a reasonable doubt as to the

integrity of the said productions?

2. Has the High Court failed to consider the fact that the prosecution has not proved its case

beyond reasonable doubt?

The case for the prosecution presented before the learned Magistrate can be summarized in

the following manner:

According to the evidence of Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, Visharadha Mirihana Aarachchige

Nanda Malini, and Mahagamage Raveendra Mahagamasekera, upon receiving information

that a particular person was illegally selling at the compound of the Colombo Public Library,

music compact disks (music CDs) containing songs in respect of which they held

proprietary rights, on 8th April 2005, they have gone to the Colombo Crimes Division of the

Sri Lanka Police and lodged complaints relating to this matter. The complainants alleged

that several video compact disks (VCDs) containing such unlawfully copied songs were also

being sold at the same location.

On the same day, a team of police officers led by Sub Inspector (SI) Roshan Hewawitharana

conducted a raid at the premises of the Colombo Public Library using Sub Inspector Prasad

Weeraratne as a decoy. When the police party reached the premises of the Colombo Public

Library the time was around 3.10 pm, and there had been an exhibition at the premises with

multiple stalls. The Appellant was at one stall. On a table near the Appellant were some

compact disks for sale. The compact disks (CDs) for sale included CDs titled ‘Galana Gangaki

Jeewithe’ and ‘Sannaliyane’. Decoy Weeraratne had inquired from the Appellant about the

price at which the two CDs were being sold, and the Appellant had responded that each

6

one was being sold at Rs. 150/=. Thus, the decoy had given the Appellant a 500/= Rupee

note, which SI Hewawitharana had previously given him at the police station to be used

during the raid, and purchased from the Appellant two CDs which contained the afore-

stated titles. The Appellant had returned change of Rs. 200/=. As soon as the transaction

was completed, the decoy had given the previously agreed beckoning signal and the rest of

the police officers including SI Roshan Hewawitharana had come to where SI Weeraratne

and the Appellant were. The Appellant had been arrested by SI Hewawitharana. He had

recovered the 500/= Rupee note which was tendered by the decoy to the Appellant from

the right-hand trouser pocket of the Appellant. At the time of the arrest, further eight CDs

titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ ’had been taken into the custody by the police from the

possession of the Appellant. Thereafter, the Appellant had been taken in police custody to

the police station along with the CDs. At the police station, officers have got down an audio

CD playback device to play the CDs and also a television set, and played the CDs. They had

done so in the presence of the three complainants, having got them down to the police

station following the raid. They have listened to the songs in the CDs. There is also evidence

that at the police station, the police had shown to the complainants a film contained in

another CD recovered from the Appellant’s possession. It is necessary to note that the three

charges contained in the charge sheet relate to one out of the two CDs purchased from the

Appellant by the decoy SI Weeraratne, namely the CD titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’.

Following the examination of the CDs by the police officers and the complainants at the

police station by listening to and viewing them, they had been duly sealed and placed in

safe custody, after registering the productions under reference ‘PR 46/05’. It is in evidence

that for the purpose of sealing the productions the investigators have used both the left

thumb impression of the Appellant and the police seal. Several items relating to the raid,

namely (i) the 500/= Rupee note bearing No. H/79 420550 which was used to purchase the

two compact disks, (ii) the two compact disks that were so purchased, and (iii) the eight

compact disks that were taken into custody from the possession of the Appellant, were

produced at the trial and marked “P1” (currency note), “P2A” and “P2A1” (two CDs

purchased by the decoy from the Appellant) and “P3” (the eight CDs taken by the police

from the possession of the Appellant).

7

According to Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, the compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’

was played at the police station in the room of a police officer. He observed that the disk

contained three songs of which he had composed the lyrics, namely ‘Onna Ekomath’,

‘Bambarindu Bambarindu’ and ‘Yowun Wasanthe’. These three songs were listed as items 8, 9

and 15 in the disk. Professor Ariyaratne’s position was that while he possessed co-

ownership of the intellectual property rights of these songs, the Appellant had not been

conferred with copying or publication rights of these songs. Documentary proof in this

regard was produced at the trial. According to him, at the police station they had viewed

the film ‘Sarungalaya’ from a CD collected by the police during the raid. That too had

contained his songs. However, it is necessary to note that the charge sheet does not contain

a charge based on the ‘Sarungalaya’ film, nor is there a reference to the song ‘Bambarindu

Bambarindu’, which is said to be a song of that film.

During the trial in the Magistrate’s Court, “P2A” and “P2A1” had been re-played. “P2A”

was a compact disk entitled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’. “P2A1” was entitled ‘Sannaliyane’.

“P2A” contained inter-alia the songs ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’, ‘Onna Ekomath’, ‘Bambarindu

Bambarindu’ and‘ Youwun Wasanthe’. Professor Ariyaratne has produced marked “P5” and

“P6” documents to establish his intellectual property ownership of the film ‘Diyamanthi’ in

which the song ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ is found, and the film ‘Saradiyelge Putha’ in which the

song ‘Onna Ekomath’ is found. His position was that as reflected in the said documents, he

possessed the right to authorize copying of the songs into CDs, a right which he had not

transferred to anyone.

According to Visharadha Mirihana Arachchige Nanda Malini, “P2A” which had the title

“Galana Gangaki Jeewithe”, also had the words “Edaa Geetha Edaa Handinma” (having the

meaning ‘songs of that era, from the voices of that era’). She testified that this particular CD

contained 15 songs, all of which were originally sung by her. She said that the CD contained

the song ‘Onna Ekomath’. This was a song in the film ‘Saradiyelge Putha’. After singing the

song for the production of the film she had obtained ownership of the song from the

producer of that film. According to her, her ownership of the song is reflected in “P6”. She

also testified that “P3” had eight CDs, all of which contained songs sung by her for different

films and copied and included into those CD without her permission.

8

According to Mahagamage Raveendra Mahagamasekera, his father Mahagama Sekera had

been a lyricist. He died in 1976. His father had not conveyed intellectual property rights

with regard to the songs authored by him, to anyone. Thus, upon his death, the intellectual

property rights of his late father had been inherited by his mother, himself and his brother.

After lodging the complaint, he had been asked to come to the police station to attempt to

identify the CDs that had been taken into custody during a raid that had been conducted by

the police. He had listened to some compact disks at the police station. He had identified in

the compact disk titled ‘Galanagangaki Jeewithe’, five songs written by his late father and in

the disk titled ‘Sannaliyane’ another two songs. He testified that, songs of his father are

contained in the disks titled ‘Galanagangaki Jeewithe’ and '‘Sannaliyane’. The songs of which

the lyrics had been composed by his late father found in the compact disks had been ‘Me

Sinhala Apage Ratai’, ‘Meepup Ladimi’, ‘Ratna Deepa’, ‘Pilae Pedura’, ‘Sannaliyane’, ‘Obe Deesa’,

‘Wakkada Langa’, ‘Aetha Kandukara’ and ‘Malahiru Basina’.

Following the closure of the case for the prosecution, the learned Magistrate had explained

the rights of the Accused and called upon the Accused - Appellant to, if he so wishes, present

evidence on his behalf. In response, the Accused - Appellant exercising his right to remain

silent, did not testify or offer any evidence on his behalf.

The learned Magistrate having considered the applicable law and the evidence presented

before court, concluded that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the case

against the Accused - Appellant beyond reasonable doubt, and found him guilty of having

committed all three offences contained in the charge sheet. Accordingly, the Accused -

Appellant was convicted and sentenced by the learned Magistrate, in the manner stated

above.

Submissions made by learned counsel

During the hearing of this Appeal and in his written submissions, learned counsel for the

Appellant urged on behalf of the Appellant the following matters relating to the questions

of law in respect of which special leave to appeal was granted.

9

As regards the first question of law relating to the prosecution not having established the

integrity of the production marked “P2”, it was submitted that there exists a contradiction

between the testimonies given by SI Prasad Weeraratne and Sunil Ariyaratne, in that, while

according to Prasad Weeraratne he purchased two CDs titled ‘Sannaliyane’ and

‘Galanagangaki Jeewithe’ and he watched them and realized that they contain songs,

according to Sunil Ariyaratne, he watched the film ‘Sarungalaya’ at the Police Station.

Further, according to Sunil Ariyaratne, what was produced as evidence during the trial was

not what he watched at the police station. Counsel pointed out that when the compact disk

was played in court, what was heard was a song titled ‘Bambarindu Bambarindu’. It was

submitted that Sunil Ariyaratne had not identified the production marked “P2” at the police

station. Therefore, learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that what was produced at

the trial marked “P2” was not what was taken into custody by the police, but an

introduction. Learned counsel cited Perera v. Attorney General, 1998(1) Sri L.R. 378 in

support of his submission that in view of the foregoing, there exists a serious doubt

regarding the genuineness of the productions. He further submitted that while according to

police witnesses, “P2” was sealed soon after Sunil Ariyaratne, Nanda Malini and Raveendra

Mahagamasekera examined them and they did so in the presence of the Appellant,

according to Nanda Malini, she listened to the CDs on another day too, approximately two

weeks after having listened to them on the first occasion. Learned counsel for the Appellant

submitted that this too raised a doubt regarding the integrity of the production in issue.

As regards the second question of law relating to the prosecution not having proven its case

beyond reasonable doubt, learned counsel relied with special emphasis on the issue

pertaining to the doubt arising with regard to the integrity of the production marked “P2”.

Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the prosecution had not established that

Sunil Ariyaratne, Nanda Malini and Raveendra Mahagamasekera had ownership of the

works contained in the two CDs. He also submitted that from an overall perspective, the

prosecution had not discharged its burden of proving the prosecution’s case beyond

reasonable doubt.

In response to the submissions of the learned counsel for the Appellant, learned Senior State

Counsel who appeared for the Respondent submitted that the prosecution has established

10

that what was produced as productions by the prosecution and in particular “P2”, were in

fact what was recovered from the custody of the Appellant and therefore the integrity of the

productions was intact. She also submitted that in a case where the productions are readily

identifiable, evidence relating to the ‘chain of custody’ of such productions need not be

established by the prosecution. Learned Senior State Counsel in her further written

submissions has pointed out to the following features of the two CDs marked and produced

as “P2A” and “P2A1”, namely, (i) the titles of the two CDs (i.e. “Galana Gangaki Jeewithe”

and “Sannaliyane”), (ii) the unique production reference (i.e. PR46/5) given by the police to

those CDs, (iii) the date and the markings placed on the two CDs by the police when they

were purchased by the decoy, and (iv) the two CDs having been shown to the three

complainants at the police station soon after the detection, were aspects that supported the

prosecution’s position that what was purchased from the Appellant were in fact produced

at the trial. Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the three complainants had

identified certain contents of the two CDs as containing their works, and therefore the CDs

contained intellectual property in respect of which they have proprietary rights. She

submitted that these evidential features were proof that what were produced at the trial

were in fact what was recovered from the custody of the Appellant. In support of her

submission, she cited McCormick on Law of Evidence (3rd Edition, West Publishing Co.). It

was also pointed out by the learned Senior State Counsel that during the cross-examination

of the two police officers it was not even suggested to them that what was shown to Sunil

Ariyaratne, Nanda Malini and to Raveendra Mahagamasekera were not the CDs that were

purchased by the police decoy from the Appellant. Thus, learned Senior State Counsel

pointed out that no allegation of foul play can now be made against the police. She submitted

that the prosecution had fulfilled its duty of establishing the integrity of the productions

‘without a scintilla of doubt’.

As regards the second issue raised by learned counsel for the Appellant, learned Senior State

Counsel has in her written submissions, adverted to the following: In view of the constituent

ingredients of the offence contained in section 178(2) of the Intellectual Property Act, the

prosecution does not have the legal burden of proving that the intellectual property in issue

(which the Appellant sold to the decoy) were owned by Sunil Ariyaratne, Nanda Malini and

Raveendra Mahagamasekera. What is necessary is to establish that the Appellant did not

11

have copyrights of the works contained in the two CDs. Learned Senior State Counsel

submitted that the ingredients of the offence have been successfully proven by the

prosecution. She also pointed out that the Appellant had failed to establish that he had any

rights in respect of the works in issue.

It is necessary to point out that the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Appellant

contained certain other submissions which were not urged at the hearing of this Appeal. At

the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed by counsel that post-argument written

submissions will be confined to only the matters that were in fact urged on behalf of the

parties during the hearing of this Appeal. Court indicated to learned counsel that the

judgment will also relate only to matters that were urged during the hearing. Therefore, I

will confine this judgment to my opinion and conclusions relating only to the matters that

were in fact urged by learned counsel (as reflected above) during the hearing and to the

corresponding submissions contained in the written submissions. However, while doing so,

I will consider from multiple perspectives, whether the prosecution has proven the charges

against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Consideration by Court and conclusions

In view of the inextricable link between the first and second questions of law, I propose to

deal with both questions together.

Real (physical) evidence

Learned counsel for the Appellant laid heavy emphasis on the production which he referred

to as “P2”, which should actually be a reference to compact disks (CD) marked and

produced at the trial as “P2A” and “P2A1”. His primary submission was that “the prosecution

had failed to establish the integrity of “P2”, namely, that the prosecution had failed to prove that

“P2” was the CD recovered from the Appellant’s custody, and that “P2” contained unauthorized

copies of songs of which the three complainants had copyrights”.

Productions marked and produced as “P2A”, “P2A1” and “P3” are items of real evidence.

It is to be noted that unfortunately though, such items of physical evidence are produced in

12

certain trials, without much attention being given to requirements of the law pertaining to

their admissibility and evidential significance. The present case is a good example.

According to the law of Evidence, as of right it would not be possible for a party to a criminal

or civil case to present a physical object as an item of evidence, on its own standing. This is

because it would not come within any one of the four categories of ‘evidence’ also referred

to as ‘judicial evidence’, recognized by the law of Evidence, namely ‘oral evidence’,

‘documentary evidence’, ‘contemporaneous audio-visual recordings’ and ‘computer

evidence’. The latter two categories of evidence, namely ‘contemporaneous audio-visual

recordings’ and ‘computer evidence’ gained recognition in the eyes of the law by the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, No. 14 of 1995. What is contemplated by

‘contemporaneous audio-visual recordings’ are recordings of the occurrence of the facts in

issue or relevant facts embedded in certain media, and they can take the form of audio

recordings, video recordings, audio-visual or video recordings, and still photographs.

Section 60 of the Evidence Ordinance which provides that oral evidence must in all cases

whatsoever, be direct, provides further, in its second proviso that, ”if oral evidence refers to

the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the court may, if it thinks

fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection”. (Emphasis added.) Such

material things when produced at a trial are referred to as real evidence. Thus, it would be

seen that the law of Evidence has not completely precluded the presentation of physical

material as evidence. Therefore, the sequence to be followed in the presentation of a physical

object as real evidence would be, first, to present oral evidence regarding the existence or

condition of such a physical object, and thereafter, secondly, invite the Court to consider

permitting the production of such physical object for inspection. What is important to note

is that in terms of section 60 of the Evidence Ordinance, once such a material thing is

presented to the Court, the function of the Court is to inspect it. That is for the Judge or Jury

as the case may be, to directly perceive such an object using his or their own senses. If

necessary, the Court may record its observations regarding such material object that was

produced. However, as in the case of oral and documentary evidence, a physical object is

not ordinarily produced at the trial for the purpose of proving or disproving the existence

or non-existence of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. The practice in Sri Lanka is to refer to such

items as ‘productions’. In most other jurisdictions they are referred to as ‘exhibits’.

13

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy (Volume I, at page 68) in his monumental work on the Law of

Evidence, has stated that though ‘real evidence’ does not come within the ambit of

‘Evidence’ under section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance, real evidence is an item of ‘judicial

evidence’ and the judge is called upon to see the thing himself and the knowledge derivable

therefrom is generally obtained without the use of any medium. However, in view of the

second proviso to section 60 of the Evidence Ordinance which provides for the admission

of real / physical evidence, it is necessary to bear in mind that, such evidence in the nature

of physical objects are not sui generis (does not stand alone by itself), and is necessarily

associated with an item of oral evidence which provides a description of the existence or

condition of such physical item. In other words, the Court may in terms of section 60 permit

the production of a material object for inspection, only if oral evidence refers to the existence

or the condition of any material thing. In the alternative, acting in terms of section 165 of the

Evidence Ordinance, the Court may on its own motion order the production of any document

or thing in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts.

Therefore, such evidence (physical / real evidence) in my view will serve the purposes of

(i) providing clarity to oral evidence and enable the judge or the jury as the case may be to

correctly comprehend the relevant item of oral evidence, (ii) providing corroboration of oral

testimony and documentary evidence, (iii) being used as an aide to the assessment of

credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of testimony provided by one or more witnesses,

and (iv) being a basis for the Court to determine the cogency or sufficiency of evidence

presented in the form of oral and documentary evidence. Thus, an item of real evidence

cannot by itself generally be used to ‘prove’ the facts in issue, which in criminal cases

amounts to the constituent ingredients of the offence. In certain situations, a physical object

may be produced at a trial for the first time, for the purpose of its identification. That may

aid the proof of a fact in issue or a relevant fact.

The impact or the legal consequences arising out of the absence of a particular physical item

of evidence being presented by the prosecution at a trial will depend on a host of

considerations, including the attendant facts and circumstances of the case. In such

situations, the principal factor to be taken into consideration is, what purpose, if any, would

the prosecution have achieved, had they produced the relevant item of real evidence. As

14

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy has put it, “non-production of a physical object, which might

conveniently be produced for inspection by the Court, does not render oral evidence respecting the

same inadmissible” (Volume II, Book I, page 19). The legal consequences arising out of a doubt

being created with regard to the integrity of a physical object that was produced, would be

founded upon a consideration of the purpose sought to have been achieved by the party

which produced the object. The legal consequences that may arise by a party not producing

a material object which was within their control to produce, would be the rendering of

nugatory the purpose such party could have achieved by having produced it. It may also

affect the cogency of the evidence. There may be situations where the circumstances of the

case may justify the judge from drawing an adverse presumption in terms of section 114(f)

of the Evidence Ordinance.

I will now apply these principles of law with regard to the submission made by learned

counsel for the Appellant relating to the productions produced at the trial, and in particular

to production marked “P2A” (“Galana Gangaki Jeewithe”), which he erroneously submitted

had been marked as “P2”. In this regard, it is necessary to recall that all three charges relate

to songs said to have been contained only in one CD, and that being the CD titled “Galana

Gangaki Jeewithe”.

Particularly in view of the emphasis shown by the learned counsel for the Appellant with

regard to these productions, I examined the productions relating to the Magistrate’s Court

case. The examination of the productions revealed the following:

Production marked “P2A”

This production is a compact disk (CD) with a cover. The cover contains the title

“Galana Gangaki Jeewithe”. In addition to the title of the CD, the front cover contains

the following in Sinhala and English. “Eda Geetha Eda Handinma”, “Solid Gold Old

Songs” and “Old is Gold”. Its rear contains the following words: “Nanda Malini Geyu

Chithrapata Geetha”, and “Sahaya Gayana – Narada Dissasekera, W.D. Amaradeva,

Sisira Senaratne, Victor Ratnayake”. It also contains references to the existence of 15

songs inside the CD and a list of such songs. Within brackets there is a reference to

15

the film in which the relevant song is to be found. Among the list of the songs are

“Galana Gangaki Jeewithe” (“Ranmuthuduwa”) as item No. 1, “Onna Ekomath”

(“Saradiyelge Putha”) as item No. 8 and “Yowun Wasanthe” (“Diyamanthi”) as item No.

15. It should be noted that, it is these songs, that are referred to in the three charges

contained in the charge sheet.

Production marked “P2A1”

Though another CD entitled “Sannaliyane” and marked “P2A1” was available

among the productions, I do not propose to set out details of that CD, as none of the

charges relate to a CD by that name. Suffice for me to state that “P2A1” contained a

list of songs, which included the songs which Raveendra Mahagamasekera claimed

had been authored by his father late Mahagama Sekera.

Constituent ingredients of the offence

Section 178(2) of the IP Act provides as follows:

“Any person knowing or having reason to believe that copies have been made in infringement of the

rights protected under Part II of the Act, sells, displays for sale, or has in his possession for sale or

rental or for any other purpose of trade any such copies, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be

liable on conviction by a Magistrate for …”

Therefore, the actus reus of this offence is that the offender should have (i) sold, (ii)

displayed for sale, or (iii) had in his possession for sale or for rental or for any other purpose

of trade, a ‘copy’ that has been made in infringement of the rights protected under Part II of

the Act. The offence does not require the prosecution to prove that the copying was carried

out by the offender, as ‘copying’ is not a constituent ingredient of the offence. The mens rea

of the offence is that the offender should have either (i) known or (ii) had reason to believe

that the ‘copy’ in issue had been made by whomsoever in infringement of the rights

protected under Part II of the Act.

Copyrights

In the context of the IP Act, the term ‘copy’ is a reference to a ‘copy’ of a ‘work’ that is

recognized by that Act. In terms of section 5 of the IP Act, a ‘work’ means ‘any literary,

16

artistic or scientific work referred to in section 6’. In terms of section 6, both ‘musical works,

with or without accompanying words’ and ‘audio-visual works’ fall within the ambit of ‘protected

literary, artistic or scientific work’, provided they are ‘original intellectual creations in the

literary, artistic and scientific domain’. Therefore, original songs are ‘works’ that are

protected in terms of the Act. In terms of section 6(2) of the Act, such ‘works’ shall be legally

protected by the sole fact of their creation, and irrespective of their mode or form of

expression, as well as of their content, quality or purpose. Section 9 of the Act provides that

‘subject to the provisions of sections 11 to 13, the owner of copyright of a work shall have the

exclusive right to carry out or authorize inter alia the acts of (a) reproduction of the work,

and (b) the public distribution of the original and each copy of the work by sale, rental,

export or otherwise, of such work’. These two rights along with the other rights contained

in section 9 of the IP Act are referred to as ‘economic rights’. Sections 11 to 13 confers

exceptions with regard to copyright protection, namely copying for the purposes of fair use

and copying following the lapse of seventy years following the death of the author. In terms

of section 10 of the IP Act, authors of ‘works’ are also conferred with ‘moral rights’, which

includes the right to have his name indicated prominently on the copies of the work. It is

important to note that authors are entitled to such ‘moral rights’, independently of the

‘economic rights’, and even when the author is no longer the owner of the ‘economic rights’

of a work. In terms of section 5 of the Act, an ‘author’ is the physical person who had created

the ‘work’. He would normally have both the economic and moral rights of the relevant ‘work’.

As per section 6(1)(e) of the IP Act, for the purposes of the application of the provisions of

the Act, a song would be a protected ‘work’, as it is a ‘musical work with accompanying words

in the artistic domain’. Similarly, as per section 6(1)(f), a film (motion picture) would also be

a protected ‘work’, as it is ‘an audio-visual work in the artistic domain’. The term ‘audio-visual

work’ has been interpreted in the IP Act to mean ‘a work that consists of a series of related images

which impart the impression of motion, with or without accompanying sounds, susceptible of being

made visible, and where accompanied by sounds susceptible of being made audible’. Section 5 of the

IP Act provides that the ‘author’ means the physical person who has created the relevant

‘work’. In the context of a song, for the purpose of the application of the IP Act, the ‘author’

of a song would be the lyricist, music composer, and should there have been a producer,

such producer of the song. This is in view of the fact that they perform constituent and

17

indispensable functions relating to the creation of a song. The ‘author’ of a film would be its

proprietor, who is designated as the ‘producer’ of the film. In terms of section 5 of the IP

Act, the ‘producer’ of an ‘audio-visual work’ means the physical person or legal entity that

undertakes the initiative and responsibility for the making of the relevant audio-visual work

or sound recording. Thus, in terms of the law, the producer of the film would originally

have the film’s economic and moral rights.

The lyricist, music composer and the producer of a song jointly have economic rights to inter

alia authorize the reproduction of the song. That is a reference to the ‘copying’ of the song

from one media to another. If a song is made for the purpose of an ‘audio-visual work’ (such

as a film) and integrated into such film, unless otherwise provided, the producer of the film

will be vested with the economic and moral rights of the film, which would include such

rights in respect of components of the film including the song included in the film.

Therefore, when a song is embedded in a film, unless specifically protected through

agreement, the lyricist, music composer and the producer of the song would lose economic

rights in respect of the song. Thus, right to authorize copying of the song into a media (such

as a compact disk) will be vested with the producer of the film. Reproducing the song

without obtaining the authorization of such a person who has economic rights of the work,

would amount to an infringement of the economic rights of the owner of the film, namely

the producer. The position would be different if the song is produced again and provided a

new fixation. However, it is important to note that when a song becomes a component of a

film, though the lyricist, music composer and the producer of such song lose their economic

rights, they retain moral rights with regard to the original song. It is also necessary for the

purposes of this Appeal to be mindful that a producer of a film or any other subsequent

copyright owner of such film, may in terms of section 16 of the Act grant a license, an

assignment or transfer to any other person in writing, and the right to carry out any of the

acts arising out of economic rights in whole or any part of such economic rights. Unless

specifically precluded in the licensing, assignment or transfer agreement, there is no

prohibition in law for a licensee, assignee or transferee to re-transfer the rights he has

received to another third party.

18

Section 17 of the Act prescribes the rights of performers, such as singers of songs. In terms

of section 17(1) of the Act, subject to the provisions of section 21 of the IP Act (provision

which sets out certain limitations), a performer (such as the singer of a song) shall have

exclusive right to carry out or to authorize inter alia the reproduction of a fixation of his

performance or a substantial part thereof. According to law, for a work to be protectable, it

must be fixed to a tangible medium of expression. A work is considered to be fixed when it is

stored on some medium in which it can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise

communicated. Thus, when a song is recorded onto a compact disk (CD) the work is deemed

to be fixed to the compact disk on which the song has been recorded. That is referred to as a

fixation. Therefore, the authorization of the singer of a song is required for the preparation

of copies of the fixation in which such song has been recorded. Thus, the preparation of

copies of such a compact disk without obtaining the authorization of the original performer

(singer), would amount to an infringement of the rights of such performer. However, when

a song has been sung for inclusion in a film and such song has been included into such film,

unless otherwise specifically provided in the agreement between the singer and the

producer of the film, the singer loses his rights under section 17(1). That is in view of section

17(2) of the Act which provides that once a performer has authorized the incorporation of

his performance into an audio-visual fixation (such as a film), the provisions of section 17(1)

shall have no further application. If the performer once again performs with the permission

of the producer of the film, that performance will be recognized as a different performance,

and section 17(1) will become applicable once again. However, if such subsequent

performance is a component of a different fixation, the rights of the singer will be limited to

the agreement between the singer and the producer of such subsequent fixation. In this case,

the position of the complainants is that unauthorized copying had taken place from the

original films.

Fixations such as compact disks containing unauthorized reproductions / copies of works

such as songs, songs extracted from films and films themselves, are generally referred to as

‘pirated copies’.

The essence of the above narrative of the law relating copyrights which is a component of

Intellectual Property Law, as is relevant to the facts of this case, is that the preparation of

19

unauthorized copies, the sale, and the possession for sale pirated copies of songs including

songs copied out of films and copying of songs into other fixations, whether in their audio-

visual form or audio only form, is prohibited by the Intellectual Property Act. The violation

of that prohibition amounts to an offence, as the preparation of such copies infringes upon

the rights recognized by Part II of the IP Act. Additionally, in terms of section 178(2) of the

Act, selling, displaying for sale, and having in possession for sale, rental or for any other

purpose of trade any such copies prepared in violation of copyrights, is also prohibited by

law, and the violation of such prohibition constitutes an offence.

Charges

The first charge preferred against the Appellant relates to the songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ and

‘Onna Ekomath’, which the prosecution claimed were in a compact disk entitled ‘Galana

Gangaki Jeewithe’. The second charge also relates to the song ‘Onna Ekomath’ in the same disk.

The third charge relates to the songs ‘Sannaliyane’ and ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ in the disk

named ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’. According to the first charge, the position of the

prosecution was that Sunil Ariyaratne had ‘ownership’ of the songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe‘ and

‘Onna Ekomath’. According to the second charge, the prosecution alleged that Mirihana

Arachchige Nanda Malini also had ‘ownership’ of the song ‘Onna Ekomath’. According to the

third charge, the prosecution alleged that Raveendra Mahagamasekera had ownership of

the songs ‘Sannaliyane’ and ‘Galanagangaki Jeewithe’ said to have been in the same CD titled

‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’. Thus, it would be seen that, all three charges are related to a

compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ in which the songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe‘,

‘Onna Ekomath’, ‘Sannaliyane’ and ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ were said to have been

found.

Actus reus of the offence

I will now examine and arrive at a conclusion on whether the prosecution has proven the

actus reus or the physical element of the offence contained in section 178(2) of the Act. For

that purpose, it is necessary to re-visit the evidence led at the trial.

According to the evidence of Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, he had been the lyricist of the songs

‘Yowun Wasanthe’ and ‘Onna Ekomath’. The song ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ had been a component

20

of the film ‘Diyamanthi’. Professor Ariyaratne had obtained copyrights for the audio-visual

display through multi-media of the film ‘Diyamanthi’ ’from the producer of the film,

Wasantha Obeysekera. Thus, he exclaimed that he had copyrights of the songs in the film

‘Diyamanthi’ and documentary proof thereof was tendered to court by producing the

document marked “P5”. Therefore, his position was that he had copyrights of the song

‘Yowun Wasanthe’. The song ‘Onna Ekomath’ had been a component of the film ‘Saradiyalge

Putha’. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Visharadha Nanda Malini had jointly obtained

copyrights for audio-visual display of the film ‘Saradiyelge Putha’ from the producer of the

film Neil Rupasinghe, and a document in proof of that was produced marked “P6”.

Therefore, his position was that he and Nanda Malini had joint copyrights for the song

‘Onna Ekomath’. He had not transferred copyrights of these two songs to any other person.

Nor had he given such rights to any other person authorizing the copying of these two songs

onto compact disks or to sell disks containing such copies.

On 8th April 2005, when Professor Ariyaratne was informed by officers of the Colombo

Crimes Division that sequel to his complaint, a raid had been conducted, and thus to call-

over at the police station, he complied. At the police station, he listened to and viewed

several compact disks that had been recovered by the police during the raid. It is indeed a

fact that according to Professor Ariyaratne, at the police station he had viewed a film titled

‘Sarungale as well. Among the items he listened to, was a compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki

Jeewithe’ which contained the abovementioned songs in respect of which he possessed

copyrights. He has observed that the songs were of the nature of the original songs. He

noted that the ‘publisher’ listed on the label of the compact disk, namely Sajindra Video, of

No. 32, Super Market, Padukka, had not been conferred with copyrights relating to these

songs. Additionally, the compact disk did not contain a reference that the lyricist of these

songs was Professor Sunil Ariyaratne. It is this compact disk which was produced marked

“P2A” during the trial.

According to Visharadha Nanda Malini, the song ‘Onna Ekomath’ had been originally sung

by her for the film ‘Saradiyelge Putha’. She had done so, having directed the music of that

song too. She had also obtained copyrights of that song through a document marked “P6”.

Her position was also that she had neither transferred rights in respect of that song to any

21

other person or given permission for copying the song onto compact disks or for selling

such disks containing her songs. She also testified that the compact disk titled ‘Galana

Gangaki Jeewithe’ (marked and produced at the trial as “P2A”) contains fifteen songs, and all

of them were sung by her. The song ‘Onna Ekomath’ was the eighth song in that compact

disk. She vouched for the fact that, the recording she listened to at the police station,

contained her own voice. On being shown “P6” which was previously produced by

Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, Visharadha Nanda Malini admitted that it was through “P6”

that she too claimed copyrights to the song ‘Onna Ekomath’. Having examined the eight

compact disks marked “P3”, the witness testified that they too contained pirated copies of

her film songs.

According to Mahagamage Raveendra Mahagamasekera, his late father Mahagama Sekara

had composed the lyrics of the songs ‘Ratna Deepa’ ‘Pile Pedura’, ‘Sannaliyane’, ‘Obe Deesa’,

‘Wakkada Langa’, ‘Eatha Kandukara’, ‘Mala Hiru Basina’, ‘Me Sinhala Apege Ratai’ and ‘Meepup

Ladimi’. He had identified these songs in the two CDs that were played at the police station

after the raid. There had been two of his father’s songs in the CD titled ‘Galana Gangaki

Jeewithe’ five of his father’s songs in the CD titled ‘Sannaliyane’. Neither his father nor his

mother, brother or himself, being the only heirs who jointly succeeded to his father’s rights,

had transferred those rights to anyone else or authorized the preparation of copies onto

compact disks. However, he has not stated that the CD titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’

(marked and produced by the prosecution as “P2A”) contained songs ‘Sannaliyane’ and

‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ composed by his father. Thus, it is necessary to conclude that,

through the evidence of Raveendra Mahagama Sekera, the prosecution has failed to

establish the actus-reus of the third charge.

This witness has testified to the manner in which he got to know of the Appellant. In 2004,

he had received information that a particular person was selling pirated copies of compact

disks containing songs of which the lyrics had been written by his late father. Thus, he had

visited the premises of the Colombo Public Library and met the Appellant who was selling

the compact disks. The witness had purchased such a compact disk and asked for a receipt.

The Appellant had declined to issue a receipt. The Appellant had explained that he (the

Appellant) had purchased some gramophone records, and thus he was entitled to produce

22

and sell compact disks containing the relevant songs. The witness had responded that his

father had not authorized any person to reproduce his songs. He had thus said that what

the Appellant was doing was ‘illegal’, and that if he (the Appellant) were to continue to

engage in such conduct he would be compelled to take legal action. After some time, as he

had received information that the Appellant was continuing with the particular ‘illegal’

activity, the witness had informed the situation to Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and to

Visharadha Nanda Malini, and had with them proceeded to the police and lodged a

complaint.

From the foregoing evidence, I hold that the prosecution has successfully and beyond

reasonable doubt proved that Professor Sunil Ariyaratne had economic rights in respect of

the songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ and ‘Onna Ekomath’, which were components of the films

‘Diyamanthi’ and ‘Saradiyelge Putha’, which inter-alia conferred the right on him to authorize

the copying of those songs to audio-visual media such as compact disks. Thus, copying of

such songs without his permission would amount to a violation of the copyrights of

Professor Sunil Ariyaratne. Further, Professor Sunil Ariyaratne also possessed moral rights

with regard to those songs. I also hold that Visharadha Nanda Malini had economic rights

with regard to authorizing the copying to audio-visual media such as to compact disks, of

the song ‘Onna Ekomath’ which was a component of the afore-stated film ‘Diyamanthi’.

The economic rights of Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Visharadha Nanda Malini had not

been given by license, or assignment or transferred by them to either the Appellant or to

any other person.

I hold that the prosecution has failed to establish that Raveendra Mahagamasekera had

moral rights of the song ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’, which the prosecution claimed in the third

count in the charge sheet was in a CD titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’. Further, though the

prosecution has through the evidence of Raveendra Mahagamasekera established that the

late Mahagama Sekera was the lyricist of the song ‘Sannaliyane’ and hence Raveendra

Mahagamasekera, his mother and brother had rights in respect of such song, as that song

was not in the CD titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’, the third charge fails. Further, though

outside the scope of the third charge, it is necessary for me to point out that, the evidence of

23

Raveendra Mahagamasekera reveals that the economic rights he jointly possessed with his

mother and brother relating to songs authorized by his late father had been infringed by the

unauthorized copying and possessing for sale CDs containing songs authored by the late

Mahagama Sekera. These songs are to be found in CDs marked “P2A” and “P2A1”.

However, as the third charge has been framed in a faulty manner, the said evidence cannot

be relied upon by the prosecution to prove the third charge.

The prosecution has established without any doubt that the Appellant ‘sold’ inter-alia a

compact disk to Sub Inspector Prasad Weeraratne, which was prior to its sale in the

possession of the Appellant. The said compact disks ‘purchased’ by Sub Inspector Prasad

Weeraratne had been titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’. That compact disk (“P2A”) along with

the compact disk marked “P2A1” and the other eight compact disks had been brought to

the police station along with the Appellant. Soon afterwards, the compact disk titled ‘Galana

Gangaki Jeewithe’ had been played to be heard by Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, Visharadha

Nanda Malini and Raveendra Mahagamasekera. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Visharada

Nanda Malini identified several songs including the three songs referred to in the first and

second charges in respect of which they had the copyrights referred to above. The

prosecution has established beyond doubt the integrity of the compact disk ‘Galana Gangaki

Jeewithe’ from the stage it was ‘purchased’ from the Appellant to the stage at which it was

played to be heard by the three complainants. Therefore, the integrity of the compact disk

in issue is not in doubt, up to the stage when it was identified that the disk contained songs

copied in violation of the copyrights of the owners of such copyrights, namely the afore-

stated two complainants. Thus, I conclude that, the prosecution had proved beyond

reasonable doubt the actus reus of the offence, namely that the Appellant had in his

possession for sale a compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ which contained

copies of songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ and ‘Onna Ekomath’ of which the copyrights were

vested with Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Visharadha Nanda Malini. Such copies had

been made in infringement of the rights protected under Part II of the Act.

Integrity of the productions

In view of the submissions strenuously made by learned counsel for the Appellant that the

integrity of the production marked “P2” had not been established by the prosecution, in that

24

the prosecution had not established beyond doubt that the compact disks in issue (marked

“P2A” and “P2A1”) were in fact the compact disks recovered from the possession of the

Appellant and were also the disks that were played at the police station and listened to by

the three complainants, I need to point out the following: As pointed out by me previously,

the production relating to the three charges are the productions that were marked “P2A”.

The abovementioned analysis of the evidence, reveals clearly that from the perspective of

the need to maintain the integrity of the production, what was necessary for the prosecution

to establish is that the compact disk that was listened to by the complainants at the police

station was in fact one out of the several disks recovered from the possession of the

Appellant. I hold that the said duty has been performed by the prosecution beyond

reasonable doubt.

The situation would have been quite different had the prosecution attempted to get the

songs identified for the first time by the complainants during the trial in the well of the

Court. Then, it would have been incumbent on the prosecution to establish the integrity of

the productions from the time they were taken into custody to the point they were produced

in Court during the trial.

Even if the submission strenuously put forward by the learned counsel for the Appellant is

accepted as being correct, it is necessary to point out that the prosecution has established

that the compact disk marked “P2A”and produced at the trial was in fact that which was

recovered from the possession of the Appellant and identified by the complainants at the

police station. That conclusion has been reached by me due to the reasons that (a) there is

cogent and reliable evidence that the compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ ’having

been ‘purchased’ from the Appellant was soon afterwards played at the police station to be

heard by the three complainants, (b) the defence has not presented any evidence either

through prosecution witnesses themselves or through defence witnesses indicative of the

said compact disk having been ‘introduced’ or ‘switched’ either by the police or by a

complainant, (c) as pointed out by the learned Senior State Counsel the compact disk titled

‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ had certain unique identification features, (d) soon after listening

to the compact disks, the compact disks were sealed using the left thumb impression of the

Appellant and the seal of the Officer-in-Charge of the police station (these being un-

25

impugned items of evidence), (e) the productions had been entered in the Production

Register of the police station and thereby assigned a ‘PR’ number (un-impugned), and (f) as

observed by the learned Magistrate, the afore-stated seals were intact at the time the

productions were opened for the first time at the trial (another item of un-impugned

evidence). Thus, there can be no doubt regarding the integrity of the productions, even from

the standard and degree expounded by the learned counsel for the Appellant.

Mens Rea of the offence

It is now necessary to examine whether the Appellant possessed the requisite mens rea

which is also referred to as the ‘fault element of the offence’. In view of the manner in which

the offence contained in section 178(2) has been structured, it would be necessary for the

prosecution to prove that at the time the Appellant possessed for sale the compact disk titled

‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’, he either (i) ‘knew’, or (ii) ‘had reason to believe’, that the copies

of the four songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe’, and ‘Onna Ekomath’ contained in the said compact

disk, had been made in infringement of the rights protected under Part II of the Act.

Thus, the issue is whether the Appellant knew or had reason to believe that the compact disk

in issue (“P2A”) contained pirated copies of the afore-stated songs. The term ‘knew’ as the

literal meaning of the English word ‘knowledge’ denotes and signifies the existence of

specific knowledge by the accused regarding a particular fact. The term ‘reason to believe’ has

been interpreted in section 24 of the Penal Code. It provides that, “a person is said to have

‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing, but not otherwise”.

(Emphasis added.) Thus, the term ‘had reason to believe’ denotes the existence of certain

related knowledge on the part of the accused, based upon which, from an objective standard

it can be reasonably inferred that the accused ought to have known the existence of the

relevant fact. In other words, what the Court needs to consider is whether in the

circumstances of the case, the accused either ‘knew’ or ‘had sufficient cause to believe’ the

existence of the particular fact.

‘Criminal Law in Sri Lanka’ by Wing-Cheong Chan, Michael Her, Neil Morgan, Jeeva Niriella

and Stanley Yeo (LexisNexis, India, 1st Edition, 2020), states as follows: “Knowledge involves

an awareness that something exists or is likely to exist in the future. … Knowledge is a subjective

26

state of mind which is different from an objective assessment of whether one should know certain

facts. It cannot be imputed to a person merely from the consequences resulting from the act. … Since

the Penal Code sometimes uses the terms ‘knowing’ and ‘having reason to believe’ in the same section,

it can be inferred that the fault element of ‘knowing’ something must be given a subjective meaning.

… It may be possible to infer that an accused had knowledge from proof that they had suspicion of the

true facts, but deliberately refrained from making further inquiries which would have confirmed the

suspicion.”

As Dr. Sir Hair Singh Gour in ‘The Penal Law of India’ (Diamond Jubilee - 10th Edition,

Volume 1, page 242) has pointed out, “what is a sufficient cause in a given case so as to justify

the presumption, is a matter upon which no general statement can be made, for it must depend upon

the facts and circumstances of each case”. This is a reference to the presumption of the existence

of ‘knowledge’.

The formulation ‘had reason to believe’ also in my view prevents an accused from taking up

a position which can be aptly referred to as wilful ignorance or voluntary blindness to the

obvious. Further, this element of mens rea has been included in most offences where knowledge

is the foundational mens rea, as it would otherwise be impractical in most situations for a

prosecution to prove through evidence that the accused actually had the required knowledge

of the existence of the relevant fact. When in the ‘mens rea’, the term ‘had reason to believe’ is

the alternate component to ‘knowledge’, the burden on the prosecution is to establish that

certain related circumstances were known to the accused, and hence from an objective

footing he ought to have known of the existence of the relevant fact. Thus, from the

perspective of sufficiency of evidence to prove the mens rea, it would be pertinent to note

that to prove the requirement of ‘had reason to believe’ would require a lesser threshold of

evidence than the threshold required to prove ‘knowledge’.

Unlike with regard to the actus reus of an offence, the mens rea of an offence is a state of mind

of the perpetrator, and hence it would not be possible to prove such ingredient through

direct evidence. The existence of the mens rea of an offence has to be inferred by Court, based

on a consideration of circumstantial evidence led by the prosecution, coupled with

principles of evidence, such as inferences arising out of evidence, presumptions, and

27

matters in respect of which the Court is entitled to take judicial notice. With regard to mens

rea in offences that contain the element ‘knowing or having reason to believe’, to find the

accused guilty, upon a consideration of the available evidence which is likely to be in the

nature of circumstantial evidence, the Court must be in a position to arrive at an irresistible

and inescapable sole interference that the accused either had the requisite knowledge, or

should have had reason to believe in the existence of the relevant facts pertaining to such

knowledge. Thereafter, such knowledge can be imputed as the state of mind of the accused.

An inference less or different to that will accrue to the benefit of the accused and he shall be

entitled to be acquitted. Even after the Court arrives at such inference based on the

prosecution evidence, it may be possible for the accused to negate that inference upon a

presentation of direct evidence that may emanate from the Accused himself, that he did not

have the requisite state of mind and was acting in good-faith.

If one were to consider the evidence led at the trial including the attendant circumstances,

it can be reasonably inferred that either the Appellant had himself made unauthorized

copies of the songs or had procured the compact disks from a person such as the person /

institution referred to in the label of disks (Sajindra Video, of No. 32, SuperMarket, Padukka)

who had made the unauthorized copies. If in fact the Appellant had in good faith received

the disks containing unauthorized copies of the songs in issue from either Sajindra Video or

from some other third party, that would be a matter especially within his own knowledge.

Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that, when any fact is especially within the

knowledge of any person, the burden of proving such fact lies upon him. The Appellant has not

presented any evidence in this regard or with regard to any other matter. In this regard it is

also necessary to take into consideration the evidence of Raveendra Mahagama Sekera,

about the incident which had taken place in 2004, where he met the Appellant and

purchased a compact disk containing unauthorized copies of his father’s songs. On that

occasion, the Appellant had taken up the position that he had purchased an old record

containing those songs (referred to by the Appellant as a ‘gramophone record’) and hence he

had the right to sell copies of the songs. Nevertheless, Raveendra Mahagama Sekera had

challenged the Appellant that what he was doing was ‘illegal’. Thus, in 2004, the Appellant’s

position was that he had obtained copies of the songs, and that he had the right to do so.

Another important item of circumstantial evidence is that the prosecution has proved that

28

the other compact disk purchased by Sub Inspector Prasad Weeraratne from the Appellant

titled ‘Sannaliyane’ (“P2A1”), and the other eight compact disks (“P3”) secured from the

Appellant’s possession, all contained pirated material such as unauthorised copies of songs

of Visharadha Nanda Malini and songs authored by the late Mahagama Sekera. Finally,

both the external appearance of the compact disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ (“P2A”)

“Sannaliyane” (“P2A1”) and their contents did not contain any reference to the lyricists of

the songs contained in the compact disk, namely Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and the late

Mahagama Sekera. The external appearance of the disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’

however contained a reference to the singer of the songs contained in it, namely Visharadha

Nanda Malini, in the phrase ‘Nanda Malini Gayuu Chithrapata Geetha’ (meaning ‘film songs

sung by Nanda Malini’). Thus, there was an ex-facie infringement of the moral rights of

lyricists Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Mahagama Sekera in the two CDs marked “P2A”

and “P2A1”.

In view of all the afore-stated circumstances, I conclude that an irresistible and inescapable

inference arises that the Appellant knew or certainly had reason to believe that the compact

disk titled ‘Galana Gangaki Jeewithe’ contained copies of the songs ‘Yowun Wasanthe’ and

‘Onna Ekomath which had been made in infringement of the rights protected under Part II

of the Intellectual Property Act. Thus, I am satisfied that the prosecution has discharged its

burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant entertained the requisite

mens rea of the offence contained in section 178(2) of the Intellectual Property Act, with

which he was charged.

Proof beyond reasonable doubt

As pointed out by the learned counsel for the Appellant, indeed, in a criminal trial, the

prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Learned Senior State Counsel

also did not express disagreement with this standard of proof expected from the prosecution

in any criminal case, which is a salient feature in adversarial criminal cases in common law

jurisdictions. The degree of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ apart from its historical roots

in the common law tradition and the adversarial system of criminal justice, specifically

arises out of a fundamental right enshrined in Article 13(5) of the Constitution. That being,

the ‘presumption of innocence until and accused is proven guilty’ and the right to a ‘fair trial’.

29

These two fundamental rights are cornerstones of our criminal justice system in which

fairness is a governing principle. It is a principle enshrined in in Sri Lanka’s legal system.

However, the presumption of innocence is rebuttable, and will prevail only until the

presumption is vacated by Court, due to the cogency of evidence that the prosecution has

presented. The importance and the weight of the presumption of innocence is such, that in

order to vacate that presumption, the case for the prosecution must be proven beyond

reasonable doubt. A ‘reasonable doubt’ means a doubt in respect of which a valid reason can

be attributed. For a ‘doubt’ to be recognized as amounting to a ‘reasonable doubt’, the ground

for the development of the doubt must be objective and reason based. There should be a

logical basis for the entertaining of the doubt. That is the distinction between a ‘mere doubt’

and a ‘reasonable doubt’.

John Woordroffe & Amir Ali in ‘Law of Evidence’ (18th Edition, Volume 1, page 325) has

described ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ in the following manner:

“For a doubt to stand in the way of conviction of guilt, it must be a real doubt and a reasonable doubt

– a doubt which after full and fair consideration of the evidence, the judge really, on reasonable

grounds, entertains. … If the data leaves the mind of the trier in equilibrium, the decision must be

against the party having the burden of persuasion. … If the mind of the adjudicating tribunal is

evenly balanced as to whether the accused is guilty or not, it is its duty of the tribunal to acquit. If

the evidence adduced by the prosecution has been so discredited as a result of cross-examination or is

as manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal can safely convict based on it, the prosecution

must fail. The court cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, if there are still some reasonable

hypotheses compatible with the innocence of the accused. There is no emancipation of the mind, unless

all reasonable doubts have been eliminated from it. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean

proof beyond the shadow of doubt. The benefit of doubt, to which the accused is entitled to, is

reasonable doubt; the doubt which rational thinking men will reasonably, honestly and

conscientiously entertain, and not the doubt of a timid mind.”

Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions [(1947) 2 AER 372] referring to the degree of

proof the prosecution must satisfy, has held that “… it need not reach certainty, but it must

carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a

shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to

30

deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man, as to leave only a remote

possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence ‘of course it is possible, but not in

the least probable’, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that would

suffice.”

In The King v. Vidanalage Abraham Appu [40 NLR 505] Acting Chief Justice Soertsz has held

that “ … so far as the case for the prosecution in a criminal trial is concerned, it will not suffice for

it to make out a case of grave suspicion against an accused person, it must establish its case, and so

long as there is reasonable doubt left, there is no proof. The phrase ‘to prove beyond reasonable

doubt’ is explanatory of the meaning of the word ‘prove’.”

In terms of section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance, a fact is said to be proved when, after

considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist or considers its

existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular

case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. Therefore, on an application of the principle

contained in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinances buttressed by the earlier mentioned

judicial precedents, I am of the opinion that, a criminal case can be considered to have been

proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, if in the objective mind of the Judge

or the jury, as the case may be, the prosecution has presented sufficient cogent evidence

which causes the Judge or the jury to believe that the accused had committed the offence he

has been charged with, or the judge or the jury considers that the accused having committed

the offence to be so probable that the judge or the jury ought, under the circumstances of

the case, act upon the supposition that the accused committed the offence. A case is ‘proven

beyond reasonable doubt’, when a state of mind develops in the judge or the jury as the case

may be, as to belief in the truthfulness of the assertion made by the prosecution, and the

absence of a logically sound reason to doubt that assertion.

If either due to the sheer nature of the prosecution’s evidence, or as a result of the defence

impugning the prosecution’s evidence, or through the presentation of defence evidence, or

through a combination of such means, the defence raises what the judge / jury believes to

be a ‘reasonable doubt’ regarding the case for the prosecution, the benefit of such doubt must

necessarily accrue to be benefit of the accused, and the accused would therefore be entitled

31

to be acquitted. The prosecution is required to prove all the ingredients of the offence the

accused has been charged with (which would include the actus reus and the mens rea of the

offence), ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. It must be borne in mind that proving the prosecution’s

case beyond reasonable doubt requires a very high degree of cogency and sufficiency of

evidence. It is a very high standard to meet. Mere conjecture, theories, suspicion or even

proving a case to a degree that the judge or the jury would form the view that the accused

may have committed the offence, is wholly insufficient. Furthermore, proving a case on a

balance of probabilities is also wholly insufficient. However, proving a case beyond

reasonable doubt is distinct from and lesser in degree than proving a case to a degree of

mathematical accuracy. The law does not require the prosecution to prove its case with

scientific precision and to a degree of mathematical accuracy. Proving a case beyond

reasonable does not mean that there should be proof beyond a shadow of doubt or fanciful

or imaginary doubts. Prosecutions have to primarily rely on human testimony. With all the

inherent weaknesses of human testimony, it would not be reasonably possible and would

in fact be unattainable to achieve such an extremely high degree of proof. Therefore, what

is necessary is to prove the prosecution’s case beyond reasonable doubt, which in fact means

that, on an objective consideration of the evidence presented by the prosecution and should

the defence have opted to present evidence, on a consideration of such defence evidence as

well, would a reasonable person considering the evidence objectively, entertain either

absence or lack of belief that the accused in fact committed the offence.

As E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy has put it, “the presumption of innocence merely means that the

prosecution must prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The two rules mean

the same concept … The presumption of innocence is so strong that in order to rebut it, the crime

must be brought home to the accused beyond reasonable doubt”. [The Law of Evidence, volume II,

Book I, page 297-8]

It is indeed a well enshrined and recognized cardinal principle that an accused has the right

to remain silent during the trial. In this case, the Accused - Appellant has exercised that

right. There is no compulsion that may be imposed on an accused to present defence

evidence or to prove his innocence. However, particularly in the backdrop of a prosecution

having proved a minimum of a strong prima facie case against the accused, hiding behind the

32

presumption of innocence and exercising the right to remain silent, if the accused chooses

to remain silent and not offer any evidence, if the circumstances justify, such silence and

absence of evidence in favour of the accused may attract certain consequences in law in the

nature of an adverse inference, and thereby entitle the judge or jury to arrive at certain

adverse findings against such accused.

According to the curses curiae of this Court, on the application of, as well as quite

independent of, the much debated dictum of Lord Ellenborough in Rex v. Lord Cochrane and

others (1814) Gurney’s Reports 479, when the prosecution has established a strong prima facie

case, the continued silence on the part of the accused and his failure to explain incriminatory

items of evidence, which, if the accused is in fact innocent, be well within his power to

explain, would elevate the strong prima facie case to the level of a presumptive case, thereby in

appropriate cases justifying a finding of guilt against the accused. In such circumstances, it

would be lawful and fair for the Court to conclude that the prosecution has proven its case

beyond reasonable doubt. {See Queen v. Sumanasena, [66. NLR 350], Seetin v. The Queen [68

NLR 316], R. v. Seeder de Silva [41 NLR 337], Ilangatilaka v. The Republic [(1984) 2 Sri L.R.

38], Basnayake v. OIC, Special Crimes Detection Unit, Anuradhapura [(1988) 2 Sri L.R. 50], The

Attorney General v. Potta Naufer and Others [(2007) 2 Sri L.R. 144], and Somaratne Rajapakse and

Others vs. Honourable Attorney General [(2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113].}

In the backdrop of all the earlier referred to cogent items of direct and circumstantial

evidence presented by the prosecution, notwithstanding the prosecution having presented

a very strong case against the Appellant, the Appellant did not offer any explanation on his

behalf either by giving evidence or calling witnesses or through both such ways. There was

no attempt by the Appellant to explain any item of evidence presented by the prosecution

against him. The Appellant did not refute the allegation against him by way of evidence. He

did not even attempt to explain the incriminatory items of evidence against him, which were

well within his control to explain, if he was not guilty of having committed the offences

contained in the charge sheet. Thus, taking as a whole the entire body of evidence presented

by the prosecution and the accused’s failure to provide an innocent explanation in respect

of any of those items of evidence, I am of the view that the prosecution has proven its case

33

against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt, and hence the conviction of the Accused -

Appellant is lawful.

Suggestions put to prosecution witnesses

Counsel for the Accused - Appellant has during cross-examination suggested to Professor

Sunil Ariyaratne, that due to a personal animosity he had with the Appellant, he had

submitted to a Police Officer named Lugoda of the Colombo Crimes Division a CD which

he himself had prepared, bribed him, and got a “false case” filed against the Appellant. It has

also been suggested to him that his evidence that they watched the ‘Sarungalaya’ film at the

police station is false, and that they did not watch any film at the police station, and that he

did not identify any production at the police station. Further, it has been suggested that

what was shown to the witness by the police was not what was recovered from the

possession of the Appellant. These suggestions have been vehemently denied by the

witness.

Similarly, a suggestion has been made to witness Raveendra Mahagamasekera. It has been

suggested to this witness that he is not the son of Mahagama Sekera. From the perspective

of this witness’s personal character, this is a very serious allegation to have been made.

Undoubtedly, Raveendra Mahagamasekera would have been insulted, embarrassed and

annoyed by the said suggestion, which he had vehemently denied. In view of Raveendra

Mahagamasekera’s own testimony that he is the son of Mahagama Sekera and the

testimony given by Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and Visharadha Nanda Malini relating to

Raveendra Mahagamasekera, it is overwhelmingly evident that Raveendra

Mahagamasekera is in fact the son of the late well known and much respected lyricist

Mahagama Sekera, and not an imposter. It is also evident that the defence counsel had no

material at all, to establish the truth of such malicious and offensive suggestion, as, if he

had, he would have impeached the testimony given by Raveendra Mahagamasekera using

such material. After Raveendra Mahagamasekera denied the suggestion, the defence

presented no evidence to contradict the witness and thereby assert the truthfulness of his

suggestion.

34

It is necessary to observe that suggestions are in fact a component of a comprehensive cross-

examination. Suggestions are factual assertions or propositions put to a witness during

cross-examination by the counsel conducting such cross-examination, for the purposes of

(i) impeaching the credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of a witness, (ii) attempting

to elicit an item of evidence favourable to the party on whose behalf the cross-examination

is being conducted, such as an admission, (iii) indicating to Court the position of the party

on whose behalf the cross-examination is being conducted, regarding the testimony given

by the particular witness, and (iv) indicating to Court the position of the party on whose

behalf the cross-examination is being conducted, the overall case of the opposing party.

From an ethical perspective, suggestions must necessarily be founded upon instructions

received by the counsel conducting the cross-examination from his client. Professional

ethics of Attorneys require that for the purpose of deciding on the nature of the cross-

examination to be conducted, for counsel not to rely on mere verbal instructions received

from the client, but to examine and assess the veracity of the instructions he receives, prior

to acting on instructions received and making suggestions. In fact, this requirement is not

limited to making suggestions, but to all professional conduct of counsel. Counsel should

not put suggestions to a witness, unless he in good faith believes the contents of such

suggestion to be true. It would be unethical to put suggestions to a witness during cross-

examination, which the counsel himself knows or has reason to believe is false. Thus, in the

administration of justice, there is no room for baseless and ill-founded suggestions being

made. It is the responsibility of Court to prevent the making of baseless suggestions, and if

that is not possible, frown upon the making of such suggestions and where appropriate

initiate disciplinary action against the Attorney-at-Law who acted in violation of this

professional ethic.

In the circumstances, I am compelled to conclude that the question put under cross-

examination containing the afore-stated suggestions, come within the ambit of section 151

and 152 of the Evidence Ordinance which empowers the Court to forbid the asking of

indecent and scandalous questions, and questions aimed at annoying or insulting a witness.

When such a question in the form of a suggestion is put to a witness, it would be desirable

for the trial judge to inquire from counsel whether the Attorney has reasonable grounds for

35

the framing of and making such a suggestion, and an evidential basis to establish the truth

of the contents of such suggestion. On a strict application of the law, in this case, the defence

counsel who appeared on behalf of the accused should have been reported to the Supreme

Court in terms of section 150 of the Evidence Ordinance. Courts of law should not be

permitted to be used as platforms to make wild and sweeping allegations against witnesses,

which cannot be substantiated, and thereby baselessly, unnecessarily and inappropriately

injure the character and reputation of witnesses, harm the witness’s state of mind, and to

bring disrepute to the system of administration of justice.

Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe in “Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers” (Chapter XII)

has stated as follows: “An attorney must not in the course of making submissions or cross-

examining a witness say or lead a witness to say anything that might mislead the court. In particular,

counsel must not make any statement to court or put any proposition to a witness that is

not supported by reasonable instructions, or that lacks factual foundation by reference to

the information available to court. Counsel has a particular responsibility to the court when

cross-examining a witness not to put to the witness allegations in the form of questions which

counsel knows that the witness does not have the necessary information or knowledge to

answer, or where there is no justifiable foundation for the question.” (Emphasis added.)

No suggestion if denied by the witness, would by itself be considered as evidence, or would

be capable of creating a reasonable doubt regarding the testimony of the particular witness,

unless, the truth of the contents of such suggestion is established by way of evidence, or

through a combination of evidence and presumptions, matters in respect of which the Court

may take judicial notice, and inferences which the Court is lawfully entitled to arrive at. In

this case, the defence has neither presented evidence of its own behalf, nor elicited evidence

from prosecution witnesses in proof of any of the suggestions made.

Therefore, I conclude that the above-mentioned suggestions made to Professor Sunil

Ariyaratne and to Raveendra Mahagamsekera, and to the other witnesses who testified for

the prosecution, have not given rise to a reasonable doubt either regarding their respective

credibility or the case for the prosecution. The baseless and frivolous suggestions made to

36

the afore-stated prosecution witnesses by the Attorney-at-Law for the Accused has to be

responded to by this Court by the condemnation his conduct necessarily deserve.

Conclusions

Therefore, I answer the two questions of law in respect of which special leave to appeal was

granted in the following manner:

1. The learned Magistrate and the learned Judge of the High Court have correctly applied the

law with respect to productions marked “P2A”, as the evidence for the prosecution has not

created a reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the said productions.

2. As regards the first and the second counts on the charge sheet, the prosecution has in fact

proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. In the circumstances, the learned Magistrate and

the learned High Court Judge have correctly considered the evidence and concluded the fact

that the prosecution has proved the first and the second charges in the charge sheet beyond

reasonable doubt. However, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have

erred in holding that the prosecution had proved the third count in the charge sheet beyond

reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, I affirm the conviction imposed by the learned Magistrate with regard to the

first and second counts on the indictment.

Sentence

An examination of the journal entries reveals that, following the finding of the accused guilty

of having committed all three offences in the charge sheet and convicting him, the learned

Magistrate has imposed what may be referred to as a ‘composite punishment’ in relation to

the three charges contained in the charge sheet. The scheme of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act and in particular section 16 of the Act envisages that when an accused is

convicted of having committed more than one offence, the High Court Judge or the

Magistrate as the case may be, should impose separate sentences in relation to each of the

offences in respect of which he has been found guilty. That has not been done in this matter.

Thus, the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate is unlawful to that extent.

37

The law relating to intellectual property such as copyrights have been developed for

multiple reasons including the need to protect intellectual property such as original

creations, and confer on the authors of protected works certain rights which would inter-

alia confer on them lasting reputation for their creations as well as financial and commercial

entitlements. Infringement of copyrights negates those objectives and inhibits the growth of

creations. Violation of copyrights is an avenue of illicit business activity, which must be

condemned. The conduct of the Accused – Appellant would have certainly caused financial

loss to the complainants. The Accused – Appellant has for financial gain engaged in selling

pirated copies of music CDs. His conduct has been premediated, well organized, fraudulent,

and carried out with the objectives of unlawful financial gain for himself, and causing

financial loss to the complainants. It has also resulted in depriving the complainants of

legitimate financial gain. I also see no mitigatory circumstances in favour of the Accused

receiving a lenient sentence. In my view, in a matter of this nature involving infringement

of intellectual property rights, the sentence to be imposed should be founded upon the need

to punish the accused for the offence committed, impose deterrence on society, and effect

compensatory relief to the complainants. These are sentencing policies, which should

govern the sentence to be imposed. Taking the afore-stated factors into consideration, the

sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate, in my view is lenient. However, the

prosecution has not appealed and moved the High Court of the Provinces for enhancement

of the sentence. Nevertheless, it is necessary for this Court to ensure the lawfulness of the

sentence imposed.

In the circumstances, I impose a term of 6 months imprisonment suspended for a period of

ten years and a fine of Rs. 5,00,000/= with a default sentence of imprisonment of one year,

per each of the two charges the Accused – Appellant stands convicted of having

committed. The sentences are to run concurrently.

In view of the foregoing, the conviction of the Accused – Appellant with regard to the first

and second counts on the charge sheet are affirmed. The Accused – Appellant is acquitted

with regard to the third count on the charge sheet. Subject thereto, this Appeal is

dismissed.

38

As there is merit in the Appeal in so far as the third count in the charge sheet is concerned,

no order is made as regards costs.
