The Petitioners were allocated 43.5 marks at the interview and the 1st Petitioner was placed at the 33rd position and was included in the provisional list of those who had been selected. The cut off mark for the same was also 43.5 as at the time of provisional list. However, it is apparent that another child, namely the 16th Respondent, who also obtained 43.5 marks was placed at the 32nd position since his residence was in close proximity to the school. Even though, close proximity to school was not a criterion to give marks under the past pupil category, the placement of the 16th Respondent who received the same marks was not challenged by way of an appeal or objections by the Petitioners under clause 10.1 of the circular. As such, placement of the 16th Respondent shall not be allowed to be challenged in this application since the Petitioners did not use their right to appeal or objection as provided by the circular. It is also observed, that the circular does not provide for how should the placement or selection be done when there are many applicants who have received same marks for the last vacancy or when there are limited number of vacancies. Furthermore, this court observes that as per the clause 12.10, the Secretary to the Ministry has been given power to supervise and settle issues that may arise in relation to the enforcement of the circular. Thus, if the Petitioners have met with a problem which is due to the lack of a provision to meet such situation in the circular, they could have referred it to the Secretary to the Ministry for relief when the 16th Respondent was placed before the 1st Petitioner. No such reference has been made to the Secretary by the Petitioners. Moreover, the averments in the Petition does not allege any infringement caused by placing the 16th Respondent above the 1st Petitioner and no relief is sought against the 16th Respondent- vide paragraph 2(i) of the Petition.

On the other hand, when marks are given to the educational qualification gained after leaving the school by the past pupil, and such marks are distributed as per the discretion of the Interview Board (vide Clause 7.3.4 and 7.3.5 of the circular marked E and Clause 6.2 of the guidelines marked P2(b)), and when the certificate itself does not reveal the duration, it appears that it is the duty of the Interview Board to get the duration verified before rejecting to give marks on such certificate since there is no description as to the duration of the course that relates to the said educational qualification either in the circular or the guidelines or in the application marked C2.

When the Interview Board gave 2.5 marks for such contribution, the Interview Board must naturally have an idea with regard to the contribution made by other candidates as they are privy to the other applications, but during the Appeal, when the Appeal Board increased the marks by adding 3 more marks, it is not clear whether the members of the Appeal Board had any idea or comparative view with regard to the contributions made by other candidates. If they increased the marks without any idea about the contributions made by other candidates, especially the candidates whose applications were rejected, it cannot be said that such increase of marks for contribution to the school is justifiable. However, this Court does not have sufficient material to state that the Appeal Board acted wrongfully in that regard. However, none of the documents marked as B2 to B26 shows that the 12th Respondent\u2019s father won any prize for hand writing for 1 mark to be given by the Appeal Board as per B1. Thus, it appears, out of 7.5 marks added by the Appeal Board to the marks of the 12th Respondent, one mark is given without any supporting document. When that one mark is reduced, the 12 Respondent gets only 43 marks which is less than the marks received by the 16th Respondent and the 1st Petitioner. Hence the placement of the 12th Respondent in the 33rd position in the final list cannot be approved and that should have been given to the 16th Respondent and the 1st petitioner\u2019s place should have been the 34th position in the final list.

Hence, even if this court observes some irregularity or wrongful act in giving marks to the 12th Respondent, this Court cannot find any infringement of the Petitioners\u2019 rights by refusing to admit the 1st Petitioner to the said school, since being in 34th place he is not entitled to admission. Since the Petitioners have not challenged the placement of the 16th Petitioner through an appeal or otherwise, this Court cannot be satisfied that the Petitioners have status to file an application on the basis of refusal to admit the 1st Petitioner to the said college. Even though, the Petitioners did not appeal against the placement of the 16th Respondent above the 1st Petitioner in the temporary list and also had stated in the Petition that the 16th and 17 Respondents were added only to give notice to them and no relief is sought against them, now in the written submissions has",

The Petitioners has brought the attention of the Court to Clause 10(3) of the guidelines P2(b) which provides that persons who forwarded the objections, the persons who are subject to objections and the persons who forwarded the appeals will be separately subjected to investigation by the said Appeal Board during the appeal process. The Petitioners further state that the said circular does not provide any opportunity for persons whose names appear in the provisional list, against whom no objections have been raised, to be heard by the Appeal Board, if they are not included in the final list. It is further alleged that there is a breach of natural justice since they were not given any opportunity to assess the validity of the additional marks given to the 12th and 14th Respondents - vide paragraphs 36 to 40 in the Petition. In reply to these paragraphs the 2nd Respondent in his affidavit in objections state that the procedure as set out in the circular was followed.",

    "text": "In this regard it should be noted that the Circular No.22/2017 marked E states in paragraph 12.1.2 that in the event, children who became eligible as per the temporary list become ineligible due to the appeals and objections made to the Appeal Board, the parents of those children must be summoned before the Appeal Board and only after their eligibility is inquired into, the final decision should be made by the Appeal Board. Thus, the Circular provides an opportunity for the children who are listed at the tail end of the provisional list and who may lose their opportunity to get admissions, to get their marks re- evaluated, when there is a risk of losing admissions. As such, there is no need for a legitimate expectation in a purported lacuna of provisions for remedy in the circular for such a situation but there is an express provision giving an opportunity to be heard by the board. In an administrative process for selection, one cannot expect to give an opportunity to a party to cross-examine or challenge others\u2019 documents like in a trial before a court house. The position of the contesting Respondents is that they followed the procedure set out in the Circular. This Court cannot find fault with the 3 marks given to the 14th Respondent even after the Petitioners placed",

In that backdrop, 33rd position should have been given to the 16th Respondent. As there are only 33 vacancies, it is the view of the Court that the Petitioners cannot complain as of a right that the 1st Petitioner was eligible to be admitted to the Kingswood College. As such, the refusal to admit the 1st Petitioner to Kingswood College cannot be considered as an infringement of the Fundamental rights of the Petitioners.",
