P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner, filed the Petition pertaining to the instant application in this Court on

18-07-2014, praying inter alia, for;

i. leave to proceed under Article 11, 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the constitution;

ii. a declaration that the 1st Respondent/all the Respondents and/or the state has

infringed or has been in continuous infringement of the fundamental rights

guaranteed to the petitioner under Article 11, 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the

Constitution;

iii. compensation of Five Million Rupees (Rs. 5,000,000/=).

This Court on 13-10-2014, having heard the submissions of the learned counsel for

the Petitioner, had decided to grant leave to proceed in respect of the alleged

violations of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

When the matter was taken up for argument on 15-03-2021, the learned Senior State

Counsel raised a Preliminary Objection against the maintainability of this application

on the basis that the application of the Petitioner has been filed out of time provided

by law.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner sought to counter that argument by stating that

the complained acts by the 1st Respondent were continuous infringements.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 3 of 11

Although the Petitioner in his petition, has alleged infringements of fundamental rights

guaranteed to him under Article 11, 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the Constitution,1 this Court,

as has been already mentioned above, has granted leave to proceed only in respect

of the alleged infringements of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Out of the averments in the petition, one can observe that the petitioner has alleged

only the following instances as acts of infringement by the 1st Respondent.

i. The 1st Respondent who was an Assistant Superintendent of Police in

Nugegoda Police Division, has sent a Police message,2 to Hettipola Police

Station to inform the petitioner to appear before him at 10.30 AM on 24th

October 2013.

ii. The 1st Respondent on 24th October 2013 (presumably after the Petitioner had

appeared before him consequent to the above message), had allowed the

management of Nilkem (pvt) Ltd. to question and harass the Petitioner.

iii. When the Petitioner attended the 1st Respondents office on 24th October 2013,

the 1st Respondent had harassed and made demands from the Petitioner

without taking down any proper complaint by anybody.

iv. The 1st Respondent on 24th October 2013 had obtained the signature of the

petitioner to a document containing eight pages and forced the Petitioner to

pay Rs. 942,214.13 to Nilkem (pvt) Ltd. without affording an opportunity to

explain what actually had happened. 3

v. The 1st Respondent has again summoned the Petitioner on 07th November

2013 and insisted that the Petitioner must pay the alleged sum of money due

to Nilkem (pvt) Ltd.4

vi. The 1st Respondent has again sent a Police message,5 informing the Petitioner

to come to his office at 10.30 AM on 05th December 2013.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 4 of 11

vii. The 1st Respondent has sent another Police message,6 to Hettipola Police

Station to inform the Petitioner to come to his office at 11.00 AM on 12th

December 2013.

viii. On or about 12th December 2013, the 1st Respondent had demanded the

Petitioner to withdraw the case filed by the Petitioner in the District Labour

office Kuliyapitiya and the complaint lodged at the Police Station Hettipola. He

had also threatened to file criminal proceedings against the Petitioner if he

ignores the said demands.7 According to the Petitioner, this was despite the

Petitioner proving before the 1st Respondent that he had already settled all the

monies due to Nilkem (pvt) Ltd.8

ix. On or about 22nd December 2013, on the instructions of the 1st Respondent,

Nilkem (pvt) Ltd had lodged complaints at the Special Investigation Unit

Nugegoda. Consequently, the Petitioner had to appear in the Special

Investigation Unit - Nugegoda on 07th January 2014. 9

x. On 07th January 2014, the 1st Respondent had arranged the petitioner to go to

Hettipola Police Station accompanied by P C 30674 Priyankara to bring back a

Motor cycle to Colombo. The Petitioner, after bringing and handing over the

said motor cycle to Mirihana Police Station, was arrested and produced before

the Magistrate who had enlarged the Petitioner on bail.10

According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent through the above acts, has infringed

the fundamental rights guaranteed to him under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. The

Petitioner has stated in his petition that the above acts are continuing infringements.11

The Petitioner has filed the instant application on 18-07-2014. The latest alleged act

of infringement, according to the petition, had occurred on the 07th January 2014.

Thus, the Petitioner has filed the instant application more than six months after the

aforesaid latest alleged act of infringement.

6 Produced marked as P-4. 7 Paragraph 25 of the petition. 8 Paragraph 21 of the petition. 9 Paragraph 26 of the petition. 10 Paragraphs 27 and 28 of the petition. 11 Paragraph 29 of the petition.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 5 of 11

Next question to be considered is whether the alleged infringements are continuing

infringements as alleged by the learned counsel for the petitioner. According to the

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent who was an Assistant Superintendent of Police in

Nugegoda Police Division, has allegedly violated his fundamental rights, by sending

several Police messages informing him to come to the 1st Respondents office, by

threatening, by harassing, by demanding certain acts to be done and finally by

arresting and producing him before Nugegoda Magistrate. The final act had occurred

on 07th January 2014. The Petitioner does not allege any act, attributable to the 1st

Respondent, as having occurred thereafter. At its least, there is no material before

Court even to ascertain whether the 1st Respondent, during the period of more than

six months after 07th January 2014, in fact continued to be an Assistant Superintendent

of Police in Nugegoda Police Division. Moreover, it must be noted that the Petitioner

has only made allegations of violations against the 1st Respondent. In the above

circumstances, and having regard to the nature of the acts of infringements alleged

against the 1st Respondent, I am of the view that the acts of infringements alleged by

the Petitioner in his petition, had not continued after 07th January 2014. Therefore,

the said alleged acts cannot be identified as continuing infringements as alleged by

the learned counsel for the petitioner.

There is yet another question to be considered. That is the question of applicability of

provisions in section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21

of 1996. This is because the Petitioner has averred in his petition that he had lodged

a complaint dated 21st January 2014, at the Human Rights Commission under the No.

HRC/299/14. The Petitioner has produced, marked P-6, a receipt issued by the Human

Rights Commission.

Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 is as

follows.

where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14, to the

Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement

of a fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the period within

which the inquiry into such complaint is pending 12 before the Commission,

12 Emphasis added.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 6 of 11

shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one month within which an

application may be made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126

(2) of the Constitution.

What section 13 (1) states is, not to take, the period within which the inquiry into a

complaint is pending before the Commission, into account, for the purpose of

computing the period of one month referred to in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

I only find a bare averment in the petition of a fact that he had lodged a complaint at

the Human Rights Commission. The receipt issued by the Human Rights Commission

produced marked P-6, only shows the fact that a complaint had been made.

In the case of H K Subasinghe Vs The Inspector General of Police and seven others,13

the learned State Counsel raised a preliminary objection that the petitioner in that

case had not made the complaint of the alleged infringements within the period of

one month as provided in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. Having considered the

submissions, His Lordship S N Silva Chief Justice stated as follows.

The Petitioner seeks to bring the complaint within the time limit on the basis that he

made the complaint to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka within the

stipulated time. In this regard the petitioner relies on section 31 (sic) 14 the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 which provides that where a

complaint has been made within a period of one month to the Human Rights

Commission, the period within which the inquiry into such complaint was pending

before the Commission will not be taken into account in computing the period within

which an application should be filled in this Court.

The petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence that there has been an inquiry

pending before Human Rights Commission. In the circumstances, we have to uphold

the preliminary objection raised by learned State Counsel.

In the case of Ranaweera and others Vs Sub Inspector Wilson Siriwardena and

others,15 the second preliminary objection raised by the respondents in that application

13 SC (spl) No.16/1999, decided on 11-09-2000. 14 Section 13 appears to have been inadvertently typed as section 31 in this judgment. 15 2008 (1) SLR 260.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 7 of 11

is that the petitioners' application had been filed out of time. The petitioners in that

application, relied on an averment in their petition that they had made a complaint to

the Human Rights Commission within one month from the date of the acts resulting

in the alleged violation of the petitioners' fundamental rights. Like in the instant case,

the petitioners in that application, had produced a receipt issued by the Human Rights

Commission acknowledging their complaint.

His Lordship Justice Gamini Ameratunga followed the decision in Subasinghes case16

and stated as follows.

It is very clear from the section quoted above that the mere act of making a complaint

to the Human Rights Commission is not sufficient to suspend the running of time

relating to the time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

In terms of the said section 13(1), the period of time to be excluded in computing the

period of one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution is "the period

within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the Commission.

Section 14 of the Human Rights Commission Act (in so far as it is relevant to the

present purpose) reads as follows. "The Commission may .......... on a complaint made

to it by an aggrieved person investigate an allegation of an infringement or imminent

infringement of a fundamental right of any person ....."

Thus the Human Rights Commission is not legally obliged to hold an investigation into

every complaint received by it regarding the alleged violation of a fundamental right.

Therefore a party seeking to utilize section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission

Act to contend that "the period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending

before the Commission shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one

month within which an application may be made to the Supreme Court" is obliged to

place material before this Court to show that an inquiry into his complaint is pending

before the Human Rights Commission.

This is the view taken by this Court in the case of Subasinghe v the Inspector General

of Police. 17 In that case the petitioner sought to invoke section 13(1) of the Human

16 Supra. 17 Supra.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 8 of 11

Rights Commission Act to claim exemption from the time limit set out in Article 126 of

the Constitution. In that case My Lord the Chief Justice has held that the petitioner

has to adduce some evidence to show that there has been an inquiry pending before

the Human Rights Commission into his complaint. In the absence of any such material

placed before Court by the petitioner, the objection relating to the time bar was

upheld.

The Petitioner in his written submissions has relied on the case of Romesh Cooray Vs

Jayalath, Sub-Inspector of Police and others.18 The 6th respondent in that case, had

contended that the alleged infringement of the fundamental rights by the 1st to 6th

respondents in that case had taken place on 06.07.2003, whereas the application of

the petitioner in that case had been filed only on 11.12.2003. it was on that basis that

the said 6th Respondent had contended that the said application had not been made

within one month from the alleged infringement, as required by Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution.

Her Ladyship Justice Shirani Bandaranayake19 rejected the contention of the said 6th

Respondent, for two main reasons. The first reason is that the 6th respondent had not

raised the said preliminary objection either in his objections or in the written

submissions. It appears that the said 6th respondent had taken the said objection

belatedly and after all the Court pleadings were completed. It was in that background

that Her Ladyship stated the following.

Accordingly on a consideration of the aforementioned Rules, it is evident that a

preliminary objection should be raised at the time the objections are filed and/or

should be referred to in the written submissions that has to be tendered in terms of

the Rules. The objective of this procedure is quite easy to comprehend. The whole

purpose of objections and written submissions is to place their case by both parties

before Court prior to the hearing and when the petitioner's objections are taken along

with the objections and/or written submissions filed by the respondents prior to the

hearing, it would not come as a surprise either to the affected parties or to Court and

the applications could be heard without prejudice to any one's rights. Therefore, as

18 2008 (2) SLR 43. 19 As she then was.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 9 of 11

correctly pointed out by the learned President's Counsel for the petitioner, the earliest

opportunity the 6th respondent had of raising the aforementioned preliminary

objection was at the time of filing his objections and written submissions in terms of

the Supreme Court Rules, 1990; as the objections and/or the written submissions

should have contained any statement of fact and/or issue of law that the 6th

respondent intended to raise at the hearing.

The second reason for rejecting the said 6th Respondents argument regarding the

time bar is because the petitioner in that case had adduced material to satisfy Court

that the inquiry before the Human Rights Commission had been still pending. This is

clear from the following excerpt from Her Ladyships judgment.

.. Admittedly, the petitioner had complained to the Human Rights Commission

about the said infringements on 08.07.2003. The petitioner in paragraph 47 of his

petition dated 11.12.2003 clearly stated thus:

"The petitioner states that he has made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission

on 08th July 2003 against the aforesaid unlawful conduct of the respondents and the

inquiry in respect of the same is pending in the Human Rights Commission. The

petitioner annexes hereto a copy of the letter issued by the Human Rights Commission

marked P 11 in proof thereof. "

The document marked P 11 is issued by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka,

which refers to the complaint made on behalf of the petitioner on 08.07.2003.

Accordingly, a complaint had been made to the Human Rights Commission within one

month from the date of the alleged incident. .

. Considering the aforementioned circumstances, it is clear that the petitioner had

complied with the provisions laid down in Section 13(1) of the Human Rights

Commission Act and had complained to the Human Rights Commission within one

month of the alleged infringement of his fundamental rights. Further, when he had

filed the present application before this Court on 11.12.2003, the inquiry before the

Human Rights Commission had been still pending.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 10 of 11

In the circumstances, it is quite clear that the petitioner had filed his application before

this Court within the stipulated time frame in terms of Article 126(2) of the

Constitution.

The Petitioner in the instant application has also placed reliance on the case of Amura

Deshapriya Alles and another Vs Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western

Province and others.20 His Lordship Justice Marsoof PC had rejected the objection of

time bar in that case for the reasons similar to those in Romesh Coorays21 case.

Moreover, it is clear from the following passage from the judgment of His Lordship

Justice Marsoof PC in that case, that the Human Rights Commission after conducting

an inquiry into the complaint made by the relevant petitioner, had even proceeded to

make a recommendation as well. The relevant passage is reproduced below.

It is admitted that even when the Petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of this Court

in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution on 8th June 2009, the said complaint was

pending before the said Commission, which made its recommendations as provided in

the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 on 30th November 2009

(X4) ..

In the instant case, the 1st Respondent in his affidavit, has specifically raised the

preliminary objection against the maintainability of this application on the basis that

the application of the Petitioner has been filed out of time provided by law. Thus, the

Petitioner was put on notice that this preliminary objection would be raised at the

argument of the case. However, the Petitioner has neither taken any further step nor

adduced any further material to counter the said objection. It is thereafter, that the

learned Senior State Counsel when this case was taken up for argument at the very

commencement, raised the same objection as a preliminary issue.

The Petitioner in the instant case, has neither adduced any evidence to show that

there has been an inquiry pending before the Human Rights Commission nor made

any attempt to explain the long delay in filing this application.

[SC (FR) 216/2014] - Page 11 of 11

In the above circumstances, it is apparent that there is no merit in the submissions

made by the learned counsel for the Petitioner.

Thus, for the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the Petitioner has failed to file the

instant application within one-month time period specified in Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution. Therefore, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned

Senior State Counsel and proceed to dismiss this application without costs.
