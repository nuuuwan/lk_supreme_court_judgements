The Petitioner, by her petition filed in this court, alleges that her Fundamental

Rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 12(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have

been violated by the Respondents. This court by its order dated 13.1.2016, granted

leave to proceed for alleged violation of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution. The case of the Petitioner may be briefly summarized as follows. The

Petitioner who passed the GCE (Ordinary Level) with five distinctions in the year

2000 and the GCE (Advanced Level) with two credit passes and one simple pass in

the year 2003, was appointed as Management Assistant in the Department of

SC FR 418/2015

5

Irrigation on contract basis with effect from 21.5.2008 by letter signed by the 1st

Respondent dated 7.5.2008. This letter dated 7.5.2008 is annexed to the Petition

marked as P3. Thereafter her services were extended till 31.12.2014 by letters

marked P4(i) to P4(vi). Thereafter, the Petitioner, by letter dated 17.11.2014

marked as P8, was appointed by the 1st Respondent to the post of clerk with effect

from 24.10.2014 acting in terms of Circular No.25/2014 dated 12.11.2014 marked

P6. The Petitioner states that she has fulfilled the requirements stated in the said

Circular. After the Petitioner assumed duties as a clerk, she was paid salaries from

January 2015 to August 2015 on the salary scale stated in the said letter of

appointment marked P8 dated 17.11.2014. Her salary scale was, according to P8, is

as follows.

MN1-2006-A. Rs 13,120 – 10x145 – 11x170 -10x240 – 10x320 – 22040.

However, by letter (marked P11) issued by the 1st Respondent in August 2015 (the

date is not stated in the said letter), the Petitioner’s appointment to the post of clerk

was cancelled by the1st Respondent with effect from 17.11.2014 which is the date

of the letter of appointment marked P8. The letter of cancelling the Petitioner’s

appointment was handed over to the Petitioner by letter dated 8.9.2015 marked

P12. Thus, she was not permitted to report for duty with effect from 8.9.2015. The

Petitioner challenges both P11 and P12 and moves to quash the said letters.

The learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) contended that the Petitioner was not

entitled to be appointed to the post of clerk in terms of Circular No.25/2014 dated

12.11.2014 marked P6 since the said Circular (P6) had authorized to appoint

Management Assistants to the permanent cadre only if they (Management

Assistants) were drawing the salary scale of MN1. The learned SSC contended that

the Petitioner was not on the salary scale of MN1 but on the salary scale of MN2.

SC FR 418/2015

6

The Petitioner, as Management Assistant on contract basis, was drawing a salary of

Rs.13,990 which, according to R3 produced by the 1st Respondent, is MN2. R3 is a

document which indicates the salary scale of MN2. The salary scale of MN1

according to P8, is Rs.13,120. The learned SSC contended that the Petitioner was

not entitled to be appointed to the permanent cadre since she was drawing the

salary scale of MN2. According to the contention of the learned SSC, if the

Petitioner was drawing a salary of Rs.13,120/-, she was entitled to be appointed to

the permanent cadre. The difference of the salary was only (13,990 – 13,120)

Rs.870/-. In fact, the Petitioner was drawing a higher salary than MN1 scale.

Assuming without conceding that the Petitioner was not entitled to be appointed to

the post of clerk (the permanent cadre) in terms of Circular No.25/2014 dated

12.11.2014 marked P6, who appointed the Petitioner to the post of clerk

(permanent cadre)? It is the Director General of Irrigation (the 1st Respondent) who

appointed the Petitioner to the permanent cadre acting on behalf of the

Government. Then as contended by the learned SSC if it is a mistake, whose

mistake was it? It was the mistake of 1st Respondent who acted on behalf of the

Government. The Petitioner cannot be and should not be penalized for the mistake

committed by the 1st Respondent. It is an accepted principle in law that no man is

permitted to take advantage of his own mistake. This view is supported by the

observation made by His Lordship Justice Sansoni in the case of Kanapathipillai

Vs Meerasaibo 58 NLR page41 at page 43 wherein His Lordship observed thus

“no man is allowed to take advantage of his wrong.” In the present case, the

Petitioner’s appointment to the post of clerk (permanent cadre) was cancelled on

the basis of an alleged mistake committed by the Director General of Irrigation (the

1st Respondent) who acted on behalf of the Government. On this ground alone this

SC FR 418/2015

7

court should quash the letters marked P11 and P12. Further there is no any

allegation that the Petitioner committed any wrongful act.

The other matter that I would like to consider is whether the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation in continuing in the permanent cadre of the Government

Service until her age of retirement. I now advert to this question. The Petitioner

was appointed to the post of clerk with effect from 24.10.2014 by the Director

General of Irrigation (the 1st Respondent) by his letter dated 17.11.2014 (P8). The

letter of appointment (P8) states that this post is permanent and pensionable. Her

salary was Rs.13,120/-. The Government paid her salary (Rs.13,120/-) on the basis

that she has been appointed to the post of clerk for eight months and remitted

Rs.870/- monthly to the W&OP. This is established by her salary slips marked as

P10(i) to P10(viii). The Petitioner gave up her post of Management Assistant on

contract basis when she was appointed to the new post. Presently, the Petitioner

has lost her earlier post of Management Assistant and her new post of clerk. The

Petitioner faces this situation due to the action of the 1st Respondent. When I

consider all the above matters, I ask the question whether the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation of continuing in the permanent cadre of the Government

Service. In this connection I would like to consider certain judicial decisions. In the

case of Dayaratne and Others Vs Minister of Health [1999] 1SLR 393 this court

observed the following facts.

By notification in the Gazette dated 10.05.1996 the Ministry of Health called

for applications from persons desirous of following a course of training

leading to the award of the certificate of competency as Assistant Medical

Officers. Fifteen petitioners who were eligible for enrolment to follow the

course of training applied in response to the notification and sat a

competitive examination conducted on 27.12.1996; and they were so placed

SC FR 418/2015

8

on the results of the examination as to be qualified to follow the course of

training. According to the scheme published in the Gazette, the next step was

the holding of an interview to check the qualifications, meaning the checking

of (1) the birth certificate, (2) evidence of citizenship, and (3) certificates

relating to educational qualifications. That interview was not held. Then, on

18.12.1997 the Secretary, Government Medical Officers' Association

(GMOA) informed the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine that they

desired the provision of employment to medical graduates and saw no

justification 'to restart the AMP training course'; and that their members

'would not participate in any component of the training programme'.

Whereupon, on 11.03.1998 the Minister sought cabinet approval to fill the

existing and future vacancies in the cadre of Assistant Medical Practitioners

with Medical Graduates and to offer the petitioners the option of following

the course for paramedical services/Public Health Inspectors, if they so

desire; and by a circular letter dated 20.08.1998, the petitioners were

invited to apply for training as Pharmacists, Medical Laboratory

Technologists and Public Health Inspectors. The requisite qualifications for

such training and the course subjects are less than what are required for the

AMP course. Besides, persons serving in Para Medical Services and as

Public Health Inspectors are not eligible to seek registration under the

Medical Ordinance to practise medicine and surgery whilst Assistant

Medical Practitioners are eligible to seek such registration, subject to

certain conditions.

This court held as follows. “On the facts of the case, the petitioners had a

legitimate expectation that they would, upon satisfying prescribed conditions, be

provided with a course of training for the examination leading to the award of the

SC FR 418/2015

9

certificate of competency as Assistant Medical Practitioners. The decision effecting

a change of policy which destroyed the expectation of the petitioners did not

depend upon considerations of public interest. In deciding upon the conflicting

interests of Graduate Medical Officers and Assistant Medical Practitioners, the

1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents (the Minister, his Secretary and the Deputy Director

General Administration, respectively) considered the views of the GMOA and

yielded to their pressure. Neither the views of the Assistant Medical Practitioners

nor those of the petitioners were sought. Hence, rights of the petitioners

guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution were violated.” At page 413, this

court whilst holding that the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed by

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been violated made the following

observation. “It is the duty of this Court to safeguard the rights and privileges, as

well as interests "deserving of protection such as those based on legitimate

expectations, of individuals.”

In the case of Sirimal and Others Vs Board of Directors of the Co-operative

Wholesale Establishment and Others [2003] 2 SLR 23 this court observed the

following facts.

“The petitioners complained that the 1st respondent ('The CWE") did in

violation of their rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution stopped

extension of their services beyond 55 years and purported to retire them

from 31.7.2002, by circular dated 21.6.2002(P6). The previous circular

dated 14.11.1995(P5) provided for granting of annual extension from 55

until 60 as in the case of the public sector under Chapter V section 5 of the

Establishments Code. The reasons given for the new policy decision were:

(a) Redundant labour force

SC FR 418/2015

10

(b) Heavy losses; and

(c) Reorganization of the CWE to make it a profit making organization.

The applications of all petitioners except Nos. 19 and 20 were

recommended by the Service Extension Committee; and no application was

sent to the Ministry for decision. The previous practice was to grant annual

extension up to 60 years except where medical or disciplinary grounds

existed.

This court held as follows.

1. The optional age of retirement in the CWE had been 55 years of

age with a right to seek extension up to 60 years of age as in the public sector.

The impugned circular seeks to make retirement compulsory at 55 years.

2. The petitioner had a legitimate expectation of receiving extension up to 60

years except where medical or disciplinary grounds were present.

In Surangani Marapana Vs Bank of Ceylon [1997] 3 SLR 156 this court observed

the following facts.

“The petitioner had an unblemished record of 25 years of service at the

Bank of Ceylon. She was fully qualified and had received special training in

Banking Law and practice and allied subjects in London, Italy and

Singapore. She was the Chief Legal Office of the Bank from 1.11.88 during

which period she had enhanced the efficiency and streamlined the functions

of the Legal Department. As she was to reach the age of 55 years on

27.11.96 she applied to the Bank on 25.5.96 for an extension of service for

an initial period of one year. Her application was recommended by the

SC FR 418/2015

11

Personnel Department in its draft Board Minute, under exceptional

circumstances. The Board of Directors took four months to decide on the

application and after lapse of a further month, the petitioner was informed

on 22.10.96 that her application had been rejected and she would be retired

from 27.11.96. Officers who were of a comparable grade had been granted

extensions. But she was refused for no reason. The Board failed to submit to

Court its decision. The Chairman of the Bank stated in his affidavit that the

refusal to extend her services was done bona fide and unanimously after a

careful evaluation of her application and the need of the Bank to increase

the efficiency of its Legal Department.”

This court at page 171 held as follows.

“The decision of the Board of Directors not to grant the extension of service

sought by the petitioner was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and unfair. It was

also undoubtedly discriminatory, as the bank has not been evenhanded in the

exercise of its discretion in respect of the petitioner. The impugned decision is,

therefore, violative of the petitioner's fundamental right to equality before the law

and the equal protection of the law, enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution.”

At page 172 the court made the following observation. “As the petitioner has

succeeded in her application, I direct the 1st respondent to restore her to the post

of Chief Legal Officer forthwith, for a period of one year from 27.11.96, together

with all back wages and other remuneration.”

In Pinnawala Vs Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation [1997] 3 SLR 85, this court

observed the following facts. “The petitioners‟ application for the third extension

of his services after he had reached 55 years of age was refused by the employer

company on the ground that he was found wanting in the discharge of his duties.”

SC FR 418/2015

12

This court at page 92 held that the 1st respondent is a „governmental agency or

instrumentality‟ and the impugned act properly falls within the meaning of the

expression „executive or administrative action‟ in Article 126 of the Constitution.

The petitioner is accordingly entitled to a declaration that the fundamental right

guaranteed to him under Article 12(1) has been infringed”.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation to continue in the permanent cadre of Government Service

until the date of her retirement.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution states as follows. “All persons are equal before

the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.”

Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution states as follows. “Every citizen is entitled to

the freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any lawful

occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise;”

Considering all the above matters, I hold that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated by

the Director General of Irrigation (the 1st Respondent) who acted on behalf of the

Government. For the above reasons, I quash the letter issued by the 1st Respondent

dated August 2015 marked P11 (the letter does not indicate a date) cancelling the

Petitioner’s appointment and the letter of the 1st Respondent dated 8.9.2015

marked P12 relating to the Petitioner. For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that

the Petitioner is entitled to be in the permanent cadre of Government Service on

conditions stipulated in her letter of appointment dated 17.11.2014 marked P8 from

24.10.2014. I direct the Director General of Irrigation to permit the Petitioner to

continue in the permanent cadre of Government Service on conditions stipulated in

SC FR 418/2015

13

her letter of appointment dated 17.11.2014 marked P8 from the day that she was

stopped from reporting for duty. The Petitioner is entitled to receive her salary as

stipulated in her letter of appointment dated 17.11.2014 marked P8 and all other

remunerations from the date of appointment to the post of clerk. The 1st

Respondent is also directed to pay her back wages and other remunerations from

the date that she was stopped from reporting for duty. The present Director General

of Irrigation is directed to implement the directions given in this judgment within

two months from the date of this judgment. I grant a sum of Rs.50,000/- as

compensation. The 1st Respondent should pay the aforementioned compensation

from the State funds. The Registrar of this court is directed to send a certified copy

of this judgment to the Director General of Irrigation.
