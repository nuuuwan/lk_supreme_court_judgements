However, the aforesaid petition and the contents of the order dated 05.06 2002 indicate that the said settlement made on 27.11.2000 was limited to the demarcation of the common boundary and the rest of the dispute remained to be solved.

Even though, the plaintiffs also wanted to get the common boundary fixed by putting up a retention wall at the expense of the defendants which was not granted, the relief granted by the learned district judge is more in accordance with the relief prayed in the prayer \u2018c\u2019 of the amended answer dated 02.10 2003. In the appeal made to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kandy by the plaintiff, the learned district judge\u2019s judgment was confirmed subject to the variation which expressed the opinion of court that, if the parties are interested in the wellbeing of the two properties, both parties should bear the cost of building up the retaining wall on the common boundary. Since the said variation added by the High Court is an expression of an opinion subject to the phrase \u2018if the parties are interested\u2019 it cannot be enforced through a decree unless the parties are willing and interested in putting up a wall. As such the variation added by the High Court has no practical effect. In that sense, the High Court Judgment, as said before, only confirms the district court Judgment with an additional opinion which cannot be put into effect without the consent of the parties. It must be noted that it was only the plaintiffs who have prayed to build a retention wall at the expense of the defendants and the defendants\u2019 prayer was to demarcate the common boundary but without any prayer to put up a wall. Hence, the prayers do not indicate that both parties are interested in putting up a wall through a court order. However, proceedings recorded at the trial indicate that the defendants were willing to put up a wall at the expense of both the parties.",

In other words, even though, the plaintiffs challenge the acceptance of plan no.4006 through the said question of law and rely on the plan no.2360 made by B. P. Rupasinghe L.

It is apparent that the learned district judge has not given detailed reasons for not accepting the aforesaid plan no. 2360 which the plaintiffs argue as the one that shows the correct boundary. Even in the high court judgment, no reason is given for not preferring plan no.2360 over plan no. 4006.

This was the plan made on a joint commission. As per this plan and paragraph 7(iii) of the report Palamakumbura L.S. has used 9 fixation points for the superimposition of plan no.194 including two fixation points situated on the corners of a house found to the east of Uduwela - Kandy high road even in plan 194. Like in Mawalagedara\u2019s plan, superimposition in this plan no.4006 also appears to have taken into more details such as setting of 12 feet wide road way and the setting of the high road in its superimposition when compared to the plan no. 2360 of B.P. Rupasinghe. Palamakumbara, L.S in his report has explained that to decide the positioning of the common boundary he surveyed the other necessary details in plan no.194. Like with the B.P Rupasinghe, L.S plan and report, it is not mentioned what type of copy of the plan no.194 was used for superimposition but, as this was a joint commission, it is probable that he was provided with the original copy marked by the defendants. Since the factual position indicates that he used several fixation points as described above and other details in the plan no. 194, it is more probable that the accuracy of superimposition in the plan made by Palamakumbura L.S. more acceptable than that of plan made by B.P. Rupasinghe, L.S. Further as observed by the learned district judge, plan no.4006 of Palamakumbura L.S. was made on a joint commission pursuant a settlement to demarcate the common boundary. The plaintiffs have not given any reason as to why they wanted to withdraw from the agreement. It may be for the reason that, after the survey, they found that the common boundary lies not on the place they want but on a place that benefits the defendants. Hence, even though the learned district judge or the learned high court judges have not given reasons in detail as to why they did not accept B.P. Rupasinghe, L.S.\u2019s plan, the factual situation as described above does not warrant an interference of this court to change the decision with regard to the plan that should be used in deciding the location of the common boundary. On the other hand, as said before, the prayers to the petition does not ask for a relief to set aside or vary the district court judgment except for a judgment to state that the defendants are responsible for the deterioration of the common boundary and they should bear the cost of the retaining wall. Thus, the question of law no.4 raised at the support stage has to be answered in favour of the defendants.",

As a matter of law, it is true that a land owner has a right to have lateral support from the adjacent lands. The need to have this lateral support from the land below may be much stronger when the adjoining lands are situated along a gradient or different level. Referring to Bandappuhamy Vs Swamy Pillai (1950) 52 N L R 234, Thurston V Hancock 12 Mass 220, Lasala V Holbrook, 4 Paige Ch 169(1833), the plaintiffs argue that this entitlement to lateral support is a natural right.

He also specifically has answered that between the wall of the old building and disputed embankment, no new building has been constructed - vide pages 1666 and 169 of the brief. Thus, it is clear that if any building or renovation has been done by the defendants on the side where the common boundary exists, it has been done within the limits of the old house. In certain occasions this witness has attempted to introduce defendants\u2019 buildings as unauthorized structures but at page 170 of the brief he has admitted that the relevant laws for approved plans came into force in 1983 in the towns and 1991 in the village areas and he does not know when the old building shown in P2 plan was built. This indicate that his evidence is not sufficient even to say that the house that was there when the defendants bought the land was an unauthorized structure. Whatever it is, as per his evidence, there is nothing to say that it was the defendants who excavated or removed soil from the embankment.",

    "text": "B.P Rupasinghe, L.S. also has given evidence for the plaintiff with regard to the preparation of his plan no. 2360 and the observations he made. He attempts to indicate that the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 buildings and the soil erosion at lot 2 in his plan is due to the construction of part of the house shown as \u2018F\u2019 in his plan (vide page186 of the brief), but paragraph 4 of his report indicates that this was what the plaintiff told him. At page 188 of the brief, he suggests to put up a protective wall to reduce the threat of soil erosion caused by excavating inclined area but there also he expresses that the plaintiffs had stated that excavation of soil from the inclined area was done for the building of the part marked as F in his plan. Thus, it is clear he was not expressing his own opinion as to cutting down of soil in the slanted area between lot 2 and \u201cF\u201d in his plan, but expressing what he was told by the plaintiffs. However, his evidence at page 205 of the brief indicates that lot 2 is an area where soil was eroded with the flowing of water. This supports the stance taken by the defendants that soil that came with flowing of water was gathered against their rear wall damaging it and they only removed that soil and built that part, since even the part of building marked as \u2018F\u2019 in the said plan does not protrude beyond the other portion of the rear wall. It appears that \u2018F\u2019 has been built within the limits of the existing building. As such it is hard to believe that the defendants had to remove soil from the supporting embankment for the building of \u201cF\u201d other than removing the soil gathered against his wall. Even though, this witness had stated in paragraph 5 of his report marked X1, that cutting out of soil vertically on the area where the common boundary has caused the soil erosion, it is not sufficient to decide that the defendants are liable for it as the house made by their predecessors in title was there when they bought it, and the bank between the two lands would have been created for such construction. This situation is well explained by the Mawalagedara L.S when he gave evidence for the defendants while submitting the plan and report made by him. As per his report and evidence, both parties have built their houses by",

He has also explained that there was no other alternative to prepare the lands for building due to the inclination of the area in its natural setting. This clarify if there was any cutting out of soil making vertical embankments or near vertical embankments, it would have taken place at the time the plaintiffs or the predecessors of defendants made their houses. He further has expressed that the damages caused to the plaintiffs\u2019 buildings has resulted due to the unsteadiness of the filled area as it has sunk. He opines that if it was due to the cutting out or loosening of soil in the embankment, it would have first caused damages to the retention wall that exists in between.

He has also observed a ditch/trench marked as H, H1, F2and C1 in his plan which carry rain water and waste water from the plaintiffs\u2019 land towards the lower area.

However, if the nature of the upper land has been changed to built houses or ditch or trench is constructed for the flow of water one may not be able to argue that the change of flow of water resulting due to such facts is still a flow in the ordinary course. Anyhow, in the case at hand, there is no injunction against the plaintiffs by the lower courts or a cross appeal made by the defendants for not giving such permanent injunction.",
