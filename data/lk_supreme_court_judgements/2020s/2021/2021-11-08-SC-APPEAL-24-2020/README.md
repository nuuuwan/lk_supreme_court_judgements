A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

this action in the District Court of Negombo against the Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) and prayed, inter-alia, to grant a declaration that

the Plaintiff is the owner of the land more fully described in the 1st schedule to the Plaint,

to grant an order declaring that the Plaintiff has acquired a prescriptive right to dispose

water accumulating in his land, across the land more fully described in the 2nd schedule to

flow down to Muthurajawela, to grant an enjoining order and an interim injunction

preventing the Defendant filling soil in the land described in the 2nd schedule.

The Defendants position is that he cultivates Gotu Kola for export and therefore, a top

layer of soil was necessary to be added for cultivation purposes.

The learned District Judge by order dated 03/02/2009, issued an interim order preventing

the Defendant from filling soil on the land until the final determination of this action.

The Plaintiff has obtained several Commissions to survey the land in question and the

resultant plans and commission reports tendered to Court are filed of record. On

20/10/2009, the Plaintiff made an application to amend the plaint. However, having

obtained a final date to tender an Amended Plaint, the Plaintiff failed to do so.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff by Petition dated 04/05/2010, made an application in terms of

Section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code to add parties named as 1st to 8th Respondents to

the Plaint. Accordingly, the learned District Judge by order dated 24/09/2012, permitted

the Plaintiff to add the 3rd and 5th Respondents to the said application, who are now sought

to be added as 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Thereafter, the case was called on 20/01/2015, and

was fixed for trial on 30/04/2015, against the 1st Defendant and ex-parte trial against the

2nd and 3rd Defendants.

5

On the date first fixed for trial, ie. 30/04/2015, on an application made by the Plaintiff, the

case was taken out of the trial roll and listed to be called to accommodate parties to take

steps.

On 21/02/2018, the Plaintiff filed an amended Plaint consisting amendments to the

original Plaint dated 05/11/2008. The Defendant objected to the Amended Plaint and

accordingly, the matter was fixed for inquiry.

After considering the written submissions tendered by both parties, the learned District

Judge by his order dated 05/10/2018, permitted certain amendments proposed by the

Plaintiffs amended plaint dated 21/02/2018. (The order dated 05/10/2018 is at p.386

marked X8)

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned District Judge permitting the Plaintiff to

amend the Plaint, the Defendant appealed to the Provincial High Court of Negombo.

When the case came up for support on 21/11/2018, the Plaintiff was absent and

unrepresented. The Court, having observed that the notices were dispatched, permitted the

Counsel for the Defendant to support the application ex-parte. Having heard the

Defendant, the Court by Order dated 21/11/2018, refused the said application. Being

aggrieved by the said Order of the Provincial High Court, the Defendant-Petitioner-

Appellant is before this Court to set aside the original order dated 05/10/2018 and the

order given by the Court sitting in appeal dated 21/11/2018.

This Court by its order dated 13/02/2020, granted leave to appeal on questions of law set

out in paragraph 19 (v), (vi), (vii), (xi) and (xv) of the Petition of Appeal dated 17/12/2018

which are set out below.

I. The learned District Court Judge and the learned High Court Judges have failed

to consider that this case has been first fixed for trial on 30.04.2015 and therefore

Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code should apply in this case, and

accordingly the requirements of Section 93(2) had to be satisfied before the

amendment of plaint could be allowed;

6

II. The learned District Judge and the learned High Court Judges failed to consider

that the Plaintiff was guilty of laches within the meaning of Section 93(2) and

therefore the amendment of the plaint should have been refused;

III. The learned High Court judges failed to consider the time (nearly 10 years) taken

by the Plaintiff to amend the plaint;

IV. The learned High Court Judges erred by failing to consider that the provisions of

Section 21 of the Civil procedure Code cannot be read in isolation and that the

same has to be read along with the provisions of Sections 93(1) and 93(2) which

deal with amendment of pleadings including amendment of the plaint, as has been

held in Colombo Shipping Co., Ltd. V. Chirayu Clothing (Pvt) Ltd, (1995) 2 SLR

97.

In the written submissions filed of record, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff refers to

the following consequential issue of law which is purported to have been raised on the

said date, ie,

Whether the first date of trial can be considered as 30/04/2015, when the learned

District Judge has taken this case out of the trial roll for further steps without any

objections by the Petitioner.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties were in agreement that the main

issue of contention between the parties was,

whether the provisions of Section 93(1) or 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code would

apply to the said application for amendment of Plaint.

The Defendant submits that the learned Judge sitting in appeal erred by failing to consider

that the provisions of Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be read in isolation

but has to be read along with the provisions of Section 93(1) and 93(2) of the said Code.

It is to be noted that prior to the impugned order which permitted the amendment of Plaint,

the Plaintiff sought permission of Court to amend the plaint but failed to take necessary

steps to that effect.

7

The position of the Defendant is that in the circumstances of this case, both the learned

Trial Judge and the learned High Court Judge erred by applying Section 93(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code. The Defendant contends that both courts have failed to appreciate the

grounds to be considered as provided, before a Court makes an order in terms of Section

93(2). The Defendant argues that the original Plaint was filed in 2008 and the application

for an Amended Plaint made almost 10 years later with no reasons given, has not been

considered by Court and questions the Plaintiffs failure to give reasons to satisfy Court

to permit the amendment, which in effect was not considered by Court. The Defendant

also submits that both the Trial Judge and the learned Judge sitting in appeal failed to

consider that the Plaintiff was guilty of laches within the meaning of Section 93(2) of the

Code of Civil Procedure.

The Plaintiffs position is that in terms of Section 93(1), the date first fixed for trial is not

necessarily the first date on which the case is first fixed for trial but would include any

date to which the trial is postponed and therefore, the Trial Judge is given a wide discretion

to allow amendments made prior to the first date of trial.

To strengthen this position, the Plaintiff relies on the Judgment delivered by the Court of

Appeal in the case of Karunaratne vs. Alwis (2007) 1 SLR 214 and a similar view taken

in the case of Sri Lanka Savings Bank vs. Global Tea Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and others

SC/Appeal/ 171/2015, decided on 12/06/2019.

Accordingly, it is submitted that 30/04/2015 was not the date the case was first fixed for

trial within the meaning of Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Plaintiff further

states that since the case was fixed for pre-trial steps on 27/02/2018, the said date should

be considered as the date first fixed for trial and not 30/04/2015.

It is also contended that since Section 93(1) of the Civil Procedure Code applies to the

amendment of pleadings sought by the Plaintiff, it is not necessary to satisfy the

requirements in Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code as wide discretion is given to

the learned District Judge to permit amendments which come under Section 93(1). It is

8

further contended that the question of laches would not come into consideration since the

laps of time was due to numerous steps taken and applications made by both parties. It is

also noted by the Plaintiff that the Defendant did not object to the case been taken off the

trial roll on 30/04/2015.

Section 93(1) and (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, as amended, reads thus: -

93 (1). Upon application made to it before the day first fixed for trial of the action,

in the presence of, or after reasonable notice to all the parties to the action, the Court

shall have full power of amending in its discretion, all pleadings in the action, by way

of addition, or alteration, or of omission.

93 (2). On or after the day first fixed for trial of the action and before the final

judgment, no application for the amendments of any pleadings shall be allowed unless

the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the Court that grave and

irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on no

other ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

As observed before, this case was first fixed for trial on 30/04/2015 and thereafter, the

case was mentioned for steps in order to facilitate a commission to issue at the instance of

the Plaintiff. After several dates of court sittings, the learned Trial Judge fixed the case for

pre-trial hearing on 27/02/2018.

However, on 21/02/2018, the Plaintiff moved to amend the plaint at which point the

Defendant objected. The amended Plaint dated 21/02/2018, seeks to add the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants who were permitted to be added by order dated 24/09/2012, which is over five

years from the date of the said order. It also seeks to amend paragraph 7 and 8 of the Plaint

to include the 3rd and the 4th schedule, to describe the lands, over which the Plaintiff claims

a servitude right to dispose water from his land to Muthurajawala.

It is noted that in paragraph 8 of the original plaint the Plaintiff describes that the flow of

water from the land described in the 1st schedule over the land described in the 2nd schedule

of the plaint to have prevailed for the past forty years.

9

Section 93 of the Civil Procedure Code was amended by Act No. 9 of 1991, and the

rationale underlying the amendment introduced by the said Act was recognized by G. P.

S. De Silva C.J. in the case of Kuruppuarachchi vs. Andreas (1996) 2 SLR 11, in the

following manner;

The amendment introduced by Act No. 9 of 1991 was clearly intended to prevent the

undue postponement of trials by placing a significant restriction on the power of the

court to permit amendment of pleadings on or after the day first fixed for the trial of

the action. An amendment of pleadings on the date of trial, more often than not, results

in the postponement of the trial. In this connection it would not be inappropriate to

refer to the observations of Sansoni, J. (as he then was) in Daryanani vs. Eastern Silk

Emporium Ltd., I have also always understood the rule to be that an amendment

should be applied for as early as possible and as soon as it becomes apparent that it

would be necessary.

It was further observed that;

While the Court earlier discouraged amendment of pleadings on the date of trial.

Now the court is precluded from allowing such amendments save on the ground

postulated in the subsection.

In this background it would be pertinent to discuss as to what constitutes the first date

fixed for trial within the meaning of Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The 1st question of law is structured on the basis that, 30/04/2015 can be considered as the

first date fixed for trial and therefore Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code should

apply.

In Ceylon Insurance Co. Ltd vs. Nanayakkara and Another (1999) 3 SLR 50,

Weerasuriya J., inter alia, dealt with what constitutes the first date fixed of trial, when he

observed;

that section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for fixing the date of trial and

such date constitutes, the day first fixed for trial. Section 48 of the Judicature Act

10

provides for continuation of a trial before the Judge who succeeds the Judge before

whom trial commenced. The discretion vested in that succeeding Judge either to

continue with the trial or to commence proceedings afresh does not affect the nature

of the order made in terms of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code relating to the

fixing of the first trial date. Thus, the order made fixing the date of trial in terms of

section 80, becomes the "day first fixed for trial" within the meaning of section 93 (2)

of the Civil Procedure Code.

The same rational was echoed in the case of Maseena vs. Sahud and Another (2003) 3

SLR 109 where it was held that,

Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for fixing the date of trial and such

date constitutes the day first fixed for trial.

The Plaintiff contended that the day first fixed for trial is not necessarily the first date on

which the case is first fixed for trail but would include any date to which the trial is

postponed and when an application for amendment of pleadings is made, the Judge is

granted a discretion to permit amendments made prior to the first date of trial under

Section 93(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The plaintiff relied on Karunaratne vs. Alwis (2007) 1 SLR 214, where Eric Basnayake

J. took a wide approach following the ratio-decidendi in Siripura Hewavasam Pushpa vs.

Leelawathie Bandaranayake and three others (2004) 3 Sri LR 162), where S.N. Silva

C.J. referring to the day first fixed for trial said thus:

"it is clear that the date of trial is not necessarily the first date on which the case is

fixed for trial, but would also include any date to which the trial is postponed".

Thus, Eric Basnayake J. held:

Therefore, the day first fixed for trial could mean the day the trial actually began.

Any amendment made prior to the date the trial was begun therefore comes under

section 93 (1) empowering the Judge granting wide discretion in allowing

amendments.

11

However, in Kanagaraj vs. Alankara (2010) 1 SLR 185, Eric Basnayake J. commenting

on the initial date that was fixed for the trial, stated that:

the fact that the trial did not commence has no bearing. What is important is the date,

first fixed for trial.

The Plaintiff also relied in the unreported case of Sri Lanka Savings Bank Ltd Vs. Global

Tea Lanka (Pvt) Ltd & Others, SC/App./171/2015, where the Supreme Court discussed

the "date of trial first fixed" or "first date of trial" and "the date fixed for the trial of an

action" in the context where the Court had struck out the date from the trial roll scheduled

for the date appointed for the trial, as such, the facts of the said case can be clearly

distinguished from the instant application.

Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code stipulates an appointed date for the trial of the

action. Journal entry dated 20/01/2015, makes it abundantly clear that the appointed date

for the trial of the action was 30/04/2015. In an action, the appointed date for the trial of

the action and/or the first date fixed for trial can be one and the same.

As observed in Ceylon Insurance Co. Ltd vs. Nanayakkara and Another (1999) 3 SLR

50 (supra):

the order made fixing the date of trial in terms of section 80, becomes the "day first

fixed for trial" within the meaning of section 93 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In this case, the amendments sought to be made are moved after the day first fixed for trial

and therefore, for the reasons set out above, it is imperative that Section 93(2) should

apply.

Application of Section 93(2) was discussed by Ranaraja J. in Gunasekera and another

Vs. Abdul Latiff (1995) 1 SLR 225 at 232, where he stated thus: -

"The amendments to pleadings on or after the first date of trial can now be allowed

only in very limited circumstances. It prohibits court from allowing an application for

amendment at this stage unless (1) it is satisfied that grave and irremediable injustice

12

will be caused if the amendment is not permitted, and (2) the party applying has not

been guilty of laches. On no other ground can court allow an application for an

amendment of pleadings. Furthermore, court is obliged to record reasons for

concluding that the two conditions referred to have been satisfied."

In the impugned judgment, the learned Trial Judge noted the laxity on the part of the

Plaintiff to follow the appropriate procedure to add the 2nd and the 3rd Defendants in

keeping with the order dated 24/09/2012.

The Court further observed that in view of the orders made on 24/09/2012 and 17/01/2013,

the Plaintiff failed to amend the Plaint to disclose a cause of action and also the relief

sought against the Defendants to be added. The learned Trail Judge permitted the Plaint

to be amended on the basis that the amendments would not change the scope of the action

or cause any prejudice to the Defendant already made known. The Court, having noted

that this action was instituted in 2008, observed that the Plaintiff did not act promptly

according to procedure prescribed by law to tender the proposed amendments. However,

subject to costs the Plaintiff was permitted to amend the Plaint.

The lower Court in its order emphasized the fact that, subsequent to an addition of a party,

it is mandatory that the Plaint is amended in terms of Section 21 of the Civil Procedure

Code. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendant argued that Section 21 cannot

be considered in isolation and cited the case Colombo Shipping Co vs. Chirayu Clothing

(1995) 2 SLR 97, where Ranaraja J. dealing with the said issue extensively, held that,

Since the amendment by Act, No. 9 of 1991, if an application is made to add a party

as a defendant after the first date of trial, Sections 18, 21 and 93(2) of the Code have

to be read together, in allowing or refusing such an application.

The learned Judges sitting in appeal too, observed that an application was not filed to add

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, even though the Court permitted the said parties to be added

by order dated, 24/09/2012. The Court also observed the long delay on the part of the

13

Plaintiff to amend the Plaint, however, the Court did not make any finding on the party

applying, of being guilty of lashes.

Even though the trial court and the Court sitting in appeal recognized the delay on the

party applying for an amended plaint, failed to make a finding that a legal right or claim

will not be enforced or allowed if a long delay in asserting the right or claim has prejudiced

the adverse party.

The doctrine of laches is based on the maxim that "equity aids the vigilant and not those

who slumber on their rights." (Black's Law Dictionary). The outcome is that a legal right

or claim will not be enforced or allowed if a long delay in asserting the right or claim has

prejudiced the adverse party.

In Paramalingam vs. Sirisena and Another (2001) 2 SLR 239, Wigneswaran J. drew a

distinction between "before the day first fixed for trial and on or after the day first fixed

for the trial. Where it was held that:

The Courts discretion was unfettered with regard to amendments before the first

date of trial subject to an application having to be made to do it with notice to all other

parties. But its powers on or after the first date of trial were severely curtailed. The

present Section 93 has come through many vicissitudes.

and further observed that;

Laches means negligence or unreasonable delay in asserting or enforcing a right.

There are two equitable principles which come into play when a statute refers to a

party being guilty of laches. The first doctrine is that delay defeats equities. The second

is that equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent. Lord Camden said Nothing can

call forth this Court into activity but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence

Similar conclusions were made in Nimalraj vs. Thamarajah and others (2005) 3 SLR

309; Rushantha Perera vs. Wijesekara (2005) 3 SLR 105; Gunasekera vs. Abdul Latiff,

(1995), 1 SLR 225; Ceylon Insurance Co. Ltd vs. Nanayakkara (1999) 3 SLR 50;

14

Colombo Shipping Co. Ltd. vs. Chirayu Clothing (Pvt) Ltd. (supra); Avudiappan vs.

Indian Overseas Bank, (1995) 2 SLR 131; Kuruppuarachchi vs. Andreas (supra);

Paramalingam vs. Sirisen and Another (supra); Ranaweera vs. Jinadasa (2001)2 SLR

239.

Therefore, it is well founded and prudent to pose the question as to whether the long delay

on the part of the Plaintiff in asserting his right or claim has prejudiced the interest of the

Defendant.

The delay of over 10 years on the part of the Plaintiff to move for an amendment of the

Plaint was observed by both courts, however, there was no order made or reasons given

by the Court to absolve the Plaintiff of such delay. The delay on the part of the Plaintiff is

not reasonably explained.

The cause of action which is alleged to have accrued against the 2nd and the 3rd Defendants

arise as a result of the right to dispose of rain water from the Plaintiffs land to

Muturajawela. In paragraph 8 of the original Plaint, the Plaintiff states that for the last 40

years the water collected in the Plaintiffs land (described in the 1st schedule) flowed

across the 1st Defendants land (described in the 2nd schedule) to Muturajawela. The

Defendant was made a party to this case on the basis that he obstructed the flow of rain

water by unlawfully filling gravel in the land described in the 2nd schedule, which was

brought to the attention of the relevant authorities. Having heard both parties the District

Court issued an injunctive order preventing the Defendant from filling soil in the said land.

In Ranaweera vs. Jinadasa (2001)2 SLR 239, Amerasinghe, J. held that:

"No postponements must be granted or absence excused, except upon emergencies

occurring after the fixing of the date, which could not have been anticipated or avoided

with reasonable diligence, and which cannot otherwise be provided for."

There is no mention in the original Plaint that the rain water collected in the Plaintiffs

land flowed over the lands described in the 3rd and 4th schedules. At the time of filing the

15

original Plaint, the Plaintiff was aware that for the last 40 years the rain water flowed to

Muturajawela across the Defendants land. The proposed amendment to the Planit is to

emphasize the fact that the rain water flowed to Muturajawela across the described lands

belonging to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Therefore, an amendment to the Plaint would not

have arisen if the Plaintiff acted with due diligence when filing the Plaint.

Apart from the procedural delay more akin to the Plaintiffs failure, as observed, an

application was made way back in 20/10/2009, where the Plaintiff moved to file an

amended Plaint, but failed to do so even on the final date granted by Court. (Journal entry

18 page 28).

Taking into consideration the delay and the circumstances peculiar to this case, an

amended Plaint, if permitted, would cause grave prejudice to the Defendant. Therefore,

the Court holds that the application to amend the Plaint should be rejected in terms of

Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Accordingly, the 1st to 4th questions of law are decided in favor of the Defendant

Appellant.

In the consequential issue of law, the Plaintiff-Respondent points out that the learned

District Judge has taken this case out of the trial roll for further steps without any objection

by the Petitioner. As held in Kuruppuarachchi vs. Andreas (supra):

The rationale underlying the amendment introduced by Act No. 9 of 1991 is when the

Court earlier discouraged amendment of pleadings on the date of trial, now the court

is precluded from allowing such amendments save on the ground postulated in the

subsection.

In terms of Section 93 (2), the onus is on the party who moves for an amendment to satisfy

Court,

that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is not

permitted, and on no other ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty

of laches.

16

Therefore, the absence of an application objecting to listing the case to be called, cannot

be held against the Defendant.

In the circumstances, the consequential issue of law raised by the Plaintiff is answered in

the negative.

Accordingly, the order of the learned District Judge of Negombo dated 05/10/2018, and

the Judgment dated 21/11/2018, delivered by the High Court of Civil Appeal Negombo is

set aside. The application to amend the Plaint is rejected. I make no order as to costs.

Appeal is allowed.
