S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The 1st Petitioner, Ms. Hondamuni Chandima Samanmalee de Zoysa Siriwardena

(Hereinafter referred to as the 1st Petitioner), and Mr. Sudusinghe Liyanage Pubudu

Kumara (Hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Petitioner), are Attorneys-at-Law of the

Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The Petitioners have made the instant application seeking

relief in respect of the infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under and

in terms of the Constitution, in the manner hereinafter more fully set out, against the

Respondents.

The 1st Respondent, Mr. Don Saman Harishchandra Malaweera (as affirmed by

his affidavit dated 15th August 2010, hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), was

an Inspector attached to the Ambalangoda Police Station at the time of the purported

incident. The 2nd Respondent, Mr. Liyana Arachchege Chandrarathna, was Sub-Inspector

attached to the Ambalangoda Police Station, while the 3rd Respondent is referred to as

Inspector Prashantha, who was Headquarters Inspector of Police Station of

Ambalangoda. The 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents respectively are Palitha Fernando,

Superintendent of Police of the Ambalangoda Division, Mahinda Balasuriya Inspector

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 32

General of Police of the Police Headquarters and the Hon. Attorney General, hereinafter

referred to as the 4th Respondent, 5th Respondent and 6th Respondent respectively.

When this application was supported by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners

this Court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution by the 1st-5th

Respondents and also for the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Constitution by the

1st and 2nd Respondents.

Subsequent to leave being granted, the Attorney General appeared for the 3rd-

6th Respondents only and refused to appear for the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The Petitioner in by the Petition dated 26th March 2010 asserts the following

incident. On 1/1/2010, a person called Bodhiyabaduge Ariyapala (hereinafter referred to

as the ‘Petitioner’s Client’) met her with his daughter Bodhiyabaduge Nishanthi

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘mother of the child’) and his grand-daughter,

Hewawasam Attanayakage Nethmi Nivarthana (the daughter of the said Bodhiyabaduge

Nishanthi (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Petitioner’s Client’s granddaughter’) intending

to file an application for maintenance against Hewawasam Attanayakage Sumith

Chinthaka Sandaruwan who is the husband of the said Bodhiyabaduge Nishanthi and

the father of her daughter Hewawasam Attanayakage Nethmi Nivarthana (hereinafter

referred to as the ‘father of the child).

The said maintenance application bearing no. 24261 was supported on

26/02/2010 and the learned Magistrate ordered the Petitioner’s client to show the child

to her mother who was at the Hospital because of a cancer and gave temporary custody

of the said child to the Petitioners client. On the same day the father of the child had

attempted to forcibly remove the said child from the custody of the Petitioner’s client,

while still at the court premises, and upon the failure to achieve this objective, had

lodged a complaint in the Police Station to the effect that the Petitioner’s client had

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 32

kidnapped the said child. Thereafter the Petitioner’s client and the child had been

summoned to the Ambalangoda Police Station, and upon the police officers handed

over the custody of the child to the Petitioner’s client after being made aware of the

order of the Magistrate for temporary custody of the said child.

Subsequently, on 28th February 2010 the Petitioner was informed by the

Petitioner’s client that the mother of the child (daughter of the Petitioners client), had

passed away on 27th February 2010 due to cancer. The 1st Petitioner was further

informed by her client, that his other daughter namely Bodhiyabaduge Shanthi and her

husband had been arrested and taken to the Ambalangoda Police Station upon a

complaint that the said persons had kidnapped the Petitioner’s client’s granddaughter

and that the Petitioner’s client was asked to come to the Police Station with his

granddaughter at 5.00 pm regarding the matter, effectively depriving them of attending

the funeral of the mother of the child being held that day.

Immediately, the 1st Petitioner informed the officers of the Human Rights

Commission (HRC) regarding the situation, and an officer there named Rupasinghe

made inquiries from the Police and informed the 1st Petitioner that the officers of the

Ambalangoda Police Station had informed him that no such arrest had been made and

to visit the said Police Station for further details. Upon this, the 1st Petitioner proceeded

to the Ambalangoda Police Station together with her client and the 2nd Petitioner and

they went to make inquiries as to the whereabouts of the said Bodhiyabaduge Shanthi

and her husband.

Upon reaching the Ambalangoda Police Station at around 5.00 pm, the 1st

Petitioner confronted a crowd of persons who had gathered with the father of the child

at the Police Station and the said Bodhiyabaduge Shanthi and her husband were seated

on a bench at the Police Station. When the 1st Petitioner inquired as to the reason for

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 32

the arrest of the two said persons, the 1st Petitioner was notified that there was no arrest

as such, nor a record of arrest at the Police Station.

Importantly, the Petitioners admit that they were informed that the 3rd

Respondent was away pertaining to a meeting during this day.

Upon the Petitioner reaching the entrance of the Police Station the father of the

child approached them and started to verbally abuse the 1st Petitioner saying,

“ඔයග ොලගලො ආගේ සලිවලටද? සලි ඕගෙද? අපි සලි ගදන්ෙම්. අම්මො

ගෙගෙක් ගන්ද? ලැජ්ජ ෙැද්ද ගම් වගේ වැඩ වලට එන්ෙ?”

(“Did you come for the money? Do you need money? We will give you

money. Aren’t you a mother? Aren’t you ashamed to come for work of this

kind?”)

Thereafter, the 1st Respondent together with the 2nd Respondent took the

Petitioner’s client inside the Minor offences branch of the Police Station. The 1st

Respondent menacingly said,

“ආ උඹ ආවද? මම අද ග ොඳට සලෙන්ෙම්. වගෙන් යන්ෙ.”

(“ah, you came here? Today, I will treat you well. Come with me.”)

The Petitioners state that even after having been informed that the Petitioners

were Attorneys-at-Law, the 1st and 2nd Respondents continued yelling and threatening

them. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent pointed at the 1st Petitioner in a derogatory

manner and shouted because she had a mobile phone in her hand, saying,

“ඕෆ් ෙෙෙවො ඔය ගෆෝන් එෙ. ඕෆ් ෙෙෙවො. ගමතෙ ගෆෝන් තියො න්ෙ බැ ැ.

ගේගෙන්ගන් ෙැද්ද?

(“Switch off the phone. Switch it off. You cannot keep phones here. Don’t you

understand”.)

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 32

The Petitioner also alleges that no objections were raised to the mobile phones

carried by the crowd accompanying the father of the child. The 1st Petitioner at this

point, started recording the verbal abuse by the 1st and 2nd Respondents using her

mobile phone. When the 1st Respondent repeatedly interrogated the 1st Petitioner’s

client as to his right to the custody of his granddaughter, the Petitioners intervened and

stated that such custody was given temporarily by the Magistrate’s Court to the

grandfather and that the father of the child who was present at the police station was

aware of such events. Petitioner stated that even at that point, the 1st Respondent

shouted at the 1st Petitioner in derogation by stating that,

“මට ඒ වාර්තාව දෙන්න. මට මද ේස්ත්ේරාත්තුමියදෙන් එද ම වාර්තාවක් එවලා නෑ.

නඩුදව ඒවා මද ේස්ත්ේරාත්තට කියන එකයි ඇත්තදත්ත”.

(“Give me that report. I have not received such a report from the Magistrate.

Tell that to the magistrate at court, not to me.”)

Despite all the efforts of the Petitioners, the Petitioners state that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents were determined to frame charges on the basis that the 1st Petitioner’s

client had kidnapped the grandchild and the 1st Respondent even went so far as to

further shout at the Petitioner,

“ළමයා පැ ැර දෙන යාමට වැරදි උපදෙස්ත්ේ දීම ෙැන ඔයදොල්ලන්ට විරුද්ධවත්ත මම

පියවර ෙන්නවා. මමත්ත උස්ත්ාවියට එනවා. එතදකාට බලාෙන්න පුලුවන් ඔයදොල්දලෝ

දේ නඩුවට දේන්දන් දකාද ාමෙ කියලා.”

(“I will also take action against you for giving wrong instructions for child

abduction. I'm coming to court too. Then we can see how you face this

case.”)

and continued to shout saying,

“ෙරුවා දනාදුන්දනාත්ත ෙැන්ම තමුන්ලව අත්තඅඩංගුවට අරදෙන ද ට උදද් උස්ත්ාවි

ොනවා.”

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 32

(“If you don’t hand over the child, you will also be arrested immediately and

produced before the court tomorrow morning.”)

The Petitioners state that the 2nd Respondent then humiliated and intimidated

the Petitioners by saying that,

“කතා කරකර ඉන්දන් දමාකටෙ දේ දෙන්නටත්ත පැමිනිල්ලක් ස්ත්ට න්කරලා නඩු ොන

එකයි ඇත්තදත්ත.”

(“Why just stay here talking, we might as well lodge a complaint against

these two and sue them as well”)

The 1st Respondents then turned towards the party accompanying the father of

the child and stated that,

“ස්ත්ාක්ි දෙන්න ඕනෑ දේ කට්ටිය ළමයා පැ ැරෙත්ත බවට ඔය දොල්දලෝ… මම දේ

අයට විරුද්ධව පියවර ෙන්නවා.

(“you all need to give evidence saying that they kidnapped the child... I will

take action against them”.)

At the same time the 2nd Respondent asked and wrote down the Petitioner’s

names and addresses.

Thereafter the 1st Petitioner’s client’s daughter Bodhiyabaduge Shanthi stated

that,

“අපි ළමයා දෙන්නේ ස්ත්ර්. අපිට කරෙර දවන්න බැ ැ. මට ළමයි දෙන්දනක් ඉන්නවා.

මට දෙෙර යන්න ඕනෑ.”

(“We will give you the child, sir. We can't face such trouble. I have two

children. I want to go home.”)

Following which she brought the child to the police station. The 1st Petitioner

inquired from her client if he was consenting to handing over the child and upon hearing

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 32

this, the 1st Respondent continued to attempt to intimidate the 1st Petitioner by claiming

that the child needs to be produced or that he will take legal action against them and

shouted at the 1st Petitioner.

Furthermore, when the 1st Petitioner tried to explain the fact that the father of the child

had failed to maintain the child, the 1st Respondent rudely interrupted the 1st Petitioner

and continued yelling,

“මට උෙන්වන්න එන්න එපා නඩත්තු නඩු පවරන ැි..”

(“Don’t try to teach me about maintenance suits”).

When the Petitioners sought to explain the circumstances as Attorneys-at- Law,

the 1st Respondent simply yelled at them, shouted at the 1st Petitioner saying,

“දේ මිනි ා දේ ළමයාව දූෂණය කදලාත්ත, කරෙර කදලාත්ත ඔයදොල්දලා දමාකෙ

කරන්දන්? ළමයාදේ වෙකීම බාරෙන්නවෙ?”

(“What will you do if this man rapes or abuses this child? Do you take

responsibility for the child?”)

The Petitioners states that, then in the most degrading manner, the 2nd

Respondent told the 1st Petitioner in total sarcasm:

“ම දලාකුවට දේ දනෝනා ළමදයක්දේ නඩුවකට දපනුනා. අේමා නර්ස්ත්ේ, තාත්තතා

දේලර් ොඩ්, තමුන්දෙ දුව දූෂණය කරලා අෙ. දමාකෙ අෙ ඇවිත්ත ඒ වදේ තව නඩුවක්

ඇති කරන්න කතා කරනවා. නීතිඥදයෝ අස්ත්ාධාරණ දලස්ත් මුෙල් ේබ කරෙන්නවා.”

(“Today there was a rape case where the mother was a nurse, and the father

of a child was a jailer guard who had raped his child. Are you here to create

another such case? Lawyers earn money in such unfair ways”)

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 32

at which point the Police officers and the members of the public who were present there

laughed, causing the Petitioners severe embarrassment and humiliation and to the legal

profession at large.

Additionally, The Petitioners submit that it was evident that the 1st and 2nd

Respondent were under the influence of alcohol during this encounter due to the strong

smell emanating from them and the manner in which they were behaving. However, the

1st Respondent in his affidavit dated 19th August 2010 denies being under the influence

of alcohol and submits that he discharged his duties in good faith according to law and

consciously believed to be doing the right thing to administer justice. He alleges that

the Petitioner strives to construe their words out of context in a different manner to

strengthen their feeble case. He further states in objection that he had only assisted the

father of the child of that case, to obtain access to the child for him to take the child

with him to attend the funeral of the mother of the child together and denies any

knowledge of alleged violations. He states that they were polite in requesting the 2nd

Petitioner to switch off the mobile phone.

The 2nd Respondent in his affidavit dated 16th June 2010, states his objection by

largely adopting a position in line with the stance of the 1st Respondent as above, and

he further states that as he suffers from epilepsy, he refrains from taking alcohol and

thus denies the allegation that he was intoxicated during the confrontation.

Both the 1st and 2nd Respondent in their affidavits alleges that the reasoning

behind the incident on 28th February 2010 whereby the Petitioner’s client and his

granddaughter were summoned to the Police Station and the alarming phone call by

them stating that the Petitioner’s client’s other daughter as well as her husband were

under arrest for kidnapping his grandchild was based on a complaint lodged at the

police station by a person bearing the name of the father of the child, but however, the

facts of the complaint attached as ‘R1’, is in contradiction to the narration of accounts

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 32

by the Petitioner. In this complaint the father of the child is stated to be a disabled ex-

soldier. He admits to that he and his wife were living separately, but states that this is

purely owing to the conduct of her parents in having kept her with them on most

occasions. He states that upon his request at the magistrate, which was based upon the

request of the mother of the child, the Magistrate ordered for him to take the child

accompanied by the Petitioner’s client (grandfather), to visit her mother at the hospital.

He further purports that the Petitioner’s client thereafter refused to do so and

had forcefully taken the child with him. Additionally, he states that he files this complaint

in order for his child to be able to be at her mother’s funeral, which he states is not

possible as the grandfather and the mother’s family are withholding the child in a very

unreasonable manner. This rendition of accounts does not align with the facts put

forward by the Petitioners or the affidavit provided by the Petitioner’s client.

However, I must note that this extract is dated 28th February 2010, but the time

recorded is 6:50 PM of the same date. In the Petition, it is stated that the Petitioner and

the Petitioner’s client were called to the Police station at 5 PM and they were present at

this time. Even if minor room for error is allowed in timing, it is evident that this

complaint has been recorded following the initial call ordering the Petitioner’s client and

the child to be present at the Police Station. In light of the above, it aligns with the

statements of the Petitioner in that there were no valid complaints filed on this date

authorizing for any such procedure to commence at the time the Petitioner’s Client was

ordered to present himself and his grandchild to the Police Station.

Further, at no point in ‘R1’, does this complainant provide any testament

specifically against his sister-in law or brother-in-law who were the persons taken to the

Police Station initially based on this purported crime of kidnapping. Their names,

connection to this incident, nor their existence is acknowledged in this complaint as it is

only the Petitioner’s Client as well as the phrase “family of his wife” who are mentioned

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 32

by the complainant. For the above reasons, I must note that the procedure intended to

be followed has simply been disregarded in the conduct of the Police in attempting to

solve this incident. Thus, despite the 1st and 2nd Respondent stating that they merely

acted in good faith in order to administer justice, they have not done so according to

law as this disregard for procedure is a dangerous manner in which to exercise the

powers bestowed upon them as police officers, who are guardians of society.

In addition to the above, the 1st Petitioner submits in her Written Submission that

she was subject to further incidents of harassment and intimidation following the

granting of leave to proceed by this court. There had been an incident where an

unknown group of persons had arrived late at her house in a jeep on the 19th of March

2010. She states that they kicked on their front door at which point the family had

switched off all lights and called the Police Emergency number. She states that after

about 15 minutes the group of persons left in the same vehicle. The next day her and

her brother had been asked to write down their statements in regards to this event by

the Ambalangoda Police. Further on the 1st of June, there had been a vehicle similar to

the one in the previous incident passing by their house several times and parked near

her house. A person had gotten out of the vehicle saying “is this the place?”. Her

neighbor in her statements affirm that the vehicle had a print depicting “Ambalangoda

Police”

Additionally, she states that these acts were continued particularly in the form of

allegedly having received numerous phone calls harassing her and her family. She states

that calls were received from a caller claiming to be from the Ahungalla Police Station,

further calls which the CID later traced to be from the same Police station and multiple

other calls requesting to settle the case. There have also been persons coming to her

house and causing disturbance to her and her family. Given these incidents she states

that she has taken steps to keep away from her residence in order to avoid any harm to

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 32

herself and to save her family from the harassment and trouble they have undergone

due to the instant case. She states that despite the instructions given for the Senior

Superintendent and Headquarters Inspector of the Ambalangoda Police Station to give

suitable instructions to prevent any interference to the rights of the Petitioners, the

Respondents have conducted themselves disregarding all such instructions.

Thus, the Petitioners allege that the behavior of the 1st and 2nd Respondents

during the primary incident described and the harassment afterwards caused them

severe pain of mind and humiliation. Thus, the Petitioners submits that such treatment

meted out to the Petitioners amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and

is a clear violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution.

In the instant case, following the granting of leave, it was informed to the Court

by the State Counsel that the Police Department has taken several measures and some

of them are reproduced for the purpose of completeness.

The Attorney General refused to appear on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Initially, this Court took cognizance of the impending disciplinary inquiry against the 1st

and 2nd Respondents initiated by the Inspector General of Police and directed him to

conclude the said disciplinary inquiry within one month and report the findings of the

inquiry through the Attorney General. The disciplinary inquiry held against the 1st and

2nd Respondents and the Petitioner had successfully led evidence to establish the

allegations levelled against the 1st and 2nd Respondents, especially the use of abusive

language and they were found guilty, thereafter, disciplinary orders were made and

punishments were imposed.

The Counsel for the 3rd-5th Respondents further drew the attention of Court to

that the fact that on the date in question, the 3rd Respondent was not at the

Ambalangoda Police Station where the incident took place (as admitted by the

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 32

Petitioners’ themselves). The 3rd Respondent was away on official duty at the time and

was therefore not privy to the incident pertaining to the Petitioners. Further, it was

submitted that while the Respondents were cognizant that the 3rd-5th Respondents are

superior officers of the 1st and 2nd Respondent, the 3rd-5th Respondents stated that they

have taken all steps required and necessary in law to take disciplinary action against the

alleged conduct of the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The 4th Respondent was directed by the Deputy Inspector General (Southern

Province), to record a complaint of the 1st Petitioner in relation to an alleged incident

that had taken place at the Ambalangoda Police Station involving the alleged conduct

of the 1st and 2nd Respondents who were attached to the Ambalangoda Police Station

at the time. Accordingly, this Court observed that, 4th Respondent acted in accordance

with the direction and recorded the statements of the Petitioners. Thereafter, on

16.03.2010, through the assistance of the 3rd Respondent, the 4th Respondent took steps

to record the statements of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The 4th Respondent also

obtained a statement from WPC 7622 Sujeewani who was on duty at the minor offences

branch at the Ambalangoda Police Station on the day of the alleged incident.

Pursuant to the complaint of the Petitioners to the Inspector General of Police,

the then 5th Respondent had directed that 4th Respondent to conduct an inquiry

pertaining to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Thereafter, the 4th Respondent had warned

the officers and personally called the Petitioners and apologized for the incident that

had occurred at the Ambalangoda Police Station. The findings of the inquiry were

communicated to the Police Headquarters by a letter dated 22/04/2010 marked as ‘4R9’.

Further by the letter annexed as ‘4R10’ the 4th Respondent has communicated the

charge sheet, in which he clarifies that as per the findings of his investigation it is

established that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have shouted at the two Attorneys-at-law,

and thus has disrespected their integrity and disregarded their dignity as persons and

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 32

professionals. Based on the above he further states that the officers are convicted of the

violation of Schedule 2 of the Establishments Code, for disreputable behavior,

disobedience and intimidation.

The 4th Respondent had recommended that the 1st and 2nd Respondents be

charged at a departmental level in respect of the findings of the inquiry and the same

was communicated to the Petitioners by letter dated 20/04/2010. Upon the actions

taken by the 4th Respondent, the 1st and 2nd Respondents were interdicted from service.

The final determination (disciplinary order) of the disciplinary inquiry against the 1st and

2nd Respondents was submitted to this Court by way of motion dated 08/03/2016.

Accordingly, the inquiry report pertaining to the 1st Respondent stated that he had been

dispossessed of two salary increments, ordered to follow a capacity building program

and had also been ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 30,000/- (in 24 instalments). The inquiry

report pertaining to the 2nd Respondent indicates that he was found guilty of an offence

under the second schedule of offences committed by public officers’ in the

Establishment Code, and accordingly, he was reprimanded and a stoppage of all salaries

and allowances was ordered.

Alleged violations and steps taken by the Respondents

Having referred to the factual matrix of this application as given by the parties,

let me now consider the said facts pertaining to the incident in order to ascertain

whether the Petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11,12(1) and

14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated by the Respondents.

The Petitioners apply to this court under Article 11 of the Constitution for an

alleged violation of the Petitioners’ fundamental rights, the provision which reads as

follows:

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 32

“No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment”.

Article 12(1) states that,

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of

the law..”

Article 14(1) (g) states that,

“(1) Every citizen is entitled to-

(g) the freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any lawful

occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise.”

In regards to the violation of the constitutional rights of the Petitioners

particularly by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, we may refer to the case of Mrs. W. M. K

De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation (1989) 2 Sri LR 393 at 405 in

which Amerasinghe, J stated that

“In my view Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits any act by which severe

pain or suffering, whether physical or mental is, without lawful sanction in

accordance with a procedure established by law, intentionally inflicted on a

person by a public official acting in the discharge of his executive or

administrative duties or under the colour of office”

In the instant case, the trauma caused is a form of mental suffering inflicted intentionally

by public officials in the discharge of his duties. Thus, it is imperative that such action

should be condemned by this Court.

It is my view that the treatment meted out to the Petitioners by the 1st and 2nd

Respondent is a violation of their rights under Article 11 of the constitution. Further it

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 32

is a violation of the Petitioners rights under Article 12 and 14 (1) (g) of the constitution

as it is an interference with their freedom to engage in their occupation, particularly

given that this incident was an occurrence during their exercise of duties as are demands

of their occupation, in the best interest of the 1st Petitioner’s Client.

Additionally, the Counsel for the Petitioners in his submissions, relied on the

ground that the Respondents’ conduct was in violation of ‘Police Rules 2012’. These

rules were published in the gazette notification bearing no. 1758/36 dated 18-05-2012

and were produced before this Court together with the written submissions of the

Petitioners. It is observed that these rules issued by the Inspector General of police under

Section 55 of the Police Ordinance is cited as ‘Appearance of Attorney-at-Law at police

stations’ and lays down certain guidelines to be followed. Clause two of the rules is

reproduced below:

“2. These rules shall be applicable to every police station established under the

Police Ordinance (Chapter 53) and shall be followed by all police officers of

whatever rank, serving in such stations within Sri Lanka. “

Clause three clarifies how any Attorney at law must be treated by the Police stating

that every Attorney at-Law shall be treated cordially and courteously and given a fair

and patient hearing as follows:

3. (1) Every Attorney-at-Law, who enters the precincts of a police station established

under the Police Ordinance situated in any part of Sri Lanka, in his capacity of an

Attorney-at-Law for the purpose of representing and watching the interests of a

person who is the client of such Attorney-at-Law, shall be treated cordially and

courteously and given a fair and patient hearing by the police officers attached to

such Police Station, whatever their rank.

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 32

(2) Every police officer attached to a Police Station shall not at any time during

which he is dealing with an Attorney-at-Law present in such police station for the

purpose of representing and watching the interests of a person who is his client,

use physical force on the person of such Attorney-at-Law or resort to the use of

abusive language or any other form of intimidatory conduct.

Clause four goes on to state that no police officer shall use physical force on an

Attorney at-Law or resort to the use of abusive language or any other form of

intimidatory conduct. Clause ten refers to the manner in which an officer of the police

force who violates the rules should be dealt with viz. punishable under the provisions of

Section 55 of the Police Ordinance and be subjected to a disciplinary inquiry conducted

by the Department of Police.

However, the ‘Police Rules 2012’ were promulgated after the alleged incident.

While these rules are valuable in relation to the expression of the conduct expected of

police officers, I do not wish to place any reliance on the said rules in order to determine

whether the Respondents breached the said rules or whether the Petitioners’

fundamental rights were violated by the Respondents in view of the breach of these

rules.

The Petitioners contention in respect of the 3rd-5th Respondents was that they

should be responsible (vicariously or otherwise) for the alleged violations and further

for failing to take remedial measures or steps required by law to secure the rights of the

Petitioners.

Petitioners in their submissions relied on the view of Justice Perera’s in Faiz v

Attorney- General and others [(1995) 1 SLR 372 at page 403];

“It is true that a denial of equal protection has hitherto been largely confined

to affirmative acts of discrimination. The view that culpable, official state

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 32

inaction may also constitute a denial of equal protection has now been

recognized by the United States Supreme Court as well. In Burton v. Wilmington

Parking Authority et al (12) Justice Clark delivering the opinion of the Court,

observed thus "by its inaction the Authority and through it the state, has not

only made itself a party to the refusal of service but has elected to place its

power property and prestige behind the admitted discrimination." In Lynch v.

USA (13) the Federal Court of Appeal stated the opinion thus, "there was a time

when the denial of equal protection of the law was confined to affirmative acts,

but the law now is that culpable official inaction may also constitute a denial

of equal protection."

The counsel for the 3rd- 5th Respondents submitted that the 3rd-5th Respondents

had not by way of action or inaction violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners.

The Respondents state that they have diligently carried out their functions and duties

as required by their designations and further have taken disciplinary action against the

1st and 2nd Respondents without delay in accordance with the rules binding them. As

enumerated above, it is indeed clear that a thorough investigation regarding the

incident and further retributory action has been taken by the 3rd to 5th Respondent in

furtherance of the functions of the Respondents as superior officers of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents.

In light of all the aforementioned affirmative action taken by the 3rd-6th

Respondents, I am of the view that satisfactory disciplinary action was taken against the

1st and 2nd Respondent as a response to their behavior, as was directed by this court

and based on the complaint lodged by the Petitioners to the Inspector General of Police.

In addressing the conduct of the 1st and 2nd Petitioner, I believe that the views

expressed by Justice Shirani A. Bandaranayake in the case of Adhikary and Another v.

Amarasinghe and Others (2003) 1 SLR 270 is of important. It was expressed that

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 32

“When police officers, who are guardians of the law and whose duties

include 'to prevent all offences, preserve peace and to apprehend disorderly

characters', behave in an outrageous manner without paying heed to safe

guarding and protecting the rights of the people, a dismal picture of such

officers held in such high esteem emerges.”

It is indeed for the sake of upholding the integrity of the entire body of police

officers that we must condone incidents of misconduct such that the reputation of the

police forces may not be tarnished by the misdemeanors of a few. It would be great

injustice if the actions of a few were to discredit the valuable services of the dedicated

and disciplined officials dutifully ensuring the safety and peace of all citizens.

In the context of the services of police officers, we have seen that the police

officers do not always work in optimal conditions to protect the people. That includes

investigations, trial proceedings and even includes regularizing the motor traffic.

Majority of the officers are acting in the pursuit of the betterment of the people and the

country. Violation of rules, laws and standards have been noticed since a considerable

period of time by the authorities and are informed to the Police Department and the

Government. Unfortunately, in certain incidents there are no prompt and adequate

measures taken to control or minimize the violations of errant officers.

However, in the instant case, the State and the Police Department should have

taken necessary prevention measures to prevent this incident from happening. This

Court has observed that in many cases that some of the violations are recurring, which

directs towards a conclusion that the relevant authorities in the Police Department are

not taking adequate preventive measures. In order to prevent such incidents from

recurring and to protect the necessary parties, it is insufficient to take action in isolated

events against the specified officers. There must be awareness raised through all ranks

of officers throughout the country, this is given that blaming officers following violations

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 32

is not a deterrent to unfavorable practices and it does not build a sustainable method

of maintaining proper conduct among officers.

Additionally, officers must be clearly aware of the laws governing them and the

standard of conduct expected of each officer, as it is unfair to hold them against

standards that they are not aware of. It is indeed a duty of the superiors in helping the

subordinate officers to execute their duties to keep them informed of these regulations

as they are published and amended. It is only through such practices that such conduct

will be continued and will encourage a sense of self discipline among officers

themselves. As in the instant case, if at least one of the officers present were aware and

informed of the appropriate conduct, they may positively act in deterring other officers

from creating such incidents, demoting the recurrence of offences.

Thus, it is imperative that Police Officers are given the necessary training through

programs aimed at capacity building. Additionally, in order to restore and retain the

faith of the public in regards to our Police Forces, the general public must be made

aware of the training the officers undertake.

In the specific context of Police officers dealing with Attorneys-at-law, it must be

noted that certain codes of conduct must be followed not only by Police Officers, but

also by Attorneys at law. In deciding upon a similar matter Justice Murdu N.B Fernando,

PC has expressed her opinion in the judgment of the case of Ratnayaka Weerakoonge

Sandya Kumari vs Lakshitha Weerasinghe, Sub Inspector of Police, Meegahatenna

and Others SC FR 75/2012 S.C Minutes dated 18.12.2019 as follows:

“Another factor that should be borne in mind is that the office of an Attorney

at-Law is also governed by the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette of

Attorney at-Law) Rules of 1988 where it is specifically stated that on

Attorney at-Law must not conduct herself in any manner which would be

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 32

reasonably regarded as unworthy, disgraceful and dishonorable by

Attorneys at Law of good repute.

When analysing the behavior of the petitioner and the 1st respondent based

on the affidavits filed before Court, I am reminded of the oft quoted saying

that, ‘courtesy begets courtesy’.”

In the above case, a key difference was the conduct of the Attorney-at-Law of the

case, who had shouted at the police officers in a degrading manner and displayed

unprofessional conduct not befitting of an Attorney-at-Law. Thus, it is expected that

Attorneys-at-Law are to respect the standards both written and unwritten, with

emphasis on good manners, etiquette and good advocacy as highlighted by A.R.B.

Amerasinghe in his book on Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers.

Indeed, the above referenced case is evidence to the fact that this court upholds such

standard by expecting it of all Attorneys-at-Law of the Supreme Court, as the integrity

of the legal profession rests in interpretations afforded to their behavior by members of

the general public in their daily execution of tasks as a member of the legal profession.

However, while the above shall remain true. It is imperative that society at large,

particularly members acting in the benefit of protection of the country respect the

judicial system of the country, of which Attorneys-at-Law play a fundamental role. As in

the instant case, when an Attorney-at-Law acts in a reasonable, non-provocative and

rational manner, unruly behavior by a police officer directed towards her is an

unacceptable response. Thus, in order for those of the legal profession to safeguard the

dignity of their office, Police officers and other members bearing public office must be

of assistance, exercising their duties by respecting codes of ethics as well as respecting

the unwritten rules of human decency.

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 32

Decision

Therefore, considering the present complaint by the Petitioners, this Court is

mindful of that incidents of this nature should be considered to be serious in nature and

it should be condemned. Taking all above matters into consideration, I find that the

State through their agents, the 1st and 2nd Respondents, have violated the Petitioners

Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12 and 14(1)(g) of the constitution as the 1st

and 2nd Respondents during the incident were acting in the colour of their office and it

is indeed the State responsible for the officers and their conduct. Thus, I find that the 1st

to 5th Respondents have violated the Petitioners Fundamental Rights as enshrined in

Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the constitution. Taking all the material before us into

consideration I find that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have also violated the Petitioners

Rights as enshrined in Article 11 of the Constitution.

I find that the 4th Respondent in charge of the division has taken meaningful

action with the assistance of the 3rd Respondent in the form of an inquiry and

subsequent retributory action. Therefore, I find that the 5th Respondent, through the 4th

and 3rd Respondent, has taken appropriate action. Hence, I order no compensation by

the state. However, I have observed as in many other Fundamental Rights cases the

State, especially the 5th Respondent must take steps to adequately train and supervise

all police personnel whether gazetted or non-gazetted to adhere to the laws practiced

in this country, to show professionalism in policing and to be trained to provide people

friendly police service to the public of this country.

In terms of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, I find that they have violated the Rights

of the Petitioners enshrined in the Constitution. As enumerated above, the 3rd to 5th

Respondents have taken appropriate action and handed down adequate punishment.

Since this court is condemning the actions of the 1st and 2nd Respondent, I order the 1st

Respondent to pay, from his personal resources, compensation of Rs. 30,000/- to each

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 32

of the 1st and 2nd Petitioners and a further sum of Rs.10, 000/- to each of the 1st and 2nd

Petitioners as litigation costs. I further direct the 2nd Respondent to pay compensation

of Rs. 30,000/- to each of the 1st and 2nd Petitioners and a further sum of Rs.10, 000/- to

each of the 1st and 2nd Petitioners as litigation costs. All of which must be paid from his

personal resources.

Application allowed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

L.T.B. DEHIDENIYA, J.

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

B.P. ALUWIHARE, PC, J.,

I had the benefit of reading the judgment in draft of my brother, Justice Thurairaja

PC, however I wish to express my own opinion in this matter.

This court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of fundamental rights

guaranteed under; -

[A] Articles 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution against the 1st to the 5th Respondents

and

[B] Article 11 of the Constitution against the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 32

The facts, albeit briefly, are as follows;

Both the petitioners are Attorneys-at-Law and were engaged in their profession

at the Balapitiya Bar.

Although it might not be directly relevant to the issue before us, in order to

appreciate the incident, it would be relevant to narrate the background to the incident.

According to the 1st Petitioner Samanmalee Siriwardena, one of her clients,

Ariyapala, had sought her legal assistance to file a maintenance case on behalf of his

daughter [Nishanthi] and the grandchild [Nivarthana] against her daughter’s estranged

husband [Sandaruwan]. At the point Samanmalee Siriwardena’s services were sought,

Ariyapala’s daughter had been terminally ill due to cancer. When the maintenance

application was supported, the learned magistrate, having considered the facts and

circumstances of the case had handed over the custody of the grandchild to Ariyapala

instead of the girl’s father, Sandaruwan.

Probably infuriated by losing the custody of his daughter, Sandaruwan had made

and attempt to take custody of the child forcibly and followed it by lodging a complaint

against Ariyapala to the effect that he [Ariyapala] kidnapped the child. Consequently,

being summoned, Ariyapala had had to go the Ambalangoda police station with the

grandchild. Upon hearing this, two lawyers had rushed to the Ambalangoda Police

station to explain matters to the police and had secured the release of Ariyapala.

[Affidavits of Sampath Wimalarathne (P2a) and Nujith De Silva (P2 b) Attorneys-at-Law].

Sometime in February, Ariyapala’s daughter Nishanthi had passed away at the

Karapitiya Hospital as a result of the terminal illness she was afflicted with.

The Incident Germane to the Alleged Violations

The day after his daughter’s [Nishanthi] death, Ariyapala had contacted the 1st

Petitioner over the phone and in addition to conveying the news of Nishanthi’s death

had also told her that his other daughter, Shanthi and her husband, Aruna Shantha had

been taken into custody by the Ambalangoda police on a complaint made by

Sandaruwan to the effect that they kidnapped Nivarthana, the grandchild of Ariyapala.

The 1st Petitioner had visited the Ambalangoda police station in the company of

the 2nd Petitioner and Ariyapala and found both Shanthi and her husband seated on a

bench in the police station. They had also observed a crowd of people, including

Sandaruwan [the son-in-law of Ariyapala] gathered in front of the police station. It is

alleged that Sandaruwan had made disparaging remarks directed at the Petitioners.

According to the 1st Petitioner, when she inquired from the police as to the reasons for

the arrest of the two, she was informed that the couple was not arrested but being kept

until the arrival of the HQI, the 3rd Respondent.

At the police station, the 1st and the 2nd Respondents had forced Ariyapala into

the police station and the 1st Respondent is supposed to have addressed Ariyapala

rudely, to wit; “come, ... Today I will treat you decently”. Even after the 1st and the 2nd

Petitioners introduced themselves as lawyers, it is alleged that both the 1st and 2nd

Respondent had made a series of disparaging utterances to the Petitioners. I do not

wish to repeat them here as his Lordship Justice Thurairaja PC had reproduced the

utterances alleged to have been made by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, in his opinion.

From the discussion that ensued between the 1st and 2nd Respondent, the

Petitioners had gathered that the police were contemplating preferring a charge of

Kidnapping. Although the 1st Petitioner had informed the Respondents that the child is

in the custody of Ariyapala pursuant to a court order, the Respondents have paid scant

regard to it. Further, the 1st Respondent had threatened to file action against the

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 27 of 32

Petitioners for offering ‘wrong advice regarding the kidnapping of the child’. The 1st

Respondent had demanded that the child be produced immediately, failing which the

Petitioners would be arrested and kept in custody overnight, until they are produced in

court the following day.

In desperation, Ariyapala’s daughter Shanthi had acquiesced to surrender the

child stating that she cannot undergo further harassment. To this the 1st Respondent

had replied that if the child was not surrendered charges would be filed against them.

Attempts by the 1st Petitioner to explain the circumstances under which the custody of

the child was given to Ariyapala had been cut short rudely by the 1st Respondent with

the 2nd respondent chipping in.

At this juncture, Ariyapala had handed over the custody of the child to

Sandaruwan, his son-in-law. The Petitioners have taken up the position that

Sandaruwan’s statement was recorded only at this point.

If that was the case, then it appears that even when Ariyapala’s daughter [Shanthi]

and son-in-law [Aruna Shantha] were summoned to the police station there had been

no complaint with regard to the commission of a crime, for the police to investigate or

to act upon.

According to the Petitioners, they had rushed to the Ambalangoda police station

around 2.45 in the afternoon. The complaint of Sandaruwan had been recorded at 6.30

in the evening. Thus, the action taken by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents on this

occasion does not seem to be in accordance with the procedure established by law.

The Version of the 1st and 2nd Respondents

Both the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have filed objections in this matter.

The position of the 1st Respondent is that he took action pursuant to a complaint

made by Sandaruwan [the 1st Respondent had referred to Sandaruwan as ‘Moratuwa

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 32

Badahalage Aruna Shantha whereas his name is Hewawasam Atthanayakage Sumith

Chinthana Sandaruwan according to the documents filed by the 1st Respondent himself.]

To the effect that his daughter had been kidnapped and that he needs assistance from

the police to take his child to his wife’s funeral.

He also asserts that the Petitioners represented a suspect [presumably a

reference to Ariyapala], his daughter and son-in-law, against whom the complaint of

kidnapping was made. It must be said that this assertion is totally incorrect in that the

only allegation Sandaruwan has made in his complaint is that his father-in-law did not

allow him to take his daughter to his wife’s funeral. Nowhere has he said in his complaint

that the family members of his deceased wife were involved in preventing the daughter

from being taken to the place where the wife’s funeral was to take place, save for

Ariyapala.

I do not wish to delve into the manner in which the 1st and 2nd Respondent dealt

with the complaint made by Sandaruwan, for the reason that the issue before us is to

consider whether their actions had violated the rights of the petitioners.

There is no dispute that the Petitioners had visited the Ambalangoda police

station on that day with the objective of representing Ariyapala and getting his daughter

and son-in-law released from the custody of the police, a constitutional right

guaranteed to them under Article 14 (1) (g). There is no evidence whatsoever that the

Petitioners had entertained any animosity towards the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

All what the 1st Respondent had said was that “it is a well-known fact that my

voice is a little louder than that of a normal person” [Paragraph 30 of the 1st Respondent’s

affidavits]. The 1st respondent had gone on to state that the Petitioners attempted to

constantly interfere with their duties [Paragraph 31 of the affidavit].

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 32

The 1st Respondent, other than stating that the complaint against him is false,

had not referred to any ill feelings between the Petitioners and him. The 2nd Respondent

also had filed objections which is a general denial of the allegations made against him

by the Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent has averred that it was the Petitioners who

obstructed the performance of the duties of the 1st Respondent. Here too, the 2nd

Respondent had made no allegation that the Petitioners entertained any animosity

towards him.

In the circumstances there could not have been any reason for the Petitioners to

‘fabricates’ an allegation against the 1st and the 2nd Respondent. Considering the

material placed before this court, I hold that the version of the Petitioners is credible

and is safe to act upon.

Infringements of Fundamental Rights

Article 11 of the Constitution endows every person with absolute protection from

torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 12 (1)

stipulates that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to the equal protection

of the law. It needs no reiteration that the primary responsibility of upholding these

fundamental protections lies with the State. As reminded over and over again by this

Court, police officers, being state officers tasked with law enforcement and the

maintenance of law and order have an utmost responsibility in respecting, safeguarding

and advancing these rights. Police officers are expected to extend common courtesies

at all times when dealing with the public. The identity or the status of the person whom

the police is dealt with should have no bearing whatsoever on the fair and courteous

treatment that they are entitled to, as of right. Police officers are bound to treat every

person with dignity and respect.

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 32

In D. W. C. Mohotti v. Upul Seneviratne, OIC, Bambalapitiya and Others, SC

FR 527/08 SC minutes 27. 04. 2009 which involved an incident where an Attorney-at-

Law was obstructed by a police officer in representing his client at the police station, a

settlement was reached between the parties. The terms of the settlement were to the

effect that the IGP would issue formal rules under Section 55 of the Police Ordinance

delineating the manner in which the police should interact with persons at police

stations, police Headquarters and/or any other permanent unit, base, post or such like

that have been established by the Sri Lanka Police. By Rule No. 3 it was stated that “No

officer of the Police Force shall in any manner or circumstances whatsoever, use, physical

force, abusive language or resort to any other intermediary conduct in respect of any

person.” Regarding the treatment of Attorneys-at-Law who may enter such place for the

purpose of representing and/or watching the interests of their clients who are suspects

or otherwise, it was stated by Rule No. 1 that their right to represent their clients should

be fully recognized. Rule No. 2 required that every officer of the Police Force shall at all

times, treat such Attorney-at-Law within the above-mentioned places “cordially, and

courteously, and shall afford to such Attorney-at-Law all reasonable assistance during the

course thereof.” Any officer who acts in violation of those rules, or aids and abets the

violation of those rules is to be dealt with severely, according to the available procedures

and may be liable to any other disciplinary inquiry/proceedings and punitive sanctions.

Although the present case was anterior to the publication of the ‘Police

(Appearance of Attorneys-at-Law at Police Stations) Rules, 2012’ in Gazette

Extraordinary No. 1758/36 of 18. 05. 2012 which provided guidelines to the Police

regarding interacting with Attorneys-at-Law within the precincts of police stations, the

rules agreed upon in the Mohotti case (supra) would be applicable to the present case.

In my view the Rules referred to have only restated the Fundamental Rights enshrined

in the Constitution and referred to them expansively with the objective of enlightening

the police officers of the need to respect Fundamental Rights. The effect of the said rules

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 32

is that every person who enters a police station or similar premises should be treated

with dignity and politeness by the police. Attorneys-at-Law who represents the interests

of their clients and are in the exercise of their professional duties too are entitled to

courteous and proactive treatment. Needless to say, even in the absence of any binding

rules, these are basic human decencies any public servant owes a fellow citizen, in their

interactions. This was an occasion where a death had occurred in the family and the

grieving family members were summoned to the police while the last rites of the

deceased family member was yet to be done. In this backdrop, the conduct of the 1st

and 2nd Respondents who were officers, remunerated by the public funds, to maintain

law and order cannot be condoned and deserves only abhorrence. Police officers are

required to take extra care in the discharge of their duties in view of the fact that they

are endowed with coercive powers to perform their functions. In the instant case, they

had paid scant regard to the predicament of the bereaved family members.

As far as the Petitioners are concerned, the conduct of the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents had resulted in an infringement of Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution-

which entitles every citizen the “freedom to engage by himself or in association with

others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise.” Obstructing an

Attorney-at-Law from representing or looking into the interests of a client or

surrendering a client to the police, which are duties that a lawyer is professionally

entitled to carry out, is certainly a violation of that right.

Considering the aforesaid, I hold that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are liable for

the infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners, enshrined in Articles 12

(1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution.

There is no material before this court to hold the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents

liable for any infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners.

SC FR 242/2010 JUDGMENT Page 32 of 32

I direct the 1st and the 2nd Respondents to pay a sum of Rs. 30,000/- each of the

1st and 2nd Petitioners. In addition, I also direct the 1st and 2nd Respondents to pay a sum

of Rs.10, 000/- each as costs.

Application allowed.
