Respondents

6 Before: Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda PC Justice Janak de. Silva Justice M. A. Samayawardhena Counsel: Manohara de. Silva PC with Ms. Nadeeshani Lankatilleka for the Petitioners,

Ms. S. Barrie, SSC, for the Hon. Attorney General

Argued on: 10.02.2021

Judgment on: 09.07.2021

Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda PC

Out of the eight Petitioners before this court, the 1st to the 7th Petitioners were employed in Grade 1

of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service at the time the Public Administration Circular No. 06 of 2006 was

issued but among them the 1st and 2nd Petitioners were retired when they filed the instant application

before this court. The 8th Petitioner before this court is the Sri Lanka Accountants Service Association

a duly registered trade union.

As observed by this court, this is yet another application filed by another category of Public Service

with regard to the implementation of the Public Administration Circular 06 of 2006 issued by the

Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the circular) which

was introduced to re- structure and to have a common structure in service as well as in salary in the

Public Service. As submitted by the Respondents before this court, the circular had provided for re-

structuring the salaries, service grades and promotional procedure.

This court on several occasion had held that registered trade unions have no locus standi to come

before the Supreme Court for alleged violation of the fundamental Rights of its membership. In this

7 regard I am mindful of the decision in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association V. Ranawaka

SC FR 18/2015 SC minute dated 03.05.2016 where Sripawan CJ held;

In the absence of a provision permitting a Trade Union to institute action on behalf of its

members, the Petitioner Union cannot have and maintain this application on behalf of its

members in terms of Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

However, in the said decision in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association (Supra)

Sripawan CJ had observed the difference in the decision in the said case with the decision in the Public

Services United Nurses Union Vs. Jayawickrema and Others (1988) 1 Sri LR 229 as follows;

I do not find myself able to accede to the argument advanced by Mr. for two reasons.

Firstly, no objection was taken by the Respondents in the said application that the Public

Services United Nurses Union had no locus standi to institute an application under Article 126

of the Constitution and the Court did not have the benefit of any argument of the learned

Counsel on that issue. Secondly, in any event, the second Petitioner was a Nurse and the

Secretary of the First Petitioner Union, whose fundamental right of equality guaranteed under

Article 12 had been violated. Furthermore, the second Petitioner is a person within the

meaning of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. Thus, the case could have proceeded even if the

first Petitioner, namely Public Service United Nurses Union was struck down.

The Respondents raised several objections with regard to the Locus Standi of some of the Petitioners

before this Court including the 8th Petitioner namely the Sri Lanka Accountants Service Association.

However as observed in the case of Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association (Supra) first to

the seventh Petitioners being members of the said Association and the Sri Lanka Accountants Service,

who claimed that their fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

8 Constitution had been violated, the said Petitioners are entitled to peruse the instant application

before this court.

The objection with regard to the locus standi of the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners namely, D.H.B.

Edirisinghe and P.M. Ratnapala was that they were retired from the service, when the instance

application was filed before this court.

However, as observed by this court the said two Petitioners were retired from the service on dates

subsequent to 01.01.2006, on which date the Circular had come into effect, and the said Petitioners

were entitled to claim the benefits of the circular for their pension rights.

In the said circumstances, I see no merit in the said objection raised on behalf of the Respondents.

According to the 1st to the 7th Petitioners, they all were belonging to an All- Island Service namely the

Sri Lanka Accountants Service, when the circular was issued and except for the 1st and the 2nd

Petitioners, all the other Petitioners were in Class I of the said service when the instant application was

filed before this court.

The Petitioners have explained their service structure, prior to 01.01.2006 as follows;

Structure of the service-

a) Class I

b) Class II Grade I

c) Class II Grade II (recruitment level)

Promotions within the service-

a) 10 years of satisfactory service in Class II Grade II is required for an officer to be

eligible for promotion to Class II Grade I

9

b) 5 years of satisfactory service in Class II Grade I is required for an officer to be

eligible for promotion to Class I

(P2a)

As submitted by the Petitioners, there need to be an amendment to the above structure, with the issue

of the Circular, but due to the delay in implementing the Circular 3rd Petitioner along with few

other Petitioners belonging to different All-Island Services, instituted proceedings before the Supreme

Court to compel the authorities to implement the provisions of the Circular

The said application, SC FR 312/2008 was settled between the parties when the Respondents agreed

in court for the relief prayed in paragraph C be granted, i.e.

C. Direct the 1st to the 14th Respondents to amend the service minutes of the Sri Lanka

Engineering Service, Sri Lanka Animal Production and Health Service, Sri Lanka Planning

Service, Sri Lanka Accountants Service and the Sri Lanka Agriculture Service as required

by the promotional procedure set out in Clause 4 of annexure II of Public Administration

Circular 06/2006 with effect from 01.01.2006

As revealed before us, the Circular had provided for a four-tear structure for All- Island Services and

the structure proposed by the Circular was;

a) Special Grade

b) Grade I

c) Grade II

d) Grade III (recruitment level)

The main grievance of the Petitioners before this court was based on the appointments made to the

Special Grade referred to above and the Petitioners rested their entire case to the Service minute, that

10 was introduced in September 2010, by publishing on 10th September 2010 in the Gazette extraordinary

1670/33. The said service minute replaced the existing service minute which was published in the

Gazette (extraordinary) No 1194/26 dated 27th July 2001 and was issued in order to implement the

recommendations of the Circular.

The Petitioners have taken up the position that, an officer belonging to the Grade 1 of the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service as at 01.01.2006 is entitled under Clause 19.1 of the new service minute which is

the transitional Provision, read with Clause 10.3 to be appointed to the Special Grade if he fulfills the

requirements referred to in those provisions.

For the convenience of reference, I will now re-produce the above clauses in my Judgment.

10.3 Promotion form Grade 1 to Special Grade

10.3.1 Promotion to Special Grade will only be made by a designated officer authorized by the

Public Services Commission or by Cabinet of Ministers from the officers in the Grade I

of the Service who fulfill following requirements.

Accordingly, an officer-

i. Should have completed satisfactory period of service in the Grade I during the

preceding five (5) years of gaining eligibility for promotion and should have earned all

salary increments on due dates;

ii. Should not have undergone any punishment as a result of disciplinary inquiry taken

place for an offence committed during the preceding five (5) years of gaining eligibility

for promotion (excluding warnings);

11

iii. Should have achieved above satisfactory performance during the five (5) years

preceding the date of promotion in terms of the approved performance evaluation

scheme;

iv. The promotions to the Special Grade shall be made based on recommendations of the

board of interview appointed by the appointing authority to check whether the above

qualifications have been fulfilled. Date of promotion will be the due date of gaining

eligibility.

10.3.2 Officers who fulfills all requirements stipulated in Section 10.2.1 1(v) and 10.3.1 above

will be promoted to the Special Grade from the date of gaining eligibility,

10.2.1.1(v) Referred to above reads as follows;

10.2.1.1(v) Should have completed any one of the qualifications set out in Appendix 5

Appendix 5 Referred to above gives a list of qualifications that are equallent to post graduate

degree qualification

19 Transitional provision;

19.1 (a) Officers who are in Service on the effective date will be absorbed into the re-organized

Sri Lanka Accountants Service as follows;

19.1.a (iv) Absorption into Special Grade of the Service. Officers who are in Class I of the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service and have fulfilled qualifications set out in section 10.3.1 and

having completed qualification as at the date of implementation.

a) Possession of a Postgraduate Diploma or higher qualification from recognized

university or from an institute approved by the University Grants Commission.

12

b) Having passed Part I or higher level of the final examination of the Institute of

Chartered Accountants or Part III or higher level of Chartered Institute of

Management Accountants.

Whilst relying on the above provision of the new service minute read with Clause 6.1, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners argued that there was no cadre assigned to the Special Grade

by the service minute and according to the service minute the combined cadre of Sri Lanka

Accountants Service should be 1600. In the absence of an identified number of officers in any of the

cadres including Grade III to Grade I and Special Grade, it was the position of the Petitioners, that the

officers belonging to each Grade is entitled to be promoted to the next Grade when he/she fulfill the

requirements identified in the service minute and the same principle will apply even to the promotions

to Special Grade.

As further submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel, the post graduate requirement identified in

Clause 10.2.1.1(v) is not applicable to the petitioners since Transitional Provisions in Clause 19 had

reduced the said requirement to

a) Possession of a Post Graduate Diploma or higher qualification from recognized

University or from an institute approved by University Grants Commission.

b) Having passed Part I or Higher level of the final examination of the Institute of

Chartered Accountants or part III or higher level of Charted Institute of Management

Accountants.

and the officers who possessed the said qualification and fulfill the other requirements identified in

Clause 10.3.1 including the Petitioners, were entitled to be promoted to the Special Grade without any

cadre restriction.

13 The Petitioners whilst submitting the above position, relied heavily on the Cabinet Memorandum and

a decision which was produced marked P6a and P6 respectively. In the said Cabinet decision, it was

decided;

i. To implement the new minutes of the Sri Lanka Planning Service and the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service to be effective from 01.01.2006; and

ii. To grant promotions to officers with requisite qualifications in accordance with the

provisions of the relevant service minutes, without payment of arrears of salary up to

30.06.2010

By another Cabinet paper dated 23.02.2011 an Interview Panel was proposed to be appointed to

check the qualifications of those who are eligible to be promoted to the Special Grade and the said

paper was approved by the Cabinet on 31.03.2011 (P10a and P10b)

The grievance or the alleged violation, the Petitioners have complained before this court had

emerged since then and the Petitioners have submitted several documents in support of their

contention. Some of the documents the Petitioners relied in establishing their grievance is as

follows;

P-11 letter by Deputy Secretary Treasury addressed to the Secretary Public Service

Commission dated 16.06.2011 seeking approval for the interview board (as per the

Cabinet decision) to check the qualifications of 166 applicants for the Special Grade

P-12 letter dated 07.07.2011 addressed to Deputy Secretary Treasury by the Senior Assistant

Secretary to the Public Service Commission granting the approval to conduct the

interview subject to submitting an explanation with regard to the approved cadre for

the Special Grade, prior to conducting the interviews.

14

P-13 letter dated 12.10.2011 by the Deputy Secretary Treasury to the Secretary Public

Service Commission informing that a committee had been appointed to identify the

cadre for the Special Grade and Grade I of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service

P-14 letter dated 4th November 2011 by the Senior Assistant Secretary to the Public Service

Commission to the Deputy Secretary Treasury, informing not to conduct any interviews

for the promotion of Grade I officers of the Sri Lanka Accusants Service to the Special

Grade until the cadre of the Special Grade is informed to the Public Service Commission

P-15 letter dated 13.12.2011 by the Deputy Secretary Treasury to the Secretary Public

Service Commission informing that the New Service minute for the Accountants Service

provides a Non-Cadre base promotion scheme and therefore seeking permission to

conduct the interviews

P-16 letter dated 31st January 2012 by Senior Assistant Secretary Public Service Commission

to the Deputy Secretary Treasury re-iterating the requirement to finalize the cadre for

the Special Grade of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service prior to conducting the

interviews.

Since then, several letters had been exchanged between the General Treasury and the Public

Service Commission and the Public Service Commission had finally issued the impugned Gazette

1865/36 dated 6th June 2014 (P-25) making the following changes to the existing service minute.

a. identifying the posts to be held by a Special Grade Officer as,

a) Deputy Chief Secretary (Financial)

b) Chief Financial Officer

c) Director General

d) Additional Director General

15

b. identifying the Joint Cadre for Grade I to Grade III of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service as

1600.

c. replacing Clause 10.3.1. of the existing service minute to read as;

10.3.1 Appointment to Special Grade is approved by the Public Service Commission only

by promoting officers of the Grade 1 who have fulfilled the following requirements.

i. Should have obtained a Post Graduate Degree in relevant field

ii. Should have completed five (5) years of active and satisfactory service in Grade

I of the Executive Service Category and should have earned five increments

after promotion to Grade I as to the date of gaining eligibility for promotion.

iii. Should have completed not less than 18 years of active service period in the

Executive Service Category of the related service category/posts as at the date

of gaining eligibility for promotion

iv. Should have attained a performance at satisfactory level or above within the

period of 05 years immediately preceding to the date gaining eligibility for

promotion.

v. Should have a satisfactory service period and should not have been subjected

to disciplinary punishment within the period of 05 years immediately preceding

to the date of gaining eligibility for promotion.

According to the Petitioners the effect of the amendments introduced to the existing service minute

was to;

a) Limit the entire cadre of 1600 personnel of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service only to

Grades I, II and III

16

b) Insist that all promotions to the Special Grade (and/or absorption as the case may be)

irrespective of whether they be ordinary promotions and/or transitional period promotions

and/or transitional period absorptions be granted only to officer who inter alia possess

a Postgraduate Degree in the relevant field and

c) Determine that promotions to the Special Grade will be made only to fill vacancies in the

Special Grade,

Petitioners have further submitted that, based on the amendments made to the service

minute, the Public Service Commission had permitted to hold the interview for the promotion and/or

adsorption of Grade I officers of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service to the Special Grade and 82

handpicked officers were called to face the interview but, none of the Petitioners who were eligible

to face the interviews based on the earlier Cabinet decision were among the 82 officers summoned to

face the interview.

Based on the above submissions placed before this Court, the Petitioners argued that, the amendment

made to the Service minute of the Sri Lanka Accounts Service by the Public Service Commission

(P-25) without obtaining the permission of the Cabinet of Ministers and without consulting the Director

General Management Services, National Salaries and Cadre Commission and the relevant stake holders

including the 8th Petitioner, is arbitrary, illegal and in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12.1 of the Constitution.

Whist raising a preliminary objection on locus standi of some of the Petitioners, which I have already

considered in this judgment, the Respondents resisted the granting of any relief in the instant

application. The in-cumbent Chairmen of the Public Service Commission, the 16th Respondent, filed an

affidavit along with several documents to explain the steps taken by the Public Service Commission in

17 this regard, but before analyzing the same, this court would prefer to consider some of the documents

the Petitioners have submitted along with papers already filed before this court.

The Petitioners produced marked P2a, the service minute which existed at the time the Circular was

issued on 25-04.2006, but as per the Circular it was operative since 01.01.2006. Therefore, P2a was

operative only up to 31.12.2005. According to P2a, there were only 3 Grades in the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service Namely Class II Grade II, Class II Grade I and Class I. Clause 5 (a) of the said service

minute identified the Cadre of the said service as follows;

Class I -122

Class II-Grade I

-1224

Class II-Grade II

As observed by this court, the highest grade under the previous service minute was Class I, and Cadre

of 122 was identified for the said Grade separate of the combine cadre of 1224 for the balance two

grades including the recruitment Grade. In these circumstances, it is not correct for the Petitioners to

argue that the promotions in the Sri Lanka Accountants Service is not cadre base but it is automatic

within the combine cadre.

The new service minute introduced in year 2010 (effective from 01.01.2006) provided for four Grades

and Clause 6.1 and 6.2 identified the cadre as follows;

6.1

Grade III

Grade II 1600

Grade I

Special Grade

18 6.2 No of Combined Officers :1600 (Grade III, II and I)

When consider the above provisions in the new service minute, it is once again clear, that the three

lower grades in the service had put together to a combine cadre of 1600 keeping the Special Grade

separately but no cadre had been identified for the Special Grade under the new service minute.

In these circumstances, I cannot agree with the argument placed before this court by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, that the new service minute had also provided a non-cadre

base promotion scheme based on a combine cadre of 1600 for the Sri Lanka Accountants Service. As

further observed by this court, the combine cadre of 1600 is only for Grade I, II, and III of the said

service and not for the Special Grade.

As revealed during the argument before us, the Public Service Commission was not in operation when

the service minute of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service was published by the Secretary to the Ministry

of Finance and Planning in the Government Gazette Extra Ordinary 1670/30 dated 2010.09.10

The Minister in charge of the Subject of Finance and Planning had submitted a Cabinet Memorandum

in order to obtain the approval to the service minute and to grant promotions to officers who are

entitled for promotions to higher Grades. (P6a) The Cabinet of Ministers by its decision dated

23.03.2010 had approved the said request as follows; (P6)

i) To implement the new service minute of the Sri Lanka Planning Service and the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service to be effective from 01.01.2006; and

ii) To grant promotions to officers with requisite qualifications in accordance with the provisions

of the relevant service minutes, without payment of arrears of salary up to 30.06.2010

When going through the above documents it is clear, that the approved service minute did not have

the cadre for the Special Grade and therefore the approval granted cannot be implemented without

19 an amendment to the service minute. Even though the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners

argued that the Public Service Commission is bound to implement the policy decision of the Cabinet of

Ministers and therefore any amendment made to the service minute by the Public Service Commission

is ultra vires and arbitrary, this court cannot agree with the said argument for the simple reason that

the Public Service Commission being the Appointing Authority since it is re-constituted on 12.06.2011,

will not able to appoint anybody to a Grade which does not have a cadre identified in its creature

itself. In the said circumstances, it is the duty of the Public Service Commission to amend the service

minute in consultation with the relevant stake holders.

When P10 was submitted by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning requesting to

nominate an interview panel, to conduct interviewers to promote Grade I officers belonging to the Sri

Lanka Accountants Service to the newly established Special Grade of the said Service, the said

memorandum was considered and approved under sub-heading 59.07 by the Cabinet under the main

heading 59; Institutional work that has to carried out by the Cabinet of Ministers until the Public

Service Commission is appointed.

In the said circumstances, it is clear, that the approval granted by the Cabinet of Ministers to hold

interviews as proposed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning does not come within

the Policy Decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Public Service Commission was re-constituted on 12th June 2011 and since then all appointments,

transfers dismissal and disciplinary control of Public Servants and all matters relating to the same,

including work entrusted to the Public Service Commission by its procedural rules, was to be carried

out by the Public Service Commission.

20 The steps Public Service Commission has taken with regard to the appointments to the Special Grade

of the Sri Lanka Accounts Service has been explained by the Respondents as follows;

a) Special Grade is a grade created by the circular for officers in All Island Services and in all such

services, the appointment to the Special Grade is not automatic but based on Cadre Vacancies.

b) In the Service minute of the Sri Lanka Accountant Service, which was published by the

Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning in 2010, a separate cadre for Special Grade

was not identified

c) Cabinet of Ministers had granted approval to conduct interviews to promote officers belonging

to the Grade I to Special Grade of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service, prior to Constitute the

Public Service Commission, but the Commission approval was sought to continue with the

interview by letter dated 16.06.2011.

d) In the absence of a specific Cadre identified in the service minute, the relevant authority was

instructed to identify the cadre for the Special Grade before conducting the interviews. These

instructions were given to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning who published

the service minute and also obtained cabinet approval to conduct interviews for the promotion

to the Special Grade, in order to maintain equal standard between the All-Island Services.

e) Even though approval was sought to hold interviews subject to the identification of the cadre

by a special committee appointed for that purpose, the said approval was not granted.

However, prior to the approval being granted to conduct the interviews, several preliminary

issues such as finalizing the qualifications required and the transitional provisions that will

applicable for the promotions to the Special Grade (R7, R8) were resolved.

f) By letter dated 23.11.2012, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the Public Service

Commission informing that 45 posts had already being identified as posts for Special Grade

Officer and submitted 33 approvals the Ministry received from the Department of

21

Management Service, and sought approval to conduct Interviews, after publishing the

necessary advertisements.

g) Subsequent to the conduct of the interviews by calling applications, summoning the 82

applicants who had applied with required qualification, 41 names were recommended to the

Public Service Commission by the Deputy Secretary Treasury by letter dated 30.06.2014 (R-10).

h) Even thereafter several letters were exchanged between the relevant stake holders to grant

the maximum relief to all those who had the necessary qualifications to be promoted to the

Special Grade and in this regard, the transitional period that has to be expired on 31.12.2014

was extended until 28.02.2015.

i) The Department of Management Service had approved a cadre of 47, for the Special Grade and

that too was published in the Gazette Extraordinary 1981/99 dated 27.08.2016.

j) Whilst the interview process was commenced after following the due process and finalizing

other matters such as applicability of the transitional provisions to those who had the requisite

qualifications, the necessary amendments were made to the service minute of the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service in keeping with standard between All Island Services by publishing the

amendments in the Government Gazette extraordinary 1856/36 dated 6th June 2014 but

Clauses 19 and 20 were not subject to any amendment and continued to be in force until the

end of the extended period referred to above.

During the argument before this court, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the relevant

stakeholders such as Department of Management Services, Directors Establishment were not

consulted by the Public Service Commission when amending the service minute but we cannot agree

with the said argument since there is material before this court that, there were consultations between

the Public Service Commission, Ministry of Finance and the Department of Management Service in

identifying the cadre for the Special Grade of the Sri Lanka Accounts Service.

22 Petitioners challenged the steps that has been taken by the Public Service Commission to amend the

service minute already approved by the Cabinet of Ministers by its decision dated 23.03.2010 and

argued that the Public Service Commission did not have the power to amend the service minute, to

introduce cadre vacancy requirement, as P 5, constitute a policy decision of the Cabinet of Ministers.

When considering the above argument, it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the

Constitution which refers to the powers and functions of the Public Service Commission and the

Cabinet of Ministers with regard to the Public Service.

At the time the service minute was approved by the Cabinet in the year 2010, the applicable text of

the Constitution was the 17th Amendment and Article 55 (1) and 55 (4) of the 17th Amendments were

as follows;

Article 55 (1); Appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officer

shall be vested in the Commission.

Article 55 (4); Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet Ministers shall provide and

determine all matter of policy relating to public officers.

The above two Sub Articles were replaced in the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and subsequent

to the said Amendment the relevant Sub Articles of the Constitution reads as follows;

Article 55 (1): The Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters of policy relating

to public officers, including policy relating to appointments, promotions, transfers,

disciplinary control and dismissal.

23 Article 55 (3); Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the Public Service

Commission.

Whilst referring to the difference between the two texts in the relevant Articles, on behalf of the

Respondents it was argued that, in the text that was operative in 2010, the Cabinets policy making

power specially, with regard to appointments, promotions and transfers was narrowed in contrast to

the broader policy making power introduced by the 18th Amendment.

However, I am not inclined to accept the above argument since the policy making power with regard

to the Public Service was never entrusted to the Public Service Commission but was with the Cabinet

of Minister, whatever the language used in the relevant Article, whether it was more elaborated by

identifying specific functions or identified as all matters of policy relating to public officers.

As further observed by me, the policy with regard to appointment to the highest grade of the Sri Lanka

Accountants Service is very much clear when perusing the two service minutes of the above service.

As already observed in this judgement, the highest grade under the old service minute was Class I and

a separate cadre of 122 was identified for this grade in the service minute. In the new service minute,

a combine cadre of 1600 was identified for the three lower grades, i.e., Grade III, Grade II and Grade I

but no cadre was identified for the Special Grade. If the Cabinet was to identify the Special Grade within

the combine cadre, there was no restriction on the Cabinet to do so and include the Special Grade

within the combine cadre.

Therefore, it is crystal clear that the Government Policy with regard to the appointments to the highest

grade was to make it cadre base to an identified cadre but not within a combine cadre. Therefore,

24 identifying a specific cadre for the Special Grade cannot be considered as a violation of the Government

Policy with regard to the appointments to the Sri Lanka Accountants Service.

When a specific cadre is identified to a Specific Grade there is a competition to enter into the said

Grade. Conducting a routine interview to check the qualifications will not be sufficient in such a

situation. The amendments made to the New Service Minute by the Public Service Commission had

further clarified this position and therefore that too cannot be considered as a violation of the

Government Policy.

In the said circumstances, it is my considered view, that P-25 the amendments made to the service

minute of the Sri Lanka Accountants Service by Publishing in Gazette Extraordinary 1865/36 date

06.06.2014 is not in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the 1st to 7th

Petitioners.

Application is accordingly dismissed.

I make no order with regard to the costs.
