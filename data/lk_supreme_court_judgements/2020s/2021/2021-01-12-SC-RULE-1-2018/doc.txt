Pradeep Mahamuthugala.

Registrar of the Supreme Court”

Pradeep Mahamuthugala called by the Attorney General gave evidence. He stated

in his evidence that he is the Registrar of the Supreme Court; that the Rule in this

case was served on the Respondent on 8.8.2018 and the plea of the Respondent has

been recorded.

Gayan Sampath called by the Attorney General gave evidence and stated the

following facts. He was the News Director in Sirasa TV on 21.8.2017. Dhananjaya

Naranbedda and Lucknuwan have been assigned to cover the activities near

Temple Trees on 21.8.2017. They forwarded a video which contained a statement

made by Ranjan Ramanayake the Respondent in this case on 21.8.2017 near

Temple Trees. He examined the said video and published it in Sirasa News at

10.00p.m. Later on a directive by the Supreme Court, he submitted the DVD/CD

6

containing the said video to the Supreme Court. This video was replayed in court.

After watching the video, he identified it as the DVD/CD that he submitted to the

Supreme Court. This DVD/CD was marked and produced as P1. However, the

witness admitted that P1 was an edited version. The contents of the DVD/CD have

been typed and the said document was marked as P2. It contained among other

things the following words. “Majority in Sri Lanka are corrupted judges, corrupted

lawyers. They work for money.‟ (,xldfjs nyq;rhla bkafka lrmagvs jsksiqrejre. lrmagvs

f,dah¾ia,d. Tjqka i,a,s j,g jev lrkafka.)

Luck Nuwan Dhanushka Warnakulasuriya called by the Attorney General gave

evidence and stated that on 21.8.2017, he being the cameraman attached to the

Sirasa TV videoed a programme in which Ranjan Ramanayake (the Respondent in

this case) made a statement; that he forwarded it to Gayan Sampath, the News

Editor in Sirasa TV; that Dhanajaya Naranbedda assisted him in operating the

microphone; and that this video is produced as P1.

Dhanajaya Naranbedda called by the Attorney General stated in evidence that he

operated the microphone and assisted Luck Nuwan Dhanushka Warnakulasuriya

who videoed the programme in which Ranjan Ramanayake made a statement and

that the said video is the video produced as P1. He further said that Ranjan

Ramanayake did not, on any occasion, ask him as to why he did not record good

things said about judges by him (Ranjan Ramanayake).

Sudeva Hettiarchchi called by the Attorney General stated in evidence that he is

the News Director in Hiru Television and Hiru Radio; that the members of the Hiru

Television record activities and speeches made by various people in a Microchip;

that he examines it before publishing it; and that he decides to publish an edited or

unedited version of the activities and speeches made by people. He further stated in

7

evidence that on 21.8.2017 he received a Microchip recorded by Eranda

Gunawardena who is a member of Hiru Television and that after editing, it was

televised for the 1st time in Hiru Television on 12.10.2017 after the proceedings

against the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake commenced in the Supreme Court. He

produced the unedited video of the said speech of Ranjan Ramanayake and its

transcript in this court as P3 and P4. He stated in evidence that the said video

contained a statement made by the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake on 21.8.2017.

This video was replayed in court. It contained among other things the following

words made by the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake. “Majority in Sri Lanka are

corrupt Judges. Corrupt lawyers. About 95%. They work for money. They

everyday protected murderers, corrupt people and drug dealers for money.”(,xldfjs

above words are also contained in the transcript of the video (P3) marked as P4. He

stated in evidence that P3 is the unedited statement made by the Respondent

Ranjan Ramanayake on 21.8.2017. He further stated in evidence that the edited

version of the statement made on 21.8.2017 by the Respondent Ranjan

Ramanayake was televised in Hiru Television on 12.10.2017. He produced the said

edited version and its transcript marked as P5 and P6. P5 was replayed in open

court. P6 contained the following words. “Majority in Sri Lanka are corrupt

Judges. Corrupt lawyers. About 95%. They work for money. They everyday

protected murderers, corrupt people and drug dealers for money.” He further

stated that the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake outside the Supreme Court

building made several statements. He produced the said video as P7 and its

transcript as P8. P7 was replayed in open court. P7 and P8 reveal the following

matters.

8

1. On14.12.2017 the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake has said the

following words. “I will not, under any circumstances, withdraw the

opinion expressed by me. Therefore I told only about these Judges.” (uu

2. On 23.3.2018 the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake has said the following

words. “If the Honourable court gets some self satisfaction to conclude it

after sending me to jail, I will very happily go. I will not withdraw

anything what I have said.” (.re wOslrKhg huslsis iajhx jskaokhla ;sfhkjdkus

3. On 4.6.2018 the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake has said the following

have said.” (ug kvq oekg 21 la ;sfhkjd. uu lshmq l;dj uu b,a,d wialr

words. “I will never withdraw. I maintain the opinion that I am correct.”

(uu ljodj;a b,a,d wialr .kafka keye. uu bkafka ksjeroshs lshk u;fha.)

5. On 5.9.2018 the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake has said the following

words. “I will never withdraw. Even if they sentenced me to one year,

two years, five years, ten years, twenty years or life imprisonment, I

maintain what I have said.” (wdhs b,a,d wialr.kafka keye cSjsf;ag. fus wh

All the above statements have been made outside the Supreme Court building but

in the premises of the Supreme Court.

Under cross-examination he (Sudeva Hettiarchchi) admitted that the words „a‟, „a‟

and „me‟, „me‟ are not found in P3. However we note that the words „a‟, „a‟ and

9

„me‟, „me‟ are found in document marked P2. P2 is a transcript of P1. P1 is the

video which contained the statement made by the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake

and was published in Sirasa News at 10.00p.m.

Witness Eranda Gunawardena said that he, as cameramen of Hiru Television was

waiting outside the Temple Trees on 21.8.2017; that he recorded what the

Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake said outside the Temple Trees on 21.8.2017; and

that the said video is produced as P3.

Wickramage Ajith Wickramasinghe called by the Attorney General stated in

evidence that he, as the court correspondent of Hiru Television, videoed the

statement made by the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake outside the Supreme Court

building on several occasions and that he produces the said video as P7 but did not

record what the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake said on 21.8.2017 outside the

Temple Trees. The said video P7 was replayed in open court. He stated that the

said video P7 contained the statement made by the Respondent Ranjan

Ramanayake on 21.8.2017, 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and

5.9.2018. He further stated in evidence that he videoed what the Respondent

Ranjan Ramanayake said outside the Supreme Court building on 14.12.2017,

23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018. The said video was marked as P7.

According to P7, the statements alleged to have been made by the Respondent

Ranjan Ramanayake on 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018

outside the Supreme Court building respectively are as follows.

1. “I will not, under any circumstances, withdraw the opinion expressed by

me. Therefore, I told only about these Judges.” This witness in evidence

confirmed that the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake made the above

statement on 14.12.2017.

2. “If the Honourable court gets some self satisfaction to conclude it after

10

sending me to jail, I will very happily go. I will not withdraw anything what

I have said.”

3. “As at present I have twenty one cases. I will not withdraw what I have

said.”

4. “I will never withdraw. I maintain the opinion that I am correct.”

5. “I will never withdraw. Even if they sentenced me to one year, two years,

five years, ten years, twenty years or life imprisonment, I maintain what I

have said.”

This witness (Wickramage Ajith Wickramasinghe) in evidence confirmed that the

Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake made the above statements. He, under cross-

examination, admitted that the words „pardon me‟ used by the Respondent Ranjan

Ramanayake are missing in the video relating to 14.12.2017.

The Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake gave evidence under oath. He stated that he

is a Member of Parliament and a non-Cabinet Minister. He further stated that he

was a film actor; that he entered politics in the year 2006; that in the Parliamentary

Election held in August 2015 he was elected as a Member of Parliament from

Gampaha District; that from August 2015 to date he represents Gampaha District;

that as at present he is a State Minister; that he has produced films regarding

corrupt politicians; that he entered politics in order to send corrupt politicians to

jail; that in the ten year period of his politics he was not accused of any corruption;

that he refused to accept two vehicles sent to him by the Government; that he

refused to accept enhancement of attendance allowance given to the Members of

Parliament and enhancement of salary given to the Members of Parliament; and

that he does not enjoy privileges given to the Members of Parliament. He further

stated in his evidence that on 21.8.2017 after attending a meeting at Temple Trees

11

he addressed the journalists and said that 95% of Judges and lawyers are corrupt;

that although he said the above words, he had no intention of mentioning of Judges

but had the intention of speaking about lawyers; that when he made the above

statement to the journalists, his intention was to criticize the former Minister of

Justice and talk about lawyers; that when he used the word „Judges‟ he changed it

saying „me, me‟; and that in the said interview held on 21.8.2017 outside the

Temple Trees no question arose about Judges.

Thereafter, at the request of Mr. Sumanthiran President‟s Counsel appearing for

the Respondent, video marked P7 was replayed in open court. Mr. Sumanthiran

President‟s Counsel questioned the Respondent Ranjan Ramanayake if his

intention was not to mention about Judges as to why he made a statement on

14.12.2017 stating that he would not withdraw what he said earlier. He (Ranjan

Ramanayake) then said that his statement made on 21.8.2017 has some truth when

the statements made by former Chief Justices were considered. He again said that

it was not his intention to refer to Judges when he made the statement on 21.8.2017

outside the Temple Trees. He further stated in his evidence that on 14.12.2017,

23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018 he mentioned about good Judges such

as Neville Samarakoon Chief Justice and Sarath Ambepitiya but these portions of

his statements had been removed by Hiru TV.

Ranjan Ramanayake further stated in his evidence that on 21.8.2017 when he made

the statement outside the Temple Trees, he did not want to speak about Judges but

the word „Judges‟ slipped from his mouth. He further stated in his evidence that

when he makes statements to the electronic media, he has his own team to record

what he says. Whilst Ranjan Ramanayake was giving evidence, P1 which is a

CD/DVD recorded by Sirasa TV was replayed in open court. He (Ranjan

12

Ramanayake) admitted in the witness box that P1 contains what he said on

21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees. P2 which is a transcript of P1 was shown to

him whilst he was giving evidence in the witness box. He admitted that P2 contains

what he said on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees. P1 and P2 contain among

other things the following words.

“Majority in Sri Lanka are corrupted Judges, corrupted lawyers. They work for

money.”

Whilst he (Ranjan Ramanayake) was giving evidence in the witness box, P3 which

is a CD/DVD recorded by Hiru TV was replayed in open court and P4 which is a

transcript of P3 was shown to him. He went through P4. He admitted that P3 and

P4 contain what he said on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees.

Whilst he (Ranjan Ramanayake) was giving evidence in the witness box, P5 which

is a CD/DVD recorded by Hiru TV was replayed in open court and P6 which is a

transcript of P5 was shown to him. He went through P6. He admitted that P5 and

P6 contain what he said on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees.

Whilst he (Ranjan Ramanayake) was giving evidence in the witness box, P7 which

is a CD/DVD recorded by Hiru TV was replayed in open court. He admitted that

P7 contains the statements made by him on 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018,

18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018 in court premises but outside the Supreme Court building.

He admitted in evidence that the word „Judges‟ in his statement made by him on

21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees was a mistake. He also admitted that he did

not correct this mistake in his subsequent statements made by him in court

premises outside the Supreme Court building on 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018,

18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018. The defence of the Respondent (Ranjan Ramanayake) is

that he had no intention to refer to Judges and reference to Judges in his statement

made on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees was a mistake. If that is so, he could

13

have easily corrected this mistake and apologized for the mistake in his subsequent

statements made on 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and 5.9.2018. But

he did not do so. For the above reasons, we reject his defence. His evidence does

not create any reasonable doubt in the case presented against him. Although

Ranjan Ramanayake says in his evidence that he had had no intention to refer to

Judges in his statement made on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees, his

subsequent statements made on 14.12.2017, 23.3.2018, 4.6.2018, 18.6.2018 and

5.9.2018 indicate and clearly demonstrate that his intention was to refer to Judges.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the respondent contended that according to the

evidence led before this court, nothing had been said against the Supreme Court

and that therefore the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this

case. We now advert to this contention. Although learned President‟s Counsel

contended so, according to the evidence, the respondent has said that the majority

of Judges in Sri Lanka are corrupted Judges. Thus the above statement of the

respondent refers to the Judges of the Supreme Court as well. Therefore the above

contention of learned President‟s Counsel should fail.

Article 105(3) of the Constitution reads as follows.

“The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of

the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and shall

have all the powers of such court including the power to punish for contempt

of itself, whether committed in the court itself or elsewhere, with

imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. The power of the

Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any other

court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph (1)(c) of this Article,

whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere :

14

Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice or

affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other court,

tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itself.”

According to the above Article, the Supreme Court has the power to deal with the

offence of contempt of court whether the offence of contempt of court was

committed in court or elsewhere. Therefore the above contention of learned

President‟s Counsel for the Respondent should fail. Further it is noted that the

objection to the jurisdiction of this court was taken up after closure of the

Respondent‟s case. For the purpose of clarity, we would like to state here that this

objection was taken up only when learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent

was making his final submission. It is an accepted principle that the objection to

the jurisdiction should be taken up at the very inception of the case. This view is

supported by the following judicial decisions. In Nagalingam Vs Lakshman De

Mel 78 NLR 231 this court held as follows.

“Further the Petitioner, having participated in the proceedings without any

objection and having taken the chance of the final outcome of the

proceedings, is precluded from raising any objection to the jurisdiction of

the Commissioner of Labour to make a valid Order after the zero hour. The

jurisdictional defect, if any, has been cured by the Petitioner's consent and

acquiescence.”

In The King Vs Kitchilan 45 NLR 82 Court of Criminal Appeal held as follows.

“Even if there had been a misjoinder of charges, the Court would have

dismissed the appeal as no embarrassment or prejudice had been caused to

the accused. In such a case the Court of Criminal Appeal has a wider

discretion than that conferred upon an Appellate Court under section 425 of

15

the Criminal Procedure Code. The proper time at which an objection of the

nature should be taken is before the accused has pleaded.”

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the procedure laid

down in Section 792 and 793 of the Civil Procedure Code should have been

followed in this case. The said section reads as follows.

Section 792: In all courts the summary procedure to be followed for the

exercise of the special jurisdiction to take cognizance of contempt and to

punish summarily offences of contempt of court, and offences declared by

this Ordinance to be punishable as contempt of court, shall be that which is

prescribed in the sections next immediately following.

Section 793: The court shall issue a summons to the accused person in the

form No. 132 in the First Schedule or to the like effect, which summons shall

state shortly the nature of the alleged offence and the information or

grounds upon which the summons is issued, and shall require the accused

person to appear before the court on a day named in the summons to answer

the charge.

In the present case, the charge was read to the Respondent and an opportunity was

given to him to plead or not to plead guilty to the charge. He pleaded not guilty to

the charge. The evidence against him was led in open court and his counsel was

given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. The respondent was given an

opportunity to call witnesses. The respondent too gave evidence. Thus the

respondent was given the freedom of a fair trial which is in my view more than the

procedure laid down in Section 792 of the Civil Procedure Code. For the above

reasons, we reject the above contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the

Respondent.

16

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent cited Section 38 of the Penal

Code. It reads as follows.

1) Except in the Chapter and sections mentioned in subsections (2) and (3), the

word "offence" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.

2) In Chapter IV. and in the following sections, namely, sections 67, 100, 101,

101A. 102, 103, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113.113A, 113B.184,

191, 192,200,208,210, 211, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 318, 319, 320. 321,

322, 338, 339, 377, 378, and 431, the word "offence" denotes a thing

punishable in Sri Lanka under this Code, or under any law other than this

Code.

3) And in sections 138, 174. 175, 198, 199, 209, 213, and 427, the word

"offence" has the same meaning as in subsection (2) when the thing

punishable under any law other than this Code is punishable under such law

with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards, whether with or

without fine.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent citing Section 38 of the Penal

Code contended that the offence of contempt of court has not been made

punishable by any law. We now advert to this contention. Is the offence of

contempt of court punishable by any law? To answer this question, we would

consider Article 105(3) of the Constitution. We would again like to state Article

105 (3) of the Constitution. It reads as follows.

“The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of

the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and shall

have all the powers of such court including the power to punish for contempt

of itself, whether committed in the court itself or elsewhere, with

imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. The power of the

17

Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any other

court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph (1)(c) of this Article,

whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere :

Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice or

affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other court,

tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itself.”

The words “the power to punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the

court itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem

fit” in the above Article should be stressed. The above Article clearly states that a

person who committed the offence of contempt of court can be punished with an

imprisonment. In this regard we would like to consider definition given to the

offence in the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code

defines the offence as follows.

“Offence means any act or omission made punishable by any law for the

time being in force in Sri Lanka;”

The act of contempt of court has been made punishable by Article 105(3) of the

Constitution. Therefore the act of contempt of court is an offence and this offence

is punishable with an imprisonment or a fine.

Lord Denin MR in the case of In Re Bramblevale Ltd [1970] 1CH 128 held as

follows.

“A contempt of court is an offence of a criminal character. A man may be sent

to prison for it.”

In the case of Croos Vs Dabrera [1990] 1SLR 205 Court of Appeal held as follows.

“The offence of contempt of court under our law is a criminal charge and

the burden of proof is that of proof beyond reasonable doubt.”

When we consider all the aforementioned matters, I reject the above contention of

18

learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent cited Perera Vs The King 1951

AC 482. In the said case Perera being a Member of the House of Representative of

Ceylon paid a visit to the Remand Prison in Colombo and made the following

observation in the Prison Visitors‟ Book.

“Visited Remand Prison in the company of Jailor Wijewardena. Premises

clean. Adequate library facilities required. The present practice of appeals

of Remand prisoners being heard in their absence is not healthy. When

represented by Counsel or otherwise the prisoner should be present at

proceedings. In my opinion not more than one prisoner should be in a cell

(7x9) approximately.”

The Commissioner of Prisons later forwarded the above remarks to The Registrar

of the Supreme Court asking for his observation. The Registrar of the Supreme

Court forwarded the above remarks to a Judge of the Supreme Court who was in

charge of unstamped petitions from prisoners in jail and His Lordship made the

following minute.

“The statement is incorrect and is a contempt of the Court. Issue a rule on

Perera returnable on Tuesday the 25th. I shall sit specially on that day.”

Mr. Perera was found guilty of contempt of court and a sentence was imposed on

him. The Privy Council in appeal set aside the conviction and the sentence and

held as follows.

“Finally his criticism was honest criticism on a matter of public importance.

When these and no other are the circumstances that attend the action

complained of there cannot be Contempt of Court.”

19

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Respondent citing the above judicial decision

contended that Mr. Perera in the above case did not make any reference to a Judge.

He further contended that in the present case, the respondent did not make any

reference to a Judge and that therefore the respondent cannot be convicted for the

offence of contempt of court. But we would like to state here that according to the

evidence led in this court, the respondent has said the following words. “The

majority in Sri Lanka are corrupted judges.” Further the Respondent on a later

occasion (14.12.2017) has said the following words. “I will not, under any

circumstances, withdraw the opinion expressed by me. Therefore I told only about

these Judges.” (uu lshmq u;h bj;a lr.kafka keye lsisf,ilskaj;a. ta yskaod ud lsjsfjs fus

jsksiqrejre .ekuhs.)

Thus it is clear that the respondent has spoken about Judges. When we consider all

the above matters, we hold the view that the above contention does not hold water.

The charge levelled against him is that he committed the offence of contempt of

court when he made the statement on 21.8.2017 outside the Temple Trees. He

admitted in his evidence that he said the following words when he made the above

statement. “Majority in Sri Lanka are corrupted Judges, corrupted lawyers. They

work for money.”

We have earlier rejected his defence. For the above reasons, we affirm the Rule

served on the Respondent and hold that the charge of contempt of court levelled

against him has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

For the aforementioned reasons, we convict him for the offence of contempt of

20

court punishable under Article 105(3) of the Constitution and sentence him to a

term of four (4) years rigorous imprisonment. The Registrar of this court is

directed to issue a warrant committing the Respondent to prison to a term of four

(4) years rigorous imprisonment.
