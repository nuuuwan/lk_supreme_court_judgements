PETITIONER-RESPONDENT

Before: MURDU N. B. FERNANDO PC J

P. PADMAN SURASENA J

A. H. M. D. NAWAZ J

Counsel: S. N. Vijithsing for the Respondent-Appellant

Lasantha Mudalige for the Petitioner-Respondent.

Argued on: 18-02-2021

Decided on: 23-06-2021

P. Padman Surasena J The Petitioner - Respondent filed the Petition dated 13-12-2011 and an Affidavit in the

High Court of Colombo praying for a decree, in accordance with the award dated 22-

02-2011, made in the arbitration, held in accordance with the agreement between the

Petitioner - Respondent and the Respondent Appellant. The purpose of the decree so

prayed by the Petitioner – Respondent, was to enforce the said arbitral award in terms

of Section 31 of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995 (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as ‘the Arbitration Act’ or ‘the Act’).

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 3 of 9

Opposing the above claim, the Respondent - Appellant filed his Statement of

Objections dated 07-08-2012 praying inter alia for an order to set aside the said

arbitral award and for the dismissal of the Petition of the Petitioner-Respondent.

After the inquiry, the learned Judge of the High Court by his order dated 10-12-2012,

directed to enforce the said arbitral award and enter a decree as per the said arbitral

award.

The Respondent - Appellant thereafter filed the Notice of Appeal dated 24-12-2012,

and subsequently also filed a Petition of Appeal addressed to this Court dated 31-01-

2013 which includes a prayer to set aside the aforesaid order of the High Court.

It is noteworthy that the said Petition of Appeal does not disclose any legal provision

by virtue of which the Respondent - Appellant could have become entitled to file such

an appeal to this Court.

When the said appeal was taken up before this Court for argument, the learned

Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner - Respondent raised a preliminary objection

to the maintainability of this appeal stating that there is no legal provision which

enables the Respondent-Appellant to file such an appeal to this Court against the

impugned order of the High Court. In other words, it was the submission of the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner - Respondent that the law has not provided a right of appeal

for the Respondent - Appellant in the instant case.

The Respondent - Appellant has lodged the instant appeal against an order made by

the High Court under section 31 (1) of the Arbitration Act which states as follows.

“A party to an arbitration agreement pursuant to which an arbitral award is made

may, within one year after the expiry of fourteen days of the making of the award,

apply to the High Court for the enforcement of the award.”

Section 31 (6) of the said Act has set out, as to what the High Court must do when

such an application is made.

It reads as follows.

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 4 of 9

“Where an application is made under subsection (1) of this section and there is

no application for the setting aside of such award under section 32 or the court sees

no cause to refuse the recognition and enforcement of such award under the

provisions contained in sections 33 and 34 of this Act, it shall on a day of which notice

shall be given to the parties, proceed to file the award and give judgment according

to the award. Upon the judgment so given a decree shall be entered”.

To ascertain whether any appeal lies against an order made by the High Court under

section 31 of the Act, one has to consider the provisions in section 37 of the Arbitration

Act.

Section 37(1).

“Subject to subsection (2) of this section no appeal or revision shall lie in respect of

any order, judgment or decree of the High Court in the exercise of its Jurisdiction

under this Act except from an order, judgment or decree of the High Court under this

Part of this Act”.

The High Court has pronounced the judgment impugned in the instant appeal under

section 31 of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995. The said section (s. 31) is in Part VII

of the said Act which according to its heading, deals with the applications to courts

relating to awards (including recognition and enforcement of foreign awards). As

section 37 is also in part VII of the Act, the phrase”this Part of this Act” in section

37(1) is a reference to part VII of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, it is only under section

37 (2) of the Act that an appeal could, if at all, lie to this Court in the instant case.

However, an appeal would be possible under section 37(2) only if the Supreme Court

grants leave to appeal on a question of law.

The said provision is as follows.

Section 37(2).

“An appeal shall lie from an order, judgment or decree of the High Court referred to

in subsection (1) to the Supreme Court only on a question of law and with the leave

of the Supreme Court first obtained”.

This means that the Respondent - Appellant in the instant case should necessarily

have first obtained the leave of the Supreme Court in respect of the instant appeal.

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 5 of 9

Moreover, the Respondent - Appellant should also have submitted a question of law

for the consideration of the Supreme Court for granting of leave. Admittedly, the

Respondent - Appellant has not done any of the above. In the above circumstances

this Court is unable to consider the instant appeal as an appeal filed under section 37

of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995.

It would be appropriate to refer to the case of Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Vs.

Million Garment (Pvt) Ltd,1 at this stage. In the said case, the Supreme Court was

called upon to decide on the time limit for filing applications for leave to appeal under

Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act. The learned counsel who appeared for the

respondent in that case, raised a preliminary objection stating that the application for

leave to appeal was time-barred as the judgment of the High Court was pronounced

on 14th May 2012, and the application for leave to appeal was lodged in the registry

of this Court on 26th June 2012 (on the forty-third day after the pronouncement of the

impugned judgment). He therefore argued that the petitioner in that case had filed

the said application for leave to appeal outside the time limit prescribed by law, for

filing of such applications. His Lordship Saleem Marsoof PC J having considered the

provisions relevant to the issue at hand, stated as follows.

“…. I am fortified in my decision that an application for leave to appeal challenging a

decision of the High Court to file of record an arbitral award and pronounce judgement

and enter decree accordingly has to be lodged within six weeks of the said judgment

and decree, since the language of Section 37 (1) of the Arbitration Act manifests a

clear legislative intent to curtail appeals from orders and awards of arbitral tribunals

with a view to giving full effect to the concept of party autonomy and maintaining the

efficacy of the arbitral process. More so, because Section 37 (2) of the said Act seeks

to confine appeals to any order, judgement or decree of the High Court made under

Part VII of the Act relating to the enforcement and setting aside of arbitral awards by

limiting them to those involving a question of law and imposing the further

1 SC (HC) LA 58/2012; Decided on 24.10.2014.

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 6 of 9

requirement of obtaining the leave of the Supreme Court for proceeding with the

same, with the same objectives in mind. …..”

The learned counsel for the Respondent - Appellant, Mr. Vijith Sing conceded that the

Respondent - Appellant has not first obtained the leave of the Supreme Court on a

question of law in the instant appeal. However, he thereafter submitted that this Court

nevertheless has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal both under Article 127 of the

Constitution and in the exercise of revisionary powers of this Court. It is to the said

arguments I would now turn.

Article 127 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is as

follows.

“127. (1) The Supreme Court shall, subject to the Constitution, be the final Court of

civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction for and within the Republic of Sri Lanka for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the Court of Appeal

or any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and the judgements and

orders of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive in all such

matters.

(2) The Supreme Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, have sole and exclusive

cognizance by way of appeal from any order, judgement, decree, or sentence made

by the Court of Appeal, where any appeal lies in law to the Supreme Court and it may

affirm, reverse or vary any such order, judgement, decree or sentence of the Court of

Appeal and may issue such directions to any Court of First Instance or order a new

trial or further hearing in any proceedings as the justice of the case may require, and

may also call for and admit fresh or additional evidence if the interests of justice so

demands and may in such event, direct that such evidence be recorded by the Court

of Appeal or any Court of First Instance.”

Article 127 (2) sets out what this Court can do in the exercise of its appellate

jurisdiction and therefore the said Article comes into operation only when it considers

an appeal lawfully filed before it.

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 7 of 9

Article 127 (1) has specifically subjected itself to the other provisions of the

Constitution. This is clear from the wording “The Supreme Court shall, subject to the

Constitution,..” , found in that Article.

Thus, Article 127 (1) must be read with Article 128 of the Constitution. This is because

Article 128 is another provision in the Constitution which has specified several channels

through which any appeal can reach this Court.

It is as follows.

Article 128

“(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final order, judgement, decree

or sentence of the Court of Appeal in any matter or proceedings, whether civil or

criminal, which involves a substantial question of law, if the Court of Appeal grants

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved

party to such matter or proceedings;

(2) The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory order, judgement, decree, or sentence

made by the Court of Appeal in any matter or proceedings, whether civil or criminal,

where the Court of Appeal has refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,

or where in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for review by

the Supreme Court:

Provided that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in every matter or

proceedings in which it is satisfied that the question to be decided is of public or

general importance.

(3) Any appeal from an order or judgement of the Court of Appeal, made or given in

the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 139, 140, 141, 142 or 143 to which the

President, a Minister, a Deputy Minister or a public officer in his official capacity is a

party, shall be heard and determined within two months of the date of filing thereof.

(4) An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court on any matter and in the manner

specifically provided for by any other law passed by Parliament.”

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 8 of 9

As Article 128 (1), (2), (3) refers only to orders or judgements of the Court of Appeal

they have no relevance to the instant case as it is an appeal against an order made

by the High Court. Thus, the provision applicable to the instant case is clearly Article

128 (4) of the Constitution and the ‘law passed by parliament’ relevant to the instant

case is section 37 in part VII of the Arbitration Act.

I have already dealt with that section and held that the Respondent - Appellant in the

instant case, has not first obtained, the leave of the Supreme Court on a question of

law, as required by that section and therefore the instant appeal is not an appeal filed

under section 37 of the Arbitration Act.

For the above reasons, I have no hesitation to reject the above argument that this

Court nevertheless has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under Article 127 of the

Constitution.

Although the learned counsel for the Respondent - Appellant, Mr. Vijitha Sing,

submitted that this Court has jurisdiction to consider this appeal in the exercise of its

revisionary powers, this Court has not been vested with such power by any law. Mr.

Vijith Sing, also did not refer to any provision of law under which this Court could have

exercised such revisionary power. In my view there is no merit in this argument and

it should suffice to say that ‘the Supreme Court is a creature of statute and its powers

are statutory’ as stated by His Lordship Amerasinghe J in the case of Jeyaraj

Fernandopulle vs. Premachandra De Silva and Others.2

In the case of Mahesh Agri Exim (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Gaurav Imports (Pvt) Ltd and Others,3

this Court had to consider the question whether this Court has revisionary jurisdiction

against orders made by the Commercial High Court. I had the privilege of agreeing

with His Lordship Justice Priyantha Jayawardena who stated in that case, the

following.

2 1996 (1) SLR 70. 3 SC Revision No. 02/2013 Decided on 30-07-2019.

(SC CHC Appeal 14/2014) - Page 9 of 9

“The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that a grave prejudice has been caused to

his client and therefore, the Supreme Court should intervene in this matter. He further

submitted that this is a fit and proper case to exercise revisionary jurisdiction and/or

inherent powers of this Court.

We are of the opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain Revision

applications arising from the orders made by the Commercial High Court. Further, the

inherent powers of this Court cannot be entertained in this application.”

Thus, I am of the view that this Court does not have revisionary powers to intervene

and consider the instant appeal. For the foregoing reasons, I uphold the Preliminary

Objection raised by the Respondent - Appellant. I proceed to dismiss this Appeal.
