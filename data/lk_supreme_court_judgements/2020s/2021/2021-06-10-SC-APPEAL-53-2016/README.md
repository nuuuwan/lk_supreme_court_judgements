Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two Plaintiffs filed this action against the three

Defendants seeking a declaration that the land in suit is

being held in trust by the Defendants for the two Plaintiffs

and the two minor children of the 2nd Plaintiff. At the trial,

the Defendants raised a preliminary question of law to the

maintainability of the action on the premise that the alleged

cause of action of the Plaintiffs is prescribed in law. The

District Court held that the cause of action is not prescribed.

It also stated in passing that in any event, prescription does

not run against the two minors. The case was refixed for

further trial.

5

On appeal, the High Court held that the action against the

two Plaintiffs is prescribed but not against the two minors,

and therefore the Order of the District Court is correct.

The Plaintiffs did not appeal against this Judgment but the

Defendants did. This Court granted leave to appeal on the

question whether the High Court erred in law when it decided

to allow the action to proceed on the basis that prescription

does not run against the two minors when the alleged minors

are not parties to the case.

The Plaintiffs have not made the minors parties to the action

notwithstanding they seek Judgment in favour of themselves

and the minors. The Court knows nothing about the two

alleged minors not even their names, gender or age.

Without any information, how can the Court pronounce

Judgment in favour or against the minors?

When the High Court decided that the action of the two

Plaintiffs is prescribed and the two Plaintiffs accepted that

decision by not appealing against it, the Plaintiffs have no

locus standi to maintain this action. After the above finding,

there is no live action.

If the Plaintiffs want to maintain the action on behalf of the

alleged two minors, there is a special procedure laid down in

the Civil Procedure Code to follow. No such procedure was

followed by the Plaintiffs in this case.

According to section 476 of the Civil Procedure Code, every

action by a minor shall be instituted in the name of the minor

by an adult person who in such action shall be designated in

the plaint as the next friend of the minor. Section 477 of the

Civil Procedure Code is also to similar effect. Such

particulars shall appear in the caption of the pleadings.

6

In this case, the minors have not been named as Plaintiffs nor

are they represented in Court through a next friend.

It shall be noted that any adult person cannot file a case on

behalf of a minor with or without declaring himself the next

friend. The appointment of next friend shall be made by the

Court. The legislature in its wisdom has introduced such a

procedure to safeguard the interests of minors.

According to section 481 of the Civil Procedure Code, a

person of sound mind and full age is eligible to be appointed

next friend of a minor, if his interest is not adverse to that of

the minor and he is not a Defendant in the action. Such

appointment has to be made on application by way of

summary procedure supported by affidavit showing the

required qualifications. The Defendant shall be made

Respondent to the application, and the minor shall appear in

Court when the application is made unless prevented by good

cause.

For the purpose of disposing of this appeal, there is no

necessity to analyse all the provisions in law with regard to

next friends, but suffice it to say that the Civil Procedure

Code inter alia provides for the removal of next friends.

The brief outline above goes to show that unless there is a

formal appointment made by Court, a person cannot

represent a minor in Court in the guise of safeguarding the

interests of the minor. What I stated above is applicable

when an action is filed by a minor.

The same is true when an action is filed against a minor, in

which event the Court shall, under section 479 of the Civil

Procedure Code, appoint an adult as guardian to defend the

action on behalf of the minor.

7

The High Court was in error when it held that the Plaintiffs

can continue with the action (despite their action being

prescribed) as the reliefs have also been prayed on behalf of

the minors. I answer the question of law in respect of which

leave was granted in the affirmative.

The Judgment of the High Court insofar as it allowed the

Plaintiffs to continue with the action on behalf of the minors

is set aside and the appeal is allowed. The Plaintiffs action in

the District Court shall stand dismissed. The Defendants are

entitled to costs in all three Courts.
