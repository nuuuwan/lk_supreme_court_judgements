BEFORE : L.T.B. DEHIDENIYA, J. A.L.S. GOONERATNE, , J. ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J. COUNSEL : Upul Kumarapperuma with Muzar Lye and Ms. Radha Kuruwitabandara instructed by Ms.Darshika Nayomi for the Petitioners. Senany Dayaratne with Ms.Nishadi Wickramasinghe for the 18th 27C Respondents. Ms. Sureka Ahamed S.C. for the 1st to 17th & 31st Respondents. ARGUED ON : 26th March, 2021 DECIDED ON : 26th November, 2021 ******** ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an application filed by fifty-two Petitioners, who invoked

the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 126(1) of the

Constitution, alleging that they legitimately expected to gain admission

to the Faculty of Music of the University of the Performing and Visual

Arts (the 1st Respondent University), since they possess the requisite

qualifications for admission, as stipulated in the admission policy

published by the 18th Respondent Commission (The University Grants

Commission) in its handbook P2 (UGC Handbook). Despite the

Petitioners eligibility to be selected for University admission, it is

alleged that one of more Respondents, in selecting students for

admission, had acted contrary to the said published admission policy,

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

14

by inclusion of students who have failed to satisfy the said admission

criterion. Hence the Petitioners claim that the said

administrative/executive act of the Respondents is in violation of their

fundamental right to equality as guaranteed under Article 12(1).

The Petitioners sat for the Advanced Level Examination held in

August 2018, offering three subjects in the Arts stream and have

secured Z-scores, which made them eligible to seek admission to a State

University. The Petitioners have aspired for admission to the Faculty of

Music of the 1st Respondent University for the academic year

2018/2019, as undergraduates of the degree Bachelor of Performing

ArtsMusic (Special). They have accordingly tendered their applications

to the 18th Respondent Commission, in compliance with the instructions

contained in the said UGC Handbook.

The entry requirements to the Faculty of Music in the 1st

Respondent University, as stipulated in the UGC Handbook, are that

each student to have sufficient Z-score, at least a Credit pass for the

subject of Music and also to pass the mandatory aptitude test

conducted by the 1st Respondent University, under its bylaws. The

Petitioners have taken the mandatory aptitude test, conducted by a total

of 20 Judges who sat in four separate panels. Those four panels had

examined supportive documents in their skills and abilities, subjected

them to a viva voce examination and assessed them in singing and

instrumental performances. In May 2019, they were informed in writing

by the 1st Respondent University that they had passed the aptitude test.

When the 18th Respondent Commission had eventually released

the names of the 250 students, who had been selected for admission to

the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent University, the Petitioners

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

15

found that their names were not included in that list. The Petitioners

claim that in August 2019 they learnt that some of the students, who did

not pass the said mandatory test, were selected for admission to the 1st

Respondent University for admission by the 18th Respondent

Commission, leaving them out. It is also alleged that the 30th

Respondent is one such student, who had been selected to the Faculty

of Music of the 1st Respondent University, despite being failed from the

mandatory aptitude test and they were unaware whether the 28th and

29th Respondents too were selected to the said faculty.

In alleging violation of their fundamental rights, the Petitioners

claim that consideration of the applicants who failed in the mandatory

aptitude test, being the foremost requirement that needed to be complied with

and the subsequent selection of them to the final list of 250 students to be

enrolled to the 1st Respondent University by the 18th Respondent, over the

Petitioners who have passed the mandatory test by obtaining 50 or above

marks is violative of their right to equality.

The Petitioners further allege that the 18th Respondent

Commissions failure to consider only the 360 students, inclusive of the

52 Petitioners, who scored 50 or more marks and pass the mandatory

aptitude test, coupled with the act of making selections contrary to the

declared admission policy, as contained in the UGC Handbook, by

considering students who ought not to have been considered for

admission to the 1st Respondent University. The Petitioners further

allege that the decision of the said Commission is therefore illegal,

unfair, arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of their legitimate

expectation to be enrolled to the said University.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

16

In resisting the Petitioners application, the 2AA Respondent,

being the Competent Authority of the 1st Respondent University, takes

up the position that the said application is misconceived in law and

they had failed to establish any violation of their fundamental rights.

In his statement of objections, it is averred that the 18th

Respondent Commission, had directed the 1st Respondent University to

conduct an aptitude test, in order to select students for admission. This

was in conformity with the admission policy as published in the UGC

Handbook. The Senate of the 1st Respondent University had thereupon

approved a set of guidelines under which the said aptitude test is to be

held. It also stipulated that the pass mark at 50. Of the 787 students

who had taken part in the aptitude test, only 360 students had obtained

marks above 50 and only their names were sent to the 18th Respondent

Commission in the first instance. The said Commission then insisted

that the 1st Respondent University comply with the requirement of

sending three times the proposed intake, as indicated in its letter P16(i),

which compelled the 1st Respondent University to bring down pass mark

to 26 and to prepare a 2nd list of 393 names of students, based on that

revised pass mark.

In the statement of objections of the 19A Respondent, the

incumbent Chairman of the 18th Respondent Commission, in seeking

dismissal of the Petitioners application, had averred that their

application is without merit or basis and they have no entitlement,

either in law or in fact, to have and maintain the instant application.

In clarifying the applicable criterion in selection of students for

admission to the 1st Respondent University, the 18th Respondent

Commission states that it places primacy on the individual Z-score of

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

17

each student, in making selections for University admissions, based on

the District Quota, in addition to All Island Merit Quota, in conformity

with the national policy for University admission. Therefore, it was

imperative to the 1st Respondent University to tender a list of 750 names

of students, which is three times in value to the actual intake, in order to

apportion the placement of students in terms of the said quota system.

This is a requirement imposed by the 18th Respondent Commission on

all the Universities that conduct aptitude tests.

It is further stated by the 19A Respondent that the marks of the

aptitude test conducted by each such University, despite being a

mandatory requirement, is only a secondary consideration and

therefore does not supersede the primary consideration, namely the

individual Z-score obtained by each student, at the G.C.E. Advanced

Level examination. It is also stated by the said Respondent that the

students have already had practical tests in the relevant subjects, such

as music, in that examination.

The requirement of three times the proposed number was

necessitated due to the national policy imperatives and therefore the

pass mark of 50 as stipulated by the 1st Respondent University, at best,

is only a notional figure and not determinative. Since the proposed

intake for the degree in Music was 250, the 18th Respondent

Commission required 750 names of students who had passed the

aptitude test to make the selection. He further asserts that the pass mark

of the aptitude test could not be pre-determined, as the 1st Respondent

University did in this particular instance, since it essentially is a variable

figure, which is dependent upon the marks obtained by the said 750th

student.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

18

He further alleges that setting up of a pass mark is a nullity as it

had not been set up according to the by-laws of the 1st Respondent

University. He further states that the intake of students for the Faculty

of Music of the 1st Respondent University consists of students who have

been selected from both these lists sent by the said University and the

18th Respondent Commission had, in fact, utilised both these lists to

reconcile and adjust the District Quota, adhering to the National Policy.

When the Petitioners have supported their application on

04.08.2020, this Court granted leave to proceed on their allegation of the

violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Court also made order

granting interim relief, as prayed for by the Petitioners, by issuance of a

stay primarily on the admission process, initiated by the 1st Respondent

University on the selections of students made by the 18th Respondent

Commission.

At the hearing of this application, learned Counsel for the

Petitioners contended that the decision of the 18th Respondent

Commission to consider the Z-scores of the students, who have failed

the aptitude test, contrary to its published admission criterion, is illegal,

unfair, arbitrary and unreasonable.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioners had founded his contention

on the premise that once the 1st Respondent University has forwarded

the list of names of the students, who have passed the test in the order

of merit, the 18th Respondent Commission then selects the mark obtained

by the 250th applicant in the said list and sets the Z-score received by the 250th

applicant as the final cut off Z-score for the enrolment of applicants to the

Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent for the respective year and

accordingly the 250 applicants selected to the Faculty of Music in the 1st

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

19

Respondent University, first and foremost pass the mandatory aptitude test

and then subsequently must satisfy the minimum Z-score set by the 18th

Respondent . He added that the said Commission had failed to

provide with a substantial justification for disregarding the results of

the mandatory aptitude test, lowering of the pass mark, changing the

selection criteria laid down by the 1st Respondent University, in making

the selection of students for admission.

In view of these factors, learned Counsel for the Petitioners had

contended that the 18th Respondent Commission had prevailed upon

the 1st Respondent University, compelling it to lower the threshold

mark, in order to accommodate the students who did not initially pass

the aptitude test. He submits that it is an act that should be regarded as

a clear interference with the authority of the 1st Respondent University

over its academic affairs and therefore ultra vires. It was his contention

that the said departure from the declared admission policy had

forestalled the Petitioners legitimate expectations to be admitted to the

Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent University and thereby violated

their right to equality.

The Petitioners have made the allegation of right to equality on

frustration of their legitimate expectation, in denying admission to the

Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent University contrary to the

declared admission policy. The Petitioners totally rely on the admission

policy as published in the UGC Handbook in support of their

contention. Therefore, it is relevant to consider as to how the Petitioners

have perceived the admission procedure, as described in the UGC

Handbook.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

20

The Petitioners perception of the selection process of 250

students to the Faculty of Music are found in paragraphs 8 to 15 of their

petition. The Petitioners assert therein that the 250 vacancies for

students are to be filled by the ones who have obtained at least a Credit

pass to the subject of music, in addition to two Ordinary passes at the

Advanced Level Examination. Upon fulfilment of the said basic

requirement, the Petitioners state that a student then had to qualify

the mandatory aptitude test conducted by the 1st Respondent University

according to the Universitys own guidelines. Once the 1st Respondent

University conducts the aptitude test, it would then constructs a list of

the applicants who have passed the aptitude test, in the order of the highest

receiving mark, and refer the same to the 18th Respondent. Having received

the said list, the 18th Respondent Commission, then, selects the mark

obtained by the 250th applicant in the said list and sets the Z-score received by

the 250th applicant as the final cut off Z-score for the enrolment of applicants to

the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent for the respective year. The

Petitioners further state accordingly the 250 applicants selected to the

Faculty of Music in the 1st Respondent University, first and foremost pass the

mandatory aptitude test and then subsequently must satisfy the minimum Z-

score set by the 18th Respondent .

It would appear from the above quoted segments of the petition,

that it reflects the reading of the Petitioners as to the declared policy on

the selection process the 18th Respondent had published in the UGC

Handbook and therefore the policy it must adopt, in making selection

of students for admission to the Faculty of Music. The 18th Respondent

Commission, however asserts that the primary determinant factor is the

Z-score and not the individual marks received by a student at the

aptitude test, as the Petitioners contend.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

21

In view of these conflicting claims, it is necessary for this Court to

examine the admission process of the 18th Respondent Commission as

described in the said UGC Handbook, particularly in relation to the

interplay of the marks of the aptitude test and the individual Z-score of

each student.

The UGC Handbook issued by the 18th Respondent Commission

consists of 10 sections. Section 1 dealt with the overarching policies and

principles governing selection for admission to undergraduate degree

programs conducted by the State Universities and such other

institutions. In Kaviratne and Others v Commissioner General of

Examination and Others 2012 [B.L.R.] 139 at p. 150, it was stated that

The Hand Book issued by the University Grants Commission becomes an

important Source Book for the students who are aspiring to commence higher

studies in a National University.

The description of subjects at G.C.E. (A.L.) that made a particular

student eligible to enter the 1st Respondent University is indicated in the

UGC Handbook (at p.35) as it states a student wishing to follow Music

must have a Credit pass or more in Music in the Advanced Level

Examination. It also states that The University also conducts

practical/aptitude tests for selection. These are for Music, Dance, Drama and

Theatre and Visual Arts. The examination is conducted under the by-laws of

the university. Importantly, it is further stated in the said UGC

Handbook (at p.36) If a student fails the practical/aptitude test he/she is

deemed ineligible for admission for the relevant course of study.

There is no dispute that all of the 52 Petitioners have satisfied the

minimum entry requirements that are needed to be satisfied, inclusive

of the pass at the aptitude test, in order to be considered for admission

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

22

to the 1st Respondent University. Since the dispute among the parties

revolves around the results of the aptitude test, the statement that If a

student fails the practical/aptitude test he/she is deemed ineligible for admission

for the relevant course of study, needed to be considered in a little more

detail.

The said sentence is obviously had been constructed in the

negative form, for it indicates that the failure of the aptitude test is

deemed to be a disqualification for university admission rather than

passing of the aptitude test is taken as a qualification. However, what is

important is that statement does not offer an undertaking or a promise

of benefit to any prospective student that passing of the aptitude test

alone is sufficient for University selection. It is thus fair to infer that the

said sentence was intentionally inserted into the UGC Handbook by the

18th Respondent Commission, after taking extra care not to create a

hope or a promise for a placement upon merely passing the aptitude

test.

But the UGC Handbook also states that the aptitude test is

conducted under the by-laws of the university.

The origin of the alleged violation of right to equality, based on

frustration of legitimate expectation, could easily be traced to the initial

decision of the 1st Respondent University, to consider only the students

who scored 50 or more in the aptitude test, as students who have

passed the said test. The 1st Respondent University seeks to justify its

action of setting up a pass mark of 50, on the basis that the aptitude test

conducted by it under the by-laws of the University, and that should be

given adequate weightage, in the selection of students for admission to

the aesthetic courses of study it conducts. When the 18th Respondent

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

23

Commission instructed it to send the names of students who have

passed the test, it is entitled to determine the threshold of a pass mark,

at which point the distinction of pass or fail could be made.

The Petitioners have pushed that position another step further

when they contended that the selection should primarily be based on

the order of merit of the results of the aptitude test and the cut-off point

of the Z-score should also be decided by picking the Z-score of the

student, who was placed at the 250th position, in the said test. It is

therefore contended by the Petitioners, that when the 18th Respondent

Commission directed the 1st Respondent University to conduct an

aptitude test under the by-laws of the University, that University had

the power to set the pass mark and decided 50 as the pass mark for the

aptitude test in 2018.

The 19AA Respondent, in his objections had stated that the Pass

Mark for the aptitude test cannot be pre-determined, as the 1st

Respondent University did in this particular instance and could be

determined only on the mark received by the 750th candidate. The

requirement of the names of students who passed the aptitude test,

three times the proposed intake, is insisted by the 18th Respondent

Commission, because of the applicable national policy imperatives.

The Petitioners position that the 1st Respondent University, being

an autonomous institution, had the authority to conduct the aptitude

test under its own by-laws and also to set up a pass mark to the said

test. They further contend that the 18th Respondent Commission had

interfered with the affairs of the Senate of the 1st Respondent

University, the academic authority of the said University, when it

intervened to lower the pass mark set by the University and thereby

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

24

admitting students who had not met the required aesthetic competence

contrary to section 46 of the Universities Act. This alleged act of

interference, which the Petitioners have termed as an act of the 18th

Respondent Commission, in ultra vires of its powers.

It was also contended by the Petitioners that the 1st Respondent

University must accordingly decide the pass mark of a student and the

18th Respondent Commission must accordingly accept the 1st list that

had been sent containing only 360 names of students, who have scored

above 50 marks for the aptitude test. The Petitioners claim that the said

Commission had no power to call for a list of 750 names. Learned

Counsel, in the course of his submissions stressed the point that the

students who are admitted to the 1st Respondent University should

possess an inherent aesthetic talent and hence it was important for the

18th Respondent to give adequate weightage to the assessment of the

said University had on such talents of the students.

In the objections of the 2AA substituted Respondent, it is

indicated that the Senate of the said University had approved a set of

guidelines for the conduct of the aptitude test in respect of the course of

study in music, and made it effective from 2018 and applicable in

relation to the aptitude test held in 2019 as well. The Senate also

decided that a student should score from all segments of the aptitude

test, a minimum of 50 marks in total (2R2). It is claimed that the said set

of guidelines were made available to the students.

Learned State Counsel who appeared for the 1st Respondent

University, contended that when the 18th Respondent Commission

directed the 1st Respondent University to send the names of the

students who have passed the aptitude test, the University must first

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

25

determine if a student had passed the test and it can make such a

determination only by having a bench mark and therefore a pass mark

of 50 was set up. In view of this fact, she submitted that the 18th

Respondent Commission should not be permitted to fault the

University for fixing a pass mark, in order to determine if a student had

passed the aptitude test, as it was done in compliance with the

instructions contained in P16(i). In her reply to the Petitioners

contention, she also submitted that if the 18th Respondent Commission

had not intended the 1st Respondent University to determine a pass

mark for the aptitude test, then the Commission should have issued

clear instructions of what is expected of the 1st Respondent University.

In the absence of such instructions, she submitted that the 18th

Respondent Commission should not be allowed to find fault with the

University for complying with their badly drafted directions,

contained in P16(i)/X2/2R4.

It is the position of the 19A Substituted Respondent that for

certain selected disciplines, subject to the objects and powers of the 18th

Respondent Commission entrusted to it under the Universities Act No.

16 of 1978 as amended, the relevant Universities are empowered to

conduct an aptitude/practical test for students and the 1st Respondent

University is one such University. It is specifically stated by the said

19A substituted Respondent that the sole objective of the said

aptitude/competency test is to select the candidates that would be forwarded to

the 18th Respondent for processing, from and amongst the students who have

applied to the relevant course of study. Consequently the pass mark at the said

test would be based on the number of students that the 18th Respondent

requires for the purpose of making its selections.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

26

The contention of the Learned Counsel for the 18th Respondent

Commission, was that the pass mark of the aptitude test cannot be pre-

determined as it is dependent on the mark obtained by the 750th

student, since the 750 names of the students who passed the aptitude

test are warranted by the National Policy imperatives. Therefore, he

contends that the pass mark of 50, that had been initially indicated by

the 1st Respondent University, in relation to the aptitude test, is a

decision which the 18th Respondent was not informed of, and therefore

should be considered as notional at its best and not determinative on

the selection for admission.

It is evident from the above that the submissions made by the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners and submissions of the Learned

State Counsel who appeared for the 1st Respondent University are at

variance with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the 18th

Respondent Commission as to the practicality and legality of setting up

of a pre-determined pass mark of 50 to the aptitude test, that had been

conducted in response to the direction issued by the 18th Respondent

Commission with P16(i).

It is advisable that these aspects are considered at the very outset

of the judgment, before I venture out to other contentious areas.

When the 18th Respondent directed the 1st Respondent University

to call for applications and to conduct practical/aptitude tests by its

letter dated 16.01.2019 (2R4), it was acting under the powers conferred

under sections 3(5) and 15(vii) of the Universities Act, as amended.

Importantly, this letter also directs the then Vice Chancellor of the said

University to send the lists of names of the students who have passed the

practical/aptitude tests on or before 16th April 2019, indicating the full name,

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

27

index number of the A/L Examination 2018 and the National Identity Card

Number, as a soft copy as well as a hard copy. Importantly, make sure that you

send three times the proposed intake of students who have passed the practical/

aptitude tests from each course of study for the academic year 2018/2019.

The 1st Respondent University, after calling applications from the

Petitioners and other students, conducted an aptitude test during the

time period commencing from 01.03.2019 and ending with 05.04.2019. It

then compiled a list of 330 names of students, who have received 50 or

more marks in that test. In compliance with the direction on 09.05.2019,

the 1st Respondent University had then forwarded the details of the

students who have passed in the practical test consisting of those 336

names of students, inclusive of the names of the Petitioners, instead of

sending a list consisting of three times the proposed intake of students, as

required by the 18th Respondent in 2R4.

The 19th Respondent, in view of the partial compliance of his

direction by the 2nd Respondent, reminded the latter that you are

required to send three times the proposed intake of students who have passed

the practical /aptitude test and had redirected him to take immediate

actions to send the details of not less than three times the proposed intake of

students who have passed the practical /aptitude test. It is said that this

requirement was insisted upon due to the policy imperatives in

University admission. It is important to note the emphasis placed by the

18th Respondent Commission on the requirement of sending three times

the proposed intake of students who have passed the aptitude test in

the said letter 2R4.

On 27.05.2019, the 1st Respondent University had then forwarded

another 393 names of students after compiling a 2nd list, in addition to

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

28

the 360 names that had already been sent to the 19AA Respondent (X5)

by its 1st list. In the covering letter of the 2nd list, the then Vice

Chancellor of the 1st Respondent University informed the 19th

Respondent, the then Chairman of the Commission, that we were

compelled to bring down the pass mark of the aptitude test to fulfil the proposed

intake. This letter also conveyed his disapproval of the insistence of 750

names, as it indicated that it is unfortunate that we would have to enrol

students to the UPVA based on the Z-score requirement, but not on the marks

they obtained in the aptitude test.

However, the 1st and the 2nd lists sent by the 1st Respondent

University indicate that all 750 names sent to the 18th Respondent

Commission are of the students who have passed the practical /aptitude

test. Thus, the 2nd list consisting of 393 names of students are students

who have also been termed by the 1st Respondent University as

students who have passed the aptitude test, contrary to the claim of the

Petitioners that the Commission had admitted students who have

failed in the aptitude test conducted by the 1st Respondent University.

The Petitioners claim that the 1st Respondent University has the

power to decide the admission requirements of students, a position

strongly countered by the 18th Respondent Commission. Thus, it is

necessary to refer to the statutory provisions contained in the

Universities Act in relation to the power to admit students to the

Universities under the purview of the 18th Respondent Commission.

Section 3(5) of the said Act recognises that the regulation of the

admission of students to each Higher Educational Institution; as one of

the objects of the 18th Respondent Commission while section 15(vii) had

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

29

conferred power on it to select students for admission to each Higher

Educational Institution, in consultation with an Admissions Committee.

In contrast, section 29 confers power to the Universities,

including the 1st Respondent University, but they are to be exercised

subject to the powers, duties and functions of the Commission. It states

that a University shall have power;

(a) to admit students and to provide for instruction in any

approved branch of learning;

(b) to hold examinations for the purpose of ascertaining the

persons who have acquired proficiency in different

branches of learning

Thus, it is clear that the 18th Respondent Commission alone has

the power to select students for admission to the Universities and other

Higher Educational Institutions, while the Universities that are under its

purview were obligated to admit such students who had been selected

by the said Commission, based on the national policy of selecting

students to be admitted to the State Universities. This Court, in

Kaviratne and Others v Commissioner General of Examination and

Others (supra) at p.150 observed that the objectives and the powers vested

with the Commission clearly indicate that the University Grants Commission

has the overall authority in selecting the students for relevant and different

courses of studies in the Higher Educational Institutions.

In this connection, this Court must consider, albeit briefly, the

contention of the Petitioners that once the 1st Respondent University

has forwarded the list of names of the students, who have passed the

test in the order of merit, the 18th Respondent Commission then selects

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

30

the mark obtained by the 250th applicant in the said list and sets the Z-score

received by the 250th applicant as the final cut off Z-score for the enrolment of

applicants to the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent for the respective

year. Clearly, this contention presupposes that the list of names of the

students of those who have passed the test had been prepared inclusive

of the marks each student had individually received and is arranged

and presented in the order of merit. However, in the 1st list of 360

names, which included the Petitioners names, or in the 2nd list that had

been sent to the 18th Respondent Commission by the 1st Respondent

University does not contain such detailed information.

The Petitioners have annexed the said 1st list to their Petition,

marked as P16(vi). It is similar in format to the 2nd list of 393 names,

marked as P16(vii). The 2AA Respondent too had annexed those two

lists annexed to his objections, marked as 2R4 and 2R4A respectively.

Thus, it is noted that in any of these lists, neither the individual

marks obtained by any of the 750 students nor the marks of each

student in the order of merit were made available to the 18th

Respondent Commission by the 1st Respondent University. This is a

factor in support of the position of the said Commission. The 1st

Respondent University describes the 393 students whose names appear

in the 2nd list (2R4A) also as students who have passed the aptitude

test in fulfilling the 750 names of students who have passed the

aptitude test requirement.

The 18th Respondent Commission, upon the receipt of the said 2nd

list of students, who are now confirmed by the 1st Respondent

University as students who also have passed the said test, had in turn

conveyed to the said University by letter dated 14.06.2019 (X6) that it

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

31

had decided to consider all the students in the lists sent by the said

University for admission, including the names of the 52 Petitioners.

The validity of contention of the Petitioners that the 1st

Respondent University forwarded the names of the students who have

scored 50 and above, in their order of merit, is negated when the two

lists of names that had been sent are perused. In the absence of details

as to the individual marks received by each student and without having

their names arranged in an order of merit, even if this was the

methodology adopted in making selections, it is impossible for the 18th

Respondent Commission to select the mark obtained by the 250th applicant

in the said list and sets the Z-score received by the by the 250th applicant as the

final cut off Z-score for the enrolment of applicants to the Faculty of Music of

the 1st Respondent for the respective year in the absence of such

information.

In this context, it is important to note that the insistence to have

three times the proposed intake of students who have passed the practical

/aptitude test by the 18th Respondent Commission commenced with the

selection of students for the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent

University from academic year 2018/2019. The 18th Respondent

Commission, as a result of a situation that had arisen in selecting

students for the course of study in Speech & Hearing Sciences at the

University of Kelaniya. The act of the University of Kelaniya, in setting

the pass mark of the aptitude test it conducted at 70, resulted in the

non-selection of students, who ought to have been selected on Z-score.

The 18th Respondent Commission had to make arrangements to admit

them at a later point of time, in excess of the number of vacancies.

Therefore, the said Commission had decided on 09.08.2018 to inform all

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

32

the universities who conduct aptitude tests, that after the test the university

must submit three times more names than the enrolled number (X1).

In this respect it is important to bear in mind that when the 18th

Respondent Commission issued the UGC Handbook and thereby set

out the selection criteria for the University selection process for the

academic year 2018/2019, the mode of the selection process had already

been formulated upon the national policies and communicated to the 1st

Respondent University, inclusive of the requirement of sending

three times the proposed intake of students who have passed the practical

/aptitude test.

It is thus clear, when the Petitioners were sitting for their

Advance Level Examination in August 2018 the 18th Respondent had

already instructed the 1st Respondent University of the requirement to

send three times the proposed intake of students who have passed the

practical /aptitude test. By then the Petitioners were yet to be informed

of their respective Z-scores by the Department of Examinations (a

necessary pre-qualification even to apply in seeking University

admission) and are yet to complete the basic requirement even to apply

for University admission.

The series of correspondence between the two State institutions,

namely the 18th Respondent Commission and the 1st Respondent

University, over the issue of sending insufficient number of the names

of students who passed the aptitude test, as reflected by

P16(i)/X2/2R4, P16(iii)/X4/2R5, P16(iv)/X5/2R6 and P16(v)/X6, also

indicative of the consistency of the application of the said admission

policy that had already been formulated by the 18th Respondent

Commission and published in the said UGC Handbook.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

33

The reason as to why the contents of these correspondents were

referred to in such detail in the preceding paragraph was that the

Petitioners had annexed those letters to their petition, marked P16(i) to

P16(v), as documents, which are supportive of their contention.

Therefore, its contents had to be examined carefully, in order to verify,

whether they contain some indication of any undertaking made by the

said 18th Respondent Commission for the Petitioners to entertain a

substantive legitimate expectation, even though they were not

addressed to the Petitioners. If there was such an undertaking or a

promise of benefit, then only the Petitioners could demand the said

Commission to act on that undertaking i.e. only the students who have

scored 50 and above at the aptitude test will be admitted to the Faculty

of Music of the 1st Respondent University.

In view of the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners as well as of the learned State Counsel, it is necessary to

consider the allegation that the 18th Respondent Commission had acted

in ultra vires in interfering with the affairs of the 1st Respondent

University.

Section 46(1) of the University Act states that the Senate shall be

the academic authority of the University while proviso to section

45(2)(xviii) defines the term " academic matter to mean any matter which

is subject to the control and general direction of the Senate. Describing

powers and functions conferred on a Senate of a University, section

46(5) and (6) lists out the specific areas that are placed under it. Section

46(6)(viii) states that a Senate could recommend to the Council

requirements for the admission of students to courses of study.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

34

This is relevant, in view of the contention advanced by the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the 1st Respondent University,

being a University established under the Universities Act, under

sections 29(a), 46 and 46(5) of the said Act, the Senate of that University

had the autonomy to make decisions relating to their academic

functions, to have by-laws relating to admittance of students, and also

in determining the selection criteria to admit students into the said

University. He submits therefore the setting up of a pass mark and the

stage at which it is decided to set up the pass mark are clearly within

the purview of the Senate.

Apparently, the basis for the allegation of the Petitioners that the

18th Respondent Commission had interfered with the affairs of the

Senate in excess of its powers could be found in the contents of the

letter of instructions the said Commission had issued to the University

on 23.05.2019, marked as P16(iii). In that letter, the 18th Respondent

Commission informed the 1st Respondent University of the reasons as

to why it insists on three times the proposed intake of students who

have passed the aptitude test and reminds that the University had not

sent the requested number of students who passed the aptitude test.

The allegation of interference is therefore clearly referable to the

insistence of sending 750 names of students who passed the aptitude test

by the 18th Respondent Commission.

The requirement of sending 750 names was first mentioned in the

letter P16(i) by which the 19th Respondent, the then Chairman, on behalf

of the 18th Respondent Commission had instructed the 2nd Respondent,

the then Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent University, to conduct an

aptitude test and send the names of students who have passed that test.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

35

In order to have a clear understanding of the nature of the

instructions, in the context in which it had been issued, the relevant

paragraph from the said letter is reproduced below in its entirety:

Moreover, please send me the lists of names of students

who have passed the practical/aptitude test on or

before 16th April 2019 indicating the Full Name, Index

Number of the A/L Examination, 2018 & the

National Identity Card Number, as a soft copy as well

as a hard copy. Importantly, make sure that you send

three times the proposed intake of students who have

passed the practical/aptitude tests from each of course of

study for the academic year 2018/2019. (emphasis

original)

The letter P6(i) is a letter addressed to all Universities.

As already referred earlier on in this judgment, it is this act of

non-compliance by the 2nd Respondent, in his failure to send three times

the proposed intake, prompted the 19th Respondent to insist on sending

of 750 names of students who passed the test by letter P6(iii) addressed

to the 2nd Respondent, by which the latter had provided an explanation

for the insistence of 750 names. It is stated that this requirement is to

satisfy the district quota allocated for the particular course of study from each

district. Moreover, there is a tendency that the students who passed the

practical/aptitude tests getting selected to some other courses of study of

Universities due to the Z-score obtained and the preferences indicated by them

in their application forms. Therefore, if an adequate number of students who

passed the practical/aptitude tests are not provided by the Universities, the

proposed intake of such courses of study may not be satisfied.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

36

The 2AA Respondent had tendered a document containing the

methodology which had been adopted in conducting the aptitude test

on the students inclusive of the Petitioners as 2R1. In that document it is

clearly stated that the methodology of conducting the aptitude test and

the applicable criteria, inclusive of the pre-determined pass mark of 50

are applicable from the year 2018.

Strangely, the then Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent

University has placed his signature to that document only on 14.02.2019

whereas the 18th Respondent Commission, almost a month before, had

issued instructions by P16(i)/X2/2R4 on 16.01.2019, insisting that the 1st

Respondent University to send three times the proposed intake of

students who have passed the practical /aptitude test. The said

requirement in P16(i) is descriptive enough to put the 1st Respondent

University on notice, in foreseeing the practical consequences of its

decision to apply the pass mark of 50 and classifying the students on

that pre-determined pass mark.

It appears that the 1st Respondent University had not taken any

note of the requirement of sending three times the proposed intake at

that point of time despite the insistence by the 18th Respondent

Commission in P16(i) of that requirement. The 1st Respondent

University nevertheless proceeded to classify the students who have

passed the aptitude test with the pass mark of 50, it had already set up.

The act of the 1st Respondent University in sending only 360

names of students in its 1st list upon a pre-determined pass mark is a

direct result of adopting a methodology it had set up on 14.02.2019

(2R1) and said to be made applicable retrospectively to the year 2018, in

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

37

relation to the aptitude test conducted for the academic year 2018/2019,

without giving effect to the set of instructions given by the 19th

Respondent by issuance of P16(i). Given the fact that the said

requirement, which had been formulated by the 18th Respondent to

prevent the recurrence of the practical difficulties it had to deal with

over the insufficient number of names sent by the University of

Kelaniya, in falling short of the required number of student intake, as

indicated by X1, a more responsible approach should have been

adopted by the 1st Respondent University.

In adopting a pre-determined pass mark had an inherent defect

attached to it. There existed the risk of occurring an eventuality of not

having sufficient numbers of students, who have scored 50 and above,

in order to fill in the required number of 750 names. The overall

performance of the students who took the aptitude test was not known

by then. If the University, with the full awareness of what is required of

that institution, had considered the said eventuality, then it could easily

have avoided proceeded along with that particular course of action, in

view of the unnecessary risk factor. There is no material in the

statement of objections or in the supportive documents to indicate that

the 1st Respondent University had in fact considered the practical

implications of its decision to set up a pre-determined pass mark,

inclusive of the situation that resulted in the filing of the instant

application.

If the University could have considered the several options before

proceeding on the course of action it had adopted, it could very well

have left the issue of fixing a pass mark shifted down to a point at

which an overall assessment of the performance of students could be

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

38

undertaken. It appears that, by setting up a pre-determined pass mark,

the 1st Respondent University had clearly painted itself into a corner.

Interestingly, it is noted that not only the 1st Respondent

University, but several other Universities too were troubled with the

identical practical problem, after applying a pre-determined pass mark.

Those institutions also, have adopted the same escape route, as the 1st

Respondent University did, in order to satisfy the requirement of

sending three times the proposed intake of names of students who have

passed the aptitude test by lowering the pass mark. This is indicative

from the correspondence the 18th Respondent Commission had with the

University of Sri Jayawardenepura and Swami Vipulananda Institute of

Aesthetic Studies of the Eastern University, that have been tendered

marked as Y2 and Y3.

In replying to the submissions of the Commission on the setting

up of a pre-determined pass mark, Learned State Counsel accused the

18th Respondent Commission for its alleged failure to give specific and

clear instructions in the manner of setting up of such a pass mark. In

view of the powers and functions that have been conferred on a

University by section 29 of the Universities Act, the reluctance of the

Commission to do so could be understood as, in its act of issuing

instructions to send the names of those who have passed the practical

/aptitude test, the Commission had clearly left the task of determining

the students who have passed, to the 1st Respondent University itself.

The manner in which it conducts the aptitude test and the criterion of

selection of students for the purpose of compilation of the pass list too

were therefore left to the discretion of the 1st Respondent University.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

39

Nowhere in any of these letters of instructions it did indicate that

the 19th Respondent had interfered with the affairs of the 1st

Respondent University by forcing them to lower the pass mark as

alleged by the Petitioners. The insufficient number of 360 students in

the 1st list was a direct consequence of the act the 1st Respondent

University in setting up of a pre-determined pass mark, simply by

following the guide lines it had set up for the previous years aptitude

test, and thereby not complying with the instructions that made it

imperative that the University to send 750 names of students who have

passed the aptitude test for the current academic year.

In order to comply with the instructions of the 18th Respondent

Commission of 750 names of students, who have passed the aptitude

test, subsequent to its insistence, the 1st Respondent University had on

its own decided to lower the pass mark to 26 from the previous 50. This

was due to the decision of the 1st Respondent University, upon

realisation of the practical impasse it had created, in setting up a pre-

determined pass mark even before it conducted the aptitude test. It is

only in order to reconcile with the requirement of 750 names, the 1st

Respondent University did revise the pass mark and lower it to 26 from

50.

By this subsequent revision of the pass mark, the 1st Respondent

University had shifted the point at which it had set up the pass mark

and thereby made its earlier pass mark of 50, changed into a provisional

pass mark. The decision to shift the point of fixing the pass mark, from

a point prior to the aptitude test further down to a point, after the

aptitude test is conducted and thereby enabling the University to

identify 750 names of students who passed the test, made a way out of

the difficult situation. That decision was taken by the University itself

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

40

and the said shift of the point of fixing the pass mark and its subsequent

revision were made clearly within its scope and powers.

In these circumstances, the pass mark of 50, as set up by the 1st

Respondent University, should clearly be considered only as a

provisional pass mark, as the said University had subsequently

reduced the pass mark to 26, on its own motion.

These factors effectively negates the Petitioners contention that

the 1st Respondent University was compelled to lower the pass mark by

the 18th Respondent Commission to accommodate the students who

have failed the aptitude test, since the 1st Respondent University, in

setting up its own notional pass mark, should have been mindful of the

requirement that had been insisted upon by the 18th Respondent

Commission in P16(i) that the University must forward a list three times

the proposed intake of students who have passed the practical /aptitude test.

Contrary to the allegation, these factors support a conclusion that

the 18th Respondent Commission only directed the 1st Respondent

University to conduct a practical/aptitude test and to send names of

students who have passed the test in three times of the proposed intake

and did not instruct them to determine a pass mark at any stage, let

alone instructing them to lower the pass mark to accommodate

students, who have initially failed the aptitude test, as the Petitioners

have alleged.

This certainly is a convenient point to turn to the contention of

the Petitioners that the selection for university admission should

primarily be based on the marks received by each student at the

aptitude test, shifting the Z-score to a secondary consideration. This

position is clearly indicated in the petition of the Petitioners that the 18th

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

41

Respondent Commission, having received the list of the students who

have passed the aptitude test, would thereupon selects the mark

obtained by the 250th applicant in the said list and sets the Z-score received by

the 250th applicant as the final cut off Z-score for the enrolment of applicants to

the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent for the respective year and

accordingly the 250 applicants selected to the Faculty of Music in the 1st

Respondent University, first and foremost pass the mandatory aptitude test

and then subsequently must satisfy the minimum Z-score set by the 18th

Respondent .

Learned Counsel for the 18th Respondent Commission submitted

that the aptitude test cannot be considered as the sole determinative

factor in proof of proficiency in respect of the relevant artistic field, as

the Advanced Level examination also has a inbuilt stringent practical

component that each candidate had to complete and therefore

regardless of how the Petitioners have fared at the aptitude test, all

students who have a Credit pass to their chosen field of study possesses

sufficient level of proficiency in that field to be able to productively

pursue a degree course.

In section 1 of the UGC Handbook, under the heading 1.1,

admissions policy for State Universities and Higher Educational

Institutes under the 18th Respondent Commission are spelt out. Section

2.1. refers to Titles of each course of study under different subject streams

Under the heading 1.2, with the title Minimum requirements for

University Admission, the UGC Handbook makes reference to the Z-

score as it states Selection of students for university admission for the

academic year 2018/2019 will be determined on the basis of rank order on

average Z-scores obtained by candidates at the G.C.E. (Advanced Level)

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

Examination held in year 2018, released by the Commissioner General of

Examinations.

The UGC Handbook, under the heading of admission policy,

stated For students seeking admission to Arts courses mentioned in 1 to 9 of

the section 2.1.(1) of this Hand Book All Island Merit is the main criterion

used for selection.

Section 2.1.(1) in turn states that admission to courses of study

mentioned in 1 to 9 above will be made on an All Island Merit basis

and the 1st Respondent University is identified as its 13th institution.

Courses of study 1 to 9 are described under the heading 2.2.2.1 and

Music, the course of study the Petitioners seek admission to, is listed as

item 8, i.e. Music, Dance, Drama and Theatre and Visual Arts in the

University of the Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo.

The said section specifically refers to students, who seek

admission to Arts courses in 1 to 9 of the section 2.1, which is inclusive

of the course of study in Music, of the selection criterion it had

stipulated. It states, All Island Merit is the main criterion used for

selection. However, section 1.1 also states that there is one exception to

All Island Merit selection criterion for selection of students to Arts

Courses inclusive of Music, under the heading 1.1.1, and adds that

selection for these courses is based on the district quota system. The manner

in which the district quota system operates too had been described in

that section, to which I shall refer in more descriptive terms, at a later

stage in this judgment.

Thus, the selection criterion for Music is clearly laid out as All

Island Merit basis and that in turn is based on the rank order on

average Z-scores obtained by candidates at the G.C.E. (Advanced Level)

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

43

Examination held in year 2018. As noted earlier on, in relation to

Music, only the failure of the aptitude test would disentitle a candidate

for admission to the 1st Respondent University.

It had been observed in De Alwis v Anura Edirisinghe and seven

Others (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 18 at p.24 that It is not disputed that since 2001 in

Sri Lanka, the University admissions were based on the Z-scores obtained by

the individual candidates at the Advanced Level Examination. This method

was introduced by the University Grants Commission in order to avoid any

unfairness in the process of selection. There was no contention before this

Court that the Z-score should be ignored in selection for university

admission.

It is already noted that the selection for the course of study of

Music, as stated in pages 8 and 9 of the UGC Handbook, is based on the

district quota system. It is also stated that up to 40% of the available

places are selected on the Z-score ranking of All Island Merit. Of the

remaining 60%, up to 55% are selected on the district quota system and

accordingly available places in each course of study will be allocated to

the 25 districts, in proportion to the total population of each district on

the ratio calculated by taking into consideration of the total population

of that particular district and the total population of the country. In

addition, 16 districts had been categorised as educationally

disadvantaged districts and the remaining 5% of the total available

places are given to students of these districts. Of that 5%, the number of

places allocated to each of the 16 districts would be decided, upon the

ratio of the population in a particular district to the total population of

the 16 districts. Having allocated the number of places for each of the

districts, the students are grouped on the basis of their district, after the

All Island Merit criterion is complied with, and thereupon are

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

44

arranged in their district ranking on the Z-score. The Z-score of the last

student in the order of merit, who fills the number places allocated to a

particular district last, is taken as the cut of mark for that particular

academic year for that district. Then only the selection process for

university admission is finalised by the 18th Respondent Commission,

leaving only the task of issuing a notification to the respective

Universities of the selected students.

At this juncture, it is prudent to consider the relative Z-scores of

the students who have been selected for admission to the said Faculty

by the 18th Respondent Commission, especially in view of the allegation

of the Petitioners that the 2nd list, sent by the 1st Respondent University,

did contain names of students who have failed the aptitude test and

therefore are disentitled to be selected for admission.

The 18th Respondent Commission had tendered a list it had

prepared in a table form, along with its limited objections (XII), based

upon the information contained in the two lists of names of students

sent by the 1st Respondent University; with separate columns under the

following headings - the index number, full name, the District

considered for admission, the individual Z-score, the cut off mark,

selection status along with the category and finally, remarks. Under the

said remarks column, the 18th Respondent Commission had described

the relative status of the Petitioners, stating whether each of them

would have been selected for admission under list 1 or list 2. Based

upon that classification, the 18th Respondent Commission averred that,

out of the 52 Petitioners, 24 of them could not be selected because of

their low Z-scores while the balance of 28 Petitioners could have been

selected on their Z-scores, if only the 1st list is considered. It is also

indicated, if the selections are made, out of the 336 names of the 1st list

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

45

containing the names of students who have passed the aptitude test by

obtaining 50 or more marks, only 96 students would qualify to be

admitted, thereby leaving wide gulf of 154 vacancies for admission to

1st Respondent University vacant.

The 18th Respondent Commission had determined the cut off

marks for each of the districts after selecting students from the 1st list

and the 2nd list. Since the Z-score being the primary consideration,

exclusion of students with low Z-score from the selection list is clearly

justified as it had been the declared and accepted selection policy

contained in the UGC Handbook.

In order to have a clear understanding of the relative Z-scores of

the students who had been selected from the districts from which the

Petitioners also have sat for their Advance Level Examination, the

highest and the lowest of Z-scores for that district along with the

relevant cut off marks, and the Z-scores of the 52 Petitioners are

arranged in tabulated form below, based on the information contained

in the document P1 tendered by the Petitioners as well as the document

marked X11 by the 18th Respondent Commission. In P1, the Petitioners

have indicated the districts in which they sat for the Advanced Level

Examination and the Z-score each of them has obtained.

It is already noted that the Petitioners have primarily relied on

the instructions contained in the UGC Handbook in support of their

claim of frustration of legitimate expectation. Therefore, it is important

to examine the applicable instructions and policy statements contained

in the said document, particularly in order to determine whether there

was an undertaking or a promise of such a benefit, based on aptitude

test marks, had been offered to the Petitioners by the 18th Respondent

Commission. It is for this reason, the Petitioners contentions were

considered against the policy statements contained in the UGC

Handbook, in the preceding paragraphs.

But before I proceed with that undertaking, it is prudent to

examine the applicable legal principles that defines the concept of

legitimate expectation beforehand, since it is the basis on which the

Petitioners have sought intervention of this Court to redress their

grievance.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

53

In De Smiths Judicial Review, 8th Ed, at p. 673, it is stated that It is

a basic principle of fairness that legitimate expectations ought not to be

thwarted. The protection of legitimate expectations is at the root of the

constitutional principle of the rule of law, which requires regularity,

predictability, and certainty in governments dealings with the public. The

first use of the phrase legitimate expectation, in the context of Public

law, is attributed to Lord Denning MR in the judgment of Schmidt v.

Secretary of State for Home Affairs [1969] 2 Ch. 149, and only in the

House of Lords decision in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister

for Civil Service [1985] A.C. 374 where it was identified by the Court of

the two situations in which a legitimate expectation would arise. It had

been stated by the House of Lords that legitimate expectation would

arise if a person is deprived of some benefit or advantage which either

he had been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can

legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until it is

communicated to him some rational ground for withdrawing it on

which he has been given an opportunity to comment or, he has received

assurance from the decision maker will not be withdrawn without first

giving him an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that

they should not be withdrawn.

De Smith (at p. 676) and Craig on Administrative Law 5th Ed (at

p.421) has described a third category on which legitimate expectation

could arise, as an extension from the second category referred to above.

De Smith describes it as Such an obligation to consult will arise if, without

any promise, a public authority has established a policy distinctly and

substantially affecting a specific person or group who in the circumstances was

in reason entitle to rely on its continuance and did so and identifies the

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

54

expectation of the continuance of the policy as a substantive

expectation.

What is understood as substantive legitimate expectation as

against procedural legitimate expectation was clarified by Weerasuriya J

in Sirimal & Others v. Board of Directors of the Co-operative

Wholesale Establishment & Others (2003) 2 Sri L.R. 23, at pg.28 with

the statement If the legitimate expectations are protected only procedurally,

the most employees could hope for, would be an order requiring consultation

before a change of policy is affected. If however, the legitimate expectations are

substantive the position is different, in that it is open to a Court to require the

public authority to confer upon the person the substantive benefit which he is

expected to receive under the earlier policy.

In a more recent pronouncement of Ariyarathne and Others v.

Illangakoon and Others (SC FR Application No. 444/2012 decided on

30.07.2019) Prasanna Jayawardena J had observed that the phrase

substantive legitimate expectation captures the situation in which the

applicant seeks a particular benefit or commodity, such as a welfare benefit or a

license, as a result of some promise, behaviour or representation made by the

public body. To elaborate the point further, his Lordship had cited

Professor Craig on Administrative Law, 7th Ed. at p.679, where the

learned author states that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation

is based on the principle of legal certainty which requires that a person

should be able to plan action on the basis of representations made to him by a

public authority and which he has reasonably relied on.

When viewed in the light of the above principles, it appears that

the Petitioners are in fact alleging frustration of their substantive

legitimate expectations as they seek a substantive relief, in the form of a

direction from this Court on the Respondents, in admitting the

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

55

Petitioners to the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent University. The

Petitioners prayer seeking the said relief is a clear indication that they

do not seek a procedural legitimate expectation, by which they could

only seek an opportunity of being heard, before a decision is taken.

Where an applicant relies on frustration of his legitimate

expectation, in seeking to challenge a decision made by a public

authority, the Court would have to satisfy itself as to the legitimacy of

that expectation. In R v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p

Coughlan [2000] 3 All E.R. 850, it was stated that in a situation where

frustration of substantive legitimate expectation is alleged, the Court

will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any

overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy. But it would

undertake that task once the legitimacy of the expectation is established.

In Kaviratne and Others v Commissioner General of Examination and

Others 2012 [B.L.R.] 139 at p.149, it was declared that whether an

expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact.

Therefore, it is necessary for this Court to satisfy itself that the

undertaking or promise of a benefit from which the 18th Respondent

Commission had resiled from, as alleged by the Petitioners in support

of their claim of frustration of legitimate expectation, is a clear,

unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification per Lord Justice Bingham

in R v. IRC Ex p. MFK Underwriting Agencies [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1545 at

1570. In examining whether such an undertaking is a clear,

unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification, the House of Lords, in

the case of Francis Paponette and Others v. The Attorney General of

Trinidad and Tobago [2010] UKPC 32, adopted the test used in R

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

56

(Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary

of State for Defence [2003] QB 1397at para 56: by stating how on a fair

reading of the promise it would have been reasonably understood by those to

whom it was made.

How, this objective test is applied is illustrated by the reasoning

adopted in the judgment of R v. North and East Devon Health

Authority, ex p Coughlan [2000] 3 All E.R. 850. This was an instance

where a woman with special needs was assured by the National Health

Service that she would receive nursing care for life at a purpose-built

facility by that service. At a later point of time, the National Health

Service had decided to transfer her care to a local authority, after

closing down that facility.

In determining the question whether the legitimacy of the

expectation is established, the Court considered the words used in a letter

issued by a General Manager of the predecessor to the local health

authority, which stated:

I am writing to confirm therefore, that the Health

Authority has made it clear to the Community Trust that

it expects the Trust to continue to provide good quality

care for you at Mardon House for as long as you choose to

live there. I hope that this will dispel any anxieties you

may have arising from the forthcoming change in

management arrangements, about which I wrote to you

recently."

When the National Health Service challenged her application on

the basis that there was no legitimate expectation since the letter did not

actually use the expression home for life, the Court, after accepting that

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

57

the words of the letter did create a legitimate expectation for care for life

in a dedicated facility, said: once the legitimacy of the expectation is

established, the Court will have the task of weighing the requirements of

fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the change in policy.

In relation to the consideration, whether there is frustration of

substantive legitimate expectation, the Court observed:

The Court has, in other words, to examine the relevant

circumstances and to decide for itself whether what

happened was fair. This is of a piece with the historic

jurisdiction of the Courts over issues of procedural

justice. But in relation to a legitimate expectation of a

substantive benefit (such as a promise of a home for life)

doubt has been cast upon whether the same standard of

review applies.

De Smith, (supra) states (at p.680) that the judgment of R v. North

and East Devon Health Authority, ex p. Coughlan (ibid) is where a

personally directed representation occurred in one of the earliest cases on the

substantive expectation (although those words were not used) and adds that

an example for the creation of a legitimate expectation would be where

an express undertaking is given which induces an expectation of a specific

benefit or advantage and the form of the express representation is

unimportant as long as it appears to be a considered assurance, undertaking or

promise of a benefit, advantage or course of action which the authority will

follow. Professor Craig describes this judgment as the leading decision

at that point of time on substantial legitimate expectation, in the 5th

edition of his book (at p.649).

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

58

The 18th Respondent Commission is the sole authority who

decides whether a student is selected for university admission or not.

That is a decision taken on the basis of the individual Z-score of the

student. The 1st Respondent University had no such authority to select

students for admission. The 1st Respondent University, in informing

each Petitioner of his or her result in relation to the aptitude test,

through letters P11(i) to P11(lii), thought it fit to remind them of the fact

that their selection to the University is dependent on the result of the

aptitude test as well as their Z-score. Hence, the fact that, in securing 50

or more marks in the aptitude test, the Petitioners have satisfied an

additional entry requirement for University admission, in turn offered

them of no undertaking or a promise of a benefit by the 18th Respondent

Commission.

Irrespective of the selection criterion for the admission to the

State Universities, whether they are selected under the All Island Merit

or the District Quota, the primary consideration adopted by the 18th

Respondent Commission is the rank order of the Z-scores obtained by the

candidate for that particular year in the Advance Level Examination.

The said Commission asserted that it had selected the students for the

Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent University on that basis and the

above table referring to the relative Z-scores supports that position. The

emphasis of Z-score in selection for admission by the 18th Respondent

Commission is clearly stated in the UGC Handbook. The achievement

of 50 or more marks at the aptitude test by the Petitioners, only

indicated that they are not disqualified for admission to the course of

study in music. If they were to be selected to the 1st Respondent

University, they had to have the required level of the Z-score, which is

set under the district basis scheme and also to pass the aptitude test.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

59

Thus, I am of the view that the contention of the Petitioners, that

once the 1st Respondent University conducts the aptitude test, it would

then constructs a list of the applicants who have passed the aptitude test, in

the order of the highest receiving mark, and refer the same to the 18th

Respondent as one of the important procedural requirements that had

to be followed in the selection process, is based on an erroneous

assumption made on the selection policy, as declared in the UGC

Handbook.

It is already noted elsewhere, that the manner in which the

Petitioners have perceived the selection process employed by the 18th

Respondent Commission for selection of students for University

admission is that the said Commission, having received the list of the

students who have passed the aptitude test from the 1st Respondent

University, then, selects the mark obtained by the 250th applicant in the said

list and sets the Z-score received by the 250th applicant as the final cut off Z-

score for the enrolment of applicants to the Faculty of Music of the 1st

Respondent for the respective year.

It is clearly evident from the above considerations that this is not

the procedure of selection as set out in the UGC Handbook issued by

the 18th Respondent Commission. Clearly the Petitioners have misled

themselves in adopting the said view in relation to the actual selection

process for admission to the Faculty of Music in the 1st Respondent

University. It is not a situation where the application of a simple

equation in which the names of the students who have scored 50 or

more are arranged in the order of merit and then the 18th Respondent

Commission picks the Z-score obtained by the 250th student as the cut

off mark for university admission.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

60

The perception of the Petitioners, in relation to the selection

process that accordingly the 250 applicants selected to the Faculty of Music

in the 1st Respondent University, first and foremost pass the mandatory

aptitude test and then subsequently must satisfy the minimum Z-score set by

the 18th Respondent could not be termed as a perception that had

been created upon fair reading of the statements contained in the UGC

Handbook.

The factual situation as well as the legal principles that had been

relied upon by the Petitioners are more or less akin to what had been

relied upon by the Petitioner in her application under Article 126, as

indicative from the judgment of this Court in De Alwis v Anura

Edirisinghe and Others (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 18.

In that application, the Petitioner, being a student who had been

initially selected for the medical faculty on her Z-score, as indicated in a

provisional list, was subsequently selected to the dental faculty. The

said provisional list was revised upon the release of re-correction results

of other candidates. The re-correction results had changed the overall Z-

score of students, which in turn resulted in receiving a lower Z-score by

the Petitioner than her previous Z-score. In these circumstances she

had, in support of her allegation of violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution, claimed frustration of substantive legitimate expectation,

alleging that she had a legitimate expectation that she could enter a Faculty

of Medicine without sitting for the Advanced Level Examination for a further

time. The Respondents had taken up the position that her selection to

Medical Faculty was made on the provisional Z-score and therefore is

not final. They also contended that there was no change in the

applicable policy and accordingly she could not have entertained

any legitimate expectation, based on the said provisional Z-score result.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

This Court, having relied on dicta of Lord Diplock in Council of

Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (The GCHQ Case)

- (1984) 3 All E.R. 935, that if a person relies on legitimate past practice that

had been withdrawn or changed suddenly without any notice or reason for

such withdrawal or change, determined that there was no promise or an

undertaking on the part of the Respondents, which established a past

conduct on which the student could have founded her claim on a

legitimate expectation.

It is held by the Court that :

the present application, as has been shown clearly,

there is no material to indicate that the past practice has

been changed or withdrawn at the time the petitioner had

sat for the Advanced Level Examination or at the time the

results were released. On the contrary the same system

which was used in the previous year had been followed

and the candidates were told that depending on the

results of the re-scrutiny of papers, the Z-scores could

change.

Similarly, in this instance too, there was no change in the declared

admission policy by the 18th Respondent Commission. The 1st

Respondent University partially complied with the directive of the 18th

Respondent Commission to send names of students who have passed

the aptitude test in three times the proposed intake. In fulfilling the said

requirement, the 1st Respondent University therefore revised its pre-

determined pass mark and made an additional list of another 393

names of students in its 2nd list, as students, who also have passed the

aptitude test.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

62

This fact does not validate the contention advanced by the

Petitioners that the students, whose names are contained in the 2nd list,

were selected to be admitted to the 1st Respondent University by the

18th Respondent Commission, in spite of the fact that they had failed in

the aptitude test. The said 1st list of names of 360 students could be

taken only as a provisional list, in view of the subsequent revision of the

pass mark by the 1st Respondent University in compiling the 2nd list.

Hence none of the students included in the 2nd list can be considered as

disqualified for admission, as they too have passed the aptitude test.

Learned Counsel for the 18th Respondent Commission contended

that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate to this Court that there

has been an established practice by the said Commission of giving

primacy to the results of the aptitude test over that of the Z-score

obtained by students and had relied on the following quotation from

the judgment of Ariyaratne et al v. Illangakoon et al (SC FR

Application No. 444/2012 SC minutes of 30.07.2019), in support:

the first characteristic which will sustain a

Petitioners claim that he has a substantive legitimate

expectation the respondent public authority will act in a

particular manner with regard to him, is that the

petitioner must establish the public authority gave him a

specific, unambiguous and unqualified assurance that it

will act in that manner [or, alternatively, that the

respondent 57 public authority has followed an

established and unambiguous practice which entitled the

petitioner to have a legitimate expectation the public

authority will continue to act in that manner or that the

facts and circumstances of the dealings between the public

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

63

authority and the petitioner have created such an

expectation.

As in the case of, De Alwis v Anura Edirisinghe and Others

(supra) in this instance too, the Petitioners have failed to establish that

there is an undertaking or a promise of a benefit contained in the UGC

Handbook or in any other notification addressed to them stating that

the selection for admission for the Faculty of Music of the 1st

Respondent University by the 18th Respondent Commission would be

made on the basis that the mark obtained by the 250th applicant in the

said list and sets the Z-score received by the 250th applicant as the final cut off

Z-score for the enrolment of applicants to the Faculty of Music of the 1st

Respondent for the respective year.

In applying the objective test of fair reading on the policies and

the applicable selection criterion as stated in the UGC Handbook, on

which the Petitioners have founded their contention before this Court, I

find that there never was an undertaking or a promise of a benefit given

to any of the Petitioners by the 18th Respondent Commission that in

selecting students for admission to the Faculty of Music of the 1st

Respondent University, it would only consider the students who have

scored 50 marks and above in the aptitude test. In the absence of any

undertaking or a promise of a benefit, the legitimacy of the expectation,

being an integral component of the Petitioners contention, remain an

unestablished factor.

On the other hand, the UGC Handbook (P2) indicates the

consistency of the position adopted by the 18th Respondent Commission

before this Court, in very clear terms to any Petitioner, who took the

trouble to read the 20th question and answer in the section titled

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

64

Frequently Asked Questions by the Students (at p. 215). It is appropriate

to quote the particular frequently asked question and its answer

relevant to this application in verbatim, to illustrate how the 18th

Respondent Commission had indicated its admission policy on this

aspect.

The question No. 20 reads as follows:

What, if I pass the practical/aptitude test but not

within the cut off for the same course of study?

To enter the course of study that requires a

practical/aptitude test, you must obtain required Z-

score in addition to passing the practical/aptitude

test. You will not be selected to a course of study

merely by passing the practical/aptitude test, if you

have not obtained sufficient Z-score.

This question and its answer under FAQ, provides an

unambiguous answer to the issue, whether there was any undertaking

or a promise of a benefit, that had emanated from the 18th Respondent

Commission, that students with 50 or more marks are only considered

for admission to the 1st Respondent University irrespective of their

individual Z-score, clearly in the negative. It is explicitly stated therein

that only the students, who obtained the required Z-score, in addition to

passing the aptitude test are selected. In applying the said objective test

of fair reading of the highlighted policies and instructions contained in

the UGC Handbook (P2) I am of the view that there never was such an

undertaking or a promise of a benefit given to any of the Petitioners by

the 18th Respondent Commission.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

65

It is indeed unfortunate that if the internal squabble between the

two State institutions that are invested with statutory powers and

functions relating to tertiary level education over the failure to send 750

names, had created a mistaken belief of a legitimate expectation in the

minds of the Petitioners for selection for admission to the 1st

Respondent University, to which they had no reasonable prospect of,

due to their relatively low Z-score values. This Court empathies with

the Petitioners and understands their frustration in failing to fulfil their

aspirations to pursue higher education in their chosen areas of study.

Not only the Petitioners have scored more than 50 marks at the aptitude

test; most of them have secured A passes for the subject of music in the

Advanced level examination, a clear indication of being gifted with a

natural talent in music. But the highly competitive and therefore

tightly-regulated University selection process designed to minimise

inequality, based on the national policies on University admission, and

gave them no undertaking or a promise of a benefit of making the

selections the way they have expected. Accordingly, the Petitioners are

not entitled to relief under the public law principle of substantive

legitimate expectation.

The imposition of an additional requirement of a pass in the

practical/aptitude test, in the selection for admission to the degree

programs in the Arts, apparently had a troubled history. The 1st

Respondent University strongly felt the result of such a test should be

the determinant factor for selection of students to the degree

programmes conducted by it. However, the 18th Respondent

Commission is not so convinced of the validity of an argument for

attributing an enhanced status to the results of the aptitude test in the

University selection process. Essentially, this is a policy issue best left to

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

66

be resolved by the concerned public entities, who possess the required

expertise to formulate a policy that addresses these concerns, in the

light of the Directive Principles of State Policy, as set out in the Article

27(2)(h) of the Constitution.

Before I part with this judgment, there is one more allegation of

the Petitioners that should be considered. In their act of citing the 28th,

29th and 30th Respondents, the Petitioners would have intended to

demonstrate to Court that at least in the selection of one of the said

three Respondents to the Faculty of Music of the 1st Respondent

University, the 18th Respondent Commission had acted contrary to its

own selection of policy of admitting students who fails the

practical/aptitude test he/she is deemed ineligible for admission for the relevant

course of study.

Despite making the claim that the 28th, 29th and 30th Respondents

have failed the aptitude test, the Petitioners did not substantiate that

assertion by making reference to them in the two lists sent by the 1st

Respondent University to the 18th Respondents, marked as 2R4A and

2R6A/XII. These two documents contain only the names of the students

who have passed the aptitude test along with their index numbers and

the NIC numbers, as confirmed by the 1st Respondent University. No

individual marks were mentioned in any of these two lists. It is only in

the list, marked as 2R3, details of the marks received by each student is

disclosed to Court but that too under the reference Exam No with no

mention of their names, index numbers or the NIC numbers. Hence,

whether the 28th and 29th Respondents have passed or failed in their

aptitude test were not established or could be ascertained.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

67

Name of the 30th Respondent is listed under No.4 in Colombo

district with a Z-score of 1.2032 and included as No.114 in the list of

selected students for admission (2R2A). It is clear from the above

tabulation that the 30th Respondent has a Z-score over and above the cut

off mark of 0.9382 for Colombo district. The Z-score of the 21st Petitioner,

who had the highest Z-Score of 0.8558, when compared with the other

Petitioners who sat for the Advance Level Examination from the

Colombo district, is obviously a lower Z-score than the said cut off mark.

The 30th Respondents name is included in the 2nd list containing names

of the students who have passed the aptitude test conducted by the 1st

Respondent University under No. 169 and therefore does not disqualify

herself for admission, since the applicable policy consideration clearly

stipulated that the failure of the aptitude test only made a particular

student ineligible for admission for the relevant course of study.

Considering all the facts and circumstances that had been placed

before this Court and for the reasons set out above, I have reached the

conclusion that the Petitioners have failed to establish the legitimacy of

their expectation in the selection of the students for admission to the

degree program of Bachelor of Performing Arts Music (Special)

conducted by the Faculty of Music in the 1st Respondent University, for

the academic year 2018/2019 by the 18th Respondent Commission.

Therefore, the said selection made by the 18th Respondent Commission

could not be termed as an illegal, unfair, arbitrary or an unreasonable

act, which had violated any of the 52 Petitioners fundamental right to

equality as guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, by

frustrating their substantial legitimate expectation.

S.C. (FR) No. 343/2019

68

Therefore, I hold that the Petitioners have not been successful in

establishing that their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution were infringed by one of more Respondents.

This application is accordingly dismissed. I make no order as to

costs.
