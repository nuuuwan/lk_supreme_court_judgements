Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The respondent wife instituted this action against the petitioner

husband in the District Court seeking a divorce, the custody of

their child and financial support. Summons was reportedly

served on the petitioner through the Ministry of Justice as he is

resident in the United States of America. The case was taken up

for ex parte trial and judgment entered for the respondent. The

decree nisi was reportedly served on the petitioner and the

decree absolute entered. The petitioner made an application

5

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code to vacate the ex

parte judgment on the basis that neither summons nor decree

nisi was served on him. After inquiry the District Court refused

the application of the petitioner. On appeal the High Court

affirmed it by judgment dated 25.11.2020. The petitioner filed

this leave to appeal application on 07.01.2021 against the

judgment of the High Court. By motion dated 07.01.2021, the

Attorney-at-Law for the petitioner suggested 08.03.2021,

29.03.2021 and 31.03.2021 to list the application for support

for leave and further moved court to issue notice on the

respondent.

However in the said motion the Attorney-at-Law for the

petitioner stated as follows:

I tender herewith the original petition, affidavit (scanned

copy) and document annexed thereto marked B and the

signed proxy (scanned copy) in proof of my appointment as

registered Attorney-at-Law for the petitioner-petitioner-

appellant-petitioner abovenamed and 5 copies of the above

together with notices and stamped envelops and

respectfully move that the same be accepted and filed of

record.

I respectfully move that Your Lordships Court be pleased to

grant permission to tender the original affidavit, proxy,

documents marked A and B to be filed of record as soon as

it is practicable to do so.

In this motion the Attorney-at-Law for the petitioner admits the

petitioner did not tender:

(a) the original proxy

6

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

(b) the original affidavit in support of the petition

(c) the document purportedly marked A, which is the

appeal brief, and

(d) a certified copy of the document marked B, which is

the judgment appealed from.

Having admitted that the application is incomplete, can the

petitioner sensibly move court to fix the matter for support for

leave to appeal? How can the petitioner support for leave

without the appeal brief when he seeks leave to appeal on the

basis that he was not served with summons and decree nisi,

which is a mixed question of fact and law if not a pure question

of fact. There cannot be any dispute that the appeal brief

purportedly marked A in the petition is a material document to

support this application.

Rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 inter alia states:

Every application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme

Court shall be made by a petition in that behalf lodged at

the Registry together with affidavits and documents in

support thereof as prescribed by Rule 6, and a certified

copy or uncertified copy of the judgment or order in respect

of which leave to appeal is sought.

What are the affidavits and documents prescribed by Rule 6?

Where any such application contains allegations of fact

which cannot be verified by reference to the judgment or

order of the Court of Appeal in respect of which special

leave to appeal is sought, the petitioner shall annex in

support of such allegations an affidavit or other relevant

7

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

document (including any relevant portion of the record of

the Court of Appeal or of the original court or tribunal).

There was no valid affidavit nor a copy of the District Court or

High Court case record when the petitioner lodged the

application for leave to appeal at the Registry of the Supreme

Court.

Rule 8(1) states:

Upon an application for special leave to appeal being lodged

in the Registry of the Supreme Court, the Registrar shall

forthwith give notice by registered post of such application

to each of the respondents in the manner hereinafter set

out. There shall be attached to the notice a copy of the

petition, a copy of the judgment against which the

application for special leave to appeal is preferred and

copies of affidavits and annexures filed therewith.

It is not a bare notice that shall be served on the respondent but

notice with a copy of the petition, and affidavits and annexures

filed therewith.

The proper service of notice on the respondent through the

Registrar of the Supreme Court is the duty of the petitioner.

Once notice is issued by the Registrar, the duty is cast upon the

petitioner by Rule 8(5) to attend at the Registry to verify whether

notice has been returned undelivered and if so to take further

steps to serve notice on the respondent.

As the original proxy, affidavit and annexures were undertaken

to be produced as soon as it was practicable to do so, and since

without those documents there was no point in issuing bare

8

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

notice on the respondent and fixing the application for support,

the Judge made order in chambers on 05.02.2021 directing the

petitioner to tender all marked documents and the

memorandum and thereafter move for support.

Although the judgment of the High Court was delivered on

25.11.2020, the application for leave to appeal was filed on

07.01.2021, and this court on 05.02.2021 made order to tender

all marked documents and then move to support for leave, the

petitioner did not tender (a) the original proxy, (b) the original

affidavit, (c) appeal brief purportedly marked A, (d) a certified

copy the High Court judgment marked B and (e) complete notice

to be served on the respondent. The matter was left in abeyance.

It is against this background that the respondent filed a motion

dated 28.07.2021 with notice to the petitioner seeking to dismiss

the petitioner’s application for leave to appeal in limine on the

basis that the petitioner who is resident in the United States of

America is intentionally refusing to take steps to prosecute the

leave to appeal application in order to delay the finality of the

matrimonial action.

This motion was supported in open court by learned President’s

Counsel for the respondent and learned President’s Counsel for

the petitioner made reply submissions.

According to paragraph 34 of the petition, the reason for the

inability to file documents with the petition was the COVID-19

pandemic, imposition of quarantine curfew and lockdown in the

Keselwatta police area.

Rule 2 permits the petitioner to tender documents later, but he

must show his bona fides and satisfy the court that he exercised

9

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

due diligence to secure the documents and any failure was

beyond his control.

If the court is satisfied that the petitioner had exercised due

diligence in attempting to obtain such affidavit, document,

judgment or order, and that the failure to tender the same

was due to circumstances beyond his control, but not

otherwise, he shall be deemed to have complied with the

provisions of this Rule.

Was there quarantine curfew and lockdown from 25.11.2020

(the date of the High Court judgment) until 07.01.2021 (the date

the petition was filed) preventing the petitioner from obtaining a

certified copy of the appeal brief? Is there any proof that the

petitioner at least applied for a certified copy of the appeal brief?

Has the petitioner explained why he could not tender the

original proxy and the original affidavit along with the petition?

The answers are in the negative.

Let us assume the COVID-19 pandemic, imposition of

quarantine curfew and lockdown in the Keselwatta police area

prevented the petitioner from obtaining marked documents at

the time of filing the application. Was there due diligence on the

part of the petitioner to obtain those documents after the filing

of this application on 07.01.2021?

When this motion was supported seeking dismissal of the

petitioner’s application nearly seven months after the filing of

the application for leave to appeal, the petitioner had still not

tendered the original proxy, original affidavit, memorandum and

marked documents which he undertook to produce as soon as

possible. The High Court and this court were not closed for

10

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

seven months. There was no quarantine curfew or lockdown for

seven months. This is not the only leave to appeal application

filed during this period. The contumacious conduct of the

petitioner is conspicuous.

This court has in an array of decisions1 repeatedly emphasised

the importance of due compliance with the Supreme Court Rules

and the consequences of non-compliance. Non-compliance with

the Supreme Court Rules results in dismissal of the application

in limine without going into the merits.

I acknowledge that cases should not be thrown away on

technicalities without going into the merits unless they go to the

root of the matter. Such an attitude will erode the confidence

placed in the justice system by those who come to court seeking

redress. But this is not a mere technicality.

I am also sensitive to the fact that the Rules setting out

procedure have been made to facilitate the due administration of

justice and not to thwart it. For the effective and efficient

administration of justice, both substantive law and procedural

law must co-exist. Substantive law aims at the ends which the

administration of justice seeks to achieve while procedural law

aims at the means by which those ends can be achieved.

Without procedural law in place, substantive law will be illusory.

No acceptable reason has been adduced by the petitioner to

satisfy the court that he exercised due diligence in attempting to

SC/HCCA/LA/36/2021

obtain marked documents and tender the original proxy, original

affidavit and memorandum for nearly seven months. As I stated

earlier, even at the time of the respondent supporting the motion

for dismissal of the petitioner’s application, there was no

complete leave to appeal application before court.

The losing party shall not be allowed to abuse the process of

court to prevent the winning party from enjoying the fruits of his

or her victory.

In my view, the petitioner failed to exercise due diligence in

prosecuting this application for leave to appeal and failed to

comply with Rule 2 read with Rule 6, and Rule 8(1) read with

Rule 8(3) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990. I dismiss the

application in limine.
