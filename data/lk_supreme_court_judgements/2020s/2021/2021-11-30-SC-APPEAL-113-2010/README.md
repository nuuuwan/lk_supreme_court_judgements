JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC J.,

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) filed

action against the 1st to 4th Defendants in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya for the

partition of a land called Ihalawatte which is in extent of about 2 Acres. The 5th

Defendant was added as a party, subsequently.

By judgement dated 13th May 2003, the Learned District Judge dismissed the Plaint

on the ground that the Plaintiff had failed to prove both his pedigree and his title

to the land sought to be partitioned.

Aggrieved by the said judgement, the Plaintiff appealed to the Civil Appellate High

Court of the North Western Province, which affirmed the judgement of the learned

District Judge and dismissed the appeal.

Against the said judgement, the Plaintiff moved this court by way of Leave to

Appeal and Leave was granted on the questions of law referred to in sub-

paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of paragraph 18 of the Petition of the Appellant

(Plaintiff).

The questions of law in verbatim, are as follows;

a) Has the District Court and the High Court erred in failing to hold that

the chain of title relied on by the Plaintiff Appellant Petitioner had been

proved in terms of deed P1, mortgage bond 4D1 and crown grant 4D4,

in preference to the chain of title relied on by the 4th Defendant because

the lands described in his deeds 4D2, 4D3, 4D5 clearly did not apply to

the land sought to be partitioned.

b) Did the District Court and the High Court err in holding that the Plaintiff

Appellant Petitioner had failed to prove title to the land sought to be

partitioned in this action.

5

c) Did the District Court and the High Court errs in holding that the

Plaintiff Appellant Petitioner had failed to prove the devolution of title to

the corpus.

The Corpus

The Plaintiff, instituted this action against the 1st to 4th Defendants seeking the

partition of a land called Ihalawatte more fully described in the schedule to the

Plaint. The Plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to an undivided share of

Ihalawatte, and that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants were entitled to 1/6 shares

each.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants did not have any contest with the Plaintiff. The 4th

Defendant, however, claimed title to the entire land based on title deeds and the

5th Defendant took up the position that the corpus was co-owned by him and the

4th Defendant in equal shares and prayed for the dismissal of the action.

In the Petition dated 21st December 2009, the land is described as a single land

consisting of an old plantation and new plantation, which is in the extent of

about 2 acres.

The land sought to be partitioned was surveyed by the Court Commissioner S.B.

Abeykoon who submitted a preliminary plan bearing No. 626/85 along with a

preliminary report to the Court. According to the said Court Commissioner, the

land sought to be partitioned was shown to him by the Plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and

4th Defendants. The Court Commissioner while giving evidence had stated that the

preliminary plan depicts the land described in the schedule to the Plaint. He also

had stated that it was a parcel of land. Further, he had added that no one produced

any previous survey plans relating to the land and that he relied on the boundaries

shown to him by the parties present on the land, for the purpose of carrying out

the survey.

The Contention of the Plaintiff

The main argument on behalf of the Plaintiff was that the conclusion arrived at by

the learned District Judge, as well as by the Judges of the High Court of Civil

Appeal, to the effect that the Plaintiff failed to prove the devolution of title to the

corpus, is erroneous.

The key point raised by the Plaintiff is that the Deed marked P1, mortgage bond

marked 4D1 and crown grant marked 4D4 which the Plaintiff relied on, apply

to the corpus for partition and show the devolution of title which is described in

the Plaint. He argues that this is in stark contrast to the deeds produced by the 4th

Defendant, marked 4D2, 4D3 and 4D5 which the Plaintiff claims have no

application to the land sought to be partitioned.

The Questions of Law

I wish to consider the second and third questions of law [b & c], namely, whether

the lower courts have misdirected themselves by holding that the Plaintiff has

failed to establish, his title to the corpus [b] and the devolution of title to the corpus

[c].

According to the pedigree relied on by the Plaintiff [annexed to the Plaint], in the

year 1910, H.M. Davith Singho and H.M. Bandappu, had received a crown grant

in equal shares to the land depicted in the survey plan No. 273672 which is in

extent 3 Roods and 28 perches. After Bandappus demise, Herath Singho, being the

sole heir, had inherited the share of the land owned by Bandappu. In the year

1984, Herath Singho by Deed No. 7260 [P1] sold his share to the Plaintiff,

Solomon. According to the Plaintiffs pedigree, the Crown grant is 3 Roods and 28

perches in extent. The schedule to the Deed No. 7260, however, refers to, two

allotments viz;

(1) land depicted in plan No. 273672, in extent of 3 roods and 28 perches

and

(2) 1/3rd of another land, 1 and acre in extent, with distinct boundaries.

7

The Plaintiff has not produced a separate pedigree in relation to, either the 1st or

the 2nd allotments of lands referred to above. Nor has he explained the basis of

amalgamating the entitlement to an undivided land to another distinct separate

land. The schedule to the Plaint, as stated earlier, refers only to a single parcel of

land and nowhere in the Plaint is it said that the corpus is an amalgamated land.

The Plaintiff, however, in the pedigree filed on his behalf, had made reference to a

crown grant of 3 roods and 8 perches and possession for a long period of time and

inheritance, vaguely giving the impression that the corpus contains in extent, more

than what was given by the Crown grant. In his evidence, however, he has taken

up the position that two parcels of land are involved. The Plaintiff had failed to

explain as to how an undivided share in the second schedule of the Deed P1,

became part of the amalgamated land. Thus, the Plaintiff had presented a case

that is materially different to what was pleaded, which is obnoxious to the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code [Section 150 explanation 2]. The Plaintiff

had admitted that what he purchased was the land that was received by Herath

Singho by way of a crown grant [page 126 of the District Court record].

The Plaintiff in an attempt to impress that the corpus consists of two amalgamated

lands in extent of two acres, had executed a deed of mortgage, on March 1985,

two months prior to filing the partition action in the District Court [Deed no. 346

marked and produced as 4V1]. Under cross examination, the Plaintiff admitted

that he mortgaged the property as he was in need of money, to one Pausthina, as

claimed by the Plaintiff, one of his neighbours. He also admitted that even by the

date on which he testified he had not taken any steps to have the mortgage

discharged. Probed further, the Plaintiff admitted that Pausthina is none other than

his wife [ pages 135 -137 of the District Court record].

Considering the above, both the learned District Judge as well as the High Court of

Civil Appeal was correct in holding that the Plaintiff had failed to establish, both,

the title to the land sought to be partitioned as well as the devolution of title to the

same.

In the circumstances, I answer both the questions of law referred to in paragraphs

(b) and (c) above in the negative. In view of these findings, I am of the view that it

8

would not be necessary to consider the question of law referred to in paragraph

(a) above as the case for the Plaintiff is bound to fail.

Accordingly, the judgments of both the District Court as well as the High Court of

Civil Appeal are affirmed and this appeal is dismissed subject to costs of Rs.

150,000/=.
