Counsel: Mr. Suren Fernando with Sajith Dias for the Applicant-Respondent-Appellant Mr. D. V. R. Isuru Lakpura, for the Respondent-Appellant-Respondent

Argued on: 15.02.2021 Judgment on: 09.07.2021

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as The Appellant) has preferred an

application before the Labour Tribunal of Galle on 07th February 2013 for alleged unlawful termination

of his employment by the Respondent-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as The

3 Respondent) and sought an order for reinstatement with backwages, reasonable compensation and

for all statutory entitlements for the loss of his employment as a Boatman in the Seenigama Devol Maha

Devalaya.

At the conclusion of the trial before the Labour Tribunal, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

had come to a conclusion that the termination of the Appellants service by the Respondent was in fact

unjust. Further, considering the working history, nature of work and the income of the Appellant as a

boatman, the learned President ordered the Respondent to pay Rs 2,100,000/= being the 7 years

salary, instead of making an order for reinstatement.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent made an appeal to the Provincial High Court of Galle.

By the judgment dated 31st May 2019, the learned High Court Judge partly allowed the Appeal and

reduced the quantum of compensation to one year salary, i.e., Rs. 300 000/= considering the age of the

Respondent and his future prospects as a boatman.

The Appellant preferred the instant application to this Court seeking to set aside the judgment of the

High Court and to affirm the Order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal. This court

considering the submission by both parties, granted special leave on questions of law identified in sub

paragraphs (d) and (e) of the Paragraph 11 of the Petition dated 10th July 2019, which are as follows;

(d) Did his Lordship of the High Court err in law in failing to recognize that the Order of the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal was lawful, just and equitable?

(e) Did his Lordship of the High Court err in law in altering the quantum of compensation

awarded?

4 When answering the 1st question referred to above, it is important to consider whether the order that

was challenged before the High Court, which was delivered by the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal was lawful, just and equitable.

When the Respondent appealed against the order of the Labour Tribunal to the High Court, the High

Court made order to reduce the quantum of compensation, but did not interfere with the findings of

the Labour Tribunal with regard to its decision that,

a) There was a Master-Servant relationship existed between the Applicant and the Respondent

b) The services of the Applicant was illegally terminated by the Respondent

c) The Labour Tribunal had decided to pay compensation instead of making an order for

reinstatement

Even though the Appellant preferred the instant appeal before this court against the decision of the

High Court to reduce the quantum of compensation without interfering with the rest of the order, the

Respondent was satisfied with the said finding and did not appeal against the said order.

In the said circumstances it is not necessary for this Court to consider whether the order of the Labour

Tribunal is lawful, just and equitable with regard to its finding on the above three issues which is not

challenged in the instant application.

The only remaining issue that has to be looked by this Court is, whether the order made by the Labour

Tribunal to pay Rs. 2100000.00 being seven years salary instead of making an order of reinstatement,

was lawful, just and equitable.

Based on the finding that was reached by the Labour Tribunal, that the services of the appellant who

had worked as a boatman at Seenigama Devol Maha Devalaya had unjustly terminated, the Labour

5 Tribunal had decided to grant compensation in lieu of reinstatement, since by then the appellant was

reaching the age of 65 years. In the absence of a specific service agreement between the two parties,

deciding the age of retirement and the other service benefits, the only document the Labour tribunal

relied was the letter of appointment which was produced marked as A-9. However, A-9 is silent on its

effect on continued long service and consequences of terminating the continued long service. In those

circumstances the Labour Tribunal whilst concluding the last drawn salary as Rs. 25000.00 based on the

evidence placed before the tribunal, computed the compensation on a mechanical basis to make it

seven years salary, but had failed to give any reason as to how the seven-year period was calculated.

In the absence of an accepted legal regime in calculating compensation in lieu of reinstatement, the

method that should be followed by the Labour Tribunal had been identified in a series of appellate

decisions.

In the case of Jayasuriya Vs. State Plantation Corporation (1995) II Sri L.R.379 at page 381

Amarasinghe J had identified the more logical method of computing the compensation as,

In determining compensation what is expected is that after a weighing together of the

evidence and probabilities in the case, the Tribunal must form an opinion of the nature and

extent of the loss, arriving in the end at an amount that a sensible person would not regard as

mean or extravagant but would rather consider to be just and equitable in all the circumstances

of the case..

. The essential question is the actual financial loss caused by the unfair dismissal

because compensation is an indemnity for the loss. What should be considered is financial loss

and not sentimental harm

6

In the case of The Ceylon Transport Board Vs. Wijerathne 77 NLR 48 Vythialingam J had gone into this

issue in more detail and observed that,

In making an order for the payment of compensation to a workman in lieu of an order for

reinstatement under Section 33 (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, a Labour Tribunal should take

into account such circumstances as the nature of the employers business and his capacity to

pay, employees age, the nature of his employment, length of service, seniority, present salary,

future prospects, opportunities for obtaining similar alternative employment, his past conduct,

the circumstances and the manner of the dismissal including the nature of the charge levelled

against the workman, the extent to which the employees action were blame-worthy and the

effect of the dismissal on future pension rights. Account should also be taken of any sums paid

or actually earned or which should also have been earned since the dismissal took place

When granting compensation to the Appellant the Labour Tribunal was mindful of the decision in

The Ceylon Transport Board Vs. Wijerathne (supra) and had referred to the guidelines identified in

the said judgment as follows;

However, when calculating the compensation, whether the Labour Tribunal was in fact followed the

said guidelines supported by the evidence led before the tribunal and made a just and equitable order

is a matter that has to be considered at this stage. When considering the above I am further mindful of

the following observation made by Amarasinghe J in the case of Jayasuriya Vs. Sri Lanka State

Plantation Corporation. (supra)

The Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 Section 31D states that the order of a Labour Tribunal

shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court except on a question of law. While

appellate courts will not intervene with pure findings of fact, they will review the findings

treating them as a question of law, if it appears that the Tribunal has made a finding wholly

unsupported by evidence, or which is inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it; or

where the Tribunal has failed to consider material and relevant evidence; or where it has failed

to decide a material question or misconstrued the question at issue and had directed its

attention to the wrong matters; or where there was an erroneous misconception amounting to

a misdirection; or where it failed to consider material documents or misconstrued them or

8

where the Tribunal has failed to consider the version of one party or his evidence; or erroneously

supposed there was no evidence.

It is also observed in the case of Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation Vs. Lanka Podu Seva

Sangamaya (1990) I Sri LR 84 that;

An appeal lies against an order of a Labour Tribunal on a Question of Law. Thus, the Appeal

Court may intervene if the Tribunal appears to have made a finding for which there is no

evidence - a finding which is both inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it.

As revealed before the Labour Tribunal, the Appellant was 64 years old and was working as the chief

boatman at the time his services were terminated in August 2012. Even though the Appellant had

claimed that he was fit enough to work as a boatman even at the age of 64, no evidence was placed

before the tribunal with regard to his future prospects and/or opportunities for obtaining alternative

employment. It is also evident that, in the absence of any agreed retiring age, the Respondent had

allowed the Appellant to work until he reached the age of 64 years. However, the Labour Tribunal had

failed to give its mind to this aspect of the case. In the absence of an agreed retiring age between the

parties, the Labour Tribunal should be more responsible to take into consideration the reasonable age

when computing compensation.

S. R. de Silva had considered the question of retiring age in the absence of a written agreement as

follows;

. While there is no law relating to the age of retirement, the general practice has been to

retire such employees at 55. There are, however, exceptions. In the plantation industries (tea

and rubber) the age of retirement of manual workers has been prescribed as 60 for males and

55 for females.

9

Where the age of retirement is not covered by the contract of employment or a collective

agreement; it is not unusual to find cases involving the justification of retirement being the

subject matter of application to Labour tribunal. It could fairly and safely be assumed that

retirement at the age of 60 would not be regarded as unreasonable by a Labour tribunal, even

if retirement at that age was not contracted for.

[The Legal Framework of Industrial Relations in Ceylon by S.R De Silva at page 586]

In the case of Elpitiya Plantations Ltd Vs. Ceylon Estates Staff Union and others (2004) 1 SLR 239, it

was held that the optional age of retirement with the employer was 55 years, subject to the annual

extensions until 60 years which is the compulsory age of retirement and the extensions of services may

be given is a discretion on the part of the employer. Therefore, it was further held that the termination

of the workmans service at 55 years was not just or inequitable.

In the case of M/S. British Paints (India) Ltd Vs, Workmen 1966 AIR 732, it was held that,

Considering that there has been a general improvement in the standard of health in this

country and also considering that longevity has increased, fixation of age of retirement at 60

years -appears to us to be quite reasonable in the present circumstances. Age of retirement at

55 years was fixed in the last century in government service and had become the pattern for

fixing the age of retirement everywhere. But time in our opinion has now come considering the

improvement in the standard of health and increase in longevity in this country during the last

fifty years that the age of retirement should be fixed at a higher level, and we consider that

generally speaking in the present circumstances fixing the age of retirement at 60 years would

be fair and proper, unless there are special circumstances justifying fixation of a lower age of

retirement.

10 In the case of Guest, Keen, Williams Private Ltd Vs P. J. Sterling and Others 1959 AIR 1279 it was

observed that,

In fixing the age of superannuation industrial tribunals have to take into account several

relevant factors. What is the nature of the work assigned to the employees in the course of their

employment? What, is the nature of the wage structure paid to them? What are the retirement

benefits and other amenities available to them? What is the character of the climate where the

employees work and what is the age of superannuation fixed in comparable industries in the

same region? What is generally the practice prevailing in the industry in the past in the matter

of retiring its employees? These and other relevant facts have to be weighed by the tribunal in

every case when it is called upon to fix an age of superannuation in an industrial dispute.

However, as revealed before the Labour Tribunal, at the time of the Appellants services were

terminated, he has already passed the retirement age but admittedly he was engaged in a very

responsible job.

Even though he has more experience and fitness to work as claimed by him, this does not mean that he

should continue with his job until he feels unfit, in the absence of an agreed retiring age between the

employer the employee. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal should have mindful of this

aspect when computing compensation

Therefore, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal should have considered the financial loss

caused to the Appellant as well as the retirement age or current age of the Appellant when computing

the compensation, because it is erroneous to assess the compensation based on the uncertain loss and

indefinite period for retirement.

11 When considering the above it is observed that there is no reasonable basis in computing compensation

based on 7 years wages as the Appellant was terminated at the age of 64 and thus, he does not have

any future losses on the termination of the employment. Therefore, this court is of in the view that the

Appellant cannot be reinstated because of his current age and on the other hand, awarding

compensation as Rs 2,100,000 being 7 years salary is erroneous and excessive.

When awarding 7 years salary as compensation, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal had also

considered the fact that the Appellant was not paid EPF and gratuity by the employer but, payment of

statutory dues cannot be considered in granting compensation since there is a statutory remedy

available for non-payment of such dues.

When the Respondent appealed against the findings of the Labour Tribunal to the High Court, the High

Court Judge while reducing the amount of compensation ordered by the Labour Tribunal had stated

that;

Yet, considering the age of the Respondent (now the Appellant) and his future prospects as a

workman, the compensation awarded by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal should

be declared to be excessive.

As such, having considered the age and the future prospects of the workman based on the

nature of the work engaged by him, I hereby vary the amount of compensation to the sum of

Rupees Three Hundred Thousand which is equivalent to one year salary of the Respondent

However, the learned High Court Judge in reducing the amount of compensation ordered by the learned

President had not provided sufficient grounds as to why he reduced the 7 years salary of the Appellant

into 1 year. On the other hand, for a just and equitable Order, it is not sufficient to say that considering

the age of the Respondent and his future prospects to reduce the amount ordered by the learned

12 President without analyzing the material with regard to the computation of the compensation ordered

by the learned President is erroneous or excessive.

Even though it is declared that the learned High Court Judge had failed to give reasons in reducing the

compensation ordered by the Labour Tribunal, when considering the matters that has been already

discussed in this judgement, payment of one years salary as compensation to an employee whose

services had been unlawfully terminated appears to be just and equitable.

I therefore answer both questions of law raised before this court in negative and dismiss the instant

appeal without cost.

This Appeal is Dismissed. No cost.
