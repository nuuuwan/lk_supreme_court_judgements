ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st Petitioner, a registered trade union (rcfha ;lafiarelrejkaf.a

ix.uh& and five of its members (2nd to 6th Petitioners) have, by their

petition dated 2nd September 2021 supported by an affidavit of the 3rd

Respondent, invoked the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article

126 of the Constitution, alleging that a series of wrongful, illegal,

unlawful and arbitrary administrative/executive actions of the 1st

Respondent, the Government Chief Valuer P.P.D.S. Muthukumarana,

culminated in the publication of a paper advertisement on 17th July 2021

(P46A and B), which meant to favour certain others to score higher

marks on seniority whilst having a negative impact on them, are

violative of their fundamental rights as guaranteed under Articles

12(1),14(1)(a),(b),(c),(d) and (g) of the Constitution.

It is averred that the 2nd to 6th Petitioners have been recruited to

the Department of Valuation as Grade II of Class III Assistant District

Valuers and some of them were promoted as Grade I of Class II

Assistant Valuers. It is alleged by the Petitioners that when the 1st

Respondent sought to amend the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka

Valuation Service arbitrarily in 2017, the 1st Petitioner trade union had

launched a trade union action opposing the said move in November

2017, which continued for three months. During this period, the

membership of the 1st Petitioner Union had refrained from submitting

their progress reports as a trade union action but continued to perform

other duties that were allocated to them from time to time. The trade

union action was duly informed by letters dated 20th November 2017

and the 1st Respondent was informed of further escalation of trade

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

6

union action through a series of letters, in view of the fact that no

resolution of the dispute was provided by her.

On 5th February 2018, the dispute was amicably resolved after

negotiations with the Hon. Minister of Finance, who agreed that

resorting to the aforesaid trade union action will not have any effect on

their career prospects. However, it is alleged that the 1st Respondent

had directed the Regional Valuers of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces to

temporarily suspend the salary increments for a period of six months in

relation to certain officers, an act indicative of mala fide on the part of the

said Respondent. This suspension was made on the basis that those

officers have failed to submit their progress reports for the Month of

November 2017. This was strongly objected to by the 1st Petitioner

Union by its letter dated 17th August 2018 and the Secretary to the

Ministry of Finance was kept informed of this development on 21st

January 2019.

The 1st Respondent had inquired from the 3rd Petitioner on 20th

August 2019 as to why he had failed to submit his progress reports for

the months of November and December 2017 and January 2018. The 3rd

Petitioner conveyed that the failure was due to trade union action.

The current Service Minute of the Sri Lanka Valuation Service

was published by the Public Service Commission in Gazette

Extraordinary bearing No. 2142/75 of 27th September 2019 (P18A),

substituting the previous Service Minutes. After the publication of the

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

7

current Service Minute, Field/Office based officers were absorbed to

the relevant grade under Clause 14 thereof and therefore members of

the 1st Petitioner Union who were from the batch of 2005 and 2008 and

had a service period of well over 10 years were absorbed to Grade I of

Class II while others who did not have 10 years were absorbed to Grade

II of Class II. The Petitioners claim that there was no notification

indicating the membership of the 1st Petitioner Union that their

seniority had been suspended/affected by a period of 6 months for

resorting to trade union action. The Petitioners further claim that a loss

of seniority of 6 months would affect them gravely inasmuch as it

would determine the Class they would fall into, namely Grade II of

Class II or Grade I of Class II.

At a meeting convened by the 2nd Respondent (Hon. Minister of

Economic Policies and Plan Implementation) on 24th February 2020, and

held between the concerned officials and the members of the 1st

Petitioner Union, a decision was taken to resolve the issue, in relation to

the members who have taken part of the trade union action and had

their salary increments suspended, in a manner that will not affect their

career progression.

On 4th December 2020, officers of the 2010 batch who completed

10 years of service received letters from the 1st Respondent informing

them of being promoted to Grade I of Class II, but only after omitting a

period of 6 months from the service period for engaging in trade union

action, and thereby preventing their promotion to Grade I of Class II.

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

8

Most of the membership of the 1st Petitioner Union have lodged appeals

to the Public Service Commission against the said arbitrary act.

It is averred that on 3rd March 2021, the Public Service

Commission had informed the 3rd Petitioner that his salary increment

had been suspended for legitimate reasons and could be excluded when

computing the period of satisfactory service, whilst conceding that it

had not considered whether the said suspensions made by the 1st

Respondent is in compliance with the due procedure (P25). The Public

Service Commission, upon an enquiry made by the 3rd Respondent into

the identical issue, repeated its view. The 2nd to 6th Petitioners had

therefore preferred their appeals against the said decision by the Public

Service Commission to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The 1st Respondent, by her letter dated 13th November 2020, had

initiated the process of calling for applications for the recruitment for

the executive officer post of Valuer in Grade III of Class I of the Sri

Lanka Valuation Service on the basis of Service Experience and Merit

(P44A to E). The notice of calling applications was published on 16th

November 2020. In response, the members of the 1st Petitioner Union,

inclusive of 3rd, 4th and 6th Petitioners have applied seeking

appointment to the said post.

Whilst the said Petitioners and others were awaiting their

interviews, the Public Service Commission published yet another notice

in the print media on 17th July 2021, making reference to the said notice

of 16th November 2020, causing an amendment to the allocation of

marks given for seniority as set out in the table published therein. It is

this amendment the Petitioners resist as they claim it favours a certain

group of applicants to score higher marks on seniority whilst having a

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

9

negative impact on others including the members of the 1st Petitioner

Union.

The Petitioners have thereby primarily sought to challenge the

proposed interview process and also the legality of the suspension of

their increments by the 1st Respondent for engaging in trade union

activity and loss of seniority of 6 months. They claim the said

suspension of increments had been made by the 1st Respondent,

contrary to specific direction of the Hon. Minister and to the provisions

of Public Administration Circulars, and thereby frustrating their

legitimate expectations. They claim these illegal actions coupled with

the amendment introduced to the Service Minute to facilitate the

ulterior motives of the 1st Respondent are violative of their fundamental

rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

The 1st to 4th and 14th Respondents resisted the Petitioners

application and, in view of the nature of the interim reliefs sought, the

Respondents have tendered limited objections setting out the factual

basis of their version.

When the instant petition was supported by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners on 8th December 2021, learned

Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st to 4th Respondents

raised preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the same and

sought its dismissal in limine. Parties were heard extensively on the

preliminary objections and afforded a further opportunity to

substantiate their respective position by tendering applicable judicial

precedents, in addition to the ones already referred to in their respective

submissions.

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

10

During her submissions, the Learned Additional Solicitor General

had articulated three grounds on which she wished to raise her

objections as to the maintainability of the instant application. It was

firstly contended that the latest of the series of decisions, namely the

publication of the notice calling for applications to Grade III of Class I

of Sri Lanka Valuation Service was published on 17th July 2021, whereas

the petition challenging its validity had been tendered only on 2nd

September 2021, well beyond the mandatory one month rule, as laid

down in Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

In addition to the said preliminary objection, the learned

Additional Solicitor General also contended that the 1st Petitioner, being

a trade union, had no locus standi to institute proceedings under Article

126, and that the Petitioners have failed to name the necessary parties to

their application, who would be adversely affected, if this Court grants

relief.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners sought to counter

the first of the three objections on the basis that the Petitioners have

alleged continuous violation of their fundamental rights and also have

sought intervention of the Human Rights Commission seeking redress

to their grievance and therefore, in terms of Section 13 of the Human

Rights Commission Act No. 21 of 1996, the petition of the Petitioners

could still be entertained by this Court. She invited attention of this

Court to the averments contained in paragraph 96 of the petition where

the 2nd to 6th Petitioners have specifically pleaded that they have

preferred individual complaints to the Human Rights Commission on

15th August 2021 and relied on the dicta of Murdu N.B. Fernando J in the

judgment of this Court in Ranasinghe Arachchige Nadeesha Seuwandi

Ranasinghe and another v Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

11

Limited ( SC FR No. 244/2017 S.C. Minutes of 22.02.2019), that in

view of the provisions of Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act,

time would not run during the pendency of proceedings before the Human

Rights Commission and such time will not be taken into account in computing

the period of one month within which an application may be made to this Court

in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

Since the first of the three preliminary objections refers to the

invocation of jurisdiction of this Court, I shall consider the same at the

very outset.

Relevant Sections of the Article 126(2) of the Constitution states

that any person, who alleges that a fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by

executive and administrative action, either he or his Attorney at Law,

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of Court as

may be in force, apply to the Supreme Court. It is clear from the

wordings of the said sub-Article that in order to ascertain the all-

important one-month period, the date of the alleged infringement must

be taken as the starting point.

The first reported instance of determining the nature and the

applicability of the limitation of one month as imposed by Article 126(2)

perhaps arose before this Court in Ranatunga v Jayawardena and

Others (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 124, where Samarakoon CJ, in upholding the

objection raised by the learned Solicitor General on behalf of the

Respondents, stated thus;

no action under Article 126 could have been

embarked on prior to 7th September 1978. However,

assuming that this was a threatened infringement and it

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

12

continued till the 7th of September 1978 it was up on to

the petitioner to make this application after the 7th

September 1978. But then the time limit of one month for

institution of this application becomes applicable, and the

application should therefore have been made within one

month after 7th September 1978. The application has in

fact been filed on the 4th June 1979, which is long after the

prescribed period. Counsel for the petitioner sought to get

over this provision by stating that words "within one

month thereof" in Article 126(2) refers only to an

infringement and not to the threatened infringement

referred to in that section. I am unable to agree with this

contention. The word "thereof" refers to the executive or

administrative action complained of and for the purpose

of this application must depend on what the petitioner

alleges in this petition as the wrongful action.

Since the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution on 7th September

1979, with the above quoted pronouncement by Samarakoon CJ, for over

a period of four decades, this Court had consistently held that the one-

month period from the alleged infringement, as imposed by the Article

126(2), is a mandatory requirement.

In the instant application, the Petitioners allege that a series of

acts and decisions attributed to the 1st Respondent and the Public

Service Commission, which culminated with the publication of the

notice of amended marking scheme applicable to the candidates to fill

63 vacancies of Grade III of Class I of the Sri Lanka Valuation Service, as

per the order of the Public Service Commission, on 17th July 2021 (P46B)

had infringed their fundamental rights. Learned Presidents Counsel for

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

13

the Petitioners termed the instant application is in relation to an

instance of a continued violation of their fundamental rights.

In this regard, the dicta of Marsoof J in the judgment of Lake

House Employees Union v Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (SC

FR Appln. No. 637/2009 S.C. Minutes of 17.12.2014) is relevant. His

Lordship states any complaint based on a continuing violation of

fundamental rights may be entertained by this Court if the party invokes the

jurisdiction of this Court within the mandatory period of one month from the

last act in the series of acts complained of .

It is evident from the factual narration in the preceding

paragraphs that the last of the series of acts that allegedly violate their

fundamental rights is the said publication of the notice (P 46B) on 17th

July 2021. Parties agree that no date had been notified for the interviews

of the applicants who responded to the said notice. The Petitioners have

had sufficient notice of the said publication since they have lodged

complaints to the Human Rights Commission against it. However, the

Petitioners have filed the instant application at the Registry of this

Court only on the 2nd September 2021. Therefore, the Petitioners

invoked the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court conferred under Articles

17 and 126, way past the said mandatory period of one month,

reckoned from the date of the last of the series of such acts attributed to

the 1st Respondent and the Public Service Commission, which allegedly

had infringed their fundamental rights.

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

14

In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider the contention

advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the

Petitioners that in view of the fact that they have tendered applications

seeking redress to the alleged violation of fundamental rights to the

Human Rights Commission, and with the operation of the statutory

provisions of section 13 of Human Rights Commission Act, whether the

preliminary objection that the application is time barred, should be

rejected.

Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act No. 21 of 1996 reads

as follows;

Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in

terms of Section 14 of the Commission, within one month

of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement of a

fundamental right by executive or administrative action,

the period within which the inquiry into such complaint

is pending before the Commission, shall not be taken into

account in computing the period of one month within

which an application may be made to the Supreme Court

by such person in terms of Article 126(2) of the

Constitution.

This Court on several instances had the occasion to consider the

effect of the said statutory provisions in relation to an application that

had been tendered to Court after the mandatory one-month period.

His Lordship S.N. Silva CJ, in the judgment of Subasinghe v The

Inspector General of Police and Others (SC Spl. No.16 of 1999 S.C.

Minutes of 11.09.2000) where the Petitioner had relied on section 13 of

the Human Rights Commission Act to bring his application within the

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

15

time limit imposed by Article 126(2), had rejected that contention on the

basis that the petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence that there has

been an inquiry pending before the Human Rights Commission.

In a situation where the petitioner had produced the receipt

issued by the Human Rights Commission confirming the lodgement of

an application for violation of human rights, Amaratunga J, in

Ranaweera and Others v Sub Inspector Vinisias and Others ( SC FR

Appln. No. 654/2003 S.C. Minutes of 13.05.2008) held that the

Human Rights Commission is not legally obliged to hold an investigation into

every complaint received by it regarding the alleged violation of a fundamental

right. Therefore, a party seeking to utilise section 13(1) of the Human Rights

Commission Act is obliged to place material before this Court to show that

an inquiry into his complaint is pending before the Human Rights

Commission.

The Petitioners have placed heavy reliance of the already quoted

dicta of Fernando J in Ranasinghe Arachchige Nadeesha Seuwandi

Ranasinghe and another v Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals

Limited (supra). But the circumstances that related to the Petitioners

application on applicability of Section 13 are clearly distinguishable

from one important factor as referred to in the said judgment. It is

stated clearly therein (at p. 15 of the judgment) that the petitioners in

that application had declared in the petition that a complaint was

made to the Human Rights Commission and that the said complaint was

acknowledged by the Human Rights Commission. In the instant

application, what the Petitioners have averred in paragraph 96 of their

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

16

petition is the Petitioners state that the 1st Petitioner on behalf of its

Members and the 2nd to 6th Petitioners have individually preferred complaints

to the Human Rights Commission on the 15th August 2021 concerning matters

complained hereof.

The instant application was filed on 2nd September 2021 and was

taken up for support to consider granting of leave to proceed on 8th

December 2021. During the said interval of three months the Petitioners

could have at least tendered any communication addressed to them by

that Commission that their applications were accepted and are pending

investigations. But they did not. Thus, the Petitioners have failed to

place material before this Court to show that an inquiry into his complaint is

pending before the Human Rights Commission per Ranaweera and Others

v Sub Inspector Vinisias and Others (supra). In this context, it is

relevant to note that this Court had frowned on the practice of those

petitioners, who seek to circumvent the limitation imposed by Article

126(2) by resorting to statutory provisions of Section 13(1) of the

Human Rights Commission Act. In the judgment of Kithsiri v Faizer

Musthapha and Others (SC FR Appln No. 362/2017 S.C. Minutes of

10.01.2018) Aluwihare J held that in the absence of any material to show

that an inquiry into the petitioners complaint is pending before the

Commission and in view of the petitioners desire not to have his

complaint investigated into by the Commission, the preliminary

objection raised on time bar is entitled to succeed.

It must also be noted that, despite the mandatory requirement

consistently imposed on a petitioner in invoking the jurisdiction under

Article 126 within the stipulated period of one month since the alleged

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

17

infringement, this Court had however retained its discretion to

entertain applications which allege violation of fundamental rights but

are filed beyond the said period of one month, if certain conditions are

fulfilled.

In Gamaethige v Siriwardana (1988) 1 Sri L.R. 384, Mark

Fernando J had held (at p.402) that in exceptional cases, on the

application of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse,

fault or, delay on the part of the petitioner, this Court has a discretion to

entertain an application made out of time. His lordship had decided so

upon a position that had arisen for consideration in the case of

Edirisuriya v Navaratnam and Others (1985) 1 Sri L.R. 100. The

petitioner in that matter had been arrested and detained under a

detention order without allowing access to his family or to any lawyer.

When access was permitted subsequently his visitors were advised not

to discuss about the case. He complained of violation of his fundamental

rights guaranteed under Articles 13(1), (2), 12(1) and (2) of the

Constitution. The Respondents have taken up the position that the

application of the petitioner is time barred, as he had taken more than

a month since his arrest to come before Court.

At the hearing, it was conceded by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General, who represented the respondents, that if the petitioner had,

after he was taken into custody by the Police, been held incommunicado, then

the period he was so held without having the opportunity of communicating

with his relations and or lawyers and of taking any meaningful steps to invoke

the jurisdiction of this Court should not and would not be counted in

computing the period of one month referred to in sub-article (2) of Article 126

of the Constitution and that the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia would, in

such a situation, apply.

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

18

In view of the constraints placed on the said petitioner, Fernando J

had stated in Gamaethige v Siriwardana ( at p.401) the time limit of one

month prescribed by Article 126(2) has thus been consistently treated as

mandatory; where however by the very act complained of as being an

infringement of a petitioner's fundamental right, or by an independent act of

the respondents concerned, he is denied such facilities and freedom (including

access to legal advice) as would be necessary to involve the jurisdiction of this

court, this Court has discretion, possibly even a duty, to entertain an

application made within one month after the petitioner ceased to be subject to

such restraint.

In order to exempt from the one-month time limit, it is for the

Petitioners to satisfy this Court of the existence of unavoidable

circumstances that had prevented them from invoking the jurisdiction

of this Court. It was also stated in Gamaethige v Siriwardana (supra)

(at p. 401) that it is a heavy burden on a petitioner who seeks that

indulgence.

The Petitioners have apparently not relied on this exception, as

they have not averred any circumstances that the resultant delay is no

lapse, fault or, delay on the part of the petitioner.

In view of the considerations referred to above, I am of the view

that the preliminary objection on the time bar raised by the learned

Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the 1st to 4th and 14th

Respondents is entitled to succeed. The petition of the Petitioners is

clearly time barred. Therefore, the necessity to consider the two

remaining preliminary objections does not arise.

S.C. Application No. SC/FRA269/2021

19

Accordingly, the petition of the Petitioners is dismissed in limine

as it had been filed beyond the mandatory one-month period as

imposed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

I make no order as to costs.
