ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 27.01.2021.

SISIRA J.DE ABREW, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. The Applicant-

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-Appellant) filed an

application dated 08.09.2008 in the Labour Tribunal alleging that his

termination of services was wrong. In the same application he sought re-

employment and back wages. Learned President of the Labour Tribunal by his

order dated 16.03.2012 dismissed the application of the Applicant-Appellant on

the basis that he had vacated his employment. Being aggrieved by the said

order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal the Applicant-Appellant

filed an appeal in the High Court of Colombo. The learned High Court Judge

by his judgment dated 17.11.2014 dismissed the Appeal and affirm the order of

the learned President of the Labour Tribunal. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the learned High Court Judge the Applicant-Appellant has filed an

appeal in this Court. This Court by its order dated 23.07.2015 granted Leave

to Appeal on questions of law set out in paragraph 10(a), (b), (c) and (e) of the

Petition of Appeal dated 15.12.2014 which are set out below;

SC.Appeal No.61/2015

3

1. Did the Hon. Judge of the High Court err in law by affirming the award

made by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal without properly

evaluating the evidence led in the Labour Tribunal?.

2. Was the said Order of the Hon. Judge of the High Court just and

equitable?

3. Was the said Order of the Hon. Judge of the High Court against the

weight of the evidence led and therefore contrary to the law?

4. Did the Hon. Judge of the High Court misdirect herself on whom the

burden of proof lies to establish the two aspects involving the concept of

vacation of post i.e. the physical absence from the work place and

intention of desert and abandon the employment?

The facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows;

The Applicant –Appellant was sent on vacation of post on two grounds;

1. Not reporting for duty

2. Not submitting the medical certificates.

According to the evidence led at the trial, the Applicant-Appellant could not

report for duty due to various harassment that he had to encounter in the

office. By letter dated 21.05.2008 marked “A25”, the Employer-Respondent-

Respondent ( hereinafter referred to as the Employer-Respondent) gave time to

the Applicant-Appellant to submit the relevant medical certificate till

30.05.2008. This letter dated 21.05.2008 has been signed by the General

Manager of the Employer-Respondent. Although, the Employer-Respondent by

letter dated 21.05.2008 marked “A25” (in the Labour Tribunal) gave permission

to the Applicant-Appellant to submit his Medical Certificate till 30.05.2008, the

Board of Directors of the Employer-Respondent on 21.05.2008 took a decision

to send the Applicant-Appellant on vacation of post. This evidence is revealed

at page 368 of the brief. The decision of the Board of Directors had been

SC.Appeal No.61/2015

submitted to the Labour Tribunal as “X1”. It is noted that by letter dated

21.05.2008 the Employer-Respondent gave permission to the Applicant-

Appellant to submit their medical certificate till 30.05.2008. But strangely on

21.05.2008 the Board of Directors has taken a decision to send him on

vacation of post. Therefore, the decision of the Employer-Respondent to send

him on vacation of post on 21.05.2008 itself is questionable.

The Applicant-Appellant has stated in his evidence that he could not report for

duty due to various harassments caused to him by the Chairman of the

Employer-Respondent. He has stated, in his evidence, that after the new

Chairman assumed duties in the Employer-Respondent company, the new

Chairman has taken a decision to demolish the office of the Applicant-

Appellant. It is interesting to note the incident that had taken place on

17.03.2008. The Chairman of the Employer-Respondent, on 17.03.2008, had

walked into the office of the Applicant-Appellant and threatened to kill him like

a dog by putting a pistol into his mouth. The Applicant-Appellant complained

this incident to the Police. The Applicant-Appellant was examined by a Doctor

and the Medico Legal Report has been produced as “A36a” in the Labour

Tribunal. The history given by the patient is as follows;

Alleged to have been assaulted by …… on 17.03.2008 at 12.30 p.m;

Slapped either side of the face;

Threatened by putting a pistol into mouth;

Attempted manual strangulation;

The Doctor, in the Medico Legal Report, has made the following observation;

“ History given by the victim is consistent with Medico Legal Examination

findings”

On the complaint made by the Applicant-Appellant on the above incident, the

Police filed a case against the Chairman of the Employer-Respondent. We note

that he was charged under Section 314 and Section 486 of the Penal Code. In

the Magistrate’s Court a settlement was reached and in the settlement, the

Chairman of the Employer-Respondent in Open Court apologized to the

Applicant-Appellant. Therefore, it is clear that the Chairman of the Employer-

Respondent has apologized to the Applicant-Appellant about what happened on

17.03.2008. When we consider the above evidence, the most important matter

that must be considered is whether the Applicant could have continued to

report for duty. When we consider the above material, we hold that there was

no opportunity for the Applicant-Appellant to report for duty at the office of the

Employer-Respondent.

After considering all the above matters, we hold the view that the Applicant-

Appellant did not have an intention not to report for duty and he was prevented

from reporting for duty by the Employer-Respondent. If the Applicant-

Appellant did not have an intention not to report for duty and was prevented

from reporting for duty due to the harassment caused to him by the Employer,

his employment cannot be terminated on the basis that he had vacated the

employment. This view is supported by the judicial decision in the case of

Nelson de Silva Vs. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation(1996) 2 SLR 342

wherein His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya made the following observation.

“A temporary absence from a place does not mean that the place is

abandoned; there must be shown also an intention not to return”

We have earlier pointed out that the Appellant did not have an intention not to

report for duty. According to the evidence led at the trial he could not report

for duty due to the harassment caused to him by the Employer-

Respondent at the work place. If he did not have an intention not to report for

duty, we hold that his services cannot be terminated on the basis that

he had vacated the employment. We have earlier said, that the decision

SC.Appeal No.61/2015

of the Employer-Respondent to send him on vacation of post is questionable.

For the purpose of clarity, we would like to state that Applicant-Appellant was

given time to submit medical certificates till 30.05.2008, but the Board of

Directors of the Employer-Respondent took a decision on 21.05.2008 to send

him on vacation of post.

Considering all these matters, we hold that the decision of the Employer-

Respondent to send the Applicant-Appellant on vacation of post cannot be

permitted to stand in law.

Considering all the above material, we held that the learned President of the

Labour Tribunal was wrong when he came to the above decision. In view of the

conclusion reached above, we answer the 1st question of law in the affirmative.

With regard to the 2nd question of law, we answer as follows;

“ The order of the Hon. Judge of the High Court is not just and

equitable”.

We answer the 3rd question of law in the affirmative.

With regard to the 4th question of law, we answer as follows;

The Applicant-Appellant did not have any intention of abandoning the

employment.

Considering all these matters we set aside the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge dated 07.11.2014 and the order of the Labour Tribunal dated

16.03.2012. We direct the Employer-Respondent to re-employ the Applicant-

Appellant in the same post that he held at the time of the time of termination

of services at the Employer-Respondent company and to grant him all back

wages and emoluments.

We direct the Respondent to implement this judgment within three months

from the date of this judgment.
