The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff-

respondent) instituted a partition action in the District Court of Gampaha. The corpus as

described in the schedule of the plaint is 24.61 perches in extent. The said land is depicted as lot

4 in plan no. P/3263 dated 13 May 1980 (the final partition plan in the aforesaid District Court of

Gampaha Case P/17889), which is a divided portion of a land called Higgaha watte. Two

defendants are cited in the plaint and the plaintiff-respondent claimed that he along with the two

defendants are the lawful co-owners of the corpus. The entitlement of each one of them is set

out in paragraph 6 of the plaint. He claims that he is entitled to 480/1392 shares and the 1st and

2nd defendants are entitled to 288/1392 and 624/1392 shares of the said land, respectively.

However, the two defendants disputed the claim of the plaintiff-respondent. They claimed that

the plaintiff-respondent has no entitlement to any shares of the said property and the two

defendants are the only lawful co-owners.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

There is no dispute on the identity of the corpus. All parties agreed that the corpus in question

was a part of the corpus in a prior partition action (P/17889). According to the final decree of the

said partition action dated 04 May 1981, three persons namely Leelawathie, Rosana alias Seeta

Fernando and Kusumawathie derived 480/1392, 288/1392 and 624/1392 shares of the said land

respectively. Rosana alias Seeta Fernando is the 1st Defendant in the partition action initiated by

the plaintiff-respondent. Said Kusumawathie had transferred all here rights and shares to one

Siridasa in 1983 (subsequent to the initial partition action) and said Siridasa transferred all rights

and shares derived from Kusumawathie to the 2nd Defendant.

The main contention in this case is as to who derives the shares allocated to aforesaid

Leelawathie, from the final decree in the initial partition case No P/17889.

The final decree of the partition case under consideration was issued on the 04th of May 1981.

The plaintiff-respondent claims that he derived the co-ownership to this property through the

Deed No 451 dated 02.11.1981. Aforesaid Leelawathie [one of the three co-owners on whom

the shares were devolved by the final decree in the aforementioned initial partition action

(P/17889)] conveyed 10 perches (480/1392 shares) that she derived from the partition case to

the plaintiff-respondent through the aforesaid Deed No 451 dated 02.11.1981. This deed was

produced marked P3 at the trial. It is on this basis that the plaintiff-respondent sets out the

devolution of the title. Respective shares of the three persons, whom he named as co-owners of

the said property has been calculated on this basis.

However, the two defendants disputed the devolution of the title set out by the plaintiff-

respondent. They claimed that Leelawathie did not have a right to convey the shares devolved

from the final decree in partition action P/17889, to the plaintiff-respondent in 1981. It is their

contention that said Leelawathie, had conveyed the lot or lots that would be allocated to her at

the final determination of the partition action 17889/P, to one of the other two co-owners namely

Kusumawathie by the deed no 3936 attested in 1976, while the said partition action was in

SC APPEAL 154/2016

progress. (The aforesaid deed 3936 was marked 1V2 by the defendants through the cross-

examination of the plaintiff-respondent subject to proof but did not lead further evidence to

prove the execution of the said deed).

Thereafter said Kusumawathie on 3rd November 1983 transferred all shares she derived from the

Final Decree in Case No. 17889/P of District Court of Gampaha and all shares said Leelawathie

derived from the said Final Decree (which were already transferred to her on 28 October 1976 by

aforesaid deed No. 3936 by said Leelawathie) to one R.D. Siriyadasa by deed No 5346 attested

by Valentine Dias N.P. (The aforesaid deed 5346 was produced marked 2V1). Thereafter, said

R.D.Siriyadasa transferred all his rights derived from said Leelawathie to L.H.Winston

Suraweera (the 2nd Defendant in the partition action relevant to this matter) on 20th January 1984

by the deed No 5454 attested by M.P.Padmini Pathirathna N.P. (The aforesaid deed 5454 was

produced marked 2V2). Therefore, defendents claim that the 2nd Defendant had derived all rights

and shares of said Kusumawathie (including shares of Leelawathie, which were transferred to

Kusumawathie by deed 3936 that was produced marked 1V2, subject to proof) and the plaintiff-

respondent could not derive any rights through the transfer effected by Leelawathie by deed 451

dated 02 November 1981.

The trial in the District Court proceeded on thirteen points of contest. One of the points of

contest raised by the plaintiff-respondent was:

No. 2 Whether rights to the land should be devolved on the parties in accordance with the plaint?

Three of the points of contest raised by the two defendants include:

No. 5 Whether Leelawathie had transferred her rights to Kusumawathie by the Deed No 3936

dated 28.10.1976

SC APPEAL 154/2016

5

No. 6 Whether the Plaintiff has any title or possessory Rights to the property in question

No. 7 Whether all rights of the land should be devolved in the two defendants as in accordance

with the scheme of devolution set out by the two defendants.

The plaintiff-respondent raised two additional points of contest namely:

No. 12 Whether the deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the statement of claim of the

two Defendants is a fraudulent deed (js;a;slrejkaf.a ysuslus m%ldYfha ioyka wxl 3936 iy

19761028 osk orK je,kaghska vhia fkd;drsia ;ek iy;sl l< Tmamqj jxpksl f,i ilia

lrk ,o Tmamqjla o?)

No. 13 Whether the deed No 451 dated 02.11.1981 had gained priority by being properly

registered under the provisions of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

In this matter, three different stages of the proceedings namely raising points of contest, the order

allowing the deed 3936 marked 1V2 be produced subject to proof and the delivery of the

judgement, did take place before three different judges. It was not the same learned judge before

whom the points of contest were raised, who delivered the judgement. The Learned District

Judge who delivered the judgment dated 03.09.2009 held in favour of the two defendants. He

answered points of contest Nos. 5 and 7 affirmatively and answered point of contest No. 6, has

no right. Furthermore, he held that points of contest Nos. 12 and 13, do not arise. The learned

trial judge accepted the scheme of partition of the two defendants and entered a judgment in

favour of the two defendants.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

6

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned district judge, the plaintiff-respondent

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and held in favour of the plaintiff-respondent.

The learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court ordered that the corpus be partitioned in

accordance with the devolution of title and shares set out by the plaintiff-respondent.

The main ground on which the Learned High Court Judges set aside the Judgment of the District

Court is that the Learned Judges decision to consider deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 as

evidence, is contrary to section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code and hence, was a

misdirection of law. They further held that point of contest No. 12 namely - Whether the deed No

3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the statement of claim of the two Defendants is a fraudulent

deed (js;a;slrejkaf.a ysuslus m%ldYfha ioyka wxl 3936 iy 19761028 osk orK

je,kaghska vhia fkd;drsia ;ek iy;sl l< Tmamqj jxpksl f,i ilia lrk ,o Tmamqjla

o?) - should have been answered affirmatively.

The two Defendants-Respondents-Petitioners-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

defendant-appellants) being aggrieved with the decision of the Civil Appellate High Court are

challenging the above decision of the Civil Appellate High Court, before this Court. This Court

had granted special leave to appeal on the following three questions of law raised by the

defendant-appellants:

1). Did their Lordships at the Civil Appellate High Court err in law in deciding that deed no 3936

(1V2) is a fraudulent document for the mere reason that the same has been marked subject to

proof?

SC APPEAL 154/2016

7

2). Did their Lordships at the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by wrongly applying the

principles laid down in the case of Hilda Jayasinghe v Jayawickrema 1982(1) SLR 349?

3). Did their Lordships at the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by failing to appreciate the

fact that the deed no 1V2 (No 3946) is properly registered as per the law and therefore it should

have the benefit of priority?

This Court had further accepted the following two questions of law raised by the plaintiff-

respondent:

4). Whether the due execution of the Deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 marked as 1V2 is proved

in terms of Section 68 of the Partition Law in the circumstances of this case?

5). If that issue is answered in the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondents favour, whether the

questions referred to in the Petition will not arise?

Learned Counsel for the defendant-appellants and the plaintiff-respondent in the course of their

oral submissions as well as in the written submissions contended that the two main issues that

need to be determined by this Court are:

1. Whether the Deed No. 3936 dated 28.10.1976 had been proved?

and if this question is answered in the affirmative,

SC APPEAL 154/2016

8

2. Whether the said deed should get priority over the deed No 451 dated 02.11.1981, the

deed through which the plaintiff-respondent gained co-ownership to the land in question?

It is settled law, that a party to a partition action is not prevented from alienating or mortgaging

the right to which such party might become entitled after a partition had been decreed in respect

of the land, while the partition action is in progress. However, such transaction becomes

effective to vest rights in the transferee only after the interest is, in law allotted to the party,

namely, only at the stage when the final decree in the partition action is entered. [Sirisoma et al

v Saranelis Appuhamy 51 NLR 337, at 343-345, Subaseris v Prolis 16 NLR 393 at 395, Louis

Appuhami v Punchi Baba 10 NLR 196 at 198, Abdul Ally v Kelaart and Another (1904) 1

Bal 40 at 43-44].

The plaintiff-respondent does not contest existence of such right to a party in a partition action.

However, the issue to be determined by this Court is whether in the given situation, there was

admissible evidence available for the trial judge to consider and hold that Leelawathie, conveyed

the lot or lots that would be allocated to her at the final determination of the partition action

17889/P, to one of the other two co-owners namely Kusumawathie by the deed no 3936 attested

in 1976, while the said partition action was in progress. In other words, whether it was lawful for

the trial judge to have considered the deed produced marked 1V2 in the context of the points

of contest raised and the objections raised in this matter?

The plaintiff-respondent contends, that the learned district judge erred when he decided in favour

of the defendant-appellants by relying on the deed no. 3936 dated 28.10.1976 marked 1V2, for

the reason that the appellants failed to prove the said deed in the course of the trial. To the

contrary, defendant-appellants contend that no formal proof of deed marked 1V2 is required

due to section 68 of the Partition Law No 21 of 1977 as amended.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

9

Section 68 of the Partition Law provides:

It shall not be necessary in any proceedings under this law to adduce formal proof of the

execution of any deed which, on the face of it, purports to have been duly executed, unless the

genuineness of that deed is impeached by a party claiming adversely to the party producing that

deed, or unless the court requires such proof.

The defendant-appellants tendered the deed in question marked 1V2, in the course of the cross

examination of the evidence of the plaintiff-respondent. At that stage the plaintiff-respondent did

not accept the said deed and moved that the deed be tendered subject to proof. However,

defendant-appellants at that stage disputed such requirement. Nonetheless, the learned trial judge

having considered this matter ordered, the said deed be marked subject to proof. However, no

evidence had been presented during the trial to prove the execution of the deed marked 1V2.

When the trial resumed before a new judge on 30 March 2009, the plaintiff-respondent had

moved that the deed marked 1V2 be struck off as it had not been proved. Defendant-appellants at

that stage had re-iterated that no further proof of the said deed was required. It is in this

background that the learned trial judge in his judgement dated 03 September 2009 held that there

is no requirement to prove the deed 1V2. The learned trial judge arrived at the said conclusion

on the premise that the plaintiff-respondent had not challenged and impeached the genuineness

of the deed 1V2 in his plaint and therefore did not have a right to raise point of contest No. 12

namely Whether the deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the statement of claim of the

two Defendants is a fraudulent deed. Furthermore, the learned trial judge held that the need to

answer point of contest No. 12 did not arise, as the plaintiff-respondent did not impeach the said

deed in the pleadings of the plaint. The learned trial judge was of the view that provisions in

section 68 of the Partition Law can be invoked in favour of the defendant-appellants in this

matter.

The plaintiff-respondent in this matter raised point of contest No. 12 namely Whether the

deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the statement of claim of the two Defendants is a

fraudulent deed, as a further issue, after the defendant-appellants raised the point of contest No.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

10

5 namely whether Leelawathie referred to in paragraph 3 of the plaint transferred all her rights

to Suduwahewage Kusumawathie by the deed no 3936 attested by Valentine Dias Notary on 28

October 1976. Therefore, the plaintiff respondent by raising the point of contest No. 12 had

impeached the genuineness of the deed 1V2 at the first given opportunity in these proceedings.

The learned trial judge erred when he held that the plaintiff did not have a right to raise the point

of contest No. 12 on the premise that he has no such right as he failed to challenge the

genuineness of the said deed in the plaint. It is settled law that the issues or points of contest in a

civil case need not be confined to the pleadings. (Attorney-General v Smith 8 NLR 229 at 241,

Silva v Obeyesekera 24 NLR 97 at 107, The Bank of Ceylon, Jaffna v Chelliahpillai 64 NLR

25 at 27, De Alwis v De Alwis 76 NLR 444 at 448). Furthermore, the plaintiff-respondent in his

evidence refused to accept the deed 1V2. He further contended that the defendant-appellants

failed to produce this deed at the police inquiry held consequent to a compliant he made.

According to his evidence, police had called all the parties to attend the inquiry with respective

deeds. The defendant-appellants did not produce any deed at that stage whereas the plaintiff-

respondent produced the deed of transfer P3. This portion of evidence of the plaintiff-respondent

had neither been challenged nor contradicted by the defendant-appellants. When all of these facts

are taken together, I am of the view that the plaintiff-respondent had in fact impeached the

genuineness of the deed 1V2 and therefore the trial judge should not have dispensed with the

formal proof of the deed 1V2 relying on section 68 of the Partition Law. Hence, it remained

the duty of the trial judge to have considered whether the deed marked 1V2 has been proved in

accordance with the law.

Section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code mandates that;

No document shall be placed on the record unless it has been proved or admitted in accordance

with the law of evidence for the time being in force.

Furthermore, section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that;

SC APPEAL 154/2016

11

If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one

attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an

attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of court and capable of giving evidence.

At the trial, defendant-appellants did not present any evidence to establish the execution of the

deed marked 1V2. On behalf of the defendant-appellants, it was submitted before this court

that the dispensation of the proof of execution of the deed 1V2 being lawful on the basis that

the execution of a document impeached as having been obtained by fraud need not be proved

unless particulars of the alleged fraud relate to its due execution, such as that the execution of the

document was done in blank. This proposition is based on the observation of Lawrie ACJ in

Baronchy Appu v Podihamy (1902) 2 Brownies Reports 221 at 222.

Lawrie ACJ in the said case observed;

It has, I think been decided that when a deed is impeached as having been obtained by

fraud it is not necessary to prove its execution by calling the attesting witnesses.

He further observed that;

I am inclined to think that the evidence of at least one of the attesting witnesses was

necessary to prove that it was a document which was signed, and not a blank sheet of

paper.

The Court of Appeal in Piyadasa v Binduva alias Gunasekera, [1992] 1 SLR 108 at 109

having cited the aforementioned observation of Lawrie ACJ observed;

SC APPEAL 154/2016

12

this decision supports the view that a document formally and duly executed need not be

proved even if the signature of the executant was obtained by fraud or deception, but

where the document was fraudulently or illegally executed, the due execution must be

proved, because the alleged execution is in fact no execution at all.

These two judgements tend to support the proposition that in situations where a party who signed

a deed takes up the position that he signed the deed due to a fraud or deception practiced on him,

no formal proof of the execution is warranted. Such contention is on the premise that such

position amounts to an admission on the execution of the deed. Such a proposition is in line

with section 70 of the Evidence Ordinance, which reads as:

The admission of a party to an attested document of its execution by himself shall be sufficient

proof of its execution as against him, though it be a document required by law to be attested

However, such a proposition does not support the contention that no formal proof of the

execution of a deed is warranted as provided under section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code

read with section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance, when the genuineness of such deed is

impeached as provided under section 68 of the Partition Law. Instances on which the

genuineness of a deed can be impeached is far wider than the specific instance of a specific

position that a person signed the deed due to a fraud or a deception practiced on him. To the

contrary, section 68 of the Partition Law provides that no formal proof is required in situations

when a deed on the face of it purports to have been duly executed unless the genuineness of

the deed is impeached by a party claiming adversely to the party producing that deed (emphasis

added).

Therefore, in a partition action when the genuineness of a deed is impeached, the party who

seeks to make his claim based on such deed should provide evidence of its execution as required

SC APPEAL 154/2016

13

under section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance, unless law dispenses with, such proof. The evidentiary requirement arising under

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance is aptly discussed by the Supreme Court in its decision in

Samarakoon v Gunasekera [2011] 1 SLR 149.

In Samarakoon v Gunasekera (supra at 154) the Supreme Court held;

A deed for the sale or transfer of land, being a document which is required by law to

be attested, has to be proved in the manner set out in section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance by proof that the maker (the vendor) of that document signed it in the

presence of witnesses and the notary. If this is not done the document and its contents

cannot be used in evidence.

Further explaining the factual position that arose in that case and explaining the legal proposition

in the proper context the Supreme Court further observed;

In the present case, the defendants had not challenged the due execution of deeds P3,

P5 and P6. When they objected to those documents at the time the same were marked in

evidence what they did was to challenge the plaintiff to prove those documents in the

proper way in which a document required by law to be attested has to be proved if it is to

be used as evidence. The plaintiff thus had notice that he had to prove P3, P5 and P6 in

the manner provided in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. He had failed to lead the

evidence necessary to prove those documents in accordance with the provisions of

section 68. At the close of the plaintiffs case when the documents marked were read in

evidence the defendants have stated that documents not proved should be excluded. This

was a reference to documents marked subject to proof and proved in accordance with the

law. In view of the failure of the plaintiff to prove documents P3, P5 and P6 on which the

title claimed by him depended, the learned trial Judge had rightly excluded those

documents and had held that the plaintiff had failed to prove his title.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

14

Similarly, in my view in the instant case also, trial judges decision to consider deed marked

1V2 as evidence and decide the devolution of title based on the purported transfer of rights by

Leelawathie to Kusumawathie, without formal proof of deed marked 1V2, is contrary to

section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Thereby the learned trial judge had erred in law when he held in favour of the defendant-

appellants based on the deed 1V2 which was not proved in accordance with the law. The

Supreme Court in Perera & Others v Elisahamy (1961) 65 CLW 59, considering the

applicability of section 69 of the Partition Act (the provision similar to section 68 of the Partition

Law) observed:

Section 69 of the Partition Act is of no avail in the instant case as that section does not

apply to cases in which the genuineness is impeached or the Court requires its proof. (at

page 60)

Citing with approval the judgment of the Privy Council in [(1928) A.I.R (Privy Council) 127] the

court further observed:

A court cannot act on facts which are not proved. (at page 60)

The plaintiff-respondents claim to the land in question and the devolution of title is based on the

final decree in District Court of Gampaha Case P/17889 and Deed No 451 dated 02.11.1981

which was produced marked P3. Defendant-appellants did not impeach the genuineness of the

deed marked P3. Furthermore, one of the attesting witnesses to this deed did testify at the trial.

Therefore, the plaintiff had proved his rights to the land and the learned trial judge had erred

when he failed to consider plaintiffs rights as proved by evidence in court.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

15

In view of the reasons enumerated hereinbefore, I am of the view that the trial judges decision

to answer point of contest No. 2 as Entitled as per the judgment and the decision to answer

points of contest Nos. 5 and 7 namely Whether Leelawathie who is referred to in paragraph 3 of

the plaint had transferred all her rights to Suduwa Hewage Kusumawathie by the deed No 3936

attested by Notary Valentine Dias on 28 November 1976? and whether all rights to the

relevant land should be vested with the 1a and 2a defendants in line with their statement of

claim? in the affirmative, is an error of law.

I hold that the point of contest No. 2 should be answered in the affirmative and points of contest

Nos. 5 and 7 should be answered in the negative.

I see no reason to deviate from the decision of the learned judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court where they have held that the learned trial judge erred when he concluded that no rights

could be devolved on the plaintiff-respondent based on deed P3. Furthermore I hold that the

rights of the parties should be decided as determined by the Civil Appellate High Court.

Therefore I affirm the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha dated 17

December 2014.

However, the learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had proceeded further and

answered point of contest No 12 - Whether the deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the

statement of claim of the two Defendants is a fraudulent deed (js;a;slrejkaf.a ysuslus

m%ldYfha ioyka wxl 3936 iy 19761028 osk orK je,kaghska vhia fkd;drsia ;ek iy;sl

l< Tmamqj jxpksl f,i ilia lrk ,o Tmamqjla o?) - in the affirmative after holding that the

learned trial judge erred when he answered point of contest No. 12 Does not arise. The

learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court arrived at this finding in the process of

resolving the issue that they identified as the most important issue in this matter. According to

them, whether the deed bearing no. 3936 (which was produced marked 1V2) could be

considered to be a genuine deed due to the reason that the said deed remained a deed which was

SC APPEAL 154/2016

16

not proved as the plaintiff demanded that the said deed be produced subject to proof. The

learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had formulated this question on the assumption

that the failure to prove the relevant deed leads to the conclusion or an inference that the said

deed is a fraudulent deed. In my view such construction is a misdirection of fact and law.

The sole impact of the challenge to the genuineness of the said deed by the plaintiff respondent

in this matter is on the mode of proving the said deed in court. As discussed earlier in this

judgment, when a party to a partition action impeaches the genuineness of a deed claiming

adversely to the party which produces such deed, such second mentioned party cannot invoke the

benefit under section 68 of the Partition Law but should proceed to prove the execution of such

deed as provided under section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 68 of the

Evidence Ordinance. However, the failure to prove the execution of a deed as required under

aforesaid circumstances per se in the absence of any other evidence to establish the fraudulent

nature of the deed, could not lead to an adverse conclusion on the genuineness of the deed. Such

a failure would lead to a situation that the contents of such deed cannot be considered as

evidence by court, only.

Therefore, the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges decision to answer point of contest no.

12 namely Whether the deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 pleaded in the statement of claim of the

two Defendants is a fraudulent deed (js;a;slrejkaf.a ysuslus m%ldYfha ioyka wxl 3936 iy

19761028 osk orK je,kaghska vhia fkd;drsia ;ek iy;sl l< Tmamqj jxpksl f,i ilia

lrk ,o Tmamqjla o?), in the affirmative is an error of fact and law.

Hence, the judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court in this matter dated 17 December 2017

is varied. Accordingly I hold that the answer of the learned trial judge to point of contest no. 12

namely does not arise should remain unaltered, due to the reasons enumerated hereinbefore.

SC APPEAL 154/2016

17

In view of the foregoing reasons, I proceed to answer legal issue No 4 raised before this Court

(Whether the due execution of the Deed No 3936 dated 28.10.1976 marked as 1V2 is proved in

terms of Section 68 of the Partition Law in the circumstances of this case?) in the negative and

legal issue No 5 (If that issue is answered in the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondents favour,

whether the questions referred to in the Petition will not arise?) in the affirmative. In view of

these findings the need to answer other legal issues does not arise.

I hold that the rights of the parties should be decided as determined by the Civil Appellate High

Court of Gampaha in the judgment dated 17 December 2014 and therefore affirm the judgment

of the Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha dated 17 December 2014 subject to the variation

on its decision relating to the point of contest No. 12, as decided hereinbefore. The appeal of the

two defendant-appellants is dismissed with costs.
