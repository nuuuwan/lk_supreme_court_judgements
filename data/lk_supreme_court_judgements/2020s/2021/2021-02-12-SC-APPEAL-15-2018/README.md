Madavan Sadanandan and were sentenced to death by the judgment of the High

Court dated 24.1.2011. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence,

the Accused-Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal

by its judgment dated 7.4.2017 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction

and the sentence. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, the

Accused-Appellants have appealed to this court. The 4th accused, at the end of the

trial, was acquitted by the learned High Court Judge. This court by its order dated

12.2.2018 granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraph 16(i)

and 16(v) of the Petition of Appeal dated 16.5.2017 which are set out below.

1. Whether their Lordships of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to evaluate

the evidence in the case in its totality and failed to appreciate the same on an

impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence whether there was clearly,

at the very least a reasonable doubt as to the participation of the 2nd and 3rd

Petitioners to the alleged offences?

2. Have their Lordships of the Court of Appeal failed to apply the test of

probability in evaluating the testimonial trustworthiness of PW2’s evidence

and thereby deprived the Petitioners the substance of a fair trial guaranteed

under Article 13 of the Constitution?

3. Whether the learned High Court Judge erred in law on the principles relating

to burden of proof on the defence of alibi.

The 3rd question of law which was raised by learned counsel for the Accused-

Appellants was permitted by this court at the hearing of granting of leave to appeal

on 12.2.2018.

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows.

SC Appeal 15/2018

On the day of the incident (9.2.2003) when the deceased person Madavan

Sadanandan and Murugasu Ravindran were going to cut firewood, they met the

Accused-Appellants and the 4th Accused near the Kovil and they asked the

deceased person whether he was a big person to which the deceased person replied

that he was going to work. At this stage, there was an exchange of words between

the deceased person and the accused persons. The accused persons then started

attacking the deceased person. The 1st Accused-Appellant attacked the deceased

person with a knife. The 2nd and the 3rd Accused-Appellants attacked the deceased

person with two clubs. The 4th Accused attacked the deceased person with his

hands. When the deceased person was being attacked, he ran away towards his

house and all four accused chased after him. Murugase Ravindran who was

watching the incident says in his evidence that the deceased person ran for about

20 feet. The 1st Accused-Appellant threatened Murugase Ravindran not to give

evidence on the incident. Thereafter Murugase Ravindran went home. The above

facts have been stated by Murugase Ravindran in his evidence. Later the people

found that the deceased person lying fallen near the Kovil. According to the

evidence of wife of the deceased person Weeranan Erulai, the distance between the

Kovil and the place where the deceased person was lying fallen was 30 feet. But

according to the evidence of the investigating officer, this distance was about 100

meters.

Learned counsel who appeared for the Accused-Appellants submitted that the

incident described by witness Murugase Ravindran was an incident which had

taken place prior to the main incident. But Murugase Ravindran, in his evidence,

clearly says that when the deceased person was being attacked, he (the deceased

person) ran away and the four accused persons chased after him (the deceased

person). Thus, according to the evidence of Murugase Ravindran, this was the

SC Appeal 15/2018

5

main incident. There was no evidence led at the trial to establish that the deceased

person was attacked at the place where he was lying fallen. For the above reasons,

I am unable to agree with the above submission of learned counsel for the

Accused-Appellants.

Learned counsel for the Accused-Appellants contended that no reliance can be

placed on Murugase Ravindran’s evidence as he has made a belated statement. I

now advert to this contention. It is true that he has made a statement ten days after

the incident. There were reasons for this delay. Murugase Ravindran who was only

fifteen (15) years old at the time of the incident was threatened by the 1st Accused-

Appellant not to give evidence in this case. According to the evidence of Murugase

Ravindran, this was the reason for the delay in making the statement. When

considering the contention whether the evidence of a belated witness can be

accepted or not, I would like to consider certain judicial decisions.

In SumanasenaVs Attorney General[1999] 3 SLR 137 at page 140, His Lordship

Justice Jayasuriya held as follows.

"just because the witness is a belated witness the Court ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone and that a Court must inquire into the reason for the

delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court could act

on the evidence of a belated witness.

In Ajith Samarakoon Vs the Republic [2004] 2 SLR 209 at page 220 His Lordship

Justice Jayasuriya held as follows. His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya held as follows.

Just because the statement of a witness is belated the Court is not entitled to reject

such testimony. In applying the Test of Spontaneity the Test of Contemporaneity

and the Test of Promptness the Court ought to scrupulously proceed to examine the

reasons for the delay. If the reasons for the delay adduced by the witness are

SC Appeal 15/2018

6

justifiable and probable the trial Judge is entitled to act on the evidence of a

witness who had made a belated statement.

Considering the above legal literature, I hold that court should not reject the

evidence of a witness who has made a belated statement to the Police if the delay

has been explained. In the present case the delay in making the statement to the

Police has been explained. Thus the decision of the learned trial Judge to accept the

evidence of witness Murugase Ravindran cannot be found fault with.

According to the evidence of Dr. Manjula who conducted the Post Mortem

Examination, there were cut injuries, lacerations and a contusion on the body of the

deceased person. Thus, it is seen that the evidence of Murugase Ravindran has

been corroborated by medical evidence. When the above matters are considered,

the evidence of Murugase Ravindran can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned trial Judge and the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal were, in my

view, correct when they decided to act on the evidence of Murugase Ravindran.

For the above reasons, I reject the above contention of learned counsel for the

Accused-Appellant.

Prosecution has relied on a dying declaration made by the deceased person to his

wife Weeranan Irulai. According to Weeranan Irulai, she, on hearing that her

husband had been attacked, went to the place where the deceased person was lying

fallen. On being questioned as to who cut him, he (the deceased person) replied

that Alli cut him, Ukkun and Weeraman assaulted him with a club. She has

identified Alli as the 1st Accused, Ukkun as the 3rd Accused and Weeraman as the

2nd Accused. Thereafter she has gone to the Police Station and made a statement.

Question was raised as to why she did not take the deceased person to the hospital

in the same van. It has to be noted here that she had had no control over the

SC Appeal 15/2018

7

vehicle. No one knows whether the van driver refused to take the injured person in

the van to the hospital. However, what is important here is to consider whether the

deceased person could have spoken when she spoke to him. Dr Manjula says in his

evidence that the deceased person could have spoken for about one hour after

receiving injuries and he had the capacity to move.

According to the evidence of Weeranan Irulai, the deceased person in his dying

declaration had mentioned that all three Accused-Appellants had attacked him.

Although the deceased person had referred to all three accused persons in his dying

declaration, Weeranan Irulai, in her first statement made to the Police, has failed to

mention the attack on the deceased person by the 2nd and 3rd Accused persons. She

has mentioned this fact only in her 2nd statement made to the Police. According to

Dr Manjula, the deceased person could have spoken for about one hour after

receiving injuries. Further, according to the evidence of Dr. Manjula who

conducted the Post Mortem Examination, there were cut injuries, lacerations and a

contusion on the body of the deceased person. Thus, it is seen that the evidence of

Weeranan Irulai is corroborated by the evidence of Dr Manjula. Weeranan Irulai

has also said in her evidence that the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th accused persons were ten

feet away from place where the deceased person was lying fallen when she went to

this place and the 1st accused person was having a knife. When I consider all the

above matters, I am unable to find fault with the decisions of the learned trial

Judge and the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in accepting the evidence of

Weeranan Irulai.

The 2nd and the 3rd Accused-Appellants in their dock statements have taken up the

position that they went to work in the morning and came back in evening. Thus,

they have taken the defence of alibi. However, the learned Judge has placed a

SC Appeal 15/2018

8

burden on the accused persons to prove the defence of alibi. I will now consider

whether the learned trial Judge was correct when he took the above decision. When

an accused person takes up the defence an alibi, the burden is on the prosecution to

establish that he was present at the place where the offence was committed. I

would like to consider certain judicial decisions on this point. In Banda and Others

Vs Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 169 Justice FND Jayasuriya at page 170 held

as follows.

“There is no burden whatsoever on an accused person who puts forward a

plea of alibi and the burden is always on the prosecution to establish beyond

reasonable doubt that the accused was not elsewhere but present at the time of

the commission of the criminal offence.”

In Punchi Banda Vs The State 76 NLR 293 at page 308 His Lordship Justice GPA

Silva held as follows.

“Where the defence was that of an alibi and an accused person had no burden

as such of establishing any fact to any degree of probability.”

Considering the above matters, I hold that when an alibi is pleaded by an accused

person, there is no burden on the accused person to prove it. Therefore, I hold that

the learned trial Judge has committed misdirection in law when he placed a burden

on the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants to prove the defence of alibi.

Although the2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants raised a defence of alibi in their dock

statements, they failed to suggest this position to witness Murugase Ravindran.

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs State of Punjab [2002] AIR SC (iii)3652 at 3656

the Indian Supreme Court held as follows. "It is a rule of essential justice that

whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his

SC Appeal 15/2018

9

case in cross examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted." This judgment was cited with approval in Bobby Mathew

vs. State of Karnatake 2004 Cr. LJ Vol iii page 3003.

Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that

failure on the part of the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants to suggest to the

prosecution witness Murugase Ravindran their position (defence of alibi) indicates

that the defence of alibi is a false one.

Further I would like to consider the proviso to Section 334 of the Criminal

Procedure Code which reads as follows. “Provided that the court may,

notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be

decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no

substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.”

I have earlier pointed out that the learned trial Judge has committed misdirection in

law when he placed a burden on the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants to prove the

defence of alibi. Although the learned trial Judge has committed the above

misdirection in law, when the evidence led at the trial is considered, I hold that no

substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred to the accused. In this

connection I would like to consider the judgment of this court in the case of MHM

Lafeer Vs The Queen 74 NLR 246 wherein this court at page 248 held as follows.

“There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning the

standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the cogent

and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not have

reasonably returned a more favourable verdict. We therefore affirm the

conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.”

SC Appeal 15/2018

The next question that I would like to consider is whether the conviction of murder

can be maintained. I now advert to this question. Witness Murugase Ravindran, in

his evidence, stated the following matters.

1. There was an exchange of words between the deceased person and the

accused persons.

2. The deceased person was using filthy language when both parties were

exchanging words.

3. At the time of the attack on the deceased person, there was a fight between

two parties. [pages 50 to 51].

When I consider the above evidence, I feel that the conviction of murder cannot be

maintained and the Accused-Appellants should have been convicted on the offence

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder which is an offence punishable

under Section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of sudden fight. For the above

reasons, I set aside the conviction of murder and the sentence of death imposed on

the Accused-Appellants and convict them for the offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder on the basis of sudden fight which is an offence punishable

under Section 297 of the Penal Code. I sentence each of the Accused-Appellants to

a term of 16 (sixteen) years rigorous imprisonment. I further direct that this term of

imprisonment should be implemented from the date of sentence of death

(24.1.2011).

In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the 1st and the 2nd questions of

law in the negative. I answer the 3rd question of law as follows. The learned trial

Judge (High Court Judge) erred in law on the principles relating to the burden of

proof on the defence of alibi. The learned High Court Judge of Colombo is directed

SC Appeal 15/2018

11

to issue a fresh committal in accordance with the sentence imposed by this court.

Subject to the above variation of the conviction and the sentence, the appeal of the

Accused-Appellants is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
