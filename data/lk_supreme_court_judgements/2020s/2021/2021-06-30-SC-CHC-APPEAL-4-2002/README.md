Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner-Appellant, The Maharaja Organisation Limited

(Petitioner), filed an appeal by way of a Petition of Appeal dated

15.09.2000 before the Commercial High Court in terms of

section 182 of the Code of Intellectual Property Act, No. 52 of

1979, against the order of the Director of Intellectual Property

dated 28.05.1998, made after an inquiry held under section

107(13) of the Code. By this order, the Director of Intellectual

Property decided to register Mark No. 61297 of the 1st

Respondent-Respondent, Viacom International Inc. (1st

Respondent) despite opposition by the Petitioner.

The 1st Respondent in the answer inter alia took up a

preliminary objection seeking dismissal of the appeal of the

Petitioner in limine on the basis that the Petitioner should have

come before the Commercial High Court against the order of the

Director of Intellectual Property not by way of a Petition of

Appeal but by way of a plaint. The Commercial High Court by

order dated 14.12.2001 upheld this preliminary objection

without going into the merits of the appeal and rejected the

Petition of Appeal allowing the Petitioner to come before the

same Court by way of a plaint, if so advised. The Petitioner did

not file a plaint in the Commercial High Court but instead filed a

final appeal against the said order under section 754(1) of the

Civil Procedure Code read with section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

At the argument before this Court, in addition to the merits of

the appeal, learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Respondent,

drawing attention to the Full Bench decision of this Court in

4

Chettiar v. Chettiar [2011] BLR 25, [2011] 2 Sri LR 70, submitted

that this appeal of the Petitioner from the order of the

Commercial High Court shall be dismissed in limine as it is

misconceived in law in that the Petitioner should have come

before this Court against the order of the Commercial High

Court not by way of a final appeal made under section 754(1)

read with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code and

sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996, but with the leave of this Court

first had and obtained, i.e. by way of a leave to appeal

application made under section 754(2) read with section 754(5)

of the Civil Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

Although learned Presidents Counsel for 1st Respondent has

stressed this point in his further written submissions filed after

the argument, learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has

refrained from addressing this matter in his further written

submissions.

Let me first reproduce sections 754(1), (2) and (5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996:

754 (1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment,

pronounced by any original court in any civil action,

proceeding or matter to which he is a party may prefer an

appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for

any error in fact or in law.

(2) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order

made by any original court in the course of any civil action,

5

proceeding or matter to which he is, or seeks to be a party,

may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such

order for the correction of any error in fact or in law, with

the leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

Ordinance, for the purposes of this chapter

Judgment means any judgment or order having the effect of

a final judgment made by any civil court; and

Order means the final expression of any decision in any

civil action, proceeding or matter, which is not a judgment.

Sections 5 and 6 of Act No. 10 of 1996 whereby the Commercial

High Court was established read as follows:

(5) (1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgement

pronounced by a High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

section 2, in any action, proceeding or matter to which such

person is a party may prefer an appeal to the Supreme

Court against such judgement, for any error in fact or in

law.

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by

a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section

2, in the course of any action, proceeding or matter to which

such person is, or seeks to be, a party, may prefer an

appeal to the Supreme Court against such order for the

correction of any error in fact or in law, with the leave of the

Supreme Court first had and obtained.

6

(3) In this section, the expressions judgement and order

shall have the same meanings respectively, as in section

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

(6) Every appeal to the Supreme Court, and every application

for leave to appeal under section 5 shall be made as nearly

as may be in accordance with the procedure prescribed by

Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

The question whether an appeal or leave to appeal lies against

an order of the District Court or Commercial High Court was a

subject of much controversy for a long period of time. There

were two approaches: the order approach and the application

approach.

In the Supreme Court case of Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd

[1984] 1 Sri LR 286, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) followed the

order approach adopted by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Bozson v.

Altrincham Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547.

Conversely, in the Supreme Court case of Ranjit v.

Kusumawathie [1998] 3 Sri LR 232, Dheeraratne J. followed the

application approach adopted by Lord Esher M.R. in Salaman v.

Warner [1891] 1 QB 734 and Lord Denning M.R. in Salter Rex &

Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597.

The order approach contemplates only the nature of the order.

When taken in isolation, if the order finally disposes of the

matter and the parties rights in litigation without leaving the

suit alive, the order is final and a direct/final appeal is the

proper remedy against such order.

7

The application approach contemplates only the nature of the

application made to Court, not the order delivered per se. In

accordance with this approach, if the order given in one way will

finally dispose of the matter in litigation, but if given in the other

way will allow the action to continue, the order is not final but

interlocutory, in which event, leave to appeal is the proper

remedy. In other words, according to the application approach,

if the order, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally

determine the matter in litigation, the order is final.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court (comprising five Justices)

was called upon to decide on this vexed question in Chettiar v.

Chettiar [2011] 2 Sri LR 70 and [2011] BLR 25. The Court,

having discussed both approaches stemming from English

decisions, unanimously decided that the application approach

(as opposed to the order approach) shall be the criterion in

deciding whether appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy

against an order of the District Court or Commercial High Court.

This Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court was consistently

followed in later Supreme Court decisions. (Yogendra v.

Tharmaratnam (SC/Appeal/87/2009, Supreme Court Minutes of

06.07.2011), Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC/Appeal/03/2009,

Supreme Court Minutes of 16.03.2012), Prof. I.K. Perera v. Prof.

Dayananda Somasundara (SC/Appeal/152/2010, Supreme

Court Minutes of 17.03.2011)

However, notwithstanding this was a Full Bench decision of the

Supreme Court, there were lingering doubts about the

correctness of the decision. Therefore, in Priyanthi Senanayake

v. Chamika Jayantha [2017] BLR 74, a Fuller Bench of the

Supreme Court (comprising seven Justices) revisited the

8

decision in Chettiars case. Eventually, the Fuller Bench also

reached the same conclusion, i.e. the test to be applied is the

application approach and not the order approach.

Chief Justice Dep (with the concurrence of the other six Justices

of the Supreme Court) held:

In order to decide whether an order is a final judgment or

not, it is my considered view that the proper approach is the

approach adopted by Lord Esher in Salamam v. Warner

[1891] 1 QB 734, which was cited with approval by Lord

Denning in Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597. It

stated: If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it

stands, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that

for that purpose of these Rules it is final. On the other

hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally

dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other,

will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

It is abundantly clear that an appeal does not lie against the

impugned order of the Commercial High Court whereby the

Court only rejected the petition of the Petitioner allowing the

Petitioner to present a plaint. This is the relevant part of the

High Court order:

In the circumstances I uphold the preliminary objection

raised by the 1st Respondent and accordingly I reject the

petition of the Petitioner but the rejection of the petition shall

not preclude the Petitioner from presenting a plaint

according to law.

9

There is no necessity to apply the decision in Chettiars case to

this case. The order of the Commercial High Court is prima facie

interlocutory and not final.

What happens if the application approach is adopted? If the

Commercial High Court had overruled the preliminary objection

of the 1st Respondent, the case would not have ended there but

the trial/inquiry would have proceeded and a Judgment on the

merits of the case would have been delivered. Hence the

impugned order is not final.

It is crystal clear that there is no right of appeal against the

impugned order and the final appeal filed by the Petitioner is

misconceived in law. The Petitioner should have come before

this Court against the order of the Commercial High Court not

by way of a final appeal made under section 754(1) read with

section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6

of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.

10 of 1996, but by way of a leave to appeal application made

under section 754(2) read with section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

Although no submission was made on behalf of the 1st

Respondent on the applicability of Chettiars Judgment to the

facts of this case, perhaps for obvious reasons, let me add the

following to clear any doubt.

Chettiars case was decided on 10.06.2010. There was a doubt

about the applicability of this Judgment to final appeals filed

against the orders of the District Court and Commercial High

Court pronounced prior to 10.06.2010. This matter, i.e.

10

whether Chettiars Judgment had retrospective effect, was

specifically raised as a question of law when the decision in

Chettiars case was revisited by the Seven Judge Bench of this

Court in Priyanthi Senanayake v. Chamika Jayantha [2017] BLR

74. However, the Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court did

not even think it fit to grant leave on this question. The Court

only granted leave to appeal to revisit the Five Judge Bench

decision in Chettiars case. Two appeals were amalgamated

before the Seven Judge Bench. In both appeals, the Plaintiffs

cases had been dismissed by the Trial Courts (one by the

District Court and the other by the Commercial High Court) on

preliminary objections taken up by the Defendants. In both

appeals, the impugned orders had been made and final appeals

filed long before Chettiars case was decided. Despite

submissions on this point before the Seven Judge Bench of the

Supreme Court, the Court dismissed the appeals on the basis

that the Plaintiffs should have filed leave to appeal applications

and not final appeals against the impugned orders.

I must state that this is not an application of Chettiars

Judgment retrospectively. By Chettiars Judgment, the Supreme

Court did not make new law. It only declared what has always

been the law. The task of the Court is jus dicere (to say what the

law is) and not jus dare (to make the law). The doctrine of

separation of powers is in harmony with this view. This is

sometimes known as the declaratory theory of law: that judges

do not make the law but only declare what it has always been.

Because the law pre-exists the decision, the question of

retrospective or retroactive application does not arise.

11

Let me add one more point in connection with Chettiars

Judgment. It was held by a Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court

(comprising seven Justices) in Iranganie De Silva v. Indralatha

[2017] BLR 68 that when the language of a statute is clear and

the right of appeal is given in express terms, such as in section

88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, which enacts The order

setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon

default shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon

the facts and specifying the grounds upon which it is made, and

shall be liable to an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision

in Chettiars case has no application.

The preliminary objection raised by the 1st Respondent in the

instant appeal cannot be disregarded as a mere technicality. It

goes to the root of the Petitioners appeal. I uphold the

preliminary objection and dismiss the appeal of the Petitioner

with costs.
