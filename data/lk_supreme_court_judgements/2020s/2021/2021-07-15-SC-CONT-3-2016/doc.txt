first time that she was seeing her.

Facts

On 21st January 2014, Bandumali Jayasinghe by way of a letter addressed to His

Lordship the Chief Justice made a complaint against Attorney-at-Law Ms. Niduk

Perera (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Niduk Perera”). In the said complaint

Bandumali Jayasinghe claimed that after having perused the case record of the

Testamentary Action bearing No. DTS/00151/2012 which had been instituted by

the 1st Petitioner to these proceedings, Hee Jung Kim alias Kim Hee Jung

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Kim Hee Jung”) in respect of the estate of

one Dharman Sathanath Jayasinghe (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

“Dharman Jayasinghe”), she was shocked to discover that a decree of divorce had

been obtained against her by Dharman Jayasinghe in the case bearing No.

DDV.00054/2008 in the District Court of Colombo.

5

She further claimed in her letter that having examined a certified copy of the case

record of the said divorce action, she found that;

a) Dharman Jayasinghe, her ex-husband had filed action on 1st February 2008

seeking a divorce from her.

b) On 15th May 2008 Niduk Perera had tendered a proxy for and on behalf of

her and had also filed answer claiming that instructions had been given by

her to do so.

c) The case was fixed for trial for 3rd July 2008 and had been taken up ex-

parte since there had been no appearance and/or representation on her

behalf .

d) The Court had entered a Decree nisi and ordered it to be served through

registered post and the Fiscal.

e) On 10th October 2008 the Fiscal had reported to the Court that the Decree

nisi had not been served on her.

f) On the same day, an Attorney-at-Law called Ms. Nilu Perera (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as “Nilu Perera”) had appeared as her Attorney and

had informed the Court that she was accepting the notice of the Decree nisi

on behalf of the Respondent.

g) On 30th January 2009, the District Court had made the Decree nisi absolute

on the basis that the said Attorney-at-Law had accepted the Decree nisi on

behalf of her.

Bandumali Jayasinghe had further asserted in the complaint that;

a) She had no knowledge of the divorce action No. DDV/00054/2008 until

she became aware of the testamentary proceedings bearing No.

DTS/00151/2012.

b) She had never received any summons, notice and/or any decree in the

divorce action.

c) She had never met Niduk Perera nor had she ever retained the services of

Niduk Perera in a divorce action.

6

d) She had never instructed Niduk Perera to file a proxy on her behalf and/or

to appear and tender an answer and/or to take any notice in the divorce

action.

e) Niduk Perera had tendered a forged proxy on her behalf and had filed

answer without her instructions. She had also permitted Dharman

Jayasinghe to obtain an ex-parte decree in his favour.

f) One Attorney-at-Law named Nilu Perera had accepted the notice of the

Decree nisi without any instructions having been given by her.

g) She had been severely prejudiced by the illegal conduct of the said Niduk

Perera and/or Nilu Perera and therefore prays that the Supreme Court takes

necessary steps to grant her relief in respect of the injustice caused to her

due to the aforesaid illegal conduct.

In pursuance of this complaint, proceedings commenced in the Supreme Court

under reference No. P/19/2014.

The Court then referred the said matter to the Bar Association [BASL] to hold an

inquiry. The Professional Purposes Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “The Committee”) had held an extensive

inquiry into the complaint and reported to the Supreme Court of their findings by

their report dated 27th January 2015. (“P27”)

The Committee observed that it was unable to come to a finding of any professional

misconduct or breach of professional etiquette on the part of Attorney -at- Law

Niduk Perera and that it could neither accept Bandumali Jayasinghe as a truthful

witness nor believe in her assertions. The Committee recommended to this Court

that no further action should be taken against Niduk Perera and that action should

be taken to issue a Rule on Bandumali Jayasinghe to show cause as to why she

should not be dealt with for contempt of court by intentionally making false

statements to the Supreme Court in the said Inquiry [SC/P19/2014].

However, on 15th November 2014, Bandumali Jayasinghe on the advice of her

legal representatives, withdrew the aforementioned complaint she made to the

Supreme Court against Niduk Perera.

7

Thereafter, by way of a Petition dated 2nd June 2016, the Petitioners in the instant

case invoked the Contempt of Court jurisdiction of the Supreme Court praying that

the Court be pleased to in the first instance issue a Rule on Bandumali Jayasinghe

to show cause as to why she should not be punished or dealt with for contempt of

court by intentionally and/or willfully making false statements to the Supreme

Court.

Accordingly, a Rule was issued by this Court against Bandumali Jayasinghe on 26th

July 2016 and the inquiry commenced.

Evidence led at the Contempt Proceedings No.03/16 at the Supreme Court

Niduk Perera was called as a witness on behalf of the Petitioners and was

questioned before the Supreme Court on 22nd June 2018 and 24th July 2018.

On 22nd June 2018 she identified Bandumali Jayasinghe in court. (at page 11 of

the Contempt proceedings dated 22nd June 2018).

She claimed that up to the 28th of May 2014, which was the day on which

Bandumali Jayasinghe had claimed to have seen her for the very first time, she had

in fact met Bandumali Jayasinghe on more than 10 occasions. She further argued

that Bandumali Jayasinghe was lying in stating that she had never met her and had

never instructed her to file a proxy in the divorce action.

On being questioned, Niduk Perera related the following facts;

She had first come to know Bandumali Jayasinghe in 2008 after having been

recommended to Bandumali Jayasinghe by Varners Law Firm.

She received a telephone call from Bandumali Jayasinghe asking to be represented

by her in the divorce action No.DDV/54/2008.

She had a consultation with Bandumali Jayasinghe at her office prior to summons

being served and she had asked her to meet her again after the summons had been

served.

On being informed by Bandumali Jayasinghe that she had received summons, she

had told her to come and meet her with the summons and the other documents she

had received with it.

8

She had gone through the summons and prepared a printed proxy which she got

Bandumali Jayasinghe to sign and write her NIC Number.

She had compared the number written by Bandumali Jayasinghe with her National

Identity Card and had made a correction as an extra digit [of the ID number] had

been written by Bandumali.

She had told the trial court that Bandumali Jayasinghe was not contesting the

divorce

She was told by Bandumali Jayasinghe that there was a written agreement between

her and Dharman Jayasinghe prior to the divorce action under which they had

agreed to divide their assets.

She stated that Bandumali Jayasinghe had in fact communicated with her through

her mobile phone no 0773186901 and produced detailed call records reflecting

large number of calls between the parties, from 14th March 2008 to October 2008.

(Statements marked as P25, P26 and P27)

She stated that even after the conclusion of the divorce action Bandumali

Jayasinghe had maintained a professional relationship with her.

This was evidenced by;

1.The Power of Attorney No.147, dated 13th December 2009, attested by Niduk

Perera and executed by Bandumali Jayasinghe’s son Ashan Jayasinghe of which

Bandumali Jayasinghe was the first witness. The protocol copy of the Power of

Attorney dated 13th December 2009 No.147 was produced before the Court as

evidence.

(at page 15 of the proceedings of 22nd June 2018 and proceedings dated 24th July

2018)

2.Niduk Perera’s services had been retained to draft a Trust Agreement in respect

of a Trust that Bandumali Jayasinghe and her former husband Dharman

Jayasinghe wanted to establish in the name of their deceased sons, Hiran and Ashan

Jayasinghe.

9

(evidenced by a Letter dated 08th June 2014 from Mr. Nihal Jayewardene, PC

whose advice was sought during the drafting of the Trust Agreement) marked as

P34.

3.Emails had been sent by Bandumali Jayasinghe to Niduk Perera regarding the

Trust matter (P36)

4. A ‘friend request’ sent to Niduk Perera by Bandumali Jayasinghe on the social

media platform ‘Facebook’ to add her as a Friend. (The email notification of the

friend request is marked as P35).

These instances clearly establish the fact that Bandumali Jayasinghe knew who

Niduk Perera was and had a professional relationship with her even after the

divorce had been finalized.

Evidence given in SC Proceedings No. P/19/2014 with respect to Bandumali

Jayasinghe’s complaint against Niduk Perera.

After the complaint was filed by Bandumali Jayasinghe against Niduk Perera, the

latter gave a detailed account of her professional relationship with Bandumali

Jayasinghe by way of two affidavits, i.e. Observations to the Supreme Court dated

10th June 2014 (marked as “P20”) and an affidavit tendered to the Inquiry

Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka dated 31st October 2014 (marked as

“P23”)

Although this material pertains to the issue of determining whether Niduk Perera

was guilty of professional misconduct, it is pivotal in the present action for this

court to determine whether Bandumali Jayasinghe’s allegations are in fact true.

As was stated in Niduk Perera’s two Affidavits;

She had first come to know Bandumali Jayasinghe in 2008 when Bandumali

Jayasinghe had contacted her via phone and had asked her to represent her

(Bandumali Jayasinghe) in the divorce action No. DDV/0054/08.

Then on or about 2nd April 2008, Bandumali Jayasinghe had come to meet her at

her office and had instructed her on the said divorce action.

10

She had been informed by Bandumali Jayasinghe that she and Dharman Jayasinghe

had agreed to dissolve their marriage and had already negotiated and executed a

divorce settlement, as to how the assets were to be divided between them.

Bandumali Jayasinghe had also related that she received monies from Dharman

Jayasinghe and that she had already executed certain deeds, acting in terms of the

post-nuptial agreement. (vide Paragraph 5a of P20)

Regarding the divorce action, Bandumali Jayasinghe had instructed her that she

would not be contesting the action and had asked for a speedy conclusion of the

action without her having to participate in the legal proceedings. This was,

according to her, the first professional duty, she had performed on behalf of

Bandumali Jayasinghe in respect of this case. (vide page 10 of the proceedings

dated 22nd June 2018)

Thereafter, Bandumali Jayasinghe had met her again at her office and had handed

over the said summons and the Plaint which had been delivered along with the

summons. (at paragraph 5c of P20).

She had then prepared a printed proxy and had obtained Bandumali Jayasinghe’s

signature and had got her to write down her National Identity Card number in her

own handwriting. She had then checked the number by comparing it with the

National Identity Card and having seen that Bandumali Jayasinghe had written an

extra digit got her to delete the same. (Proxy is marked as ‘P17’). The place where

Bandumali Jayasinghe’s signature appears is marked as P17 (a) and where the NIC

number of Bandumali Jayasinghe appears is marked as P17 (b))

Niduk Perera maintained that she then drafted the Answer on Bandumali

Jayasinghe’s instructions denying the allegations contained in the Plaint and had

made a plea of counter divorce as Bandumali Jayasinghe wanted to end the

marriage as well. (vide paragraph 5(d) of P20)

When the case was called in the District Court of Colombo, she had appeared on

behalf of Bandumali Jayasinghe and had filed her proxy as well as the Answer.

(paragraph 5e P20)

11

Thereafter, she had sought further instructions from Bandumali Jayasinghe as to

whether she wished to pursue a divorce in her favour or refrain from contesting

her husband’s action. (vide Paragraph 24 of P23). She claims that Bandumali

Jayasinghe had instructed her that she did not wish to contest the case and wanted

her to take the necessary steps to expedite the divorce.

On 28th May 2008 she had appeared on behalf of Bandumali Jayasinghe and had

informed the court that she would not be contesting the action, after which the

court fixed the case for trial on 3rd July 2008. (journal entry no. 3 at page 3 of

annexure x1) (paragraph 25 of P23)

On 3rd July 2008, she had appeared in the District Court of Colombo on behalf of

Bandumali Jayasinghe and the case was refixed for 29th August 2008 (Journal

Entry No.4) (paragraph 27 of P23). However, after she had left, the case had been

taken up again and an ex parte decree nisi had been entered in favour of Dharman

Jayasinghe.

She had then informed Bandumali Jayasinghe about the ex parte proceedings.

Bandumali Jayasinghe not having been too concerned, had insisted on having the

action concluded as soon as possible as there was a sum of money that she was to

receive once the case was over, in terms of a post-nuptial agreement between her

and Dharman Jayasinghe. (Para 30 P23)

Sometime later Bandumali Jayasinghe had informed her that an officer of the court

had visited her house in Dompe but had not been able to serve the Decree Nisi as

she was then residing at Longden Place, Colombo 07. However, she had gone on

to say that the Decree Nisi that had been sent to her under registered cover, had

reached her.

Bandumali Jayasinghe had then specifically instructed her to appear in Court on

the next date and to consent to conclude the divorce action which would assure

her receiving the balance payment promised under the divorce agreements. (Para

31 P23)

12

Accordingly, she had appeared in court on 10th October 2008 and took notice of

the decree nisi and thereafter the case had been re-fixed for 30th January 2009 to

make the decree nisi absolute. (paragraph 32 of P23)

She had called Bandumali Jayasinghe the day before the decree nisi was to be made

absolute to make sure she had not changed her mind (Paragraph32 p23) (detailed

bill of outgoing calls from Niduk Perera to Bandumali Jayasinghe from 15th

September 2008 to 14th October 2008 R47 (a) (b))

On 30th January 2009 she had appeared once again in court and the decree nisi

had been made absolute. Certified copies of the decree nisi and decree absolute had

been handed over to Bandumali Jayasinghe. (para 33 p23)

(Statements marked as P25, P26 and P27)

This evidence clearly and unequivocally demonstrates the client-lawyer

relationship between these two individuals, and that Niduk Perera’s services had

been obtained by Bandumali Jayasinghe to appear on her behalf in the divorce

action No. DDV/00054/08 and had appointed her as her attorney on record by

duly signing the proxy.

Bandumali Jayasinghe’s evidence

The evidence given by Bandumali Jayasinghe in order to support the allegations

she had made against Niduk Perera warrant an extensive examination in order to

ascertain whether she did in fact attempt to mislead the Supreme Court and

thereby interfere with the administration of justice, thereby committing the offence

of Contempt of court.

Despite Bandumali Jayasinghe’s contention in the written submission dated 21st

August 2020 tendered on her behalf, regarding the powers of the Committee to

conduct an inquiry, the Supreme Court will not delve into the matter of whether

or not the Committee had the mandate to carry out an inquiry and make

recommendations. The fact of the matter is that Bandumali Jayasinghe did attend

the said inquiry and give evidence before it. Therefore, we see no reason why the

Supreme Court, independent of the findings of the Committee, could not take into

13

account the aforesaid evidence in order to ascertain whether she came before the

Supreme Court and made false representations.

The Court will therefore inquire into the contents of her complaint to the Supreme

Court dated 21st January 2014, her Affidavit to the Supreme Court dated 27th June

2014 (marked as P21), as well as her Affidavit to the Inquiry Committee of the Bar

Association of Sri Lanka dated 25th August 2014 (P22) and the proceedings of the

BASL inquiry (marked as P24(a), P24 (b), P24(c), P24(d), P24(e), P24(f)). All of

this evidence pertains to the proceedings relating to the complaint she had made

against Niduk Perera, but nevertheless warrants examination in the present case,

given the fact that the key issue is whether she made false representations to the

Supreme Court and is therefore guilty of contempt of court.

Evidence given by Bandumali Jayasinghe in support of her allegations.

(i) That she had never met Niduk Perera and did not even know her by name.

One claim made by Bandumali Jayasinghe against Niduk Perera was that she had

never met her and had never retained her services in the divorce action. (vide

Paragraph 8 of the Complaint).

She reiterated this in her Affidavit to the Supreme Court (“P21”) (para 4 and para

13) as well as in her Affidavit to the Professional Purposes Committee of the Bar

Association of Sri Lanka (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “The Committee”)

(P21 at paragraph 43). Furthermore, when the Supreme Court confronted

Bandumali Jayasinghe in open Court as to whether she had met Niduk Perera

previously, she replied by saying that she had never seen her and that it was the

first time that she was seeing her. (SC Proceedings of 28th May 2014). Even at the

inquiry conducted by the Committee, on 30th August 2014 she claimed that it was

at the Supreme Court that she had seen Niduk Perera for the first time. (Pages 4,

25-26)

However, on 6th September 2012 Bandumali Jayasinghe admitted to the

Committee, under cross-examination, that she had met Niduk Perera or someone

resembling her before on several occasions. (page 40)

14

(ii) That Niduk Perera had tendered a forged proxy on her behalf in the said

divorce action and had filed answer without her instructions.

The crux of Bandumali Jayasinghe’s complaint is that, unbeknown to her, Niduk

Perera had acted and appeared on her behalf in the divorce action bearing No.

DDV/00054/2008. She claimed that Niduk Perera had tendered a forged proxy

and an answer without having received any instructions from her to do so.

She has reaffirmed this allegation in her Affidavit to the Supreme Court (P21) (vide

Paragraph 19) and in her Affidavit to the Committee (P22) (vide paragraph 40).

However, during the inquiry, she not only admitted to signing the proxy

(proceedings dated 31.08.2014 at page 31), but it was also discovered that the

photocopies of a certified copy of the proxy that had been tendered by her as

evidence to the Supreme Court had been tampered with (proceedings dated 6th

September 2014). Bandumali Jayasinghe could not vouch for the genuineness of

the document she produced as the proxy and did not answer when asked whether

she could swear that it hadn’t been tampered with. (proceedings of 30th August

2014 page 28)

(iii) That she never received any notice, summons and/or any decree in the said

divorce action.

In Bandumali Jayasinghe’s affidavit to the Supreme Court (P21), she affirmed that

she did not receive summons and that although the signature placed on the

“precept to fiscal to serve” appears to be hers it was in fact not hers. (vide

paragraph 7)

She has reiterated this assertion in her Affidavit to the Committee (P22).

(Paragraph 41-42)

However, under cross-examinationon13th September 2014, she has admitted that

she did receive the summons, had signed it and did not take it seriously. (at page

27). This is further established by Journal Entry No.2 of the Case record of DDV-

00054-08 which states that summons had been personally served on Bandumali

15

Jayasinghe by the Fiscal on 2nd May 2008, as well as by the Fiscal’s affidavit dated

2nd May 2008.

in June 2012, Bandumali Jayasinghe instituted a testamentary case No. DTS-

00134-12 in respect of the estate of the deceased Ashan Jayasinghe in the District

Court of Colombo. During the course of the testamentary proceedings, Bandumali

Jayasinghe’s lawyers had submitted the decree absolute of her divorce from

Dharman Jayasinghe by way of a motion on 27th June 2012. She has denied all

knowledge of that motion. (page 20 of the proceedings dated 13th September

2014)

The contradictory position taken by Bandumali Jayasinghe on material points, is a

clear indication of the fact that she had not been truthful, that her version lacks

credibility and that she has wantonly misrepresented facts to the Supreme Court

(iv) That she had no knowledge of the Divorce case

All of her allegations against Niduk Perera are fundamentally based not only on

her assertion that she did not grant a proxy to her, but also on her claim that she

knew nothing about the divorce action instituted by her husband Dharman

Jayasinghe.

Her assertion that she had no knowledge of the fact that the divorce action No.

DDV/00054/2008 was filed by Dharman Jayasinghe and that she only found out

about it when the testamentary action bearing No. DTA 15/2012 was filed by Kim

Hee Jung with regard to his estate, has been restated in her Affidavit to the Supreme

Court (at paragraph 4 of P21) as well as in her Affidavit to the Committee (at

paragraphs 29 read with 31 -33 of P22).

Despite her claim that she was unaware of the divorce proceedings against her,

there is ample circumstantial evidence which points to the fact that she was aware

of the divorce action;

16

On 26th November 2007, Dharman Jayasinghe and Bandumali Jayasinghe had

entered into a Non-Notarial Agreement (marked as “P4”). It had been described as

a mutually created settlement to divorce/ collaborative divorce agreement.

For the same purpose of dissolving their marriage amicably they had entered into

a second agreement in the style of a post-nuptial agreement, dated 28th December

2007 (marked as “P6”).

In pursuance of the aforesaid agreements Bandumali Jayasinghe had;

• Gifted the premises No. 40/19, Longden Place premises to Dharman

Jayasinghe by Deed No. 3924 dated 28th December 2007. (P7)

• Gifted a land called “Alubogahakumbura” by Deed No. 3932 dated 2nd

January 2008 to Ashan Jayasinghe. (P8)

• Gifted a land along with Dharman Jaysinghe, called “Mahabim Mukalana”

by Deed No. 3925 dated 28th December 2007 to Ashan Jayasinghe. (P9)

• Accepted Rs. 12.5 million as the first instalment of the Rs. 25 million agreed

upon by the parties with a specific condition that the remaining balance of

Rs. 12.5 million shall only be paid when the decree nisi is made absolute.

(Clause 4 of P6)

• Resigned as a Director of Dinu Construction (Pvt) Ltd (Letter of Resignation

dated 4th December 2007 marked as ‘P5 (a)’), a company which was

incorporated in 1987 by Dharman Jayasinghe with co-ownership and co-

directorship with Bandumali Jayasinghe and another

The only explanation she could give to the Committee for signing the

aforementioned agreements was that she was not aware of the nature and

significance of those documents and that she signed whatever documents

Dharman Jayasinghe wanted her to, in order to obtain money for the education of

her son, Ashan Jayasinghe.

From the foregoing, the irresistible conclusion one can draw is that Bandumali

Jayasinghe had ‘lied’ to the Supreme Court with the objective of persuading the

court to take action against Niduk Perera, based on those lies.

17

Following the death of her younger son Ashan Jayasinghe, Bandumali Jayasinghe

in her statement to the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station on 29th January 2011 had

specifically stated that, according to her late son, he had not been pleased with the

food prepared by the ‘Korean Lady’ who was the wife of his father (Dharman

Jayasinghe) and that his father had once warned Ahsan Jayasinghe that the Korean

Lady was not a servant but his lawful wife. However, in her Affidavit to the

Supreme Court dated 27th June 2014, while admitting that she did make a

statement to the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station on 29th January 2011 with

regard to the death of her son, she has claimed that she was unaware that her

husband had divorced her, which certainly was not the truth.

Later, in June 2012, Bandumali Jayasinghe instituted a testamentary case No. DTS-

00134-12 in respect of the estate of the deceased Ashan Jayasinghe in the District

Court of Colombo. In the caption in the said testamentary action she was named

as “Don Bandumali Welikala” and not as “Don Bandumali Jayasinghe”,

“Welikala” being her maiden name. She had also claimed ½ of Ashan Jayasinghe’s

estate, when she could have claimed ¾ of it if her marriage to Dharman Jayasinghe

still subsisted. She did not, however, provide a reasonable explanation for her

abovementioned course of conduct.

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, on 27th June 2012 her lawyers had by way of

motion submitted the decree absolute of her divorce from Dharman Jayasinghe, of

which she denied all knowledge. (page 20 of the proceedings dated 13th September

2014)

Four months after the death of Dharman Jayasinghe, the Condominium Unit

belonging to the late Ashan Jayasinghe was leased out to Colombo International

Container Terminals Limited by Bandumali Jayasinghe and Kim Hee Jung who

acted as joint-lessors and owners of the said property. In the lease agreements

Bandumali Jayasinghe’s status was described as ‘divorced’ and Kim’s was described

as the wife of Dharman Jayasinghe. (Lease Agreement No. 3284 dated 4th July

2012 and Lease Agreement No. 3541 dated 18th June 2013 both dates anterior to

the complaint made against Niduk Perera by Bandumali Jayasinghe)

18

At the inquiry conducted by the Committee, Bandumali Jayasinghe admitted to

signing the said lease agreements (at page 18 of the proceedings dated 3rd August

2014 and at page 13 of the proceedings dated 6th September 2014) however she

insisted that in addition to her it was the mother of Dharman Jayasinghe, Soma

Rupali Jayasinghe (the 2nd Petitioner in the instant case), who had signed and that

Kim Hee Jung had not been present. On the perusal of the agreements, it is clear

that Soma Rupali Jayasinghe had signed only as a witness and that the power of

attorney holder of Kim Hee Jung had signed on her behalf as a joint lessor.

Kim Hee Jung could not have been a joint lessor if she did not inherit Ashan

Jayasinghe’s property through Dharman Jayasinghe. And she could only inherit

from Dharman Jayasinghe if she was his wife.

In addition to all of this evidence, Bandumali Jayasinghe failed to give an adequate

explanation for the telephone calls and email messages between her and Niduk

Perera. When examining the supplementary evidence pertaining to her

knowledge of the said divorce action it is evident that Bandumali Jayasinghe has

not been honest in her representations.

The inference that can be drawn from the above is that Bandumali Jayasinghe

having full knowledge of her dealings with Niduk Perera has made false

representations to the Supreme Court by way of an affidavit, the contents of which

for all intents and purposes ought to be treated as evidence.

The Attorneys-at-Law appearing on behalf of Bandumali Jayasinghe in the present

action have stated that they do not wish to challenge the fact that the allegations

made against Niduk Perera are untrue. Their only contention is that the statements

made do not amount to contempt of court. (written Submissions on behalf of the

Respondent in Contempt No.03/16 dated 21st August 2020)

Thus, at this point this court needs to consider whether the Respondent Bandumali

Jayasinghe’s conduct, namely placing ‘false evidence’ before the Supreme Court,

amounts to contempt of court.

Contempt of Court

Contempt of court is a multifaceted offence, for which it is difficult to lay down a

precise definition. In English Common Law, contempt of court is an act or omission

calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice.

Lord Radcliffe in the case of Reginald Perera v. The King stated;

“There must be involved some act done or writing published calculated to bring a

Court or a Judge of the Court into contempt or to lower his authority or something

calculated to obstruct or interfere- with the due course of justice or the lawful-

process of the Courts.”

According to Lord Cross of Chelsea, “Contempt of court means an interference

with the administration of justice….” Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers

(1973) 2 All ER 54,]

In Attorney-General v. Leveller Magazine Ltd., [1979] AC 440 at page 449, Lord

Diplock defined the offence as follows,

“Although criminal contempt of court may take a variety of forms, they all

share a common characteristic: they involve an interference with the due

administration of justice, either in a particular case or more generally as a

continuing process. It is justice itself that is flouted by contempt of court, not

the individual court or judge who is attempting to administer it.”

In Attorney-General v. Newspaper Publishing PLC [1988] Ch.333, 368; it was held

that, “The law of contempt is based on the broadest principles, namely that the

courts cannot and will not permit interference with the due administration of

justice. Its application is universal.” [per Sir john Donaldson MR]

If the people are to be governed by the rule of law, the judicature administering it

should not only be credible, but should also command the confidence of the public;

without which it loses its ability to perform its functions. The court is required to

adjudicate on the rights of litigants based on the material placed before it in the

form of evidence. Since the court necessarily has to rely on such evidence, the

20

reception of accurate and credible evidence has a significant bearing on the court

arriving at correct decisions.

One of the main reasons, in my view, for almost all jurisdictions world over to visit

instances of giving false evidence with penal sanctions is to ensure the due

administration of justice; for failure on the part of the court to do so would impact

on the credibility of the court and thereby lower the reputation of the court as an

impartial adjudicator of disputes.

Commenting on the principles of the offence of ‘Giving false evidence’ under

Section 191 of the Indian Penal Code, Dr. Sri Hari Singh Gour says “The giving of

false evidence is thus the practicing of fraud upon the court by making it believe

as true that which the deponent does not believe to be true.. As such the offence

belongs the genus of offences concerned with due discharge of their duties by

public servants. The offence is thus a contempt of court…” [Gour’s Penal Law of

India 11th Edition Vol 2-page 1724]

Giving false evidence has received statutory recognition as ‘contempt of court’ in

the form of Section 449 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

hereinafter the CPC] Section 449 of the CPC reads thus;

449 (1); “If any person giving evidence on an subject in open court in any

judicial proceeding under this Code gives, in the opinion of the court before

which the judicial proceeding is held, false evidence within the meaning of

section 188 of the Penal Code, it shall be lawful for the court, if such court

be the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal or High Court, summarily to

sentence such witness as for a contempt of the court to imprisonment either

simple or rigorous for any period not exceeding two years or to fine such

witness in any sum not exceeding one thousand rupees; or…….”

Although Section 449 of the CPC has no application to the instant situation the

point, I wish to make is that, giving or presenting false evidence could be treated

as an instance of ‘contempt of court’.

In the instant case the Respondent had clearly, by misrepresenting facts which

were false or she knew to be false had made use of such facts in her attempt to

obtain from the court the order, she desired.

21

Powers of the Supreme Court to deal with instances of contempt.

The Constitution vests the Superior Courts inter alia, with the power to punish for

contempt of court. The power of the Supreme Court to do so is contained in Article

105 (3) of the Constitution which reads as follows:

Article 105 (3)

“The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of

the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and shall

have all the powers of such court, including the power to punish for

contempt of itself, whether committed in the court itself or elsewhere, with

imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. The power of the

Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any other

court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph 1 (c) of this Article,

whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere.”

In the Matter of D.M.S.B. Dissanayake S.C. Rule, 1/2004, S.C. Minutes of 7th

December 2004 (unreported) S. N. Silva C.J. emphasized that

“…. this Court, as the highest and final superior court of the Republic, forms part

of the administration of justice and necessarily attracts the power to take

cognizance of and punish offences of contempt.”

Hence the jurisdiction to punish as contempt, any act of interference with the

administration of justice is vested with the Supreme Court as a Superior Court of

Record. It is part of the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and an essential

adjunct for safeguarding the rule of rule of law.

Making false representations to the Supreme Court

Judges do not have personal knowledge of the cases brought before them and in

fact, they are not supposed to have such personal knowledge. Therefore, to mete

out justice Judges must depend on documents and the testimonies of individuals

that are submitted to the court. As such, if a document or testimony is false, then

22

there is every likelihood of injustice resulting due to the falsity of the material

before the court.

The plea made by the Petitioners in this action is that Bandumali Jayasinghe has

made a series of false statements to mislead the Supreme Court and has thereby

committed the offence of Contempt of Court punishable under Article 105 (3) of

the Constitution.

The three essential elements required to establish that an individual has given false

evidence can be identified as,

1.The legal obligation to state the truth. (arising out of the binding nature of an

oath, an express provision of law to state the truth, or a formal declaration required

to be made by law.)

2. The making of a false statement.

3. The belief in its falsity.

In the instant case, there are numerous instances that establish without doubt, that

Bandumali Jayasinghe has suppressed facts and has given statements which she

knew or had reason to believe to be untrue. For instance, she vehemently denied

retaining or having ever seen Niduk Perera, but evidence suggests otherwise; she

affirmed to this Court that she never received summons, but on being cross-

examined she admitted that she did; she complained that Niduk Perera had

tendered a forged proxy, but she later admitted that she did in fact sign the proxy;

she claimed to know nothing about Dharman Jayasinghe divorcing her and going

on to marry Kim Hee Jung, but all evidence supports the assumption that she did

know.

The irresistible inference that can be drawn is that Bandumali Jayasinghe has

deliberately presented an account which is demonstrably false, with a view to

mislead and deceive the court to achieve her personal objectives.

When a person misleads the Supreme Court or for that matter any court, it

amounts to interference with the due course of justice by attempting to obstruct

23

the Court from reaching a correct conclusion. (The Secretary, Hailakandi Bar

Association v. State of Assam, A.I.R. 1996 S.C. 1925 at pp. 1930,1931).

Therefore, making false representations to the Supreme Court knowing them to be

false, giving evidence knowing it to be false- and thereby attempting to mislead the

Court amounts to Contempt of Court as it is a direct interference with the

administration of justice.

Despite the fact that Bandumali Jayasinghe was given the opportunity to establish

the veracity of her account, she has failed to do so. The submissions made by her

in support of her allegations against Niduk Perera are laden with contradictions,

inaccuracies and falsehood.

Her assertion that the allegations made by her were not made with the intention of

influencing the court as to the final outcome of the case, but were made in order

to establish the charge against Niduk Perera is not an acceptable justification for

her actions. (A video written submissions of Bandumali Jayasinghe to the Supreme

Court dated 21st August 2020). It is clear that her conduct created a real risk to

the due administration of justice and was therefore a “calculated conduct”.

(Attorney General v. Times Newspapers (1974) AC 273)

Furthermore, the allegations levelled against Niduk Perera which included the

filing of a forged proxy, appearing and filing answer for a party without receiving

instructions, and allowing the action to proceed ex parte, all done without any

instructions from the party purported to be represented, are extremely grave. In

pursuance of these allegations Bandumali Jayasinghe had thought it fit to make a

complaint to the Chief Justice and thereafter tender a false affidavit and

supplementary evidence to support her false allegations. As was reiterated earlier,

In the matter of D.M.S.B. Dissanayake (supra) S.N. Silva C.J. emphasized that the

Supreme Court as the most superior court of the country forms part of the

administration of justice and attracts the power to recognize and punish offences

for contempt.

Therefore, the Supreme Court possesses the power in proceedings relating to

contempt of court, a power which, if properly exercised can be a salutary influence

on the administration of justice. The Constitution itself has vested the Supreme

24

court with the power to hold an individual, who as in this instance, had blatantly

lied to it, guilty of contempt.

Bandumali Jayasinghe has by way of her false representations interfered with the

due administration of justice, by attempting to obstruct the Supreme Court from

reaching a correct conclusion. Her intention has clearly been to deceive and

mislead the Court and her conduct can be described as an attempt to make a

mockery of the law as well as of this Court in her attempt to achieve her personal

objectives. Therefore, it can be held that she calculated conduct to interfere with

and obstruct the due course of justice constitutes contempt of court which is

punishable under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution.

We have considered the submissions made on behalf of the Respondent in this

matter.

Accordingly, we affirm the Rule served on the Respondent; convict the Respondent

of the offence of contempt of Court, punishable under Article 105 (3) of the

Constitution.

In the course of the hearing the Learned President’s Counsel Razik Zarook PC

maintaining the highest traditions of the Bar did submit that “the allegations made

against Niduk Perera had certainly not been well thought of and indeed not correct

and in view of it, the Respondent unreservedly apologise to this Court”.

Upon consideration of all relevant facts the Respondent is sentenced to a term of

two years rigorous imprisonment, however, taking into account the mitigatory

factors pleaded on her behalf, the operation of the sentence is suspended for a

period of five years. In addition, a fine of Rs. 300,000/ [Three hundred thousand]

is also imposed on the Respondent, with a default sentence of two years rigorous

imprisonment. The fine is to be paid on a date to be determined by this court.

The Respondent is further directed to tender a written apology to Attorney -at-Law

Ms. Niduk Perera with regard to the false and /or baseless allegations made against

her.

Although it may not have a direct bearing on the issue before us, I would be failing

in my duty if this court does not make an observation with regard to the discharge

25

of her professional duties by Attorney- at- Law Ms. Niduk Perera. Having gone

through the material placed before us in the course of the inquiry, it was evident

that the Attorney-at Law Ms. Niduk Perera had discharged her professional duties

diligently and in the best interest of the Respondent, Bandumali Jayasinghe and the

allegations made against Ms. Niduk Perera is bereft of any merit whatsoever. It is

indeed unfortunate that the Attorney-at-Law concerned had to face the ignominy

of going through the inquiry held before the Professional Purposes Committee of

the Bar Association as a result of the complaint made by the Respondent Bandumali

Jayasinghe, to the Supreme Court.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

JUSTICE MURDU FERNANDO PC

I agree

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

P Padman Surasena J

I have had the benefit of reading in draft form, the judgment of His Lordship Justice

Buwaneka Aluwihare PC. I agree with the Judgement of His Lordship which

affirms the rule served on the Respondent and convicts the Respondent of the

offence of contempt of court punishable under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution.

26

The Respondent now stands convicted of willfully making the false statements set

out in the Rule which His Lordship Justice Aluwihare PC has dealt with, in detail,

in the judgment.

The Respondent, when the rule was read out to her in Court, had pleaded not

guilty. That was the reason why this Court had to engage in a protracted inquiry

in which the complainant Ms. Niduk Perera Attorney-at-Law also had to give

evidence on several dates. As has been mentioned by His Lordship Justice

Aluwihare PC in his draft judgment, that was in addition to the burden on the

complainant Ms. Niduk Perera having to participate in an inquiry held before the

Professional Purposes Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.

His Lordship Justice Aluwihare PC has held in the Judgment that the Respondent

has deliberately lied to the Supreme Court with a view of moving Court, to take

action, on the basis of her falsehood, against Ms. Niduk Perera Attorney-at-Law.1

The Judgment has further held that the Respondent has failed to give an acceptable

reason for the afore-stated deliberate lie.

It is my view, that the act of the Respondent misrepresenting facts which she knew

were false, and placing such falsehood deliberately before this Court with a view

of attempting to obtain from this Court, an order she had desired, 2 is a very serious

issue. Such acts have serious adverse effects on the due process of administration

of justice by the Court. The Respondent has had no regard whatsoever when she

placed this falsehood before the Apex Court of the land.

In the light of the above circumstances, I impose a sentence of 03 years rigorous

imprisonment on the Respondent. I agree with His Lordship Justice Aluwihare PC

that in addition to the aforesaid sentence of 03 years rigorous imprisonment, a fine

of Rs. 300,000 (Three Hundred Thousand) with a default sentence of two years

rigorous imprisonment be imposed on the Respondent. I also agree with His

Lordship Justice Aluwihare PC that the Respondent must tender a written apology

to Attorney-at-law Ms. Niduk Perera with regard to the false and/or baseless

allegations made against her.

1 Page 16 of the draft judgment. 2 As stated by Hon. Justice Aluwihare PC at page 20 of the draft judgment.

27

I also agree with the last paragraph of His Lordship Justice Aluwihare PC that Ms.

Niduk Perera Attorney-at-Law had discharged her professional duties diligently

and in the best interest of the Respondent.
