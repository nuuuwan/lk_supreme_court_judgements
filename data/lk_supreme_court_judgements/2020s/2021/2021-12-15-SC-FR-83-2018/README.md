Viveka Siriwardena DSG for the Attorney General

Argued on: 16.07.2021

Judgment on: 15.12.2021

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner Sriyanee Dhammika Kumari Semasinghe an officer belonging to Grade II of the Sri Lanka

Foreign Service (hereinafter referred to as SLFS) had complained before this court, the failure by the

Respondents to appoint her to Grade I of the SLFS in violation of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Articles 12 (1) and 14 (1)g of the Constitution. On 04.07.2018 this court granted leave to proceed

on the above alleged violations.

3 As submitted by the Petitioner, she was recruited to the SLFS as an Assistant Director Grade III on or

around 18/04/1996 after an open competitive examination. The Petitioner was placed 3rd on the merit

list.

Thereafter she was posted to several positions in foreign missions as well as in the Foreign Ministry

and at the time she filed the instant application before this court she was attached to the Foreign

Ministry as Acting Director General of the European Union (Bilateral), Russia and other CIS, and the

Caribbean and Counter Terrorism Unit, holding the substantive post of Director Grade II.

Even though the Petitioner was placed No.3 on the merit list, when she was recruited as an Assistant

Director Grade III in the year 1996, (she refers to this as 1996 batch) most of the batchmates in the

1996 batch are now promoted to Grade I of the SLFS and some of them are holding positions as

Ambassadors in various countries. However, the Petitioner was denied of the promotion to Grade II

until 2015 and as revealed before us, in the year 2015 the Petitioner came before the Supreme Court

to secure her promotion to Grade II of SLFS. (SC FR 393/2015)

The said matter before the Supreme Court was concluded when the Petitioner was granted the relief

by the Respondents and the Journal Entry dated 11.08.2016 reveals the outcome on that day as

follows;

The learned Senior State Counsel submits to court that the Petitioner had been granted

the promotion and promoted to Grade II of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service with effect

from 18.04.2006. The learned Senior State Counsel also Submits that the Petitioners

salary had been computed commensurate with the promotion granted to her and also

arrears had been paid.

However, learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submits that some of the

payments had not been paid yet. Learned Presidents Counsel further submits that the

Petitioner is willing to withdraw this application if the foreign Ministry is directed to

ensure her dues are expeditiously paid.

The 4th Respondent is directed to ensure, through the 3rd Respondent, that all dues and

entitlements of the Petitioner are paid expeditiously.

Application to withdrawal is permitted. Application is proforma dismissed.

4 As revealed before us, the main reason for the delay in granting the promotion to the Petitioner at

that stage was the Petitioners failure to fulfill the Efficiency Bar requirements as stipulated in the

service minute of SLFS 2001, and it is relevant at this stage to consider the factual Metrix, for this court

to come to a correct finding.

As already discussed, the Petitioner had joined the SLFS as an Assistant Director Grade III in the year

1996, she was placed No. 3 in the merit list. The said recruitment was based on the SLFS service minute

published in Gazette extraordinary 842/8 dated 25.10.1994 and the said Service Minute had been

revised in 2001 by the Minute published in Gazette extraordinary 1168/17 dated 24.01.2001.

The first promotion to which the Petitioner would be eligible, both under the service minutes published

in 1994 and 2001 was the promotion from Grade III to Grade II and the officer should complete 10

years satisfactory service to become entitled to the said promotion. Therefore, the scheme that was

relevant for the Petitioners first promotion was the minute that was published in 2001.

Clause 7 of the said Service Minute refers to the promotions as follows;

7 promotions

Scheme of promotion;

7.2.I. Promotion form Grade III to Grade II - The criteria for promoting a SLFS officer from Grade III to

Grade II shall be as follows;

(i) The officer should have completed 10 years satisfactory service in Grade III

(ii) The officer should have completed the second Efficiency Bar Examination before

reaching the salary step of Rs. 116,400 and the Third Efficiency Bar, and the

other official and link language requirements before reaching the step of Rs.

135,300 on the Grade III scale.

(iii) The officer should have reached the salary step of Rs. 135,300 on the Grade III

scale.

Even though the Petitioner had completed the first Efficiency Bar Examination as per Chapter III Clause

4 of the 1994 service minute, she was not been able to fulfill the Efficiency Bar requirement by

completing the second Efficiency Bar Examination as per Clause 7:2: I referred to above. Whether the

Petitioner had fulfilled the above requirement was unsolved, even at the time she came before this

5 court in 2015 in SCFR 393/2015, and an appeal submitted by the Petitioner on 30.10.2014 to the 10th

Respondent Secretary Public Service Commission (1R6) and the subsequent correspondence between

the 10th Respondent, 13th Respondent and the Petitioner confirms this position. (1R7, 1R8, 1R9, 1R10,

1R11)

As recorded before the Supreme Court on 11.08.2016, the decision of the Public Service Commission

to promote the Petitioner to Grade II with effect form 18.04.2006 was a result of several decisions, by

the said Commission taken in favour of the Petitioner and if I summarize the reliefs granted to the

Petitioner by the said commission as evinced from the documents referred to above, reads as follows;

1. Extend the grace period from 18.04.2003 to 02.12.2003 (up to the seventh Efficiency Bar since

02.09.1996)

2. Further extend the grace period from 02.12.2003 to 27.04.2007

3. Since the Petitioner could not sit for the Efficiency Bar Examination conducted on 27.04.2007

due to a reason beyond her control and she passed the said examination on the subsequent

examination held on 30.05.2009, to consider that she got through the said examination on

27.04.2007.

Based on the decisions reached above, the Public Service Commission had decided to grant the

promotion of the Petitioner from Grade III to Grade II with effect from 18.06.2006 and the said decision

was officially communicated to the 13th Respondent on 20.05.2016 and was also communicated to the

Supreme Court through the Attorney General on 11.08.2016.

The grievance Petitioner complains before this court in the instant application, refers to the next

promotion the Petitioner was entitled, and in this regard our attention was drawn to Clouse 7.2.2. of

the service minute published in 2001 by the learned Presidents Counsel. The said Clause reads thus;

7.2.2 Promotion from Grade II to Grade I

The criteria for promoting a SLFS officer form Grade II to a vacancy in Grade I will be

that the officer should have completed 6 years satisfactory service in Grade II.

As revealed before us, when the Petitioner was granted the promotion from Grade III to Grade II by

letter dated 20.05.2016, to be operative from 18.04.2006 the Petitioner was qualified to receive the

next promotion under the above Clause, since by that time she had already completed six years

6 satisfactory service in Grade II. In the said circumstances Petitioner wrote to the 13th Respondent to

take steps to grant her the promotion to which she is already entitled.

As further submitted by the Petitioner, by backdating her promotion to Grade II with effect form

18.04.2006, on which day the 1996 batch completed the 10 years satisfactory service, she maintained

the same seniority in her batch and therefore was entitled to be promoted to the next grade

maintaining the same seniority.

The above position maintained by the Petitioner was conveyed to the Respondents by the Petitioner

and the response she received from the Respondents were explained as follows;

a) That by letter dated 11.07.2016, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Petitioner of

adjusting her salary and payments of arrears from 2003 onward (P6a)

b) That in the absence of any positive steps from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with regard to her

promotion which is overdue, wrote to the Secretary, Foreign Affairs on 27.04.2017

c) That the Petitioner had submitted an appeal to the Public Service Commission through

Secretary of Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 18.07.2017, requesting the Commission to grant her

promotion which is pending before the Commission for nearly one year (P-6d)

In paragraphs 6-13 of the said appeal, the Petitioner explains her grievance as follows;

6. Due to administrative lapses, my due promotion from Grade III to Grade II of

the SLFS was delayed for nearly 10 years from the date of such promotion, which

was 18 April 2006. As a result, I was compelled to file the above captioned SC

(FR) application to seek natural justice.

7. That application was settled on 11th August 2016 on the basis that my

promotion to Grade II SLFS be reinstated retroactively on 18 April 2006

without loss of seniority just as the other officers in the SLFS batch of 1996. My

salary too, was to be computed commensurate with the promotion granted to

me with due arrears to be so awarded.

8 Further, the Seniority List of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service needs to reflect the

above retroactive promotion/reinstatement, i.e. I should be reinstated as

number 3 in the seniority list of the SLFS officers recruited in 1996.

7

9. As you are aware, my colleagues in the SLFS batch of 1996, have been promoted

to Grade I with effect from on or around December 2012 (i.e., on successful

completion of six (6) years of satisfactory service vide 7.2.2. of the Sri Lanka

Foreign Service Minute (2001) published in Gazette Extraordinary dated

24.01.2001)

10. SLFS Officers in the 1996 batch are currently serving as Ambassadors/High

Commissioners abroad.

11. To the best of my knowledge, a revised seniority list, as at 5 May 2017 given to

me by the Overseas Administration Division, reflects my seniority as number 1

under SLFS Grade II and not parallel to my batch of 1996 (ANNEX B). Further, I

have been placed at the basic salary of 57,781.00 as at June 2017.

12. I have completed 6 years of the requisite satisfactory service earning increments

up until 18 April 2013 as per sub section 7.2.2. in the SLFS Minute 2001

(promotion from Grade II to Grade I)

13. Therefore, concomitant with the Supreme Court decision and the retroactive

reinstatement of my seniority and promotion to Grade II in the SLFS on 18 April

2006 and given that my promotion to Grade II on 18 April 2006 was delayed due

to administrative lapses (not holding EB exams twice a year as prescribed by SLFS

Minute2001 and failing to forward Grade II promotion appeals addressed to the

PSC by the Ministry) on the part of Ministry, the subsequent promotion to

Grade I on 3 September 2013 after completion of 6 years of satisfactory service

should, therefore, be effected retroactively on the date vacancy became

available, i.e. on 3 September 2013.

d) Even though the Petitioner had not received any response to the appeal, the decision of the

Public Service Commission to the effect tia' ' fla' fiauisxy fukh Y%S ,xld foaY fiajfha

was conveyed to the Petitioner by letter dated 23.08.2017 by the head of her division in the

Foreign Ministry (P6-e)

8

e) Petitioner being dissatisfied with the said decision submitted another appeal on 21.09.2017 to

the Public Service Commission and in the said Appeal the Petitioner re-iterate the following;

e The basis of the current PSC decision (date of promotion as 13th

October 2015) is not clear, as the above date of promotion places

me below two SLFS batches (1996 and 1998, respectively). This

is especially troubling when the Ministry itself had placed me as

number I under Grade II in its revised Seniority List as at

05.05.2017 (Annex E)

f As you may be aware, due to administrative lapses, my due

promotion from Grade III to Grade II of the SLFS was delayed for

nearly 10 years from the date of such promotion, which was 18

April 2006. As a result, I was compelled to file the SC FR

Application No. 393/2015 to seek natural justice.

g The Supreme Court petition was decided on 11 August 2016 my

promotion to Grade II in the SLFS was made effective

retroactively form 18 April 2006 and without loss of seniority on

the basis of relevant provisions of the 2001 SLFS minute. I was

placed number 3 on the merit list at the recruitment to the SLFS

on 18 April 1996.

h Further according to IA of the 2016 SLFS Minute, the new minute

shall substitute without prejudice to any steps taken or

purported to have been taken in terms of the provisions as per

the Sri Lanka Foreign Service Minute Dated 24th January. 2001

of the (Annex F)

I On the same basis as above (g. and h.) my promotion to Grade I

in the SLFS, should also be considered under the 2001 SLFS

Minute and retroactively granted in September 2013 between

the dates 17.05.2013 and 03.09.2013 (date of promotion to

Grade I of number 2 and number 4 on the merit list SLFS 1996)

9

after completion of 6 years of satisfactory service under the 2001

SLFS Minute.

f) That the decision of the Public Service Commission on the said appeal was communicated to

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by letter dated 28.11.2017 (P-8) and the said decision was

conveyed to the Petitioner by the head of her division by his letter dated 05.12.2017 (P-7)

In the new decision the Public Service Commission had ruled that;

g) The Petitioner being dissatisfied with the said decision of the Public Service Commission had

first complained to the Human Rights Commission and later filed the instant application before

this court

h) That by letter dated 12.03.2018 foreign Secretary (13th Respondent) once again wrote to the

Public Service Commission requesting their intervention to find an alternative solution to

resolve the issue of promoting the Petitioner without affecting her seniority, but by the time

the said appeal was submitted, the instant application was pending before this court.

On behalf of the Petitioner, it was argued that the Respondents cannot simply reject the request by

the Petitioner informing that there is no vacancy in Grade I, when in fact there was a vacancy in

Grade I of SLFS on 03.09.2013 and the person who was placed below her on the merit list was granted

promotion on that day. The Petitioners further submitted that the Public Service Commission too had

acknowledged this fact in its letter dated 28.11.2017 (P-8 and 1R4) and therefore the Petitioner was

entitled to be promoted to Grade 1 under the service minute that was issued in the year 2001.

The Petitioner has further submitted that,

the Public Service Commission has an obligation to promote officers on due time in

accordance with the Service Minutes and back date a grade-to-grade promotion where the

10

delay in promotion was due to unavoidable circumstances and due to no fault of the officer

concerned (PSC Rules 184,188)

and argued that the objection by the Department of Management Service to create a

supernumerary post cannot be a reason for the Public Service Commission to neglect its constitutional

obligations.

In this regard the Petitioner relied on the decisions by this court in Chief Inspector W.A.J.H. Fonseka

and Others Vs. Neville Piyadigama and Others, SC (FR) 73/ 2009 SC Minute dated 08.09.2020,

Jayawardena Vs. Dharani Wijethilake [2001] 1 Sri LR 132.

As against the above Position taken up by the Petitioner, the Respondents, whilst raising several

preliminary objections to the maintainability of the instant application, had objected to the grant of

any relief. It was the position of the Respondents, that the Applicant is not entitled to maintain the

instant application for the reason that;

a) The application is filed out time

b) The necessary parties are not before the court

When raising the above objection, the learned Deputy Solicitor General relied on the material

submitted on behalf of the Respondents before this court and therefore it is necessary to first consider

the material placed on behalf of the Respondents. In the said circumstances, I will first consider the

merits of the case and will consider the preliminary objections at appropriate stages.

In his affidavit filed before this court, the 1st Respondent had submitted the following;

a) Recruitment and promotion in the SLFS is governed by the Provisions of the Service Minute of

SLFS and according to the said minute issued on 24.01.2001 it was a requirement for the

Petitioner to have passed the second Efficiency Bar within 7 years of her recruitment i.e. by

18.04.2003

b) Petitioner could not complete the second Efficiency Bar within the stipulated period but

completed it only on 30.05.2009

c) However, the Petitioner was not eligible to be promoted to Grade II when she completed the

second Efficiency Bar, under the Provisions of the Service Minute of SLFS

11

d) The Petitioner made use of a Public Service Commission Circular issued in the year 2014

(Circular 01/2014) to obtain relief in order to complete Efficiency Bar requirement and

submitted an appeal to the Public Service Commission on 30.10.2014

e) In the said appeal the Petitioner admits the lapse on her part in paragraph 3 as follows;

3. I have completed eighteen years (18) and six (6) months in the SLFS as at October

2014. However, my promotion to SLFS Grade II has been delayed due to non-

completion of one subject, Administration and Office Methods, under EB II by

April 2003, the stipulated period from April 1996 for completion of the Second

EB

f) The Petitioner had pleaded for a grace period for completion of her Efficiency Bar requirement

in paragraph 4 as follows;

4. I am appealing for a retroactive grace period for the completion of

Administration and Office Methods, the EB II requirement, on the basis of the

Public Service Commission Circular No. 01/2014 issued on 31 January 2014

g) Whilst considering the above appeal, Public Service Commission had granted several

concessionary reliefs to the Petitioner including

i. Extend the grace period form 18.04.2003 to 02.12.2003

ii. Further extend the grace period form 02.12.2003 to 27.04.2007

iii. To consider that the Petitioner got through EB II on 27.04.2007 when in fact she sat for

the examination on 30.05.2009

and finally granted the promotion to Grade II on 20.05.2016 to be effective form

18.04.2006

h) The other batchmates who completed the Efficiency Bar requirement within the stipulated

period were eligible to be promoted to the next Grade and they were granted promotions

under Clause 7.2.2 when there were vacancies in Grade I

i) When the Petitioner become eligible after receiving several concessionary reliefs from the

Public Service Commission, several of her batchmates including some, who were placed below

her in the original merit list were promoted based on the provisions of the service minute that

was in operation at that time,

j) However, the Petitioner appealed to grant her the next promotion (promotion to Grade I) from

a date between 17.05.2013 and 03.09.2013 in order to maintain her seniority but in the

12

absence of any cadre vacancy in SLFS Grade I, the Public Service Commission could not grant

the said promotion to the Petitioner.

k) The question of creating a supernumerary vacancy retrospectively, was turned down by the

Department of Management Services during a meeting between the Foreign Ministry,

Department of Management Service and Public Service Commission since that was against

Regulation 70 of the Financial Regulations (1R 16)

l) A new service minute was introduced to SLFS on 06.12.2016 and the said Service Minute was

operative from 12.10.2015 (Clause 01)

m) Officers in SLFS were absorbed under the new Service Minute and accordingly the Petitioner

too was absorbed to Grade II of SLFS with effect from 12.10.2015

n) The Public Service Commission had decided to promote the Petitioner to Grade I of SLFS with

effect from 13.10.2015 as per the provisions of the New Service Minute and it is the said

decision the Petitioner had challenged in the instant application claiming that she is entitled to

be promoted with effect from 03.09.2013 and not with effect from 13.10.2015

When considering the position taken up by the 1st Respondent before this court, it is clear that the

Petitioner when submitting an appeal to the Public Service Commission on 30.10.2014 concede that

the delay in promoting her to Grade II was due to non-completion of one subject under

Efficiency Bar II and appealed for a grace period for the completion. The said request had been made

under a Public Service Commission Circular issued in the year 2014. In these circumstances it is clear

that, even though the Public Service Commission had finally granted the promotion to Grade II with

effect from 18.04.2006, question of granting the next promotion was unsolved and the Petitioner was

not considered as a person who has fulfilled the necessary requirements to be promoted to Grade II

of SLFS by the end of year 2014. However, some of her batchmates including the 2nd and the 4th persons

in the merit list were promoted to Grade I, by the beginning of the year 2014, based on the available

vacancies, and by that time the Petitioners promotion to Grade II was not finalized.

In the said circumstances, it is observed that the submission by the Petitioner to the effect that she

maintained her position in the seniority by backdating the promotion to 18.04.2006 cannot be

accepted for the reason that some of her batchmates had already promoted to Grade I when the said

promotion was granted to her.

As already referred to in this judgment, SC FR 393/2015 was concluded before the Supreme Court

when the state informed court that the Petitioners promotion from Grade III to Grade II had been

13 granted to her and therefore the petitioner was permitted to withdraw the said case by court.

However, when the petitioner appealed to the Public Service Commission seeking the promotion to

Grade I, whilst referring to the said case the Petitioner had submitted.

The application was settled on 11th August 2016 on the basis that my promotion to Grade II

SLFS be reinstated retroactively on 18th April 2006 without loss of seniority just as the other

officers in the SLFS batch of 1996. (Appeal dated 18.07.2017 P6D)

Once again, she referred to the said case in her appeal against the decision of the Public Service

Commission which was communicated to her on 23.08.2017 as follows;

The Supreme Court petition was decided on 11th August 2016 and my promotion to Grade II

in the SLFS was made effective retroactively form 18th April 2006 and without loss of seniority

on the basis of relevant provisions of the 2001 SLFS minute. (Appeal dated 21.09.2017 P6-h)

However, the said position taken by the Petitioner cannot be considered as correct, in the absence of

any reference to that effect in the Journal Entry dated 11.08.2016 in SC FR 393/2015.

The Petitioner insisted that her promotion to Grade I should be considered under the Service Minute

that was introduced in the year 2001. However, Clause 7.2.2 which refers to the promotion form

Grade II to Grade I was very specific, that the promotion from Grade II to Grade I can only be effected

if there is a vacancy in Grade I. As submitted by the Respondents before this court, when the Petitioner

was granted the promotion on 20.05.2016 to operate retrospectively from 18.04.2006, and when six

years satisfactory period is calculated since then, she becomes eligible to be promoted to Grade I by

03.09.2013 but, there were no vacancies available in order to grant her premotion under the said

Service Minute.

Public Service Commission in its decision dated 28.11.2017 had admitted this position. Even though

the Petitioner was silent on all efforts by the Public Service Commission as well as the Foreign Ministry

to create a supernumerary vacancy, that too was failed since the Financial Regulation does not permit

to do so.

Even though the Petitioner had repeatedly referred to the fact that there were administrative lapses

on the part of the Public Service Commission in refusing her due promotion, she had failed to establish

a single lapse on the part of the Public Service Commission but as she had admitted in her own appeal

dated 30.10.2014 submitted to the Public Service Commission, that her promotion to SLFS Grade II has

14 been delayed due to the non-completion of one subject, Administration and Office Methods, under

Efficiency Bar II by April 2003 and the said lapse on the part of the Petitioner had created a situation

where the Public Service Commission could not help the Petitioner to grant the Promotion to Grade I

of SLFS for the reasons referred to above.

Petitioners argument that the Department of Management Service had no power to grant final

approval to create new cadre vacancies based on the decision in the case of Chief Inspector W.A.J.H.

Fonseka and others Vs. Neville Piyadigama and others should be looked into in the light of the

decision of this court, in the case of C. W. Mackie & Company Ltd. Vs. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue and others to the effect, ... the equal treatment guaranteed by Article

12 is equal treatment in the performance of a lawful act. Via Article 12, one cannot seek the execution

of any illegal or invalid act. Fundamental to this postulate of equal treatment is that it should be

referable to the exercise of a valid right, founded in law in contradistinction to an illegal right which is

invalid in law. I respectfully agree with what the court said in Venkata Subbiah Shetty Vs. Bangalore

Municipality,

Article 14 (corresponding to our Article 12) cannot be understood as requiring the

authorities to act illegality one case, because they have acted illegality in other cases.

As revealed before us a special meeting was convened to discuss the issue of creating a supernumerary

vacancy in Grade I of the SLFS in order to grant the promotion to the Petitioner between the Foreign

Ministry, Public Service Commission and the Department of Management Service and at the said

meeting it was revealed that the financial Regulation 70 does not permit the Department of

Management Service to recommend creating such vacancy.

In this regard, I would like to consider the relevant provisions in the Financial Regulation which reads

as follows;

Regulation 70 Creation of posts may be done following the procedure laid down in F.R. 71.

No posts shall be created with retrospective effect extended back to lapsed

financial years.

As observed by me, Regulation 71 provides the procedure that should be followed when creating posts,

cadre, scales of salary during a financial year and Regulation 70 does not permit such creation for a

lapsed financial year. Any Government Officer is bound to follow the above Regulation and he cannot

be compelled to violate such Regulation.

15 Petitioners argument that there was a vacancy in Grade I of SLFS as at 03.09.2013 and the vacancy

could have been filled by appointing the Petitioner under 2001 Service Minute maintaining the

seniority, should be looked in the light of the second preliminary objection raised on behalf of the

Respondents.

When raising a preliminary objection, Respondents argued that the Petitioner had failed to add

necessary parties and therefore the application of the Petitioner should be dismissed inlimine.

Requirement of having necessary parties before court was considered by this court under several

jurisdictions of this court and in the case of Don Shelton Hettiarachchi V. Sri Lanka Ports Authority

and Others (2007) 2 SLR 307 question of non-inclusion of all the parties who would be affected in an

application filed under Article 126 was considered by Shirani Bandaranayake J (as she then was) and

held that, It was therefore an essential requirement that the parties, who were necessary to this

application, should have been brought before this court and the Petitioner had not adhered to this

requirement

As already discussed by me, the Petitioners promotion to Grade II was delayed due to non-completion

of one subject under Efficiency Bar II by April 2003, until several concessions were considered under

Public Service Commission Circular issued in 2014. By this time several members of the 1996 batch

including the 2nd and 4th persons in the merit list were promoted to Grade I. In these circumstances it

is clear that there are members in Grade I of the SLFS, who were promoted to Grade I during this

period, when they fulfilled the necessary requirements within the stipulated period under the relevant

Service Minute and their appointments would be affected by the appointment of the Petitioner with

effect from 03.09.2013 as submitted by the Petitioner. In the said circumstances, those who were

promoted to Grade I of SLFS between 03.09.2013 and 13.10.2015 are necessary parties to the instant

application. The Petitioner should have been brought them before this court and had failed to adhere

to this requirement.

Service minute of the SLFS was once again replaced in the year 2016 and the said Service Minute was

to operate from 12.10.2015. All members of the SLFS were to be absorbed under Clause 14 of the new

Service Minute to their respective grades with effect from 12.10.2015, the effective date of the Service

Minute.

16 In the said Service Minute, promotion from Grade II to Grade I was identified under Clause 10.2.1 as

follows;

10.2.1. Requirement to be completed;

i) should have completed at least seven (07) years active and satisfactory service in

Grade II Service category and earned seven (07) salary increments.

ii) Should have passed the second Efficiency Bar examination on the due date.

iii) Should have completed a period of satisfactory service during the preceding five (5)

years from the date of gaining eligibility for promotion.

iv) Should have shown a satisfactory or a higher-level performance during the preceding

seven (7) years of gaining eligibility for promotion.

v) Should have obtained a postgraduate degree in International Relations or an equivalent

qualification form a university recognized by the UGC or an institution, a university

recognized by the UGC as an institution of degree awarding or a foreign university

recognized by the UGC, as per Appendix D.

However, the Transitional Provisions identified under Clause 15.1.2 provides certain exceptions to the

officers belonging to Grade II who were recruited prior to 01.01.2001 (including the Petitioner)

The said exception reads thus;

15.1.2 Promotion from Grade II to Grade I

i) An officer absorbed to Grade II under the provisions of Section 14 of this Minute will

be eligible for promotion to Grade I provided he/she has fulfilled the qualifications

under 10.2.1. of the Service Minute. However, the requirement for the fulfillment of

qualifications under sub section (v) of 10.2.1. will not apply regarding the promotion of

officers recruited before 01.01.2001 from Grade II to Grade I during the transition

period

As revealed before us, the said Service Minute had taken away the Cadre requirement in the previous

Service Minute and the transitional provision had taken away the postgraduate degree requirement

imposed by Clouse 10.2.1 (v)of the new Service Minute,

17 Since the Petitioner had fulfilled all the necessary requirements under the new Service Minute, the

moment she is absorbed under Clause 14 of the new Service Minute, she became entitled to be

promoted to Grade I under the new Service Minute and as submitted by the Respondents before us,

the Public Service Commission had granted the Petitioner the promotion from Grade II to Grade I with

effect from 13.10.2015 acting under the above provisions of the new Service Minute.

The next matter that needs to be looked into by this court is the 1st preliminary objection raised by the

Respondents. When raising a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of the instant

application, the Respondents argued that the application was filed out of time.

As I have already observed in this judgment the Petitioner had come before this court alleging violation

of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and 14 (1)g of the Constitution on

27.02.2018. When complaining the said violations, the Petitioner further moved that,

Declare that the purposed decisions reflected in the letter dated 28.11.2017 (Marked

P-8) as read with letter dated 05.12.2017 (marked as P7) are null and void and no force

or avail in law.

In the said circumstances, it is clear that even though the Petitioner made several representations to

the 1st to 10th and 13th Respondents with regard to her promotion from Grade II to Grade I, she finally

decided to come before this court, when the Public Service Commission informed her that she could

be granted the promotion with effect from 13.10.2015, in absence of a vacancy in Grade I, since the

Department of Management Services had refused to create a vacancy on supernumerary basis with

effect from the said date.

When raising the preliminary objection, the Respondents submitted that the decision conveyed by the

Public Service Commission in P-8 was based on the decision by the Department of Management Service

made in the year 2016. In his decision dated 07.12.2016, Director General Department of Management

Service had informed the 13th Respondent and the Public Service Commission that it is not possible to

create a supernumerary vacancy, back dated to the year 2013 since it is contrary to the provisions of

the Financial Regulations. (1R15)

The Respondents argue that the Petitioner was well aware of this decision since 2016 but, had never

challenged the said decision, but come before this court seeking an order to promote her to Grade 1

with effect from 03.09.2013, in the year 2018 in violation of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

18 However as already referred to by me, the Petitioners grievance was not the refusal by the

Department of Management Service to create a supernumerary vacancy in Grade I with effect from

03.09.2013 but, it was the failure by the Public Service Commission to appoint her to Grade I, to the

vacancy that was available on 03.09.2013, and the subsequent decision by the Public Service

Commission to appoint her to Grade I with effect from 13.10.2015 which was conveyed to her on

28.11.2017.

The Respondents have not challenged the application on the basis that it was filed out of time since

28.11.2017, but it was challenged on the basis that the application is filed out of time since 2016. This

court is not inclined to accept the above argument.

When considering the matters that has been discussed in this judgment, I hold that the petition was

unsuccessful in establishing any violation of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1)

and 14 (1)g of the Constitution.

Application of the petitioner is therefore dismissed but I make no order with regard to the costs.
