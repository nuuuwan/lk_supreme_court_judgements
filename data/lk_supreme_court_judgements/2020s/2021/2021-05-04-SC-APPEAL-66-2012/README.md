Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff instituted this action in June 2000 in the

District Court of Vavuniya seeking a declaration that he is

entitled to possess the land in suit on the strength of the

Permit marked P2 issued in his name under the Land

Development Ordinance, ejectment of the Defendant from the

land on the basis that the Defendant has been in unlawful

possession of it since January 1999, and damages. The

Defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the Plaintiff’s

action. In his answer, the Defendant, whilst admitting that he

came into possession of the land in late 1998, further took up

the position that the land was a state-owned forest land

which he cleared for development. He also avers in the

answer that the land described in the schedule to the plaint

and the land described in the schedule to the answer are

different. After trial, the District Court entered Judgment for

the Plaintiff and on appeal, the High Court affirmed it. This

Court granted leave to appeal against the Judgment of the

High Court on the following two questions of law formulated

by the Plaintiff:

(a) Did the High Court err in law when it failed to

consider the proper onus of proof in this action?

4

(b) Did the High Court err in law when it failed that the

allotment of land described in the schedule to the

plaint and the allotment of land described in the

schedule to the Power of Attorney has not been

identified as one and the same land?

The first question of law quoted above is unclear, and at the

argument, learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant did

not assist the Court to understand it either. However, I

believe I was able to discern its meaning by reading the

Judgment of the District Court along with the written

submissions filed in this Court. Let me explain.

The Defendant raised issue No. 7 on the identification of the

land. It reads as follows: “Are the boundaries of the land

which are described in the schedule to the plaint and the

boundaries of the land which are claimed by the Defendant

one and the same?” The learned District Judge answered this

question in the affirmative.

The land described in the schedule to the plaint and the land

described in the schedule to the Permit are the same. The

Permit was issued in 1990. The Plaintiff claims the land

according to the metes and bounds described in the Permit.

In the schedule to the plaint, the boundaries given are as

follows: North by the land of V. Ponniah and Road; East by

the land of Suppiah Kathiresan; South by the land of R.

Ponnammah; and West by the Path.

The answer of the Defendant was filed in 2001 – eleven years

after the Permit was issued. In the schedule to the answer,

the boundaries given are as follows: North by the land of

Mahadevan; East by the State Forest; South by the land of

Sivarasa; and West by the Neriyakulam Road.

5

It is relevant to bear in mind that the land in question and

the parties to this action are from Vavuniya in the Northern

Province. Many people in this province were displaced due to

the civil war; perhaps as a result, the names of the claimants

of the adjoining lands may have also changed over the years.

It is true that the Plaintiff has not taken out a commission to

identify the land described in the schedule to the plaint.

However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, this

does not go to the root of the Plaintiff’s case. The Permit P2

has been issued by the Land Officer in Vavuniya. At the trial,

the Land Officer was summoned to give evidence on behalf of

both parties. When he was summoned by the Defendant, he

stated in his evidence that the Defendant made an

application to him for a Permit to the land he was in

possession of, and when he checked with the Settlement

Officer and examined the Land Ledger, Alienation Registry

etc., he realised that a Permit had already been issued on the

land. The Land Officer then informed the Defendant of his

findings. The Permit the Land Officer made reference to, was

the Permit issued to the Plaintiff. At that point in time, the

Defendant had not taken up the position that he was

claiming a different land. This means the land described in

the schedule to the Permit (and the plaint) and the land

claimed by the Defendant are the same. The Land Officer

was not cross-examined further on this matter. On this

basis, the identification of the land was established before

Court.

However, the learned District Judge states in his Judgment

that the burden is on the Defendant to prove that the two

lands – the land described in the Permit and the land in the

possession of the Defendant – are different. This finding is

erroneous. The burden is on the Plaintiff to prove that the

6

land the Defendant is in possession of is the same as that

described in the schedule to the plaint. However, no

prejudice was caused thereby to the Defendant as the Plaintiff

had already adduced evidence and the learned District Judge

had already accepted that the land the Defendant is currently

in possession of is the land described in the Permit and the

plaint.

In the Judgment of the High Court, there is no specific

reference to the burden of proof in terms of the identification

of the corpus. The two sets of written submissions filed by

the Defendant before the High Court are available in the brief.

In the said written submissions, the Defendant has not taken

up this issue on the burden of proof. The said written

submissions are largely if not solely dedicated to the defects

in the Plaintiff’s Power of Attorney (as the action was filed by

a Power of Attorney holder). If the Defendant did not take up

such a matter before the High Court, the formulation of the

first question of law in the manner as it stands is misleading.

I answer the first question of law against the Defendant.

However, even if this question was answered in favour of the

Defendant, I would not be inclined to set aside the Judgment

of the High Court on that basis, as I am satisfied the Plaintiff

has discharged his burden in establishing the identity of the

corpus.

Let me now turn to the second question of law. Similar to the

first, this question is also not very clear. I am unable to

comprehend why it was raised. This question suggests that

the land described in the schedule to the plaint and the land

described in the schedule to the Power of Attorney are

different. Perusal of the two reveals this is not so.

7

In fact, even if there was a discrepancy, it would be

immaterial as the Power of Attorney holder has been given the

appropriate authority to deal with the land described in the

Permit. The Permit number and the other relevant

instructions are given in the Power of Attorney itself.

Furthermore, there is no legal requirement to describe the

land by metes and bounds in the Power of Attorney. For the

above reasons, I also answer this question of law against the

Defendant.

There is no merit in this appeal.

I dismiss the appeal with costs.
