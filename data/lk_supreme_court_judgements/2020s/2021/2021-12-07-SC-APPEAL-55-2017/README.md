Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "Appellant") owns four parts of land

containing in total R. 1 P. 9.56. By letter dated 04.01.2016 (P4), he asked the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services of Matale to declare these highlands. Permission was

also sought to grow trees on the earth.

The Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as "Respondent") in a letter dated

24.03.2016 (P11) stated that the said lands are not paddy land. He claimed to do so under

section 28 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended (hereinafter

referred to as Act). In that letter, he sought to impose four conditions that must be met

in order for the land to be used for non-agricultural purposes, namely:

01.

.

02. / .

03. . (

)

04.

.

05.

.

The Appellant sought a writ of certiorari to quash those conditions. It was argued that the

Respondent lacked the power to impose such conditions on the use of non-agricultural

land.

The Court of Appeal refused notice and held that the Act provided the Respondent to

protect both paddy and agricultural land. The Court concluded that the Respondent had

the authority to impose terms and conditions on non-agricultural land use.

4

This Court has granted special leave to appeal on the following question:

Has the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development (Respondent-

Respondent) the legal authority to impose conditions when he declares a land not

to be a paddy land under section 28(1) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of

2000?

The long title of the Act states, among other things, that it is to provide for the utilisation

of agricultural lands in accordance with agricultural policies. It is part of the Act and, as

such, is considered an aid to construction. Moreover, the preamble to the Act elucidates

that it has become necessary to set out the restrictions to be imposed on persons using

agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes in order to ensure maximum utilization of

agricultural land for agricultural production. In Union of India v. Elphinstone Springg and

Weaving Co Ltd & Ors [AIR (2001) Supreme Court 724] the Supreme Court of India held

that a long title along with the preamble is a good guide regarding the object, scope or

purpose of the Act.

Hence, there can be no doubt that part of the object, scope or purpose of the Act is to

provide for the utilization of agricultural lands in accordance with agricultural policies.

That goal is pursued by restricting the use of agricultural land for non-agricultural

purposes.

Part II of the Act is titled utilising agricultural lands in accordance with agricultural

policies. Section 22(1) of the Act plays a pivotal role in the implementation of this object,

scope or purpose by imposing a duty on every owner cultivator or occupier of any

agricultural land who desires to cultivate or manage such land to do so in accordance with

standards of cultivation provided in the Act or any regulation made thereunder. Section

22(2) of the Act provides for the promulgation of regulations prescribing the crops to be

cultivated, the livestock to be reared, the fish to be bred according to the situation and

natural resources of the land, and generally for the efficient management of agricultural

land and for better cultivation.

Accordingly, any restrictions on the cultivation or management of agricultural lands are

sought to be done by the Act by standards of cultivation provided in the Act or regulations

made thereunder.

5

The issue to be considered is whether the Act has additionally vested power in the

Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development to impose other conditions on owner

cultivators or occupier of any agricultural land as to its use. The Court of Appeal concluded

that he had this authority under sections 28 and 29 of the Act.

When interpreting empowering instruments, what is not permitted should be considered

prohibited [Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. ltd. v. Hector Riche (1875) L.R. 653)]. It

is the strict doctrine of ultra vires which was the subject of some refinement later so that

it could be applied in a reasonable manner. Hence whatever may be regarded as incidental

to, or consequential upon, those things which the Legislature has authorized ought not

(unless expressly prohibited) to be held by judicial construction, to be ultra vires

[Attorney-General v. The Great Eastern Railway Co. (1880) 5 A.C. 473].

Upon a careful examination of sections 28 and 29 of the Act, it is clear that they deal with

determining whether a land is a paddy land and the identification of paddy lands which

can be cultivated with paddy and other crops.

In this context, it is necessary to remember that, by definition, rice growing is included in

the meaning of "agriculture" in the Act. Upon a further examination of section 100 of the

Act, it is clear that although all paddy land falls within the meaning of agricultural land,

all agricultural land does not fall within the meaning of paddy land.

Accordingly, I hold that sections 28 and 29 of the Act does not empower the

Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development to impose conditions on owner

cultivators or occupier of any agricultural land as to its use.

Admittedly, section 31(1) of the Act empowers the Commissioner-General of Agrarian

Development or an officer appointed under section 38(2) of the Act to enter upon any

extent of agricultural land to inspect and make inquiries. However, subsection 31(2) of

the Act limits the scope of this inspection and investigation for the purpose of determining

the matters specified in it. None of these matters pertain to the conditions imposed by

the Commissioner General for Agrarian Development on agricultural land use.

6

On the contrary, section 31(3) of the Act empowers such officers to examine any

permission issued under section 32(1) or 33(1) of the Act in order to ascertain whether

the terms and conditions subject to which permission has been issued are being complied

with. These provisions deal with the use of paddy land for purposes other than agricultural

cultivation without the permission of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian

Development and filling up of paddy land or utilizing paddy land for any purpose other

than cultivation.

Accordingly, I hold that the provisions in Part II the Act only makes provision for terms and

conditions to be imposed by the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development on the

use of paddy lands. They do not expressly or implicitly allow him to impose terms and

conditions on agricultural land use.

The learned Presidents Counsel drew our attention to a judgment of the Court of Appeal

in Ranatunge v. Commissioner General of Agrarian Development and Another [C.A. (Writ)

180/2017; 17.07.2019] where I held that the Commissioner-General of Agrarian

Development is not empowered to impose any conditions pursuant to section 28 of the

Act after he decided that the land is not a paddy land. I see no reason to change my

conclusions therein.

Nonetheless, I am mindful of the decision in Peiris v. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(65 N.L.R. 457) where Sansoni J. held that an exercise of a power will be referable to a

jurisdiction which confers validity upon it and not to a jurisdiction under which it will be

nugatory. This principle has been applied even to cases where a Statute which confers no

power has been quoted as authority for a particular act, and there was in force another

Statute which conferred that power.

Therefore, though the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development has purported to

act in terms of Section 28 of the Act in imposing the conditions set out in letter dated

24.03.2016 (P11), the whole Act must be examined to ascertain the true limits of the

powers of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development on imposing terms and

conditions on the use of the agricultural land.

7

In this respect, I note that section 83 of the Act gives the Commissioner General for

Agrarian Development the power to make certain orders. Such orders may take the form

of requiring remedial measures where, amongst other matters, any irrigation channel,

watercourse, bund, bank, reservation tank, dam, tank reach or irrigation reserve is

blocked up, obstructed or encroached upon, damaged or caused to be damaged. This

power is granted to ensure that the cultivation of paddy lands is done in accordance with

the provisions of the Act. Limiting this power to remedial measures following damage runs

counter to the purpose or objective of the Act. Accordingly, I hold that the Commissioner-

General of Agrarian Development has incidental or consequential power in terms of

section 83 of the Act to take preventive measures to stop any of the acts specified therein

from occurring. It includes the power to restrict agricultural land use to prevent any of the

acts specified in section 83 of the Act from occurring.

Accordingly, I answer the question of law in the negative. However, under section 83 of

the Act, the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development has the incidental or

consequential power to take preventive measures to prevent any act specified therein

from occurring. It includes the power to restrict agricultural land use to prevent any act

specified therein from occurring.

I will now examine the conditions imposed by the Respondent by letter dated 24.03.2016

(P11) and its vires in that legal context. Condition 1 seems to be a repeat of the applicable

laws. However, nothing in the Act indicates that the Respondent has powers to monitor

the implementation of these laws. Therefore, condition 1 is ultra vires his powers.

Conditions 2 and 3 are restrictions on the agricultural land use. These are not restrictions

imposed in terms of standards of cultivation provided in the Act or regulations made

thereunder. Neither are they aimed at preventing any of the acts specified in section 83

of the Act. Accordingly, conditions 2 and 3 are ultra vires the powers of the Commissioner-

General of Agrarian Development.

Condition 4 is intended at preventing any obstruction to paddy cultivation and

watercourse. The Commissioner General for Agrarian Development has the incidental or

consequential power under section 83 of the Act to take such preventive measures.

Therefore condition 4 is intra vires his powers.

8

The certificate issued pursuant to section 28 of the Act determines whether the lands are

paddy lands. It does not entail any examination of possession or title. Accordingly,

condition 5 is intra vires the power of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian

Development.

For the reasons set out above, I conclude that conditions 1, 2 and 3 imposed by the

Respondent in a letter dated 24.03.2016 (P11) are ultra vires. None of the other

determinations or conditions are ultra vires.

The Appellant sought a writ of certiorari to quash the decision to impose five conditions

set out in P11. As explained earlier, only conditions 1, 2 and 3 exceed the Respondent's

authority.

In Thames Water Authority v. Elmbridge Borough Council [(1983) 1 Q.B. 570] it was held

that where a local authority had acted in excess of their powers, the court is entitled to

look not only at the document but at the factual situation and, where the excess of the

power was easily identifiable from the valid exercise of power, to give effect to the

document in so far as the exercise of the power had been intra vires. Similar approach

was adopted in Regina v. Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Greater London Council

[(1985) 3 W.L.R. 574] when it was held that in an appropriate case, certiorari will go to

quash an unlawful part of an administrative decision having effect in public law while

leaving the remainder valid.

Such severance of any ultra vires part of a decision is also circumscribed. In Agricultural,

Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board v. Ayelsbury Mushrooms Ltd. [(1972) 1

W.L.R. 190] court held that where the bad can be cleanly severed from the good, the court

will quash the bad part only and leave the good part standing. In R. v. North Hertfordshire

District Council ex parte Cobbold [(1985) 3 AII.E.R. 486] court held that where a specific

part of a licence could be identified as being offensive and therefore unlawful, it could

only be severed from the licence so far as to leave the remainder untainted if the

severance would not alter the essential character or substance of that which remained. It

follows that severance would not be permitted where the words which is sought to sever

were fundamental to the purpose of the whole licence.

9

I hold that conditions 1, 2 and 3 of letter dated 24.03.2016 (P11) can be cleanly severed

from the other valid parts of the document without altering the essential character or

substance of the remainder.

For the reasons set out above, I set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

06.10.2016 and issue a writ of certiorari quashing the conditions 1, 2 and 3 of letter dated

24.03.2016 (P11).

I make no order as to costs.
