Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of Badulla

seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule

to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom and damages.

The defendant filed answer seeking the dismissal of the action.

The mother of the two plaintiffs and the defendant was the owner

of this land. She gifted it to the two plaintiffs in 1968 by the deed

of gift marked P1 at the trial. This deed was not marked subject

to proof. It is on this deed the two plaintiffs claim title to the land.

As crystalised in the issues, the defendant contested the plaintiffs

action on three grounds: (a) the deed is invalid; (b) the defendant

has alienated the land to her sons but they are not parties to the

case; and (c) the land has not been properly identified. Grounds

(b) and (c) were never pursued.

5

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

A deed of gift can be challenged on various grounds: due

execution, fraud, prior registration, non-acceptance etc. Even

though the defendant in her answer and by way of an issue made

a general statement that the deed of gift P1 is invalid, she was

careful not to disclose the basis on which she stated so. In my

view, if it is the contention of the defendant that the deed was

invalid because it was not accepted by the donee, the defendant

must plead it specifically in her answer and raise it as a specific

issue. Merely making a general statement that the deed is invalid

and asking one or two questions about the acceptance of the deed

in the cross examination of the plaintiff is not sufficient at all.

Be that as it may, after trial the District Court dismissed the

plaintiffs action with costs on the basis that the first donee who

is the first plaintiff had not accepted the donation by placing his

signature on the deed and the acceptance of the donation by the

second donee who is the second plaintiff for himself and on behalf

of the first donee who is his brother is not valid. The District

Judge proceeded on the premise that when the donee is a major,

the only mode of acceptance of the donation is the donee signing

the deed himself. Although there was no issue regarding the

acceptance of the donation by the second donee for himself, the

District Judge gave no relief to the second plaintiff either.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the

District Court and dismissed the appeal with costs. Hence this

appeal by the plaintiffs to this court. This court granted leave to

appeal on the following three questions of law:

Have the Court of Appeal and the District Court erred in law not

considering:

6

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

(a) that the deed of gift P1 is legally valid?

(b) that after the donation the first and second plaintiffs

possessed and enjoyed the property from 1968-1982 and

also they rented out and collected rent from the said

property?

(c) that the second plaintiff could accept the gift on behalf of

the first plaintiff who is his own brother?

The general principle is that a donation is a contract and

acceptance of it by the donee is essential to clothe the deed of gift

with validity. There is a natural presumption that every deed of

gift is accepted. The law does not specify a particular form for

acceptance of a deed of gift. The common practice is for the donee

to sign the deed of gift signifying his acceptance. However this

does not mean that the deed of gift is invalid unless the

acceptance appears on the face of the deed. Such acceptance can

be inferred from the circumstances. This includes the conduct of

the doner and donee after the donation. The entering into

possession of the property by the donee leads to the inevitable

inference that the donation was accepted despite the lack of

acceptance on the face of the deed. The question of acceptance of

a donation is a question of fact which needs to be answered on

the unique facts and circumstances of each individual case and

not by simply looking at the deed of gift to ascertain whether the

donee himself has signed the deed. This view is supported by

ample authority including, ironically, all four decisions cited in

the judgment of the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal on the

ground that the first donee has not signed the deed personally. I

will restrict my consideration to those four cases although there

is a plethora of decisions to support the above view.

7

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

The first case cited by the Court of Appeal is Wickremesinghe v.

Wijetunga (1913) 16 NLR 413, in which there was no acceptance

of the gift on the face of the deed, but the District Judge held that

the deed of gift was duly accepted and dismissed the plaintiffs

action. On appeal, the Supreme Court held at 416:

In the present case the evidence shows that there were at

least two distinct acts of acceptance by the first defendant of

the donation in question. It appears that on the wedding day

of the first defendant the plaintiff delivered over to her the

deed of donation, and then she accepted the same. Although,

as I have observed, the delivery of the deed was not

essential to complete the transaction, it has significance here

as a token of acceptance of the gift. Moreover, the first

defendant sold a half of three of the lands gifted to her

husband before the commencement of the present action.

That also was clearly an act of acceptance of the donation.

For these reasons I see no grounds for interfering with the

judgment appealed from, and I would affirm it with costs.

The next case cited was Bindua v. Untty (1910) 13 NLR 259 where

Wood Renton J. (later C.J.) held at 260-261:

It is quite clear that by the Roman-Dutch Law acceptance

may be manifested in any way in which assent may be given

or indicated. In the present case there is evidence showing

that Sinda [the donor] not only permitted his eldest son

Sumara, who was one of the donees, and who was of full

age at the time, to accept the donation on his own behalf and

on that of the minor children, but also that he surrendered

the property in question to the donees after the execution of

the deed of gift; that Sumara possessed the land

8

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

thenceforward, and that his minor brothers and sisters took

the produce themselves on becoming majors; and that they

dealt with the land as owners while Sinda was still alive. I

have examined all the cases that were cited to us in the

argument, but I do not think it is necessary to deal with them

in detail. The question of acceptance is a question of fact, and

each case has to be determined according to its own

circumstances. I would hold that here there is ample

evidence of the acceptance of the donation to satisfy the

requirements of the law in the conduct of Sinda himself at

the time of the donation and subsequent to it, in the

possession of the land by Sumara, a donee and a major, with

Sindas consent, and as Sindas agent, if it is necessary to

hold so much, for the purpose of the acceptance of the

donation, and in the conduct of the minor donees themselves

during Sindas life. It is true that the critical point of time in

such a case as this, where the donation was one taking effect

at once on the execution of the deed, is the date of the

execution of the deed itself. But for the purpose of

determining whether there was such an acceptance, we are

entitled to look not only at the circumstances accompanying,

but also at those subsequent to, the date of the donation.

Taking all the facts of the present case I hold that a sufficient

acceptance of the deed of gift has been established.

The third case cited was the Privy Council decision of

Abeyawardene v. West (1957) 58 NLR 313. The main question in

this case centered round the issue whether the deed of gift in

question created a fideicommissum in favour of a family and the

question of the acceptance of the gift arose for consideration

incidentally. The Privy Council held at 319 that the acceptance

9

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

of the deed of gift on behalf of two minors by their two major

brothers and their brother-in-law is a valid acceptance

notwithstanding they are neither natural nor legal guardians of

the minors.

The last case cited was Chelliah v. Sivasamboo (1971) 75 NLR 193

where Alles J. in a separate judgment reviewed almost all the

seminal decisions in relation to the acceptance of a deed of gift

with particular reference to minors. In this case, a donor had

gifted immovable property to three persons, namely his two sons

and his grandson, who was the son of his deceased daughter. The

three donees were all minors at the time and the donor allowed

his second wife to accept the donation on behalf of the donees.

The acceptor was hence the step mother of two of the donees and

the step grandmother of the third donee. According to the terms

of the deed, the acceptor and the donees were entitled to be in

possession of the property and enjoy its income and produce.

When the donees attained majority, they ratified the acceptance

on their behalf by dealing with the property and reciting the deed

of gift as their source of title. The trial Judge held there was no

valid acceptance of the deed of donation on the ground that the

donors second wife was neither the legal nor natural guardian of

the minor donees and therefore could not have accepted the

donation on their behalf. The Supreme Court held that the

acceptance by the donors second wife on behalf of the minor

donees was valid.

After reviewing the previous decisions, it was held at 211:

Therefore the character of the acceptor is not conclusive on

the question whether there was a valid acceptance or not.

Acceptance depends on the facts of each particular case, and

10

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

when the acceptor was not a natural guardian or a person

appointed by a competent court, acceptance could be

presumed if there were sufficient circumstances for a court

to draw such an inference.

The next question is whether there was a valid acceptance of the

deed of gift P1 by the first donee. At the time of the execution of

the deed, the first donee was not present but the donor, the

second donee, the two attesting witnesses and the notary were all

present. The second donee accepted the gift on behalf of himself

and his brother, the first donee. In the deed it was recorded that

I the said second named donee for myself and for and on behalf

of the first named donee do hereby thankfully and gratefully accept

the above grant and gift hereby made.

The donor mother who lived ten long years after the execution of

this deed did not say that the first donee had not accepted the

donation and therefore the deed was invalid. According to the

evidence of the two donees and one of the attesting witnesses to

the deed who was the donees brother, the mother surrendered

possession of the land together with the house thereon to the two

donees and lived with one of her children until her death. The

two donees have inter alia rented out the house to a school master

for about two years. These items of evidence were never

challenged during the course of cross examination. When this

evidence is considered together with the acceptance of the

donation by the second donee on behalf of himself and the first

donee, there is no doubt that the deed of gift was accepted by both

donees.

The District Court and the Court of Appeal only considered the

absence of the signature of the first donee on the deed of gift to

11

SC/APPEAL/166/2018

conclude that the donation was not accepted by the first donee

and therefore the deed P1 is invalid. That conclusion is erroneous.

There is a valid acceptance of the deed of gift by both donees.

I answer the questions of law upon which leave was granted in

the affirmative and set aside the judgments of the District Court

and the Court of Appeal and allow the appeal with costs. The

District Judge will enter judgment for the plaintiffs as prayed for

in the prayer to the plaint.
