SC/APPEAL/39/2021

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs filed this action against the two defendants

seeking mainly a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint. The 1st and 2nd defendants filed separate

answers seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action. At the

commencement of the trial, two admissions were recorded,

followed by issue Nos. 1-4 raised by the plaintiff, 5-10 raised by

the 1st defendant, and 11-17 raised by the 2nd defendant.

In terms of section 147 of the Civil Procedure Code, learned

counsel for the defendants moved the District Court to try issue

Nos. 5-7 raised on behalf of the 1st defendant as preliminary

questions of law before evidence was recorded. The District

Court after affording an opportunity to file written submissions,

answered these three issues in favour of the defendants and

dismissed the plaintiffs action.

Being aggrieved by this order, the plaintiffs preferred an appeal

to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal by Judgment dated

08.06.2018 held that the District Court erred in law when it

answered the said three issues in favour of the 1st defendant.

However, the Court of Appeal did not stop at that. It went one

step further and ex mero motu decided issue No. 14 raised by the

2nd defendant as a preliminary question of law in favour of the

defendants and dismissed the plaintiffs action. This appeal by

the plaintiffs is against this finding in the Judgment.

This Court granted leave to appeal predominantly on the

question whether the Court of Appeal erred in law when it

proceeded to decide issue No. 14 in the face of issue No. 11

raised by the 2nd defendant.

SC/APPEAL/39/2021

Issue No. 14 reads as follows:

Have the plaintiffs no legal right to institute and maintain

this action in view of section 71(3) of the Finance Act, No.

16 of 1973 and section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance,

No. 18 of 1972?

The position of the 2nd defendant is that the land in suit was

acquired by the 2nd defendant in terms of section 71 of the

Finance Act.

The Court of Appeal answered issue No. 14 in the negative on

the premise that in view of the ouster clause contained in

section 71(3) of the Finance Act, the District Court lacks

jurisdiction to hear this action.

The pivotal argument of learned counsel for the plaintiffs is that

in answering issue No. 14 in the negative, the Court of Appeal

erroneously assumed that the parties were not at variance on

the fact of acquisition of the land. Learned counsel draws the

attention of Court to issue No. 11 by which the 2nd defendant

himself has put this matter in issue. I am impressed by this

argument.

Issue No. 11 reads as follows:

(a) Was the land described in the schedule to the plaint

acquired by the 2nd defendant after conducting an

inquiry on Application No. P.R. 1846 made by the father

of the 1st defendant to the 2nd defendant under Finance

Act 1963?

(b) Was the said acquisition published in the Gazette dated

17.12.1982?

7

SC/APPEAL/39/2021

This seems to me to be the reason why learned counsel for the

2nd defendant did not move the District Court to try issue No. 14

as a preliminary question of law.

In justification of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal, learned

counsel for the 2nd defendant states in the written submission

that by tendering a letter received by the 1st plaintiff marked X,

the plaintiffs by paragraph 8 of the plaint have thereby admitted

or must be deemed to have admitted that they were aware that

the 2nd Respondent bank was claiming that it had acquired the

said property. The fact that the plaintiffs became aware upon

receipt of the letter X that the 2nd defendant was claiming the

property by acquisition cannot be construed to mean that the

plaintiffs admit the fact of acquisition per se. If that was so, it

could have been recorded as an admission at the trial. The fact

that the 2nd defendant himself raised it as an issue goes to prove

that the parties were at variance on this point.

An issue can be tried as a preliminary issue if and only if it can

be disposed of without recording any evidence. A pure question

of law can be tried as a preliminary issue. Nevertheless, when

an issue of law is linked or dependent upon another with which

the parties are at variance, it cannot be tried as a preliminary

question of law.

I answer the questions of law in respect of which leave was

granted in the affirmative.

I set aside the Judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it

deals with issue No. 14 and direct the learned District Judge to

proceed with the trial from where it was stopped. The costs of

this appeal will be costs in the cause.
