Argued on: 07.09.2020 Judgment on: 01.04.2021

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioners-Petitioners before this court (hereinafter referred to as Petitioners) initially went before

the Court of Appeal, seeking the grant of mandates in the nature of Certiorari quashing the decision

of the Council of Legal Education (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent) to admit only 177

students to the Sri Lanka Law College for the academic year 2014 and Mandamus on the 1st

7 Respondent and/or the 2nd Respondent Principal, Sri Lanka Law College and/or the 3rd Respondent

Minister of Justice to increase the intake up to 225 students to the Sri Lanka Law College for the

academic year 2014.

The Court of Appeal by its order dated 17.11.2014, refused to issue notice on the Respondents and

dismissed the Petitioners application.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Court of Appeal, the Petitioners sought special leave from

the Supreme Court. This Court on 28.09.2015 granted Special Leave, on the following questions of

Law;

1. Was the Court of Appeal in error by holding that the Petitioners’ legitimate expectation was

based solely upon the number of students selected on previous years irrespective of merit

based on their performance at the Entrance Examination?

2. Was the Court of Appeal in error in holding that “the paramount consideration be given to

the performance of the candidate than the number of vacancies that exist” when the

Petitioners have obtained 64 and 65 marks which is far above the 40% by Rule 23 (2) (VII)?

3. Was the Court of Appeal in error by not giving sufficient weight to the number of vacancies

that exist or to be decided as a relevant factor when concluding that the Petitioners had no

legitimate expectation?

4. In any event, was the Court of Appeal in error by holding that the Petitioner had no legitimate

expectation?

5. Whether a Writ of Mandamus will lie when a discretion is available to the Public Authority?

As submitted by the Petitioners, they responded to an advertisement published on 05.05.2013

calling for applications for the Entrance Examination to admit students to the Sri Lanka Law

8

College, for the academic year 2014. Accordingly, all of them had sat for the said examination on

06.10.2013, which was conducted by the Commissioner General of Examination.

According to the Petitioners, the results of the said examination was not available until the 1st

Respondent displayed a list of 177 candidates on 25th January 2014, who obtained more than 66

marks at the said examination, as the students who had been selected for the academic year

2014. However, the results of the said examination were published in the internet on 30th January

2014.

The Petitioners who had not scored more than 66 marks but scored 64 or 65 marks at the said

examination, complained against the said decision of the 1st Respondent to declare the cut-off

point for the academic year at 66 marks as an arbitrary decision taken based on factors

unsupported with justifiable reasons.

In this regard the Petitioners have further claimed that there was an average intake of 225

students annually, to the Sri Lanka Law College, and therefore restricting the intake to 177 in the

academic year 2014, was against their legitimate expectation.

Petitioners submitted that the intake for the year 2014 was the lowest intake to the Sri Lanka

Law College since 1981 and in the said circumstances argued that the 1st Respondent’s decision

to deviate its policy by restricting the intake to 177 students without a valid reason, is unfair and

unreasonable.

In support of their contention the Petitioners mainly relied on the statistics with regard to the

intake of students to Sri Lanka Law College for the period 1981-2012, (P-6 and F) and performance

Report published by the Ministry of Justice for the year 2012. (P-10 and L)

9

As revealed before this court, in terms of Section 7 (1) of the Council of Legal Education Ordinance

No. 2 of 1900(as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance), it shall be lawful for the

1st Respondent, Incorporated Council of Legal Education, with the concurrence of the Minister,

to make such by-laws, rules and orders as to it shall seem necessary for defined purposes.

Rule 23 (2) (VII) of the Rules of the 1st Respondent, made under Section 7 of the Ordinance

provided for the selection criteria to the Sri Lanka Law College as;

“Candidates shall be selected for admission to the Sri Lanka Law College in the order

of merit based on their performance at the Entrance Examination and the number of

vacancies are determined by the council. Provided no candidate who has obtained

less than 40 per-centum of the maximum marks shall be selected for admission.”

When considering Rule 23 (2) (VII) referred to above it is clear that the 1st Respondent Council is

vested with the discretion of determining the number of vacancies for each academic year, who seek

admission to the Sri Lanka Law College. Under the above Rule the only limitation to the above

discretion is the restriction on admitting students who obtain less than 40 per-centum of the

maximum mark.

The Petitioners who heavily relied on the documents they produced marked ‘F’ and ‘L’, argued that

as a practice the 1st Respondent selected 225 students to Sri Lanka Law College each year and the

Ministry of Justice had also acknowledged the same by including the said number in their Annual

Performance Report for the year 2012 as the annual intake.

Even if this court considers the statistics provided by the Petitioners with regard to the intake of

students to the Sri Lanka Law College for the period 1981-2012 as accurate, in the absence of any

challenge to the above from the Respondents, it appears that an exact number of 225 students were

10 never selected to the Sri Lanka Law College during these 30 years. As observed by this court it has

varied from 208 students to 701 students, and the said number was decided by the 1st Respondent

using its discretion.

During the arguments before us, the Respondents took up the position that the 1st Respondent is

compelled to consider,

a) Number of students that could be facilitated during the relevant academic year

b) Marks obtained by candidate at the Entrance Examination

when using its discretion in deciding the cut-off mark and the number of students admitted to an

academic year.

Since the competition at this examination is very high, the eligible candidates will have a significant

increase even within one mark. In support of their argument, the Petitioners relied upon a decision

by the 1st Respondent with regard to the student intake for the year 2008. Even though the

Petitioners relied on the said decision to establish that there were instances where the 1st

Respondent had taken more students providing additional facilities, the said decision of the 1st

Respondent had further established;

a) Changing one mark of the cut-off point can increase the student intake by nearly 70 (in the

said instance between 81-82) marks.

b) The maximum student intake cannot go beyond 225

c) If the above limit is exceeded, additional facilities such as lectures in two sessions by

recruiting additional lecturers as well, will have to be arranged.

The Petitioners who had scored 64 and 65 marks at the Entrance Examination for the academic year

2014 complains against the decision of the 1st Respondent to limit of the cut-off mark at 66 and

11 thereby restricting the student intake to 177. However, they are silent whether the 32 Petitioners

before this court are the only eligible group, if the cut-off mark is brought down by two marks, and

if the intake goes beyond 225 by reducing the cut-off mark by two marks as claimed by the

Petitioners, whether the 1st Respondent was in a position to provide additional facilities for the

academic year 2014.

As observed by this court, those are the matters that should have been considered by the 1st

Respondent when deciding the cut-off mark and the number of students admitted to the Sri Lanka

Law College for the particular academic year and as further observed by this court, taking that

decision is within the discretion vested with the 1st Respondent by Rule 23 (2) (VII).

In these circumstances, I will now consider whether the impugned decision to restrict the student

intake to 177 by deciding the cut-off mark as 66 for the academic year 2014 was in violation of the

legitimate expectation of the Petitioners and/or the said decision was an unreasonable decision by

the 1st Respondent.

When considering the argument that the said decision was in violation of the legitimate expectations

of the Petitioners, I am reminded of the following passage from the book titled, Administrative Law

by Wade and Forsyth to the effect, that

“It is not enough that an expectation should exist; it must in addition be legitimate. But how

is it to be determined whether a particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a

difficult area since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be found to

be legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of policy of law.

12

But some points are relatively clear. First of all, for an expectation to be legitimate it must be

founded upon a promise or practice by the public authority that is said to be bound to fulfil

the expectation.”

[Administrative Law H.W.R. WADE and C.F. FORSYTH 10th Edition page 449]

As observed by this court the Petitioners main contention before us was to establish that there was

a practice by the 1st Respondent to admit 225 students to Sri Lanka Law College annually. In the

above context they relied on three documents, the statistics, performance report for the year 2012

and a decision by the 1st Respondent in the year 2008.

However as already observed in this judgment, 225 students (exact number) were never selected in

a particular year but it was varied from 208-701 during the 30 years period the Petitioners relied

upon, but one thing is clear from the council decision in 2008, that the maximum number of students

that can be entertained as a single batch is 225.

The fact that the performance report of the Ministry of Justice for the year 2012 gives the annual

intake to the Sri Lanka Law College as 225 is also a matter that has to be looked into seriously by this

court. Does this indicate the practice or does it gives a promise that every year 225 students will be

taken to the Sri Lanka Law College. There is no dispute before this court that Sri Lanka Law College is

an Institute established through an Act of Parliament as well as an institute comes under the Ministry

of Justice. Even though the Secretary to the Ministry is represented in the 1st Respondent, the 1st

Respondent is governed by the Ordinance under which it was established and the Rules made

thereunder. In these circumstances, a decision taken by the 1st Respondent under a specific rule

cannot be superseded by a mere statement and/or a document made in the pretext of a performance

report.

13 Even if the contents in the said document is considered as correct, that only gives the performance

for the year 2012 and doesn’t go beyond, but it clearly contradicts with the statistics provided, since

the student intake for the year 2011 and 2012 are 238 and 551 respectively.

In the case of Ram Pravesh Singh V. State of Bihar (2206) 8 SCC 381 the doctrine of legitimate

expectation was discussed as follows;

“A legitimate expectation even when made out, does not always entitle the expectant to a

relief. Public Interest, change in policy, conduct of expectant or another valid or bona fide

reasons given by the decision maker, may be sufficient to negate the ‘legitimate expectation.’

The doctrine of legitimate expectation based on established practice (as contrast form

legitimate expectation based on promise) can be invoked only by someone who has dealings

or transactions or negotiations with an authority on which such established practice has a

bearing or by someone who has a recognized legal relationship with the authority and who

has not entered into any transaction or negotiation with the authority , cannot invoke the

doctrine of legitimate expectation, merely on the ground that the authority has a general

obligation to act fairly.”

There is no dispute that the Petitioners before this court were applicants to sit as candidates for an

examination conducted by the Department of Education to select students for Sri Lanka Law College

for the academic year 2014.

The advertisement calling for applications form suitable candidates were called not by the

Department of Examination but by the 1st Respondent. In this context it can be argued that the

petitioners had entered in to a transaction with the 1st Respondent.

14 But can that transaction alone create a legitimate expectation among the applicants to the said

examination when they fail to fulfil the requirements identified in the rules.

In this regard this court is mindful of two issues raised on behalf of the Respondents.

Firstly, the Respondents relied on a declaration made by each of the applicant in the application

itself and argued that due to the declaration made, the Petitioners are not entitled to claim legitimate

expectation with regard to the number of places decided by the 1st Respondent. Petitioners when

submitting their applications, had declared that;

“I am fully aware that if any information given by me herein is found to be incorrect,

false or intended to mislead the Council of Legal Education, I am liable to be

disqualified from sitting the Entrance Examination, and if such information is

discovered after admission, I am liable to be expelled from the college, and I am also

aware that my registration as a student will depend on the results of the Entrance

Examination as approved by the Council of Legal Education and the number of

places available for that year.” (emphasis added)

Secondly the Respondents relied on the decision by the Court of Appeal in the case of Vasana V.

Incorporated Council of Legal Education and Others (2004) 1 Sri LR 154 where Amaratunga (J)

observed;

“When the basic ingredient necessary for the formation of a Legitimate Expectation is marks

over and above the cut-off point is lacking, the Petitioner cannot rely on document which

contains a provisional decision which has been subsequently found to be a decision based on

erroneous factual data submitted to the Law College due to an inadvertent error committed

by an examiner.”

15 In the said case the Court of Appeal held;

I. The legitimate expectation of any candidate sitting for the Law College Entrance

Examination is that if at the examination he scores the minimum mark necessary to

gain admission to the Law College, he would be admitted; accordingly earning the

necessary minimum mark is the foundation on which the legitimate expectation of a

candidate rests.

II. If he fails to get the necessary minimum mark, the legitimate expectation cannot exist

any longer

The Petitioners never challenged making a declaration as referred to above but took up the position

that it was arbitrary and unreasonable to restrict the intake to 177 students by fixing the cut-off mark

at 66 against the long-standing practice of taking 225 students to the Sri Lanka Law College.

However as already observed by me, there isn’t a single batch for the 30 years as referred to by the

Petitioner, which had 225 students but it was varied from 208 to 702.

In these circumstances, it is clear that the 1st Respondent is vested with a wide discretion to decide

the size of the batch and the cut-off mark. The Petitioner making the declaration referred to above

had admitted the wide discretion of the 1st Respondent to decide the number of students to be

admitted to the academic year 2014 by deciding the cut-off mark, which is the “foundation to the

legitimate expectation” as held in Vasana V. Council of Legal Education (supra).

Whilst challenging the 1st Respondent’s decision to decide the cut-off mark as 66 and restricting the

intake for the year 2014 for 177 without going for 225 students as per the practice for the last 30

years, Petitioners further argued that they too have scored 65 and 64 marks at the Entrance

Examination which is far above the minimum threshold identified by rules; i. e. 40 marks and

16 therefore the Petitioners are entitled to be selected to the Sri Lanka Law College on their merit,

alone, but I see no basis for the above argument, since rule 23 (2) (VII) had given the 1st Respondent

the discretion to decide the cut-off mark in order to decide the number of students admitted to the

Sri Lanka Law College in a particular academic year. If the competition is high, the cut-off mark can

rise up and on the other hand if the competition is low, the cut-off mark too will come down but, it

cannot lower beyond 40 per centum of the total mark.

In these circumstances, any candidate who has not obtained the cut-off mark decided by the 1st

Respondent whether it is 66 or 81, is disqualified to gain admission to the Sri Lanka Law College on

his merits and therefore he or she is not entitled to claim his/her right to gain admission on merit.

This court shall now consider whether the impugned decision of the 1st Respondent, when taken

together with all relevant material that was placed before this court, is unreasonable. In considering

so court shall bear in mind the following two passages from Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth;

“The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled with the

no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion of the Public

authority ……...

Decisions which are extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate. But if the decision

is within the confines of reasonableness, it is no part of the courts function to look

further into its merits.”

[H.W.R. Wade C.F. Forsyth Administrative Law 11th Edition page 302]

and the test routinely applied for this purpose, set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses

Limited V. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223. Accordingly, the criteria for review to be

applied would be whether the person vested with the discretion:

17

a) Misdirected himself

b) Failed to take relevant considerations into account

c) Failed to exclude irrelevant considerations

Lord Green in Associated Provincial Picture House Limited V. Wednesbury Corporation (supra)

defined unreasonableness as “something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it

lay within the powers of the authority.”

However, the Petitioners before this court could only show that the intake of students for the

academic year 2014 was 177 as against the student intake within the last 30 years which was

between 208 to 702 and in the performance report of the Ministry of Justice for the year 2012, the

student intake for the Sri Lanka Law College was indicated as 225 which I have considered separately

in my Judgment.

Except for the above reference in the performance report there is no indication of 225 as the student

intake to the Sri Lanka Law College, in any other document submitted before this Court. But Rule 23

(2) (VII) of the Rules made under Section 7 of the Ordinance says “number of vacancies are

determined by the council”

In the said circumstances, it is clear that the impugn decision to select 177 students for the academic

year 2014 by deciding the cut off mark as 66 was within the discretion given to the 1st Respondent

by Rule 23 (VII) of the Rules made under Section 7 of the Ordinance.

Petitioners failed to establish that the said decision violates the legitimate expectation of them

and/or it was an arbitrary/unreasonable decision of the 1st Respondent.

18 For the reasons given in my judgment I answer the 1st to the 4th questions of law raised before this

court, in favour of the Respondents and dismiss this appeal. The merits of the case does not warrant

answering the 5th question of Law that was raised by this court when granting leave in the instant

case. Therefore, I refrain from answering the 5th question raised before this court.

The Appeal is dismissed, No Costs.
