Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action naming the 1st to 3rd Defendants

as parties to partition the land described in the schedule to

the plaint among them on the pedigree set out in the plaint.

The 4th to 10th Defendants were later added as parties. The

4th to 8th Defendants filed a joint statement of claim seeking

to partition the land among those Defendants on a different

pedigree, and also claiming prescriptive title to the land.

After trial, the District Court rejected the 4th to 8th

Defendants’ pedigree and their prescriptive claim and

partitioned the land as prayed for by the Plaintiff. The

revision application filed against this Judgment by the 4th to

8th Defendants was dismissed by the High Court of Civil

6

Appeal. Hence this appeal by the 4th to 8th Defendants

(Appellants).

This Court granted leave to appeal against the Judgment of

the High Court on two questions of law: whether the High

Court failed (a) to investigate title of the parties to the land,

and (b) to consider the prescriptive title of the Appellants.

The High Court dismissed the revision application of the

Appellants on procedural impropriety as well as on its merits.

Let me now consider the nature of the revision application

filed before the High Court and the Judgment of the High

Court thereon.

The Judgment of the District Court was delivered on

22.08.2014. The Appellants did not appeal against the

Judgment as they were statutorily entitled to do if they were

dissatisfied with the Judgment. Instead, they filed a revision

application on 16.03.2015 – about 07 months after the

delivery of the Judgment.

Revision is a discretionary remedy. A party cannot invoke

this extraordinary jurisdiction of the Appellate Court as of

right.

When a right of appeal is available against a Judgment or an

Order, a party seeking to come before Court by way of

revision shall explain in the petition why he did not exercise

his right of appeal.

In the revision application filed before the High Court there

was no such explanation at all.

7

Unlike in an appeal, there is no stipulated time limit within

which a revision application may be filed in Court. The

Petitioner must come to Court within reasonable time from

the date of the impugned Judgment or Order. What

constitutes reasonable time is a question of fact to be

determined on the facts and circumstances of each individual

case. In essence, the party seeking revision shall come to

Court without undue delay. If there is a delay, he shall

explain it in the petition.

However I must hasten to add that if the Judgment or Order

sought to be challenged is palpably wrong, perverse, made

without jurisdiction or suffering from a similar grave

infirmity, the Court shall not dismiss a revision application

on the ground of delay alone.

In the instant case, there was no explanation whatsoever for

the undue delay in filing the revision application.

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a sine qua non

for the invocation of revisionary jurisdiction. Such

exceptional circumstances, albeit briefly, shall be averred in

the petition for the Court to be satisfied on prima facie basis

that notice in the first instance be issued on the

Respondents.

In the instant case, the main ground urged under exceptional

circumstances was the failure of the District Court to identify

the corpus to be partitioned.

This assertion is simply devoid of merit. At the trial, when

the Plaintiff raised the first issue of whether the land to be

partitioned is depicted in the Preliminary Plan, counsel for

the Appellants informed Court that there was no necessity to

8

raise such an issue as the corpus was admitted by the

Appellants. The Appellants, obviously, did not raise an issue

on the identification of the corpus. The 7th Defendant-

Appellant who gave evidence on behalf of all the Appellants in

the District Court admitted the corpus in her evidence.

Having taken up such a clear position in the lower Court, the

Appellants cannot take up a diametrically opposite position in

the Appellate Court. The doctrine of estoppel, and the

doctrine of approbate and reprobate (which is one of the

species of estoppel) forbit this.

The Appellants also stated in the revision application that the

presumption of prescriptive title created in favour of them on

the basis of their long possession had not been rebutted by

the Plaintiff. In my view, the Appellants made this claim in

passing.

By reading the impugned Judgment of the High Court, it is

clear that the Appellants did not pursue this ground at the

argument before the High Court, and the only ground urged

before the High Court was the failure to identify the corpus.

Be that as it may, the Appellants do not in fact affirmatively

state that they proved prescriptive title to the land against the

Plaintiff but instead attempt to shift the burden of disproof

onto the Plaintiff.

I accept that a presumption of ouster can be drawn on long

exclusive possession in the unique facts and circumstances of

a case. (Tillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12 at 24) But

the well-established general principle is that the burden of

proof of prescriptive title (as against the party who is able to

9

point to a paper title) rests fairly and squarely upon the party

who asserts such prescriptive title.

The Appellants must understand that what was filed before

the High Court was not a final appeal but a revision

application and they cannot clutch at straws for survival.

The purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is to promote the due

administration of justice and correct miscarriage of justice.

But it is well to remember that unlike in an appeal, not every

error of fact or law may be corrected in revision. In short, the

general ground that the Judgment is incorrect, which is

sufficient to invoke the statutory right of appeal, does not per

se constitute an exceptional ground to invoke the

extraordinary jurisdiction of revision. The error complained

of shall shock the conscience of the Court.

In a revision application, unlike in a statutory right of appeal,

there is a threshold or vetting process before the applicant is

afforded a full hearing.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is my

considered view that the revision application should have

been dismissed in limine without notice being issued on the

Respondents.

The High Court, having taken the view that the Petitioner did

not pass the gateway, nevertheless considered the merits of

the application notably on the limited ground urged, i.e.

failure to identify the corpus, before it dismissed the

application.

The Judgment of the High Court is flawless.

10

Let me now consider the appeal before this Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellants stated at the argument

that he confines his argument only to the question of

prescription.

As I have already stated, in my view, the Appellants did not

vigorously pursue the plea of prescriptive title before the High

Court. Therefore the High Court did not consider it. Hence

the Appellants cannot complain that the High Court failed to

consider their prescriptive title to the land, and therefore this

Court shall now consider it and allow the appeal.

What is before this Court is not a revision application but a

final appeal. The Appellants have come before this Court not

against the Judgment of the District Court but against the

Judgment of the High Court.

Nonetheless, as this is the final Court, I thought I must

consider the Appellants’ plea of prescriptive title.

At the trial, the Plaintiff’s father gave evidence on behalf of

the Plaintiff and produced deeds and documents from the

Land Registry marked P1-P4 and 1V1. He also marked the

Preliminary Plan and the Report as X and X1, respectively.

The 7th Defendant-Appellant gave evidence on behalf of the

Appellants. In her evidence, she only marked the Death

Certificate of her mother, which is an admitted fact.

According to the Plaintiff’s pedigree:

The original owner of the land is Jamis Samarawickrama. By

deed No. 11825 dated 28.02.1933, he alienated this property

to his daughter Emalia Samarawickrama. The fact that this

11

deed was registered at the Land Registry and is now

destroyed is established by P1 issued by the Land Registry.

Emalia Samarawickrama was the elder sister of Dinoris

Samarawickrama who was the Plaintiff’s grandfather. Emalia

Samarawickrama gifted this land together with several other

lands by deed No. 1588 dated 19.03.1967 marked P2 to

Dayaratne Jinadasa and Nandawathie Jinadasa who are her

two children, and to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants who are her

grandchildren, in the proportion of 1/3 share each to her two

children and the balance 1/3 share equally to her two

grandchildren. Dayaratne Jinadasa married Rupa Jinadasa

and his 1/3 share devolved on their children Lakkhi

Jinadasa, Omala Jinadasa and Tissanath Jinadasa.

Thereafter, by deed No. 1532 dated 27.02.2001 marked P3,

they donated this 1/3 share to the Plaintiff. The aforesaid

Nandawathie Jinadasa transferred her 1/3 share by deed No.

201 dated 18.01.1991 marked 1V1 to the 1st Defendant. The

Land Registry extracts relevant to these transactions were

marked P4. According to the Plaintiff’s pedigree, the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant are each entitled to 2/6 share, and the

2nd and 3rd Defendants are each entitled to 1/6 share.

The learned District Judge accepted this pedigree.

Conversely, the Appellants unfolded a different pedigree but

did not mark any deeds in evidence. Deeds executed after the

lis pendens was registered were not marked.

According to the Appellants’ pedigree as described in the

evidence of the 7th Defendant-Appellant:

The original owner of the land is Thiloris Samarawickrama

who is the younger brother of Jamis Samarawickrema (the

12

original owner of the land according to the pedigree of the

Plaintiff). Thiloris Samarawickrama had four children and

one of them is the 7th Defendant-Appellant’s father Jinoris

Samarawickrema who married Angurukankanamlage Upona.

After the death of Jinoris Samarawickrema and

Angurukankanamlage Upona, the entire land devolved on

their five children, the 4th to 8th Defendant-Appellants.

This pedigree was not accepted by the learned District Judge

and the Appellants do not canvass it before this Court.

The 7th Defendant-Appellant admits in her evidence that

Jamis Samarawickrema and Thiloris Samarawickrema were

brothers, and her father Jinoris Samarawickrema was the

son of Thiloris Samarawickrema; and that Emalia

Samarawickrema (who executed the deed P2) was the

daughter of Jamis Samarawickrema; and that Emalia

Samarawickrema and Jinoris Samarawickrema had been on

good terms throughout their lives as cousins.

On this basis, it is the submission of learned counsel for the

Plaintiff that Emalia Samarawickrema, admittedly an affluent

lady who had gifted 71 parcels of land by deed P2, allowed

Thiloris Samarawickrema to possess the land that is the

subject matter of this action.

The 7th Defendant-Appellant states that her father Jinoris

Samarawickrema and her grandfather Thiloris

Samarawickrema both lived on this land, the 4th to 8th

Defendant-Appellants were born on this land, and there are

three houses on the land where she, the 4th Defendant-

Appellant and his son are living. The Plaintiff’s father admits

these facts in his evidence.

13

The 7th Defendant-Appellant has not seen her grandfather

Thiloris Samarawickrema and says she does not know how

her grandfather and father came into possession of the land.

She does not dispute the Plaintiff’s deeds but says she was

unaware of those deeds and further says neither the Plaintiff

nor anybody in the Plaintiff’s pedigree ever possessed the

land.

It is not possible to believe that the Appellants did not at least

know that Emaliya Samarawickrema was the owner of the

land at one point in time. The Appellants cannot say that

their grandfather came to a no-man’s-land. The Appellants

shall explain how they came into possession of someone else’s

land.

In Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR 365 at 371, G.P.S. De

Silva C.J. stated that a facile story of walking into abandoned

premises after the Japanese air raid constitutes material far

too slender to found a claim based on prescriptive title.

The only submission of learned counsel for the Appellants is

that the Appellants and their predecessors have been in

physical possession of the land since 1948. But long

possession alone does not amount to prescriptive possession.

In order to claim prescriptive title under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance, possession for over ten years is only

one requirement. Such possession shall not only be

“undisturbed and uninterrupted”, but also, more importantly,

“by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or

plaintiff”. The possession shall be of a character incompatible

with the title of the true owner.

14

The commencement of prescriptive possession can coincide

with the commencement of possession itself if the possessor

enters the land in a capacity inconsistent with the owner’s

title. If not, the possessor shall signify the change in the

character of possession by an overt act or a series of acts

indicative of a challenge to the owner’s title. The prescriptive

period begins to run only from that point and not from the

date of entry to the land. (Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR

365, Reginald Fernando v. Pabilinahamy [2005] 1 Sri LR 31 at

37, Chelliah Vs. Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR 337 at 342,

Mitrapala v. Tikonis Singho [2005] 1 Sri LR 206 at 211-212)

Where the relationship between the two parties is very close

such as in the instant case, the proof of change in the

character of possession from innocuous to adverse is greater

than in a case where the two parties are total outsiders. (De

Silva v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 80 NLR 292,

Podihamy v. Elaris [1988] 2 Sri LR 129)

In the instant case, the Appellants have failed to prove that

they commenced adverse possession from the outset or that

they changed their character of possession subsequently.

The evidence of the 7th Defendant-Appellant is that the

Appellants continued their possession without any objection

from the Plaintiff or the other co-owners. This is not

sufficient to claim prescriptive tittle.

In the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned

District Judge cannot be found fault with for rejecting the

prescriptive claim of the Appellants.

I answer the questions of law in respect of which leave was

granted in the negative.
