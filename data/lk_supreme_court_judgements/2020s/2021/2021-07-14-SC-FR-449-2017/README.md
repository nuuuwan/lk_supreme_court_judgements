The Petitioner is the wife of Chadik Shyaman Wickramarachchi who is alleged to have died

while in Police custody. Chadik Shyaman is a father of two children, a seven-year-old son and

a daughter of one month at the time of his death. The Petitioner and her husband Chadik

Shyaman were living with the Petitioners father, her mother, two of her aforesaid children at

Mihinsha, 259/1/2B, Rassapana Road, Ihala Bombiriya, Kaduwela since year 2000 as their

permanent residence.

Around 4.00 am on 25-02-2017 the 1st to 5th Respondents had come to their residence,

arrested said Chadik Shyaman and taken him to Peliyagoda Police Station. The Petitioner who

was also present at the time of the said arrest, had identified the 1st to 5th Respondents as

police officers who had come from Peliyagoda Police Station. According to the Petitioner,

Chadik Shyaman was clad in a blue short and a green shirt, when he left home on that day

with the 1st to 5th Respondents. When inquired as to the reasons for taking him to the police

station the 1st to 5th Respondents had stated that they wanted to record a statement from

Chadik Shyaman.

Around 9.00 am on 25-02-2017, the Petitioner had gone to her husbands house in order to

visit Peliyagoda Police Station. It was at that time she was informed that her husband had

died and the body was lying at the Colombo General Hospital.

The Petitioner, her husbands father and a friend Wasanath had then gone to Sapugaskanda

Police Station from where they were taken to Peliyagoda Police Station around 11.20 am on

25-02-2017. There, one high ranking police officer had explained to the Petitioner; that Chadik

Shyaman was arrested in connection with a robbery of a car and jewelry in Kelaniya and

Bandarawatte; that her husband had fallen sick, suffering from a wheezing attack when his

statement was recorded; and that he was admitted to the hospital. The Petitioner states that

this briefing is manifestly false in view of the findings in the postmortem report. The Petitioner

has complained that the 1st to 5th Respondents had taken her husband into custody only to

be killed when under the police custody.

It is in this backdrop that the Petitioner has prayed inter alia for the following relief.

a. Declare that the action of the 1st to 5th Respondents have violated her husbands

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12 (1), 13 (1), 13 (2) and 13 (3) of

the Constitution, and subsequently the Petitioner and her two children have been

victimized due to such violations;

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 4 of 10

b. Order the Hon. Attorney General to indict the 1st to 5th Respondents in the High Court

for the offence of causing torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment

punishable under Act No. 22 of 1994;

c. Order the Registrar of the Supreme Court to call for a progress report from the

Chairman of the National Police Commission of Sri Lanka regarding the investigation

carried out on the complaint made by the Petitioner;

d. Grant compensation of Rs. 50,000,000 (Rupees Fifty Million) for the Petitioner for the

violation of her husbands fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12 (1), 13

(1), 13 (2) and 13 (3) of the Constitution.

This Court on 10-01-2019, having heard the submissions of the learned counsel for the

Petitioner and the submissions of the learned counsel for the Respondents, had granted leave

to proceed only in respect of the alleged violations of Articles 11 and 12(1) of the Constitution

against the 1st to 5th Respondents.

It would be opportune at the outset, to turn to the position taken up by the Hon. Attorney

General in this case. The Hon. Attorney General has informed Court that a disciplinary action

was initiated against the 1st to 5th Respondents by the Senior Superintendent of Police

Gunathileka upon the directions of the Senior Deputy Inspector General Western Province

(Crimes and Traffic). Upon the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, a charge sheet was

served on the 1st to 5th Respondents in order to conduct a formal disciplinary inquiry against

them.

In addition to the aforesaid formal disciplinary inquiry, an Assistant Superintendent of Police

on the instructions of Superintendent of Police Kelaniya, had conducted investigations

pertaining to the death of the husband of the Petitioner in police custody. Upon the conclusion

of the said investigation, the police had forwarded the relevant material pertaining to the said

investigation to the Hon. Attorney General who had directed to file charges against the 1st to

5th Respondents for an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code and conduct

a non-summary inquiry in the relevant Magistrates Court. After the conclusion of the said non

summary inquiry, the case was again referred to the Hon. Attorney General who thereafter

having considered the available material had taken steps to indict the 1st to 5th Respondents

under section 2(4) of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman, Degrading

Treatment or Punishment Act No. 22 of 1994 in the High Court of Colombo. The High Court

of Colombo has reportedly fixed this case (case No. HC 155/2019) for trial.

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 5 of 10

At the time of the argument the learned counsel for the Petitioner in view of the actions taken

by the state to indict the 1st to 5th Respondents, did not press for the afore-said relief prayed

under (c) and (d). Indeed, I am satisfied that the Petitioner has already received relief she

had expected from those two prayers. Therefore, I would not focus on the said prayers in this

judgment.

The 1st to 5th Respondents have filed a joint affidavit and a statement of objections. The 1st

to 5th Respondents have admitted that police officers attached to Peliyagoda Police Station

had gone and arrested the Petitioners husband on 25-02-2017 in respect of an incident of

committing a robbery of a vehicle using a firearm with another suspect named Isuru

Sandaruwan. The 1st to 5th Respondents have also stated that there was no necessity to break

open any door as alleged by the Petitioner as an old person in the house opened the door to

enable the arrest of the Petitioners husband. The 1st to 5th Respondents also state that the

family members of Chadik Shyaman and his wife (the Petitioner) were also there at the time

of arrest who had informed that Chadik Shyaman was frequently suffering from wheeze. They

further state that the family members also gave an inhaler along with some capsules and

medicine to Chadik Shyaman who inhaled from the inhaler and also took one capsule just

after his arrest. Although not specifically admitted that they arrested the Petitioners husband,

it can be reasonably inferred from several averments in the joint affidavit filed by the 1st to 5th

Respondents that they were the members of the team of police officers responsible for the

arrest and bringing Chadik Shyaman to Peliyagoda Police Station. They have not denied that

they were the members of the said team. It must be borne in mind that this Court had not

granted leave for the Petitioner to proceed with infringements under Article 13(1) of the

Constitution. Therefore, I would not venture into consider the legality of the arrest of the

Petitioners husband.

The 1st to 5th Respondents had not taken up a position in their affidavit that they had handed

over the Petitioners husband to the police station or to any other officer after his arrest. If

the 1st to 5th Respondents had handed over the Petitioners husband to any other police officer,

it is the 1st to 5th Respondents who should have known it best. Thus, in the absence of such

position being taken up by the 1st to 5th Respondents, I would henceforth proceed on the basis

that the Petitioners husband continued to be in the custody of the 1st to 5th Respondents until

the occurrence of the events which led to his death.

It is the position of the 1st to 5th Respondents that the Petitioners husband is a person who

was suffering from wheeze, fell ill due to that illness and was admitted to the hospital later

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 6 of 10

on. However, they have failed to produce copies of any note containing any entry made in

that regard, in any of the Information Books maintained at the relevant Police Station.

Although the 1st to 5th Respondents have denied assaulting the Petitioners husband, all what

they have stated in their affidavit and the statement of objections is that; the Petitioners

husband was arrested; a statement was recorded; he fell ill; he was admitted to the hospital;

and he died.

A postmortem examination of the body of the Petitioners husband had been conducted at

10.00 am on 26-02-2017 by the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer - Colombo. The Consultant

Judicial Medical Officer had observed twenty-eight external injuries on the body of the

Petitioners husband. The Petitioner has produced the aforementioned Post Mortem Report

marked P-7. The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer had set out the said external injuries in

the said Post Mortem Report in the following manner under the heading signs of recent injury.

SIGNS OF RECENT INJURY

1. There is a 0.5 cm faint abrasion in the left frontal eminence area.

2. There is a 0.5 cm faint abrasion in the left forehead which is situated 1 cm above the

lateral end of the left eyebrow.

3. There is a 2x1 cm abraded contusion in the left malar eminence area.

4. There are retrain marks with an imprint abrasion along with contusions similar to hand

cuffs in both wrist areas.

5. There is a 4 cm obliquely oriented scratch abrasion above the manubrium sternum

area.

6. There is a 3 cm obliquely oriented scratch abrasion in the medial end of the right

clavicle.

7. There is a 1 cm abrasion in the posterior aspect of the right forearm situated 6 cm

below the right elbow.

8. There is a 2x1 cm abrasion in the lateral aspect of the right elbow area.

9. There is a 5x4 cm purple contusion in the palmer aspect of the right hand.

10. There are two focal abrasions in the left anterior shin (0.5 cm each). One is placed in

the upper third and the other in the mid third of the left shin.

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 7 of 10

11. There is a 2.5 x 1 cm abrasion in the lateral aspect of the right knee.

12. There is a 1 cm abraded contusion in the upper third of the right anterior shin.

13. There is a pre cervical vertebral haemorrhage with a 4th to 5th cervical spine fracture.

The following injuries were seen after reflection of the skin. They are not isolated

injuries but described as groups for easy reference. Therefore, the numbering of

them does not accurately reflect the exact number of injuries.

14. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions in the entire posterior aspect

of the left forearm. There are overlapping tram line contusions within the diffuse

contusion. There is a 2x1 cm focal abrasion on the skin in the upper third of the

posterior aspect of the left forearm.

15. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions extending from the top of the

left shoulder to the left elbow diffusely distributed in the postero-lateral aspect. There

are overlapping tram line contusions within the diffuse contusion.

16. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions extending from the tip of the

right shoulder towards the posterior middle third of the right upper arm.

17. There are contusions of the dorsal aspect of the right hand.

18. There are contusions of the dorsal aspect of the left hand.

19. There are contusions of the palmar aspect of the right hand.

20. There are contusions of the palmar aspect of the right.

21. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions extending from the lateral

aspect of the left hip which extends downwards in an area of 25x30 cm which also

extend anteriorly and posteriorly. There are overlapping tram line contusions within

the diffuse contusions. The left inguinal area and just below it is spared.

22. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions extending from the lateral

aspect of the right upper thigh which extends downwards in an area of 30x35 cm

which extends anteriorly and posteriorly. There are overlapping tram line contusions

within the diffuse contusion.

23. There are contusions of the right calf area.

24. There are contusions of the left calf area.

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 8 of 10

25. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions in the entire back of the torso

spearing the recessed areas of the back of the chest horizontally along the mid line

and lumbar area. There are overlapping multiple tram line contusions within the diffuse

contusions. The left inguinal area is overlapping multiple tram line contusions within

the diffuse contusions. The left inguinal area and just below it is spared. The exact

length of the tram line contusions cannot be measured due to their overlap. The width

of tram line contusions measure about 4.5 cm (with central pallor of 1.5 cm and

marginal contusions of 1.5 cm each=4.5 cm).

26. There are diffuse and extensive deep muscle contusions in the entire gluteal regions.

They extend up to the lower third of the back of both thigh areas.

27. There is a faint 4.5x10 cm somewhat horizontally oriented soft tissue contusion in the

exterior abdomen just below the level of the umbilicus.

28. There are contusions of the sole of both feet.

The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer has described these injuries as signs of recent injuries

and identified the injury pattern as one commonly seen in torture. According to the Post

Mortem Report, the cause of death is Hypovolemia due to multiple defuse and extensive

muscle and soft tissue contusions caused by blunt force trauma on the body.

Further, the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer had observed sand on the head, head hair,

neck and torso of the body of the Petitioners husband. This supports the averment in the

petition in which the Petitioner has stated that she identified her husbands body; the body

was without a shirt on it; and she had observed sand on her husbands body. It must be

remembered that the 1st to 5th Respondents have stated that there was no necessity to break

open any door as an old person in the house opened the door to facilitate the arrest of the

Petitioners husband. The 1st to 5th Respondents do not take up any position even to suggest

any instance of any resistance by the Petitioners husband or any attempt to escape from

custody or any struggle with any other during the period in their custody since his arrest at

about 4.00 am in the morning of 25-02-2017. Indeed, the Petitioners husband had been in

the custody of the 1st to 5th Respondents only for few hours as the Post Mortem Report

indicates that the death had occurred at 9.06 am on 25-02-2017. The said time duration could

be estimated to be approximately 05 hours. As per the 1st to 5th Respondents position, the

said five hours would include the time during which the Petitioners husband fell ill due to

wheezing attack. The position of the Petitioner in this regard is also compatible with this

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 9 of 10

finding as she has stated in her petition that it was around 9.00 am on 25-02-2017 that she

was informed that her husband had died and the body was lying at Colombo General Hospital.

The next question is as to how the Petitioners husband who was in the custody of the 1st to

5th Respondents could have sustained these injuries. All what the Petitioner knew about this

and in fact has stated in the petition is the fact of the arrest of her husband; him being taken

to Peliyagoda Police Station; his death while in police custody; and thereafter seeing his body

in the hospital.

One would not need more evidence than the above list of external injuries on the body of the

Petitioners husband along with the opinion of the consultant Judicial Medical Officer to

conclude that somebody had used blunt force trauma on the Petitioners husband. The 1st to

5th Respondents were obliged in law to keep the Petitioners husband in their safe custody as

long as they kept him in their custody as a suspect pending further investigations. The 1st to

5th Respondents have not explained as to how the Petitioners husband who was in their

custody had sustained not one or two but twenty-eight injuries listed above. Thus, in the

absence of any explanation by the 1st to 5th Respondents, the only irresistible conclusion is

that the 1st to 5th Respondents had used blunt force trauma on the Petitioners husband while

in their custody after his arrest and that had brought him a considerable number of injuries

on his body. There is no other inference possible in the above circumstances. As regards the

death, it is clear from the findings of the Post Mortem Examination, that the Petitioners

husbands death was not due to a wheezing attack. Nor have the 1st to 5th Respondents

established that he was admitted to the hospital on that sickness. The Post Mortem Report is

clear that the cause of death is due to extensive muscle and soft tissue contusions caused by

blunt force trauma.

In the case of Sriyani Silva Vs. Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Paiyagala and

others,1 His Lordship Justice Mark Fernando, held that Article 13(4) impliedly recognized the

right to life at least in the sense of mere existence, as distinct from the quality of life which

can only be deprived of, by a court order and that Article 11 (read with Article 13(4)),

recognizes a right not to deprive a citizen of his life whether by way of punishment or

otherwise. His Lordship went on to hold that the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution on

this Court for the sole purpose of protecting fundamental rights against executive action must

be deemed to have conferred all that is reasonably necessary for this Court to protect the said

rights effectively.

1 2003 (2) SLR 63.

(SC FR 449/2017) - Page 10 of 10

Moreover, Justice Mark Fernando in that case, also held that the lawful heirs and/or

dependents are entitled to institute proceedings under Article 126(2) read with Article 17 in

respect of the infringement of the afore-said fundamental rights.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, I hold that the 1st to 5th Respondents

have infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioners husband Chadik Shyaman

Wickramarachchi guaranteed under Article 11 and 12(1) of the Constitution.

I award a sum of Rs 1,000,000, as compensation, of which a sum of Rs 750,000 shall be paid

by the State and Rs 50,000 each by the 1st to 5th Respondents personally. The amount of

money ordered as compensation must be paid within four months from the date of the

pronouncement of this judgment.

Out of the sum of Rs. 1,000,000/= (one Million) awarded as compensation, a sum of Rs.

500,000/= shall be invested in the names of the two children in equal shares in a state bank.

The Petitioner is entitled to the balance Rs. 500,000/= The Registrar must ensure the

distribution/investment of compensation ordered.
