A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner was working in the Chief Secretarys office under the Director (Planning)

and the Deputy Chief Secretary, (Planning) of the Western Provincial Council. In the

Amended Petition dated 01/10/2016, the Petitioner claims that he was released from the

Western Provincial Council and assigned duties in the Ministry of Primary Industries by

the Ministry of Finance and Planning by its impugned decision as reflected in document

marked P11, which the Petitioner claims was in violation of his fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. Leave to proceed was

granted on 15/11/2017, on the alleged infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The facts of the case as established by the pleadings and the documents therein are set out

as follows.

The Petitioner was appointed to Grade II class II in the Planning Service and was posted

to the Provincial Council of the Western Province with effect from 22/06/2009. The

Petitioner states that due to his unblemished service record he became popular among the

members of the Provincial Council, which prompted some of his colleagues to show

displeasure towards him. Such acrimonious behavior towards the Petitioner had prevented

him from performing his lawful functions and duties in the Planning Department.

By letter dated 24/09/2013, marked R5, fellow officers at the Planning Department had

informed the Deputy Chief Secretary (Planning) and the Chief Secretary, that due to the

unsatisfactory working relationship with the Petitioner, they find it impossible to carry out

their duties. Letters written to the 1st Respondent by several management assistants had

requested that the Petitioner be transferred from his post. According to letter dated

14/07/2014 marked R6, and 14/07/2014 marked R8, fellow officers have alleged that

working with the Petitioner has become an impossibility due to arduous accusations and

unwarranted interference by the Petitioner with their work.

7

The 1st Respondent contends that due to the conduct of the Petitioner, severe hardship and

inconvenience was caused to the Audit branch and its co-workers. Therefore, he requested

that the Petitioner be transferred out of the said branch. (Documents marked R12, R13 and

R14). Due to the unsatisfactory working relationship with other officers, the 1st Respondent

by letter dated 29/09/2014 marked R14, has written to the Secretary of the Ministry of

Finance and Planning that the Petitioner be released from service from the Western

Provincial Council.

However, at the request of the Petitioner, a committee was appointed to look into the

administrative issues faced by the Planning Department. Accordingly, the Director of

Internal Audit conducted an inquiry into this matter and by letter dated 05/11/2014, marked

R13, recommended that the Petitioner be given a service transfer or a release from the

Provincial Council.

In the circumstances, the Petitioner filed a fundamental rights application bearing No.

SC/FR/70/2015 allegedly, to safeguard his rights to engage in lawful occupation and to

discharge his duties. However, this application was withdrawn by the Petitioner.

Thereafter, by letter dated 07/06/2016, the Petitioner was summoned by the 4th Respondent

(Deputy Chief Secretary (Administration)) for an inquiry relating to alleged disputes

arising over employee duties in the Planning Division. The Inquiry was scheduled for

08/06/2016, at 10.30 a.m. The Petitioner states that he did not appear before the Committee

of Inquiry on the said date due to the Planning Division not receiving the letter scheduling

the inquiry on time. However, the inquiry had proceeded in the absence of the Petitioner

which the Petitioner claims to be a denial of his right to defend. Thereafter, by the

impugned letter dated 04/08/2016 marked P11, the Petitioner was released from the

Western Provincial Council and was required to report to the Ministry of Public

Administration and Management.

The Petitioner submits that in the absence of a request from the 5th and 6th Respondents to

obtain the services of the Petitioner, the 1st Respondents decision to transfer the Petitioner

8

from the Western Provincial Council to the Ministry of Public Administration and

Management constitutes illegal, arbitrary and mala-fide actions which violates the

fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner prayed, inter-alia, to quash the decision of the Respondents contained in the

impugned document marked P11, which released the Petitioner from the service of the

Western Province Provincial Council.

The claim, as set out in the Petition is based on the following contentions, that;

a) in the absence of lawful representation by the Petitioner, the decision of the

Commission of Inquiry held on 08/06/2016, to transfer the Petitioner from the

Western Provincial Council to the Ministry of Planning and Management on the

basis of service requirement, is illegal and ultra vires.

b) in the absence of a request from the 5th and 6th Respondents to have the Petitioner

released on service requirement, the 1st Respondent had no authority to fill in

service requirements of an institution other than the Provincial Council of the

Western Province and as such the decision to transfer the Petitioner from the

Western Provincial Council is ultra vires, illegal and unjustifiable.

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution deals with the right to equality which states that:

"All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the

law"

In Ramuppillai Vs. Festus Perera, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial

Councils and Home Affairs and Others, Fernando J. held:

that the term the law contained in Article 12(1) relates not only to the law as it is

conventionally understood and interpreted, it would include both subordinate

legislation and executive action. Thus, for the purpose of Article 12, schemes of

recruitment, promotion and appointment would come within the scope of the term the

law

9

The Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management by letter dated

19/11/2016, marked R3, released the Petitioner from the Western Province Public Service

to the Ministry of Primary Industries. In this application the Petitioner has challenged his

release from the Western Province Public Service as reflected in the impugned document

marked P11, however the Petitioner has not challenged the decision to report to work at

the new service station i.e., Ministry of Primary Industries as reflected in document marked

R3. On the said premise, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the 1st to 4th and 8th

Respondents raised a preliminary objection to this application stating that,

The application of the Petitioner is now academic and the relief prayed for by the

Petitioner cannot be granted by this court.

Since the questions of law posed by the Petitioner would substantially answer the issue of

futility, I will now turn to the merits of this application.

According to Paragraph 12 of the Amended Petition, the Petitioner received a letter dated

07/06/2016, (Notice of Inquiry marked P10) from the Deputy Chief Secretary,

(Administration) summoning him for an inquiry relating to the alleged disputes over duties

of the employees in the Planning Division.

The Petitioner claims that it was not practically possible for him to appear before the

Committee of Inquiry on short notice, which the Petitioner claims to be a deliberate act on

the part of the 1st Respondent to keep him away from the inquiry. By letter dated

08/06/2016 marked, 2P9, the Petitioner has sought for further time to participate in the

inquiry on the basis that he received the said notice on 08/06/2016, at 11.10 a.m. The hand

written entry of the figures 11.10 a.m. indicating the time acknowledging receipt of notice

by the Planning Division is disputed by the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondents position is that the hand written date stamp entry, 11.10 a.m.

appearing in the Notice of Inquiry was placed fraudulently by the Petitioner to deliberately

avoid the inquiry.

10

The 1st Respondent contends that the inquiry was carried out 20 meters away from the

Petitioners own division and therefore, the Petitioner had no difficulty in attending the

inquiry on the given date. It is further contended that the letter marked P10 was delivered

in the morning of 08/06/2016, to the Petitioner to grant the Petitioner sufficient time to

participate in the inquiry and was not delivered at 11.10 a.m. as alleged by the Petitioner

and deny any mala fides on their part.

Based on the report submitted by the Inquiry Committee, it is observed that on the date of

inquiry, the Petitioner was not found in the workplace or could not be contacted by

telephone. However. the attendance summary which is marked R21, indicates that on

08/06/2016, the Petitioner was present at the workplace between 9.11 a.m. and 4.21 p.m.

The 1st Respondent contends that the Petitioner was requested to make a statement but

refused stating that he had not received any written request to do so. However, having given

a written request, the Petitioner failed to provide a statement.

According to the findings of the Committee of Inquiry, the Petitioner was given sufficient

time and opportunity to be heard but has deliberately refrained from participating at the

inquiry. By letter dated 04/08/2016, the Petitioner was released from the Western

Provincial Council to report to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management on

grounds of exigencies of service.

Responding to the complaints brought against him by his fellow officers, that it has become

impossible to work with the Petitioner, as more fully set out in documents marked R15,

R16, to R18, the Petitioner states that most of the officers who complain are Management

Assistants and officers who have not worked under him or who are not competent to

comment on his duties and accordingly has denied all allegations leveled against him.

The Petitioner strongly alleges that due to his continuous revelations of fraudulent and

dishonest transactions of the officers attached to the Provincial Council, the superior

officers of the Planning Division were desperate to get rid of him and therefore maliciously

engineered his release. The Petitioner states that there was no dispute between himself and

11

fellow officers in his department and denies that he requested a committee to be appointed

to look into the problems faced by him and fellow officers. However, the Petitioner states

that he was aware that a Committee of Inquiry was scheduled to inquire into allegations

brought against him. The said Committee was appointed by the 1st Respondent to look into

the problems in the Planning Division.

In Tennakoon, Assistant Superintendent of Police Vs. T.P.F. De Silva, Inspector General

of Police and others, (1997) 1 SLR 16 at page 34, Fernando J. delivering a majority

judgement on the Petitioners rights under Article 12(1), observed that:

A working relationship is that which exists between superior and subordinate, or

colleague and colleague, in one workplace; or even between two persons in different

departments, institutions or services, when the public interest requires that they work

together.

In the given circumstances, the decision to appoint a committee to look into the

unsatisfactory relationship between the Petitioner and fellow officers, in my view, was best

in the public interest.

In defining a working relationship in the public interest, in Tennakoon, Assistant

Superintendent of Police Vs. T.P.F. De Silva, Inspector General of Police and others,

(1997) 1 SLR 16 (supra) Fernando J. observed;

Let me assume, however, such a working relationship was required, in the public

interest. A bare assertion that it was unsatisfactory is not enough. The court must

ascertain whether there were grounds for that opinion, and, if there were, it must

examine those grounds; upon such an examination the court is not entitled to substitute

its own opinion, simply because it disagrees with the 1st Respondent; and it can only

intervene if that opinion is found to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or

discriminatory (or otherwise violative of fundamental rights)

Deliberately or otherwise, the Petitioner did not participate at the Committee of Inquiry

specially appointed to look into the grievances of the officers. If time constraints were to

12

prevent the Petitioner from participating at the said inquiry which was carried out a mere

20 meters away from the Petitioners own Division, the most prudent thing for him to have

done was to immediately present himself before the inquiring officer, the Deputy Chief

Secretary, (Administration) and requested for further time, which he failed to do. The

Petitioner merely avoided the inquiry process for reasons best known to him.

The strong stand taken by the Petitioner against holding an inquiry is amplified by the

answer filed to the counter affidavit of the 1st Respondent, where he has reiterated that he

never requested for an inquiry to be held. The Inquiring Officers decision to transfer the

Petitioner from the Planning Department was based on the materiel placed before him. It

is observed that at no time has the Petitioner made a request that the proposed transfer be

varied.

In the 1st contention, the inquiring officers findings are challenged on the basis that the

Petitioner was not given a reasonable opportunity to present his case. As noted above, the

facts surrounding the inquiry fails to justify this position. The decision of the Inquiry

Committee is not challenged in this application. In any event it would be inappropriate to

review the decision of the Inquiry Committee and to substitute the opinion of court to that

of the said decision. I am of the view that the inquiring officer considered the material

placed before the committee objectively and reasonably before arriving at the impugned

decision.

It is also clearly evident that the Petitioner was informed of the date of inquiry, however

has failed to avail himself the opportunity of lawful representation before the committee of

inquiry on the given date.

For the reasons stated above, the Petitioners 1st contention should fail.

The 2nd contention of the Petitioner is that, when transferring the Petitioner to the Finance

and Planning Ministry, the 1st Respondent failed to follow Procedural Rule 218 and 219 of

the Public Service Commission, published in Gazette Notification No. 1589/30, dated

20/02/2009, marked P13. It is further contended that the decision to transfer the Petitioner

13

in terms of the said rules should necessarily be taken by the 6th Respondent, for reasons

acceptable to him and accordingly the Petitioner moves to quash the impugned letter

marked P11.

The Petitioner further states that the 1st Respondent nor any other Respondent has the

authority to transfer the Petitioner in terms of Section 32 of the Provincial Councils Act

No. 42 of 1987, since it shall apply to all officers in the Provincial Public Service.

According to the Petitioner, Procedural Rule 218 and 219 of the Public Service

Commission, published in Gazette Notification No. 1589/30, dated 20/02/2009 (marked

P13) should be followed and reasons for transfer should be made known to him. The

Petitioner states that as a result of the arbitrary decision to transfer the Petitioner taken by

the 1st and 8th Respondents, denied him of his employment, monthly salary and professional

dignity he earned during his carrier.

The Petitioner was released by the 4th Respondent from the Provincial Public Service of

the Western Province in order to report to the Ministry of Administration and Management

on the basis of service requirements.

In terms of the letter of appointment dated 11/12/2008 issued by the Public Service

Commission, marked P1, the Petitioner is an officer belonging to the Planning Service. The

Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning by letter dated 19/06/2009, marked P2,

released the Petitioner to serve in the Western Province in terms of clause 7 of the Letter

of appointment, service minute and the PSC Rules.

According to the terms of Service Minute of the Planning Service Rule 12(i), in Gazette

Bearing No. 1670/32, published on 10/09/2010, marked R23, and the Procedural Rule 218

and 219 of the Public Service Commission (document marked P13) and the Public Services

Gazette No. 1941/41, published on 20/11/2015 marked R24, if the Provincial Council has

no further need to retain the services of the Petitioner, it is within the powers of the

authorities of the Provincial Council to release the Petitioner from service of the Provincial

Council.

14

Due to exigencies of service, the Petitioner was released from the Western Province Public

Service to the Planning and Administration Ministry by letter dated 02/08/2016 marked

R2. The Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management by letter dated

19/11/2016 marked R3, informed the Petitioner to report to the new station referred to

therein.

Section 32 of the Provincial Council Act states thus;

1) Subject to the provisions of any other law the appointment, transfer, dismissal and

disciplinary control of officers of the Provincial Public Service of each Province is

hereby vested in the Governor of that Province.

2) The Governor of a Province may, from time to time, delegate his powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the Provincial

Public Service to the Provincial Public Service Commission of that Province.

3) The Governor shall provide for and determine all matters relating to officers of the

Provincial Public Service, including the formulation of schemes of recruitment and

codes of conduct for such officers, the principles to be followed in making promotions

and transfers, and the procedure for the exercise and the delegation of the powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of such officers, In

formulating such schemes of recruitment and codes of conduct the Governor shall,

as far as practicable, follow the schemes of recruitment prescribed for

corresponding officers in the public service and the codes of conduct prescribed for

officers holding corresponding officers in the public service.

Rule Number 218 and 219 deals with transfers on Exigencies of Service. Accordingly, Rule

218-A states;

Public Officer may be transferred on exigencies of service by the Appointing Authority

for any one of the following reasons,

(i) Where the services of an officer is no longer needed at his present station;

15

(ii) Where an officer is needed for service in another station or that particular officer

himself is needed;

(iii) Where it is found, due to administrative reasons, that the retention of an officer

in his present station is not suitable. (Emphasis is mine)

Rule 219 states,

Before a Public Officer is transferred on exigencies of service, the Authority with

Delegated Power shall personally satisfy himself that need has actually arisen as

specified in Section 218 above and that the transfer cannot be deferred till the next

annual transfers.

In terms of Section 32 of the Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987, all powers relating to

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers of the Provincial

Council are vested with the Governor and the release of officers from service is on the

advice and the concurrence of the Governor. On a plain reading of this Section, it is clear

that such power can be delegated by the said authority.

The Petitioner also contends that the 1st Respondent or any other officer is not empowered

to transfer the Petitioner from the Provincial Council since the authority to transfer the

Petitioner is exclusively vested with the 6th Respondent in terms of Procedural Rule 218

and 219 of the Public Service Commission, published in Gazette Notification No. 1589/30

dated 20/02/2009. (P13).

Procedural Rule 218, 219 and 221 of the Public Service Commission Rules are contained

in Chapter XVIII titled transfers and under the sub heading Transfers on exigencies of

service.

In SC/FR/484/2011 decided on 16/01/2017, K. Sripavan, C.J. discussed Procedural Rule

218 and 219 of the Public Service Commission published in Gazette Notification No.

1589/30 dated 20/02/2009, where he observed that;

16

The Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission published in Government

Gazette (Extra Ordinary) No. 1589/30 dated 20/02/2009 deals with the types of

transfers that could be effected. Clause 196 of the said Rules reads thus:

Transfers are fourfold as indicated below,

i. Transfers done annually;

ii. Transfers done on exigencies of service;

iii. Transfers done on disciplinary grounds;

iv. Mutual Transfers on requests made by officers.

In terms of Section 32 of the Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987, all powers relating to

public officers of the Provincial Council are subject to the powers vested with the Governor

and therefore, the release of the Petitioner from his service should be with the concurrence

of the Governor. The Governor may delegate such powers to the Provincial Public Service

Commission and the said Provincial Public Service Commission may delegate its powers

to the Chief Secretary or any officer of the Provincial Public Service. Therefore, the

Petitioners release from the Provincial Public Service, on the basis of service

requirements, (P11) is valid in law.

The Senior State Counsel appearing for the 7th Respondent contends that the Petitioners

position that the transfer was in violation of Procedural Rules 219 and 221 published in the

Gazette extraordinary of 1589/30 dated 20/02/2009 is misconceived.

The learned Counsel has drawn the attention of court to the impugned letter marked P11,

and also to documents marked R2 and R3. It is observed that the wording of the letters and

the documents connected thereto, indicate that the Petitioner was released from the

Provincial Public Service and not transferred under Chapter XVIII of the Public Service

Commission Rules. Besides, even if it is considered as a transfer, in terms of Rule-218-A,

smooth running of the present station falls within the exigencies of service.

17

Therefore the 2nd contention of the Petitioner also has to be rejected.

Accordingly, we hold that the Petitioner has failed in establishing that his fundamental

rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 12(1) of the Constitution has been infringed by the

actions of the Respondents.

The Petition is dismissed. I order no costs.
