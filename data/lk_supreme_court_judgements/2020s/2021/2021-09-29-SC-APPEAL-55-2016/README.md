S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

I find it pertinent to first establish the facts of this case. Wickramasinghe

Mudiyanselage Podimenike, Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Menikhamy and

Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Dolimenika i.e. Plaintiffs Appellants Respondents

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiffs Respondents.) instituted partition

action by plaint dated 1st July 1998 against Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Peiris

Singho, Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Podinona, Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage

Defendants Respondents Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st 6th

Defendants Respondents) and Wasala Mudiyanselage Rosalin Nona i.e. 7th

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 16

Defendant Respondent Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 7th Defendant

Appellant). In their Plaint the Plaintiffs Respondents averred inter alia that the

original owner of the land which was sought to be partitioned was one named

Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Yahapathhamy who was a person subject to the

Kandyan Law and the land was a Paraveni (ancestral) land. Upon his death his children,

namely 1st Plaintiff Respondent, 2nd Plaintiff Respondent, 3rd Plaintiff Respondent,

1st Defendant Respondent, 2nd Defendant Respondent and Ukkubanda (deceased

father of the 4th 6th Defendants inherited the land in equal share subject to the life

interest of his widow Ranmenika.

Ranmenika passed away in 1992. Thereafter the Plaintiffs instituted an action to

partition the land in the District Court. The 1st and 2nd Defendant Respondents filed

a joint statement of claim dated 25/07/2000 admitting that Wickramasinghe

Mudiyanselage Yahapathhamy was a person who was subject to the Kandyan Law.

However, they claimed that the Plaintiff Respondents and the 2nd Defendant

Respondent are daughters who married in Diga during the lifetime of their father and

have as such forfeited their right to succession to the paraveni property. They also

claimed that Yahapathhamy was not the original owner of the land in question and

that the 1st Defendant Respondent had prescribed to the land and therefore he

sought a dismissal of the Plaintiff Respondents action.

The 1A and 7th Defendant Appellant being the wife of the 1st Defendant

Respondent filed her own statement of claims stating that the 1st Defendant had by

Deed of Gift transferred the rights to the land in suit to her and therefore sought a

dismissal of the Plaintiff Respondents action. The matter then proceeded to trial. The

3rd Plaintiff Respondent gave evidence and stated that the 4 daughters of the

deceased namely the Plaintiff Respondents and the 2nd Defendant Respondent

went out inn Diga marriage prior to the death of the deceased. She also stated that

she returned to the Mahagedara (Ancestral home also referred to as Mulgedara) in

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 16

1972 with her 4 children after the death of her husband and has remained there since.

However, the 1A and 7th Defendant Appellant provided that the 3rd Plaintiff

Respondent had not adduced any evidence as to how her forfeited rights to succession

were revived and re-admitted to the household upon the return to the Mahagedara in

1972.

Having considered the following the learned District Court judge held that the

1st to 3rd Plaintiffs have entered into valid marriages prior to the death of

Yahapathhamy in 1973 and the mere return by the Diga married 3rd Plaintiff to the

Mahagedara upon the death of her husband does not entitle her to claim rights as a

Binna married daughter. Being aggrieved by this judgment the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiff

Respondents preferred an appeal in terms of Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code to the Court of Appeal. Upon the promulgation of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act no. 54 of 2006, said appeal was heard

by the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden at Kurunegala.

The primary issue that was to be determined by the High Court was the issue

of whether the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent who had gotten married under the General

Marriage Ordinance on 28/03/1957 and who had subsequently returned to the

Mahagedara after her husbands death in 1972 had acquired the rights of a Binna

married daughter. The High Court judge came to the conclusion that there is no

evidence to show that the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff ever came back within the paternal power

to make them heirs of Yahapathhamy. It was also held that the 2nd Defendant

Respondent had disclaimed any rights in the case itself. The High Court Judge held

that the heirs of Yahapathhamy for the land that was sought to be partitioned were

the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent, 1st Defendant Respondent and the children of

Ukkubanda and that they should inherit an undivided 1/3rd each from the land that

was sought to be partitioned, thus the appeal of the Plaintiffs Respondents was

allowed.

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 16

Being aggrieved by this decision the 1A and 7th Defendant Appellant an

appeal to this court to have the decision of the High Court set aside. Leave to appeal

was granted under (b), (d) and (e) of paragraph 18 of the Petition dated 13th August

2013. These questions of law have been reproduced for ease of reference.

(18.)

b. the learned provincial high court judge has erred in law by coming to the

conclusion that Yahapathhamy;

i. Had readmitted Dolimenika as a binna married daughter by allowing her

to possess the land comprising of the mulgedara 7-8 years prior to his

death.

ii. Could, in law, re-admit Dolimenika as a binna married daughter 7-8

years prior to his death during the subsistence of her diga marriage in

contravention of Section 9(1) of the Kandyan Law Declaration and

Amendment Ordinance No. 39 of 1938.

d. the learned Provincial High Court Judge has erred in law by coming to the

conclusion that Yahapathhamy could, in law, grant rights in relation to

immovable property, to the 3rd Plaintiff, in contravention of Section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance No. 7 of 1840

e. the learned Provincial High Court Judge has erred in law by misapplying the

burden of proof required in proving that Dolimenika had in fact regained binna

rights.

After considering the available material I find that the decisive factor in this

matter is the issue with regards to the 3rd Plaintiff Respondents marriage. Namely

whether it was in fact readmitted as a Binna marriage as the High Court had done in

its judgment.

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 16

After perusing the material before us, it is apparent that the daughter was given

in marriage under the General Marriage Ordinance in the year 1957 and after her

husbands death in 1972 after approximately 15 years of marriage she was allowed to

live with her parents in her Mulgedara and continued to do so until her fathers death.

Her claim is that upon coming back to her Mulgedara she acquired the rights of a

woman under the Binna marriage.

For purposes of clarity, I will first differentiate a Diga marriage from a Binna

marriage. Marriage in Diga and Binna are the two methods of marriage under the

Kandyan Law. A Diga marriage according to the Kandyan law is when a woman is given

away and is settled in the home of her husband, which is the more common of the two

types of marriages. A Binna marriage is one where the bridegroom is received into the

house of the bride and according to certain stipulations abides there permanently. This

type of marriage would more commonly occur where the bride is an heiress or a

daughter of a wealthy family in which there are few sons. The type of marriage entered

into directly effects the succession to property. A Diga married daughter does not

typically succeed to the property of her father. Whereas a Binna married daughter

retains her to succession after the marriage. Hence one of the most pressing issues in

this case is whether the 3rd Plaintiff had reacquired the rights of a Binna married

daughter when she returned to her Mulgedara after the demise of her husband.

It is also notable that the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent was married under the

provisions of the General Marriages Ordinance. The general practice in relation to

marriages registered under the General Marriages Ordinance is that where an entry as

to the nature of the marriage is absent, the presumption is that the marriage is a Diga

marriage. This was discussed in the case of Lewis Singho v Kusumawathie and others

2003 (2) SLR 128. In this case Dissanayake, J stated as follows;

Applying the above principles where a party who is governed by the Marriage and

Divorce (Kandyan) Act contracts a marriage under the Marriage Registration

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 16

Ordinance, in the absence of an entry in the certificate of marriage with regard

to the nature of the so marriage contracted the presumption recognised under

section 28(1) of the Marriage and Divorce (Kandyan) Act would be applicable and

such a marriage would be presumed to have been one of Diga until the contrary

is proved.

Thus since in the certificate of marriage of Enso Nona (V1) which is one issued

under the General Marriages Ordinance, where an entry with regard to the

nature of marriage is absent, the presumption is that the marriage is Diga

and not Binna.

(Emphasis added)

Fredrick Austin Haley in his book A Treaties on the laws and customs of the Sinhalese

also wrote about this presumption. In page 195 of this book, it has been stated that in

the absence of an entry in the register specifying its nature, the marriage is presumed

to be a Diga one until the contrary is proved. This is also referenced in the

aforementioned judgment by Justice Dissanayake. Thus it is presumed that the

marriage of the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent is a Diga marriage. It is also vital to note that

the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent when asked in cross examination whether she and the

2nd Plaintiff Respondent went in Diga marriage, had replied in the affirmative.

Thus, it is apparent that for the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent to succeed to her

fathers property, her Diga marriage should have converted into a Binna marriage as

Diga married daughters have no right to their fathers property. Section 9 (1) of the

Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance sets out the nature of these two

types of marriages. It states as follows;

Section 9

(1) A marriage contracted after the commencement of this Ordinance in binna or in

diga shall be and until dissolved shall continue to be, for all purposes of the law

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 16

governing the succession to the estates of deceased persons, a binna or a diga

marriage, as the case may be, and shall have full effect as such ; and no change

after any such marriage in the residence of either party to that marriage

and no conduct after any such marriage of either party to that marriage or

of any other person shall convert or be deemed to convert a binna marriage

into a diga marriage or a diga marriage into a binna marriage or cause or

be deemed to cause a person married in diga to have the rights of

succession of a person married in binna, or a person married in binna to

have the rights of succession of a person married in diga.

(Emphasis added)

However there have been certain circumstances where daughters who have

been married in Diga have acquired certain Binna rights. In Armours Grammar of the

Kandyan Law by Joseph Martinus Perera these circumstances have been established.

A few of these circumstances are, where a Diga married daughter is recalled by her

father and remained in the fathers house until his demise, and if after she was married,

she was married in Binna, and if the son lived away from his fathers house settled in

Binna in his wifes village, then the daughter and the son will inherit equal shares of

the fathers estate. Another instance is where the Diga married daughter returns

destitute. In those circumstances she will be entitled to maintenance. However, in this

matter it does not seem that the 3rd Plaintiff Respondent had acted in a manner in

which her Diga rights had converted into Binna rights. Although there has been a

change of residence this does not necessarily confer the rights of a Binna married

daughter on a Diga married one. In Sawers Digest of Kandyan Law (page 2) the

change in the nature of these marriages is discussed.

Daughters, while they remain in their fathers house, have a temporary joint

interest with their brothers in the landed property of their parents; but this they

lose when given out in what is called a deega marriage, either by their

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 16

parents or brothers, after the death of the parents. It is, however, reserved for the

daughters, in the event of their being divorced from their deega husbands,

or becoming widows destitute of the means of support, that they have a

right to return to the house of their parents and there to have lodging and

support and clothing from their parents estate; but the children born to a

deega husband have no right of inheritance in the estate of their mothers parents

(Emphasis added)

This principle was discussed extensively in the case of Jayasinghe v Kiribindu

and Others 1997 (2) SLR 1. In this case it was stated as follows;

There is no dispute that Kiribindu, the plaintiff-respondent, never left her

parental home and lived in it before and after the death of her father. However,

was she allowed to settle in binna in the mulgedera? Living in the mulgedera (or

on ancestral properties e.g. see D.C. Kurunegala 19107 (1873) Ill Grenier 115;

Dingiri Amma v. Ukku Amma, having a binna connection: cf Gonigoda v.

Dunuwlla, cf also Doratiyawe v. Ukku Banda Korale, did not automatically confer

rights of inheritance on a daughter who had been married in diga. Her rights

would depend on whether her residence could be regarded as a settlement

in binna in the house or property of the father. Whether there was a settlement

in binna would depend on the establishment of that fact established by the

evidence in a particular case. In Re Mahara Ratemahatmaya, where a man lived

for some years in the family house of a woman with the intention of forming a

marital connection, it was held by Rowe, C.J. and Morgan J. that, unless there be

some substantial proof to the contrary arising from a proved disparity of rank or

other legal obstacle, that would amount to a marriage in binna.

On the other hand, as we have seen, if a daughter who had gone out in diga be

divorced, or left a widow, or ill-treated or reduced to penury by her husband's

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 16

misfortune or bad conduct, she is entitled, on returning to her parents, to live with

them and be supported.

However, although there was residence, that alone did not confer the rights

of a binna married daughter on such a person.

(Emphasis added)

In this case it was further stated;

undoubtedly the place of residence is an important indicator of the character of

a marriage. Ordinarily, in the absence of contrary evidence we ought to be entitled

to presume that the common course of usual events consistent with the ordinary

practices of Kandyan Society followed. And so, a woman who after marriage lived

in her mulgedara with her husband maybe supposed to have been settled in

binna. On the other hand, it would be expected that a woman married in diga

would have been led away from her parental home. It was a symbolic

manifestation of the departure of the woman to join another family and bear

children who will belong to a different genes.

Such a person would live in her husbands home or upon the property of her new

family. However, if it was agreed that the marriage was a diga marriage, it would

be a diga marriage, irrespective of the fact that the bride took up residence in her

fathers housethe determination of the character is, perhaps unfortunately, but

nevertheless, somewhat more complex than seeking a response to the simple

question: where did she live?

Taking the aforementioned into consideration I find that the marriage of the 3rd

Plaintiff Respondent had not been converted into a Binna marriage. Furthermore, the

burden of proof in proving against the presumption of a Diga marriage lies with the

person who claims that she comes under a Binna marriage. The 3rd Plaintiff

Respondent has not provided this court with sufficient material to rebut the

presumption of a Diga marriage nor has there been any material produced to prove

SC Appeal 55/2016 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 16

that she had returned to the Mulgedara under any of the circumstances mentioned

above that may confer on her any of the rights a Binna daughter might have.

Taking the aforementioned into consideration I answer the 1A and 7th

Defendant Appellant questions of law affirmatively.

On careful analysis of the material that was produced before the high court I

am of the view that the judgment given in NP/HCCA/KUR/88/2003 is erroneous and

thus I am inclined to allow the appeal of the 1A and 7th Defendant Appellant.
