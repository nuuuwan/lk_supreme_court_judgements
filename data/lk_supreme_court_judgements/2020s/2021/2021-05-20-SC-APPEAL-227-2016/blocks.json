Further that if there is an irremediable loss or damage, an injunction will be granted and the applicant must come to courts with clean hands and maintain uberima fide. \u2022 The deed of lease no.394 was not subject to the scrutiny of the Colombo District Court. Hence, there is no hindrance to file and maintain an action on a cause of action based on that lease and to see whether the said lease is valid and, whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the possession on that deed. \u2022 As per the order published in the Gazette to vest the property in the 1st Defendant, there was no condition imposed that it cannot be given on lease. \u2022 The 1st Defendant has given it on a lease to the Plaintiff for 50 years, in a manner binding its successors for the obligation created by the lease agreement. \u2022 As per the circumstances of the case at hand, 2nd and 3rd Defendants can be interpreted as the successors of the 1st Defendant. \u2022 Hence, there is a strong prima facie case for the Plaintiff. \u2022 Still the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are awaiting to take the possession, and if the interim injunction is not given the huge money invested by the Plaintiff to the Hydropower project is at a loss and even the supply of electricity to the national grid and the function of the project itself are also at a risk. Interim injunction will not harm the 5th Defendant which gain electricity from the Project. The harm caused to the 1st ,2nd and 3rd Defendants by issuing an interim injunction would be comparatively less than the harm to the plaintiff if it is not issued. Thus, the balance of convenience was in favour of the Plaintiff. \u2022 The Plaintiff is not guilty of not disclosing material facts or for misrepresentation and also not in breach of Uberima Fide.

The cause of action in the Nawalapitiya District Court case is based on the imminent threat of eviction and disconnection of electricity supply of the Plaintiff owing to a court order in the said Colombo District Court case where the Plaintiff was not a party. It is true that the Plaintiff could have legally objected to the execution of decree or may tender a written statement of claim during the execution process or can make an application after the dispossession -vide section325 and 328 of the Civil Procedure Code. Even when such a claim fails, the Plaintiff Petitioner has the right to file an action to establish his right or title to the property \u2013 vide section 329 of the said code. However, there is no prohibition that, when a party has a cause of action due to imminent threat of eviction or disturbance to his possession (like disconnecting of electricity) he cannot straightly institute an action. It is difficult to understand how an order to disconnect electricity supply to the Plaintiff which affects his rights went out from the Colombo District Court when there was no prayer to that effect and when the Plaintiff was not a party to that case. However, these circumstances were not contemplated by the learned High Court Judges in allowing the appeal and vacating the interim injunctions. The learned High Court judges have come to a conclusion that the Land Reform Commission has given permission for the Defendants to occupy at the beginning, and it has been cancelled by the letter dated 26.11.2006. This also indicate that the High Court did not comprehend the facts and cause of action. As per the undisputed facts, through a Gazette notification dated 31.05.1982 the land, Bowhill estate was vested with the 1st Defendant and it was revoked with regard to the extent of lands described in the Extraordinary Gazette no.1457/22 dated 11.08.2006. After that a letter dated 29.11.2006 had been issued by the Land Reform Commission to the Superintendent of the Bowhill Estate of the 1st Defendant to hand over the said lands referred to in the latter Gazette. Further, the learned High Court Judges have expressed the view that the interim injunctions prayed by the Plaintiff, if granted, give the final reliefs prayed by the Plaintiff. However, the prayer in the plaint separately contained the declaratory reliefs and permanent injunctions which are of a final and permanent nature but the interim injunctions were prayed to maintain the status quo till the final decision of the case. Since, the",

    "text": "As per the sequence of events, it is clear that once the Bowhill Estate belonged to the 2nd and 3rd Defendant\u2019s father and later on, as per the land reform laws, it was vested in the Land Reform Commission. Thereafter, as per the order made by the Minister of Agricultural Research and Development in terms of sections 27A, 22 and 23 of the Land Reform Law, published in the Gazette dated 31.051982, marked as X3, that estate was vested with the 1st Defendant, Janatha Estate Development Board. It must be noted that there are no conditions or prohibitions laid down in that order with regard to the title, possession or with regard to giving it on lease. The 1st Defendant thereafter, leased out lots 1-6 of the plan no. 3120 made by A. A. Padmadasa, Licensed surveyor by deed of lease no.394 dated 13.02.2004, marked X5, to the Plaintiff Company for the purpose of putting up a Mini Hydropower Project. The extent so leased out was 17 Acres and 27 perches. Meanwhile, it appears, by an order published in the Extra Ordinary Gazette No.1457/22 dated 11.08.2006, the Minister revoked the vesting order that gave the Bowhill Estate to the 1st Defendant with regard to the lots and extents described in the schedule to the said gazette, which described the areas as lot 1 and 2 of plan no.1379 dated 29.05.2006 and lot 1 of plan no.1378 dated 29.05.2006 made by licensed surveyor S P H Thennekoon. Total Extent of the said lots were 100 Acres. Thereafter, the Land Reform Commission has transferred the said land to the 2nd and 3rd defendants by deed no.392. It appears that on the strength of the said documents and circumstances the 2nd and 3rd Defendants instituted the Colombo District Court case against the 1st Defendant to get a declaration of title and recover the possession of said 100 Acres. It must be noted that even though the 1st Defendant had given a part of the Bowhill Estate to the Plaintiff on lease, neither that fact has been revealed nor it was prayed to add the Plaintiff as a party to that case by any of the parties to that action. It is also pertinent to note that even though, the portion given to the Plaintiff by the said lease and the portion released to the 2nd and 3rd defendants are parts of Bowhill Estate, there was no finding in that case that the parts of Bowhill Estate given to",

    "text": "the Plaintiff by the 1st Defendant falls within the Parts of Bowhill estate released to the 2nd and 3rd defendant. In the aforesaid backdrop, it is questionable how the District Court issued an order in the said action affecting the rights of the Plaintiff who was not a party to the said action. This Court observes that there had been an admission made in the Colombo District Court case that the 1st Defendant was given only the right to possess by the Land Reform Commission. However, the Plaintiff was not a party to that admission and he is not bound by that admission. The Plaintiff\u2019s rights have to be decided as per the law and as said before, there was no condition or limitation or prohibition on the 1st Defendant when the Bowhill Estate was given to it by the aforesaid order published in the Gazette. As per Section 27A (2) of the land reform Law, once the vesting order is made, the relevant State Corporation gets the right, title and interest as was held by the Land reform Commission on the day immediately preceding the date on which the vesting order takes effect. As such the Plaintiff in the Nawalapitiya District Court Case had a Prima facie case to establish that its deed of lease is valid as it was given by one of the predecessors of title to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants even if the land contemplated in the deed of lease falls within the land given to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. On the other hand, if the lots given to the Plaintiff fall outside the lots given to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, the decision in the Colombo District Court has no relevance to the case filed in the District Court of Nawalapitiya, and still the Plaintiff has a prima facie case against the Defendants as there appears to be an imminent threat to its rights by using the Colombo District Court case decision against him. As per the objections filed by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in the Nawalapitiya District Court case, they have taken up the position that the 1st Defendant had no right to enter into lease agreements and also that the Plaintiff need not have been made a party in the Colombo District Court case since he was a lessee of the 1st Defendant and came to the land in that case under him. As indicated above the Plaintiff could have presented a prima facie case that the lease is valid as he is not bound by the admissions made in the Colombo District Court. On the other hand, there was no finding in the Colombo District Court case that lots in the Plaintiff\u2019s lease fall within the lots in the schedule to the Plaint in the Colombo District Court case. Even for the sake of argument one accepts that the lease is not valid, there appears to be ample material that the Plaintiff is a bona fide possessor and he has invested and made improvements. Without making the Plaintiff a party to Colombo case and deciding its rights, the",

Thus, this court is not inclined to accept the argument that the Plaintiff need not have been made party to the Colombo District Court case and therefore there was no Prima facie case for it in the Nawalapitiya case. Contrary to the said position the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in their written submission attempt to argue that the Plaintiff has encroached the 2nd and 3rd Defendants\u2019 land when it belonged to the 1st Defendant. If it is an encroachment of a different part of the Bowhill Estate that did not fall within the land given on lease, it is a different cause of action for a case that has to be filed against the Plaintiff. In such situation, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants cannot rely on the judgment given against the 1st Defendant as such encroachment is not an act of the 1st Defendant but an independent act of the Plaintiff.",
