Facts of the Application

The petitioner filed the instant application challenging the acquisition of a land for the

development of St. Mary’s College, Veyangoda.

The petitioner stated that she was the owner of the land depicted as ‘Lot 1’ in Plan No.790

dated 13th of March, 1988 prepared by Licensed Surveyor A.D.M.J. Rupasinghe, in an extent

of 1 rood and 0.62 perches.

The petitioner further stated that a notice under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, No. 09

of 1950, as amended [hereinafter referred to as “the Land Acquisition Act”] was published by

3

the 2nd respondent on the 13th of June, 2002 stating that the land known as Gorakagahalanda,

in an extent of 04 acres and 03 roods, is intended to be acquired for the public purpose of

developing St. Mary’s College.

Moreover, the petitioner stated that her house and the appurtenant land, in an extent of 1 rood

and 0.62 perches, are situated in the said Gorakagahalanda land. Further, she claimed that she

had servitude rights to use an access road and the well situated in the said Gorakagahalanda

land.

Thereafter, a notice under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was published on the 10th of

October, 2003 by the 2nd respondent calling for objections, if any, to the intended acquisition

of the said land. In response to the said notice, at the request of the petitioner, her husband had

forwarded objections to the proposed acquisition.

The petitioner stated that on the 12th of May, 2005 a government surveyor attempted to survey

the said Gorakagahalanda land where the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land are

situated.

Hence, she had filed the writ application bearing CA(Writ) Application No. 1016/05, on the

22nd of June, 2005, in the Court of Appeal seeking, inter alia, a writ of certiorari to quash the

notices issued under sections 2 and 4 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The petitioner stated that whilst the said writ application was pending in the Court of Appeal,

a declaration in terms of section 5 of the said Act was published by the 1st respondent, in the

Gazette No. 1461/16 dated 08th of September, 2006, stating that a part of the said

Gorakagahalanda land depicted as ‘Lot 2’, in the Advanced Tracing No. GAM/ATH/02/275

prepared by the Surveyor General, was required for the public purpose of St. Mary’s College.

Further, in the said Advanced Tracing, the land intended to be acquired, in an extent of 1.2298

hectares, was depicted as ‘Lot 2’ while the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land to the

house, in an extent of 1 rood and 0.62 perches, were depicted as ‘Lot 1’. Accordingly, the

petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land had been excluded from the acquisition process.

Subsequent to the said declaration, the petitioner had withdrawn the said writ application on

the 28th of November, 2006 reserving the right to file a fresh application with additional

documents.

4

The petitioner stated that the 2nd respondent, by letter dated 21st of January, 2009, informed her

that steps were being taken to acquire the said land Gorakagahalanda for the development of

St. Mary’s College excluding the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land. Further, by the

said letter, the petitioner was asked to contact the Zonal Director of Education or the Secretary

to the Ministry of Education to discuss the issues pertaining to the petitioner’s servitude rights

claimed over the land intended to be acquired.

The petitioner further stated that the access road proposed by the State was unacceptable as,

inter alia, it was situated four and a half feet below her house and gave access from the rear

side of the house.

Thereafter, a meeting had been convened on the 13th of February, 2009 to discuss the issues

pertaining to the petitioner’s alleged servitude right to use the access road and the well situated

in ‘Lot 2’ of the said Gorakagahalanda land intended to be acquired.

The petitioner further stated that at the said meeting, she conveyed, inter alia, that she would

be amenable for her house and appurtenant land situated in ‘Lot 1’ to be given for acquisition,

if an alternative land in an extent of 90 perches was given to her. Accordingly, the 2nd

respondent had offered an alternative land in extent of 60 perches in lieu of her house and the

appurtenant land, by letter dated 04th of March 2009. However, the petitioner stated that she

refused the said offer, by letter dated 09th of March, 2009, as the value of the house, appurtenant

land and the servitude rights attached were greater than the value of the 60 perches offered.

Moreover, the petitioner stated that the exclusion of the house owned by one Sanath

Karunarathne and the shop owned by one Jayawardene, which were situated in between the

school premises and its playground, from the acquisition process was discriminatory.

The petitioner stated that even though she was informed by letter dated 22nd of June, 2009 that

the land sought to be acquired would be surveyed, a government surveyor conducted the survey

on the 02nd of July, 2009 of not only the land intended to be acquired but the entire land

including the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land.

Subsequent to the said survey of the land, the petitioner has filed the instant application on the

16th of July, 2009 stating, inter alia, that the land acquisition process had reverted to the initial

stage whereby steps were being taken to acquire the entire land of ‘Gorakagahalanda’

including her house and the appurtenant land that she and her family had been residing for over

5

forty years constituting to an infringement of her Fundamental Rights under Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

In the circumstances, the petitioner prayed, inter alia:

“(b) [To] declare that anyone or more or all of the respondents have violated the

fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution of Sri Lanka.

(c) [To] make order directing the respondents to grant the petitioner an alternative

land in an extent of 90 perches as demarcated in P14, in the event of the Petitioner’s

house and appurtenant land being acquired.

(d) [To] make order directing the respondent to provide a convenient alternative

route in the event of the acquisition of the entire land (Lot 2 of P2) excepting the

petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land.

(e) [To] make order directing the respondents to grant compensation to the

petitioner in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act, for the portion of the land

that would be acquired.”

This court has granted the petitioner leave to proceed for the alleged violation of the petitioner’s

Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Objections of the 2nd Respondent

The 2nd respondent filed an affidavit objecting to the granting of the reliefs prayed for in the

petition and stated that the land sought to be acquired was for the public purpose of providing

better learning facilities for about 2200 students of St. Mary’s College, Veyangoda. He stated

that the said public purpose, which was not disputed by the petitioner, is being frustrated due

to the conduct of the petitioner.

The 2nd respondent further stated that as described in the declaration issued under section 5 of

the Land Acquisition Act, the land sought to be acquired by the State was ‘Lot 2’ of the land

called Gorakagahalanda. Hence, the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land which is

situated in ‘Lot 1’ of Gorakagahalanda would not be acquired by the State.

Further, the 2nd respondent had informed the petitioner, by letter dated 21st of January, 2009,

that the petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land had been excluded from the acquisition

6

process considering the objections raised by the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner’s contention

that the land acquisition process has reverted to the initial stage has no merit.

The 2nd respondent further stated that a meeting was held on the 13th of February, 2009 to

discuss the concerns of the petitioner pertaining to the servitude rights, claimed by her, over

the land proposed to be acquired, and that at the said meeting, the petitioner had suggested to

give her house and the appurtenant land to the State and to have an alternative land as

compensation for the acquisition of her house and the appurtenant land.

Consequently, the 2nd respondent, by letter dated 04th of March, 2009, had asked the petitioner

whether she would be amenable to accept an alternative land in an extent of 60 perches as

compensation for the acquisition of her house and the appurtenant land. In response, the

petitioner has refused the said offer, by letter dated 09th of March 2009, stating that the value

of the house, appurtenant land and the servitude rights attached to ‘Lot 2’ were greater than the

60 perches offered by the 2nd respondent.

Responding to the alleged servitude right to use an access road over the land that is sought to

be acquired, the 2nd respondent stated that in lieu of the petitioner’s said servitude right over

‘Lot 2’ of Gorakagahalanda, the petitioner has been provided a suitable access road, bordering

the western boundary of the petitioner’s house, which connects to a by-road that leads directly

to the Nittambuwa-Veyangoda main road. He further stated that using the said road does not

cause any impediment to access the house and appurtenant land of the petitioner as it is situated

only two feet above the said access road.

Responding to the allegation that the two lands situated near St. Mary’s College, Veyangoda,

owned by one Sanath Karunarathne and one Jayawardena have been excluded from the

acquisition process, the 2nd respondent stated that a final decision on the acquisition of the said

two properties had not yet been taken. In any event, as the petitioner’s house and the

appurtenant land have been excluded from the acquisition process the petitioner’s contention

on discrimination is without merit.

In the circumstances, the 2nd respondent prayed inter alia;

(a) The petitioner’s application is filed out of time,

(b) The petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought in the prayer to the petition, and

(c) The petitioner has misrepresented material facts and that her application lacks

uberrimae fides.

7

Is the application filed out of time?

In view of the above preliminary objections raised on behalf of the respondents, the objection

that the instant application of the petitioner is filed out of time will be considered first.

Article 126(2) of the Constitution states:

“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on his behalf,

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of court as may be in force,

apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such Court

praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such application may

be proceeded with only with leave to proceed first had and obtained from the

Supreme Court, which leave may be granted or refused, as the case may be, by not

less than two judges”. [Emphasis Added]

A plain reading of the said Article 126(2) shows that any person who alleges a violation of a

Fundamental Right shall file an application within one month of the alleged violation.

Our courts have held that the one-month time limit stipulated in the aforesaid Article should be

strictly adhered to by the petitioners.

In the case of Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam and others, (1985) 1 SLR 100 at page 105, it was

held:

“This Court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of one month

set out in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution, is mandatory”.

It is settled law that the mandatory time limits set out by the legislator shall be strictly complied

with as it affects the invoking of the jurisdiction of a court.

This view was expressed in Gamaethige v. Siriwardena (1988) 1 SLR 384 at page 400 where

Mark Fernando J. cited the case of Jayawardena v. Attorney-General, (F.R.D. (1) page 175)

with approval where it was held:

“… an application made more than one month after the alleged infringement was

refused on the ground that the jurisdiction of this Court cannot be exercised after

the lapse of one month from the date of the executive or administrative act

complained of.” [Emphasis Added]

8

Similarly, the requirement to comply with stipulated time limits to invoke the jurisdiction of a

court was discussed in the case of Edward v. De Silva, 46 NLR 342 at pages 343-344, where

it was held:

“It is hardly necessary to labour the point since the language of Chapter 49 of the

Code makes it sufficiently clear that the Legislature in enacting, as it did, was

creating an exception to the ordinary rule, but in a qualified and limited way. In

other words, the Legislature continued the jurisdiction, that is to say, the

competency of the Court as the Court appointed to try and determine the case,

beyond its ordinary limits, but it took care to see, as it almost invariably does, that

its jurisdiction, in the sense of its power to act, and of its correct action are made

dependent on the observance of rules of procedure. Some of those rules are so vital,

being of the spirit of law, of the very essence of judicial action, that a failure to

comply with them would result in a failure of jurisdiction or power to act, and that

would render anything done or any order made thereafter devoid of legal

consequence...” [Emphasis Added]

When did the petitioner become aware of the alleged infringement?

Article 126(2) of the Constitution states that an application for infringement or imminent

infringement of Fundamental Rights can be filed “within one month thereof” in the Supreme

Court.

The word “within” used in the said Article requires the period of one month to be calculated

from the date of the alleged infringement, imminent infringement, or from the date on which

the petitioner became aware of the alleged infringement, if knowledge on the part of the

petitioner is required to establish the alleged infringement.

This was discussed in Gamaethige v. Siriwardena (supra) at page 402 which states:

“Three principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time limit

prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the infringement takes place;

if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other instances by

comparison with which the treatment meted out to him becomes discriminatory),

time begins to run only when both infringement and knowledge exist.”

9

In the instant application, the land acquisition process had commenced with the publication of

the notice under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act on the 13th of June, 2002. Thereafter, a

notice under section 4 of the said Act had been published on the 10th of October, 2003. The

petitioner had filed the writ application challenging the said land acquisition proceedings in the

Court of Appeal on the 22nd of June, 2005. In the said writ application, the petitioner had prayed

for, inter alia, a writ of certiorari to set aside or quash the notices issued under sections 2 and

4 of the said Act.

However, the petitioner had withdrawn the said writ application with liberty to file a fresh

application with additional documents on the 28th of November, 2006 consequent to the

publication of the declaration issued by the 1st respondent under section 5 of the Land

Acquisition Act on the 08th of September, 2006. Accordingly, the said application had been

pro forma dismissed. Thereafter, the instant application had been filed in this court on the 16th

of July, 2009.

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that on the 08th of September, 2006, with the

publication of the declaration issued under section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act, the petitioner

became aware that her house and the appurtenant land, situated in ‘Lot 1’, have been excluded

from the acquisition process under reference. Further, the petitioner had come to know that the

servitude rights claimed by the petitioner over ‘Lot 2’ of Gorakagahalanda land to use an

‘access road’ and the ‘well’ would be affected by the proposed acquisition.

Is there a continuing infringement?

The learned Counsel for the petitioner, citing the case of Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others

v. Dharmasena Dissanayake, SC/FR/206/2008, SC Minutes dated 09th of December, 2016,

submitted that in the event of a continuous infringement, the one-month time limit stipulated

in Article 126(2) of the Constitution is not applicable.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that that even following the withdrawal of

the petitioner’s writ application, the issues surrounding the acquisition process were animate

as the respondents were negotiating with the petitioner to obtain her consent to have her house

and the appurtenant land to be acquired to the State. As such, it was submitted that the

infringement alleged in the instant application is a continuous infringement.

10

Accordingly, it is useful to examine the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in order to

ascertain whether the alleged violation is a continuous infringement as contended by the

petitioner.

The land acquisition process under reference has proceeded until the publication of the

declaration under section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act. The notices published under sections

2 and 4 of the Land Acquisition Act for the said land acquisition process have included the

petitioner’s house and the appurtenant land. However, the words used in the said sections 2 and

4 clearly indicate that during the said stages, the State only investigates the suitability of a

particular property for the public purpose of the acquisition and considers the objections raised

by the property owners against the intended acquisition.

Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act states as follows:

“(1) Where the Minister decides under subsection (5) of section 4 that a particular

land or servitude should be acquired under this Act, he shall make a written

declaration that such land or servitude is needed for a public purpose and will be

acquired under this Act, and shall direct the acquiring officer of the district in

which the land which is to be acquired or over which the servitude is to be acquired

is situated to cause such declaration in the Sinhala, Tamil and English languages

to be published in the Gazette and exhibited in some conspicuous places on or near

that land.

(2) A declaration made under subsection (1) in respect of any land or servitude

shall be conclusive evidence that such land or servitude is needed for a public

purpose.

(3) The publication of a declaration under subsection (1) in the Gazette shall be

conclusive evidence of the fact that such declaration was duly made”.

[Emphasis Added]

In view of the above, the declaration published under section 5 of the said Act is justiciable as

it is considered “conclusive evidence” that a land or a servitude is needed for a public purpose.

In the instant application, the said declaration has excluded the petitioner’s house and the

appurtenant land. Thus, it is conclusive evidence that neither the petitioner’s house nor the

appurtenant land will be acquired by the State.

11

Further, the reliefs as prayed for by the petitioner in subparagraph (c) and (e) of the prayer will

not arise for consideration by this court as her property is excluded from the land acquisition

process. In any event, the question of compensation has not arisen as the acquisition process

has not been completed.

Moreover, the Counsel for the petitioner submitted that with the receipt of the notice dated 22nd

of June, 2009 by the surveyor informing of the survey of Gorakagahalanda land, the petitioner

believed that her house and the appurtenant land were going to be acquired by the State. As

such, he submitted that the one-month period should be computed from the date of the said

notice by the surveyor.

However, upon perusal of the said notice dated 22nd of June, 2009, it is evident that it gives

notice to the petitioner that the Gorakagahalanda land would be surveyed on the 02nd of July,

2009.

In any event, section 6 of the said Act enables the Survey Department to survey a land after a

declaration is made under section 5 of the said Act in order to prepare a plan for the purpose of

proceeding with the procedure stipulated in the Act.

Thus, since the land sought to be acquired is a portion of Gorakagahalanda land, it is necessary

to survey the entire land to prepare a plan demarcating the boundaries of the Lots that are to be

acquired and to be excluded from the acquisition process.

Further, the said notice has only stated what the petitioner was already aware of since the 08th

of September, 2007 consequent to the publication of the declaration under section 5 of the said

Act and thus, the said notice cannot be construed as an attempt to acquire the property of the

petitioner. In any event, the 1st respondent has clearly stated in his affidavit that her property

has been excluded from the land acquisition process under reference.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that there is no continuous infringement of the

petitioner’s rights as contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner.

Delay in filing the application

As stated above, the petitioner has withdrawn the writ application filed in the Court of Appeal

after the said declaration under section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was published.

12

Further, subsequent to the withdrawal of the said writ application on the 28th of November,

2006, a meeting had been held between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent on the 13th of

February, 2009 to discuss issues of the petitioner pertaining to the acquisition process under

reference. During the said meeting, even though her house and the appurtenant land were

excluded from the acquisition process, the petitioner had proposed to hand over the same in

exchange for a 90-perch block of land as compensation.

As an amicable settlement, the petitioner had been offered an alternative land in an extent of

60 perches in lieu of her house and the appurtenant land by letter dated 04th of March, 2009.

However, by letter dated 09th of March, 2009, the petitioner had rejected the said offer on the

basis that her house and the appurtenant land are more valuable than the said offer.

A surveyor had given notice to the petitioner of the survey of Gorakagahalanda land on the

22nd of June 2009, and the said survey had been conducted on the 02nd of July, 2009. Thereafter,

the petitioner had filed the instant application on the 16th of July, 2009.

The abovementioned events show that the petitioner had spent two and a half years, from the

date of the publication of declaration in terms of section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act, seeking

administrative reliefs, before she filed the instant application in the Supreme Court on the 16th

of July, 2009.

Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the time spent in seeking administrative reliefs can be

excluded when computing the one-month period stipulated in Article 126(2) of the

Constitution.

Can the time spent in seeking administrative reliefs be excluded from the computation of

one month?

Article 126(2) does not specify any instances which could be excluded from the computation

of the one-month period. However, if a person has filed a complaint in the Human Rights

Commission, section 13 of the Human Rights Commission Act, No. 21 of 1996 provides that

the time period where an inquiry is pending before the Human Rights Commission shall not be

taken into account when computing the one-month time limit prescribed in Article 126(2) of

the Constitution.

13

Further, in the case of Namasivayam v. Gunawardena (1989) 1 SLR 394, the Supreme Court

held that if a person was hindered from having access to the Supreme Court due to his detention,

the said period should be excluded when computing the one-month time limit.

It is pertinent to note that none of the aforementioned grounds are applicable to the instant

application. On the contrary, the petitioner had been seeking administrative relief since she had

withdrawn the said writ application filed in the Court of Appeal.

Accordingly, the time spent in seeking administrative reliefs without invoking the Fundamental

Rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court cannot be excluded when computing the mandatory

one-month time limit stipulated in Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

A similar view was expressed in Gamaethige v. Siriwardena (supra) at page 396 wherein Mark

Fernando J. further held:

“It was the Petitioner’s contention, however, that although he might have been

entitled to apply to this Court in January or February 1986, it was the refusal of

his final appeal that constituted the operative infringement for the purpose of

computing the time limit of one month. This contention is untenable. If a person is

entitled to institute proceedings under Article 126(2) in respect of an infringement

at a certain point in time, the filing of an appeal or an application for relief, whether

administrative or judicial does not in any way prevent or interrupt the operation of

the time limit. Thus, a person aggrieved by an unlawful arrest may institute Civil

proceedings for damages for wrongful arrest or complain to the Ombudsmen,

under Article 156. If he is unsuccessful, in that his action or complaint is dismissed,

he cannot claim that the computation of time for the purposes of a subsequent

petition under Article 126(2) commences from the date of such dismissal. That

example relates to a judicial or constitutional remedy; the position of an aggrieved

person can hardly be better if he opted to pursue an administrative remedy. The

Constitution provides for a sure and expeditious remedy. In the highest Court, to

be granted according to law, and not subject to the uncertain discretion of the very

executive of whose act the aggrieved person complains; if he decides to pursue

other remedies, particularly administrative remedies, the lapse of time will (save in

very exceptional circumstances) result in the former remedy becoming unavailable

to him”. [Emphasis Added]

14

Moreover, at page 397, it was held:

“… An aggrieved person who chooses not to pursue his constitutional remedy, and

later finds that other remedies are of no avail, can grant himself an extension of

time, by the simple device of filing yet another appeal; if he had previously appealed

only to the Secretary to the Ministry, he will appeal to the Minister; or from the

Minister, to the Prime Minister; and then to the President; or he will make a second

or a third appeal, before ultimately deciding to petition this Court. Article 126

neither permits, nor was intended to permit, such a course of action: on the

contrary, the remedy under Article 126 must be availed of at the earliest possible

opportunity, within the prescribed times, and if not so availed of, the remedy ceases

to be available”. [Emphasis Added]

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the petitioner became aware that her alleged

Fundamental Rights were violated at least on the 08th of September, 2006, when the declaration

under section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was published. Thereafter, she had been seeking

administrative relief to resolve her alleged grievances relating to her house, the appurtenant

land and alleged servitude rights for a period of two and half years from the publication of the

said declaration. The instant application had been filed after exhausting all the other remedies

available to the petitioner including resorting to judicial remedies.

The said Court of Appeal judgment states that the Counsel for the petitioner moves to withdraw

the application with liberty to file fresh application with additional documents. However, in

such an instance, a party who had withdrawn an application is bound to comply with the

mandatory time frames stipulated by law. As such, the one-month time limit stipulated in

Article 126(2) will be computed from the date of the alleged infringement or imminent

infringement of the Fundamental Right.

Hence, the time spent by the petitioner in seeking administrative reliefs and other judicial

remedies cannot be excluded from the computation of the one-month time limit stipulated in

Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the petitioner has not invoked the jurisdiction of

this court by filing the petition within one month of the alleged infringement of her

Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution and thus, the petition should

be dismissed.

15

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the application is dismissed with Rs. 50,000/- as

costs to be paid to the State.
