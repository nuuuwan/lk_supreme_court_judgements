Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Gampaha

seeking to partition among himself and the 1st to 11th

Defendants a land named Wawe Ethana in extent of 1 acre and

3 roods, bounded on the North by the land of Thepanis Appu

and others, on the East by the land of Thepanis Appu, on the

South by the land of Romanis Appu, and on the West by the

land belonging to the successors in title of Mudlier Silva.

Upon the death of the original Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant took

over as the substituted Plaintiff. The commission to prepare the

Preliminary Plan, which is the first step to identifying the land to

be partitioned, was sent to the Surveyor who returned the

commission duly executed with Plan No. 5733 and the Report.

In the Report, the Surveyor states inter alia that the substituted

Plaintiff and the 2nd to 7th, 9th and 10th Defendants were present

at the survey, and the boundaries of the land were shown to him

by the substituted Plaintiff and no other party raised objections

by stating that the boundaries shown were wrong. The extent of

the land depicted in this Plan is 2 acres and 25.5 perches.

The land is described in the schedule to the plaint in accordance

with old title Deeds executed many decades ago. This includes

title Deed No. 15355 executed in 1925. The extent of the land

given in these Deeds is speculative. There were no Plans

prepared at that time. Hence, a discrepancy of 1 rood and 25.5

perches between the land described in the old Deeds and the

land shown in the more recently prepared Plan cannot be taken

to mean a larger land than that sought to be partitioned was

surveyed. No party raised such a point at the survey or

thereafter.

8

The trial commenced on 18.05.2001 with the raising of issues

and the substituted Plaintiff partly gave evidence. The 1st issue

raised by the substituted Plaintiff was whether the land to be

partitioned is depicted in Plan No. 5733. The substituted

Plaintiff marked Plan No. 5733 as the Preliminary Plan depicting

the land to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the

plaint.

Conversely, the contesting 3(a) Defendant raised the issue

whether the land depicted in Plan No. 5733 is not Wawe Ethana

but a different land named Meegahahena alias Midellagahawatta

as described in the statement of claim of the said Defendant.

According to this Defendant, Meegahahena alias

Midellagahawatta is a land of 2 acres, 2 roods and 15 perches in

extent.

The substituted Plaintiff continued her evidence-in-chief on

18.06.2002 and 08.11.2002. During the course of her evidence,

she stated inter alia that the land is known as Wewe Watta,

Wawe Ethana, and Millagahawatta.

However, before the commencement of her cross examination,

the substituted Plaintiff made an application to amend the

plaint. An amended plaint was filed on 06.01.2005. The

substituted Plaintiff thereafter moved the Court to issue a

commission to prepare a new Preliminary Plan. The issuance of

a fresh commission to prepare a new Preliminary Plan was

unnecessary because there was no change in the schedule to the

amended plaint as to the land to be partitioned. The schedules

to the original plaint and the amended plaint are the same.

9

The new commission was issued to a different Surveyor who

sent to Court Plan No. 2256 with the Report. In this second

Plan, i.e. Plan No. 2256, a portion of the land on the southern

boundary of about 2 roods in extent is excluded and a land of 1

acre, 2 roods and 22.25 perches is depicted. The Surveyor

states in the Report that in the commission he received, he was

directed to survey the land and prepare the Plan in the manner

shown by the substituted Plaintiff, and therefore the survey was

done according to the boundaries shown by the substituted

Plaintiff. The Surveyor specifically points out that there is no

identifiable southern boundary. In this Plan, the southern

boundary is shown by a straight line drawn by the Surveyor and

the southern boundary is described as part of Wawe Ethana

claimed by the substituted Plaintiff. It may be recalled that the

original Plaintiff filed this action to partition the land known as

Wawe Ethana. The Surveyor has in effect excluded a part of

Wawe Ethana on the request of the substituted Plaintiff.

With this new development, the trial commenced de novo and

issues were raised afresh by the substituted Plaintiff inter alia

on the basis that the land to be partitioned is depicted in new

Plan No. 2256. The substituted Plaintiff gave evidence again

and Plan No. 2256 was marked as the Preliminary Plan but

subject to proof. Nevertheless, the Surveyor was not called to

give evidence.

Thereafter, the 5th Defendant was added as the substituted

Plaintiff on the basis that the 1st Defendant, who was initially

substituted as the Plaintiff, did not prosecute the case with due

diligence.

10

With the evidence of the new substituted Plaintiff (i.e. the 5th

Defendant), the Plaintiff’s case was closed, reading in evidence

Deeds marked P1-P5. At the time of the closure of the Plaintiff’s

case, the contesting 3(a) Defendant informed Court that Plan No.

2256 marked subject to proof had not been proved by calling the

Surveyor. Thereafter the 3(a) Defendant and the 13th Defendant

gave evidence.

P1 of 1967 refers to a land known as Wewe Watta in extent of 1

acre and 3 roods. P2 of 1991 refers to a land known as Wawe

Ethana in extent of 1 acre and 3 roods. P3 of 1991 refers to a

land known as Wawe Ethana in extent of 1 acre and 3 roods. P4

of 1925 refers to a land known as Millagahawatta alias Wewe

Watta in extent of 1 acre and 2 roods. P5 of 1970 refers to a

land known as Millagahawatta in extent of 1 acre and 3 roods.

The learned District Judge by his Judgment dated 30.06.2010

dismissed the Plaintiff’s action on the basis that the Plaintiff

failed to properly identify the corpus.

Apart from the arbitrary removal of a part of the corpus, the

learned District Judge says that the boundaries in the schedule

to the plaint do not correspond with the boundaries depicted in

Plan No. 2256.

The boundaries in the schedule to the plaint are given in

accordance with the boundaries in old Deeds. Such boundaries

are likely to have changed with the passage of time and,

moreover, the existing boundaries have been identified by the

Surveyor by the names of the owners of the adjoining lands. If

the change in the names of the owners of the adjoining lands

can be explained, a District Judge cannot dismiss a partition

11

action by making a superficial comparison of the boundaries in

the schedule to the plaint with the existing boundaries as stated

in the Preliminary Plan. No such explanation was given by the

substituted plaintiff in this case. The substituted Plaintiff’s

evidence on the identification of the corpus as well as the

pedigree was fragile.

On appeal by the substituted Plaintiff, the High Court of Civil

Appeal by Judgment dated 02.07.2015 set aside the Judgment

of the District Court and directed the District Judge to partition

the land depicted in Plan No. 2256 according to the pedigree of

the substituted Plaintiff.

It is against this Judgment of the High Court that the 3(a)

Defendant has come before this Court. This Court granted leave

to appeal on the questions of identification of the corpus, failure

to investigate title to the land, and the prescriptive claim of the

3rd Defendant.

The brief Judgment of the High Court conspicuously lacks an

analysis of evidence when it held with the Plaintiff on the

identification of the corpus and the title to the land.

Although it was Plan No. 2256 which was marked subject to

proof but not proved, the High Court states it was Plan No. 5733

which was marked subject to proof but not proved. Such was

the care taken by the High Court in deciding the appeal.

It is abundantly clear from the Surveyor’s Report on Plan No.

2256 that the Surveyor was compelled to exclude a part of Wawe

Ethana, the land for the partition of which alone the original

Plaintiff filed this action, at the instance of the substituted

Plaintiff. The Surveyor had to yield to the substituted Plaintiff’s

12

request because of the direction given to him by Court in the

commission.

It may be recalled that it is the same substituted Plaintiff who

showed the boundaries to the Surveyor who prepared the

previous Plan No. 5733. No reasons were given by the

substituted Plaintiff at the survey or in evidence for the change

of mind.

However, the High Court in its Judgment states that in the first

Plan, i.e. Plan No. 5733, a larger land is depicted and the reason

for this may be the filling of the paddy field on the southern

boundary. But no such evidence was given by the substituted

Plaintiff at the trial and I am at a loss to understand how the

High Court formulated such a defence to justify the arbitrary

removal of a portion of the land from partitioning.

The High Court referring to Plan No. 5733 further states that if a

larger land is made the subject matter of the action than what is

stated in the schedule to the plaint, a land in excess of the

registered lis pendens would need to be partitioned, which is

unlawful. I am unable to understand this reasoning. This is not

a question of enlarging the corpus but a question of identifying

the corpus. The proper identification of the land described in

the schedule to the plaint on the ground does not necessitate a

fresh lis pendens being registered. Nor does it amount to

partitioning a larger land not covered by the lis pendens

presently registered.

Without analysing the evidence as to proof of pedigree, the High

Court directed the District Court to enter a partition decree as

prayed for by the Plaintiff in the amended plaint. This cannot be

13

done in a partition case. The District Judge did not engage in

investigating the title to the land because he formed the opinion

that the land to be partitioned had not been properly identified.

The High Court did not consider the contest raised by the 3rd

Defendant at all.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court need not

consider the contest raised by the 3(a) Defendant. The Court

can dismiss the Plaintiff’s action without considering the said

contest.

A partition action cannot be filed to partition a portion of the

land. The entire land should be brought into the action and the

co-owners of the whole corpus should be made parties. If the

land to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint

has not been properly identified, the Plaintiff’s action shall fail.

In such a situation the necessity to investigate title does not

arise. Title shall be investigated on a properly identified parcel of

land. The Court shall not first investigate title and then look for

the land to be partitioned. It shall happen vice versa. (Peris v.

Peris (1903) 6 NLR 321, Abeysinghe v. Abeysinghe (1946) 47 NLR

509, Girigoris Appuhamy v. Maria Nona (1956) 60 NLR 330)

The Plaintiff in this case has failed to bring the whole land into

the action. In other words, the Plaintiff has failed to properly

identify the land to be partitioned. Hence the Plaintiff’s action

shall fail.

The questions of law raised before this Court are answered in

favour of the 3(a) Defendant-Appellant.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court and restore the

Judgment of the District Court. The appeal of the 3rd Defendant

is allowed with costs.
