S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The 1st Petitioner, N.K. Sooriyabandara (Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) has

made the instant application seeking relief in respect of the infringement of his

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under and in terms of the Constitution, in the manner

hereinafter more fully set out, against the Respondents.

The 1st Respondent is the University of Peradeniya (hereinafter referred to as the

University), the 2nd Respondent is Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake; the Vice Chancellor of the

University and the 3rd Respondent is the Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University. The 4th-

30th Respondents are parties affiliated with the University, 31st Respondent is the

University Grants Commission and the 32nd Respondent is the Hon. Attorney General.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 23

The Petitioners instituted an action at the Supreme Court under Article 126 of the

Constitution, through Petition dated 3rd March 2016 against the Respondents claiming

that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as guaranteed by Article 12(1) and Article

14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been infringed by the Respondents and further

requesting for interim relief suspending the letter of termination of services of the

Petitioner as contained in the document marked P12 and interim relief restraining the

Respondents from evicting the Petitioner from staff quarters until the final determination

of the instant case.

The Court was inclined to grant Leave to Proceed for the alleged violation of Article

12(1) of the Constitution. Additionally, the University was agreeable to give an

undertaking that they would maintain the status quo to the extent of permitting the

Petitioner to remain in the quarters until the final determination of the instant case, which

was further extended on the grounds that the Petitioner would pay rent for the same.

The Facts

The Petitioner had joined the University as a Marshal Grade II in September of 2007.

Thereafter, the University had published an advertisement internally for the post of Chief

Security Officer (CSO) Grade II on the 26th of November 2012 in accordance with the

scheme of recruitment. The University received authorization to advertise this post by the

University Grants Commission (UGC) by the Commission Circular No.160 dated 26th

February 1982, which authorized each University to advertise, hold interviews and to make

recommendations to the Commission for the appointments to all posts coming within the

purview of Section 71(2)(ii) of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978 (hereinafter referred to

as the Universities Act) , excluding those posts referred to in paragraph (1) of the circular.

Pursuant to the said advertisement, the Petitioner and another applicant were called

for an interview on the 26th of April 2013 before a selection committee appointed by the

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 23

University Council of the 1st Respondent. However, since neither candidate had performed

satisfactorily at the interview, the University had decided to give the Petitioner an acting

appointment for a period of 3 months with effect from 15th May 2013.

The selection committee was reconvened in October 2013 to reconsider the

qualifications and the experience of the two short listed candidates in order to

recommend one of them for a permanent post. At the said meeting, the selection

committee had decided to recommend the Petitioner to the Council for the post of Chief

Security Officer, initially on an acting basis for a period of 3 months, and on satisfactory

completion of the same to appoint him on a permanent basis subject to probationary

period of 1 year. This recommendation had thereafter been approved by the Council.

The Petitioners acting appointment was thereafter extended for a further 3 months,

subsequent to which the Petitioner was appointed by the UGC to the post of Chief Security

Officer by letter dated 24th August 2014, subject to a probationary period of one year in

terms of Section 71(2)(ii) of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978.

The Petitioner functioned in the post of CSO at the University from 15th September

2014 to 3rd March 2015. However, the University had received the following complaints

relating to the conduct of the Petitioner as the CSO whilst on probation:

a) Complaint by the Students Union, University of Peradeniya dated 23rd January 2015

b) Complaint by the Proctor of the University of Peradeniya dated 26th January 2015

c) Complaint by Director, Physical Education dated 5th February 2015

d) Complaint by Federation of Peradeniya University Teachers Associations (FPUTA)

dated 12th February 2015

e) Complaint by residents Mawalawatta dated 23rd October 2014 regarding the

indiscipline of the security officers under the control of the Petitioner.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 23

The Respondents submit that the complaint made by the FPUTA, which is the parent

association comprising of all the academics attached to the University of Peradeniya, was

tabled before the Council of the University on the 28th of February 2015, where it was

decided to send the Petitioner on compulsory leave with full pay pending a preliminary

investigation.

As per the Respondents, the Council had thereafter appointed a 3-member

committee on 9th May 2015 in order to conduct a preliminary inquiry in connection with

the complaints received against the Petitioner. However, the committee could not

convene due to prior commitments of two members. As one member, namely Dr. Sugath

Gunasekara was reluctant to continue as a member of the panel due to his belief that the

investigation should only be conducted by a single member from the staff of the

University and not a panel, Professor R.L. Wijeyaweera (hereinafter referred to as the 29th

Respondent) was appointed in his place to avoid further delay.

The Committee had thereafter convened for the first time on 6th of August 2015 and

had recorded several statements including one from the Petitioner in connection with the

complaint lodged by FPUTA on the 12th of February 2015. As per the Respondent all the

documents made available to the committee during the investigation including

statements made by the witnesses were made available to the Petitioner and the

Petitioner was given the opportunity to place his response to the same including the

complaints that had been made against him, both orally and in writing.

Further, The Petitioners probation was also extended to facilitate the preliminary

inquiry. Upon completion of the inquiry, the Committee had submitted its report dated

19th November 2015 to the Council of the University along with all the statements

recorded and other evidence, including those submitted by the Petitioner.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 23

As per the Respondent, the Committee had made the following findings with regard

to the complaints made by FPUTA:

(A) The Petitioner allowed outsiders to use the University pool without approval,

during hours when the pool was closed.

i. The Petitioner had not obtained prior approval from the Director,

Department of Physical Education to have the pool opened and used by

some school children on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of February 2015;

ii. The Petitioner had without any authorization used a key at the Chief

Security Office and had opened the pool premises and allowed outsiders

to use the pool despite objections from the security in charge of the pool;

iii. The Petitioner had allowed outsiders to use the pool on the 2nd of

February 2015 from 6.50 pm to 8.45 pm, when the pool was closed as the

pool did not possess sufficient lighting to permit night-time swimming;

iv. The Petitioner had transferred the security officer on duty at the Pool on

the 3rd of February 2015 to the Department of Management Studies;

v. The Petitioner had thereafter opened the pool on 3rd and 4th of February

2015, which were two public holidays without any approval and had

allowed school children to use the pool, without the presence of pool

attendants and lifeguards;

vi. The Petitioner had also caused a loss of Rs. 26,000 by permitting outsiders

to use the Pool without proper payment to the University.

(B) The Petitioner had inspected Room No.26 at the Arunachalam Hall in the night of

the 5th of November 2014 without following the establishment procedure

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 23

i. The Petitioner had admitted that he was aware that the procedure to be

followed prior to entering a student room was that the Warden and/or the

Proctor should be informed, and in their absence the Sub Warden should

be informed, and the search party should comprise a Marshal and/or the

Proctor or Deputy Proctor and the resident sub-Warden;

ii. The Petitioner admitted that he had failed to inform any of the said

persons and instead had entered Room No.26 on the 5th of November

2014 along with 6 other security officers at 2am, with prior notice to the

Deputy Vice Chancellor;

iii. The Deputy Vice Chancellor thereafter confirmed that he had not

authorized the Petitioner to inspect Room No.26 in the Arunachalam Hall

in the contravention of the established procedure.

(C) The Petitioner had brought disrepute to Prof. K. Samarasinghe, Chairman of the

Staff Residence Committee at the 118th meeting held on the 14th of November

2014.

(D) The Petitioner had been cautioned on several occasions with regard to his

unsatisfactory conduct Chief Security Officer.

(E) The Petitioner had failed to maintain discipline among the security officers under

his charge as evidenced by the complaints received from residents of

Mawalawatta.

(F) The Petitioner had taken 30 university cloaks on the false pretext of being

required for a function at the Dental Faculty.

Accordingly, the Report of the Committee revealed that the complaints made by the

FPUTA against the Petitioner were true and were of a very serious nature and the

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 23

Committee recommended that the Petitioner should not be confirmed in the post of CSO.

This report had thereafter been tabled before the Council on 28th November 2015, which

had unanimously decided not to confirm the Petitioner in the post of CSO and accordingly

to terminate his services with effect from 28th November 2015 under Section 21:3:1 of

Chapter III and Section 6:1 of chapter V of the Establishments Code of the University

Grants Commission and higher Educational Institutions.

The decision of the Council had been forwarded to the UGC by letter dated 14th

December 2016 for its approval to terminate the services of the Petitioner who was still

on probation at the time. In response to the said letter the UGC had informed the

University by a letter dated 20th January 2016 that the concurrence of the UGC was not

required and that the Council of the University was vested with the authority to terminate

the services of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner had finally been informed of the termination of his services by letter

dated 10th of February 2016 titled Termination of service informing him that the

Governing Council has decided in its 448th meeting held on 28th November 2015 that

subsequent to the findings of the Fact Finding Committee it was unanimously decided to

not confirm him in the position of CSO and to terminate his services with effect from 28th

November 2015 under Section 21:3:1 of Chapter III and Section 6:1 of Chapter V of the

University Establishment Code of UGC and HEIs.

At this juncture, I find it pertinent to establish the facts as submitted by the Petitioner

by the Petition dated 3rd March 2016.

The Petitioner states that during the time period the Petitioner functioned in the post

of CSO from 15th September 2015 to 3rd March 2016, he had not received any complaints

regarding his performance. The Petitioner states that he later came to know that the

Governing Council had decided to hold a preliminary investigation in February 2015 in

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 23

respect of the alleged abuse of power by the Petitioner consequent to the complaint

made by the FPUTA and that a committee comprising of the 28th, 29th and 30th

Respondents were thereafter appointed by the Council for the purpose of this

investigation.

The Petitioner states that he had been informed by letter dated 3rd March 2015 that

he had been sent on compulsory leave with immediate effect and that a preliminary

inquiry would be held in respect of the allegations. The Petitioner further submits that the

Respondents failed to hold an inquiry for two months after placing the Petitioner on

compulsory leave. The Petitioner states that he complained to the 2nd Respondent by a

letter dated 4th May 2015 regarding the failure to record a statement from the Petitioner

for a period of two months and had requested for the inquiry to take place at the earliest

possible date. The letter also expresses his concern that should the inquiry be further

delayed it would exhaust his leave entitlement and compel him to go on no pay leave.

Subsequently, the Petitioner had been given notice by letter dated 17th September

2015 that the probation period was extended until 14th September 2016 under Section

21:1:5 of Chapter III of University Establishment Code, pending the decision of the

preliminary inquiry. The Petitioner states that he had neither been warned nor informed

of any shortcomings in respect of discharging the duties of the post of CSO.

The Petitioner states that he was asked to appear before the aforementioned

Preliminary Investigation Committee in person on 30th September 2015 after lapse of over

6 months from the date of sending the Petitioner on compulsory leave. The Petitioner

states that he objected to the 29th Respondent, however, the 28th Respondent had

rejected the said objection and proceeded with the inquiry. The Petitioner further submits

that the 29th Respondent conducted himself in a very aggressive manner and even

threatened the Petitioner during the proceedings of the said Committee. The Petitioner

states that he had written to the 2nd Respondent informing him of the unsatisfactory

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 23

manner in which the Preliminary Investigation had been conducted and requested the

tape recordings of the proceedings to be preserved.

The Petitioner states that after examining the documents that established the alleged

charges against the Petitioner, which were in the possession of the said Committee, he

had requested another opportunity to make oral representation before the aforesaid

Committee. This request had been rejected and he was directed to tender written

submissions by letter dated 13th October 2015 which states that the Petitioner may

examine all relevant document on prearranged date and time prior to the 20th October

2015 and that he may further submit any facts or evidence before the 27th of October,

which will be taken into account by the Committee. In response to the Petitioners request

to make further submissions before the Committee, he was informed by letter dated 16th

October that he may make submissions to the Committee in written form prior to the 27th

of October. Accordingly, the Petitioner had filed written submissions on 25th October

2015.

The Petitioner states that he later came to know he was found guilty of all charges

which were reproduced above. However, the Petitioner states that the charge F regarding

the taking of 30 cloaks stating that it is to be used at a function to be held at the Dental

Faculty was not a charge levelled against him and as such, he could not place any material

before the Committee to prove his innocence.

The Petitioner states that his salary for the month of December was suspended without

any notice and when he had requested for the same, he was informed by Bursars letter

dated 18th January 2016 that the Petitioners salary was suspended with effect from 28th

November 2015 consequent to the letter received from the Non-Academic

Establishments, which letter had not been annexed to the same.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 23

The Petitioner had thereafter requested the 2nd Respondent to inform him of the

reasons for the suspension of salary whereby the Petitioner was informed by the 2nd

Respondent that the Governing Council had decided to terminate the services of the

Petitioner based on the findings and recommendations of the Fact-Finding Committee

with effect from 28th November 2015 under the relevant provisions of the UGC

Establishment Code.

The Petitioner further states that as the preliminary inquiry included the 29th

Respondent who was a member of the FPUTA that made the purported allegations, it

violates rules of natural justice. The Petitioner also states that as the Petitioner was

appointed as CSO by the UGC, the Governing Council lacks the authority to terminate his

services. Based on the above submissions, the Petitioner claims that his Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been

violated.

Validity of the decision to terminate services

In deciding upon the merits of this case, I find it pertinent to examine the first matter

of contention which is the claim by the Petitioner that the Governing Council does not

have the authority to terminate the services of the Petitioner as the Petitioner was

promoted to the position of CSO by the UGC. I find that this matter has been addressed

by the evidence presented to this Court in the form of the letter dated 20th January 2016

sent by the UGC in response to the decision of the Governing Council to terminate the

services by the Petitioner. The relevant portion of the letter has been reproduced below

for ease of reference:

This is in reference to your letter dated 14.1.2015 seeking concurrence of the

UGC to terminate the services of Mr. N K Sooriyabandara, Chief Security

Officer attached to your University.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 23

In this regard, I would like to draw your kind attention to the direction laid

down in the 2nd proviso of Section 75 of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978,

the Governing Authority has the power over holder of any post at its

employment at any time be suspended, dismissed or compulsory retired. On

the other hand, in terms of Section 45(2)(xii), the Council can suspend, dismiss

or otherwise punish persons in the employment of a University.

Therefore, concurrence of the UGC is not needed to be acquired in the case of

Mr. N K Sooriyabandara Chief Security Officer since the Council, University of

Peradeniya is vested with the required authority

For the purposes of determining the validity of the dismissal of the Petitioner, the relevant

sections of the Universities Act must be examined. Section 75 concerns the retirement of

persons other than teachers. In terms of suspension or dismissal of such persons,

subsection 2 states as follows:

(a) the Commission or the governing authority of any Higher Educational

Institution to which the holder of such post is attached or in the case

where such person is attached to a Higher Educational Institute, the governing

authority of the Higher Educational Institution to which such institute is

affiliated may based on the recommendations of the Institute suspend

the holder of such post pending an inquiry by the Commission or such

governing authority or the Institute, as the case may be, for misconduct,

inefficiency or dereliction of duty; or

(b) where such holder of post is found guilty after such inquiry, the

Commission, the governing authority of the Higher Educational

Institution to which such person is attached or in the case where such

person is attached to a Higher Educational Institute, the governing authority

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 23

of the Higher Educational Institution to which such Institute is affiliated, as

the case may be, may on resolution adopted by the Commission or the

governing authority of the relevant Higher Educational Institution,

dismiss or compulsorily retire the holder of such post.

(Emphasis added)

In addition to the above, Section 45 of the Universities Act specifies the powers of a

Council of a University and includes in Section 45(2) that a Council may exercise, perform,

and discharge the powers, duties and functions pertaining to specific matters, including

the following:

(xii) to appoint persons to, and to suspend, dismiss or otherwise punish

persons in the employment of, the University:

Based on the above, The Governing Council of the University as the governing authority

is indeed authorized to suspend, investigate, and terminate services of the Petitioner. As

such, the University has followed an extra step of reaching out to the 30th Respondent for

the termination of the services of the Petitioner.

I must also note that it is unreasonable to expect the UGC to intervene in all matters

regarding dismissal of all employees of universities. It is impractical given the sheer

number of persons employed by universities around the country and it would be an

extremely inefficient mechanism that also undermines the authority exercised by each

individual university over their respective employees. Considering all, the response of the

UGC is correct according to the law applicable.

This was evidenced by Order of the Court of Appeal of case K.G. Eranda Wijesiri v

University of Kelaniya CA/WRIT/App No.756/2007 in minutes dated 15.10.2010, in

which a similar matter concerning a petitioner who was attached to the University of

Kelaniya in the position of CSO. The university conducted a preliminary investigation

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 23

following which the university decided to interdict the petitioner of said case. The

petitioner sought a writ of certiorari quashing the relevant charge sheets and prohibiting

the proceedings of the disciplinary inquiry. In addressing the petitioners challenge that

the university was not the disciplinary authority upon whom the power to terminate his

services was vested, the Court of Appeal assessed Section 8(1), Section 45(2)(i)(ix), Section

71(2) and Section 75, all of which are relevant to the instant case. The Learned Justice S.

Sriskandarajah came to the conclusion that when an officer is attached to a Higher

Educational Institution, the governing authority of said Institution has the power to deal

with the officer on disciplinary matters.

Upon perusal of the above case, I find that in the instant case I am of the same view

as the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in the above case, following careful

examination of the same provisions pertaining to the specific circumstances of the instant

case.

I am of the view that the above explanation sufficiently addresses the concern in

confirming that the Governing Council was vested with the authority to come to the

decision of terminating the services of the Petitioner

Violation of Rules of Natural Justice

While the Governing Council of the University is vested with the authority to conduct

an inquiry and to terminate the services of the Petitioner, the exact manner in which the

inquiry was conducted must be examined due to the concerns raised by the Petitioner. In

terms of the inclusion of the 29th Respondent as a member of the Committee, the

Petitioner raised the concern that the principles of Natural Justice have been violated. This

is given that the 29th Respondent is a member of the FPUTA, which is the party that

requested for a disciplinary inquiry in respect of alleged abuse of power by the Petitioner.

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 23

In assessing the Report of the Fact-Finding Committee (annexed as P9 of the record),

the Committee seems to have considered witness statements and available records in

coming to a unanimous decision. The Report recommends that the petitioner should not

be confirmed in the post of CSO. It must be further noted that the Governing Council, in

arriving at the decision to terminate the Services of the Petitioner at its 448th Meeting (the

minutes of which has been annexed as 1R14 of the record), has referred exclusively to

the report of the fact-finding committee and the recommendations available in the same.

As the sole consideration in the decision to terminate the services of the Petitioner

was based on the findings of the Fact-Finding Committee, I find it pertinent to examine

whether the rules of Natural Justice have been violated by the inclusion of the 29th

Respondent as one of the Committee members.

As expounded upon in the case of R. v. St Edmundsbury BC ex p. Investors in

Industry Commercial Properties Ltd. (1985) 1 WLR 1168, it is an accepted fact that in

terms of administrative decision, a standard of bias similar to that of judicial decisions

must be followed.

This Court recognizes that personal relationships, business interests, political

affiliations may give rise to reasonable suspicion or a real danger of bias. The standard

required of bias in situations similar to that of the instant case can be found upon

examination of Allison v. General Council of Medical Education and Registration

(1894) 1 QB 750 which referred to the decision given in Leeson v Council of Medical

Education and Registration [1889] 43 Ch D 366.

In determining bias, the test that is presently applicable is the real likelihood test which

is based on the operative principle that justice must not only be done but must be seen

to be done. In R. v. Gough (1993) 2 All ER 724 Lord Goff held as follows

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 23

I think it is possible, and desirable, that the same test should be applicable in

all cases of apparent bias, whether concerned with justices or other members

of inferior tribunals, or with jurors, or with arbitratorsFurthermore, I think

it unnecessary, in formulating the appropriate test, to require that the

court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man,

because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man;

and in any event the court has first to ascertain the relevant circumstances

from the available evidence, knowledge of which would not necessarily be

available to an observer in court at the relevant time. Finally, for the

avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of real danger

rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking in terms

of possibility rather than probability of bias. Accordingly, having

ascertained the relevant circumstances, there was a real danger of bias on the

part of the relevant member of the tribunal in question, in the sense that he

might unfairly be regarded (or have unfairly regarded) with favour, or

disfavor, the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him.

(Emphasis added)

In this case Lord Goff also held that,

it is not necessary that actual bias should be provedthe inquiry is directed

to the question whether there was such a degree of possibility of bias on the

part of the tribunal that the court will not allow the decision to stand.

In furthering the above, the Court of Appeal case of Re Medicaments and Related

Classes of Goods (No. 2) (2001) 1 WLR 700, states as follows:

The court must first ascertain all the circumstances which have a bearing on

the suggestion that the judge was biased. It must then ask whether those

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 23

circumstances would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude

that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, the two being the same, that

the tribunal was biased.

This reformulation of the test in R. v. Gough was approved by the House of Lords in

Porter v. Magill (2002) 2 AC 357.

In applying the above views to the instant case, It is my view that in terms of assessing

bias based on personal interest, it is apparent that the 29th Respondent has no pecuniary

interest in this matter. Nevertheless, this Court recognizes that personal relationships,

business interests, political affiliations may give rise to reasonable suspicion or a real

danger of bias. As was understood in the case of Allison v General Council of Medical

Education and Registration, not all such affiliations lead to the same conclusion. In this

case, the Court of Appeal of England considered the fact that the member in question

had resigned from the organization 2 months prior to the complaint having been made

in deciding that there was no such danger of bias. However, in the present dispute, the

29th Respondent continued as a member of the FPUTA throughout the period of the

inquiry.

While this does not amount to actual bias, the circumstances as it stands does not aid

the appearance of justice being done as it may indicate a danger of bias on the part of

the 29th Respondent. However, I am in no means disregarding the severity of the

allegations levelled against the Petitioner and the fact that the Petitioner was acting in

the capacity of a probationer.

Decision

While it is not contested that the Respondent is entitled to terminate the services of

the Petitioner during the probationary period, based on the consideration above, it is

apparent that the decision by the Respondents is based on the inquiry by the Preliminary

SC FR 79/2016 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 23

investigation committee. As enumerated above I am of the view that the manner in which

the inquiry was conducted is in contravention with rules of Natural Justice.

As such, upon careful examination of all relevant facts and circumstances of the instant

case, I declare the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of

the Constitution have been infringed. I further declare that the termination of services of

the Petitioner as contained in P12 is null and void and has no force or avail in law.

However, considering the nature of the gravity of the allegations against the Petitioner,

the Respondents are free to take appropriate action. I order no costs.

Application allowed.
