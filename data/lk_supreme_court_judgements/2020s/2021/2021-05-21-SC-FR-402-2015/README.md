The Petitioner filed this application under Article 126 of the

Constitution seeking inter alia a declaration that his

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11 and/or 12(1)

and/or 13(1) and/or 13(2) and/or 13(5) of the Constitution were

infringed by the 1st to 3rd Respondents; compensation in a sum

of Rs. 1 million from the State and Rs. 3 million from the 1st

Respondent; and a direction to the 5th Respondent Attorney-

General to institute criminal proceedings under the Convention

against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994, against the 1st

Respondent and the other police officers liable for the

infringement of the Petitioner’s fundamental rights under Article

11 of the Constitution.

3

The Petitioner’s complaint is that he was subjected to torture,

cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the 1st Respondent

and two others whilst he was under arrest and detained in the

police cell of the Mount Lavinia police station.

This Court granted leave to proceed on the alleged violation of

the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11

of the Constitution by the 1st Respondent.

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted

by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948 states:

“No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment.”

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1966

transformed the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of

Human Rights into treaty provisions. Sri Lanka acceded to the

ICCPR on 11.06.1980. Article 7 of the ICCPR provides: “No one

shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment.”

Fundamental rights were first declared and recognised in Sri

Lanka in the Constitution of 1972. Article 18(1)(b) in Chapter VI

under “Fundamental Rights and Freedoms” of the 1972

Constitution declared: “In the Republic of Sri Lanka – no person

shall be deprived of life, liberty or security of person except in

accordance with the law.” Although there was no express

provision guaranteeing freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment, these were deemed to be

included in the said Article. However, this Article was subject to

Article 18(2) and (3) which read as follows:

4

18(2) The exercise and operation of the fundamental rights

and freedoms provided in this Chapter shall be subject to

such restrictions as the law prescribes in the interests of

national unity and integrity, national security, national

economy, public safety, public order, the protection of public

health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms

of others or giving effect to the Principles of State Policy set

out in section 16(3).

(3) All existing law shall operate notwithstanding any

inconsistency with the provisions of subsection (1) of this

section.

Article 11 of the 1978 Constitution, which falls within the

Chapter dealing with “Fundamental Rights”, reads as follows:

No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman

or degrading treatment or punishment.

It is significant to note that Article 11 of the 1978 Constitution is

an entrenched provision with no restrictions whatsoever. The

application of this Article cannot be relaxed even in the interest

of national security.

On 10.12.1984, the General Assembly of the United Nations

adopted the Convention against Torture and other Cruel,

Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This

Convention against torture entered into force on 26.06.1987.

Sri Lanka acceded to this Convention on 03.01.1994, and the

Convention entered into force in Sri Lanka on 02.02.1994. This

Convention requires signatory parties to take measures to end

5

torture within their territorial jurisdiction and to criminalise all

acts of torture.

In Article 1 of this Convention against Torture, the term

“torture” is defined in the following manner:

1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “torture”

means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether

physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for

such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person

information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a

third person has committed or is suspected of having

committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,

or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when

such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or

with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other

person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain

or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to

lawful sanctions.

2. This article is without prejudice to any international

instrument or national legislation which does or may contain

provisions of wider application.

Article 2 thereof reads as follows:

2(1) Each State Party shall take effective legislative,

administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of

torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.

(2) No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a

state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability

6

or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a

justification of torture.

(3) An order from a superior officer or a public authority

may not be invoked as a justification of torture.

The Parliament of Sri Lanka enacted the Convention against

Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or

Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994 to give effect to this Convention.

In the interpretation section of the Act, “torture” is defined in the

identical manner as it is defined in Article 1 of the Convention

against torture.

“torture” with its grammatical variations and cognate

expressions, means any act which causes severe pain,

whether physical or mental, to any other person, being an act

which is―

(a) done for any of the following purposes that is to

say―

(i) obtaining from such other person or a

third person, any information or

confession; or

(ii) punishing such other person for any act

which he or a third person has

committed, or is suspected of having

committed; or

(iii) intimidating or coercing such other

person or a third person; or

(b) done for any reason based on discrimination,

7

and being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the

instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public

officer or other person acting in an official capacity.

What acts constitute “torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment” will depend on the facts and

circumstances of each individual case.

The Petitioner in the present application was 32 years old when

he was arrested by officers of the Mount Lavinia police station

on 17.09.2015 around 5.00 p.m. He was entering his residence

after returning from work. The Petitioner says he was informed

by the police that he would have to be produced before the

Magistrate before 5.30 p.m. on that day. At the time, he was the

Country Manager (Sri Lanka) for the National Tertiary Education

Consortium, which is based in New Zealand. The arrest was

consequent to a warrant issued by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate

upon a bigamy charge based on a complaint made by his former

wife. There had been matrimonial disputes between him and his

former wife which ended up in a divorce, but there had been an

ongoing dispute for the custody and maintenance of their child.

Since he was arrested upon returning from work, the Petitioner

was clad in formal attire. After he was taken to the police

station, he was locked up in the police cell. The police officers

who arrested him signed off from their duties for the day at 6.00

p.m. and the 1st Respondent, SI Nelundeniya, assumed duties as

the officer in charge of the night shift.

The 1st Respondent in his statement of objections says he heard

someone from the cell yelling that he wants to meet the Head

Quarters Inspector (HQI) CI Iddamalgoda. Although the 1st

8

Respondent says this person was screaming obscenities at that

time, I am unable to accept it. According to paragraph 10(h) of

the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner

had demanded that he be taken before the HQI “to tell your HQI

to keep me outside the cell.”

The 1st Respondent admits in his statement of objections that

the Petitioner was “dressed in a white long sleeve shirt, black

trousers and shoes”. He says he “ignored the Petitioner’s

utterances and did politely request the Petitioner to remove his

shoes as it is imperative for any person who has been put into a

cell to remain bare feet [according to Police Department

regulations]” as shoes can be used “to assault a third party

within or outside the cell.”

At paragraph 10 (j)-(l) of the Statement of Objections, the 1st

Respondent recounts what happened when he made that “polite

request”:

The Petitioner suddenly grabbed me by my collar as I was

standing next to the cell and had attempted to kick me

through the bars of the cell. As the Petitioner was still

holding onto my collar and to steady myself I held on to the

bars of the cell when the Petitioner bit hard the second

finger of my left hand which was badly lacerated.

Thereafter I managed to obtain the key to the cell from

Police Sergeant Saman and opened the cell to remove the

Petitioner’s shoes. The Petitioner suddenly lunged forward

struck and or assaulted me on the chest. The police

constable Herath had to intervene to get the 1st Respondent

freed.

9

Thereafter, according to the 1st Respondent, he left the police

station seeking medical attention. He does not speak a single

word about how the Petitioner sustained injuries whilst in the

cell.

To recap, according to the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner, while

inside the cell, held the 1st Respondent (who was outside the

cell) by the collar through the iron bars and attempted to assault

him and bit his finger. Is this probable? For me, it is not.

The 1st Respondent did not tender an affidavit from PC Herath

who seems to be an eyewitness to this incident. Instead, he

tendered two statements – R4 and R5 – from two suspects who

were at the police station.

R4 – a statement given by a female suspect who was under

arrest – contradicts this story when she inter alia says

(translated):

The 1st Respondent first told the Petitioner to remove his

shoes from outside the cell and then went inside the cell

and told the Petitioner to remove his shoes. Thereafter,

there was a noise from inside the cell and then the 1st

Respondent came out of the cell complaining that his finger

was bitten by the Petitioner.

The 1st Respondent at paragraph 8 of his written submission

dated 15.02.2021 tells a different story. There he says that

when the Petitioner held him by the collar and bit his finger

through the iron bars of the cell, he

10

advised the officers who were present to go into the cell and

to remove his [Petitioner’s] shoes. When officers entered the

cell the Petitioner had engaged in a fisticuff with them.

The 1st Respondent did not tender affidavits from these

“officers”.

The Petitioner’s version of events, as stated in the petition, is

that when he requested that he be produced before the 3rd

Respondent HQI, the 1st Respondent became incensed. The

Petitioner may not have made his request politely; he may well

have demanded to be produced before the HQI who was in

charge of the police station to tell his side of the story to get him

released from police custody. At that point, according to the

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent entered the cell using abusive

language and began assaulting the Petitioner. In the process,

the Petitioner says the 1st Respondent held him in a head-lock

position and attempted to strangle him. Unable to breathe, the

Petitioner says he bit the finger of the 1st Respondent to release

himself. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent summoned two persons

dressed in civilian clothing into the cell and all three assaulted

the Petitioner severely. The Petitioner does not know the names

of those two persons. They have not been made parties to the

case.

The 1st Respondent in his statement of objections did not say

that he “advised the officers who were present to go into the cell

and to remove his shoes” and “when officers entered the cell the

Petitioner had engaged in a fisticuff with them.” That is because if

he did, he would have been compelled to name the other officers

involved in assaulting the Petitioner.

11

In the written submissions, the 1st Respondent attempts to

implicate the other two persons (referred to by the Petitioner) as

being responsible for the assault of the Petitioner inside the cell.

In paragraph 12 of the written submission the 1st Respondent

says:

Further the admission by the Petitioner that he was

attacked by two others inside the cell, whom he cannot

identify further substantiates the position that it was not

the Respondent who was involved in attacking him.

Then in paragraph 15 of the written submission, the 1st

Respondent admits that he did not use excessive force to control

the situation, suggesting that some amount of force was in fact

used.

Further it is evident that the provocation was sought by the

Petitioner and not the Respondent in any event Respondent

had refrained from using any excessive force on the

Petitioner.

At the stage of filing written submissions, the 1st Respondent at

least admits that the Petitioner was assaulted inside the cell.

I am more than satisfied that the 1st Respondent together with

two other police officers whom the Petitioner does not identify by

name assaulted the Petitioner inside the cell.

What is the nature of the injuries sustained by the Petitioner?

Before exploring the nature of the injuries sustained by him, let

me first consider the injury caused to the finger of the 1st

Respondent, which the Petitioner admits he inflicted in self-

defence to release himself from strangulation. There are no

12

medical reports tendered by the 1st Respondent regarding the

extent of the injury or treatment taken. The 1st Respondent

produced only a Medico-Legal Examination Form marked R7,

not a Medico-Legal Report (MLR), wherein non-grievous

laceration is noted under injuries. The report does not even state

where the alleged laceration was. The incident took place on

17.09.2015. According to R7, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO)

examined the 1st Respondent on 19.09.2015 at 10.00 a.m.

On the other hand, the Petitioner sustained multiple injuries

from this incident. The Petitioner states in his petition that

around 9.00 p.m. on 17.09.2015, an Attorney-at-Law retained

by his mother came to the Mount Lavinia police station and

upon seeing his condition, requested the Mount Lavinia police to

admit him to hospital.

According to the Bed Head Ticket (BHT) sent by the Director of

the National Hospital of Colombo to this Court, the Petitioner

was admitted to the National Hospital at 2.35 a.m. on

18.09.2015 and was seen by a doctor at 3.00 a.m. On

admission, he had visible injuries. The BHT inter alia states

“cleaning & dressing [the wound/s]”, and “tetanus toxoid”. The

MO/ENT further identifies “traumatic perforation [ruptured

eardrum] + bleeding” in the left ear. Thereafter, the Petitioner

was seen by an MO/ENT at 10.45 a.m., and “traumatic

perforation – blood clot” in the left ear is recorded. On

19.09.2015, the Petitioner was seen by a VS [Visiting Surgeon]

in ward 17 who records: “He has got a L/TM [left tympanic

membrane] perforation with blood on the TM. PTA shows

L/conduction impairment.”

13

On the same day, the Petitioner was seen by the JMO. The MLR

states under injuries:

1. Laceration measuring 3 cm situated over the right cheek.

2. Patient had complained of reduced hearing over the left ear.

He was seen by ENT doctor and noted left ear traumatic

perforation and associated with reduced conduction of left

ear.

3. Tenderness noted over back of left shoulder and back of left

upper chest.

The second injury listed above is classified as a “grievous

injury”.

Thereafter, the Magistrate had visited the hospital and

remanded the Petitioner, and the Petitioner was transferred to

the Prison Hospital on 19.09.2015.

The report sent to this Court by the Chief Medical Officer of the

Prison Hospital inter alia says:

According to history records at Prison Hospital, there were

multiple contusions over the face and body and blood clot at

left ear.

The Petitioner tendered several documents along with his

counter affidavit to show that he sought medical advice from

various doctors for body pain and suffering.

The Police force is responsible for inter alia enforcing the law,

maintaining public order and safety. Hence there is a special

responsibility on the police to uphold and protect the

fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. To say the

least, assaulting a person in police custody is a cowardly act,

14

not a heroic act. A person in police custody is at the mercy of

the police.

Learned Senior State Counsel for the 5th Respondent Attorney-

General states in her brief written submission: “subsequent to

leave being granted, the 1st Respondent was represented by

private counsel”; pursuant to a disciplinary inquiry held upon a

complaint made by the Petitioner to the Inspector General of

Police, “the 1st Respondent had been discharged”; proceedings

have been instituted against the Petitioner in the Magistrate’s

Court of Mount Lavinia “for behaving in an unruly manner and

for obstructing the Respondents from the performance of their

duties”; and “there has been no violation of the fundamental

rights of the Petitioner by the State.” Learned Senior State

Counsel seems to be making a vague attempt to absolve the

State from liability, whilst also indirectly condoning the assault

when she says that the 1st Respondent was discharged at the

disciplinary inquiry.

The protection afforded by Article 126 of the Constitution is

against the infringement of fundamental rights by the State, i.e.

by “executive or administrative action”, through the

instrumentalities and agencies of the State. The State includes

every repository of State power. If the act complained of has

been committed under colour of law or office by the State

official, the State is liable. The relief granted against the violation

of fundamental rights is principally against the State and not

against the individual miscreant, notwithstanding the latter may

also be held responsible in this process. (Mariadas Raj v.

General [1981] 1 Sri LR 406 at 422-430, Vivienne Goonewardena

Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd [2006] 3 Sri LR 113)

In Sudath Silva v. Kodituwakku [1987] 2 Sri LR 119, the

Supreme Court took the view that where the Petitioner

establishes that he was tortured while in police custody, the

State is liable although it was not established which officer

inflicted the injuries. The Supreme Court condemned torture

under police custody in the strongest possible terms at 126-127:

Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no person shall

be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment. It prohibits every person from

inflicting torturesome, cruel or inhuman treatment on

another. It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no

restrictions or limitations whatsoever. Every person in this

country, be he a criminal or not, is entitled to this right to

the fullest content of its guarantee. Constitutional

safeguards are generally directed against the State and its

organs. The police force being an organ of the State is

enjoined by the Constitution to secure and advance this

right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any

manner and under any circumstances. Just as much as this

right is enjoyed by every member of the police force, so is he

prohibited from denying the same to others, irrespective of

their standing, their beliefs or antecedents. It is therefore

the duty of this court to protect and defend this right

jealously to its fullest measure with a view to ensuring that

this right which is declared and intended to be fundamental

is always kept fundamental and that the executive by its

16

action does not reduce it to a mere illusion. This court

cannot, in the discharge of its constitutional duty,

countenance any attempt by any police officer however high

or low, to conceal or distort the truth induced, perhaps, by a

false sense of police solidarity. The facts of this case have

revealed disturbing features regarding third degree

methods adopted by certain police officers on suspects held

in police custody. Such methods can, only be described as

barbaric, savage and inhuman. They are most revolting to

one’s sense of human decency and dignity particularly at

the present time when every endeavour is being made to

promote and protect human rights. Nothing shocks the

conscience of a man so much as the cowardly act of a

delinquent police officer who subjects a helpless suspect in

his charge to depraved and barbarous methods of

treatment within the confines of the very premises in which

he is held in custody. Such action on the part of the police

will only breed contempt for the law and will tend to make

the public lose confidence in the ability of the police to

maintain law and order. The petitioner may be a hard-core

criminal whose tribe deserve no sympathy. But if

constitutional guarantees are to have any meaning or value

in our democratic set up, it is essential that he be not

denied the protection guaranteed by our Constitution.

The case at hand is not a difficult one. I hold that the Petitioner

has succeeded in establishing the infringement of his

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the

Constitution.

17

On a consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances

of this case, I direct that the 1st Respondent shall pay the

Petitioner a sum of Rs. 150,000 as compensation and another

Rs. 25,000 as costs of the application. I direct the State to pay

the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 25,000 as compensation. All

payments shall be made within one calendar month from today.
