    "text": "Now, I would like to consider the decision in Perera & Others V Elisahamy 65 C L W 59 which was delivered by a bench of two judges. It was an appeal over a judgment in a partition action. It appears that no objection was taken to the deed at the time when its contents were first spoken to by the witness. Irrespective of that and section 69 of the Partition Act, Basnayake C J in agreement with de Silva J held that \u2018the fact that its genuineness was impeached rendered formal proof necessary regardless of whether objection was taken or not\u2019 and \u2018a court cannot act on facts which are not proved in the manner prescribed in the Evidence Ordinance\u2019. On a lighter reading of the above decision, one may get the impression that regardless of whether the document or deed was objected to or not when it was first tendered in evidence, it has to be proved according to the provisions in the Evidence Ordinance; if it is a deed, in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance; but a deeper understanding of the facts of the aforesaid case and its decision indicate that it is so necessary to prove according to the provisions of Evidence Ordinance, regardless of whether any objection is raised or not at the time of marking the document or deed, only if the genuineness of the document or deed is impeached by the opposite party. I do not see any conflict between this decision in Perera & Others V Elisahamy and other judgments referred above which indicate that where there is no objection to the document it can be admitted in evidence without further proof in terms of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance. This decision in Perera V Elisahamy only add the condition that if the document is impeached irrespective of whether there is an objection or not it has to be proved in terms of the Evidence Ordinance. Perera V Elisahamy contemplates a situation where the document is impeached or challenged even prior to its marking. Even in Seelawathie Gunasekara V K.W Resanona (Supra) their lordships while arriving at the decision had observed that there was no issue challenging the deed.",

Thirdly, the document or the deed can be challenged by objecting to it under section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code and, if it is a partition action under section 68 of the Partition Law.

In a Criminal Case, namely Robins V Grogan 43 N L R 269, it was held that a document cannot be used in evidence, unless its genuineness has been either admitted or established by proof, which should be given before the document is accepted by court. However, as shown above section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code allows documents, which are not forbidden by law, to be admitted in evidence when there is no objection at the time of tendering it in evidence. As explained above, if the document is challenged or impeached through an issue it still has to be proved according to the Evidence Ordinance.",

    "text": "When a document is objected to it being admitted when it was first tendered in evidence, two questions arise for the court to consider; Firstly, whether the document is authentic, in other words whether it is what the party tendering it represents it to be; Secondly, if it passes the test of authenticity, whether it is legally admissible. Admissibility may be decided on arguments with reference to relevant legal provisions but authenticity has to be decided through the evidence adduced in that regard - vide section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code. If one has to prove the authenticity at the very moment whenever an objection is taken, the court may have to adjourn the recording of the evidence of ongoing witness and allow witnesses to be called to prove the authenticity of the document. If they are not available, the court may have to adjourn the proceedings for the day to give an opportunity to summon witnesses necessary to prove the document. Thus, it makes it expedient to mark a document \u2018subject to proof\u2019 when there is an objection to it and proceed with the ongoing witness. On the other hand, it is always not possible for the opposing counsel to state exactly whether he/she objects or not, since in a civil trial, it is not mandatory for the clients to be present in courts. The counsel may need instructions from his client to object to the document tendered in evidence. One may say, since documents are listed, he can get instructions prior to the trial date, but no one can assume that a fake document with the same description as in the list may not be introduced through a witness. Furthermore, there are occasions where documents are marked with the permission of court as well as by showing to the witness during cross-examination. Hence, in a civil trial, it is necessary for the counsel to get instructions from his client to raise a steady objection to a document. This creates a situation in a civil trial to object to documents tentatively till the counsel gets instructions from his client. Hence, it is conceivable that in a civil trial, certain documents are marked \u2018subject to proof\u2019 tentatively. This make a party to refer or mention those documents when that party intends to close his case to see whether the objections made are carried forward by the opposing party or not. Otherwise, I am not aware of any provision that requires parties to mention the documents marked again at the closure of their case. If the objection is reiterated it is considered as a steady objection and if not, it is considered as a withdrawal or wavier of a tentative objection. If the objection is reiterated, in my view, the party who marked the documents have two options, that is either to show through submissions that further proof is not necessary or it is already proved, or ask permission of court to summon witnesses to prove the documents which are steadily objected",

Though this court is not bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal, it appears that decisions in Hemapala V Abeyratne (supra) and Wijewardena V Ellawala (Supra) which applied the ratio in Jugolinija Boal East to documents which are required by law to be attested had not been brought to the notice of their lordships prior to making that decision. Furthermore, as said before, the application of section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code or the decisions made by superior courts in relation to deeds that were not objected at the time of marking, namely, Seyed Mohommad V Perera (supra), Siyadoris V Danoris(supra) and Seelawathie Gunasekara V K W Resanona(supra), apparently, had not been brought to the notice of their lordships, prior to making the decision in the said Mohamed Naleem Mohamed Ismail V Samsulebbe Hamithu.

In the decision of Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe v Dadallage Mervin Silva & another, there is a reference to the decision in Robins V Grogan(supra) but it is a criminal case which has no application of the aforesaid section 154 or section 68 of the Partition Act. Therefore, I do not incline to follow the decisions in the said Mohamed Naleem Mohamed Ismail V Samsulebbe Hamithu SC Appeal 04/2006 and Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe v Dadallage Mervin Silva & another as they were decided without the opportunity to consider the practical application of the said section 154 and some relevant case laws. As elaborated above I cannot consider Perera V Elisahamy (Supra) as a decision that nullifies the application of ratio in Jugolinija Boal East decision in relation to deeds in general terms but when the deed is impeached or challenged it requires the deed to be proved in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.",
