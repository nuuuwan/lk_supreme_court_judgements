S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner namely, Gurusinghe Senevirathnage Tharindu Priyan Akalanka

(hereinafter referred to as ‘’the Petitioner”) has made the instant application seeking

relief in respect of the infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under and

in terms of the Constitution, in the manner hereinafter more fully set out, against the

1st to 13th Respondents.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents are Sergeants of Police attached to the Circuit

Crime Investigation Division, Anuradhapura. The 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th

Respondents are Police Constables attached to the same unit. The 9th Respondent is

the Chief Inspector attached to the Circuit Crime Investigation Division of

Anuradhapura. The 10th Respondent is the Superintendent of Police of the Circuit

Crime Investigation Division, Anuradhapura. The 11th Respondent is the Deputy

Inspector General of North Central Province, Anuradhapura. The 12th Respondent is

the Inspector General of Police. The 13th Respondent is the Attorney General who has

been made a Respondent in compliance with the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

This matter was supported before this court on 26th July 2018 and leave was

granted under Article 11, 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution. On 26th July 2018, when

this matter was supported for granting of leave, the Petitioner had submitted that he

will be restricting this application to the reliefs prayed for against the 1st, 3rd, 4th and

5th Respondents to this case. On 31st October 2019 the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner submitted that he will not be pursuing the matter against the 4th and 5th

Respondents. Further, as the Petitioner had no objections to release the 4th and 5th

Respondents from the proceedings, they were released from the proceedings

accordingly. Presently, the case is against the 1st and 3rd Respondents.

I find it pertinent to refer to the factual matrix of this application as provided by

the parties in order to ascertain whether the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 11, 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated by

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 15

the 1st and 3rd Respondents. However, as there are substantial disparities between the

narration of facts provided by the parties, I find it necessary to briefly narrate both

positions.

Facts of the case as per the Petitioner

The Petitioner states that on 20th September 2017 a group of men entered the

Petitioner’s residence in a disruptive and disorderly manner while the Petitioner was

asleep. The Petitioner alleges that he was apprehended and manacled without

production of a reason for the arrest. He states that he was subsequently removed

from his residence and taken to the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura.

The Petitioner acknowledged that the group of abovementioned people were assigned

to the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura.

The Petitioner states that he was mercilessly assaulted while being transported

from the Petitioner’s residence to the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura

and interrogated by any one or more or all the 1st - 8th Respondents on whether the

Petitioner had been involved in the theft of a motor bicycle. The Petitioner states that

the Petitioner provided them with the details of one Chanaka Sanoj Akalanka in

Mihinthale as the Petitioner believed that the 1st- 8th Respondents were laboring under

the misapprehension as to the Petitioner’s complicity in the theft of a motor bicycle.

The Petitioner further states that the Petitioner was coerced into conducting himself

in such a fashion due to relentless physical assault on the Petitioner by any one or

more or all the 1st-8th Respondents.

The Petitioner states that the above said Chanaka Sanoj Akalanka was taken

into custody upon the Petitioner’s statement on the same date and assaulted by any

one or more or all the 1st- 8th Respondents. The Petitioner asserted that said Chanaka

Sanoj Akalanka had not been complicit in the purported theft of the motor bicycle and

consequently any one or all 1st-8th Respondents proceeded to assault the Petitioner

ruthlessly until the Petitioner almost collapsed in agony. Thereafter the Petitioner

states that his hands were handcuffed behind his back, and he was taken to Thisa

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 15

Wewa along with aforesaid Chanaka Sanoj Akalanka and two others, viz. Silva and

Suranga.

The Petitioner further states that the Petitioner and aforesaid Chanaka Sanoj

Akalanka, Silva and Suranga were carried into a teak woodland over the Thisa Wewa

embankment where the Petitioner was hung on a teak tree and continuously assaulted

by the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Respondent and other officers of the Circuit Crime

Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura for a period of two hours. The Petitioner states

that he was then brought back to the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura

and was held for three days thereby depriving the Petitioner of medical care and

treatment. The Petitioner alleges that he was indisposed physically and psychologically

due to persistent assault and arbitrary detention.

The Petitioner states that he was set free by the officers of the Circuit Crime

Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura at around 7.30 pm on the 23rd September 2017

and was handed over to the Petitioner’s mother and father. The Petitioner was

thereafter referred and admitted to the Teaching Hospital of Anuradhapura by the

Petitioner’s mother and father on the same day under the registration number (bed

head ticket) of 17-115355. The Petitioner was attended to and treated at the

Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital from 23rd September 2017 to 05th October 2017 at

Ward No. 20 where the Petitioner was pronounced to have sustained six grievous

injuries.

The Petitioner’s mother and the Petitioner lodged complaints with the

Anuradhapura branch of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka concerning the

arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention and the persistent assault, inhuman and degrading

treatment of the Petitioner inflicted by any one or more or all the 1st-8th Respondents

of the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of Anuradhapura in terms of the reference

numbers HRC/AP/430/2017(I) and HRC/AP/480/2017(W) on 26th September 2017 and

19th October 2017 respectively.

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 15

Facts of the case as per the 1st and 3rd Respondents

1st and 3rd Respondents stated that a person named N.N. Vithanage had made

a complaint to the DIG of North Central Province (11th Respondent) on 19th July 2017

regarding the theft of his motorcycle bearing the number NCWL 1657. The said N.N.

Vithanage had also previously lodged a complaint to the Anuradhapura Crimes

Division and had made the second complaint as suspects had not been apprehended

notwithstanding the CCTV footage.

Consequently, the 11th Respondent had referred the matter to the Senior

Superintendent of Police of Anuradhapura Division by way of a letter dated 19th July

2017 bearing reference No. DIG/ANP/Public/896/2017. Consequent to the above

direction by the 11th Respondent, the OIC- District Intelligence Unit of the DIG office

of Anuradhapura had written a letter to the 11th Respondent that he has perused the

CCTV footage and has identified the suspect as one Jayamuni Dushan De Silva through

private informant. He stated that he was submitting the report awaiting further

instructions from the 11th Respondent to proceed. By way of a letter dated 20th July

2017, the Senior Superintendent of Police of Anuradhapura Division had referred this

matter to the attention of the 9th Respondent and directed him to take necessary steps

before the 12th August 2017.

Consequent to the above order, the 9th Respondent had referred the matter to

the 2nd Respondent and had directed him to take necessary steps before 11th August

2017. The 2nd Respondent had thereafter informed the 9th Respondent that he was

able to uncover details about several persons who were involved in the said incident

of theft and had requested for an extension of time to further investigate and to arrest

the suspects. Consequently, on 22nd September 2017 the 1st-7th Respondents left the

Circuit Crime Investigation Division to arrest Jayamuni Dushan Chathuranga Silva, who

was a suspect identified using the aforementioned CCTV footage. The Respondents

stated that the said Jayamuni Dushan Chathuranga Silva alias Doctor alias Jabba, was

arrested at 676, Sangamitta Mawatha, Anuradhapura. When inspecting the house, they

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

had found two side mirrors of a motor bike and one Pathirana Dasanayakalage Damith

Niroshan Wijewardana alias Suranga who was also in the same house and was arrested.

When questioning said Suranga, he had informed the Respondents that the stolen bike

was given to one “Podi Akalanka”.

The aforementioned suspects were taken into custody and the Respondents

had identified the said “Podi Akalanka” as the Petitioner in the present action. The

Respondents stated that when they attempted to question the Petitioner, he acted

aggressively and created a commotion by attempting to flee. The Respondents state

that in the said attempt to flee, the Petitioner fell down after hitting a nearby fence.

The Respondents state that they held the Petitioner’s hands behind his back and

handcuffed him in order to control him. The Respondents state that even after the

Petitioner was handcuffed, he struggled and attempted to remove and/or break the

handcuffs. The Respondents state that the Petitioner’s fear and his conduct also

contributed to their suspicion.

Further, the Respondents were aware of that the Petitioner is a person who is

addicted to “Kerala Ganja” (Cannabis) and was trying to flee for that reason. However,

when questioning the Petitioner, it became apparent that the Petitioner was not

involved in the offence under the investigation and since the Respondents did not find

any Cannabis with the Petitioner at his residence, the Respondents did not arrest him.

The Respondents state that the police officers had not assaulted the Petitioner but

merely questioned him and denies the allegation of arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention

and persistent assault, inhuman and degrading treatment of the Petitioner.

Alleged violations and steps taken by the Respondents

As clearly enumerated above, the narration of events by the parties are vastly

different and contradictory, as such I find it pertinent to identify the more important

elements of the two narrations of the events prior to concluding on which narration

has been admitted as fact.

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

According to the Petitioner, he was arrested on 20th September 2017 by a team

of police officers which included the 1st and 3rd Respondents, all of whom were

attached to the Circuit Crime Investigation Division, Anuradhapura and he was

detained in the police custody for four days. During that period, the Petitioner states

that he was subjected to torture, inhuman treatment which includes the being

handcuffed, being hung with a rope in a teak tree, being assaulted etc. The Petitioner

in his evidence states that, he was hung for about 2 hours and assaulted. The Petitioner

submits that the Respondents then applied some oil and kept him at the police station.

Subsequently, on the 23rd September 2017, the Petitioner was released from police

custody. As per the submitted facts, the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of

Anuradhapura arrested aforesaid Silva and Suranga on the same date the Petitioner

was arrested and though the aforesaid Silva and Suranga were produced before the

Magistrate Court of Anuradhapura, the Petitioner was not produced.

Upon the Petitioner being released by the Circuit Crime Investigation Unit of

Anuradhapura, the Petitioner was admitted to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital for

medical treatments. The Petitioner was treated and discharged after 12 days. The

Petitioner was examined by the Judicial Medical Officer (hereinafter referred to as “the

JMO”) of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital and was issued with the Medico-Legal

Report (MLR) which is filed as “P5(a)”. The MLR identified six grievous injuries which

rendered the Petitioner unable to follow ordinary pursuits for more than 20 days. It

identified a damage of brachial plexus at neck, which is a rupture caused by a forceful

stretch causing the nerve to tear completely or partially. Further the diagnosis ticket of

the Petitioner, marked and filed as “P5”, referred the Petitioner for Neurophysiology.

The ticket and the attached Reports further elaborate on the extent of injuries suffered

by the Petitioner.

Contrary to the above position, the Respondents submit that the Petitioner was

injured during the arrest when the Petitioner had struggled and tried to flee

whereupon he injured himself by running into a fence. Further, the Respondents state

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

that they had handcuffed him with his hands behind his back as he continued to

struggle. Taking the Respondents’ narration of events into consideration, the

Respondents had not harmed the Petitioner at any instance or taken him to police

custody.

I am of the view that the MLR report and reports issued by the Neurophysiology

Unit submitted to this Court establishes and supports the position taken by the

Petitioner and not that of the 1st and 3rd Respondents in this matter. The Petitioner’s

recounting of the incidents is corroborated by the affidavits of his parents and the

aforementioned medical reports. The Respondents have failed to provide adequate

explanation as to how the Petitioner received such injuries on his neck, hands and the

upper limbs of the body. The MLR strongly corroborates the fact that the Petitioner

was hung for a considerable period of time as there were injuries on the upper part of

the body including the neck. Further, the Respondents have not submitted any

material before this Court to show that the Petitioner was a suspect in any case and to

prove that he was ever produced before a Magistrate Court. Finally, I find that it is

extremely unlikely for injuries of such severity to have been caused due to the

Petitioner merely having run into a fence as explained by the Respondents.

Keeping the above discrepancies in mind, I now wish to examine the alleged

Fundamental Rights violations. The Petitioner applies to this Court under Article 11 of

the Constitution which reads as follows:

“No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment”.

In regard to the violation of the Constitutional Rights of the Petitioner as

guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution, particularly by the 1st and 3rd

Respondents, we may refer to the case of Mrs. W. M. K De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon

Fertilizer Corporation (1989) 2 Sri LR 393 at 405 in which Amerasinghe, J stated

that,

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

“In my view Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits any act by which severe

pain or suffering, whether physical or mental is, without lawful sanction in

accordance with a procedure established by law, intentionally inflicted on

a person by a public official acting in the discharge of his executive or

administrative duties or under the colour of office”

In the instant case it is apparent that the Petitioner was subject to severe

physical pain inflicted by the Respondents acting in their official capacity. As

enumerated above, I am disinclined to believe that the Petitioner running into a fence

resulted in such grievous injuries disrupting ordinary life for a period of 20 days as

evidenced by the JMO report. In light of the reports, it is apparent that the Petitioner

was subject to grievous injury as well as substantial mental pain caused by the

situation.

Taking the above discussed opinions and Article 11 of the Constitution into

account, it is my view that the treatment meted out to the Petitioner by the 1st and 3rd

Respondent is a violation of his rights under Article 11 of the Constitution.

The Petitioner states that the arrest and detention of the Petitioner was in

contravention of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979

(as amended) and the Respondents transgressed the provisions of the same code.

Considering the arrest, we find that the police officers have completely misidentified

the suspect. This court has on numerous occasions emphasized the importance of

police officers or investigating officers conducting their arrest and searches in

accordance with the procedure established by law with a proper fact finding and

investigation process.

The Petitioner further states that his arrest is contrary to Article 13 of the

Constitution which guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and

punishment.

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

In the case of Sanjeewa, Attorney-At-Law (on behalf of Gerald Mervin

Perera) V Suraweera, Officer-In-Charge, Police Station, Wattala and Others

(2003) 1 SLR 317 in which a suspect was mistakenly identified, arrested without due

reason and severely assaulted, Fernando J expressed the following views:

“Further, had the Respondents been acting bona fide when they arrested

the Petitioner, they would have promptly recorded his statement, and

would then have either produced him before a Magistrate or released him.

The fact that they failed to record a statement (or if the IB extracts are

accurate, waited ten hours to do so) strongly suggests that they did not,

even subjectively, believe that he had committed an offence, but were

merely hoping that something would turn up. It is also probable that the

Petitioner was not given a reason for arrest.”

In the instant case the Petitioner was arrested without being given due reason

as to his arrest. Additionally, the fact that there are no arrest notes made with regard

to the arrest of the Petitioner arouses reasonable suspicion. It must be noted that the

Information Book kept in the police station does not have any entry regarding the

same.

The learned President’s Counsel for the Respondents argued that the arrest was

conducted in pursuing the statements of an actual suspect who had disclosed that he

had sold the stolen bike to one “Podi Akalanka” whom he insisted was the Petitioner

and that for this reason there was reasonable suspicion in order to arrest the Petitioner.

This Court observes that if there had been a reasonable suspicion that the Petitioner

was in some manner involved in the alleged theft due to a name divulged by an

arrested suspect, the officers should have followed the correct procedure and made

an ‘official arrest’ of the Petitioner as prescribed by law. The blatant disregard of the

relevant procedure by the Respondents leads to the finding that the Petitioner was

illegally arrested and detained contrary to Article 13 of the Constitution.

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

State responsibility

Article 11 of the Constitution endows every person with absolute protection

from torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 13 (1)

stipulates that no person shall be arrested except according to procedure established

by law and Article 13 (2) states that every person held in custody, detained or otherwise

deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest

competent court according to procedure established by law, and shall not be further

held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of

the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law. It

needs no reiteration that the primary responsibility of upholding these fundamental

protections lies with the State.

This Court has repeatedly upheld that police officers, being state officers tasked

with law enforcement and the maintenance of law and order, have an utmost

responsibility in respecting, safeguarding and advancing these rights. Police officers

are expected to extend common courtesies at all times when dealing with the public.

The identity or the status of the person whom the police is dealing with should have

no bearing whatsoever on the fair and courteous treatment that a person is entitled to

receive, as of right. Police officers are bound to treat every person with dignity and

respect. As such, in the instant case, necessary prevention measures should have been

taken by the State and the Police Department.

However, it must be noted that upon the alleged violation occurring to the

Petitioner, the 1st and 3rd Respondent were indicted before the High Court of

Anuradhapura under the case bearing no. HC 257/2019 for violation of Section 2(4) of

the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or

Punishment Act No. 22 Of 1994. Therefore, I find that the State has fulfilled their

obligations and I do not hold the State responsible for the alleged violations of

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner.

SC FR 46/2018 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 15

Decision

Accordingly, I find that the 1st Respondent, namely Sirisenage Wijesinghe and

3rd Respondent, namely W. M Nilantha Priyadarshana Wanninayake, have violated the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under Article 11, 13(1) and 13(2) of

the Constitution and I direct the 1st and 3rd Respondents to pay Rs.500,000/- each from

their personal resources to the Petitioner. I order the 1st and 3rd Respondents to pay a

further amount of Rs.25,000/- each as cost of litigation to the Petitioner.

Application allowed.
