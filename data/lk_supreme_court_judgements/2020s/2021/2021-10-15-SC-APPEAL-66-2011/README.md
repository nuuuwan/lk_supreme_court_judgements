Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The subject matter of this action is Lot 3 in Plan No. 170 (P1).

There is no dispute that by order made in the District Court

Colombo Case No. 11384/MB, Lipnus Perera became the owner

of this land in 1942 (1V4), and he gifted this land to his son, the

4

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

2nd defendant, by deed No. 1642 (P2) in 1969. The 2nd

defendant by deed No. 3047 (P3) gifted the land to the 1st and

2nd plaintiffs in 1979. Thereafter by deed No. 2861 (P4) the 2nd

defendant sold the land to the 1st defendant in 1988. The

plaintiffs filed this action seeking a declaration that they are the

owners of the land by deed P3 and that the subsequent deed P4

has no force or avail in law.

The 2nd defendant died soon after the institution of the action.

The 1st defendant filed the answer seeking a declaration that she

is the owner of the land on deed P4 which gets priority over deed

P3 on the basis that P3 was registered in a wrong folio and her

subsequent deed P4 was registered in the correct folio.

The District Court held with the plaintiffs. On appeal, the Court

of Appeal set aside the judgment of the District Court and held

with the defendant. This appeal by the plaintiffs is from the

judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Learned counsel for the plaintiffs sought leave to appeal against

the judgment of the Court of Appeal only on the following three

questions of law:

(a) Have their Lordships of the Court of Appeal erred in holding

that where a deed is registered in a new folio following a

partition of a land, it is not necessary for the purpose of

proving due registration to prove that the new folio in

which the subsequent competing deed has been registered

is a continuation of the folio in which the first registered

instrument affecting the same land is registered?

5

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

(b) Have their Lordships of the Court of Appeal erred in failing

to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court in Meurling v.

Gimarahamy 25 NLR 500 and Diyes Singho v. Herath 64

NLR 492?

(c) Is the said judgment of the Court of Appeal untenable in

law that it has selectively ignored judgments of the

Supreme Court which were binding on the said court?

In broad terms, the only question to be decided in this appeal is

the question of prior registration.

There is no question of the due execution of both deeds P3 and

P4. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs accepts before this court

that the plaintiffs deed P3 has been registered in a wrong folio.

The contention of learned counsel for the plaintiffs is that the

defendants deed P4 has also not been duly registered and

therefore the plaintiffs deed P3 shall prevail since the 2nd

defendant had no right to alienate by deed P4 after the execution

of deed P3. This argument is entitled to succeed if P4 has not

been duly registered.

Let me now consider whether P4 has been duly registered.

Section 7(1) of the Registration of Documents Ordinance, No. 23

of 1927, as amended, states that any instrument affecting land,

unless it is duly registered under Chapter III of the Ordinance,

shall be void against all parties claiming an adverse interest

thereto on valuable consideration by virtue of any subsequent

instrument which is duly registered under this Chapter.

6

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

What is due registration as contemplated in this section? The

answer is found in section 14(1) of the Registration of

Documents Ordinance. The basic principle is that any

instrument affecting land shall be registered in the folio in which

the first registered instrument was registered or in another folio

maintained in continuation thereof with cross references

connecting the folios are properly made. (Heenappuhamy v.

Charles (1973) 77 NLR 169)

Section 14(1) reads as follows:

Every instrument presented for registration shall be

registered in the book allotted to the division in which the

land affected by the instrument is situated and in the folio

in which the first registered instrument affecting the same

land is registered, or in another folio (whether of the same

volume or of another volume) bearing a separate number,

opened in continuation thereof, cross reference being

entered in the prescribed manner so as to connect the said

folios.

Based on section 14(1), the argument of learned counsel for the

plaintiffs is that the defendant failed to prove that her

subsequent deed P4 was registered in the folio in which the first

deed affecting the land was registered or in another folio opened

in continuation of the said folio (in which the first deed affecting

the land was registered).

I regret my inability to agree with this argument for the following

reasons.

7

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

According to 1V4, the deed of Lipnus Perera was registered in

folio M 433/268. Lipnus Perera amalgamated the said land of 1

rood and 8 perches with another land of 1 rood and 16.75

perches and subdivided the amalgamated land into 8 lots by

Plan P1.

These new lots were registered in different new folios with cross

references to the previous folio M 433/268 (1V4).

The new folio opened for Lot 3 (the subject matter of this action)

is M 936/176 (1V6).

There is a cross reference in 1V6 which says vide M 433/268

[1V4] and 417/83 for original lands.

There is a cross reference in 1V4 which says vide M 936/175-

180, 182 for Lots 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8 after amalgamation of this

land with another land.

It is in this new folio 1V6 that the unimpeached deed P2 and all

other subsequent deeds including the defendants deed P4 (save

and except the plaintiffs deed P3) were registered.

The plaintiffs deed P3 was registered in a completely different

folio M 1211/185 without any cross reference to folio M

433/268 (1V4) or M 936/176 (1V6).

Hence prima facie the new folio 1V6 is the correct folio.

The precise point made by learned counsel for the plaintiffs is

that there is a reference in folio 1V4 that the said folio was

brought forward from another folio, namely M 423, and since

this latter folio was not produced in evidence, the defendant

8

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

failed to prove that her deed P4 was duly registered in the folio

in which the first registered instrument affecting the land was

registered or in another folio opened in continuation thereof as

required by section 14(1). Learned counsel cites Meurling v.

Gimarahamy (1922) 25 NLR 500 and Diyes Singho v. Herath

(1962) 64 NLR 492 in support.

Section 14(1) is subject to provisos. However learned counsel for

the plaintiffs does not refer to them. Proviso (a) to section 14(1)

reads as follows:

[A]n instrument may, if the Registrar thinks fit, be entered

in a new folio, cross references being entered in the

prescribed manner so as to connect the registration with

any previous registration affecting the same land or any

part thereof.

It is admitted that a new folio was opened for Lot 3 after the

subdivision by Plan P1. As I will explain below, this is

permissible and learned counsel for the plaintiffs does not

dispute it.

There is a difference between section 14(1) and the proviso (a) to

section 14(1).

According to section 14(1) Every instrument presented for

registration shall be registeredin the folio in which the first

registered instrument affecting the same land is registered, or in

another folioopened in continuation thereof, cross reference

being entered in the prescribed manner so as to connect the said

folios.

9

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

But the proviso (a) to section 14(1) states that if a new folio is

opened (as opposed to continuing with the earlier one), cross

references shall be made to connect the registration with any

previous registration affecting the same land. No doubt any

previous registration does not encapsulate a wrong registration.

As I have already explained, the new folio 1V6 satisfies the

requirement in the proviso (a) to section 14(1) by the cross

reference to the previous registration M 433/268 (1V4).

In addition, the previous registration 1V4 also contains a cross

reference to the new registration 1V6 thereby connecting both

folios.

What is the purpose of registration? It is mainly to facilitate

reference to all existing alienations or encumbrances affecting

the land.

Under the proviso (a) to section 14(1), the Registrar of Lands has

the discretion to open a new folio with cross references

connecting the new registration with any previous registration.

A new folio is opened, for instance, when new allotments of land

come into existence by way of partition, be it by way of a decree

of court or amicable partition. (Ramasamy Chetty v. Marikar

(1915) 18 NLR 503 at 505, Karunanayake v. Gunasekara (1962)

65 NLR 529)

When a new folio is opened without cross reference to the old

folio and without a corresponding cross reference in the old folio

to the new folio, it is a wrong folio. Nevertheless, it was held in

Chelliah Pillai v. Devadason (1937) 39 NLR 68 that if proper

10

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

references are later made in the correct folio and the wrong folio

connecting both, the new folio must be regarded as a right folio

from the time the cross references are made.

There can be a rare situation where cross reference is not

necessary for the reason that no deed affecting the land has

been previously registered. This is recognised by the proviso (b)

to section 14(1), which reads as follows:

[W]here no instrument affecting the same land has been

previously registered, the instrument shall be registered in

a new folio to be allotted by the Registrar.

The two cases strongly relied on by learned counsel for the

plaintiffs, Meurling v. Gimarahamy (1922) 25 NLR 500 and Diyes

Singho v. Herath (1962) 64 NLR 492 are clearly distinguishable

from the instant case. In these two cases, there was no question

of new folios being opened but the competing deeds were

registered in folios maintained in continuation of the original

folios. What was considered in these two cases was the

applicability of section 14(1) and not the proviso (a) to section

14(1).

In point of fact, when Meurlings case was decided in 1922, what

was in force was the Land Registration Ordinance, No. 14 of

1891, wherein there was no corresponding section to the proviso

(a) to section 14(1) of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

In Meurlings case, the deeds were registered in two different

folios and the folio in which any deed was first registered was

11

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

rightly considered the correct folio. In the instant case there are

no such complications.

In Diyes Singhos case, the plaintiffs competing subsequent

deed was registered in the folio where the partition decree was

registered, but that folio indicated that it had itself been brought

forward from another folio which was not explained by the

plaintiff who produced the subsequent deed. The partition deed

was not registered in a new folio but in continuation of the

earlier folio and there was no consensus that the partition

decree was registered in the correct folio. Hence the

applicability of the proviso (a) to section 14(1) of the Registration

of Documents Ordinance was never considered. In the instant

case there is no such question.

The Supreme Court in Diyes Singhos case made a pertinent

observation at page 494: The question whether an instrument

has been duly registered as required by the Ordinance is a mixed

question of law and fact. It is not a pure question of law.

In the instant case it is undisputed that Lipnus Perera became

the owner of the land registered in 1V4 and, after the sub-

division of the land, the lot in dispute (Lot 3) was registered in

the new folio 1V6 with cross references made in both 1V4 and

1V6. Lipnus Perera then gifted Lot 3 by deed P2 to the 2nd

defendant and it was registered in 1V6. At the trial, the

plaintiffs did not put in issue that Lipnus Pereras deed

(registered in 1V4 as far back as in 1942) or the 2nd defendants

deed P2 (registered in 1V6 as far back as in 1969) was registered

in a wrong folio. No such suggestion was made to the officer

12

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

from the Land Registry called to give evidence by the defendant.

The only suggestion made to this witness was that there is a

reference in 1V4 that it was brought forward from M 423 (which

is the number of the volume; the folio number is unclear in

1V4).

Let me make two points clear: this is not a criminal case to raise

some doubts and take advantage of the situation; and litigation

is not a game of hide and seek.

Unless the matter (which is a question of fact or a mixed

question of fact and law) is clearly and explicitly put in issue in

the trial court, a party cannot pursue such matter for the first

time on appeal.

In the instant case, the plaintiffs by way of issues 1-5 took up

the position that by deed P3 they became the owner of the land

and the subsequent alienation of the same land by the same

person in favour of the defendant by deed P4 conveys no right to

the latter. This position was taken up under the common law.

Whilst accepting that her deed is the subsequent deed from the

same source, the defendant by way of issues 6-21 took up the

position that the plaintiffs deed was registered in the wrong folio

and her deed was registered in the correct folio and therefore her

deed supersedes the plaintiffs deed. This position was taken

under section 7(1) read with section 14 of the Registration of

Documents Ordinance.

Thereupon the plaintiffs by way of consequential issues 22 and

23 took up the position that although the defendants deed is

13

SC/APPEAL/66/2011

registered in the correct folio, the defendant is disentitled to the

benefit of prior registration because the defendants deed was

obtained and prior registration was secured by fraud or

collusion. This position was taken under section 7(2) of the

Registration of Documents Ordinance, which states But fraud or

collusion in obtaining such subsequent instrument or in securing

the prior registration thereof shall defeat the priority of the person

claiming thereunder. This was the focal point in the trial court

but was not pursued before this court. The plaintiffs by way of

consequential issues did not take up the position that the

defendants deed was registered in a wrong folio.

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the defendant has proved

that her subsequent deed P4 was duly registered.

I also note that the first question of law before this court is on a

wrong premise in that the Court of Appeal has not stated that

where a deed is registered in a new folio it is not necessary to

prove that the new folio is a continuation of the folio in which

the first deed was registered. What the Court of Appeal has

stated is the deed No. 2861 (P4) has been duly registered in

volume M 936 folio 176 (1V6) in continuation of folio 268 in

volume M 433 (1V4).

I answer all three questions of law in the negative and dismiss

the appeal but without costs.
