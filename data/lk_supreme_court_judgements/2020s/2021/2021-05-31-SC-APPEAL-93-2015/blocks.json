Kandaswamy, licensed surveyor to make the plan marked P2 accordingly. Further, none of them have said that Moulana got the service of S. Kandasamy, licensed surveyor to amalgamate divided 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte with Nithulagahagedarawatte and accordingly to make the plan marked P2. None of the witnesses of the defendant has stated that Moulana got the service of S. Kumarasamy, licensed surveyor to amalgamate divided 2/3rd of Ihalagahagedarawatte with Nithulagahagedarawatte. Defendant\u2019s stance as said before is that only undivided 2/3rd of Ihalagahagedarawatte was sold to Junus Lebbe, one of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title but not that the said plan marked P2 contains an identified 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte. The certified copy of plan marked P2 found at page 384 of the brief, which appears to have been initialed by the trial judge when it was marked, only indicates that it was made by S. Kandaswamy, licensed surveyor in 1928, and it shows an amalgamated two allotments of land, one called Nitulagahagedarawatte and the other called Ihalagedarawatte. Nowhere does it state that only 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte was amalgamated in making the said plan. It is also observed that the total extent given in the plan is 1 Rood and 8.8 Perches, in other words 48 perches. As per the diagram, the portion shown as Nitulgedarawatte is 21.6 perches and the portion shown as Ihalagedarawatte is 27.2 perches. The said certified copy of plan P2 shows a protruded portion towards South, and as per the evidence that area seems to be the disputed area in the action filed in the district court. (However, there is a photo copy of the original of the same plan found at page 433 of the brief which is not initialed by the trial judge indicating that it was not the one marked at the trial. Anyhow, for the purpose of this decision this court has to consider the copy that appears to have been initialed by the trial judge).

There is no doubt that the words \u201cwhich said premises adjoining each other\u201d refers to the premises described in the part 1 and part 2 of the schedule. In interpreting the schedule, now it is important to recognize the premises described in those two parts of the schedule. There cannot be any ambiguity that the premises described in the 1st part of the schedule is Nithulagahagedarawatte within the four boundaries described therein as it is an identifiable land described therein the 1st part of the schedule. However, the second part of the schedule refers to an undivided 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte and boundaries to Ihalagedarawatte has been mentioned there in the second part of the schedule. When it refers to an undivided 2/3rd, it does not indicate an identifiable portion of a land. Thus, an unidentifiable portion cannot mean a premises that can be amalgamated with another property to form one property. Only premises that can be identifiable in the second part of the schedule is the land called Ihalagedarawatte mentioned therein with the four boundaries to identify it. Thus, this court opines that what is meant by the words \u201cWhich said premises adjoining each other now form one property of the extent \u2026\u2026\u2026..according to the plan of survey No.1288\u2026\u2026.\u201d is that Nithulagahagedarawatte and Ihalagedarawatte now form one property as depicted in plan 1288. To give another meaning to say that Moulana separated undivided 2/3rd as a divided 2/3rd and get it to form one land by amalgamating it with the other land called Nithulagahagedarawatte as depicted in plan 1288 amounts to an addition of words which are not there in the schedule. Thus, the interpretation given by the learned district judge to the schedule of the said deed cannot be accepted and the learned district judge erred in understanding and interpreting the schedule of the said deed. As observed above there was no other oral or documentary evidence acceptable to court that Moulana separated divided 2/3rd from Ihalagedarawatte and amalgamated it with Nithulagahagedarawatte and got S.S. Kandasamy, licensed surveyor to depict in his plan as one land. What the evidence led at the trial indicate is that the original owner Moulana transferred to Junus Lebbe entirety of Nithulagahagedarawatte and undivided",

Kandasamy, licensed surveyor to described the main land when he transferred as aforesaid to Junus Lebbe in 1933. It is true that plan marked P2 depicts an amalgamated land of the two lands mentioned above but there is nothing to say that it was only 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte contained in plan forming the amalgamated land. If 1/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte was left out in making that, one boundary adjoining Ihalagedarwatte in the said plan should have been described as the remaining part of Ihalagedarawatte belonging to Moulana but such description is not found among the description of boundaries in P2. Description of boundaries in the plan marked P2 around the land identified as Ihalagedarawatte tallies with the boundaries given to Ihalagedarawatte in the second part of the schedule quoted above indicating that there cannot be any left out 1/3rd portion of Ihalagedarawatte adjoining the land depicted in P2.",

Especially the parts of the said inferences that indicate that Moulana got the service of the said surveyor to separate an identified 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte to form a one property with Nithulagahagedarawatte and the balance 1/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte shall lie outside the land shown in plan marked P2 are mere conjectures and surmises which are not supported by the evidence led. If the said plan was made to transfer Nithulagedarawatte and identified 2/3rd of Ihalahedarawatte to Junus Lebbe, it is very unlikely to have a five-year gap between the plan and the transfer deed. Thus, it is the view of this Court that Moulana transferred the entirety of Nithulagahagedarawatte in plan marked P2 and an undivided 2/3rd only of Ihalagedarawatte shown in P2 to Junus Lebbe by P4. Anyway, it appears from the contents of P4 that Moulana had mortgaged the same property to Junus Lebbe in 1928 and certain payments were pending and the vendor and vendee agreed to execute a conditional transfer of the property as per P4, but there is no sufficient material to decide that in 1928 for the purpose of the mortgage Moulana separated 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte and made the plan P2.",

    "text": "It is true that, as the learned district judge observed, Moulana being the sole owner had the right and capacity to transfer a divided portion of Ihalagedarawatte but as per the documents, what he had transferred to Junus Lebbe was an undivided 2/3rd share. By that Moulana remained a co-owner to the land named Ihalagedarawatte even after he executed P4. Hence, through the other deeds marked by the plaintiff company, namely P5 to P6 the plaintiff company only gets title to Ihalagedarawatte as a co-owner along with Moulana and with his demise along with his heirs. As per the documentary evidence placed before the district court, plaintiff has been able to prove only a co-ownership to the land called Ihalagedarwatte. The defendant claim title to 1/3rd owing to a deed of transfer no. 4902 from the children of Moulana which was marked as P10. It must be noted that there was no dispute that vendors of that deed were children of Moulana. Even the plaintiff\u2019s stance in paragraph 6 of their plaint was that the defendant claims title through the said deed marked P10 executed by the children of Moulana where those children had no right to execute such a deed. No issue had been raised challenging P10 as a deed not executed by the children of Moulana. Hence, the learned district judge\u2019s comment that it was not proved that vendors of P10 are the children of Moulana is irrelevant as it was not a matter that parties were at variance, even to raise an issue. Further, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses had admitted in evidence that P10 was executed by Moulana\u2019s children.15 Thus, as per the documents tendered in evidence parties were co-owners to Ihalagedarawatte. One co-owner cannot file a rei vindication action to evict another co-owner since all the co-owners have title to the land and since rei vindicatio is an action based on title. Even the learned high court judges have correctly stated that a co-owner cannot successfully maintain an action against another co-owner.16 Thus, unless the plaintiff company could prove prescriptive title to the disputed area or to the whole land named Ihalagedrawatte found in P2, its action should fail.",

A co-owner cannot put an end to the co-ownership by a secret intention in his mind.18 Hence, the plaintiff company being a co-owner as per its paper title, has to prove ouster or something equivalent to ouster and adverse possession for ten years to claim prescriptive title. It has to prove an overt act or circumstances that a happening of an overt act could be presumed along with adverse possession over 10 years from such an event. Since this is a rei vindicatio action this court has to first see whether the plaintiff was successful in proving his case first. As indicated above he failed in proving exclusive title to Ihalagedarawatte on deeds. Therefore, now it is important to consider whether the plaintiff had proved its title by prescription against the defendant. The two surveyors and the police officer who came for inspection after the police complaint were not competent to give any evidence regarding ouster or of an overt act as they had come to give evidence on the plans they made and the inspection done as per the said police complaint respectively. Other lay witnesses called by the plaintiff, namely Mohomad Nasar Mohideen, Yathi Samul Huk Mohideen and Siabdeen Ahamaed Mohideen do not speak of any ouster or of an overt act or any adverse possession against the plaintiff. Some of them had just stated that before the dispute started, they possessed the disputed portion.19 However, they do not reveal how they possessed the disputed area. Such mere statements of possession are not sufficient to prove even possession of the disputed area. As said before as per the plan marked P3, it is visible that there are no buildings constructed by the plaintiff on the disputed area and one witness of the plaintiff has stated in evidence that the disputed area is barren.20 Hence there is no construction or plantation by the plaintiff to prove its possession with regard to the disputed area.

Even if his paper title fails for some reason such as technical or defect in the title, if he has possessed the property as the owner against others without accepting anyone else as the owner for 10 years or more, he may be successful in his claim on prescriptive title. Further, it is also queried whether the statement of the learned high court judges which connote that as per section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance that one cannot plead prescriptive title against one\u2019s own legal or paper title is an accurate statement of law. It is pertinent to note that, said section 3 does not contemplate a situation where a person claims prescriptive title against his own paper title. It contemplates where a defendant claim prescription on a title adverse to the plaintiff or a claimant and in the like manner a plaintiff or an intervenient party claims on a title adverse to the others. In fact, if one has paper title, his possession relates that title and it can be an adverse possession against others but not against his own paper title. On the other hand, if one has paper title, he needs not plead prescription against his own title. In the case at hand, plaintiff has not pleaded prescription against its own title but has pleaded it coupled with paper title against the defendant. Thus, making the said statement it appears that the learned high court judges have misunderstood the pleading of the plaintiff.

The property described in the 1st schedule to the plaint was the land in plan marked P2. As observed and elaborated above by this court, there is no evidence to indicate that land in P2 contains only a divided portion 2/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte along with the other land. Thus, P2 appears to contain entire Ihalagedarawatte and Nithulagahagedarawatte. Hence there cannot be any difference in the 1st schedule to the plaint and the amalgamation of entire",

As mentioned before, in the original court, issues have been raised with regard to the co-ownership and issues need not be limited to the pleadings. No objection has been raised against such issues. Thus, now no one can say that it was no body\u2019s case. However, evidence was not available to state that the original owner transferred a defined lot of land of Ihalagedarawatte. Thus, the learned high court judges did not err when they mentioned the need to prove ouster. As such the answer to 6th question of law is in the negative.",

It appears that the learned high court judges came to the conclusion that 1/3rd of Ihalagedarawatte belongs to the defendant and 2/3rd of the same belongs to the plaintiff and they are co-owners. Both sides get their title from Moulana or his heirs. Thus, there seems to be a conflict, but as observed before, learned district judge\u2019s decision cannot be allowed to stand and the final conclusion to set aside that judgment and to dismiss the plaintiffs action by the learned high court judges is correct. Thus, the answer is \u2018yes there seems to be a conflict between the said statement and the findings, but it does not warrant the setting aside of the final conclusion reached by the high court\u2019. As indicated above there are some misstatements, misunderstandings, and conflicting statements in the learned high court Judges\u2019 judgment but the",
