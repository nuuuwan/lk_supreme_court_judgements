Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J

This is an appeal to set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo which affirmed the order of the Labour Tribunal made in respect of the right

to begin the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal.

The applicant-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the workman) filed an

application in the Labour Tribunal citing John Keells Holdings PLC, Jaykay Marketing Services

(Private) Ltd and Keells Food Products PLC as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents respectively for the

unlawful termination of his services by the 1st respondent company.

The workman stated that he was appointed by the 2nd respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the 2nd respondent company) as a Junior Sales Representative on the 22nd of April,

1991.

The workman further stated that thereafter, on the 1st of May, 1996 he was appointed as an

Executive by the 1st respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 1st respondent

company) and seconded to the 2nd respondent Company, which is a subsidiary of the 1st

respondent company.

Thereafter, the workman had worked for both the 1st and 2nd respondent companies and was

promoted as Sales Manager whilst working for the 1st respondent company.

The workman stated that a fresh letter of appointment was given to him by John Keells Foods India

Private Limited on the 18th of January, 2010, which is also a subsidiary of the 1st respondent

company and he was deployed to work in India as the Head of Sales to work in that company.

However, as the operations of the said company were closed down in 2010, the workman returned

to Sri Lanka.

The workman further stated that after he returned to Sri Lanka, he was appointed as a Channel

Manager Retail of the 3rd respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 3rd

respondent company). However, he was not issued a letter of appointment for the said post.

By the letter dated 10th of February, 2014, the workman stated that he was suspended from work

by the 3rd respondent company.

5

Thereafter, a letter of show cause was issued by the 3rd respondent dated 3rd of March, 2014 which

contained the following charges:

(1) That during the period December 2013 to February 2014, you did attempt to purchase

pork from a Company Supplier, at a higher price, in commercial quantities as morefully

set out in the preamble of this letter.

(2) (i) That your conduct as set out in charge (1) above indicates that you have

established a business in competition with your employer, Keells Food

Products PLC.

or in the alternative;

(ii) That you have attempted to carry on a business in competition with your

employer, Keells Food Products PLC.

(3) That by your conduct set out in charges (1) and (2) above, you did blatantly and

willfully violate Clause C of the Code of Conduct of the company under the caption

conflict of interest in your contract of employment and the law of the land.

(4) That you did fail to divulge your Spouses business interests as morefully set out in the

preamble of this letter which constitutes a further violation of Clause C of the Code

of Conduct under the Caption Conflict of Interest.

(5) That by your conduct set out herein which has caused or intended to cause loss and

damage to the company you did act in a manner which is unbecoming of a person

holding the post of Channel Manager Retail, and thereby breach the trust and

confidence reposed in you by the Management.

The workman stated that he denied all the charges levelled against him in his response to the

letter of show cause. Thereafter, a domestic inquiry was conducted by the 3rd respondent

company to inquire into the charges levelled against the workman.

Later, by letter dated 23rd of June, 2014, the 1st respondent company terminated the services of the

workman stating that he had been found guilty of the aforesaid charges levelled against him.

The workman stated that however, the termination of his services was unlawful and unjust.

Accordingly, the workman prayed inter alia:

(a) for reinstatement with back wages, or

6

(b) for compensation in lieu of such reinstatement

The respondents filed a common answer and stated that they are related parties of which the 1st

respondent is the holding company. It was further stated that at all times material to the application

filed in the Labour Tribunal, the workman was employed by the 1st respondent company and

seconded to the 3rd respondent company.

In the said answer, it was further stated that the 3rd respondent company being a subsidiary of the

1st respondent company, whom the workman was seconded to, was authorised by the 1st respondent

company to conduct the domestic inquiry in respect of the alleged misconduct of the workman. At

the conclusion of the domestic inquiry, the workman was found guilty of the charges levelled

against him.

The respondents further stated that in the foregoing circumstances, the termination of the

workmans services by the 1st respondent company was just and equitable. Accordingly, the

respondents prayed inter alia to have the application dismissed.

When the application was taken up for inquiry before the Labour Tribunal, the respondents had

submitted that there was an ambiguity as to who the employer of the workman was, since two of

the respondents had denied employment and termination of the services of the workman.

As the parties were unable to agree as to who should begin the inquiry and lead evidence, the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal directed the parties to file written submissions on the

right to begin the inquiry.

Thereafter, the Labour Tribunal has held that as the 1st respondent company admitted termination,

it should justify the termination. Accordingly, it had been ordered that the 1st respondent company

and the other subsidiary companies in the group which had been named as respondents should

commence the inquiry.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, the respondents

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden

in Colombo.

After hearing the said appeal, the learned High Court judge has held that since the respondents are

part of the same group of companies, and as the 1st respondent had admitted the employment and

7

termination of the services of the workman, the order of the Labour Tribunal directing the

respondents to commence the inquiry is not contrary to law.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Provincial High Court holden in Colombo, the respondents

sought special leave to appeal from this court and special leave to appeal was granted on the

following questions of law:

(a) Did the learned High Court Judge err in failing to interpret and apply the established

principles of the law of evidence on the burden of starting?

(b) Did the learned High Court Judge err in law by failing to appreciate that there was no

consensus as to the identity of the Applicants employer and/ or that two Respondents had

denied employment and/ or termination?

(c) Did the learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to recognize that, in circumstances

where there were more than one Respondent, some of whom had not admitted employment

or termination, the burden of starting would be on the Applicant?

(d) Did the learned High Court Judge err in failing to recognize that the learned President of

the Labour Tribunal erred in law in directing the Respondents to begin the case?

Submissions of the respondents

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that as there are three respondents, the burden

is on the workman to prove who the real employer was.

In support of his submission, the learned counsel cited the case of United Corporations and

Mercantile Union v Vos (Gazette of 6.5.77) referred to in the Law of Dismissal by S.R. De Silva

at page 122 where it was held: where an employer denies termination of the services of a worker,

the burden of proof is on the worker to establish to the satisfaction of Court that his services had

been terminated by the employer.

The learned counsel contended that the only exception to the said rule is where the employer admits

termination.

It was further submitted that in the instant appeal, only the 1st respondent had admitted the

employment and termination of the services of the workman. Neither, the 2nd nor the 3rd

respondents have admitted employment and termination of the services of the workman.

8

Thus, where there is no agreement as to the identity of the employer, the workman should first

establish the identity of his employer. In the absence of an admission, with regard to who the

employer of the workman is, the burden is on the workman to prove the same.

Submissions of the workman

The learned counsel for the workman submitted that since the 1st respondent had admitted the

employment and termination of the workman, and the 2nd and 3rd respondents were in the same

group of companies, it is the respondents who should start the case to justify the termination of the

workman.

The learned counsel cited the case of The Ceylon Mercantile Union v Management Mount Lavinia

Hotel CGG SC Minutes 7th July, 1961 which held: In the case of termination of employment

burden is on the employer to justify the termination on the principle that He who alters the status

quo, and not he who demands its restoration, must explain the reason for such alteration. in

support of his submission.

Further, the learned counsel cited the case of The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd v Merven

Perera [C.A. 391/79] SC Minutes 25th September, 1981 which held; the burden is on the

employer to prove that the termination was justified.

Did the learned High Court Judge err in failing to recognize that the learned President of

the Labour Tribunal erred in law in directing the Respondents to begin the case?

Section 31C (1) read with section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 as amended

stipulates the duties and powers of the Labour Tribunal with regard to an application made under

section 31B (1) of the said Act.

Section 31C reads as follows:

(1) Where an application under section 31B is made to a labour tribunal, it shall

be the duty of that tribunal to make all such inquiries into that application and

hear all such evidence as the tribunal may consider necessary, and thereafter

make, not later than six months from the date of such application, such order

as may appear to the tribunal to be just and equitable.

9

(2) A labour tribunal conducting an inquiry shall observe the procedure

prescribed under section 31A, in respect of the conduct of proceedings before

the tribunal. [Emphasis added]

The scope of the aforementioned section was considered in Merril J Fernando & Co v Deiman

Singho (1988) 2 SLR 242 where the Court of Appeal held;

As was submitted by learned counsel for the appellant there is a significant

difference between the duties and powers of a Labour Tribunal under Section 31C

(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended by Section 6 of Act No. 74 of 1962

and the original provisions as contained in Act No. 62 of 1957. Whereas the

original Section required the Tribunal to hear such evidence as may be tendered

. the amended Section makes it the duty of the Tribunal to hear all such

evidence as the tribunal may consider necessary. The latter indeed is a very

salutary provision which the Tribunal should not have lost sight of.

[Emphasis added]

Accordingly, the Labour Tribunal is required by law to hear all such evidence as the tribunal may

consider necessary and make a just and equitable order.

The principle of just and equitable is based on fairness and justness. Equity ensures that the law

does not produce unnecessarily or unintended harsh outcomes which unfairly prejudices a party.

It solves an issue not according to the strict legal technicalities, but with the principles of justice

and application of the established rules and principles after evaluation of facts and circumstances

of a given case. It is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range

of potentially competing considerations.

On the contrary, justice of an individual case refers to justice objectively and consistently

evaluated and applied according to law and established principles, upon definite grounds.

A just and equitable order cannot be made in the subjective eye of the judge. It is not a discretionary

judgment. A just and equitable order must be fair to all the parties in any given situation.

10

As stated above section 31C (1) of the Industrial Dispute Act as amended requires the Labour

Tribunal to make a just and equitable order. Further, section 33 of the said act specifies inter

alia the contents of an order.

However, like in any other litigation, before making an order under section of 31C (1) of the said

Act there can be several interim orders that are required to be made in an inquiry before the Labour

Tribunal. Some orders may be on a pure question of law or a mixed question of law and facts or

purely on a factual position. All such interim orders will invariably have an impact on the final

order made under the said section. Thus, in order to make a just and equitable order at the

conclusion of the inquiry, all interim orders made during an inquiry, should also be just and

equitable. If the interim orders are not just and equitable, the final order made after an inquiry

cannot be a just and equitable.

The procedure applicable to Labour Tribunals are set out in the Regulations published under

section 31A of the Industrial Disputes Act. Regulation 30 of the Industrial Disputes Regulations,

1958 states:

At the hearing in regard to any matter before an Industrial Court or an arbitrator

or a Labour Tribunal, such Court or arbitrator or the Tribunal may call upon the

parties, in such order as the Court or the arbitrator or the Tribunal thinks fit, to

state the case. [Emphasis added]

Thus, Regulation 30 has conferred power on the Labour Tribunal to call upon parties to begin their

respective cases in such order as the tribunal thinks fit. However, the discretion conferred on the

Labour Tribunal to call upon the parties to begin their respective cases by the said regulation should

be applied taking in to consideration; the procedure established by law, the jurisprudence

developed by courts and the facts and circumstances of each case with the object of making a just

and equitable order at the conclusion of the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal.

Further, in W.A.A.M. Dharmasena v Superintendent, Kekunagoda Estate (SC Appeal 142/2010)

SC Minutes 13th August, 2015 at page 8, it was held:

[.] Section 31C (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Regulations published

thereunder, the provisions of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 as amended and the

decided cases show that section 31C (1) of the Industrial Disputes (Amendment)

Act No. 62 of 1957 conferred the inquisitorial powers on the Labour Tribunal which

11

was later widened by Act No. 4 of 1962. However, section 41 of the Judicature Act

as amended, the said Regulations and the requirement to make a just and equitable

order in terms of section 31C (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended require

a Labour Tribunal to follow certain aspects of the adversarial system too. Thus,

an inquiry before a Labour Tribunal under section 31C (1) is a mixture of an

inquisitorial and adversarial systems. [.] [Emphasis added]

Hence, in addition to the powers conferred on the Labour Tribunal by the said Rule, the Labour

Tribunal has the power to decide how the inquiry should be conducted as inquisitorial powers are

conferred on it, by the Industrial Disputes Act. The inquisitorial power conferred on the Labour

Tribunal was discussed in detail in the aforementioned judgement.

In the instant appeal, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal directed the respondent

companies to begin their cases on the basis that despite the 2nd and 3rd respondent companies had

denied employment of the workman, the 1st respondent company had admitted the employment

and termination of the workman and all 3 of the said companies are in the same group of

companies. In fact, the workman has been working for all the respondent companies.

A cursus curiae has developed that an employer who admits terminating the services of a workman

should commence leading evidence as the burden is on him to justify that termination.

In Thevarayan v Balakrishnan (1984) 1 SLR 194 it was held:

In a case of termination of employment, the burden is on the employer to justify

the termination on the principle that he who alters the status quo, and not he who

demands its restoration, must explain the reasons for such alteration.

However, when the employer has denied employment or termination, or in the case of vacation of

post or constructive termination, the workman should start the case. Further, it is pertinent to note

that even if the employer had admitted employment, the workman should begin the case if malice

was pleaded or if the employee was on probation at the time of termination.

In Anderson v Husni [2001] 1 SLR 68 it was held:

Let me add that that principle is the foundation of the cursus curiae in the Labour

Tribunal where termination (of confirmed employment) is not admitted. In such

cases the appellant must begin. Why? Because if no evidence at all were given on

12

either side, on the material available to the Tribunal, it is the applicant who would

fail.

Further, in State Distilleries Corporation v Rupasinghe [1994] 2 SLR 395 it was held:

What then is the principal difference between confirmed and probationary

employment? In the former, the burden is on the employer to justify termination;

and he must do by reference to objective standards. In the latter, upon proof that

termination took place during probation the burden is on the employee to establish

unjustifiable termination, and the employee must establish at least prima facie of

mala fides, before the employer is called upon to adduce evidence as to his reasons

for dismissal; and the employer does not have to show that the dismissal was,

objectively, justified.

In the instant appeal, as stated above the workman alleged that he was employed by both the 1st

and 2nd respondent companies. However, only the 1st respondent company had admitted the

employment and termination of the workman. Both the 2nd and 3rd respondents have denied

employment of the workman in the common answer filed by the respondent companies.

In Ceylon Bank Employees Union v Yatawara 64 NLR 49, the definition of the word employer

was considered by Sansoni, J as follows:

Apart from these considerations however, when one analyses the definition of the

word employer, one finds that its first meaning is any person who employs,

and the third meaning is a body of employers (whether such body is a firm,

company, corporation or trade union). [Emphasis added]

Further, the word employer was considered in Colombo Paints Ltd v De Mel (1973) 76 NLR

381 at page 383 where it was held:

[.] The legal intricacies that lay between the petitioner and the 3rd respondent

have not been so mystifying and so distracting as to prevent me from coming to a

clear finding that the 4th respondents employment was within the same family of

Companies. He did the same work under the same conditions at the same place

under the same persons, with the petitioner. Whatever changed, the substantial

nature and relationship in his employment did not change.

13

The facts placed before me lead to the only reasonable inference that the petitioner

came within the meaning of the term employer as defined by the Act. [.]

As stated above, the Labour Tribunal is required to make a just and equitable order not only at the

conclusion of the inquiry but also with regard to interim orders. Moreover, Regulation 30

empowers the Labour Tribunal to call upon the parties as the Tribunal thinks fit to state their case.

Further, the Labour Tribunal exercises inquisitorial powers when conducting an inquiry. Thus, it

is entitled to use its discretion in conducting the inquiry in order to make a just and equitable order

subject to the aforementioned criteria.

The case of United Corporations and Mercantile Union v Vos (supra) cited by the respondents has

no application to the instant appeal as the 1st respondent company which is part of the group of

companies had admitted termination.

Thus, I am of the opinion that the Labour Tribunal had acted in terms of the law when it made the

order directing the 1st respondent company and the other subsidiary companies in the group to

commence the inquiry. Further, the High Court did not err in law when it held that since the

respondents are part of the same group of companies, and as the 1st respondent had admitted the

employment and termination of the services of the workman, the order of the Labour Tribunal

directing the respondents to commence the inquiry is not contrary to law.

Further, it is pertinent to note that the respondents had filed a common answer and stated that they

are related parties of which the 1st respondent is the holding Company. In light of the above, the

following question of law is answered as follows:

Did the learned High Court Judge err in failing to recognize that the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal erred in law in directing the Respondents to begin the case?

No

In view of the foregoing answer, the other questions of law set out above, need not be considered.

The appeal is dismissed.

Taking into consideration of the fact that the services of the workman were terminated on the 23rd

of June, 2014, the Labour Tribunal is directed to conclude the inquiry expeditiously. The Registrar

14

of this court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the Labour Tribunal to take steps in

accordance with the law.

I order no costs.
