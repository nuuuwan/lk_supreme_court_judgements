The Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner/Appellant (the plaintiff/appellant) came before

this Court being aggrieved by the judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court of the North

Western Province, holden in Kurunegala (the High Court).

By the said judgement, the High Court upheld the appeal of the 5th Defendant-Appellant-

Respondent (the 5th defendant/respondent) and set aside and dismissed the judgement entered

by the District Court of Puttlam, permitting the partitioning of the land as prayed for by the

plaintiff.

To state the facts of this appeal in brief, the plaintiff filed action in the District Court of

Puttlam, in the year 2008, seeking to partition a divided southern portion of a land called and

4

known as Amanakkangkadu in Kuruvikulam, Puttlam, in extent 0A 2R 4P described morefully

and referred to in schedule B to the plaint.

The land was to be partitioned among the plaintiff, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants in the

following manner.

- plaintiff 13/14th share of the land less 30.70 perches

- 1st defendant 1/14th share of the land

- 2nd defendant - 23.94 perches

- 3rd defendant - 06.76 perches

The plaintiffs case was that by a deed bearing No. 1457 dated 01-01-1985, executed

by A.M.M. Abdul Cader N.P., the plaintiff became entitled to an undivided 13/14th share of the

land to be partitioned, which is morefully described in schedule B to the plaint.

Out of the said undivided land, 30.70 perches was transferred by the plaintiff to her sister,

the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant transferred 06.76 perches of the said portion of land to her

daughter the 3rd defendant and the 3rd defendant, mortgaged the undivided portion of land in

extent 06.76 perches, to the 4th defendant bank.

The plaintiff further pleaded, that prior to the execution of the aforesaid deed in 1985, in

the year 1963, the total extent of the land was transferred to the plaintiff by one George

Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake by a deed bearing No. 9736 dated 04-07-1963 executed by

S.M.M. Cassim N.P. and the plaintiff and her family was in possession of the said land, from

such date.

In 1968, upon the plaintiffs fathers request, this land was transferred to the plaintiffs

father by the plaintiff in order to raise a loan. In 1973, the plaintiffs father died interstate and

the rights to the land vested on the heirs, namely the plaintiffs mother and the seven siblings.

The said heirs, except, the 1st defendant, in 1985, transferred their entitlement to the plaintiff by

the deed bearing No. 1457 dated 01-01-1985 referred to earlier. Thus, the plaintiff became

entitled to 13/14th share of the said land morefully referred to in schedule B to the plaint. The

plaintiff thereafter, from her share entitlement transferred an undivided portion of the land to the

2nd defendant, as referred to earlier.

5

The plaintiff in 2008, filed the instant partition action in the District Court of Puttlam

and the 1st defendant [who did not part with his entitlement of 1/14th share to the land] did not

oppose the application. The 2nd and 3rd defendants accepted the plaintiffs title and moved that

the land be partitioned as prayed for by the plaintiff. The 4th defendant bank in its statement of

claim referred to the chain of title of the parties viz-a-viz the mortgaged land.

The 5th and 6th defendants who are siblings of the plaintiff and who were also executors

to the aforesaid deed No 1457 dated 01-01-1985, filed a joint statement of claim. The 6th

defendant claimed the property and the house built therein, on the ground of prescription and

the 5th defendant claimed Rs.1.5 million for improvements, in the event the land is partitioned

as prayed for by the plaintiff.

Thus, this application was opposed only by the 5th and 6th defendants. At the trial, the

plaintiff, the Surveyor and the Notary Public who attested the aforesaid deed bearing No. 1457

gave evidence. The 5th and the 6th defendants failed to give evidence or lead any documentary

evidence to establish the plea of prescription or the claim for improvements, taken up by the said

defendants.

Having considered the evidence led and being satisfied that the plaintiff has proved the

chain of title and established the identity of the land, the District Court permitted the partitioning

of the land as prayed for by the plaintiff. The issues pertaining to prescription and improvements

raised by the 5th and 6th defendants were answered in the negative and the 5th defendants

monetary claim was rejected by the District Court.

Being aggrieved by this judgement, the 5th defendant invoked the jurisdiction of the High

Court and urged that the district judge has failed to investigate title in the said case.

It is a matter of interest, that the 5th defendant who did not claim an entitlement to the

land to be partitioned, filed appeal papers and took up an entirely new ground and abandoned

the claim for improvements pleaded before the District Court. The 6th defendant who jointly

filed a statement of claim with the 5th defendant at the trial court, did not pursue the appeal to

the High Court nor associate himself with the 5th defendants appeal.

6

The High Court accepted the contention of the 5th defendant pertaining to the title and

upheld the appeal and the case of the plaintiff was dismissed with costs and the judgement and

the interlocutory decree entered by the District Court was set aside.

The High Court, in its judgement held, that the District Court failed to perform its

obligations in terms of Section 25(1) of the Partition Law No 21 of 1997 as amended (the

Partition Act) and repeatedly pronounced that the district judge failed to address its judicial

mind to the mode of acquisition of title of Leopold De Silva Wikkramatilake the alleged

predecessor in title of the plaintiff.

Being aggrieved by this judgement, the plaintiff invoked the jurisdiction of this Court

and obtained Leave to Appeal on five questions of law.

The said questions referred to in paragraph 27(a) (b) (c) (d) and (i) of the Petition of

Appeal are as follows: -

a) Did the High Court err in deciding that examination of title is only examining paper title

excluding the title gained by prescription?

b) Did the High Court err by failing to consider that the 5th Defendant- Appellant-

Respondent is estopped in raising doubts in the title of the Plaintiff- Respondent-

Petitioner as he was also a party who executed the title deed in favor of the Plaintiff-

Respondent- Petitioner?

c) Did the High Court err in failing to appreciate the fact that no other party other than the

5th Defendant- Appellant- Respondent had appealed against the Order of the District

Court of Puttlam?

d) Did the High Court err in deciding that the evidence given in prescriptive rights accrued

by the Plaintiff- Respondent- Petitioner and her predecessors cannot be considered as a

title valid before the law?

i) Did the High Court err in deciding that paper title more than 50 years and prescriptive

title more than 50 years is insufficient to establish the title and ownership of a land?

I wish to consider the above referred five questions of law, under two segments.

7

Firstly, the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th questions of law which pertains to the plaintiffs right and

entitlement to the land to be partitioned; and

Secondly, the 3rd question which refers to the appeal filed by the 5th defendant and his

right to challenge the interlocutory decree and the judgement given by the District Court in the

instant application.

The four questions in the first segment in my view are interwoven and revolve around

the title and investigation of such title viz paper title and prescriptive title, and goes to the root

of a partition action.

Hence, I wish to analyze the questions of law raised before this Court, pertaining to title

viz-a-viz the provisions of the Partition Act, with special emphasis on investigation of title by a

court of law, as laid down in Section 25(1) of the Act.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Act reads as follows: -

.... the court shall examine the title of each party and shall hear

and receive evidence in support thereof and shall try and determine

all questions of law and fact arising in that action in regard to the

right, share or interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which

the action relates. (emphasis added)

The aforesaid provision in the present Partition Act, as well as similar provisions in the

earlier Partition Act of 1951 and the Partition Ordinances have been extensively analyzed by

this Court on numerous occasions and the duty of a court to examine and investigate title has

been repeatedly emphasized. [see Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (1957) 59 NLR 546;

Cooray v. Wijesuriya (1958) 62 NLR 158; Jane Nona v. Dingiri Mahathmaya (1968) 74

NLR 105]

With the far reaching effects of the provisions of Section 48 of the Act, which speaks of

final and conclusiveness of a partition decree, this Court has observed, that in the event the

investigations are defective, a decree could be set aside in appeal. [see Mohamedaly Adamjee

v. Hadad Sadeen (1956) 58 NLR 217]

8

Whilst observing the sacred duty of court to investigate title, the Appellate Courts have

held, that no higher standard of proof is required in a partition action than in any other civil suit,

where balance or preponderance of probability is the standard of proof and that the court could

investigate title, only within the limits of pleadings, admissions and issues and evidence led

before court and cannot go on a voyage of discovery [see Cynthia de Alwis v. Marjorie de

Alwis and others [1997] 3 Sri LR 113; Karunaratne v. Sirimalie (1951) 53 NLR 444;

Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan and others (1996) 2 Sri LR 66]

Similarly, our Courts have emphatically held that clarity with regard to the identity of

corpus is a fundamental factor to be considered in a partition application. [see SopiNona v.

Pitipanaarachchi and others (2010) 1 Sri LR 87]

With regard to a person who pivots his title on adverse possession and claims

prescription, this Court has held that such adverse possession should be established by clear and

unequivocal evidence and the burden is on the party who invokes prescription to establish such

fact. Where a person's possession was originally not adverse but subsequently, became adverse,

onus is on the person who claims that fact to prove such fact. [see De Silva v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (1973) 80 NLR 292; Sirajudeen and others v. Abbas [1994] 2

Sri LR 365]

Having referred to the legal position, pertaining to proof of title and chain of title, let me

now examine the said legal provisions, in the light of the factual matrix of this case.

In the instant appeal, the plaintiff sought to partition the land in issue, between four

parties, namely, the plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd defendants who co-owned the property in suit

and there was no contest by the said parties with regard to the partitioning of the land, identity

of the corpus and the chain of title.

As discussed earlier, the plaintiffs case was that she became entitled to the entire land to

be partitioned in extent 0A 2R 4P depicted in schedule B to the plaint, initially in the year 1963

and possessed the land from then onwards. The said land was transferred in the manner described

earlier in this judgement and in 1985 the plaintiff became entitled to an undivided 13/14th shares

9

of the said land out of which the plaintiff transferred an undivided portion of the land to the 2nd

defendant as described.

Hence, the Plaintiffs case was, that the land morefully described in schedule B to the

plaint be partitioned as prayed for in the plaint between the plaintiff, 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants

subject to the mortgage of the 4th defendant.

Thus, I cannot see any error in the judgement of the district judge permitting the

partitioning of the land in the manner prayed for by the plaintiff, after investigating the title and

being satisfied of the identity of the land and the chain of title. In fact, the district judge in the

judgement, had referred to each and every deed, in the chain of title of the plaintiff as well as

the 1st, 2nd, 3rd defendants respectively.

Similarly, the district judge cannot be faulted in disallowing the 5th and 6th defendants

claims made in the partition action either. The 5th defendant did not lead any evidence, oral or

documentary to substantiate his claim for improvements or the 6th defendant with regard to his

claim on prescription. Thus, even with regard to the contention of the 5th and 6th defendants, I

am of the view, that the district judge properly investigated their claims and rejected same.

Moreover, it is observed that both the 5th and 6th defendants were executants to the

deed bearing No. 1457 dated 01-01-1985. This is the deed by which the plaintiff obtained title

to 13/14th shares of the corpus, [when plaintiffs mother transferred her 1/2 share and the plaintiffs

seven siblings (excluding one) transferred their individual 1/14th share (1/7th of 1/2 share), being

the intestate rights and entitlements flowing from the plaintiffs deceased father.

Thus, it is ironic that the 5th defendant who transferred his share entitlement to the

plaintiff in 1985 and had no interest in the land, preferred a claim against the plaintiff, in the

event the land was partitioned, for a sum of Rs.1.5 million and thereafter failed to pursue such

claim before the trial court. The 6th defendant too, did not pursue his claim on prescription.

Further it is observed, that the 5th and 6th defendants did not challenge the chain of title of the

plaintiff either, at the trial.

10

Hence, in my view, the district judge quite rightly rejected the 5th defendants claim and

answered the issues raised by the 5th defendant as well as the 6th defendant, in the negative.

However, it is not necessary for me to delve further into this aspect of prescription and

improvements in this appeal, since the 5th defendants principal ground of appeal before the High

Court was that the District Court failed to examine the title to the land in issue. It is observed

that the High Court judge upheld the appeal upon this basis, paying much attention to the fact

that the learned District Judge failed to address the acquisition of title by the plaintiffs

predecessor.

Thus, the High Court went a step ahead and investigated the plaintiffs predecessors title

not at the time of the transfer of the land in 1963, but many years earlier and with regard to the

manner of acquisition of title by the plaintiffs predecessor. It is also a matter of concern that the

High Court did not examine the 1985 deed by which the 5th defendant and other siblings

transferred title to the plaintiff or the fact that the plaintiff, having obtained title upon the 1963

deed, held and possessed the land to be partitioned for a period of 45 years.

In the light of the findings of the High Court, I would now move on to examine the

plaintiffs title in detail.

The land to be partitioned is in extent 0A 2R 4P and is described and referred to in

schedule B to the plaint. This land is said to be a divided and defined portion of a larger land in

extent 2A 2R 20P. The larger land is referred to and described in schedule A to the plaint.

The plaintiff relied on three deeds to establish the chain of title and the identity of the

land to be partitioned.

The said deeds were;

1. Deed No.9736 executed on 04-07-1963 (P1), whereby the plaintiff became

entitled to the entire land to be partitioned, in extent 0A 2R 4P (Schedule B);

2. Deed No. 12062 executed on 06-08-1968 (P2) whereby the said extent of land

was transferred by the plaintiff to plaintiffs father; and

11

3. Deed No. 1457 executed on 01-01-1985 (P4) wherein the plaintiffs mother and

her six siblings [excluding the 1st defendant] transferred their entitlement, totaling

13/14th share to the plaintiff. The 5th and 6th defendants were also executants to this

deed.

The metes and bounds and the extent of the land referred to in the two schedules, A and

B of the plaint, correspond with the schedules referred to in the three deeds mentioned above.

The Plan and the Surveyors Report prepared on a Commission issued by the District

Court tallies with the description of the land and gives the extent and the metes and bounds as

at that date. No party to the partition action, including the 5th defendant disputed the

identification of the land, the extent and description of the land to be partitioned either by

producing oral or documentary evidence or by challenging the evidence given by the plaintiff or

on behalf of the plaintiff by the Surveyor or the Notary Public or any other witnesses. Thus, the

identity of the land to be partitioned in my view, was not in dispute before the trial court.

Similarly, the prescriptive possession of the plaintiff was also not challenged before the District

Court and that too was not in dispute.

The plaintiff also marked in evidence, the three deeds referred to above without a

challenge or objection being raised by any of the defendants, including the 5th defendant. Thus,

the said deeds which refer to the plaintiffs entitlement and the chain of title was led unhindered

and unchallenged.

Upon perusal of the aforesaid three deeds and the dates of execution, it is observed that

the chain of title clearly runs back to the year 1963, i.e., 45 years prior to filling of the partition

action.

By the deed (P1) executed in the year 1963, the title to the said corpus in extent 0A 2R

4P (morefully referred to in schedule B to the plaint) was transferred to the plaintiff by one

George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatillake, (i.e. plaintiffs predecessor) and the said George

Leopold De Silva Wikkramatilake held and possessed the said land by right of inheritance

from his mother Mary Girtrude, widow of William Moses de Silva Wikkramatilake.

12

The deed P1, further indicates that Mary Girtrude, the mother of plaintiffs predecessor,

held and possessed a larger land in extent 2A 2R 20P (morefully referred in schedule A to the

plaint), by virtue of a deed executed on 05-07-1904 bearing No. 915. The land to be partitioned

or the corpus in extent 0A 2R 4P was carved out from the southern portion of the larger land.

Thus, the paper title of the land to be partitioned can be traced back to 1904, a period exceeding

100 years, prior to filling of the instant partition action.

The plaintiff, also led in evidence a communique received from the Puttlam Land

Registry to establish that the aforesaid deed executed in 1904 had decayed. In the District Court

judgement, reference is also made to the said fact which prevented the plaintiff to mark in

evidence the deed of 1904 to establish the chain of title of the plaintiff running back to 100 years

or the beginning of the 20th century.

Thus, it is observed that the district judge took cognizance of the aforesaid facts in

investigating the title of the plaintiff and came to the correct conclusion, that the chain of title

was proved by the plaintiff, with regard to the corpus in issue.

However, as stated earlier, the High Court upheld the appeal of the 5th defendant, upon

the basis, that the plaintiff has failed to address the acquisition of title by the plaintiffs

predecessor.

It is observed that the High Court judge when coming to the above conclusion held, in

the light of the ratio in Cooray v. Wijesinghe (supra) that the plaintiff failed to adduce clear and

unequivocal evidence to prove the following factors.

- the corpus was 1/5th part of the larger land;

- Mary Girtrude was the sole owner of the larger land;

- Mary Girtrude sold and transferred an undivided 1/5th share of the larger land to

George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake the alleged predecessor in title of the

plaintiff; and

- the alleged predecessor of the plaintiff, acquired exclusive title by prescription

to the corpus, to the exclusion of other co-owners and therefore became the sole

owner of the portion of land referred to in schedule B to the plaint.

13

It is further observed, that the High Court judge elaborated the above factors at great

length and came to the finding, that the plaintiff could succeed in the partition action, only if the

plaintiff could establish the entire pedigree beginning from Mary Girtrude and continuously used

the term alleged predecessor when referring to George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake,

contrary to the contents and wording in the 1963 deed (P1) which clearly denotes him being the

vendor and the plaintiffs predecessor.

Similarly, the High Court also failed or did not venture to examine or consider the

evidential value of the deed executed in the year 1963 by the plaintiffs predecessor or the rights

and entitlements flowing from the said deed, especially the prescriptive rights and possession of

the plaintiff of the said land from the year 1963 running into a period of 45 years.

In any event, the High Court did not examine or consider the effect and consequences of

the other deeds, executed after 1963 and marked in evidence at the trial and especially the deed

bearing No. 1457 executed on 01-01-1985 (P4) by which the 5th defendant himself (the appellant

before the High Court) transferred his share entitlement together with his siblings to his own

sister, the plaintiff. The High Court failed to evaluate the stand of the 5th defendant at the trial

court i.e., not to challenge the partition action but only to obtain a monetary sum in the event the

land was partitioned.

Further, it is observed, having failed to refer to the aforesaid deeds and its effects on the

title of the plaintiffs pedigree, viz plaintiff paper title and prescriptive title to the land from

1963, the High Court Judge repeats, ad nauseam and harps on the fact that the learned district

judge has totally failed and not given his judicial mind to investigate title and obligations

imposed on him under Section 25(1) of the Partition Act and only emphasizes on the fact that

the acquisition of title by the plaintiffs predecessor has not been proved before the trial court. This Court in Cooray v. Wijesuriya (supra) and other cases discussed earlier in this

judgement, observed that Section 25(1) of the Partition Act imposes an obligation on the court

to examine the title of each party to, of, or in the land, to which the action relates.

In the instant application, the trial court referred to the title of each party to, of, or in the

land to which the action relates, during the last 45 years, i.e. the deed executed in 1963 (P1), the

14

deed executed in 1985 (P4), the deed executed by the plaintiff when transferring an undivided

portion to the 2nd defendant, the deed executed by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants respectively.

The High Court on the other hand, did not refer to the district judges examination of title,

especially in relation to the deeds marked P1, P2 or P4, but faulted the trial judge for not

examining the acquisition of title of the plaintiffs predecessor, which would have taken place

very much prior to the execution of the 1963 deed (P1).

Thus, in my view the High Court did not refer to the District Court finding on the corpus,

the ownership and title of the land in issue or the legal status of the parties before court, but

ventured to examine the position prior to 50 years i.e. prior to execution of the 1963 deed (P1).

The High Court paid more emphasis on the status of the plaintiffs predecessor and his exclusive

title to the corpus, to the exclusion of other co-owners, who are not parties to this action. The

said co-owners have no interest in the corpus nor are parties who challenged or intervened in

this action. The High Court also failed to address its mind to the prescriptive possession of the

plaintiff or the rights accrued by the plaintiff from 1963 to the date of partition action i.e. a period

of 45 years, but went onto hold that the plaintiffs pedigree should begin from, George Leopold

de Silva Wikkramatilakes mother, Mary Girtrude and plaintiff should establish that Mary

Girtrude sold and transferred the land to George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake.

In Karunaratne v. Sirimalie (supra) and Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan and others

referred to earlier in this judgement, the Appellate Courts observed, that no higher standard of

proof is required in a partition action than in any civil proceeding and the court could investigate

title, only within a limited sphere and cannot go on a voyage of discovery. Thus, the standard of

proof is the balance of probability with regard to the evidence led before the trial court.

Having considered the aforesaid judicial pronouncements and the evidence led and the

documents marked at the trial in the instant matter, I am convinced that the district judge

investigated the title of each and every party before court, i.e. the plaintiff and the 1st to 6th

defendants with regard to the corpus and came to a correct conclusion.

On the other hand, the High Court, in my view went on a voyage of discovery and upheld

the appeal, paying much attention of the plaintiffs predecessor, George Leopold de Silva

15

Wikkramatilakes title, his mother Mary Girtrudes title and the plaintiffs failure to adduce

evidence with regard to plaintiffs predecessor acquiring title to the corpus way before 1963, an

event which would have occurred 50 years prior to the plaintiff initiating partition proceedings

before the District Court.

In a partition action, according to judicial pronouncements discussed at the beginning of

this judgement, what is required from a trial court is to investigate and examine title of each

party to the land to which the action relates. In the instance matter, as discussed above, the

plaintiffs chain of title together with prescriptive title running back to 50 years, in my view, has

been clearly and fairly established. Similarly, no party has raised or adverted to any adverse

possession or prescriptive rights as against the rights and interests of the plaintiff. Thus, I see no

merit in the submission made by the 5th defendant before this Court.

Nevertheless, in view of the finding of the High Court that acquisition of the plaintiffs

predecessors title is the most crucial element in a partition action, I wish to delve into the said

fact now.

The land to be partitioned in extent 0A 2R 4P (the land referred to in schedule B to the

plaint) was transferred to the plaintiff by George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake by deed

bearing No.9736 executed on 04-07-1963 (P1).

The recital to the deed reads:

that the vendor sold and transferred the land and premises held

and possessed by the said vendor by right of inheritance from his

mother Mary Girtrude wife of William Moses de Silva

Wickramatileke late of Puttlam who held same under and by virtue

of deed No 915 dated 05-07-1904...

The schedule of the deed reads;

that of all that land called and known as Amankkangkadu situate

at Kuruvikulam in Puttlam Pattu [....] bounded on [....] containing

in extent 2A 2R 20P, in lieu of an undivided share a divided

16

southern portion of the aforesaid land divided with the mutual

consent of the other co-owners containing in extent 2R 4P and

bounded on [....].

The plain reading of the above narrative in the deed executed in 1963 (P1), appears to be that,

- the larger land referred to in schedule A to the plaint was owned and possessed by

Mary Girtrude by virtue of a deed executed in the year 1904 [i.e. the deed that is now

decayed - vide (P1a), the communique issued by the Puttlam Land Registry];

- George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake held and possessed the said land, upon

the right of inheritance of his mother, Mary Girtrude, together with other

beneficiaries and thus co-owned the said land;

- George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilakes entitlement to the said co-owned land

was 1/5th share;

- in lieu of George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilakes 1/5th share to the said larger

land, with the mutual consent of the other co-owners, a portion to the south of the

land was carved out and such carved out area was held and possessed by George

Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake;

- the said carved out portion of the land is defined by metes and bounds and is in extent

of 0A 2R 4P and is the land referred to in schedule B to the plaint; and

- the said defined portion of the land was transferred by George Leopold de Silva

Wikkramatileke (plaintiffs predecessor) to the plaintiff by deed bearing No 9736

executed on 04-07-1963 (P1).

Thus, in my view, the said deed executed in 1963 establishes the title of the plaintiffs

predecessor to the land to be partitioned. This deed (P1) was led in evidence without any

objection at the trial and the district judge pivoted the chain of title of the plaintiff with reference

to this deed.

Similarly, there was no challenge to the prescriptive right of the plaintiff who held and

possessed the said land, from the date of execution of the deed (P1) i.e. from 04-07-1963 for a

17

period of 45 years. Undisputedly, by the deed executed in 1985 (P4), the 5th defendant himself

granted his share of interest in the land to the plaintiff and did not put forward a case of adverse

possession viz-a-viz the plaintiff.

Thus, I see no reason to cast any doubt with regard to the plaintiffs predecessors title or

to burden the plaintiff to establish the manner upon which the plaintiffs predecessor acquired

title.

I am of the view that the judges of the High Court erred with regard to this factor, when

it held, in order for the plaintiff to succeed, the plaintiff should establish the entire pedigree

beginning from Mary Girtrude and that Mary Girtrude was the sole owner of the larger land

and that Many Girtrude had sufficient title vested in her to sell and transfer1/5th share or part

therefrom to George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake.

The High Court, further erred when it proclaimed that the plaintiff should establish that

George Leopold de Silva Wikkramatilake acquired or prescribed to 1/5th share of the larger land,

to the exclusion of other co-owners who owned 4/5th share and if the deed executed in 1904

was decayed, that the plaintiff should have led encumbrance sheets maintained at Puttlam Land

Registry and the failure to prove the pedigree would inevitably result in the dismissal of the

plaint.

I find the above reasoning of the High Court erroneous, misconceived, incomprehensible

and outrageous and with respect, I cannot agree with the said finding.

The obligation imposed on a court by the Partition Act, I emphasize, is to examine the

title of each party to, of, or in the land to which the action relates viz identification of corpus and

chain of title and the District Court has full-filled such obligation and allotted shares accordingly.

The High Court sitting in appeal has not considered the relevant legal position and case

law relating to such factors, but gone on a voyage of discovery, chartering through archaic

history and going beyond the pleadings, to dismiss an application based on the failure to

investigate acquisition of plaintiffs predecessors title and has thus, in my view missed the wood

for the trees.

18

This Court has time and time again held, that a party cannot be permitted to present in

appeal, a case different from that presented before the trial court where matters of fact are

involved which were not in issue at the trial. [see Candappa nee Bastian v.

Ponnambalampillai (1993) 1 Sri LR 184; Setha v. Weerakoon (1948) 49 NLR 225]

Civil Procedure Code in the explanation to Section 150 of the Code states, that a case

enunciated must reasonably accord with the partys pleadings.

Thus, the basis upon which the 5th defendant filed appeal papers and the extent to which

the High Court judge traversed to uphold the appeal, in my view is not in accordance with the

law and specifically the provisions of the Partition Act, which only requires a trial court to

consider relevant and material evidence with regard to title of each party to the land to which

the action relates.

Therefore, in my view, the High Court erred in its determination pertaining to

examination of title of parties in the instant case.

In the aforesaid circumstances, I answer the 1st, 2nd,4th and 5th Questions of Law raised

before this Court in the affirmative and in favour of the appellant.

Similarly, there is not an iota of doubt, that it was only the 5th defendant who went up in

appeal against the judgement of the District Court and the 5th defendant did not claim any share

of the land to be partitioned or any right in the District Court. Hence, the 3rd Question of Law

raised before this Court, is also answered in the affirmative and in favour of the appellant.

Thus, I answer all five Questions of Law raised before this Court in favour of the

appellant.

Therefore, for reasons enumerated herein, the judgement of the Civil Appellate High

Court holden in Kurunegala dated 13th October, 2016 is set aside.

The judgement of the District Court of Puttlam dated 23rd April, 2012 is upheld. The

Order allowing the partitioning of the land described in schedule B to the plaint, in the manner

referred to in the said judgement of the District Court is also affirmed.

19

In the aforesaid circumstances this Court further holds, that the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellant is entitled to a sum of Rs. 100,000/= payable by the 5th Defendant-Appellant-

Respondent. This sum is payable to the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant in addition to the costs

of the courts below.

Appeal is allowed with costs.
