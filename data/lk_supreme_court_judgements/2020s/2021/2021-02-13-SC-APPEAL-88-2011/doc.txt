DECIDED ON: 13.02.2021.

SISIRA J. DE ABREW, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. This is an appeal

against the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 15.11.2010. This

Court by its order dated 29.06.2011 granted Leave to Appeal on questions of

law set out in paragraph 21 (i), (ii) and (iii) of the Petition of Appeal dated

21.12.2010 which are set out below,

1. Has not the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo erred in

law and fact in setting aside that the consent decree which had

been entered without precision of the corpus?

2. Have the honorable Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal erred

in law and fact in affirming the consent decree which had been

entered without a subject matter (the roadway) being ascertained

in terms of law?

3. Have the honorable Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal

misconceived in law and fact in concluding that the roadway is

depicted in Plan bearing No.829?

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows;

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondent) filed a case in the District Court of Colombo stating that

his roadway has been blocked by the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Appellant). The parties

entered into a settlement. The learned District Judge entered the consent

decree on the terms of settlement suggested by the parties. The consent decree

of the learned District Judge contained the following conditions;

This consent decree was entered on 17.08.2006. After the consent decree was

entered the Defendant-Appellant filed papers in the District Court to vacate the

said consent decree. Then the learned District Judge by order dated

29.06.2009 vacated the consent decree.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge dated

29.06.2009 the Plaintiff-Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court.

The Civil Appellate High Court by its judgment dated 15.11.2010 set aside the

said order of the learned District Judge dated 29.06.2009. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court the Defendant-Appellant

has appealed to this Court.

The main argument of the learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant is that

there is no corpus in this case. Therefore, he contends that the consent decree

was a mistake. I now advert to this contention. Was there a mistake in the

consent decree? Learned Counsel contended that there is no corpus in this

case. But the Defendant-Appellant in paragraph 4 of his amended answer

dated 14.02.2006 has admitted that there is an access road. Thus, the

contention of learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant that there is no

corpus fails in limine. Further, the Defendant-Appellant in the consent decree

has admitted that there is an access road. Thus, even on the basis of condition

SC.Appeal No.88/2011

6

No.2 of the consent decree, the contention of learned Counsel fails. Therefore,

the contention that there was a mistake in the consent decree is hereby

rejected.

In the case of Gunasekara Vs. Leelawathie Srikantha Law Report Volume 5

page 86 Court of Appeal held as follows;

“A compromise decree is but a contract with the command of a judge

superseded to it. It can therefore be set aside on any of the grounds, such

as fraud, mistake, misrepresentation etc., on which a contract may be set

aside.”

The main argument of the learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant is that

there was a mistake in the consent decree. I have rejected the said contention.

Thus, applying the principle laid down in the case of Gunasekara Vs.

Leelawathie (supra), I hold that the learned District Judge could not have set

aside the consent decree in this case. We therefore hold that the learned Judge

was in error when he set aside the consent decree. For the above reasons, we

answer the 1st question of law as follows,

“The learned District Judge has erred in law”.

We answer the 2nd question of law in the negative. The 3rd question of law does

not arise for consideration. For the above reasons, we hold that the learned

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court were correct when they set aside the

learned District Judge’s order dated 29.06.2009.

For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of the learned Judges

of the Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at

SC.Appeal No.88/2011

Rs100,000/-. In addition to this cost the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to

recover the cost ordered by the Civil Appellate High Court.

Appeal dismissed.
