Thus, the evidence led indicates that the Plaintiff went abroad to the United Kingdom, a country that considered the age of majority as 18 years at that time, as a minor and stayed there and, by the time he executed the Power of Attorney, had started a business of his own in export and import of vehicles.

The said issues, even though contemplate on the status of the Plaintiff as a minor, does not limit that status to the age of the Plaintiff or has no reference to his date of birth. Thus, in my view, when deciding whether the Plaintiff was a minor or not, the learned District Judge had no limitation to consider whether he was emancipated from that status at the time of the execution of the said Power of Attorney. Thus, there were evidence to say that even at the time of granting the Power of Attorney to his father, the 2nd Defendant, the plaintiff has the capacity to enter into contracts as a person who was emancipated from his status as a minor, and, as such, the power of attorney was valid from the beginning.",

Silva 15 NLR 286 it was held; \u201cthe Roman Dutch Law of ratification of contracts by a minor is in force in Ceylon. Contracts which are neither certainly to a minor\u2019s prejudice nor necessarily for his benefit are neither void nor absolutely valid, but are voidable and capable of conformation after majority.\u201d As per the case at hand, it is clear from the evidence that the Plaintiff after becoming a major entered into an Agreement to Purchase no.1976 dated 2nd may 1984 with the seller of the land in dispute through his power of attorney holder, the 2nd Defendant, using the same impugned Power of Attorney. It appears that the said agreement No.1976 has been marked as V1 at the trial without objection -vide page 791 of the brief, and, even though the power of attorney holder for the plaintiff for the purposes of the case at hand, who gave evidence for the plaintiff at the beginning, had said that he was not aware of such agreement, later has admitted that the Plaintiff used the impugned power of attorney to buy and sell the land in dispute - vide pages 794 and 811of the brief. No objection has been raised to this V 1 agreement at the closure of the Defendant\u2019s case -vide page 859 of the brief. Thus, it is clear, as per the evidence, the Plaintiff after becoming a major treated the impugned Power of Attorney as a valid one and used it to enter into agreements. Therefore, by his conduct as a major, he has ratified the impugned Power of Attorney and used it for his benefit. He cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate to say that, in relation to deed no.60, it is not a valid Power of Attorney. As mentioned above, when he entered into the said agreement to purchase and the impugned sale of the land through his power of attorney holder, the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiff was not a minor to say that agreements which are detriment to a minor are not valid against him. Hence, even if one argues that the impugned Power of Attorney was not valid since the Plaintiff was a minor as at the date it was given to his father, the deed no 60 by which the Power of Attorney holder sold it to the 1st Defendant cannot be challenged on that ground since by the time Deed no.60 was executed, the impugned power of attorney was valid due to the subsequent ratification by his own conduct by the Plaintiff as a major.

    "text": "plaintiff executed the impugned Power of Attorney when he was 19 and for the benefit of his business in Sri Lanka. The existence of this power of attorney was within his knowledge when he reached the age of 21. Instead of taking steps to revoke it, he had used it for his benefit after attaining majority. This court also observes that the Power of Attorney was a contract of agency which was entered into for the benefit of the Plaintiff to carry on his business in Sri Lanka, that is to say that it was for the improvement or maintenance of his business in Sri Lanka without rendering it to a worse position. Even though there is no evidence to show that it was used during his purported minority, it is clear it was used for his benefit in entering into the contract marked V1 after becoming a major. Thus, even for the sake of argument if one considers that the Plaintiff was not emancipated from his position as a minor when he gave the impugned Power of Attorney to his father, the Power of Attorney was executed for his benefit and has been ratified by his own conduct after he became a major and the impugned deed no 60 was executed after such ratification. However, it appears that on behalf of the Plaintiff there is an attempt to show that subsequent ratification was neither pleaded nor put in issue. This court observes that even though the word \u2018ratification\u2019 was not used, it is pleaded in the answer that the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming that the Power of Attorney was not valid in that he took no steps to revoke it and received benefits under the Power of Attorney. Issue No .25 had been raised accordingly. Even though, the word \u2018ratification\u2019 was not used, in fact this issue put in issue whether the Plaintiff is estopped from denying the validity of the Power of Attorney since he has gained benefit from the Power of Attorney. What this court find in the above analysis is that even after becoming a major, the Plaintiff has used the Power of Attorney for his benefit which amounts to ratification and in turn which estops him from denying the validity of the Power of Attorney. Furthermore, that the Plaintiff\u2019s conduct, as a major, amounts to approbation and reprobation with regard to the validity of the power of attorney. As indicated above, after becoming a major, the Plaintiff used the Power of Attorney to enter into an agreement to buy the same property treating it as a valid document.

By this the Plaintiff attempts to argue that power to sell the impugned property was not given by the impugned Power of Attorney and, thus the transaction in deed no. 60 was not valid and, as such, the deeds written on the strength of the said deed no. 60 also are not valid. In this regard the Plaintiff argues that even though the impugned Power of Attorney bearing No. 1482 appears to be a General Power of Attorney, it is given with reference to a particular purpose and, as such, it is a Power of Attorney given for special particular purpose and thus, the general clauses contained in the said power of attorney will become inoperative and will not authorize the holder of the power of attorney to do any act under the said general provisions.

Though the Plaintiff complained that there is collusive relationship among 1st,3rd and 4th defendants, this court observes that no substantial prayer is sought against the 2nd Defendant in this case and no evidence was led to show that the Plaintiff has taken sufficient steps against the 2nd Defendant, namely to prosecute the 2nd Defendant in a criminal action or to gain compensation in a civil action. This indicates that the collusion may lie somewhere else.",

Neither of them was a party or a witness to the impugned deed no.60. Thus, they are not eligible witnesses to say anything about the consideration unless as hearsay that came to their knowledge from other sources. Furthermore, Hewage Sirisena has not uttered anything regarding the consideration in relation to deed no.60. In fact, when said Reginald Perera Wickramarachchi was questioned in this regard on 22/06/2000 at page 7 of that day\u2019s proceedings (page 759 of the brief) as to whether the father of the plaintiff (2nd Defendant) was given any money by the 1st defendant on this transaction and his answer had been that he did not know. Thus, there was no reliable evidence to show that no consideration was paid for the transaction contemplated in deed no.60. On the other hand, if he does not know how much was paid at the transaction how can he be a reliable witness to say that the amount paid was less than half of the value and thus, doctrine of laesio enormis applies. It is true that the consideration mentioned in deed no.60 (P5) is Rs. 800000.00 and this witness states in his evidence that the true value of the land in 1985 was Rs. 5000000.00 -vide page 760 of the brief, again at page 846 of the brief, he says that it was Rs.700000.00 or 800000.00 per perch in 1985, indicating that the value of the land was around Rs.9750000.00, but it is clear from the deed no. 2085 marked P4 that the Plaintiff bought the land for Rs. 800000.00 only few months prior to the sale by deed no.60. This witness has not shown any qualification in valuation and even his stance with regard to the value at 1985 is not constant as mentioned above. There is no proper explanation, how the value mentioned in P4 in February 1985 rose up to an amount that exceeds double of that amount or to amounts mentioned by him in evidence in September 1985, that is within 7 months period. He tried to explain this by saying that correct",

On the other hand, doctrine of laesio enormis does not ipso facto make the deed void. It is used to rescind the contract. For that there is no prayer in the plaint to declare that deed no.60 is void. Thus, the claim of the Plaintiff that the deed no.60 was void on the grounds of not paying the consideration and laesio enormis should fail. It is questionable whether the plaintiff could on one hand saying that the consideration was not paid and on the other state that what was paid as consideration is less than half the value of the true value, since it amounts to approbation and reprobation. However, I need not go into that issue, since, it is clear those positions were not established factually. Even though, the learned District Judge had answered an issue to indicate that it was not proved that the consideration for P5, deed no. 60 was paid, as discussed above there was no acceptable evidence to come to that conclusion against what is mentioned in and evidenced by the deed itself. It is also observed that there was no evidence to establish that the 1st Defendant, 3rd Defendant and the 4th Defendant acted fraudulently.",
