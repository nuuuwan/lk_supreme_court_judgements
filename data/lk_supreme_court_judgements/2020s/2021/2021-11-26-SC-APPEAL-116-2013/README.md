Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action seeking a declaration of title to the land

described in the schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant

therefrom and damages. The defendant filed answer seeking

dismissal of the action. After trial the District Court entered

judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court affirmed it.

This appeal is from the judgment of the High Court. This court

granted leave to appeal on the following two questions of law:

(a) Did the District Court err in entering judgment despite the

plaintiff failing to discharge the burden that his title deeds

relate to the land occupied by the defendant?

(b) Did the High Court fail to appreciate that the District Court

entered judgment for the plaintiff notwithstanding the plaintiff

failed to identify the corpus?

5

In essence, leave to appeal was granted on the question whether the

land in suit has been properly identified.

The identification of the land is of paramount importance for the

plaintiff to succeed in a rei vindicatio action. The examination of title

does not arise until the land which the plaintiff claims title to is

properly identified. The burden is on the plaintiff, not on the

defendant, to identify the land in suit.

In this case, the defendant who is in possession of the land known

as “Millagahawatta” did not contest the plaintiff’s title deeds.

Throughout the action her position was that the plaintiff’s title deeds

relate to a different land, not to the land which she is in possession

of. The defendant clearly stated in her answer that she purchased

lots 1, 2, 3 and 5 in plan No. 1067/1967 of 25.04.1967 by deed No.

34 of 25.11.1970 and she is in possession of that land. Admittedly

that land is different from the land the plaintiff claims title to and

seeks the ejectment of the defendant from. The defendant attached

a copy of her title deed (D1) and a copy of the plan (D2) to the answer,

and the originals were produced at the trial. Her transferor’s title

deed (P19) also identifies the land according to the said old plan.

The land the defendant claims title to as described in these deeds is

as follows:

All that divided and defined parcel of land called

Millagahawatta comprising of Lots 1, 2, 3 and 5 (excluding Lot

4) depicted in Plan No. 1067/1967 dated 25th April 1967 made

by H.L. Croos Da Brera, Licensed Surveyor situated at

Thihariya in the Meda Pattu of Siyane Korale in the District of

Colombo (now Gampaha) Western Province and bounded on the

North the land of P.L. Mumeena Umma and Lot 4 shown on the

said Plan No.1067/1967 on the East by the P.W.D. Road from

6

Warapalana to Thihariya on the South by land of A.T. Razeem

and others and on the West by land of C.L. Abdul Samad, land

of A.L. Segu Mohomed and others and land of U.L. Abdul

Rahiman containing in extent one Acre Three Roods Two

Perches (A1. R3. P2) according to the said Plan No. 1067/1967.

It is clear from the above description that “Millagahawatta” is a

larger land and the defendant claims a divided and defined potion of

that larger land.

The plaintiff purchased his land, a portion of “Millagahawatta”,

about 22 years after the defendant had purchased her land. The

land described in the schedule to the plaint as described in the

plaintiff’s title deed No. 6952 of 06.09.1992 (P8) is as follows:

Southern portion of Millagahawatta situated at Thihariya in the

Meda Pattu of Siyane Korale in the District of Gampaha of the

Western Province bounded on the North by a portion of the same

land belonging to Ali Lebbe Pakir Lebbe, on the East by cart

road to Thihariya, on the South by Dangaha Ovita belonging to

Ali Thambi Lebbe Ama Lebbe, on the West although it says

Ovita belonging to Ahamadu Lebbe Ali Lebbe and others, in

fact, the land belonging to Ali Thambi Machcham Ahamadu

Lebbe Machcham in extent 1A 3R 0P.

It is clear from the above description also that “Millagahawatta” is a

larger land and the plaintiff claims a portion (“southern portion”) of

the larger land (1 acre and 2 roods), and that portion is bounded on

the north by a portion of the larger land.

There is no plan prepared to identify this portion of land at or before

the execution of the plaintiff’s deed or after the institution of this

7

action despite the defendant having raised the issue of identification

of the land at the earliest possible opportunity.

The plaintiff marked the title deeds of his predecessors in title.

According to the schedule to the first deed No. 16855 marked P2,

“Millagahawatta” comprises more than 10 acres.

The transferor of the plaintiff’s deed No. 6952 (P8), Riyal, became

entitled to the land by deed of gift No. 2934 (P7) from his father,

Shariiff. Shariiff became entitled to the land by deed No. 23381 (P6).

It is to be noted that although Shariiff gifted the entire southern

portion of “Millagahawatta” within those boundaries in extent of 1

acre and 2 roods by P7, according to deed P6 Shariiff had got only

an undivided 2/3 share of that portion.

Learned President’s counsel for the plaintiff quoting Balasooriya v.

Neelakanthi [2017] BLR 202 and Punchiappuhamy v. Dingiribanda

[2016] BLR 40 contends that if a plaintiff claims the entire land but

establishes title to a portion of the land, he is entitled to have the

trespasser ejected from the entire land. In these two cases there was

no question of identification of the land whereas in the instant case

the issue is the identification of the plaintiff’s land on the ground.

Hence those two cases are inapplicable here.

The plaintiff admits that the plaintiff’s land is registered at the Land

Registry in one folio (page 384 of the brief) and the defendant’s land

is registered in a different folio (page 473).

During the course of the argument, learned President’s Counsel for

the plaintiff stated that the question of identification of the land can

be addressed at the execution of the decree and the fiscal can obtain

the assistance of a surveyor to identify the land and hand over

possession to the plaintiff. I am afraid I cannot agree. In the

8

execution of the decree the fiscal cannot purport to identify the land

in order to eject the defendant from it when the defendant has

contested the case of the plaintiff on the premise that she is not in

possession of the land described in the schedule to the plaint. Under

such circumstances, in the first place, there is no executable decree.

(David v. Gnanawathie [2000] 2 Sri LR 352, Gunasekera v.

Punchimenike [2002] 2 Sri LR 43)

The District Judge entered judgment for the plaintiff on the basis

that the land claimed by the plaintiff is different from the land

claimed by the defendant. If the solution is so straightforward, the

District Judge could have entered judgment for the plaintiff with

consent soon after the defendant filed the answer because the

defendant categorically stated in her answer that the land claimed

by the plaintiff is different from the land claimed by the defendant:

in fact, that is her defence against ejectment from the land and

rightly so.

The High Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court on the

grounds that (a) the defendant has not been in possession of “the

land in suit”; (b) the plaintiff has established title to the land

described in the schedule to the plaint; and (c) “the defendant has

failed to identify the land he claims and prove his title to the same.”

The High Court states the defendant has not been in possession of

the land in suit. What is “the land in suit”? Has it been identified

on the ground? This is the pivotal issue before court. The defendant

need not prove that she is not in possession of the land described in

the schedule to the plaint. The onus lies on the plaintiff to prove his

case. As I stated previously, the defendant at the first opportunity

tendered a copy of her plan and stated that she is not in possession

of the land the plaintiff claims title to. Then the burden is on the

9

plaintiff who filed the action to eject the defendant from the land to

take out a commission to prepare a plan to depict the land he claims

and to superimpose the defendant’s plan thereon. This has not been

done.

If the plaintiff fails to identify the land he claims dominium over, his

action must fail. In the instant case the defendant has a strong

case: she has title deeds, a plan and she is in possession of the land.

She is presumed to have title to the land she is in possession of, and

it was for the plaintiff to rebut that presumption which he has failed

to do. (Peeris v. Savunhamy (1951) 54 NLR 207)

Marsoof, J. in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 378 stated:

The identity of the subject matter is of paramount importance in

a rei vindicatio action because the object of such an action is to

determine ownership of the property, which objective cannot be

achieved without the property being clearly identified. Where

the property sought to be vindicated consists of land, the land

sought to be vindicated must be identified by reference to a

survey plan or other equally expeditious method. It is obvious

that ownership cannot be ascribed without clear identification

of the property that is subjected to such ownership, and

furthermore, the ultimate objective of a person seeking to

vindicate immovable property by obtaining a writ of execution

in terms of Section 323 of the Civil Procedure Code will be

frustrated if the fiscal to whom the writ is addressed, cannot

clearly identify the property by reference to the decree for the

purpose of giving effect to it. It is therefore essential in a

vindicatory action, as much as in a partition action, for the

corpus to be identified with precision.

10

I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted

in the affirmative and set aside the judgments of the District Court

and the High Court and allow the appeal. The plaintiff’s action shall

stand dismissed. The defendant is entitled to costs in all three

courts.
