The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Embilipitiya

seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the first

schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant from a portion

thereof as described in the second schedule to the plaint, and

damages. The defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiffs

action. After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs

action on the basis that the plaintiff failed to prove title to the

land. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of

the District Court. This appeal by the plaintiff is from the

judgment of the Court of Appeal.

This Court granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on the

following two questions of law:

As there was an erroneous observation by the trial judge as

to deed P16 should the Court of Appeal have returned the

matter back to the District Court to adjudicate on the issue

4

SC/APPEAL/208/2014

of prescription as the District Court had not explained the

issue?

When the Court of Appeal finds that the plaintiff is entitled

to share of the corpus only, could a declaration be

granted to the said share and order eviction of the

trespasser as the trial Court has not held that the

defendant has prescribed to the land or has paper title as

he stands in the shoes of a trespasser?

The plaintiff filed this action on the basis that he is the paper

title holder of the land described in the first schedule to the

plaint by deed marked P1 from his father. The District Judge

rightly concluded that P1 cannot be relied upon as the plaintiff

did not prove how his father had obtained title to the land in

order for the father to have conveyed it to the plaintiff, since

mere execution of deeds does not confer title.

During the course of his evidence, the plaintiff stated that his

father got title to the land by deed No. 12205. According to the

proceedings of the District Court, this deed had not been

marked in evidence and therefore the District Judge stated that

it had not been produced. But as the Court of Appeal correctly

notes in its judgment, this deed is available in the brief marked

P16 and there is an error in recording the proceedings.

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal does not state that the

plaintiffs father obtained title to the land by P16. What the

Court of Appeal states is Even if P16 is considered as having

conveyed title to the father of the plaintiff, yet he is only entitled to

an undivided share of the subject matter. This cannot be

5

SC/APPEAL/208/2014

interpreted to mean that the Court of Appeal came to the definite

finding that the plaintiffs father became entitled to an undivided

share of the land by virtue of P16 and that this share was

transferred by P1 to the plaintiff.

As the Court of Appeal has remarked, there is no mention of P16

in P1 as the source of title of the transferor. In P1, the plaintiffs

father traces his title to an order delivered in a section 66

application under the Primary Courts Procedure Act to which

the defendant was not a party. Even if this is correct, the

Primary Court does not decide on ownership of the land but only

on possession.

Moreover, perusal of P16 reveals that it has nothing to do with

the land the plaintiff claims title to in the instant action. The

land in suit is known as Baddawewe Udakella alias Udakella

but there is no such land described in the schedule to P16.

The position of the defendant is that this is state land. The

plaintiff also stated in cross examination that the Mahaweli

Authority took preliminary steps to issue permits in respect of

this land but the permits were never issued. His evidence on

this question is not clear.

By the aforesaid first question of law, the plaintiff seeks to remit

the case to the District Court for adjudication on the issue of

prescription upon P16 being available in the case record. This

has no meaning. There is no correlation between P16 and the

plea of prescription.

SC/APPEAL/208/2014

What is this prescriptive title the plaintiff claims? Whilst stating

that he is the owner of the land by deed P1, the plaintiff by issue

number 3 states that he has acquired prescriptive title to the

land by undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possession

against the defendant for well over ten years. Does this mean

the plaintiff considers the defendant the true owner of the land?

The plaintiff filed this case on the basis that the defendant

forcibly entered his land described in the schedule to the plaint

on a particular day about one year before the institution of the

action. The plaintiffs plea of prescription is intrinsically

inconsistent and unsustainable.

Both the District Court and the Court of Appeal have correctly

concluded that the plaintiff has not proved title to the land.

I answer both questions of law in the negative and dismiss the

appeal of the plaintiff but without costs.
