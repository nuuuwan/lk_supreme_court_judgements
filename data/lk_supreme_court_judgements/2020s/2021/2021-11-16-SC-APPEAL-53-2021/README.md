Argued on: 04 - 08 - 2021

P. Padman Surasena J

The Plaintiff - Appellant - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs) filed the plaint

dated 17-04-2012 in the District Court of Negombo praying inter alia for a declaration that the

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) is not entitled to use

as a right of way, Lot 5 and Lot 4 depicted in Plan No. 1177 dated 13-04-1982, prepared by R. I.

Fernando Licensed Surveyor (hereinafter referred to as the Plan No. 1177). The said Lots are

more fully described respectively in the 5th and 6th schedules to the plaint. According to the Plan

No. 1177, the said Lots 5 and 4 jointly make a roadway to gives access to Lots 2 and 3 depicted

in the same Plan, from St. Josephs Street.

The 1st Plaintiff occupies Lot 1; the 2nd Plaintiff occupies Lot 2; and the Defendant occupies Lot 3

depicted in the said Plan. The said plan is a partition plan (surveyed and partitioned on 13-04-

1982) prepared to partition then existed larger land called Beligahawatta amongst the three co-

owners (siblings) at that time. The said three co-owners were firstly, Kurukulasuriya Maria Hema

Celsia Fernando (the 1st Plaintiff), secondly, Kurukulasuriya Philip Antony Roshan Fernando and

thirdly, Kurukulasuriya Micheal Joseph Rohan Fernando. The said three co-owners are the children

of Kurukulasuriya Micheal Fester Fernando (father) and Kurukulasuriya Mary Melverin Florence

Fernando (mother) who had owned the said larger land by virtue of deed No. 5121 attested on

02-05-1956 by P.D.F.de Croos Notary Public.

After the partition plan No. 1177 was prepared, the three co-owners executed the Deed of

Partition bearing No. 404 dated19-02-1983, attested by M John Andrew Fabian Tissera Notary

Public. According to the plaint, by virtue of the said Deed of Partition No. 404, the 1st Plaintiff

became the owner of Lot 1; Kurukulasuriya Philip Antony Roshan Fernando became the owner of

Lot No. 2; and Kurukulasuriya Micheal Joseph Rohan Fernando became the owner of Lot No. 3.

Thereafter, Kurukulasuriya Philip Antony Roshan Fernando by virtue of deed No, 42 attested on

16-08-1994 by G. A. L. Palitha Dammika Silva Notary Public, transferred Lot 2, to the 1st Plaintiff.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 4 of 16

Thereafter the 1st Plaintiff transferred the said Lot 2, to her daughter (the 2nd Plaintiff) by deed

No. 2875 attested on 17-05-2005 by7 M. J. Basil A Tissera Notary Public.

Kurukulasuriya Micheal Joseph Rohan Fernando Transferred Lot 3 to Kaluarachchige Ignatious

Loyola Rodrigo and Wimalawathie Sangaraja by deed No. 1699 attested on 23-03-1993 by M. J.

Basil A Tissera Notary Public. Thereafter, said Kaluarachchige Ignatious Loyola Rodrigo

transferred his interest in Lot No. 3 to Wimalawathie Sangaraja by deed No. 1919 attested on 06-

12-1994 by M.J. Basil A Tissera Notary Public which made said Wimalawathie Sangaraja the sole

owner of said Lot 3. Thereafter, said Wimalawathie Sangaraja transferred Lot 3 to the Defendant

by virtue of deed No. 87279 attested on 18-01-2007 by Jayasekara Abeyruwan Notary Public

making the Defendant the present owner of Lot 3.1

The said sub division was done in such a way that only the Lot 1 would have a road frontage

from St. Josephs Street, and the remaining two blocks (Lots 2 and 3) would get access from St.

Josephs Street through Lot 5 and Lot 4 reserved as a road way in the Plan No. 1177 at the time

of the said sub division. Thus, when coming from St. Josephs Street, the first block of land one

would meet, would be Lot 1; the second block would be Lot 2; and the last block would be Lot

3. The Defendant is the person who at the moment occupies the last block i.e., Lot 3. The above

facts make it clear that both the Plaintiffs and the Defendant derive their respective titles from

one and the same source.

While the case was pending in the District Court, the Plaintiffs filed the Petition dated 25-07-2013

supported by an affidavit,2 praying for an enjoining order in the first instance and an interim

injunction, to prevent the Defendant or her agents or servants from using or obstructing the

aforesaid roadway. The Plaintiffs in their Petition have prayed inter alia;

a) for an enjoining order in the first place, preventing the Defendant from using the land

strip Lot 4 depicted in Plan No. 1177 as a right of way; preventing the Defendant from

bringing any vehicle on to the said land strip; preventing the Defendant from placing

or storing any other object on the said land strip;

b) for an interim injunction thereafter, preventing the Defendant from using the land strip

Lot 4 depicted in Plan No. 1177 as a right of way; preventing the Defendant from

1 As has been pointed out by the learned District Judge at page 3 of his order, there appear to be some confusion in mentioning the Lot No.s in the plaint. 2 The date of swearing the affidavit has not been inserted (only the month & the year has been inserted).

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 5 of 16

bringing any vehicle on to the said land strip; preventing the Defendant from placing

or storing any other object on the said land strip;

Strangely, the Plaintiffs for the reasons best known to them, had not sought/prayed to restrain

the Defendant from using Lot 5 as a road. The learned District Judge having granted the enjoining

order as prayed for, subsequently by his order dated 19-09-2014 refused to grant the interim

order, and proceeded to dissolve the enjoining order subject to a cost of Rs. 17,500.

On an appeal, the Provincial High Court by its judgment dated 08-02-2019, had set aside the

order of the learned District Judge and directed that the interim injunction be issued; hence the

Defendant has preferred this appeal.

Upon the Appellant supporting the application for leave to appeal relevant to this appeal, this

Court by its order dated 16-03-2021, had granted leave to appeal on three questions of law,3

which are to the following effect;

a. whether the High Court has failed to appreciate that the order made by the District court

refusing to grant interim injunction had been made upon a detailed analysis of the

principles of law and the matters adduced in respect of establishing a prima facie fair

chance of winning the action, the balance of convenience, and the equitable

considerations;

b. whether the High Court had come to its conclusions without any evaluation, analysis or

examination of the findings of the District court and without making its determination as

to those findings of the District court;

c. whether the High Court has failed to appreciate that there was no peril of any damage

being caused to the roofs of the buildings of the Plaintiffs by the mere user of the said

access path by the Defendant.

At the outset, I must mention that I find it difficult to follow and understand any rationale in the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge. I also have to say that no lawful reason for setting

aside the learned District Judges order, is discernible from the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge. However, if at all there is some reason, that must be found in the following two

paragraphs because only those two paragraphs, have indicated something resembling such a

reason.

3 Questions of law set out in paragraph 12 (ii), (iii), (iv) of the petition dated 21-03-2019.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 6 of 16

In this case, even if Lots No. 4 and 5 are not permitted for the Defendant to use, it

does not prejudice her as she has another road. This entire case is to determine

whether Defendants have the right for Lots No. 4 and 5 that will be the final decision

of the case. Therefore, that will be a part of the final decision. Until then, if Lots No.

4 and 5 are permitted to be used by the Defendant, there will be an irreparable loss

to the Plaintiff because they are already getting a final remedy.

According to the Plaint, it might damage to the roofs of buildings of the Plaintiffs.

Therefore, it is best to maintain the status quo of granting a permanent injunction

until the final determination of the case.

Although the Plaintiffs had only sought in their petition nothing more than an interim injunction,

the learned Provincial High Court Judge (according to the second paragraph above), had granted

a permanent injunction. However, in view of the qualification until the final determination of the

case inserted soon thereafter, I would think that it is an interim injunction and hence would not

proceed any further to discuss about that lapse in the Provincial High Courts judgment.

Nevertheless, suffice it to say that the above lapse taken along with the illogical reasoning would

still indicate the diligence with which the learned Provincial High Court Judge had dealt with this

case.

The above two paragraphs of the judgment of the Provincial High Court indicates the followings

as reasons.

i. Preventing the Defendant from using Lots No. 4 and 5 does not prejudice her as she has

another road;

ii. Determination whether the Defendant has the right for Lots No. 4 and 5 will be the final

decision of the case;

iii. If Lots No. 4 and 5 are permitted to be used by the Defendant, there will be an irreparable

loss to the Plaintiff because they are already getting a final remedy;

iv. According to the Plaint, it might damage the roofs of buildings of the Plaintiffs.

In the course of the argument, the learned counsel for the Defendant complained to this Court

that the Plaintiffs had never complained to the District Court in their pleadings that there is a

danger of damaging the roofs of the buildings of the Plaintiffs by the Defendants use of the

disputed roadway. Upon the aforesaid complaint, this Court requested the learned counsel for

the Plaintiffs to point out any averment to that effect, in the pleadings of the Plaintiffs. However,

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 7 of 16

the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs was unable to point out any such averment in the affidavit

filed by the Plaintiffs along with the application for the interim injunction. Thus, the assertion by

the learned High Court Judge that the usage of the disputed roadway by the Defendant, would

damage the roofs of the buildings of the Plaintiffs, is not supported by any evidence and hence

is a perverse conclusion. It is not a part of the case advanced by the Plaintiffs as no such averment

is found in the Petition which prayed for the interim injunction. Thus, I see no factual or legal

basis for the fourth reason mentioned above.

Neither party had moved Court at this stage to finally determine whether the Defendant has a

right for Lots No. 4 and 5. Indeed neither the learned District Judge nor the learned High Court

Judge has even attempted to decide that. Thus, the second reason given by the learned High

Court Judge is a nonexistent reason.

As regards the first reason above, the learned High Court Judge appears to have been satisfied

with the making of such a bare statement without any reference to any fact or any evidence as

against the evaluation of the evidence adduced in the inquiry by the learned District Judge which

has been set out in the District Court order. Thus, the assertion that the prevention of the use of

Lots No.4 and 5 does not prejudice the Defendant as she has another road, is a misconception

by the learned High Court Judge, which is not supported by evidence.

The third reason above, is a possibility of causing an irreparable loss to the Plaintiff. However, no

one is able to ascertain what that irreparable loss would be, or how such a loss could be caused

to the Plaintiffs, by the mere user of the disputed roadway by the Defendant.

The above observations would be sufficient for me to re-affirm my already mentioned view that

there are no lawful reasons for setting aside the learned District Judges order, discernible from

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. In my view that is sufficient to set aside the

judgment of the Provincial High Court. However, I am mindful that the correctness of the refusal

of the interim injunction by the learned District Judge would be another important consideration

that should be addressed.

Before I proceed to consider the learned District Judges order, let me glance through the law

relating to Injunctions, focusing in particular on Interim Injunctions. Interim injunction is an

equitable remedy and is not available as of right, such injunction will be granted at the discretion

of the court. The effect and the purpose of such injunction is to preserve the status quo of the

subject matter of the action until the final judgment is delivered. The Civil Procedure Code has

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 8 of 16

dedicated its Chapter XLVIII for the procedure relating to applications for injunctions. Section 662

is the first section in that Chapter which is as follows.

662. Every application for an injunction for any of the purposes mentioned in section

54 of the Judicature Act, except in cases where an injunction is prayed for in a plaint

in any action, shall be by petition, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the

applicant or some other person having knowledge of the facts, containing a statement

of the facts on which the application is based.

Section 662 is followed by few other sections in that Chapter and they form the procedure to be

followed when an application for an injunction (for any of the purposes mentioned in section 54

of the Judicature Act), is made. As has been clearly stated in section 662, the purposes for which

such injunction may be obtained are set out in section 54 of the Judicature Act. The corollary of

the above is that a Court can only grant such an injunction for the purposes set out in section 54

of the Judicature Act. This means that it is this section which vests Courts with jurisdiction to

grant such injunctions.

In the case of Alubhay Vs Mohideen,4 a case relating to an issuance of an interim injunction, De

Sampayo J stated that it was section 87 of the Courts Ordinance No. 1 of 1889 which creates the

jurisdiction of the Court to grant injunctions, and one must look to the Civil Procedure Code for

the relevant procedure. Looking back at the recent legal history of the country, one could observe

that the Courts Ordinance No. 1 of 1889 was replaced by the Administration of Justice Law No.

44 of 1973,5 and the latter was in turn replaced by the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978. This is why

in Felix Dias Bandaranayake Vs. State Film Corporation and another,6 Justice Soza stated that

generally speaking section 54 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 is the jurisdictional section

while sections 662, 664 and 666 of the Civil Procedure Code set out the procedure for granting

of injunctions. This concept has been long followed by our Courts. Thus, section 54 of the

Judicature Act states the substantive law relating to injunctions in the following manner.

Section 54:

(1) Where in any action instituted in a High Court, District Court or a Small Claims Court, it

appears-

4 18 NLR 486. 5 Jurisdiction to grant interim injunctions was in section 42 therein. 6 1981 (2) Sri L. R. 287 at page 292.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 9 of 16

(a) from the plaint that the plaintiff demands and is entitled to a judgment against

the defendant, restraining the commission or continuance of an act or nuisance,

the commission or continuance of which would produce injury to the plaintiff; or

(b) that the defendant during the pendency of the action is doing or committing or

procuring or suffering to be done or committed, or threatens or is about to do or

procure or suffer to be done or committed, an act or nuisance in violation of the

plaintiffs rights in respect of the subject matter of the action and tending to render

the judgment ineffectual, or

(c) that the defendant during the pendency of the action threatens or is about to

remove or dispose of his property with intent to defraud the plaintiff,

the Court may, on its appearing by the affidavit of the plaintiff or any other person that

sufficient grounds exist therefor, grant an injunction restraining any such defendant from-

(i) committing or continuing any such act or nuisance;

(ii) doing or committing any such act or nuisance;

(iii) removing or disposing of such property.

(2) For the purposes of this section, any defendant who shall have by his answer set up any

claim in reconvention and shall thereupon demand an affirmative judgment against the

plaintiff shall be deemed a plaintiff, and shall have the same right to an injunction as he

would have in an action brought by him against the plaintiff for the cause of action stated

in the claim in reconvention, and the plaintiff shall be deemed the defendant and the claim

in reconvention the plaint.

(3) Such injunctions may be granted at any time after the commencement of the action and

before final judgment after notice to the defendant, where the object of granting an

injunction will be defeated by delay, the court may enjoin the defendant until the hearing

and decision of the application for an injunction but for periods not exceeding fourteen

days at a time.

The above section shows that a court may grant an injunction for one or more of the purposes

set out in section 54 (1) under three limbs namely (a), (b), (c). While the aforesaid three limbs

[(a), (b), (c)] set out the purposes for which injunctions may be granted, limbs (i), (ii) and (iii)

appearing at the end of section 54 (1), set out what a Court can restrain by the issuance of an

injunction. It is not accidentally that the same wordings found in the aforesaid three limbs [(a),

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 10 of 16

(b), (c)] have been incorporated in verbatim, in limbs (i), (ii) and (iii) appearing at the end of that

section. This is why Justice Soza stated the following, in Felix Dias Bandaranayake case,7

It is necessary first of all to have a clear picture of the legal principles that are applicable

to the question before us. The jurisdictional provisions have already been noted. This is

an action instituted in the District Court and the application for an interim injunction was

made at the time the plaint was filed. So section 54(1) (a) and (i) of the Judicature Act

No. 2 of 1978 and sections 662 and 664 of the Civil Procedure Code apply. If it appears

from the plaint that the plaintiff demands and is entitled to a judgment against the

defendants, restraining the commission of an act or nuisance, which would produce injury

to him the Court may, on its appearing by the affidavit of the plaintiff or any other person

(and that would include the defendants as I have already pointed out) that sufficient

grounds exist therefor, grant an interim injunction restraining the defendants from

committing any such act or nuisance. The plaintiff must therefore have a clear legal right

which is being infringed or about to be infringed.

The law, namely section 662 of the Civil Procedure Code as well as section 54 of the Judicature

Act, make a clear distinction between an instance where an injunction has been prayed for in the

plaint itself, and an instance where an injunction is sought in a petition filed subsequent to filing

of the plaint. This is evident from the phrase Every application for an injunction for any of the

purposes mentioned in section 54 of the Judicature Act, except in cases where an injunction is

prayed for in a plaint in any action, shall be by petition in section 662 of the Civil Procedure

Code and the following phrase in section 54 of the Judicature Act;

(1) Where in any action instituted in a High Court, District Court or a Small Claims Court, it

appears-

(a) from the plaint that the plaintiff demands and is entitled to a judgment against

the defendant,. (Emphasis is mine)

Thus, section 54(1)(a) applies to an instance where an injunction has been prayed for in the

plaint itself. What an injunction issued in such a situation can restrain, is what has been stated in

(i) appearing at the end of that section.

As the injunction in the instant case, was sought at a later stage after filing the plaint, it would

be section 54(1)(b) and/or 54(1)(c) of the Judicature Act which would apply. This is also

7 Supra at page 301.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 11 of 16

confirmed by the fact that both those limbs have the phrase during the pendency of the action

which denotes that both the act or nuisance referred to in section 54(1)(b) and the removal or

disposal of the defendants property referred to in section 54(1)(c) are situations which must

have arisen during the pendency of the action.

The wording in limb 54(1)(c) namely threatens or is about to clearly indicates that section 54

(1)(c) caters to actions which the defendant intends taking in future. Further, section 54(1)(c)

refers to a situation where the defendant threatens or is about to remove or dispose of his

property with intent to defraud the plaintiff. While the Plaintiffs in the instant case have not

complained of anything of that sort happening, the requirement with intent to defraud the

plaintiff is also absent in this case. The Plaintiffs have sought an injunction to restrain the

Defendant from using the disputed roadway and that would not be an instance falling under

section 54(1)(c) of the Judicature Act. Therefore, that limb has no application to the instant case.

Thus, what needs to be considered is whether the Plaintiffs in the instant case have sought an

injunction for a purpose which falls under section 54(1)(b) of the Judicature Act.

In relation to the above, the relevant catch phrase in section 54(1)(b) would be an act or nuisance

in violation of the Plaintiffs rights in respect of the subject matter of the action and tending to

render the judgment ineffectual. As per this section, a plaintiff must satisfy two requirements;

firstly, an occurrence of an act or nuisance in violation of the Plaintiffs rights in respect of the

subject matter of the action; and secondly the occurrence of the said act or nuisance would tend

to render the judgment ineffectual.

Although section 54 of the Judicature Act has given a wide discretion to courts to issue injunctions

whenever it is just to do so, over the years our courts have developed three primary grounds or

parameters or guidelines to guide themselves when deciding the question whether it should

proceed to grant an interim injunction against a defendant. Those grounds could be summarized

in to a brief form to read as follows.

1) Has the applicant made out a strong prima facie case?

2) Whether the balance of convenience is in his favour?

3) Do equitable considerations favour the grant of an injunction?

Let me pause there for a moment and turn back again to the case of Felix Dias Bandaranayake

Vs. State Film Corporation and another.8 His Lordship Soza J in that case, has laid down the steps

8 Supra at page 302.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 12 of 16

the Court should follow in a chronological order. As the first step His Lordship has stated in that

case thus,

In Sri Lanka we start off with a prima facie case. That is, the applicant for an interim

injunction must show that there is a serious matter in relation to his legal rights, to be

tried at the hearing and that he has a good chance of winning. It is not necessary that

the plaintiff should be certain to win. It is sufficient if the probabilities are he will win.

Where however the plaintiff has established a strong prima facie case that he has title

to the legal right claimed by him but only an arguable case that the defendant has

infringed it or is about to infringe it, the injunction should not be granted (Hubbard v

Vosper).9

His Lordship Justice Soza in the same case states the 2nd step to be followed when deciding

whether to grant an interim injunction in the following manner.

If a prima facie case has been made out, we go on and consider where the balance

of convenience lies- Yakkaduwe Sri Pragnarama Thero v. The Minister of

Education.10 This is tested out by weighing the injury which the defendant will suffer

if the injunction is granted and he should ultimately turn out to be the victor against

the injury which the plaintiff will sustain if the injunction were refused and he should

ultimately turn out to be the victor. The main factor here is the extent of the

uncompensatable disadvantage or irreparable damage to either-party. As the object

of issuing an interim injunction is to preserve the property in dispute in statu quo the

injunction should not be refused if it will result in the plaintiff being cheated of his

lawful rights or practically decide the case in the defendant's favour and thus make

the plaintiff's eventual success in the suit if he achieves it a barren and worthless

victory.- see Bannerjee (ibid) pp. 578, 579. 11

His Lordship Justice Soza in the same case has laid down a 3rd step also when deciding on the

question of granting an interim injunction. It is in the following paragraph.

Lastly as the injunction is an equitable relief granted in the discretion of the Court, the

conduct and dealings of the parties (Ceylon Hotels Corporation v Jayatunga)12 and the

circumstances of the case are relevant. Has the applicant come into Court with clean

9 [1972] 1 All E. R. 1023, 1029. 10 (1969) 71 N L R 506, 511. 11 Supra at page 303. 12 (1969) 74 N L R 443, 446.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 13 of 16

hands? - see Duchess of Argyll v Duke of Argyll.13 Has his conduct been such as to

constitute acquiescence in the violation of infringement of his rights as the Court of

Appeal in England found in Monson v Tussauds Limited14 or waiver of his rights to the

injunction? 15

In the case of Seelawathie Mallawa Vs. Millie Keerthiratne,16 His Lordship Victor Perera J, too has

adopted a similar view when he stated as follows.

The principles which the Court must take into account when deciding whether to grant

an injunction or not have been formulated from time to time in decisions of our Courts

and have sometimes been re-formulated on the basis of decisions of the English Courts.

Generally the line of approach in exercising the Court's discretion whether to grant an

interim injunction or not has been, first to look at the whole case before it. The primary

consideration was the relative strength of the parties cases. The Court must have

regard not only to the nature and strength of the plaintiff's claim and demand but also

to the strength of the defence. It is when the Court has formed the opinion that the

plaintiff had a strong prima facie case, that the Court had then to decide what was best

to be done in the circumstances. ...... Initially the plaintiff therefore needs only to

satisfy the Court that there is a serious matter to be tried at the hearing.

In the case of D. S. Dissanayake Vs. Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation and others,17

His Lordship Justice H N G Fernando stated the same principle which can be seen in the following

paragraph.

The proper question for decision upon an application for an interim injunction is "

whether there is a serious matter to be tried at the hearing " (Jinadasa v.

Weerasinghe1[1 (1929) 31 N. L. R. 33.]). If it appears from the pleadings already filed

that such a matter does exist, the further question is whether the circumstances are

such that a decree which may ultimately be entered in favour of the party seeking the

injunction would be nugatory or ineffective if the injunction is not issued.

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 14 of 16

In a more recent case, M N Kariyawasam Vs. N W Sujatha Janaki and two others,18 Her Ladyship

Justice Chandra Ekanayake too has endorsed the same views. Thus, our Courts have consistently

adopted the above process in many cases.

Having stated as above, a brief account of the law pertaining to granting of injunctions, let me

now consider whether the refusal of the interim injunction by the learned District Judge in the

instant case, is justifiable.

Although the learned District Judge has given many reasons for the rejection of the interim

injunction in his painstakingly written order, for the purpose of disposing this case it would suffice

to observe the clear conclusion by the learned District Judge that the plaintiffs have failed to

establish a prima facie case. In that regard, as the learned District Judge has stated in his order,

the Plaintiffs are yet to obtain the title of the Lots No. 5 and 4 based on prescription. Hence the

burden of proving undisturbed, uninterrupted possession adverse to the title of the Plaintiffs, over

the said lots, under the laws governing prescription, is on the Plaintiffs. However, as pointed out

by the learned District Judge, the Plaintiffs have failed to address some of the important elements

of such proof. The Plaintiffs have failed to adduce any date or any time period during which they

have commenced the required adverse possession.

I also cannot find fault with the conclusion of the learned District Judge to accept and act on the

affidavits of the Grama Niladhari of the area, and the Postman who on a daily basis had used the

relevant road, to access the house of the Defendant to execute his official duties. In addition to

the above, the learned District Judge has given in his order, number of other reasons as well. I

do not find any reason to disagree with them. However, I would not venture into an exercise of

analyzing all those reasons as what I have mentioned above would be sufficient for me to agree

with the learned District Judge that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case which

is sufficient for the disposal of this appeal.

Thus, in my view, the evidence adduced in the inquiry by both parties do not point to or do not

justify a conclusion that the Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case. Therefore, the Plaintiffs

case for an interim injunction clearly does not pass the first threshold of necessity to establish a

prima facie case. Therefore, the consideration of the question of balance of convenience would

really not arise. However, for the sake of completeness I would albeit briefly, mention few

observations on that aspect as well.

As has been mentioned above, the Plaintiffs claim for the Lots 4 and 5 are purely based on

prescription. This is because the Defendants title and the Plaintiffs tittle both emanate from the

same source and therefore the Plaintiffs do not challenge the deed of the Defendant. Roadway

over Lots 4 and 5 is the roadway giving access the Defendants Lot from St. Josephs Street. It is

the same roadway which gives access to the 2nd Plaintiffs Lot according to the plan No. 1177.

Thus, the balance of convenience by preventing just one party, namely the Defendant, from using

the disputed roadway is definitely not in favour of the Plaintiffs. This is because both parties can

continue to use the disputed roadway until a final determination is made by Court. I cannot see

how a mere usage by one party, of a roadway which merely passes just two blocks of land

(outside their boundaries) could cause an irreparable damage to the other parties. There is also

no evidence to establish such a claim.

In any case, the usage by the Defendant, the disputed roadway, cannot be identified as an an

act or nuisance, the commission or continuance of which would produce injury to the Plaintiff

which warrants granting an interim injunction under section 54(1)(a) of the Judicature Act. The

said act cannot also be identified as an act or nuisance in violation of the Plaintiffs rights in

respect of the subject matter of the action and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, which

warrants granting an interim injunction under section 54(1)(b) of the Judicature Act.

As has been observed above, not granting the interim injunction against the Defendant would

not anyway prejudice the rights of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would also not suffer an irreparable

damage as a result of the Defendants use of the disputed roadway. The learned District Judge

has given extensive reasons for refusing to grant an interim injunction prayed for, by the Plaintiffs.

I cannot see any basis to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned District Judge.

The underlying principle of granting temporary relief is to maintain the status-quo until the final

determination of the suit. In those circumstances, I hold that the learned District Judges decision

to refuse to grant an interim injunction in the instant case is a well-founded one. For the

aforementioned reasons the plaintiffs are not entitled to the interim injunction sought.

I answer the questions of law as follows.

a. the learned District Judge has correctly evaluated the material when concluding that the

Plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case with a fair chance of winning the action

and that the balance of convenience has been tilted in favour of the Defendant. The

[SC Appeal 53/2021] Page 16 of 16

Provincial High Court has failed to correctly appreciate the reasons given by the learned

District Judge for refusing to grant the interim injunction.

b. The Provincial High Court had come to its conclusions without any evaluation, analysis or

examination of the reasons set out in the order of the learned District Judge. The Provincial

High Court also has failed to give any lawful reason for setting aside the order of the

learned District Judge.

c. The Provincial High Court has failed to appreciate that the Plaintiffs have not advanced

any case on any possible damage being caused to the roofs of the buildings of the

Plaintiffs. In any case there is no such danger by the mere user of the said access path

by the Defendant.

For the above reasons, I set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court dated 08-02-2019

and procced to restore and affirm the order dated 19-09-2014 pronounced by the learned District

Judge refusing to grant the interim injunction and dissolving the enjoining order. I allow this

appeal with costs payable by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant.
