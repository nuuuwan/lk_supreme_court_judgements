At this moment, it must be noted that the action was filed in the district court not to enforce a certificate under any given provision in law but on an alleged cause/s of action as averred in the plaint. It must also be noted that even though in paragraph 15 of the plaint, the plaintiff had averred that causes of action have accrued to the plaintiff, in the body of the plaint the plaintiff had not set forth separate causes of action as required by section 40(d) of the Civil Procedure Code but averred the cause/s of action as a composite whole through its averments. It appears, now, that the plaintiff had relinquished proving most of the averments in that composite whole and rely only on the production of the said certificate (P1) and purported decisions of the board connected to it (P4) along with the two deeds no.560 (P2) and no.563 (P3).",

Thus, the scheme of the act is to effect settlement of debts through applications made by the debtor or the creditor.

However, order contained in the certificate(P1) does not indicate that the board considered that there was a lease agreement (deed of lease marked as V4) executed between the plaintiff (transferee) and the defendant (transferor) in between the execution of P2 and P3 and that, if V4 is a legally valid document, the plaintiff\u2019s possession after P2 can be referable to said V4. On the other hand, whether deed no.560 is a conditional transfer or not has to be decided on the intention of the parties as at the time they entered into that contract. It is true, even if there was no condition to reconvey in the same document, the intention can be shown through a subsequent deed such as P3 but when there is deed of lease written prior to P3 giving the possession of the property back to the plaintiff, it appears parties to those P2 and P3 considered P2 as an outright transfer that gave the possession of the property to the defendant. To support this view there was another deed of lease executed between the parties even after the execution of P3, marked as V6. Thus, it appears the background to the transactions between the plaintiff and the defendant suggests a possibility that the possession of the plaintiff of the property, after P2 was executed, was not due to the fact that it was a conditional transfer but due to a lease agreement and that P3 was a separate agreement to resell the property. However, for some reason the board had considered the deed of transfer P2 as a conditional transfer and, that it also fell within the interpretation of \u201cmortgage\u201d as contemplated by section 64 of the Ordinance. Thus, the board had tried to effect a settlement but the defendant refused to accept the said settlement. In this regard, it is pertinent to examine the provisions of section 32(2) that existed prior to the amendment made by Act no.29 of 1999.",

On the other hand, it is not logical to allow the board to make a decision on the application when the law requires it to dismiss the application. The section only allowed the board to express its opinion if it thought that a fair offer was rejected by the creditor. As per the prescribed form, particulars of the debt furnished by the debtor could have been entered in the said form. Under the provision to include particulars of debt furnished by the debtor, the board has included its purported decision in the certificate by referring to the interest ordered and to the order contained in the overleaf. Such an act or step by the board is not supported by any provision in the Ordinance. Thus, what is found in the certificate marked P1, that is within the legal provisions relevant to the matter, appears to be the opinion expressed by the board that a fair suggestion to settle the loan was refused by the defendant and the details provided by the plaintiff with regard the purported debt. It cannot be perceived how a court of law can grant reliefs as prayed for in prayer (a) and (b), namely an order to reconvey the property and to evict the defendant, on a mere expression of an opinion of the board as to the refusal of the settlement or on the other contents in P1 which are not envisaged or permitted by the section 32(2) to include in such certificate.",

Even in this instant, no provision is made to bind parties on such decision in proceedings before court of law. Under section 47, the board is empowered to make orders or decision or settlements when a matter has been referred to it by a court.

Merely because the board considered a conditional transfer as a mortgage for such a purpose, a civil court of law is not bound to consider such deed as a mortgage when it becomes the subject matter in an action filed before it and the civil court has to decide the action on the facts proved before it. By tendering a certificate in terms of section 32(2), what can be proved is that the application before the board was dismissed and the board was of the view that the suggested settlement was fair and the plaintiff ought reasonably to have accepted it.

Thus, it could not contain a decision that can be enforced by a court merely by producing it. As explained above other orders or decisions contained in P1 certificate could not have been included in it as per section 32(2). Hence P1 certificate does not contain anything that can be enforced by mere production of it. Further the aforementioned section contemplates an action filed for the recovery of the property. As per section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code, every application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the exercise of court\u2019s power or authority or otherwise to invite its interference, constitute an action. It was stated in Lowe Vs Fernando 16 N L R 398 that generally \u201ccause of action\u201d is the wrong for the prevention or redress of which an action may be brought6. The wrong is the combination of the right and its violation. It is said that every action is based on a cause of action7. Thus, the action contemplated in section 39(2) (a) of the Ordinance also has to be based on a cause of action. In fact, the plaint in the action in the district court appears to have been drafted on purported causes of action- vide paragraph 15 of the plaint. Thus, to be successful in the action, the plaintiff had to prove her cause of action. By tendering or proving a certificate issued under section 32(2) of the ordinance which can lawfully contain a dismissal of an application tendered by the plaintiff to the board and an opinion of the board as to the reasonableness of the refusal of the defendant to accept a suggested settlement which in the opinion of the board was a fair settlement cannot prove a cause of action when it is considered with admissions made. To prove a cause of action, the plaintiff must prove a wrong done to her by the defendant. Mere opinion of the board along with the admissions mentioned above cannot prove such wrong. She should have proved that P2 is in fact a conditional transfer and she reasonably took steps to fulfill the conditions but the plaintiff failed to reconvey the property or at least that her proposed settlement was in fact a reasonable settlement but the plaintiff failed to accept it and reconvey the property. Mere proof of the opinion of the board cannot be considered as proof of such cause of action. She or person who had first-hand knowledge should have given evidence to prove such cause of action.",
