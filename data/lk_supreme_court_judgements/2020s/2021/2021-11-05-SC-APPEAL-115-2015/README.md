The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (later referred to as the

Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent-Respondent and hereinafter referred

to as the Plaintiff) instituted the instant action, under Section 2(1) of the

Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, before the District Court of Gampaha on

11.05.1994, primarily seeking to partition a commonly held land called

Batadenikele alias Baddehikele, which is in an extent of two Roods and 8.53

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

5

Perches and morefully described in the schedule to her plaint, according

to the pedigree set out therein. Having claimed a share entitlement of

the corpus on a deed of gift, the Plaintiff had also conceded to the

entitlement of the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the 1st Defendant), to the remaining share of the corpus.

Both the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant relied on two deeds of gift, in

proof of their respective entitlement. These two deeds of gift, Nos. 9854

of 18.09.92 and 7194 of 25.01.1993 were executed by the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent (later substituted by 2A Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent and hereinafter referred to as the 2nd

Defendant) and attested by Notary Public Pathiratne. The 3rd Defendant

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 3rd Defendant) was

added to the said partition action on 29.11.1995, as a disclosed party,

upon him making a claim before the surveyor as to the improvements

effected to the dwelling house, during the preliminary survey of the

corpus.

It is admitted by the parties that the 2nd Defendant is the original

owner of the corpus, who had received his title upon a final decree of

the partition case No. 18122/P, dated 12.05.1981. The 2nd Defendant had

gifted a share of the corpus to his 2nd wife, the Plaintiff and the

balance share to his eldest daughter, the 1st Defendant. The 3rd

Defendant, who was in possession of the house standing on the corpus,

is the only son of the 2nd Defendant.

In his statement of claim, the 3rd Defendant sought dismissal of

partition action or, in the alternative, sought compensation for bona fide

improvements made to the land as well as to the house, quantified at Rs.

950,000.00 and a declaration of Court to his entitlement to Jus Retentionis.

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

6

The District Court, having accepted that the 3rd Defendant is only

entitled to compensation for improvements made to his paternal house

by making additions to the existing building, further held that since he

failed to prove the stated amount of compensation and owing to their

very reason had desisted itself in awarding any compensation. The

Court also held that he is not entitled to Jus Retentionis as well. The trial

Court had thereupon decreed that the corpus be partitioned, with each

of the half share, allocated to Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the trial Court for its

failure to award any compensation, the 3rd Defendant preferred an

appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal, which had allowed his appeal

and awarded him Rs. 300,000.00 for bona fide improvements, instead of

Rs. 850,000.00 which he sought. He then preferred the instant appeal to

this Court, challenging the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal,

on the basis that it had awarded a lesser sum as compensation for the

bona fide improvements than the amount and thereupon seeking an

enhancement of the amount of compensation awarded to him by the

said appellate Court.

This Court, having afforded a hearing to the contesting parties on

30.06.2015, thought it fit to grant leave to the following questions of law,

that had been formulated by the 3rd Defendant in sub paragraphs I, II

and III of the paragraph 14 of his Petition, dated 28.04.2015.

I. Did the learned High Court err when deciding that in the

District Court a full trial was conducted, whereas on the 1st

date of evidence of the 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner,

a further date had been refused?

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

7

II. Did the learned High Court err in failing to assess the

evidence adduced by the parties, where all parties admitted

that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner was a bona fide

improver?

III. Did the learned High Court err in failing to assess the

evidence adduced by the parties, whereas the actual

amount of compensation should be at least Rs. 800,000/- for

the fully completed house?

Learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant, in her submissions before

this Court in support of the appeal, contended that since it was

absolutely essential for him to establish the value of the improvements

and developments he has carried out to the house, at the conclusion of

his evidence before the trial Court, made an application seeking an

adjournment to call another witness, in order to discharge that burden.

Calling of this witness was necessitated due to an objection raised by the

Plaintiff, that the documents relied on by the 3rd Defendant, are only to

be admitted in evidence subject to proof.

The said application for adjournment was refused by the trial

Court and the 3rd Defendant therefore contends before this Court that, in

view of the provisions of Section 25(1) and Section 76(1) to (3) of the

Partition Law, although a wide discretion was conferred on the trial

Court to allow such an application for an adjournment, it did not

exercise its discretion reasonably in this particular instance, resulting in

an adverse impact on his claim.

Learned Counsel for the 1st and 2A Defendants, in seeking to

counter the submissions of the 3rd Defendant that the final decree of the

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

8

partition action, on which the original owner (2nd Defendant) was

allocated a share, was pronounced only on 10.03.1981 and therefore, the

3rd Defendant cannot claim any compensation for improvements that

claims to have been effected prior to 1981. They further contend that,

although the 3rd Defendant claimed at least Rs. 800,000.00 for the fully

completed house in his petition seeking leave from this Court, his

amended statement of claim to the trial Court, he limited the amount

only to Rs. 350,000.00.

Thus, the issue of whether the trial Courts order of refusal to

grant the 3rd Defendant an adjournment, depriving him an opportunity

to call witness/witnesses on his behalf, was made erroneously, will have

to be considered at the outset, in view of the scope of the 1st question of

law.

In refusing the application of the 3rd Defendant for an

adjournment, the trial Court noted that the instant action being a

partition action, its trial had taken over 8 years to reach that stage of the

proceedings. It also noted that the 3rd Defendant, in presenting his case,

had failed to take any steps at all to call his witnesses, and not even

made an attempt at least by moving for summons on them, in spite of

having had the full knowledge of the requirement to prove the

documents that he himself had tendered to Court during his evidence,

as they were marked subject to proof.

The legal question presented before this Court therefore revolves

around the question whether the refusal to grant an adjournment is an

erroneously made order or not. In support of his contention that it is an

order erroneously made, the 3rd Defendant relied on the provisions

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

9

contained in Section 76 of the Partition Law, which deals with

adjournments.

Provisions of subsection 76(3) deals with trials as it states that the

Court may, for sufficient cause, either on the application of the parties or of its

own motion, advance or postpone the trial to any other day, upon such terms as

to costs or otherwise as to it shall seem proper. Once a partition action had

been fixed for trial, there must be a sufficient cause for the trial Court,

for it to make an order to advance or to postpone an already fixed trial

date.

The proceedings relating to the application of the 3rd Respondent,

in seeking an adjournment for further trial, indicate that he made an

application seeking permission of the trial Court to call the witnesses,

who have already been listed by him, in relation to the documents

marked V13, V14 and V15. He had thus made an application for

adjournment to Court.

Perusal of the appeal brief reveals that the instant partition action

had been instituted on 11.05.1994 and the trial Commenced on

28.02.2001 with the acceptance of the points of contest, by the trial Court.

The Plaintiff had closed her case on 01.06.2007 and the Defendants case

commenced on 01.08.2007 with the 1st Defendant giving evidence. She

called a witness on her behalf. That witness concluded his evidence on

08.12.2008. The trial adjourned to 11.05.2009 for further trial of

Defendants case and the 3rd Defendant had commenced his evidence.

He was cross examined and re-examined on the same day and then only

the application for adjournment was made. With the refusal of the

application for an adjournment, the 3rd Defendant had decided to close

his case with the available evidence. At that stage, the Plaintiff again

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

10

moved trial Court to reject the documents, relied on and marked by the

3rd Defendant as V1, V2, V13, V14, V15 and V16, on the basis they were

not proved.

The documents V1, V2, V13, V14, V15 and V16, included the two

documents issued by the relevant bank branches, indicating that the 3rd

Defendant had obtained loans to carry out repair work on a dwelling

house. The remaining documents concern purchases of hardware items.

It is also evident that the 3rd Defendant had, despite the objection,

tendered these documents along with his written submissions and the

trial Court too had considered the contents of those documents, in

holding that he did in fact carry out renovation work to his fathers

house. Thus, his interests were not prejudiced at all, merely because the

trial Court had not allowed an adjournment to call a witness.

In the list of witnesses filed by the 3rd Defendant he had cited 14

witnesses including himself. The 1st Defendant, who presented her

evidence before Court had cited only four witnesses and called only one

of them. When the trial was adjourned to 11.05.2009, the 1st Defendant

and her witness had already concluded their evidence and it was for the

3rd Defendant to place his evidence on that day. When the 3rd Defendant

sought to mark documents through the witness for the 1st Defendant, it

was objected to and marked subject to proof. On 11.05.2009, the 3rd

Defendant gave evidence and concluded his evidence. Clearly, he had

not taken any steps to secure attendance of any of his witnesses on that

date, although he knew very well that it was for him to prove the

documents, that were marked subject to proof, by calling relevant

witnesses on that day, to which step he had more than sufficient time to

take.

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

11

The trial Court, after rejecting the 3rd Defendants application to

permit to call witnesses, had decided to proceed with the case. The 3rd

Defendant thereafter closed his case on that day.

The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal clearly indicates

the several grounds of appeal that had been urged before it by the 3rd

Defendant at the hearing of his appeal. The ground of appeal under F,

contained in the impugned judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal,

had been raised only on the premise that the trial Court had erred, in its

failure to award compensation for bona fide improvements to the house.

The appellate Court had referred to the submissions of the 3rd

Defendant, in which he submitted that if afforded an opportunity he

could have proved these documents. None of these factors indicate that

the 3rd Defendant ever did challenge the said refusal of an adjournment.

In these circumstances, I am not convinced that the order of the

trial Court had been made erroneously since there was no sufficient

cause for it to exercise its discretion conferred on it by section 76(3) of

the Partition Law, in favour of the 3rd Defendant in granting the

adjournment. No interlocutory appeal was taken by the 3rd Defendant

against the said refusal to grant an adjournment and strangely, in

prosecuting the final appeal preferred against the judgement of the trial

Court to the High Court of Civil Appeal, the 3rd Defendant had failed to

raise a ground of appeal on this particular order.

I propose to deal with the remaining questions of law formulated

by learned Counsel in relation to the award made by the High Court of

Civil Appeal on the entitlement of the 3rd Defendant on the question of

compensation for bona fide improvements at this stage.

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

12

The question of law whether the High Court of Civil Appeal err

in failing to assess the evidence adduced by the parties where all parties

admitted that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner was a bona fide

improver, had been formulated, apparently on the presumption of fact

that the status of the 3rd Defendant as a bona fide improver had not been

disputed by the parties and therefore admitted by the parties. The

question then proceeds to the remaining segment where it raises the

issue whether the appellate Court had fallen into error in assessing the

evidence led by the parties on his entitlement, when he in fact a bona fide

improver.

There is no such admission that was marked before the trial Court

at the commencement of the trial nor was there any admission by the

Plaintiff or by the 1st Defendant that the 3rd Defendant is a bona fide

improver. On the contrary none of the opposing parties even accept that

he made any improvement to the house built by their father, the 2nd

Defendant. When they were cross examined by the 3rd Defendant, it was

suggested to them that he did carry out renovations to the house. But

the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and her witness have strenuously denied

any contribution by the 3rd Defendant in that respect. The parties,

although disputed as to who made the improvements, only agree that

there were certain renovations carried out to their fathers house, in and

around 1984.

During the trial, the 3rd Defendant conceded to the share

entitlement of both the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant and proceeded

only with his claim for compensation. It was his evidence that he was

promised ownership of the family house by his late father, the 2nd

Defendant and therefore in that belief he had made improvements to it

periodically by renovating the old paternal house and by planting many

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

13

trees by spending Rs. 850,000.00, commencing from about 1974. He

described the extent of the improvements he had effected by stating that

he made the existing wattle and daub house, belonged to his father, a

brick walled one with walls plastered in cement. He also had added on

a verandah, a kitchen and a toilet. He had relied on documentary proof

in support of loans obtained to carry out these improvements and

receipts issued by a hardware store.

The trial Court had correctly arrived at the conclusion in favour of

the 3rd Defendant that he had in fact made certain improvements to his

fathers house and therefore is entitled to compensation on that account.

This conclusion was reached on the basis that the house D as shown in

the preliminary plan X had been altered by adding new constructions

to it and the trial Court noted that the 3rd Defendants entitlement to

compensation limits to those new additions. In appeal, the High Court

of Civil Appeal too has held in favour of the 3rd Defendant by holding

that the evidence clearly points to the fact that it was he who made the

new constructions. However, the High Court of Civil Appeal, in

determining the quantum of compensation that should be awarded to

the 3rd Defendant, stated that the evidence does not support his claim

that Rs. 850,000.00 was spent on those additions to the house and

therefore limited its award to Rs. 300,000.00.

The High Court of Civil Appeal, in determining the amount to be

awarded as compensation for improvements to the 3rd Defendant,

considered the contents of the documents marked V15 and V16, that had

been issued by the respective banks, in confirmation of the loans taken

by him in relation to construction work on home improvement. The

appellate Court, having accepted the two documents on the footing

there was no challenge mounted by opposing parties as to its

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

14

genuineness, had considered them in favour of the 3rd Defendant.

Thereafter, the Court had proceeded to award Rs. 300,000.00 as

compensation to the 3rd Defendant, based on the evidence and

circumstances that were available before it, despite of his demand of Rs.

850,000.00. The answer given by the trial Court to issue No. 10 was

accordingly amended by the High Court of Civil Appeal to reflect its

reasoning in favour of the 3rd Defendant and conclusion it had reached

on the point.

It was submitted by the learned Counsel at the hearing that the

main point of argument is the quantum of compensation awarded by

the High Court of Civil Appeal, to which he seeks enhancement.

In a partition action, a party claiming compensation for bona fide

improvements, the applicable principle of law has stated by Pereira J, in

Perera v Pelmadulla Rubber & Tea Company et al (1913) 16 NLR 306 as

follows:

In the case of a bona fide possessor, what he is entitled to

receive as the value of improvements effected by him is the

amount by which the value of the whole property on

which the improvements have been effected has been

enhanced by reason of the improvements, or the actual

expenditure incurred in effecting the improvements,

whichever is less.

When the surveyor visited the corpus, in making the preliminary

plan, the 3rd Defendant claimed that he had lived in the house since his

birth and made improvement to it commencing from 1970 until 1991

with his own funding but did not quantify it. The assertion of the 3rd

Defendant that he made improvements since 1970 was effectively

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

15

refuted by his opponents when he admitted the fact that he was

employed only in 1975. This resultant situation leaves with weak

evidence as to the value of the improvements that are attributed to the

3rd Defendant who thereby left the Courts with insufficient evidence to

decide on the quantum of his claim.

The documents that the 3rd Defendant referred to in his

submissions as the items of evidence he was deprived of an

opportunity to prove (V1, V2, V13, V14, V15 and V 16) would only add

up to Rs.43,019.15, which the High Court of Civil Appeal in fact did

consider in his favour in determining the amount at Rs. 300,000.00. As

the learned Counsel for the 1st Defendant contends, these were the only

documents that the 3rd Defendant relied on to prove his claim of

compensation, in order to establish the varying amounts, which he cited

from time to time. In the amended statement of claim the compensation

was quantified by the 3rd Defendant at Rs. 850,000.00 but did not put

that position to the Plaintiff. During cross examination of the 1st

Defendant, it was suggested to her that he spent Rs. 500,000.00 to

construct the new house, which she denied. He then suggested he

made improvements to the value of 350,000.00 to that house. That

suggestion too was denied by the 1st Defendant. In cross examining the

witness called by the 1st Plaintiff, it was suggested that he had spent Rs.

350,000.00 to add a room, a storeroom and a kitchen to the house.

Strangely, the 3rd Defendant did not mention any specific amount as

compensation for improvements and offered an explanation to his

inability to produce any documentary proof of expenditure on the

improvements and renovations that were made to the house on the basis

that he had accepted his fathers oral promise that he would have the

ownership of the house and, having acted on that verbal assurance, he

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

16

did not keep a record of the expenditure made on improvements. In

advancing yet another position before this Court, the 3rd Defendant

relied on the third question of law based on his perceived entitlement to

Rs. 800,000.00 as compensation for the fully completed house.

I have carefully considered the quantum of compensation

awarded by the High Court of Civil Appeal, in the light of the available

evidence that had been placed before the trial Court by the parties to the

instant partition action, and find that there is no error on the part of the

appellate Court made either on evidence or on the law, in determining

the quantum of entitlement.

The District Court as well as the High Court of Civil Appeal had

considered the available evidence on the entitlement of compensation

for bona fide improvements to the 3rd Defendant. The High Court of Civil

Appeal had corrected the judgment of the original Court, when it had

quantified the entitlement of the 3rd Defendant to compensation for

improvements at Rs. 300,000.00. It is clear from the evidence that the 3rd

Defendant had opted for the mode in which he is expected to prove the

actual expenditure incurred effecting the improvements rather than proving

the amount by which the value of the whole property on which the

improvements have been effected has been enhanced by reason of the

improvements. The 3rd Defendant had however failed to establish his

proclaimed entitlement to compensation of Rs. 800,000.00, since the

actual expenditure incurred effecting the improvements only points to the

sum awarded by the High Court of Civil Appeal and therefore his

entitlement is limited to Rs. 300,000.00.

In view of the forgoing, I proceed to answer all three questions of

law against the 3rd Defendant and in the negative. Since all questions

S.C. Appeal No. 115/2015

17

were answered in the negative, I accordingly affirm the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal and dismiss the appeal of the 3rd Defendant

with costs.
