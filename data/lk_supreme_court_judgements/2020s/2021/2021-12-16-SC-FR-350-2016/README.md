Rajiv Goonetilleke, SSC for the Hon. Attorney General.

Argued on: 22-03-2021.

Decided on: 16-12-2021

P Padman Surasena J

Petitioners are police officers and retired police officers claiming to have been

politically victimized during the period 1994 to 31-07-2014.

In 2015, the then Cabinet of Ministers, having considered the Memorandum dated 09-

03-20151 under the title “To provide relief to those who were victimized for political

reasons” submitted by the then Prime Minister, decided on 08-04-2015, to issue a

Public Administration Circular to provide a reasonable period of time for those officers,

if any, who have been subjected to political victimization and who wish to seek relief,

but not yet submitted their appeals, to submit their appeals. The Cabinet of Ministers

also decided to authorize the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration to appoint an

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 5 of 28

official committee comprising of three retired public officers who had served in the

capacity of Additional Secretary or any other similar or higher post to examine the said

appeals and make recommendations. The Petitioners have produced the said cabinet

decision made on 08-04-2015, marked P 4.

As authorized by the said cabinet decision, the Secretary Ministry of Public

Administration had issued the Public Administration circular No. 09/2015 dated 17-04-

2015, calling for appeals to be submitted to the Ministry of Public Administration by

05-05-2015. The Petitioners have produced the said Public Administration circular No.

09/2015 marked P 5.

The Petitioners have stated in their petition2 that the Minister of Public Order and

Christian Affairs thereafter sought approval for the implementation of the

recommendations of the Committee referred to in the said Public Administration

circular No. 09/2015 (P 5), from the Cabinet of Ministers, by the Cabinet Memorandum

dated 17th June 2015. The Petitioners have produced the said Cabinet Memorandum

dated 17th June 2015 marked P 6. The 9th Respondent (Secretary, National Police

Commission) has also produced the same marked 9 R1.

The Cabinet of Ministers had thereafter decided inter alia on 17th June 2015, to obtain

the observations of the 19th Respondent (Hon. Attorney General) on the

implementation of the recommendations of the above Committee. The 9th Respondent

has produced the said decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers on 17th June 2015

marked 9 R2.

The Petitioners have also stated in their petition that the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers was conveyed by P 7 by the 14th Respondent (Secretary to the Cabinet of

Ministers) to the Secretary Ministry of Law and Order. The Petitioners have produced

the said decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers on 21st October 2015 marked P 7.

The 9th Respondent has produced the said decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers

on 21st October 2015 marked 9 R4.

The Petitioners have stated that subsequently another committee (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the “Basnayake Committee”) comprising of Ms. B. M. M.

2 Paragraph 3 (c) of the petition dated 04-10-2016.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 6 of 28

Basnayake (11th Respondent), Neil Hapuhinna (12th Respondent) and Ravi

Wijegunawardene (13th Respondent) was appointed to reconsider and make

recommendations as there were anomalies in the recommendations made by two

previous committees. This Committee (Basnayake Committee) recommended granting

relief to 129 police officers. The Petitioners have produced the Basnayake Committee

report marked P 8 A.

The Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development thereafter sought approval

for the implementation of the recommendations of the Basnayake Committee from

the Cabinet of Ministers, by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 10th June 2016. The

Petitioners have produced the said Cabinet Memorandum dated 10th June 2016

marked P 8. The 9th Respondent has produced the said Cabinet Memorandum dated

10th June 2016 marked 9 R7.

The Cabinet of Ministers having considered the Note to the Cabinet dated 26-07-2016

(9 R8) forwarded by the Prime Minster, Cabinet Decision dated 19th April 2016, the

observations of the President (9 R9) and the observations of the Minister of Finance

(9 R10), had decided on 9th August 2016 to direct the Secretary Ministry of Law and

Order and Southern Development to implement the proposals recommended. The

Cabinet of Ministers also decided to treat the above Decision as a matter of Policy.

The Petitioners have produced the copy of the said Cabinet Decision dated 9th August

2016 marked (P 9). The 9th Respondent has also produced the copy of the said Cabinet

Decision dated 9th August 2016 marked (9R 11). For clarity I would reproduce below

the said Cabinet decision P 9 (9R 11).

08. Cabinet Paper No. 16/1473/702/053, a Note to the Cabinet dated 2016-07-26 by

the Prime Minister on “Providing relief to those who faced difficulties due to

political reasons”- (Cabinet decisions dated 2016-04-19 on CP No. 16/0654/748/010

and 2016-06-28 on CP No. 16/1134/748/010-I refers) the above Note was considered

along with the observations of H.E the President and the Minister of Finance. After

discussion, it was decided-

a) to grant approval treating this as matter of policy, to the proposals (I) and (II)

in paragraph 03 of the Note;

b) to direct the Secretary, Ministry of Law & Order and Southern Development-

(i) to take note of the matters highlighted in the observations of H.E the

President and pursue action accordingly, and

(ii) to obtain the concurrence/approval of the relevant authorities prior to

implementation of the proposals referred to at (a) above, as indicated in

the observations of the Minister of Finance.

It was also decided to treat this decision as confirmed and to authorize the Secretary

to the Cabinet of Ministers to convey the same to the relevant authorities for necessary

action accordingly.

Action by: Secretary to the Prime Minister - above observations annexed.

My/Finance - observations of H.E the President annexed.

Secretary, National Police Commission - copy of Note and above

observations annexed.

The Petitioners state that thereafter, replying to a letter by the National Police

Commission (1st Respondent), the Inspector General of Police (10th Respondent)

submitted his report by his letter bearing reference DP/OW/813/2016 dated

15/09/2016, to the National Police Commission giving clearance for 17 officers

mentioned in the Basnayake Committee report (P 8 A). The Petitioners have

produced the copy of the said letter marked P 10 and the report of the Inspector

General of Police marked P 10 A.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 8 of 28

The Petitioners state that thereafter, S A D M P Gunasekara, the 17th Respondent,

who was the OIC Division, Nugegoda was promoted with effect from 10-06-2016,3

from the rank of Senior Superintendent of Police to the rank of Deputy Inspector

General of Police on the approval of National Police Commission on the grounds of

political victimization discriminating others who were in similar circumstances. The

Petitioners allege that the promotion of the 17th Respondent is violative; as his name

is not in the list cleared by the Inspector General of Police P 10 and P 10 A; there

were others having similar qualifications left out. It is in that backdrop that the

Petitioners in this application have prayed inter alia, for the following relief in their

petition.

i. Declare that the Petitioners’ fundamental rights enshrined in Article 12 (1),

have been violated and/or are subject to continuing infringement by the

Respondents and State;

ii. Declare that the 1st, 3rd and 5th Petitioners are eligible to be promoted to

the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police with effect from 10-06-2016,

in view of P 8, P 8A, P 9 and P1 0;

iii. Declare that the 2nd Petitioner is eligible to be promoted to the rank of

Superintendent of Police with effect from 01-01-2016 in view of P 8, P 8A

P 9, P 1, P 2, and P 10;

iv. Declare that the 4th Petitioner is eligible to be promoted to the rank of

Superintendent of Police with effect from 01-01-2016 in view of P 8, P 8A,

P 9 and P10;

v. Issue direction to 1st to 8th and 10th Respondents to appoint the Petitioners

according to above declarations;

vi. Issue directions to 10th Respondent Inspector General of Police to provide

all privileges entitled to their ranks, to the Petitioners, once they are

promoted;

vii. Grant each petitioner a compensation of Rs. 1 million.

In the instant case, the Court has granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Thus, the task of this Court must be to ascertain whether anyone or

3 Telephone message produced marked P 11.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 9 of 28

more of the Respondents have infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In that regard I would examine

whether the promotion of the 17th Respondent has been made discriminating the

Petitioners thereby infringing their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution.

At the outset, one must bear in mind that according to the case advanced by the

Petitioners, the promotions of the Petitioners or the 17th Respondent or any other

officer in the given instance is possible only under the terms of the relevant Cabinet

decision. As can be clearly seen from the said Cabinet decision dated 09th August

2016 (P 9), the implementation of the proposals recommended in the Note to the

Cabinet forwarded by the Prime Minister has been approved subject to the following

conditions (reproduced in verbatim):

(i) to take note of the matters highlighted in the observations of H.E the President

and pursue action accordingly, and

(ii) to obtain the concurrence/approval of the relevant authorities prior to

implementation of the proposals referred to at (a) above, as indicated in the

observations of the Minister of Finance.

Thus, the implementation of the relevant Cabinet decision must necessarily be done

subject to the aforesaid conditions. The 9th Respondent has produced the observations

of the President referred to in the relevant Cabinet decision marked 9 R 9 which

clearly shows that the said Cabinet decision must be implemented in such a way that

the implementing of the relief recommended by the committee should not affect the

seniority of other serving police officers.

The Affidavit of the 9th Respondent, Nawalage Ariyadasa Cooray - Secretary, National

Police Commission sheds light as to why the Petitioners could not be promoted in

terms of the relevant Cabinet decision. He has explained that the relief recommended

to the Petitioners could not be implemented due to the following reasons and the said

reasons are set out in the observations received from the 10th Respondent. Indeed, it

is the Petitioners themselves who have produced the relevant observations of the

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 10 of 28

Inspector General of Police marked P 10 and P 10 A. The said reasons are as follows

(reproduced in verbatim):

• 1st Petitioner – The seniority of 93 other police officers of similar rank to him

(SSP) will be adversely affected if his promotion is backdated to 10.06.2011.

• 2nd Petitioner – Although there is a recommendation to promote him to the rank

of DIG with effect from 01.01.2016, there is no recommendation on his

promotion within the ranks of IP to SSP.

• 3rd Petitioner – The seniority of other police officers of similar rank (SSP), but

more senior to him, will be adversely affected if his promotion is backdated to

10.06.2011.

• 4th Petitioner – The seniority of police officers of similar rank (SSP), but more

senior to him, will be adversely affected if his promotion is backdated to

10.06.2011.

• 5th Petitioner – The seniority of 1124 other police officers of similar rank to him

(SSP) will be adversely affected if his promotion is backdated to 10.06.2011.

Let me now examine whether the 17th Respondent could have been promoted in terms

of the relevant Cabinet decision. The 9th Respondent, (Secretary, National Police

Commission) has also explained as to how the promotion of the 17th Respondent was

possible in terms of the said Cabinet Decision.

The 17th Respondent is one of those 129 police officers whose names were submitted

to the Cabinet, by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 10.06.2016. His name appears as

No. 08 in the schedule (P 8A). He was to retire on 19.09.2016. Thus, his promotion

on the grounds of political victimization could not have materially affected the seniority

of any other serving police officer holding a similar rank held by the 17th Respondent

at the time (SSP) or an officer holding a rank similar to which the 17th Respondent

was promoted (DIG). The 9th Respondent has produced a copy of the letter dated

19.08.2016 sent to him by the 10th Respondent marked 9 R13. This letter has

indicated the 17th Respondent’s date of retirement and the fact that the backdating of

his promotion would not affect the seniority of the other serving police officers.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 11 of 28

Therefore, the implementation of the relief recommended in respect of the 17th

Respondent did not adversely affect the seniority of any other serving officer holding

similar rank and therefore, was in compliance with the Cabinet Decision (P 9).

Thus, the Petitioners have been unable to prove that the Respondents have infringed

the fundamental rights of any of the Petitioners by promoting the 17th Respondent,

from the rank of Senior Superintendent of Police to the rank of Deputy Inspector

General of Police with effect from 10-06-2016.4

Despite the above conclusion, looking at this case from somewhat different

perspective, I am prompted to add the following comments also in relation to the

promotions of public officers in this country. This is because the Police officers were

also basically public officers coming under the purview of the Public Service

Commission until the 17th Amendment to the Constitution established the National

Police Commission and vested the powers of carrying out functions relating to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers

other than the Inspector-General of Police, in that Commission. Later, the 20th

Amendment to the Constitution repealed Article 155 G which entrusted the aforesaid

powers to the National Police Commission bringing back the Police officers again under

the purview of the Public Service Commission.

The Public Service Commission was initially established in Sri Lanka by Article 58 of

the then existing Constitution of Ceylon. [Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council 1946

(Chapter 379)]. That Constitution was promulgated as a result of the endeavors of the

Soulbury Commission appointed in the years 1944 and 1945 by His Majesty’s

Government under the chairmanship of the Right Honourable Herwald, Baron

Soulbury, O.B.E., M.C., to visit the then Island of Ceylon in order to examine and

discuss proposals for constitutional reforms. Thus, it became commonly known as the

Soulbury Constitutuion. The country known as Ceylon then, was a member of the

British Commonwealth of Nations which had an autonomous state within the British

Empire. Having a common allegiance to the British Crown then was a prominent

feature in that Constitution and was compatible with then Dominion Status of Ceylon.

4 Telephone message produced marked P 11.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 12 of 28

Thus, Article 57 of the Soulbury Constitution had expressly provided for the tenure of

office of state officers in the following manner.

57. Save as otherwise provided in this order, every person holding office

under the Crown in respect of the Government of the Island shall hold office

during Her Majesty’s pleasure.

However, Article 58(1) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council 1946, established

a Public Service Commission and the said Article read as follows;

58. (1) There shall be a Public Service Commission which shall consist of three

persons, appointed by the Governor-General, one at least of whom shall be a

person who has not, at any time during the period of five years immediately

preceding, held any public office or judicial office. The Governor-General shall

nominate one of the members of the Commission to be the Chairman. …..

Article 60 of that Constitution vested the powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal

and disciplinary control of public officers in the Public Service Commission. Provisions

such as disqualifying the Senators or the Members of Parliament from becoming

members of the Public Service Commission,5 restraining the members of the Public

Service Commission from holding any paid office as a servant of the Crown and making

them ineligible for subsequent appointment as Public Officers,6 entitlement of

members of the Public Service Commission to hold office for a period of five years

from the date of their appointment,7 the mandatory requirement for the Governor-

General to assign a cause when removing any member of the Public Service

Commission from his office,8 the requirement to determine the salary payable to the

members of the Public Service Commission by Parliament and the inability to reduce

their salaries during their terms of office,9 were salient features of the Public Service

Commission under the Soulbury Constitution. Those provisions aimed at maintaining

the independence of the Public Service Commission. Thus, right from the inception,

5 Article 58 (2) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946. 6 Article 58 (3) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946. 7 Article 58 (4) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946. 8 Article 58 (5) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946. 9 Article 58 (7) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 13 of 28

the Public Service Commission was an institution meant to be an independent body

charged with the powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control

of public officers.

However, the first Republican Constitution (1972) did away with the Public Service

Commission and vested the powers of the appointment, transfer, dismissal and

disciplinary control of state officers in the Cabinet of Ministers.

Article 106 of the 1972 Constitution read as follows;

106. (1) The Cabinet of Ministers shall be responsible for the appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of state officers and shall be

answerable therefor to the National State Assembly.

(2) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall

have the power of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of

all state officers.

(3) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall

provide for and determine all matters relating to state officers including the

constitution of state services, the formulation of schemes of recruitment and

codes of conduct for state officers, the procedure for the exercise and the

delegation of the powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary

control of state officers.

(4) The Cabinet of Ministers may notwithstanding any delegation of powers

as is referred to in this Chapter exercise its powers of appointment, transfer,

dismissal and disciplinary control of state officers.

(5) No institution administering justice shall have the power or jurisdiction to

inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any

recommendation, order or decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, a Minister, the

State Services Advisory Board, the State Services Disciplinary Board, or a state

officer, regarding any matter concerning appointments, transfers, dismissals

or disciplinary matters of state officers.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 14 of 28

Article 107(1) of the 1972 Constitution expressly provided for the tenure of office of

state officers and related powers vested in the National State Assembly in that regard

in the following manner;

107. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided by the Constitution, every

state officer shall hold office during the pleasure of the President. The

National State Assembly may however in respect of a state officer holding

office during the pleasure of the President provide otherwise by a law passed

by a majority of those present and voting.

Thereafter, the second Republican Constitution (1978) continued to vest the powers

of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers in the

Cabinet of Ministers. However, there was provision for the Cabinet of Ministers to

delegate from time to time, its powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal and

disciplinary control of public officers other than Heads of Departments, to the Public

Service Commission. Thus, the 1978 Constitution at its inception, re-established the

Public Service Commission as a body exercising authority delegated to it by the Cabinet

of Ministers.

Article 55 of the 1978 Constitution in its original form was as follows;

“55 (1) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers is hereby vested

in the Cabinet of Ministers, and all public officers shall hold office at

pleasure.

(2) The Cabinet of Ministers shall not delegate its powers of appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control in respect of Heads of

Departments.

(3) The Cabinet of Ministers may from time to time, delegate its powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of other public

officers to the Public Service Commission.

Provided that …….”

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 15 of 28

Although the original Article 55 of 1978 Constitution chose to continue with the

principle that all public officers shall hold office at pleasure,10 it however made the

decisions made by those exercised power under Article 55 amenable to the

fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court11 removing hitherto existed bar

for any court or institution administering justice to inquire into, pronounce upon or in

any manner call in question any such decision. This was a yet another step taken to

ensure the correctness of such decisions.

Thereafter, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution which was certified on 03rd

October 2001, brought about fundamental changes to the afore-stated original

position in the 1978 Constitution. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution repealed

the whole of original Chapter IX and substituted it with a new Chapter IX. The changes

included the structure of the powers vested in the Cabinet of Ministers in relation to

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers. Most

importantly, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution transferred the powers of

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers

other than the Heads of Department back to the Public Service Commission and

abolished the principle that ‘all public officers shall hold office at pleasure’ which

continued to be in the Constitutions of this country from the time of British Colonization

period up until the implementation of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The

Cabinet of Ministers continued to retain the power in relation to appointment, transfer,

dismissal and disciplinary control of the Heads of Departments and also retained the

power to provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers. The

relevant Articles 55 (1), 55(3) and 55(4) introduced by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution read as follows,

55 (1) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal

of public officers shall be vested in the Commission.

55 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all Heads

10 As Article 55(1) of 1978 Constitution stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. 11 As Article 55(5) of 1978 Constitution stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 16 of 28

of Departments shall vest in the Cabinet of Ministers, who shall exercise such

powers after ascertaining the views of the Commission.

55 (4) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers

shall provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers.

Article 55 (5) introduced by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution states that the

Public Service Commission will carry out its affairs according to the policies laid down

by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Public Service Commission is answerable to the

parliament in regard to carrying out its functions.

Article 59 brought in by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution also introduced a

procedure to enable any aggrieved party to challenge the decisions made by the Public

Service Commission by way of preferring an appeal to the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal appointed by the Judicial Service Commission which was given an appellate

power to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision made by the Public Service

Commission.

The 17th Amendment to the Constitution continued to preserve the fundamental rights

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over the decisions made by the relevant bodies in

the following manner;

Article 61A.

Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article 126,

no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or

pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made

by the Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of any

power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to a

Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.

Another important change that was introduced by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution is the insertion of a new Chapter XVIIIA immediately after Article 155 of

the Constitution establishing the National Police Commission by Article 155A thereof

and vesting it with powers in relation to the appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of

Police. Article 155G which vested those powers in the National Police Commission was

as follows,

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 17 of 28

155G. (1) (a) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and

dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police, shall

be vested in the Commission. The Commission shall exercise its powers of

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal in consultation with the

Inspector-General of Police.

(b) The Commission shall not in the exercise of its powers under this Article,

derogate from the powers and functions assigned to the Provincial Police

Service Commissions as and when such Commissions are established under

Chapter XVIIA of the Constitution.

(2) The Commission shall establish procedures to entertain and investigate

public complaints and complaints of any aggrieved person made against a

police officer or the police service, and provide redress in accordance with the

provisions of any law enacted by Parliament for such purpose.

(3) The Commission shall provide for and determine all matters regarding

police officers, including the formulation of schemes of recruitment and

training and the improvement of the efficiency and independence of the police

service, the nature and type of the arms, ammunition and other equipment

necessary for the use of the National Division and the Provincial Divisions,

codes of conduct, and the standards to be followed in making promotions and

transfers, as the Commission may from time to time consider necessary or fit.

(4) The Commission shall exercise all such powers and perform all such

functions and duties as are vested in it under Appendix I of List I contained

in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.

However, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which was certified on 09th

September 2010, repealed Article 155G; it also repealed hitherto existed Article 55

and replaced it with new Article 55 which is as follows;

55. (1) The Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters

of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating to appointments,

promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal.

(2) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal

of all Heads of Department shall, vest in the Cabinet of Ministers.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 18 of 28

(3) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment,

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall

be vested in the Public Service Commission.

(4) The Commission shall not derogate from the powers and functions of the

Provincial Public Service Commissions as are established by law.

(5) The Commission shall be responsible and answerable to Parliament in

accordance with the provisions of the Standing Orders of Parliament for the

exercise and discharge of its powers and functions. The Commission shall

also forward to Parliament in each calendar year, a report of its activities in

respect of such year.

That resulted in re-transferring the National Police Commission’s powers in relation to

the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police

officers back to the Public Service Commission. This brought the police officers back

under the category of public officers coming under the purview of the Public Service

Commission. All matters pertaining to the appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers pending before the National Police

Commission stood transferred to the Public Service Commission by virtue of section

36(5) of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

This also brought the power to provide for and determine all matters of policy relating

to police officers back under the Cabinet of Ministers by virtue of Article 55 (1)

introduced by the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

In the instant case, it was in the year 2015 that the then Cabinet of Ministers having

considered the Memorandum dated 09-03-201512 under the title “To provide relief to

those who were victimized for political reasons” submitted by the then Prime Minister,

had decided on 08-04-2015, to issue a Public Administration Circular calling for the

officers subjected to political victimization who wish to seek relief, to submit their

appeals to be considered by a committee comprising of three retired public officers

appointed by the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration. As the 18th Amendment

to the Constitution came into force with effect from 09th September 2010, the powers

12 Produced marked P 3.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 19 of 28

in relation to the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal

of public officers including the police officers was with the Public Service Commission

and the power to provide for and determine all matters regarding public officers

including the police officers, was with the Cabinet of Ministers.

It was in the year 2016 that the Cabinet of Ministers had decided (P 9) to direct the

Secretary Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development to implement the

proposals recommended by the Basnayake Committee treating that decision as a

matter of Policy. The law had changed by that time as the 19th Amendment to the

Constitution came into force with effect from 15th May 2015.

The 19th Amendment to the Constitution re-transferred the powers in relation to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers

back to the National Police Commission from the hands of the Public Service

Commission. It re-introduced an article numbered 155G in the following form;

155G. (1) (a) The appointment, promotion transfer, disciplinary control and

dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police, shall

be vested in the Commission. The Commission shall exercise its powers of

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal in consultation with

the InspectorGeneral of Police.

(3) The Commission shall, in consultation with the Inspector-General of

Police, provide for and determine all matters regarding police officers,

including:-

(a) the formulation of schemes of recruitment, promotion and

transfers, subject to any policy determined by the Cabinet of Ministers

pertaining to the same;

(b) training and the improvement of the efficiency and independence

of the police service;

(c) the nature and type of the arms, ammunition and other equipment

necessary for the use of the National Division and the Provincial

Divisions; and

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 20 of 28

(d) codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.

(4) The Commission shall exercise all such powers and discharge and

perform all such functions and duties as are vested in it under Appendix I

of List I contained in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.

Thus, after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution it was the National Police

Commission which was charged with the power to provide for and determine all

matters regarding police officers, including the formulation of schemes of recruitment

and promotion in consultation with the Inspector-General of Police, subject to any

policy determined by the Cabinet of Ministers pertaining to the same. This was the

legal position existed when the Cabinet of Ministers made the decision contained in P

9 on 09-08-2016.

Let me now examine the scope of power that should have been exercised by the

Cabinet of Ministers at the relevant time. It is important to bear in mind that the

policies the Cabinet of Ministers are empowered to make must be only to lay down

mere schemes of promotions in the nature of general rules and regulations and not

decisions to promote any individual public or Police officer. On the other hand, any

recommendation made by the Cabinet of Ministers to promote individuals cannot be

categorized as policy decisions falling under Article 55(1) or 155G 3(a) of the

Constitution. This is reflected in the following judicial precedence which interpreted

Article 55 as it had stood at the times of those relevant judgments.

The case of Abeywickrema Vs. Pathirana,13 is an election petition where the petitioner

in that case challenged the validity of the election of the 1st respondent in that case

as a Member of Parliament for Akmeemana electorate. The said petitioner sought a

declaration that the election of the said respondent is void in law on the ground that

he was a public officer and was therefore disqualified under Article 91 (1) (d) (vii) of

the Constitution for election as a Member of Parliament. The said respondent was a

principal of a school coming under the Department of Education which meant that he

was a public officer. The petitioner in that case argued that although the 1st

respondent in that case (school principal) had submitted a letter of resignation from

13 1986 (1) Sri L. R. 120.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 21 of 28

the said public service position, that letter of resignation was neither submitted nor

accepted by the due authority. This was because the 1st respondent in that case

(school principal) had tendered his resignation to the Regional Director of Education

of the area where he was serving and getting that resignation accepted by the

Regional Director who relieved him from his duties; according to the petitioner in that

case, the said process did not effectively terminate the services of the said 1st

respondent (school principal) as a public officer, to qualify him as a candidate at a

parliamentary election. It was on that basis that the said petitioner sought to argue

that there had been no valid resignation in fact or in law by the said 1st respondent

school principal who was therefore disqualified under the aforementioned provision to

be a Member of Parliament as he had continued to hold a public office. Delivering the

majority judgment of Court in 1986, Chief Justice Sharvananda interpreting Article

55(4) of 1978 Constitution as it stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution,

held that the Constitution of 1978 has given a statutory dimension to the

Establishments Code and the said 1st respondent (school principal) was bound by

section 4 of the Establishments Code to obtain proper acceptance of his resignation.

The Chief Justice further holding, that the said letter of resignation did not bring about

a valid termination of the said school principal’s contract of service because it was

neither addressed nor accepted by the Appointing Authority i.e., the Educational

Services Committee; and that the Regional Director, Galle is not the proper authority

to accept the resignation; went on to state in his judgment the following;

“Article 55(4) empowers the Cabinet of Ministers to make rules for all matters

relating to public officers, without impinging upon the overriding powers of

pleasure recognised under Article 55(1). Matters relating to 'public officer'

comprehends all matters relating to employment, which are incidental to

employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment,

such as provisions as to salary, increments, leave, gratuity, pension, and of

superannuity, promotion and every termination of employment and removal

from service. The power conferred on the Cabinet of Ministers is a power to

make rules which are general in their operation though they may be applied

to a particular class of public officers. This power is a legislative power and

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 22 of 28

this rule making function is for the purpose identified in Article 55(4) of the

Constitution as legislative not executive or judicial in character.”

His Lordship Justice Wanasundara who was one of the members of the five-judge

bench which heard the above case, did not agree with the majority judgment in that

case and delivered a dissenting judgment. However, His Lordship Wanasundara J cited

the above passage in his judgment in the case of The Public Service United Nurses

Union Vs. Montague Jayawickrama, Minister of Public Administration and others.14 This

was because the majority judgment in Abeywickrema ‘s case which existed at the time

was binding on Court.

In that case, the Public Services United Nurses Union (Petitioner) to which the majority

of the Government nurses at that time had belonged, struck work demanding an

increase in their salaries. The strike was considered illegal because the relevant

service was declared an essential service by His Excellency the President under the

Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and Powers) Regulation No. 3 of 1986. The

Government then decided to treat those who struck work as having vacated their posts

and took steps to evict those who occupied Government quarters. However, the strike

was eventually settled, the notices of vacation of post were withdrawn and those

nurses were allowed to resume work without loss of back pay. Subsequently, the

Cabinet of Ministers decided to award a special ad hoc benefit of two increments to

the nurses who were members of a rival trade union i.e., the Public Services United

Nurses Union, who had worked during the entirety of the strike period and one

increment to the nurses who reported for duty at various later stages. The petitioner

union challenged the said Cabinet decision on the basis that it was a serious

infringement of its members’ fundamental right of equality guaranteed under Article

12 of the Constitution. His Lordship Justice Wanasundara having noted that an

increment in the public service according to the existing rules and regulations has to

be earned by a public officer by satisfactory work and conduct during a specified period

of time, namely, one year; and any stoppage, postponement or deprivation of an

increment has to be in the nature of a penalty consequent to disciplinary action against

a public officer; and held that instantly rewarding particular public officers with one or

14 1988 1 Sri L. R. 229.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 23 of 28

two increments and placing the others at a disadvantage in relation to them, goes

against the grain of the existing administrative provisions and the legitimate

expectations which public servants entertain based on the principles and policies

existing in the Establishments Code and the Administrative Regulations. Justice

Wanasundara went on to state in the judgment, the following as well;

“When Article 55 of the Constitution vests authority over public affairs in the

Cabinet and make it mandatory for the Cabinet to formulate schemes of

recruitment, and codes of conduct for public officers, the principles to be

followed in making promotions and transfers etc., the Constitution

contemplated fair, and uniform provisions in the nature of general rules and

regulations and not action that is arbitrary or ad hoc or savouring of bias or

discrimination”.15

Time and again, this Court has held that the promotions of public servants must be

carried out according to the schemes specified by the Government. The seniority of a

public servant has always been an important component which is required to be given

due weight in such schemes. In the case of A. H. Wickramatunga and three others

Vs. H. R. de Silva and fourteen others,16 the Supreme Court referred to the principles

in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and

stated as follows;

“….[I]n a scheme of promotion based on ‘Seniority’ and ‘Merit’, sufficient

weightage must always be given to ‘Merit’ based upon a proper assessment

of actual past performance: efficiency, productivity, timeliness, accuracy,

initiative, creativity, ability to work with others, co-operation etc. Article 7

of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

recognizes the right to an “equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted

in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no

considerations other than those of seniority and competence.”

[Emphasis Added]

15 Supra, at page 237; this case also interpreted Article 55 as it stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. 16 SC (FR) 551/98; decided on 31-08-2001.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 24 of 28

His Lordship Justice Fernando may have thought it fit to refer to ICESCR in the above

case because the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has become a state party

to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in

1980 by way of accession.

In the instant case, the observations of the president (9R9), referred to in the relevant

cabinet decision to preserve the seniority of the serving police officers is in conformity

with the above principle. In terms of Article 155 G of the Constitution, the National

Police Commission which was vested with the powers relating to promotions of Police

officers at the relevant time, was required to act in consultation with the Inspector

General of Police. Thus, it was in order for the National Police Commission, to take

into consideration, the relevant observations of the Inspector General of Police (10th

Respondent) marked P 10 and P 10 A. This Court cannot ignore the seniority of the

serving police officers and give directions to promote officers who are less senior

merely because the political victimization committee had recommended to do so. The

Supreme Court cannot be, and should not become, a mere rubber stamp to endorse

any such recommendation of a political victimization committee.

The Case of Poojya Mawanane Sominda Thero and thirteen others Vs. V. K.

Nanayakkara and eleven others,17 also stands as a good example to understand the

scope of power vested in the Cabinet of Ministers to provide for matters of policy. That

case was in relation to an implementation of a Cabinet decision concerning Pirivena

Education. The Petitioners in that case were Lecturers attached to the

Seethawakapura Pirivena Teacher Training Institute at Avissawella and Coordinators

attached to the Provincial Education Offices. They claimed that according to Pirivena

Education Act, No. 64 of 1979, the Government assumed the responsibility of assisting

Pirivena education to function parallel to education offered by State. In order to

recommend inter alia, changes that should be effected to the above Act, the

Government appointed a committee in 1994 to submit its recommendations to the

Ministry of Education. The said petitioners sought the implementation of the Cabinet

decision based on the afore-stated recommendations. The petitioners in that case

complained to Court, that the relevant Committee of the Public Service Commission

17 SC (FR) 146/2003; decided on 15-07-2004.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 25 of 28

should have implemented the said policy decisions and the non-implementation of

those recommendations had caused a serious violation of their fundamental rights.

Her Ladyship Justice Shirani A Bandaranayake,18 having considered whether the

relevant decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers pertains to a matter of policy

coming under the purview of Article 55(4) introduced by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution, stated in her judgment as follows.

The Concise Oxford Dictionary refers to a matter of policy as the 'course or

general plan of action to be adopted by government, party or a person'.

Professor Galligan, on the other hand, defines a decision of policy in the

following words (Due Process and Fair Procedures, Clarendon Press,

Oxford, 1996, pg. 454),

"A decision of policy is one where the authority has to draw on general

considerations of a social, economic or ethical kind in deciding an issue,

where the decision is likely to affect a range of groups and interests."

Accordingly, the general norm in the definition of 'a policy matter' would

be for the action taken to be for the common good. As pointed out by

Professor Galligan (supra) while interests and claims of individuals and

groups are ingredients to be added to the cauldron of policy- making the

final decision should reach beyond particular concerns to a broader sense

of the interests of all". The necessity for the generalization therefore would

be the essential ingredient in defining 'policy' and this is clear as one

examines the meaning given to the said word in the Oxford Companion to

Law, where it reads thus:

"The general consideration which a governing body has in mind in

legislating, deciding on a course of action or otherwise acting (David

Walker; Clarendon Press Oxford, 1980. pg.965)."

Therefore, a policy decision necessarily will have to be applicable in

general and cannot be interpreted to include specified persons.

18 (Later became Chief Justice).

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 26 of 28

The Cabinet Memorandum dated 03.09.2001 (1 R3) basically deals with 3

main items. The first item is with regard to the creation of a post designated

as Assistant/Deputy Director (Pirivena) for each Provincial Department of

Education. The second item refers to the absorption of 8 priests who were

holding the positions as Pirivena Coordinators in different provinces. The

third item is the upgrading of the ten Lecturers presently attached to the

Sudharmarama Pirivena at Avissawella. An examination of the said items

would clearly indicate that item 1.1 of the Memorandum clearly deals with

a policy matter as it relates in general to the creation of a specific post.

The second limb of this item, viz., item 1.2 however refers to the

appointment of 8 selected persons and thereby is not in a category which

deals with policy matters. This could have been avoided, if there was no

special reference to the appointment of 8 persons who were holding

positions as Pirivena Co-ordinators. The next item in the Memorandum is

not dealing with a policy matter as it clearly refers to the absorption of 10

lecturers who had been serving for a period of over 10 years at the

Sudharmarama Pirivena at Avissawella.

In the circumstances, it is apparent that the first item which deals with

the creation of a post designated as Assistant/Deputy Director (Pirivena)

for each Provincial Department of Education deals with a policy matter and

the other two items do not come within the category of policy.

Furthermore, in Black's Law Dictionary a policy is defined: in its 5th edition, as ‘The

general principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs,

or the legislature in its measures’ ; and in its 11th edition, as ‘A standard course of

action that has been officially established by an organization, business, political party,

etc.’ Thus, all the above material clearly indicate that a policy decision must be

applicable in general as opposed to specific individuals. If a particular policy decision

focuses on specific individuals and fails to be applicable in a general context, it will not

fall within the ambit of a policy decision.

Therefore, it is apparent that in the instant case, the petitioners cannot rely on the

relevant Cabinet Decision to get relief on the basis that their names are included in a

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 27 of 28

report of a political victimization committee as such a decision cannot be considered

as a decision pertaining to a matter of policy for the aforementioned reasons.

I need to mention here a yet another relevant matter. We have a legal system which

reasonably protects the citizens’ rights including fundamental rights. In such a

situation the Petitioners who complain about infringement of their fundamental rights

must first show as to why they did not seek an appropriate relief from Court at the

time they were politically victimized, if in fact such a victimization had occurred as

alleged. On the other hand, if the Petitioners had indeed sought relief from a Court,

they should have revealed the details and outcome of such action. The absence of the

above explanations, would further vitiate the Petitioners’ claim that they were indeed

politically victimized. Thus, the Petitioners cannot now complain that their fundamental

rights have been violated by the Cabinet of Ministers which anyway did not have power

to deal with individual promotions as shown above. This Court cannot directly or

indirectly enforce recommendations made solely on political reasons, by implementing

recommendations made by a Political Victimization Committee. Such actions would

indeed negate the advancement of equal protection of law principle enshrined in

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Let me conclude this judgment citing the following passage from the judgment of Her

Ladyship Justice Shirani Bandaranayake (as she then was) in the case of Farook Vs

Dharmaratne, Chairman, Provincial Public Service Commission, Uva and others.19

The petitioner's relief sought from this Court is to declare that his transfer

as Principal of Pitarathmale No. 1 Tamil Vidyalaya, Haputale and the 6th

respondent's transfer as Principal of Sri Razick Fareed Maha Vidyalaya,

Bandarawela are null and void. In view of the forgoing analysis of the

material placed before this Court the petitioner has no right to be the

Principal of Razick Fareed Maha Vidyalaya as he has not got the requisite

qualifications. However, the petitioner quite clearly has sought to obtain

relief on the basis of unequal treatment. When a person does not possess

the required qualifications that is necessary for a particular position, would

it be possible for him to obtain relief in terms of a violation of his

19 2005 (1) Sri L. R. 133 at page 140.

SC (FR) 350/2016 - Page 28 of 28

fundamental rights on the basis of unequal treatment ? If the answer to

this question is in the affirmative, it would mean that Article 12(1) of the

Constitution would be applicable even in a situation where there is no

violation of the applicable legal procedure or the general practice. The

application of Article 12(1) of the Constitution cannot be used for such

situations as it provides to an aggrieved person only for the equal

protection of the law where the authorities have acted illegally or

incorrectly without giving due consideration to the applicable guidelines.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution does not provide for any situation where

the authorities will have to act illegally. The safeguard retained in Article

12(1) is for the performance of a lawful act and not to be directed to carry

out an illegal function. In order to succeed the petitioner must be in a

position to place material before this Court that there has been unequal

treatment within the framework of a lawful act.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, The Petitioners are not entitled

to succeed with the prayers in this application. I dismiss this application but without

costs.
