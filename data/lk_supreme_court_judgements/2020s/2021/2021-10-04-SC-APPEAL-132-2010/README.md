Decided on: 04.10.2021

Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (Respondent) instituted this action in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya for the partition of the land called Nelligahamula Watta

alias Parahena alias Parawatta containing in extent A.2 R.2 P.8. There is no dispute

between the parties as to the identity of the corpus. It is admitted that the corpus

is more fully depicted in preliminary plan No. 3524 dated 21.03.1997 (X) prepared

by licensed surveyor R.B. Navaratne.

Parties are also in agreement that Punchi Banda Ratnayake was allotted this land

by partition decree in case No. 1553/P of District Court of Kurunegala dated

02.03.1972. The dispute revolves on the pedigree pleaded by the Respondent and

the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (Appellant).

7

According to the Respondent, Punchi Banda Ratnayake transferred an undivided

one acre of the corpus to the Respondent by deed No. 3223 (P2) dated 15.03.1995

attested by R.K.R.F.J. Caldera, Notary Public. It is further contended that Punchi

Banda Ratnayake died issueless on 24.09.1995 and therefore his brothers, sisters

and their heirs, including the Appellant, succeeded to the balance portion of the

corpus on intestate succession.

The Appellant on the contrary contends that Punchi Banda Ratnayake executed two

deeds of transfer in favour of the Appellant, namely deed No. 5401 dated

21.09.1977 (4V3) for a divided one acre of the corpus and deed No. 908 dated

11.11.1980 (4V4) for a further undivided 1 acre of the corpus. Alternatively, the

Appellant contends that he has acquired prescriptive title to the corpus and sought

a dismissal of the partition action.

The learned District Judge held that the paper title claimed by the Appellant lost

priority to the paper title claimed by the Respondent since the two deeds relied on

by the Appellant, namely deed No. 5401 dated 21.09.1977 (4V3) and deed No. 908

dated 11.11.1980 (4V4), were not registered in the correct folio in the land registry

whereas deed No. 3223 (P2) relied on by the Respondent was registered in a folio

which was connected to the folio in which the final decree in case No. 1553/P of

District Court of Kurunegala was registered.

However, the learned District Judge concluded that the Appellant had prescribed

to the corpus and dismissed the partition action.

The Respondent appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal holden in Kurunegala.

The High Court of Civil Appeal held that Punchi Banda Ratnayake possessed the

corpus until his demise and that he had taken income derived from the coconut

cultivation on the corpus. It was held further that the Appellant had failed to prove

any ouster. The High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the District

Court and directed that the corpus be partitioned on the pedigree pleaded by the

Respondent. Aggrieved by this judgment, the Appellant has filed this appeal.

8

Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law:

(a) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court seriously misdirect

themselves when they held that the subject matter of this case is co-owned land?

(b) Did their Lordships Court of the Civil Appellate High Court fail to consider the

finding of the Learned District Judge that the 4thDefendant/Respondent/Petitioner

had exclusive possession for the corpus since 1980 although the 5th

Defendant/Respondent/Respondent had undivided rights for only 10 perches (A0-

R0-P10)?

I observe that Punchi Banda Ratnayake became the sole owner of the land sought

to be partitioned by virtue of partition decree in case No. 1553/P of District Court

of Kurunegala dated 02.03.1972. The land became co-owned again when he

executed deed 5051 (4V1) dated 14.10.1976 for an undivided 1 acre in favour of

Asilin Nona. A further undivided 1 acre was transferred by him again to Asilin None

by deed No. 5105 (4V4) dated 19.12.1976.

The total extent of land transferred to Asilin Nona as aforesaid was re-transferred

by her to Punchi Banda Ratnayake by deed Nos. 6274 (4V6) dated 10.11.1980 and

deed No. 5400 (4V5) dated 21.09.1977.

Punchi Banda Ratnayake transferred 2 acres in total to the Appellant by deed No.

5401 (4V3) dated 21.09.1977, which is for an undivided one acre, followed by deed

No. 908 (4V4) dated 11.11.1980, which is for an undivided 1 acre.

Hence by 11.11.1980, the Appellant had paper title for an undivided 2 acres and

Punchi Banda Ratnayake held an undivided 8 perches of the corpus.

9

In evaluating the claim of prescriptive rights by the Appellant, one must bear in

mind two significant legal principles governing prescriptive rights among co-

owners.

In Corea v. Appuhamy et al. (15 N.L.R. 65) the Privy Council held that, in law, the

possession of one co-owner is also the possession of his co-owners and that it was

not possible to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind

and that nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could put an

end to that possession.

Moreover as the Appellant and Punchi Banda Ratnayake are brothers, the required

proof of change in the character of possession to adverse is greater than in a case

where the parties are total outsiders [De Silva v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (80 N.L.R. 292)].

It was incumbent on the Appellant to prove a starting point for his prescriptive

rights. His evidence is that he began possessing the corpus from 1980. This

coincides with the execution of deed No. 908 (4V4) dated 11.11.1980 after which

he became the owner of an undivided 2 acres of the corpus. However, the

possession of the Appellant did not in my view take the character of adverse

possession from such inception due to the absence of evidence of change of

character as the Appellant entered possession as a co-owner. [Chelliah v.

Wijenathan (54 N.L.R. 337 at 342)].

10

Nonetheless, it is in evidence that between 1982/1984 the Appellant constructed a

building on the corpus consisting of three rooms, which are being used as shops.

This is shown in the preliminary plan No. 3524 (X) dated 21.03.1997 prepared by

licensed surveyor R.B. Navaratne and was claimed only by the Appellant during the

preliminary survey. Kareem Ismail testified that he constructed this building at the

request of the Appellant who paid for its construction. At the preliminary survey,

none of the other parties including the Respondent, claimed that these buildings

were being held in common [Appeal Brief, page 105]. In my view these facts are

cogent evidence in establishing the beginning of adverse possession in favour of

the Appellant.

This position is further buttressed with the evidence that the Appellant leased these

shops to third parties and exclusively appropriated the rentals to the exclusion of

any other. The Appellant, by deed No. 7191 (4V7) dated 15.08.1984, leased one of

the shops to Devendra for a period of five years from 15.08.1984. Chandralatha, a

sister of Devendra, testified that she and her brother leased this shop from the

Appellant in 1984 and that she is in occupation of it even as at 2002 when she

testified. During her cross-examination on behalf of the Respondent, she testified

that the rental was paid to the Appellant and that no rental was ever paid to Punchi

Banda Ratnayake and that one Jayasekera who was occupying another shop also

paid rent to the Appellant. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

Respondent failed to challenge this evidence. Moreover, the Respondent testified

that the present occupiers of the shops on the corpus are in occupation under the

Appellant [Appeal Brief, page 92].

11

The Appellant also led the evidence of one Nandasoma who testified that he took

on lease the corpus from the Appellant in 1981 for eight years to cultivate pineapple

and that the cultivation covered an extent of 1 acres of the corpus. Although no

documentary evidence of the lease was produced, Nandasoma claimed that the

receipt was lost, the 5th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent corroborated the fact

that there was a pineapple cultivation on the corpus.

In order to counter the case of the Appellant, the Respondent testified that Punchi

Banda Ratnayake possessed the corpus until his death in 1995 and used to live in a

small house on the corpus [Appeal Brief, page 95]. However, it was mere ipse dixit

and in this context it is important to bear in mind the principle that mere statements

of possession are insufficient to establish prescriptive rights. It is necessary that the

witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be

decided thereupon by Court [Sirajudeen and two others v. Abbas (1994) 2 Sri.L.R.

365]. In any event, this evidence was contradicted by the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent who testified that Punchi Banda Ratnayake lived in a small

room on a land adjoining the corpus belonging to one of his brothers [Appeal Brief,

page 173].

More importantly, the fact that Punchi Banda Ratnayake continued to possess the

corpus is not credible given that he lost his undivided 8 perches share in the corpus

when he executed deed No. 1866 (5V4) dated 04.11.1985 by which it was

transferred to one Herath Mudiyanselage Jayatilake who later transferred his share

by deed No. 2314 (5V5) dated 01.09.1988 to the 10th Defendant-Respondent-

Respondent. No evidence was led that either of them possessed the corpus

thereafter. In fact, the preliminary plan No. 3524 dated 21.03.1997 (X) shows that

the corpus has been possessed as one unit and that there are no boundaries

indicating it as having being possessed as two distinct lots.

12

Hence, there is cogent evidence to establish that the Appellant had prescribed to

the corpus by the time this action was filed in November 1995 as correctly held by

the learned District Judge.

No doubt the Appellant did admit that the 5th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent

had paper title to the balance undivided 8 perches. However, this admission was

erroneous. Moreover the 5th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent testified that he

did not enter into possession of the undivided 8 perches.

In any event, mere acknowledgement of the paper title of the 5th Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent by the Appellant cannot, in my view, stand in the way of

setting up a claim of prescriptive title as it is by very nature a mode of defeating

paper title. In Wijesundera & Others v. Constantine Dasa and Another [(1987) 2

Sri.L.R. 66], G.P.S. De Silva J. (as he was then) held that the knowledge on the part

of the defendant that title to the property was in another was not a bar to his claim

to prescriptive title, but tended rather to strengthen their claim, having regard to

all the facts and circumstances of that case. In my view, it applies with equal force

to the facts and circumstances of this case as well.

More significantly, the 5th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent did not prefer any

appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge who held that the

Appellant had established his prescriptive rights to the full extent of the corpus.

For the foregoing reasons, the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in concluding that

the Appellant had failed to establish his prescriptive title. Accordingly, I answer the

two questions of law in the affirmative.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal holden in Kurunegala

dated 17.12.2009 and affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Kuliyapitiya dated 11.11.2002 and direct that decree be entered accordingly.

Registrar is directed to take steps accordingly.

13

The Appellant is entitled to his costs in both the High Court of Civil Appeal holden

in Kurunegala and this Court.

Appeal allowed.
