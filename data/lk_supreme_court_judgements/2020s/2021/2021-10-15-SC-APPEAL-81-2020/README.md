Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action seeking to partition the land

described in the schedule to the plaint between the plaintiff and

the 1st defendant in equal shares. After trial, the District Judge

dismissed the action. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal

set aside the Judgment of the District Court and directed the

District Court to enter the Interlocutory Decree as prayed for by

the plaintiff ( share of the land to the plaintiff and share to

the 1st defendant).

7

SC/APPEAL/81/2020

The 1st plaintiff in her statement of claim inter alia stated that

she transferred her undivided share to her two daughters (the

3rd and 4th defendants) by deed No. 8474. This was reiterated in

the statement of claim of the 4th defendant. The deed was

produced at the trial marked 4V1 through the evidence of the

plaintiff.

Unfortunately, the existence of this deed escaped the attention

of the High Court of Civil Appeal when it delivered the Judgment

dated 29.06.2016.

Thereafter the 4th defendant filed a revision application in the

High Court of Civil Appeal seeking to rectify this error. By

Judgment dated 16.12.2019, the High Court of Civil Appeal

dismissed this application on the basis that it is settled law that

the rights of the parties shall be determined at the institution of

the action and, as this deed had been executed after the

institution of the partition action, the Court could not give effect

to it.

The 4th defendant is before this Court against this Judgment of

the High Court of Civil Appeal. This Court granted leave to

appeal on the question whether the High Court of Civil Appeal

erred in law when it dismissed the application of the 4th

defendant on the basis that the rights of the parties in a

partition action shall be determined at the institution of the

action.

The High Court of Civil Appeal has clearly misdirected itself in

law on this point. A partition action cannot be equated to an

ordinary civil action.

8

SC/APPEAL/81/2020

Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code defines action as a

proceeding for the prevention or redress of a wrong and cause of

action as the wrong for the prevention or redress of which an

action may be brought, and includes the denial of a right, the

refusal to fulfill an obligation, the neglect to perform a duty and

the infliction of an affirmative injury. Partition actions are

considered actions which fall not under section 5 of the Civil

Procedure Code but under section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code

which enacts Every application to a court for relief or remedy

obtainable through the exercise of the courts power or authority,

or otherwise to invite its interference, constitutes an action.

Every action is based on a cause of action, but partition actions

are not based on a cause of action as defined in section 5 of the

Civil Procedure Code. If at all there is a cause of action in a

partition action, it is based on the inherent right of every co-

owner to have a divided portion of the land in lieu of common

ownership, or to have his proportionate share in the proceeds of

the sale of the land in the event a sale is ordered instead of

partition. (Abeysundara v. Babuna (1925) 26 NLR 459, Marshal

Perera v. Elizabeth Fernando (1956) 60 NLR 229, Kiribanda v.

Weerappu Chettiar (1948) 50 NLR 490)

I must also add that although on the face of the record there are

plaintiffs and defendants in a partition action, all parties in a

partition action play the dual role of plaintiff and defendant.

This is made clear, inter alia, by sections 19, 25 and 70 of the

Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977. Partition actions are sui generis

and unique.

According to section 66 of the Partition Law, voluntary

alienations are void if they have been effected after a partition

9

SC/APPEAL/81/2020

action is duly registered as a lis pendens under the Registration

of Documents Ordinance.

The registration of the lis pendens is a significant milestone in a

partition action. It is after the registration of the lis pendens

that the attorney-at-law for the plaintiff is required to file the

section 12 declaration which ensures that all persons involved in

transactions affecting the land to be partitioned up to the point

of the registration of the lis pendens are made parties to the

action. In terms of section 13, even summonses are issued to

the defendants only after the lis pendens is registered.

The High Court of Civil Appeal admits that this deed was

executed after the institution of the action but before the lis

pendens was registered. Hence this is not an invalid deed in

terms of the Partition Law. The deed 4V1 is not a disputed deed.

Nor does any party object to the application of the 4th defendant.

I answer the question of law in the affirmative and set aside the

Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 16.12.2019

and direct the learned District Judge to amend the Interlocutory

Decree giving effect to the deed 4V1. In the result, the plaintiff

is entitled to share and the 3rd and 4th defendants are each

entitled to share in the corpus. No costs.
