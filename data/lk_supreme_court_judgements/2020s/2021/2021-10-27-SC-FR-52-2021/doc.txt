Judgement

Aluwihare PC. J.,

The Petitioners in the present application were granted leave to proceed for the alleged

infringement, of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 12(2)

of the Constitution.

The 1st Petitioner is the mother of the 2nd Petitioner who is a minor. The Petitioners

allege that the 2nd Petitioner was denied admission to Grade 1 of the Dharmasoka

Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda, for the Academic year 2021 citing the failure to meet the

requirements under Clause 7.2. (‘Children of residents in proximity to school’

category) of Circular No. 29/2019 issued by the Ministry of Education (‘P3’).

The Circular ‘P3’ sets out the scheme of Grade 1 admissions to Government Schools.

Clause 7.0. lists the categories under which applicants may seek admission and the

percentages of students to be admitted under the respective categories. The Petitioners

had applied under the category of ‘Children of residents in proximity to school’

referred to in Clause 7.0.

Clause 7.2. Of ‘P3’ requires that, to be eligible under the said category, mandatorily,

applicants should be resident at the address they are applying from and should be

able to prove their residency at the said address through documentary evidence.

In order to apply for a particular school, the applicant should be resident within the

‘feeder area’ of the school. As per Clause 4.7. the ‘feeder area’ is the administrative

district area that the school is situated in. When a school is situated on the border of

an administrative district area, the nearest divisional secretariat division of the other

administrative district near the border should be considered as the feeder area.

Clause 7.1.5. sets out the procedure in which the proximity of the place of residence

to the school is to be determined. It requires that a circle be drawn taking the distance

from the main door of the applicant’s residence to the front door of the Main office of

the school of which admission is sought (where the Primary Section is situated in a

5

different premises, the distance to that Office), as the radius. (“b,a¨ï lrk mdif,a

m%Odk ld¾hd,hg ^m%d:ñl wxYh m%Odk mdi,ska neyer fjk;a mßY%hl mj;skafka

kï tu ld¾hd,hg& we;s ÿr”& .

Marks are to be deducted for each other Government School with a Primary Section

to which the applicant can be admitted, situate within the circle. The marks to be

deducted per each such school is 5, as per Clause 7.4.5. of ‘P3’. According to the

Circular, the allocation of marks for the ‘Children of residents in proximity to school’

category are as follows;

Place of residence 20 marks

Other documents 05 marks

Electoral records 25 marks

Proximity to School 50 marks

Total 100 marks

The Petitioners had been called for an interview on 8th September 2020. At the

interview, the 1st Petitioner had submitted a true copy of the property deed of the

residence of the 1st Petitioner, Certificate of Character and Residence issued by the

Grama Niladhari, electricity bills, water bills, documents relating to assessment rates,

the Pregnancy record book of the 1st Petitioner and electoral records along with the

school admission application form and the birth certificate of the 2nd Petitioner, as

documentary proof of residence. The 2nd Petitioner had been allocated 92.4% marks

which were over and above the cutoff mark, which was 90%. 5 Marks had been

deducted, as per clause 7.4.5. for Devananda Vidyalaya situated within the circle, and

the 1st Petitioner states that she did not oppose it as they had obtained marks above

the cutoff mark. In confirmation of the acceptance of the marks, the Petitioner had

signed at the foot of the mark sheet (‘P10’). The Petitioners state that at the conclusion

of the interview, the 2nd Petitioner was declared eligible for admission.

6

The Petitioners assert that they fulfilled the admission criteria in the manner referred

to above and the awarding of sufficient marks [92.4%], afforded them a legitimate

expectation of gaining admission to the school.

On 15th November 2020, the 3rd to 7th Respondents as members of the Board of

Interview had visited the residence of the Petitioners for a site inspection, while the

Petitioners were not at home. They had inspected and photographed the premises. The

Principal had informed the Petitioners via a phone call that the representatives were

at their house for the site inspection. The Petitioners state that they were not at home

at that time, and were on their way home.

On 3rd December 2020, a staff officer of the school had informed the1st Petitioner, via

telephone, to be present on 4th December 2020 for a discussion regarding the

admission of the 2nd Petitioner to the school. At the discussion on that day, the 1st

Petitioner alleges that she was asked to place her signature on the cover of a file

without explaining the content, that was in English. The Respondents, however, deny

this allegation and state that the notes explaining the unsatisfactory proof regarding

residence at the given address were made in Sinhala and not in English, as evinced by

‘R8’.

On a subsequent occasion, the 1st Petitioner along with the Chief Incumbent priest of

the Shri Niketharamaya temple, had gone to meet the Principal to inquire whether the

2nd Petitioner could secure admission to the school. However, the 1st Petitioner had

been informed that the 2nd Petitioner could not be admitted to the school as there was

another school (in addition to Devananda Maha Vidyalaya) situated within the circle,

namely Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya. The Petitioner had been informed that as

required by Clause 4.7. of ‘P3’ a further 5 marks had to be deducted from the marks

originally awarded, in addition to the earlier deduction of marks for Devananda Maha

Vidyalaya.

The Petitioners contend that, whereas both Dharmasoka Vidyalaya and Devananda

Vidyalaya are situated within the Ambalangoda educational division, the said

Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya is situated within the educational division of Balapitiya,

7

although all three schools are situated within the same administrative district. The

crux of their argument is that, Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya therefore should not be

considered as a school that fall within the circle and that marks should not be

deducted due to the location of the said Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya as that is not the

objective of Clause 4.7. of ‘P3’. The Respondents, however, contend that, as the

Balapitiya Divisional Secretariat is situated within the Galle District, as is Dharmasoka

Vidyalaya, marks must be deducted for the said school as well.

The ‘temporary list’ (‘P11’) displayed in or around 23rd December 2020 announcing

the names of the candidates who were provisionally selected, had not contained the

name of the 2nd Petitioner, although the names of at least 2 candidates with marks

lower than that of the Petitioner were included (No. 89 and 90).

The Petitioners state that after the lapse of about a week since the release of the

temporary list, the 3rd Respondent and a few others had visited the residence of the

Petitioners, at which time the father, sister’s son and brother-in-law of the 1st

Petitioner were present in the premises.

On 31st December 2020, the 1st Petitioner had preferred an appeal to the Board of

Appeal (‘P12’) in terms of Clause 11 of ‘P3’ impugning the exclusion of the 2nd

Petitioner from the temporary list.

The hearing of the appeal had been held on17th January 2021, with the participation

of the1st Petitioner and the 8th to 12th Respondents. According to the 1st Petitioner, she

had been informed that the 2nd Petitioner cannot be admitted to the school as it was

difficult to accept the proof of residence due to the unkempt condition the premises

were in at the time of the inspection, indicating that the house was, in fact, not

occupied. The 1st Petitioner alleges that she was informed of this decision without a

re-examination of the requisite documents or conducting a proper hearing according

to the procedure specified in ‘P3’. The 2nd Petitioner was awarded 77.4% marks by the

Appeal Board, and the Petitioner alleged that no justifiable reasons were given for the

reduction of marks from the original 92.4% marks awarded by the Interview Board.

8

The Petitioners contend that this is non-compliant with Clause 11 and 18 of ‘P3’

which pertain to ensuring a just and fair process of appeal.

The Respondents maintain that no marks were deducted on the basis of the state of

the residence of the Petitioners. The 1st Petitioner had refused to sign the document

(‘R9’) on which the Respondents had reduced the marks previously awarded. The

notation the 1st Petitioner had made on ‘R9’ stating that she is unwilling to sign the

document was not denied at the hearing, by the Petitioner.

The final list of students selected for Dharmasoka Vidyalaya was displayed on 3rd

February 2021 and the 2nd Petitioner’s name was not included in the list, nor in the

waiting list displayed on the website of the school. The 3rd Respondent, by his

communication on 5th February 2021, had informed that the 2nd Petitioner cannot be

admitted to the school as she has not secured the required 90% marks under the

‘proximity’ category.

Consequently, in or around 31st December 2020, the 1st Petitioner tendered appeals

to the President of the Republic, the Secretary of Education (Southern Province) and

the Director of Divisional Education Office, Ambalangoda, and were called to the

Divisional Education Office on 18th January 2021 for the appeal to be considered. The

1st Petitioner states that Ms. D. P. Damayanthi, the Director of Divisional Education

had stated that the 2nd Petitioner had been treated unfairly and that although she had

repeatedly tried to contact the 3rd Respondent she had failed to do so. The Petitioners

state that they have tendered an appeal to the 2nd Respondent, Secretary, Ministry of

Education but that they do not foresee a satisfactory administrative resolution of the

matter.

The Petitioners have filed a complaint to the Human Rights Commission [HRC] dated

5th January 2021 (‘P9’) as well but have subsequently withdrawn it citing personal

difficulties. The 3rd Respondent in his affidavit has taken up the position that the

complaint [to the HRC] has been withdrawn after he submitted his observations to the

Commission.

Awarding of provisional marks based on proximity

It appears that the provisional marks were awarded taking into consideration, inter

alia, the map marked ‘R4’. The Respondents state that it is the usual practice to have

the applicants point out their residence on a Google map that is made available to

them, at the interview. Taking the location of the residence as one point and the

location of the school office as the other, a circle is drawn using the distance between

the said two points as the radius. The map ‘R4’ has been marked in the above manner,

and in that map, other than Dharmasoka Vidyalaya, only Devananda College had

fallen within the radius of the circle. The map ‘R6’ on the other hand, had been drawn

by an official of the Surveyor General’s Department who made the necessary

measurements during the site inspection. ‘R6’ which depicts the applicable circle,

indicates that Devananda Vidyalaya is completely within the circle while a small part

of the Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya also falls within the circle. In the case of the

Dharmasoka Vidyalaya, more than 50 per cent of the school buildings fall within the

circle. For the purposes of this case, reliance can be placed on the map [‘R6’], the same

being drawn by an official of the Survey General’s Department using GPS

measurements.

The initial grounds for reduction of marks as stated in ‘R8’ are that; the Petitioners

were resident in 3 locations during the material time period; that from the site

inspection, it was clear that the house in question was an unoccupied partially built

structure [Photographs ‘R5’ & ‘R5a’] and there was not even a door fixed to the

lavatory; that upon calculation of the distance by the surveyor it was evident that

marks should be deducted for Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya as well.

The Petitioners in their written submissions had contended that the requirements of

Clause 9 regarding site visits have not been followed by the Respondents. Per Clause

9.3.3. records of the site visit should be maintained with the date, time, and the names

and signatures of the persons who conducted the site inspection. The Respondents

have submitted records of the first site inspection signed by the persons who carried

out the inspection marked ‘R7’. In the said records, a second site visit has been

10

suggested in order to ascertain whether the Petitioners were in fact resident there, as

the structure in question has been found to be a house that was being built anew and

yet to be fully completed.

The Petitioners state that the names of the persons who accompanied the 3rd

Respondents on the second site visit are not recorded. Furthermore, if deductions are

made from the awarded marks, the reason for such changes must be disclosed to the

applicant, according to Clause 9.3.3. of ‘P3’. The Respondents, however, had

considered the Petitioners’ application for the admission to the school concerned on

the premise that the Petitioners were residing at the house in question. Thus, even if

it is assumed that the Respondents had not been in total compliance with Clause 9.3.3.

of ‘P3’ in its application, no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners.

There, however, is another factor that needs consideration as far as allocation of

marks is concerned. As confirmed by the ‘Certificate of residence and character’

issued by the Grama Niladhari (‘P7’) the 1st Petitioner has resided at 453/3A, Beach

Road, Heppumulla, Ambalangoda from her date of birth to 22nd May 2016; at 63/4,

R. E. De Silva Mawatha, Heppumulla, Ambalangoda from 23rd May 2016 to 31st

December 2016; and at 43/6B, R. E. De Silva Mawatha, Heppumulla, Ambalangoda

(the address from which the application has been made). It is evident that the

Petitioners had resided at three different locations within the time period material to

the application i.e. the 5-year period immediately before the year, the application for

admission was submitted.

Clause 7.2.2.3. states that when the applicant has been resident in another address

within the feeder area and is submitting electoral records from both addresses in order

to confirm their residence of at least 5 years within the feeder area, both electoral

records can be considered as electoral registers of the present place of residence. Such

consideration, however, can be given only if the schools which are more proximate

than the school to which the child is applying to are the same for both places of

residence. It can be seen that the 1st Petitioner has been a resident within the same

area of Heppumulla for the period from 2015-2019 that was material for the

11

admission process. However, the Petitioners have not submitted material to show that

the ‘schools’ for both addresses are the same thereby starving the court of material to

ascertain whether the benefit of Clause 7.2.2.3. should be given to the Petitioners.

In the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Respondents, the deduction of

marks of the 2nd Petitioner is explained. As the 1st Petitioner has resided at the current

address only for 3 years, marks have been awarded only for those 3 years for both

parents of the applicant, amounting to 15 marks (2.5 x 3 x 2). It should also be noted

that although marks were awarded for the 1st Petitioner’s husband as well, the

electoral records ‘P9’ only pertain to the 1st Petitioner. No evidence of the husband’s

residence in the 5 years material to the application has been submitted. 5 marks were

deducted from the 45 marks that had been originally awarded under the proximity

criteria, for the Kandegoda Maha Vidyalaya as well.

Originally, as indicated by ‘R8’, based on the site visit the Respondents had concluded

that the Petitioners were not resident at the given address. They had, however,

awarded full marks for the documentary evidence submitted without making any

deductions in spite of the fact that the Respondents entertained doubts as to the

Petitioner’s residency at the given address. For the purposes of awarding marks for

residence as confirmed by the electoral records the Respondents have awarded marks

for the 3 years in which the Petitioners have stated that they have been resident at the

given address.

The Respondents further submit that as indicated on the mark sheet ‘R9’ the marks

awarded at the first interview are subject to change if the information provided by the

applicant is revealed to be inaccurate/false, or if it is found by the site inspection that

the applicant is not residing at the given address. The Respondents therefore argue

that no legitimate expectations can be founded on the marks awarded therein.

In addition, the Respondents further state that the Petitioners themselves, in Item No.

5 of their application, have accepted that Devananda Vidyalaya is closer in proximity

than Dharmasoka Vidyalaya. The Respondents further dispute the 1st Petitioner’s

submission that she was residing at the given address with her husband and daughter

12

since 2015 as in the notice of assessment ‘P8c’ submitted by her the property is

described as a ‘land’. The water and electricity bills adduced as additional documents

to establish as proof of residence ‘P8a’ and ‘P8b’ bear dates after the 30th of June 2020,

the closing date for applications.

The Respondents further state that the 2nd Petitioner has been admitted to Devananda

Vidyalaya which was not disclosed to court by the Petitioners.

Upon a perusal of the additional documents submitted as proof of residence by the

Petitioners, it is clear that they do not meet the requirements of the Circular. The water

and electricity bills submitted (‘P8a’ and ‘P8b’) are only of the year 2020 and that too

are not bills dated prior to the application deadline as required. Neither do the bills

indicate at least 5 years of ownership. The single assessment sheet submitted ‘P8c’ is

only regarding the year 2016. The pregnancy record book of the 1st Petitioner (‘P8d’)

indicates the address ‘No. 453/3A, Patabendimulla, Ambalangoda’ an address other

than that of the current residence, which therefore, cannot qualify as proof of

residence at the current address. The electoral records from 2015-2019 (‘P9’)

indicate that the 1st Petitioner was registered in the same electoral district. No electoral

records of the father of the 2nd Petitioner were submitted

The certificate of the Grama Niladari (‘P7’) indicates that the 1st Petitioner was

resident within the same area, though at 3 different addresses during the minimum 5

years material to the application. It should be noted that the Circular does not

recognize the certificate of the Grama Niladari as additional documentary proof of

residence.

Although the Petitioners contend that they are eligible for 100% marks in the category

of proximate residence, it is not so. The documents mentioned above do not satisfy the

requirements of the Circular ‘P3’ to the extent required to gain admission to

Dharmasoka Vidyalaya, despite the fact that the 2nd Petitioner has been a resident

within the Heppumulla, Ambalangoda area for the entirety of her life (vide addresses

in the documents submitted by the 1st Petitioner).

13

The Petitioners have failed to submit documentary proof to sufficiently establish their

residence at the address material to gaining admission to Dharmasoka Vidyalaya. The

Respondent Interview Board and the Board of Appeal have in fact awarded the

applicant the maximum marks that she was entitled to. It is imperative that the

Petitioners fulfil the eligibility criteria before they hasten to impugn the decision of

the Interview Board and the Appeals Board.

It is common knowledge that each year, a considerable number of school admission

applications are submitted for consideration by school authorities and the school staff

is required to go through the tedious process of evaluating such applications. In the

said context, it would be impractical to hold to account each and every minor

oversight or administrative lapse, on the part of the Interview Board, which is not of

any gravity as to cause prejudice and thereby discriminate the applicant. As is clear

from the analysis of the evidence, the maximum marks possible had been awarded to

the Petitioners. Wanasundera J. in Wijesinghe v. Attorney-General [1978-79-80] 1

SLR 102 held “Every wrong decision or breach of the law does not attract the

constitutional remedies relating to fundamental rights.” Under Article 126, the

Supreme Court would intervene in instances where a fundamental right was

breached. In the present case, no such intervention is called for.

When the number of applicants seeking admission to a school exceeds the capacity of

the intake, some criteria has to be adopted to select the number of applicants that the

school can accommodate. The State cannot be held at fault for adopting such a

process. Although the Petitioners’ choice of school may have been Dharmasoka

Vidyalaya, it has been shown that they do not possess the requirements to make it

through the vetting process successfully. In the circumstances the State has provided

the 2nd Petitioner with a school, by admitting her to Devananda Vidyalaya, a school

which is in the vicinity of Dharmasoka Vidyalaya. In this context, it cannot be

concluded that any prejudice or an injustice has been caused to the Petitioners, much

less a breach of the Directive Principles of State policy, the duty to assure “to all

persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels.”

14

There is no evidence to conclude that the Petitioners have been denied equality before

the law or the equal protection of the law. Nor is there any occasion to accept that the

Petitioners were subjected to discrimination on any ground.

Therefore, we do not deem it fit to hold that the Petitioners’ rights under Article 12(1)

and 12(2) have been infringed.

I make no order as to costs.

Application dismissed.
