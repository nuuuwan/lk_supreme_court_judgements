Respondents Before: E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J.

K.K. Wickremasinghe, J. Janak De Silva, J. Counsel: Ravindranath Dabare with Ms. Suwanthi Ponnamperuma for the Petitioners Viveka Siriwardena ASG for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents Argued On: 25.10.2021 Decided On: 01.12.2021 Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioners, by petition dated 3rd April 2021, principally sought to impugn the Cabinet

Memorandum dated 12th March 2021 [P10] submitted by the 1st and 2nd Respondents

titled “Taking a policy decision in respect of tamed elephants where judicial proceedings

and investigations are being conducted and transferring the ownership”. The Cabinet

Memorandum [P10] sought inter alia the approval of the Cabinet Ministers to withdraw

all cases in which legal action is being taken at present and to hand over these animals to

their present owners according to the conditions of transferring these animals. Petitioners

sought inter alia a declaration that the rule of law of the country will be seriously affected

if the members of the executive Cabinet are allowed to interfere with the pending cases

in the courts and allowed to arbitrarily take decisions with regard to pending litigation.

When this application was supported on 20th July 2021, the learned Additional Solicitor

General appearing for the Attorney General brought to the notice of Court that in fact a

Cabinet decision had been taken on 15th March 2021 on the impugned Cabinet

Memorandum [P10] which has not been disclosed by the Petitioners. It was submitted

that the application must be dismissed in limine as the Cabinet of Ministers were not

named Respondents. Subsequently, the Petitioners requested that the Court authorize

the filing of an amended petition, which was strongly opposed by the learned Additional

Solicitor General.

Court allowed the Petitioners to file amended petition subject to any objections of the 1st

and 2nd Respondents. Thereafter, an amended petition dated 16th August 2021 was filed

to which the 1st and 2nd Respondent filed objections. This order pertains to these

objections to the amended petition.

The first objection is that the original petition should be dismissed in limine for non-

joinder of parties. It was submitted that the Petitioners should have made all the members

of the Cabinet Respondents to the application since a Cabinet decision had been taken on

the impugned Cabinet Memorandum [P10] by the time the original petition was filed.

The Petitioners have argued that the Cabinet decision was not published on the official

website of the Cabinet of Ministers. I am not inclined to support this objection in the

absence of a public source through which the Petitioners could have verified whether a

Cabinet decision had been made. The Petitioners sought to file an amended petition as

soon as the Cabinet decision was brought to their attention. I overrule the first objection.

The second objection is that both the original and amended petitions are time barred.

The impugned Cabinet Memorandum [P10] is dated 12th March 2021 whereas the original

petition was filed on 9th April 2021. Thus, the assail of the Cabinet Memorandum [P10] is

not time barred.

Admittedly the Cabinet decision was made on 15th March 2021, and the amended petition

was filed on 20th August 2021. The Petitioners allege that they became aware of the

Cabinet decision only when it was disclosed in open court on 20th July 2021. This court has

held that time starts to run from the point of time the Petitioners became aware of the

infringement or the imminent infringement [Siriwardena and Others v. Brigadier J.

Rodrigo and Others (1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 384; Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and Others (1988) 1

Sri.L.R. 384].

Nevertheless, in my view, the Cabinet decision itself is not the act which, as has been

alleged, would constitute an infringement of the fundamental rights of Petitioners. It is

only when the Attorney-General, if he chooses to do so, acts on the impugned Cabinet

decision that there may be, as alleged, an infringement of the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners.

This court has recognized the notion of a continuing violation of fundamental rights

[Wijesekera and Others v. Attorney-General (2007) 1 Sri.L.R. 38; Sugathapala Mendis and

Another v. Chandrika Kumaratunga and Others (Waters Edge case) (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 339;

Wijesekera and 14 Others v. Gamini Lokuge, Minister of Sports and Public Recreation and

20 Others (2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 329].

In my view, there are situations where imminent infringements are also continuing. As a

matter of fact, by definition, imminent infringements continue until a fundamental right

is violated or the decision-maker changes his or her mind. Hence until the Attorney-

General acts on the Cabinet decision or there is a change of mind of the Cabinet, the acts

impugned by the Petitioners are allegedly continuing imminent infringements of the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners. Accordingly, I conclude that the amended petition

is not time barred and overrule the second objection.

The third objection is that the amended petition has been filed to cure the defects in the

original petition which were brought to the notice of Court on behalf of the Respondents.

No doubt the Petitioners have included several new prayers in the amended petition. They

have also pleaded the Cabinet decision taken on the Cabinet Memorandum [P10] in

addition to making all the members of the Cabinet Respondents to the application.

Nonetheless, this is a fundamental rights application filed in the public interest. The

Petitioners allege that the impugned Cabinet Memorandum and decision are an attempt

at political interference of national legislation and violation /an imminent threat of

violation of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. It is further submitted that there

is a breach/imminent breach of the rule of law.

Whilst the Cabinet Memorandum sought approval of the Cabinet Ministers to withdraw

all cases where legal action is being taken at present and to hand over these animals to

their present owners according to the conditions of transferring these animals, the

Cabinet decision is to direct the Secretary, Ministry of Wildlife & Forest Conservation to

bring the special reasons adduced in the Memorandum to the notice of the Attorney

General and thereafter take necessary action in association with the Secretary, Ministry

of Public Security and in consultation with the Attorney General to reach an amicable

settlement with the relevant parties pertaining to the pending court cases, giving due

consideration to the proposal (4.2) in paragraph 4.0 of the Cabinet Memorandum.

In Attorney-General (on the relation of McWhirter) v. Independent Broadcasting Authority

[(1973) 1 All ER 689 at 697] Lord Denning succinctly described the role of the Attorney

General of England as follows:

“It is settled in our constitutional law that in matters which , concern the public at

large the Attorney-General is the guardian of the public interest. Although he is a

member of the government of the day, it is his duty to represent the public interest

with complete objectivity and detachment. He must act independently of any

external pressure from . whatever quarter it may come. As the guardian of the

public interest, the Attorney-General has a special duty in regard to the

enforcement of the law." [emphasis added]

Although there may be some differences in the two roles, these observations aptly apply

to the role of the Attorney-General of Sri Lanka. In fact, in Land Reform Commission v.

Grand Central Limited [(1981) 1 Sri.L.R. 250] this Court held that the Attorney-General has

a duty to the Court, to the State and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly

independent and to act impartially with the sole object of establishing the truth.

The Attorney-General is vested with extensive statutory powers in relation to criminal

investigations and prosecutions. Such powers are held in public trust. They must be

exercised for the due administration of justice according to the rule of law which is the

basis of our Constitution. Any type of dictation from whatever quarter will compromise

the independence of the Attorney-General unless such dictation is permitted by law. Any

compromise of the independence of the Attorney-General will have a negative impact on

the rule of law. The heart of the Petitioners' complaint is that the 1st and 2nd Respondents

and the Cabinet of Ministers are interfering with the statutory powers of the Attorney

General.

This is a serious allegation, which if true, has far reaching ramifications. According to

Article 4(d) of the Constitution, it is the bounden duty of this Court to secure and advance

the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. These are proceedings brought

on behalf of the public at large. I hold that this Court must not allow procedural defects

of the nature alleged in this matter to shackle its constitutional duty to examine the

allegation of the Petitioners at the leave to proceed stage. Accordingly, I overrule the third

objection.

I allow the amended petition dated 16th August 2021.
