Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kalutara

against the two Defendants seeking a declaration in the

prayer to the plaint that he has obtained a permanent

servitude to use the road described in the third schedule to

the plaint, ejectment of the Defendants from the encroached

area of this road, and damages.

As I will explain below, instead of stating he has obtained a

permanent servitude to use the road described in the third

schedule to the plaint, it would have been clearer had the

Plaintiff simply stated that he has the right to use the road

described in the third schedule to the plaint.

At the request of the Plaintiff, the District Court issued a

commission to depict the encroached portion of the said road.

4

Plan No. 717B produced in evidence as P1 through the Court

Commissioner shows the encroached portion marked Lot X.

After receipt of the said Plan and before filing the answer, the

Defendants also moved for a commission. In execution of this

commission, Plan No. 732 was received by Court. However,

the Defendants did not produce this Plan in evidence.

Having studied both Plans, the Defendants filed answer

stating that they have prescribed to the portion marked X in

Plan No. 717B and therefore the Plaintiffs action shall be

dismissed.

After trial, the District Court entered Judgment for the

Plaintiff except for damages.

On appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal, the High Court

set aside the Judgment of the District Court but did not say

the Defendants were entitled to their cross-claim of

prescriptive title over the encroached portion of the road.

Being dissatisfied with the Judgment of the High Court, the

Plaintiff preferred this appeal to this Court.

The High Court set aside the Judgment of the District Court

on the ground that the Plaintiff failed to identify the subject

matter in dispute:

[T]he Plaintiff has failed to show the exact width of the

road that was there before the encroachment and the

present width of the road that is existing now. Hence the

Plaintiff has totally failed to prove the width of the road

which should be depicted on the said roadway. Hence

5

the Plaintiff has failed to identify the subject matter in

dispute.

The identity of the subject matter was never in controversy

before the trial Court. There was no issue raised by the

Defendants to that effect. Before the District Court, the

subject matter in dispute was identified by both parties and

the Court as Lot X in Plan No. 717B.

The Plaintiffs position was that the said Lot X was a portion

of the road depicted as part of the western boundary of Lot 1

in the Final Partition Plan No. 2824 marked P3, whereas the

Defendants position was that they had prescribed to that

portion of the road.

Notwithstanding the Defendants appeal was allowed on the

said ground, the High Court also raised some concerns about

the presence of trees over 10 years of age and an electricity

post fixed to draw an electricity line to the Plaintiffs house in

the portion marked X in Plan No. 717B. The High Court

states that the Plaintiff did not explain how such old trees

came into being on this road if he had been using that road

over the years.

In my view, the presence of old trees within the encroached

area is beside the point. Let me explain.

The Plaintiff filed the partition action No. 4834/P in the

District Court of Kalutara to partition Lot Nos. 1C and 10 in

Partition Plan No. 934 marked P9 among the Plaintiff and

several Defendants. The Preliminary Plan No. 2693 marked

P6A and the Report marked P7 were prepared for the said

partition action. According to this Preliminary Plan and

Report, the disputed road in the instant action was part of

6

the corpus in the said partition action. This Plan and Report

further go to prove that a portion of this disputed road had

been encroached by the 1st Defendant in the instant action at

that time. The Court Commissioner had shown the

encroached portion as Lot C in the said Preliminary Plan.

However the 1st Defendant had not made an application to be

added as a party to that action, which he ought to have done

if he had a claim to that portion. The Final Partition Plan is

Plan No. 2824 marked P3 where the now disputed full road is

shown as part of the western boundary of Lot 1, which was

allotted according to the Final Decree dated 21.02.1984

marked P4 to the Plaintiff in the instant action. Hence, the

Plaintiff has every right to use this road as part of the subject

matter in that partition action. He does not need to show any

other right to use this road.

What the Court Commissioner did in the instant action was

to superimpose the said roadway in Plan No. 2824 on his

Plan No. 717B and show the existing encroachment. This is

similar to what the Court Commissioner in partition case No.

4834/P did when he prepared the Preliminary Plan No. 2693

marked P6A.

Admittedly, the Final Decree in partition case No. 4834/P

marked P4 was entered on 21.02.1984 and, according to her

own police statement marked P11, the 2nd Defendant in the

instant action put up a barbed wire fence enclosing the

encroached area on 25.04.1994.

It is irrelevant to give unwanted prominence or importance to

the ages of trees found on the encroached portion of the road.

The Court Commissioner carried out the survey in the instant

action in 1995. According to the Report, one tree is about 20

7

years old and the other about 15 years old. This means when

the Final Partition Decree P4 in partition case No. 4834 was

entered in 1984, the trees were already on that portion of the

road. The Defendants cannot say that they planted these

trees after the Final Decree P4 because the trees are much

older than 11 years. Nor can they claim any prescriptive

rights to that portion because the Final Decree P4 wiped out

all such rights, if they had any.

The electricity post, which has been fixed to draw an

electricity line to the Plaintiffs house is also within the

portion marked X in Plan No. 717B. The 2nd Defendant in her

evidence admits that the area the electricity post is fixed onto

belongs to the Plaintiff. Electricity posts are not fixed on

lands belonging to outsiders. They are fixed either on the

side of the road or on the customers land.

There is no evidence acceptable to Court that the Defendants

acquired prescriptive title to the encroached area marked X in

Plan No. 717B as required by section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Even the High Court did not come to such a

finding.

The High Court set aside the Judgment of the District Court

on the completely erroneous basis of non-identification of the

subject matter of the dispute.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the Judgment of

the High Court on the following questions of law:

Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law by:

(a) arriving at the finding that the Plaintiff has failed to

identify the subject matter of the action?

8

(b) arriving at the finding that the Plaintiff has not

established a right to the use of the said roadway

described in the third schedule to the plaint?

(c) setting aside the Judgment of the District Court dated

06.01.2005?

I answer all three of these questions in the affirmative.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court and restore the

Judgment of the District Court. The appeal is allowed with

costs payable by the Defendants to the Plaintiff in all three

Courts.
