Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ Three Fundamental Rights applications namely SC FR 131/2014, SC FR 132/2014 and SC FR

133/2014 were taken up together for argument. Grievance pleaded by the petitioners in these

three applications is common to all of them. Petitioners in all three cases agreed to abide by the

judgement in SC FR 132/2014, the matter that was taken up for argument before this Court.

Petitioners in all these three applications are police officers who were unsuccessful in securing

promotions to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police in the year 2014. All Petitioners had joined

regular force of Sri Lanka Police at different points of time and were in the rank of Inspector of

Police, at the time of filing these applications.

The 1st Respondent, who is the Inspector General of Police, called for applications for the

promotions to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police from the officers serving in the rank of

Inspector of Police by the order bearing No. D/MD/PRO/927/2013 (RTM 141) dated 4th

September 2013, a copy of which produced before this Court, marked as P2.

According to the said Order, applicants had to satisfy two factors to be eligible to apply for the

aforesaid promotion. Firstly they should have completed eight years of active service in the rank

of Inspector of Police by 25 September 2013 and confirmed in the service. Secondly, they should

posses an unblemished record of service for five years preceding 25 September 2013.

Petitioners in all three applications submitted their applications for the promotion, but were

unsuccessful. Two hundred and eighteen Inspectors of Police had been promoted through this

process as published through the order bearing No. D/MD/ADM/440/2014 dated 23rd April 2014

(TM 594) of the First Respondent, a copy of which is produced marked P8. Said promotions

were made with effect from 17 March 2014.

Respondents do not dispute the eligibility of the Petitioner to apply for the promotion described

hereinbefore. Furthermore it is conceded that the Petitioner in this application was in the 71st

position in the list of seniority, dated 15.11.2012. It is the contention of the Petitioner that his

right to equality was violated by denying the promotion to him while thirty-one applicants who

were positioned below the thousandth place in the seniority list, being promoted, over and above

him. It is his contention that the aforementioned thirty-one promotees (hereinafter referred to as

‘promotee-respondents’) had been favourably treated. It is his contention that these promotee-

respondents did not satisfy the basic requirement of eight years service in the rank of Inspector as

all of them were absorbed to the Regular Service in the police force with effect from 01 February

2006. The Petitioner contends that the thirty-one promotee-respondents should not have been

promoted as they have initially joined the reserve police service and have not completed 8 years

in active service as at 25th September 2013. They had been absorbed to the rank of Inspector of

Police in the Regular Force of the Police Department with effect from 01 February 2006 –

approximately seven years and eight months before the closing date of the applications namely

25 September 2013. Furthermore the petitioner contend that he had a legitimate expectation to be

promoted to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police through the process initiated in 2013 as he had

completed thirty years of service in the Police Department of which eleven years in the rank of

Inspector of Police and was positioned at the seventy first place in the list of seniority. It is his

contention that the denial of this promotion is irrational and arbitrary and therefore is violative of

the right guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Petitioner, therefore moves this Court to declare that Fundamental Rights guaranteed to him

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, had been infringed by the 1st Respondent. Furthermore,

the Petitioner initially sought an order quashing the promotions granted by the 1st Respondent by

his order bearing No. D/MD/ADM/440/2014 dated 23rd April 2014, marked as P8, and to declare

the said promotions are null and void. He was further seeking from this Court an order directing

the 1st Respondent to promote the Petitioner to the rank of Chief Inspector with effect from 17th

March 2014.

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

21

However it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner in this matter and the Petitioners in the two

other connected matters had been promoted to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police subsequent

to the institution of these proceedings before this Court. Therefore the Petitioners in all three

applications are now seeking an Order from this Court to back date the promotions to have effect

from 17th of March 2014, only. It is significant to note that 17th March 2014 is the date from

which the promotions were granted to the 218 successful candidates who applied in consequent

to the circular dated 4th September 2013. They contend that that the injustice caused to them in

2013-2014 could be satisfactorily remedied by an Order backdating the effective date of the

promotion to the same date on which the promotions were granted by the impugned Order /

Circular P8, issued by the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent contends, that rights of none of the Petitioners had been violated through the

promotions granted to two hundred and eighteen Inspectors of Police as per the Order dated 23

April 2014 (P8). He further contends that the petitioners had not been successful as they failed to

obtain marks above the cut off mark namely, 72.5. All two hundred and eighteen successful

candidates, including the thirty-one promotee-respondents (Inspectors of Police who were

absorbed to the Regular Police Force from the Reserve Force in 2006), have scored marks above

the cut-off mark; whereas the total marks obtained by the Petitioner had been 69. Therefore,

Respondents contend that none of the promotees had been favourably treated as against any of

the Petitioners but all applicants had been treated equally. A copy of the marks sheet of all the

candidates who applied to the post of Chief Inspector of Police was produced in these

proceedings marked 1R2.

A copy of the marking scheme for promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police (2013) was

produced marked P4. Marks under the said marking scheme is awarded out of 100, where 50

marks are allocated for the period of service and the remaining 50 marks are allocated for merit.

Candidates were to be awarded 05 marks for each complete year in the rank of Inspector of

Police and half of the marks allocated for each year of service, that is 2.5 marks, were to be

awarded for completing service for a period of 06 months or more and less than one year.

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

22

The basis for the Petitioner’s contention that the thirty-one promotee-respondents had been

treated favourably, is twofold. Firstly, it is his contention that those who were absorbed from the

Reserve Force in 2006 were not qualified to be considered for the promotion under consideration

as they have not completed ‘eight years of active service’ by the closing date of the applications

namely 25 September 2013. It is his contention that such officers had completed only seven

years and six months. Petitioner’s such calculation is on the basis that the period of service in the

Reserve Force should not be counted when calculating the period of ‘active service’ of such

officers. Secondly, he contends that the maximum marks that should have been awarded to such

officers was, 37.5 out of 50 marks allocated to the ‘period of service’. Furthermore, the petitioner

relies on the respective positions on which the Petitioners vis-à-vis the promotee-respondents

were placed in the list of seniority as at 15 November 2012. Petitioner was on the seventy first

position whereas the promotee-respondents were below the thousandth position in the said list.

Furthermore, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner relying on the judgment of this Court in

Tuan Ishan Raban and others v. Members of the Police Commission and Pradeep

Priyadarshana v. Members of the Police Commission and others (2007) 2 SLR 351

submitted that service in the Reserve Force should not be equated to the service in Regular

Force. In Tuan Ishan Raban and others (supra) petitioners challenged a provision in a circular

issued by the Senior DIG (Administration) on 21 October 2003, which required Sub Inspectors

in the Reserve Force to complete six years of service in the Regular Force for them to be

considered for the promotion to the rank of Inspector of Police. Petitioners in the said application

who were in the rank of Sub Inspector of Police and served in the Reserve Force had challenged

the aforementioned circular in 2003 on the basis that it is violative of the rights. Her ladyship

Justice Shirani Bandaranayake (as she then was) in the judgment dated 05.07.2006, held that the

said circular did not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

23

It was held,

“On a careful comparison of the characters of the Reserve Police Force and the Regular Police

Force, on the basis of the aforementioned analysis, it is evident that they belong to two different

categories without any rational nexus to link the two groups for the purpose of putting them

together.

In such circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the officers of the Regular Force and the

Reserve Force belong to two different categories and therefore the decision of the Respondents

to include Clause 2.1.III in the undated Circular P1 cannot be regarded as unequal, unfair,

arbitrary or violative of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1)

of the Constitution.” (at page 361) .

In arriving at this decision the court took into account various factors including the fact that the

Reserve Force and Regular Force are categorized separately under the Police Ordinance,

applicability of different requirements for recruitment and promotions in the two forces and

differences in the terms of employment in the two forces.

The learned Senior State Counsel contended that the facts and circumstances in Tuan Ishan

Raban and others (supra) can be distinguished from the facts and circumstances relating to the

applications under consideration. The petitioners in the present applications and all promotee-

respondents were in the Regular Force at the time they submitted their applications for

promotions, in 2013. These promotee-respondents had been absorbed to the Regular Force in

consequent to a cabinet decision based on a cabinet paper presented in the year 2006 which was

produced marked 1R3. The cabinet approval was sought to absorb all police officers in all ranks

in the Reserve Force to the Regular Force, who possess all qualifications necessary for

recruitment to the Regular Force. The Secretary Ministry of Defence by his letter dated 03

February 2006 had conveyed the Cabinet Decision to absorb “officers of the Reserve Police

Service into the Regular Police Service on condition that they have fulfilled all qualifications

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

24

required to be fulfilled when making recruitment to the Regular Police Service” (P6(a)). The

detailed Scheme of Absorption was issued by the Inspector General of Police and is produced

marked 1R4. One of the conditions on which the absorption had taken place is that “ the

reservists who are absorbed will be placed in their seniority just below their counterparts of the

Regular Cadre in the respective years in which they have been enlisted and also as per the date

on which they have been promoted to the respective ranks”. Furthermore the said scheme

required “all reservists recommended for absorption should be sent for further training”. The

learned Senior State Counsel further submitted that absorption process implemented in 2006 had

taken cognizance of the differences that existed between the Reserve Force and the Regular

Force and the reservists who were absorbed were placed on respective places in the seniority list

without any discrimination being caused to the officers who were in the Regular Force.

When all these factors are taken into account I am of the view that the ratio-decidendi in Thuan

Ishan Raban and others can be distinguished and hence cannot be directly applied to the facts

and circumstances of the matters under consideration. It is also pertinent to note that the position

in the list of seniority was not a factor that was recognised either in setting the criteria for

eligibility to apply for the promotion or a factor to assign extra marks for any applicant under the

marking scheme applicable to the impugned promotions. Marks were awarded for the period of

service (maximum of 50) and merit (maximum of 50). Therefore, the Petitioner’s contention that

the his rights were violated by granting promotions to the promotee-respondents who were below

1000th position in the seniority list is devoid of merit.

Furthermore, the eligibility criteria as per the notice dated 04 September 2013 (P2) is completion

of eight years active service in the rank of Inspector Police and being confirmed in the said rank.

The argument of the Petitioner that none of the promotee-respondents were eligible to apply is

on the premise that an applicant should have completed a period of eight years active service in

the rank of Inspector of Police in the Regular Police Service. It is the contention of the Petitioner

that active service mentioned in the said Circular refers only to active service in the Regular

Police Service.

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

25

It is pertinent to observe that the said Circular only specifies that a minimum of 8 years in active

service in the rank of Inspector of Police and it does not make a distinction between active

service in the regular force and the active service in the reserve force. It is my view, acceptance

of the submission of the Petitioners in this regard would amount to introducing an additional

criteria which was not stipulated in the circular. Court in my view should desist from taking such

a course. It is evident from document marked 1R6, that the said promotee-respondents had joined

the reserve force between 1988 and 1995 in the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police in the Reserve

Force. They were promoted to the rank of Inspector of Police in the Police Reserve Service

between 1998.04.16 and 2002.10.05. Therefore, they were in the rank of Inspector of Police in

the Reserve Police Service when they were absorbed into the Regular Police Service in 2006.

These promote-respondents have served an aggregate period between 10 to 14 years in the rank

of Inspector of Police as at the date specified in the circular (25.09.2013).

It is also pertinent to note that subsequent to the abovementioned absorption scheme, the

National Police Commission by a letter to the Inspector General of Police dated 07th August

2007, (a copy of which is marked as 1R5) had laid down the criteria to be followed in

determining the seniority of Police officers who were absorbed to the Regular Police Service.

The criteria stipulated in the said letter is reproduced as follows,

“

i. Seniority of officers in their respective ranks shall be determined from the date of

absorption; and they will be placed junior to all officers of the Regular Police

Service on that date.

ii. In the case of officers of the Reserve Police Service absorbed into the Regular

Police Service on the basis of 8 years active service, in lieu of possessing the

required educational qualifications, their seniority in the Regular Police Service

will be reckoned after deducting the 8 years active service from their total service.

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

26

iii. In the case of a Reserve Police personnel who had a number of breaks in his/her

service due to suspension, demobilization, his/her seniority shall be determined

according to period of his/her total active service.”

Furthermore, the said letter has confirmed,

“The Commission is in agreement with the Committee’s recommendations that in promoting

officers from rank to rank, the past service of the Reserve Police Officers be given due

recognition”.

The criteria set out by the Police Commission as described hereinbefore indicates that the

distinctions between the two categories of service were given due consideration all throughout

the process of absorption of Officers of the Reserve Service to the Regular Service. Furthermore,

it is nothing but fair to give due recognition to the past service of the Reserve Police Officers

when promotions from one rank to another is considered while placing them in positions below

the positions held by the officers in the Regular Force in the seniority list, at the time of

absorption.

Therefore, in my view giving due regard to the period of active service in the Reserve Force in

the rank of Inspector of Police in deciding whether an applicant had completed eight years of

active service in the rank of Inspector of Police is neither arbitrary nor irrational. I am unable to

hold in favour of the claim made by the petitioner in this regard namely that the period of active

service in the reserve force should not have been considered in calculating the period of active

service in the context of the eligibility to apply for promotions under consideration.

It is also important to observe that ‘each and every expectation’ cannot be treated as a ‘legitimate

expectation’ in the context of the exercise of rights of an individual. A rational, equal and fair

process is a factor sine-qua-non to ensure that a legitimate expectation of an individual to gain

SCFR 132/2014, SCFR 131/2014 & SCFR 133/2014

27

promotions to higher ranks in the course of employment, is protected and respected. It is not

only the petitioner but all other co-workers are entitled to entertain a legitimate expectation to be

promoted into higher ranks in the course of their service in the Police Force. Therefore

promotions granted to co-workers through a rational, equal and fair process could not lead to a

breach of a legitimate expectation of the Petitioner who failed to obtain more than the cut-off

mark prescribed through such promotion scheme.

For the foregoing reasons I am unable to hold that the impugned process through which

promotions to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police were granted by the Inspector General of

Police with effect from 17 March 2014 is unequal, unfair, arbitrary or violative of the Rights

guaranteed to the Petitioner under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Therefore I hold that the

Petitioners have failed to establish that his fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article

12(1) of the Constitution had been violated. Therefore the application is dismissed. I make no

order, as to costs.
