Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Galle

seeking to partition two contiguous allotments of land known as

Pinnaketiyawatta and Godaihalawatta as one unit. The 4th, 5th

and 7th defendants sought the dismissal of the partition action.

After trial, the District Court entered judgment as prayed for by

the plaintiff. The appeal filed by the 4th, 5th and 7th defendants

against the judgment of the District Court was dismissed by the

Court of Appeal. This appeal by the 4th defendant-appellant is

from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

This Court granted leave to appeal to the 4th defendant on the

following question of law:

7

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

Has the Court of Appeal erred in law by not coming to a

finding that the District Court of Galle has failed to

investigate the title in terms of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977

in particular not considering the deeds marked 4V1 to

4V10?

As stated above, the 4th defendant does not seek to partition the

land. He seeks the dismissal of the action. Hence his position

before this Court that the District Court did not take into

consideration his deeds marked 4VI to 4V10 in investigating the

title is irreconcilable with the relief sought.

The position of the 4th defendant before the District Court as

crystallised in the issues was not clear at all. His position before

this Court is no better.

The Preliminary Plan depicted five lots marked A to E as the

corpus. By way of issues 6 to 9, the 4th defendant took up the

position that lots A to C in the Preliminary Plan is the land

known as Pinkatiyawatte Dakunukebella alias Pinketiyawatte

Kosgahakebella, lot D is Godaihalawatta, and lot E is part of

Welikandewatte. It was not the position of the 4th defendant

before the District Court that lots A to D comprise the land to be

partitioned. Nor did the 4th defendant state that lots A to D are

parts of different lands unrelated to the land to be partitioned.

The 4th defendant did not take up a clear position in respect of

these lots.

By way of issue 10, the 4th defendant first states that lots A to C

are part of the corpus in another partition action No. P/9211

pending before the same District Court and therefore these lots

8

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

cannot be part of the corpus in the instant action. Thereafter, in

the same breath, by way of issues 11 to 19, he unfolds a

pedigree different from the plaintiffs in respect of lots A to C.

These are contradictory positions.

By way of issues 20 to 23, the 4th defendant reveals another

pedigree different from the plaintiffs for lot D.

Other issues raised pertain to lot E to which the 4th defendant

has no claim.

By the last two issues 27 and 28, the 4th defendant seeks

dismissal of the action in the event the aforesaid issues of the

4th defendant are answered in his favour.

Despite the 4th defendant seeking dismissal of the action, let me

now consider whether the 4th defendant proved his pedigree in

respect of lots A to D.

As seen from the proceedings dated 10.06.1997, it is correct that

at the trial the 4th defendant commenced his evidence in chief

and purported to mark the deeds 4V1 to 4V3 for the purpose of

record although these deeds were not before Court. The trial

was postponed in order for the 4th defendant to bring the deeds

and continue with his evidence in chief. However the 4th

defendant did not resume evidence on the next date and the 5th

defendant gave evidence instead. It is through the 5th defendant

that the deeds 4V1 to 4V10 were marked. In cross examination,

the 5th defendant categorically stated that he has no right to lots

A to D and his only claim is to lot E which is a minute portion of

about one perch. The 4th defendants purpose in marking the

9

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

deeds 4V1 to 4V10 through the 5th defendant is unclear as the

4th defendant did not specifically seek undivided rights to the

land. The 5th defendant concluded his evidence in chief seeking

dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

In the aforementioned circumstances, the learned District Judge

cannot be found fault with when he stated in the judgment that

the 4th defendant did not establish his rights to the land to be

partitioned.

During the course of the argument before this Court, learned

counsel for the 4th defendant was asked whether deeds 4V1 to

4V10 are relevant to the land to be partitioned but he did not

give a straightforward answer. When asked what share of the

land the 4th defendant claims on these deeds if they are relevant,

there was no answer at all.

Learned counsel attempted to make submissions on the failure

to identify the corpus on the strength of these deeds, stating

that the plaintiff filed this action to partition several lands in

violation of the partition law. However, as learned counsel for

the plaintiff rightly pointed out, the Supreme Court did not grant

leave to appeal on this question of law.

The only submission of learned counsel for the 4th defendant is

that the plaintiffs action shall be dismissed as there was no

proper investigation of title by the District Judge. He cites a

series of authorities to emphasise that it is the bounden duty of

the District Judge to independently investigate the title of each

party irrespective of what the parties or their attorneys submit

to Court.

10

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

It is true that under section 25(1) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of

1977, a special duty is cast upon the District Judge to

investigate the title of each party to the land to be partitioned.

But this does not mean that the District Judge shall go after the

parties pleading with them for help in investigating their title to

the land, more so when the parties are represented by attorneys.

An attorney is duty-bound to conduct the case so as to serve the

best interests of his client. When he conducts a trial, he has a

strategy in place, and rightly so. He raises points of contest,

marshals evidence, cross examines witnesses etc. according to

his plan. It is not proper for the Judge to sabotage this plan and

forcibly take control of the trial in the guise of investigating the

title to the land. Such conduct on the part of the Judge would

violate the most rudimentary norms of justice. The role of a

Judge hearing a partition case is no exception to this

fundamental norm.

In Thilagaratnam v. Athpuna [1996] 2 Sri LR 66 at 68

Anandacoomaraswamy J. stated:

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant cited several

authorities Goonaratne v. Bishop of Colombo 32 NLR 337,

Peris v. Perera 1 NLR 362, Neelakutty v. Alvar 20 NLR 372,

Cooray v. Wijesuriya 62 NLR 158, Juliana Hamine v. Don

Thomas 59 NLR 546 at 549 and Sheefa v. Colombo

Municipal Council 36 NLR 38 and stated that it is the duty

of the Court to examine and investigate title in a partition

action, because the judgement is a judgement in rem. We

are not unmindful of these authorities and the proposition

11

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

that it is the duty of the Court to investigate title in a

partition action, but the Court can do so only within the

limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence

both documentary and oral. Court cannot go on a voyage of

discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the

corpus for them, otherwise parties will tender their

pleadings and expect the Court to do their work and their

Attorneys-at-Laws work for them to get title to those shares

in the corpus.

A judgment entered in a partition action after following a long-

drawn-out cumbersome procedure shall not be set aside with a

stroke of the pen and retrial ordered causing enormous

difficulties, under the popular banner failure to investigate

title, unless there is good cause for doing so.

In Francis Wanigasekera v. Pathirana [1997] 3 Sri LR 231 at 234-

235, Weerasekera J. impressed upon the undesirability of the

literal application of section 25(1) of the Partition Law:

Learned Counsel also urged that the learned District Judge

failed to act in terms of section 25 of the Partition Act which

requires Court to examine and hear and receive evidence of

the title of each party as decided in the case of Sirimalie v.

Punchi Ukku 60 NLR 448.

I do agree that section 25 of the Partition Act requires the

Court to examine and hear and receive evidence of the title

and interest of each party. But it must be remembered that

the literal application of the provisions of this section would

12

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

lead to the most disturbing, hilarious and absurd result and

no partition case could ever be finally concluded.

John Singho v. Pedris Hamy (1947) 48 NLR 345 is a partition

case where the dispute presented to the District Judge was

whether Andiris Naide owned the land or whether Aberan owned

the land. The District Judge found on a balance of evidence that

Andiris Naide was the original owner. Having come to that

finding next he took upon himself to decide whether some of the

successors in title of Aberan had not acquired title by

prescriptive possession against all the other parties. Despite

this being a partition action, the Supreme Court decided that

the District Judge overstepped his boundaries. Wijeyewardene

J. held at 346:

This appears to have been a self-imposed task, considering

that the parties had told him that the dispute between them

was whether Andiris Naide or Aberan was the original

owner. It cannot be said that the plaintiff has not been

prejudiced by the action of the District Judge in deciding the

question of prescriptive possession in these circumstances.

A Judge may find it frequently very convenient to state, in

the form of issues, the matters in dispute between the

parties in a partition action. After satisfying himself that no

person other than the parties to the action has interests in

the property, he will in such a case decide the issues

framed by him and enter a decree for partition or sale

according to his finding on those issues. He should not in

such circumstances consider, without giving due notice to

the parties, any matters in dispute that may appear to him

13

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

to arise between them in the course of the proceedings. The

position, of course, will be different where the Judge does

not set down, in the form of issues, the matters in dispute

in a partition action. In such a case the parties will be

presumed to have asked the Court to adjudicate on all the

matters in dispute as disclosed by the pleadings.

I do not say that a partition trial shall be conducted in the same

manner as any other inter partes civil trial. Notwithstanding the

system of justice which prevails in our country is adversarial as

opposed to inquisitorial, the role of the Judge in a partition case

is different and unique. The responsibility of the Judge in a

partition case is much greater than in an ordinary civil trial,

particularly because collusive actions deprive the rights of the

true owners simply because partition actions are actions in rem.

Collusion can take place not only when right parties are not

before Court but also when they are before Court. The case of

Sirimalie v. Punchi Ukku (1958) 60 NLR 448 cited before

Weerasekera J. in Francis Wanigasekeras case (supra) provides

a typical example.

In Sirimalies case, the plaintiff in her plaint set apart shares of

the land to be partitioned to the 8th, 9th and 10th defendant-

petitioners. The trial was taken up when the plaintiff and the 7th

and 9th defendants were present. The only parties represented

by attorneys at the trial or at any previous stage were the

plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants. At the

commencement of the trial, the Court was informed that there

was no contest. When the evidence of the plaintiffs husband

was led, he deviated from what had been pleaded in the plaint

14

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

and took up a new position which deprived the 8th, 9th and 10th

defendant-petitioners of any share in the land.

The Supreme Court disapproved of the unsatisfactory manner in

which the trial was conducted and, having stressed the duty of

the District Judge in hearing a partition case, set aside the

judgment and directed that the trial be commenced afresh. At

page 450, Sansoni J. (later C.J.) stated:

I think the more serious objection to the manner in which

this trial was conducted is the fact that the 9th defendant,

who was present in Court, seems to have been totally

ignored. She appeared even before summons was served

on her. It is true that she filed no statement, but her

presence at the trial surely indicated that she had come to

watch her interests. She does not seem to have been asked

whether she accepted the new position taken up by parties

who had pleaded differently, nor whether she wished to

give evidence, or even to cross-examine the plaintiffs

husband whose evidence was directly against her

interests.

Obviously, the facts of Sirimalies case cried aloud for the

intervention of the Supreme Court to prevent what would

otherwise have been a miscarriage of justice.

Conversely, the facts of the instant action are totally different.

The 4th defendant was fully represented by an attorney

throughout the trial and the District Court answered the issues

with the available evidence.

15

SC/APPEAL/2/2019

If the 4th defendant later thinks his deeds marked 4V1 to 4V10

are relevant to the land to be partitioned, he can make an

application before the District Court to secure his undivided

rights from the share left unallotted by the District Judge in the

judgment.

I answer the question of law in the negative and dismiss the

appeal of the 4th defendant but without costs.
