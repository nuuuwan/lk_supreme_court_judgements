Introduction

Hettige Don Brampi Singho the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellant) preferred an appeal to this Court against the judgment

of the Civil Appellate High Court of Rathnapura which issued a Judgment in favour of

Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Dingiri Mahathmaya the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) and this court granted leave to appeal on

the question of law set out in paragraph 14 (a) of the Petition dated 5th December

2011.

The relevant question of law is reproduced for ease of reference

14(a) Have the Learned High Court Judges erred in holding that the

respondents have identified the subject land?

Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the Appellant reiterated that his

appeal is solely on non-identification of the corpus. Both learned Counsel made

comprehensive submissions and this Judgment has taken into consideration the

Petition, Affidavit, Written Submissions and all annexed materials.

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 17

It will be prudent to set out the facts of this case and in the process, it will be mandatory

to refer to the history (which is available in the brief) of this litigation.

Brief Facts

The deceased Respondent, Tennakone Mudiyansalage Dingiri Mahathmaya of

Sannasgama filed a plaint at the Court of Request of Ratnapura under the case number

C.R No. Class RET/20 No. 20256 to eject the deceased Appellant, Hettige Don Brampi

Singho and Dhanapala Arachchilage Carolis Appu. The case was settled and the terms

of settlement were duly filed on the 21st December 1927. The terms of settlement were

as follows:

1. Plaintiff be declared entitled to the land called Medawatta and the partly

tiled and thatched house standing there all.

2. The defendants to remain in the said house paying an annual rent of Rs. 3 to

the plaintiff for a period of 50 years.

3. Parties to bear their own costs.

Following this on the 10th February 1928 the Commissioner of Request entered

the Decree.

Further, a lease agreement was entered on the 30th November 1927 between

Tennakone Mudiyansalage Dingiri Mahathmaya (Deceased Respondent) and Hettige

Don Brampi Singho (Deceased Appellant) for a lease amount of Rs. 150/= covering a

period of 50 years. A Deed of Lease No. 12525 (hereinafter referred to as Deed of

Lease No. 12525) dated 30th November 1927 attested by D.P.S. Rajapakse was signed

by all parties and duly registered to effect this understanding.

Since Hettige Don Brampi Singho (Deceased Appellant) did not vacate the said

land and premises upon the expiration of the Deed of Lease No. 12525 in or around

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 17

30th November 1977, the deceased Respondent filed this present action to evict him

from the said property at the District Court of Ratnapura on the 8th March 1978.

Tennakone Mudiyansalage Dingiri Mahathmaya who was the original 1st

Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent died during the pendency of the action and was

substituted by Piyaseeli Podimenike Tennakoon who is the Substituted Plaintiff-

Appellant-Respondent. Further Hettige Don Brampi Singho who was the original

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant died during the pendency of the action and was

substituted by H. Dona Kamalawathie who is the Substituted Defendant-Respondent-

Appellant. It is also noteworthy that the Plaint was amended on the 12th May 1994. The

Appellant filed their answer on the 13th February 1980. The Learned District Court

Judge dismissed the plaint on the basis that the land is not properly identified.

The Respondents appealed against the said Order to the Civil Appellate High

Court. The Learned Judges decided that the District Judge has misunderstood the

nature of the case and therefore had misdirected himself in dismissing the case for

non-identification of the property. The Civil Appellate Judges entered a judgment in

favour of the Respondent.

The Appellant has invoked the jurisdiction of this court by way of a Petition

dated 5th December 2011 and this Court has granted leave to appeal on the above-

mentioned question of law. Since both Counsels made submissions on both

judgments, I have carefully perused the same.

Identity of the Corpus

In Mary Beatrice et al. v Seneviratne (1997) 1 SLR 197 Senanayake J took the

opportunity to quote the following passage from Maasdorp, Institutes of Cape Law 4th

Edition Volume 3 page 248;

A lessee as already stated is not entitled to dispute his landlords title and

consequently he cannot refuse to give up possession of the property at the

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 17

termination of his lease on the ground that he is himself the rightful owner

of the said property. His duty in such a case is first to restore the property

to the lessor and then litigate with him as to the ownership.

The above passage was accepted by the Supreme Court in the case of Bandara

v Piyasena 77 NLR 102.

Taking into consideration the above passage and the judgments in Bandara v

Piyasena (supra) and Mary Beatrice (supra) it could be seen that this is an action in

relation to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of contractual obligations arsing between

a lessor and lessee. Therefore, this is an action filed against a tenant holding over.

Hence a distinction can be made between a rei vindicatio action and an action against

a tenant holding over. [Vide Pathirana v Jayasundera 58 NLR 169 @ 173]

As per the sole question of law raised, it is pertinent to peruse the judgments

of the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court. I find the observations made

by the Judges of the Civil Appellate Court acceptable as the learned District Judge had

misidentified this case as a case of actio rei vindicatio. It could also be seen that the

learned District Judge had relied on the case of Peeris et al v Savunhamy 54 NLR

207 in arriving at his decision. Due to the importance placed by the District Court judge

on the case of Peeris v Savunhamy, it is essential that I take into consideration the

dictum of that judgement and its applicability to the present case.

The case of Peeris v Savunhamy dealt with two issues in its appeal. Firstly, it

dealt with the burden of proof upon the plaintiff to prove that he has a dominium and

secondly, the court dealt with the issue of whether the court could reverse the findings

of a trial judge if it was demonstrated that he had misjudged the facts. In that case the

plaintiff sought to vindicate title to an undivided share of a land. However, the plaintiff

had no title deeds for her share and based her entire claim on prescriptive possession.

The court held that in an action for declaration of title to land, where the defendant is

in possession of the land in dispute, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 17

dominium and further the courts went on to state that a finding of fact may be reversed

on appeal if the trial Judge has demonstrably misjudged the position.

In my view this case is not relevant to the facts in issue, as in the present case

the establishment of the dominium is not the issue but the identity of the corpus. It is

appropriate to take into consideration the observation made by Lord Halsbury in the

case Queen v Leathern (H.L.) 1901 at 495 with regard to the application of case

laws;

that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts

proved or assumed to be proved since the generality of the expressions

which may be found they are not intended to the expositions of the whole

law but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which

such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an

authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted

for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode

of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas

every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always, logical at all.

Following the decision in Peeris v Savunhamy many cases elaborated the

position with regard to the establishment of the identity of the corpus. In the case of

Seyed Mohamed et al. v Perera 58 NLR 246, Sinnetamby J in not following the

decision in the case of Peeris v Savunhamy was of the view that to identify the

premises in dispute in an action for declaration of title to immovable property, the

Court may take into consideration statements of boundaries in title deeds of adjoining

lands belonging to persons who are strangers to the action and who have not been

called to give evidence. The evidence of such title deeds may become inadmissible

only if objection to their production is taken in the court of first instance; they cannot

be objected to for the first time in appeal.

The Supreme Court in Ratnayake et al. v Kumarihamy et al. (2005) 1 SLR

303, in deciding whether the trial court had correctly identified the extent of the corpus

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 17

was of the opinion that both oral and documentary evidence could be considered to

identify a corpus on a balance of probability.

This shows that the established law or procedure in identifying the extent of a

corpus in a dispute takes into consideration statement of boundaries in title deeds of

not only the land in dispute but the adjoining lands even though they are strangers to

the action and both oral and documentary evidence is considered on a balance of

probabilities. As found in any rei vindicatio action, the burden of proof in an action

against a tenant holding over is on the plaintiff and they need to prove such an onus

on a balance of probability. [Vide Loku Menike et al. v Gunasekare (1997) 2 SLR

281]

Now I consider the judgment of the High Court, where the learned judges had

identified the issues, briefly set out their reasons and had come to their conclusions

stating that the said corpus is adequately identified.

In order to identify the corpus Medawatte we need to trace the point at which

both parties agree to the extent and identity of the corpus. This could be seen with

regard to the settlement agreement entered into at the Court of Requests of Ratnapura

on the 21st December 1927. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Request entered the

Decree on the 10th February 1928.

It is pertinent to reproduce the relevant portion of the decree where the corpus

is identified and explained.

Decree

This action coming on for final disposal before W. Samsons esqur

Commissioner of Requests, Ratnapura on the 10th Day of February

1928, in the presence of Messrs Attygala, Muttettuwegama, on the part

of the Plaintiff, and of Messrs Wijetilaka and Peeris, on the part of the

Defendants, it is ordered and decreed, that the Plaintiff be and the

same is hereby declared entitled to the land called Medawatta

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 17

situate at Sannasgama bounded on the North by

Digarolleidama, East by Palegampolagewatta, South by High

Road and West by Landewatta, containing in extent, 3 Seru

Kurakkan sowing and the part by titled and thatched house

thereon.

(Emphasis added)

It is also important to take into consideration the description of the corpus

provided in the Deed of Lease No. 12525 for clarity as all parties have signed that

agreement thereby agreeing on the identity of the corpus.

(Emphasis added)

English translation of the description mentioned above:

The said Lessor owned an allotment of Land with the land lease called

Medawaththa together with the tile and weed roofed house built by the

lessee standing thereon situated at the village of Sannasgama in the Uda

Pattu of Nawadun Korale in the District of Rathnapura Sabaragamuwa

Province and is bounded on the NORTH by Digarolel Land on the

EAST by Land claimed by Karolis Appu on the SOUTH by Main Road

and on the WEST by Landewaththa containing in extent of three (3)

Seru of Kurakkan

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 17

(Emphasis added)

This brings us to the present action filed in 1978 by the Respondent to evict the

Appellant upon the expiration of the Deed of Lease No. 12525 on the 30th November

1977. The schedule in the original plaint filed in 1978 described the property as follow:

:

(Emphasis added)

English Translation of the above schedule in the original plaint filed in 1978:

Presently, said land is depicted in Plan No. 1004 dated 12/07/1983 made

by M.S. Diyagama Licensed Surveyor together with the buildings

standing thereon and is bounded on the NORTH by Digarolla and

Pahala Liyedda on the EAST by Land claimed by Attygalle on the SOUTH

by Land claimed by Karolis Appu and Palugampala Village and on the

WEST by Rathnapura- Pelmadulla Main Road and Landewaththa

containing in extent of One Acre Two Roods Thirteen Perches (A1-

R2-P13) (0.6399 Hectares).

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 17

The appellant filed his answer dated 13th February 1980 and described the

property as follows:

, ,

,

,

.

English Translation of the above schedule in the Answer filed in 1980:

Allotment of Land called Medawaththa, Attygallewaththa and

Nawagamuwage Pahalawaththa alias Digarolla and an amalgamated

land together with the buildings and everything standing thereon

situated at Sannasgama Village in the Uda Pattu of Nawadun Korale in

the District of Rathnapura Sabaragamuwa Province and is bounded on

the NORTH by Pahala Liyedda and Pitakubura on the EAST by Land

claimed by Hendrik Appu and Paalugampala Deniya on the SOUTH by

Main Road and on the WEST by Landewaththa containing in extent of

Ten (10) Seru of Kurakkan

In the original answer the appellant took the position that the property

is a combined property and Weerasingha Haramanis Da Silva

Goonathilaka was entitled to 5/16 shares. Further the said Haramanis da

Silva Goonathilaka had sold this property and subsequently he is entitled

for undivided 5/192 shares.

It could be seen that from 1927 up until 1978 there has been no different

description of the corpus in issue. The description of the corpus is said to have been

changed after this case was filed.

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 17

It comes to my attention that there is a court proceeding at the District Court

of Ratnapura marked by the Appellant uner V4. The Appellant had instituted a land &

damage case against Dhanapala Arachchillage Joslin Nona and Walliwala Gamage

Gunasena. The case number was 8091 and the date of the plaint was 7th November

1968. In paragraph 2 of the plaint, it states as follows:

The person called Tennakone Mudiyansalage Dingiri Mahathmaya the

original owner of the land called and known as Madawatta situated at

Sannasgama within the jurisdiction of this court and more fully described

in the schedule hereto.

The schedule referred there is identical to the first case filed in 1927, and the

plaint in the present case. It is observed that one Mr. B.L. Abeyratne proctor had

appeared for the said Brampi Singho the Deceased Appellant who was a plaintiff in a

different case No. 8091 dated 7th November 1968 at the District Court of Ratnapura.

In the present case the answer and the amended answer states that one Mr. B.L.

Abeyratne had appeared for them (appellant). It is also observed that in the Civil

Appellate High Court in Ratnapura one Mr. B.L. Abeyratne appeared. This shows that

the Appellant themselves acknowledge the fact that the Respondents are the owners

of the corpus in dispute and they are in agreement with the identity of the corpus

Medawatte.

The above evidence the fact that the owner is the Respondent and the property

in dispute was the property stated in the schedule. Considering all, I find that the

findings of the learned High Court Judge is reasonable and supported by evidence as

envisaged in the judgment of Ratnayake v Kumarihamy. (supra) Therefore, I hold that

the corpus is properly identified.

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 17

Bona Fide Conduct

In the amended answer filed in the District Court dated 29th July 1994, in

paragraph 12 the appellant takes up a position that he was forced to sign the said

deed of lease No. 12525 (Which was executed on the 30th November 1927). This is the

first time that the appellant takes up a position that he was forced to sign the said

deed.

The circumstances of entering a lease agreement are sufficiently explained at

the beginning and it could be seen that from 1927 there has been no complaint made

to any relevant authorities of being forced to sign a deed.

Further the Appellant filed a case against Dhanapala Arachchilage Joslin Nona

and another at the District Court of Ratnapura under case number 8091, in the plaint

at paragraph 3 states as follows;

3. The plaintiff built a tiled house on the land and the said

Dingirimahatmaya by and upon deed of lease No. 12525 dated 30th

November 1927 gave a lease of the said land to the said plaintiff for

a period of fifty years form 30th November 1927.

(sic)

This shows that such a position was raised by the Appellant to mislead the

courts and to get a favourable decision. Such a position taken by the Appellant and

later not pursued is disrespectable to the judicial system and it is supported by two

Maxims of Equity.

Firstly, we can consider this issue under the maxim of he who comes in to equity

must come with clean hands.

It is an established fact that if a person who approaches the court must come

with clean hands and put forward all the material facts otherwise, he shall be guilty of

misleading the court and his application or petition may be dismissed at the threshold.

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 17

If an applicant makes false statement and/or suppresses material facts or attempts to

mislead the court, the court may dismiss action on that ground alone.

In Har Narain v Badri Das [1964] 2 S.C.R. 203, Gajendragadkar J. speaking for

the Court observed:

"It is of utmost importance that in making material statements and

setting forth grounds in applications for special leave, care must be

taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue

or misleading."

In that case the Court revoked the leave granted because the appellant had

made certain inaccurate and misleading statements in his petition for leave to appeal

to the Indian Supreme Court.

He who comes into equity must come with clean hands. A court of equity will

refuse relief to a plaintiff whose conduct in regard to the subject matter of the litigation

has been improper. [Vide Arunima Baruah v Union of India [2007] 6 SCC 120]

As discussed earlier it is observed that the appellants had not acted in good

faith. Further they tried to mislead the court through their amended answers stating

that the said lease was signed by force. This court will not tolerate any person who is

misleading the judicial system and it should be seriously noted and dealt with. As such

this court is empowered to dismiss this application in limine and order cost as way of

penalty.

Secondly, we can consider this issue under the maxim of suppressio veri et

suggestio falsi (suppression of truth and suggestion of falsehood).

This is a fairly new maxim of equity. It has developed to form as a rule of law.

Suppressio veri and/or suggestio falsi means that when with respect to a material fact

of the case, either suppression of truth or suggestion of a false statement is proven,

then the injured party can seek relief. Both of these are considered to be equally wrong.

In this situation it is important to consider the case of Regina v Lucas (1981) 2 All ER

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 17

1008 which advances the proposition that a lie, if established, would corroborate the

story of the opponents. Following this decision Atukorale, J in Karunanayake v

Karunasiri Perera (1986) 2 Sri L.R 27 (with Sharvananda, C.J and Colin-Thome, J

agreeing) expressed the view that principle envisaged in the Lucas case applies equally

to civil cases as it would to criminal cases.

In this situation it could be seen that the Appellants have suggested a false

position thereby falling within the maxim of suggestio falsi. The courts in similar

jurisdictions such as India, in the case of K.K. Anathan Pillai v State of Kerala (1968)

AIR Ker 234, during an ex parte proceeding, the party that had appeared, did not

disclose the complete material facts in order to get a stay order in their favour. Later,

when the Court discovered this, it was held that such a stay order issued on untrue

facts would be deemed invalid. In another Indian case Nand Lal v State of Jammu &

Kashmir (1960) AIR JK 19, it was held that when the relevant facts of the case are not

correctly and precisely mentioned in the petition, then by application of this maxim,

the writ petition will be dismissed, without going into the merits of the case.

As stated earlier it is the view of this court not to tolerate any person who is

misleading the judicial system and it should be seriously noted and dealt with. Through

the application of such a maxim a false suggestion such as in this case could lead to

dismissal of this petition of the Appellant.

In applying both these maxims of equity in the present scenario it could be seen

that the Appellant by making a false statement has invited the courts to dismiss this

application and order costs. I am of the view that a cost should be imposed upon the

Appellant for disrespecting the judicial system and damages must be awarded to the

Respondent.

SC Appeal 145/2013 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 17

Summary

Considering all the above matters, I dismiss this appeal with costs. Respondents

are also entitled to recover the costs in both the District Court and the High Courts. In

view of the conclusions reached, I answer the above questions of law in the negative.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
