JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC, J.,

The present appeal seeks to challenge the judgment of the High Court by which,

the learned High Court Judge had affirmed the Labour Tribunal’s findings that the

termination of services of the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the ‘Applicant’) was unjust and therefore the Applicant was entitled

to compensation.

The Applicant, in his application made to the Labour Tribunal had averred that he

had been employed as the ‘Manager-Packing’ of the Respondent-Appellant-

Petitioner Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the ‘Appellant-

Company’) since 25th March 2003 and had alleged that when he reported to work

on 3rd April 2008, he was served with a letter of suspension from service (‘j2’). He

had been told that a domestic inquiry would be held on 8th April 2008 regarding

4

the same. A domestic inquiry, however, had not been held as intimated, and the

Applicant’s services had been terminated by letter dated 22nd April 2008 (‘j3’).

The reason given for the dismissal of the Applicant had been, his failure to ensure

that the polybags used for packing the garments ordered by an international buyer,

‘Next’ were in compliance with the specifications and other requirements

stipulated by the said international buyer [‘Next’] and another buyer ‘Regatta’ and

that the Applicant failed to carry out his duties up to their expectations. The

Applicant on the other hand claimed, that the termination of his services without

holding a domestic inquiry amounts to unjust and unfair termination of services.

The Appellant-Company in its answer to the Labour Tribunal stated inter alia that

the Applicant as the ‘Manager-Packing’, was entrusted with the vital responsibility

of packing finished garments according to the buyer’s specifications ensuring the

degree of quality required. Their position was that, if the ‘Manager-Packing’ fails

to carry out the packing as required, it would result in a loss of business, financial

loss and loss of valuable clients and / or buyers in the context of the highly

competitive garment manufacturing industry, in addition to the risk of the buyers

rejecting the said orders and possible discontinuation of procuring garments from

the Appellant-Company.

The Appellant-Company had called as witnesses the Human Resources Manager

G. G. Samarasekera and Packing Officer K. N. Wijeratne of the factory. In the

course of their evidence, they had mainly explained the adverse consequences of

the Packing Manager failing to meet the specifications of the buyer. The documents

marked ‘j4’ and ‘j5’ had been submitted to demonstrate that two international

buyers, ‘Regatta’ and ‘Next’ had complained about the deviation from the

procedures of loading the cartons of finished garments into the containers. The

Applicant had been warned previously by ‘j1’ (dated 29th September 2009), not to

deviate from the rules and procedures that are required to be adhered to, when

packing the relevant orders.

5

The Labour Tribunal had held that the termination of the Applicant was wrongful

and ordered the Appellant-Company to pay Rs.420,000/- as compensation, to the

Applicant (at page 181-187 of the Appeal brief). On appeal to the Provincial High

Court by the Appellant-Company, the Learned High Court Judge had affirmed the

award of the Labour Tribunal, by its judgment dated 12th December 2013 (‘P1’).

The Appellant-Company sought Leave to Appeal, and this Court granted leave on

the following questions of law, referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (c) and (i) of

paragraph 10 of the Petition of the Appellant;

(a) Did the High Court misinterpret and misapply the established legal

principles and/or decided case law submitted on behalf of the Petitioner in

arriving at the Conclusion of ‘P1’ [judgement of the High Court]?

(c)) Did the High Court fail to evaluate the evidence establishing the grave

negligence of the Respondent and that the Respondent had been previously

warned as to his negligence pertaining to the packing function?

(i) Did the High Court err by holding that a domestic inquiry is mandatory

under the established legal principles of Sri Lanka?

Order of the Labour Tribunal

The Labour Tribunal had decided that the termination was unjust, based on several

factors. Witness K. Wijeratne, Packing Officer, had stated that the responsibility of

ensuring that the packing was done to meet the buyer’s specifications rested

entirely with the Manager-Packing, i. e. the Applicant, and that a loss would result

to the Company if the Manager-packing failed to carry out the packing according

to the given specifications. The witness had admitted that the Applicant held a

position senior to him in the company hierarchy. The President of the Labour

Tribunal, having considered the testimony of this witness, had been of the opinion

that his evidence had no direct connection to the main issues of the case i.e. proving

6

the allegation against the Applicant, as the witness had given evidence only

relating to the possible consequences of the Manager-Packing failing to meet a

buyer’s specifications. G. G. Samarasekera, the other witness who testified on

behalf of the Appellant-Company, had been employed by the company about one

and half years after the Applicant’s services had been terminated and it had

transpired in the course of his evidence that, he had had no personal knowledge

of the orders in question. Furthermore, the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal had observed that the witness had admitted that a domestic inquiry had

not been held, although it was stated in ‘j2’ that a disciplinary inquiry would be

held regarding the Applicant on 08th April 2008.

The two emails, on the strength of the contents of which the Applicant’s services

had been terminated, purported to have been sent by ‘Next’ and ‘Regatta’ had been

submitted by the witness as evidence subject to proof, on 16th October 2009 (‘j4’

and ‘j5’). The learned President of the Labour Tribunal, however, had observed

that even after a lapse of ten months, the Appellant-Company had failed to call

Jude Virajith, the Manager of the Appellant-Company as a witness, who is said to

have received the two emails from the buyers. This court is mindful of the fact that

the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance have no application to proceedings

before the Labour Tribunal. In the instant case, however, there was a duty on the

Appellant-Company to establish a nexus between the impugned emails and the

incident over which the services of the Applicant were terminated. As such this

court cannot find fault with the learned President of the Labour Tribunal when he

held that the Appellant-Company had failed to establish their position sufficiently

with evidence

The Applicant, in his evidence, had accepted that the ‘polybags’ they manufactured

had been longer than what was specified by ‘Next’. However, he had maintained

that the sample of the bags sent to ‘Next’ had been approved and the emails with

the specifications sent by ‘Next’ had been submitted marked ‘A4’. The Applicant

had also maintained that the measurements of the bags would be checked by the

7

Quality Controller of the Stores Section and after packing would also be checked

by the ordering agency before being shipped. The learned President of the Labour

Tribunal had been of the opinion that this evidence given by the Applicant had

neither been challenged nor contradicted by the Appellant-Company, thereby

failing to justify the allegations on which the Applicant’s services had been

terminated.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal had deemed it fit that the Applicant

be paid compensation in terms of Sections 33(5) and 33(6) of the Industrial

Disputes Act in lieu of reinstatement. Following Associated Newspapers of Ceylon

Ltd. v. Jayasinghe 1982 2 SLR 595 where it was held that “the essential question,

in the determination of compensation for unfair dismissal is- what is the actual

financial loss caused by the unfair dismissal, for compensation is an ‘indemnity for

loss’. In the present case the President of the Labour Tribunal had been of the view

that the Applicant should be paid the equivalent of 3 months’ salary for each year

of service with the Petitioner company.

Judgment of the Provincial High Court

The Learned Judge of the Provincial High Court has stated that the Appellant-

Company had not demonstrated to court whether the international buyer, ‘Next’

rejected the garments or refused payment for the garments, and the amount of the

loss, if any, caused to the Appellant-Company. The Learned Judge had made the

same observations made by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal that the

Human Resource Manager called as a witness had no knowledge about the incident

as he had joined the Company after the Applicant’s services had been terminated,

that the other witness held a position junior to that of the Applicant and had not

given evidence of any value, and that the Manager, Jude Virajith, had not been

called as a witness regarding the emails (‘j4’ and ‘j5’) received by him from the

international buyers.

8

Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge had noted that the evidence given by

the Applicant reveals that the Appellant-Company had taken on the particular

order in issue, although it did not have the necessary equipment to pack the

garments according to the buyer’s specifications at their Factory in Marawila.

When the Applicant and the Quality Manager had informed the management of

the Appellant-Company that the required quality could not be achieved at their

Factory, they had been directed to stitch the garments at the Marawila factory and

to get them packed at the Avissawella Factory, as this was a special order which

they could not afford to lose. The samples that were packed in Avissawella had

been submitted to the Central Quality Controlling Institute for ‘Next’ and the

approval obtained to proceed with manufacturing the order. After the order had

been shipped, however, the Applicant had been informed by the Audit Officer that

‘Next’ had complained that the polybags used were too long. Thereafter the

Applicant’s services had been terminated.

The evidence given by the Applicant regarding the order, alleging that the

Appellant-Company had taken on an order that they were ill equipped to produce

and relied on the Applicant to somehow ensure that the order was produced, had

not been challenged by the Appellant-Company. The Learned High Court Judge

had formed the view that the Applicant had been made the ‘scapegoat’ for the

decision of the higher management of the Appellant-Company in accepting an

order that they were ill equipped to manufacture.

Referring to the principles of natural justice, the Learned High Court Judge had

further deemed the conduct of the Appellant-Company, in informing the Applicant

that a disciplinary inquiry would be held and then dismissing him without holding

the said inquiry, was contrary to the principle that “no one should be condemned

unheard.”

Although the Learned High Court Judge was in agreement with the Appellant-

Company’s submission that the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance are not

9

applicable to industrial disputes before a Labour Tribunal, she had held that

whereas ‘j4’ and ‘j5’ had been submitted subject to proof, evidence should have

been adduced to prove the same. The Appellant-Company’s submission that the

compensation due to the Applicant had not been calculated correctly was

dismissed on the basis that there was no need for such a calculation as evidence

had been led on the loss that was caused to the Applicant by the termination of his

services and that it had not been challenged.

Questions of Law

Question (a) : Misinterpretation and misapplication of established legal principles

I shall deal with the above question under 2 sub-headings; (a)(i) and (a)(ii).

(a) i. Computation of compensation

Whether the compensation was granted in the accepted manner and whether the

standard of proof adopted by the High Court was correct are the main questions

that have to be answered in making a finding in relation to the first question of

law on which leave to appeal was granted, i.e. whether the High Court

misinterpreted and misapplied the established legal principles and / or decided

case law, submitted on behalf of the Appellant-Company.

The Appellant-Company in its written submissions has taken up the position that

the Labour Tribunal has made no reference to the manner in which the

compensation was calculated. The High Court on the other hand had been of the

opinion that it was not so and had upheld the amount of compensation that had

been awarded by the Labour Tribunal.

In Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation 1995 2 SLR 379, the very

case relied on by the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal to state that it is the

‘actual financial loss’ that should be considered, Justice A. R. B. Amerasinghe has

commented at length on the manner in which the amount of compensation should

10

be calculated. “In determining compensation what is expected is that after a

weighing together of the evidence and probabilities in the case, the Tribunal must

form an opinion of the nature and extent of the loss, arriving in the end at an

amount that a sensible person would not regard as mean or extravagant but would

rather consider to be just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case. There

must eventually be an even balance of which the scales of justice are meant to

remind us.

While the expressed loss, in global terms of years of salary may in certain cases

coincide with losses reckoned and counted and settled by reference to the relevant

heads and principles of determining compensation, it is preferable to have a

computation which is expressly shown to relate to specific heads and items of loss.

It is not satisfactory to simply say that a certain amount is just and equitable. There

must be a stated basis for the computation taking the award beyond the realm of

mere assurance of fairness. For a just and equitable verdict the reasons must be set

out in order to enable the parties to appreciate how just and equitable the verdict

is. Where no basis for the compensation awarded is given, the order is liable to be

set aside.” (emphasis added)

In short, the court had been of the opinion that the Labour Tribunal must evaluate

the evidence before it, to form an opinion as to the amount that could be said to be

just and equitable compensation and the award is to be computed on the basis of

specific heads or items of loss so that the order would not be open to challenge on

the ground that it is arbitrary or without a sound rationale.

With due deference, when considering the award of the Labour Tribunal, it has to

be noted that, although it was stated that the actual financial loss should be

considered when awarding compensation, the Learned President of the Labour

Tribunal has not elaborated how the actual loss was computed in this case. The

Learned High Court Judge, at page 12 of the judgment, had expressed the view

that, as evidence of the Applicant had been led regarding the loss that was caused

11

to him due to the loss of employment, there was no necessity to calculate the loss

caused separately. However, that does not seem to be a sound view, as formulas

and guidelines for computing the losses of a wrongfully terminated employee has

been set by numerous judicial precedents in an attempt to introduce some degree

of uniformity into the process. A plethora of factors such as whether the applicant

obtained fresh employment, the period for which the applicant remained

unemployed, the loss of retirement benefits has to be considered depending on the

particular circumstances of each case. Furthermore, not only should those factors

be relied on, but they should be explicitly stated in the judgment as having been

relied upon in forming the judgment.

Observing that the Legislature has left in the hands of the Labour Tribunal, the

discretion of determining the quantum of compensation on the basis of facts and

circumstances of each case, Wijetunga J. in Up Country Distributors (Pvt) Ltd., v.

Subasinghe [1996] 2 SLR 330 (at page 335) observed that “…some degree of

flexibility in that regard is both desirable and necessary if a tribunal is to make a

just and equitable order.” The case involved a situation where a workman prayed

for reinstatement with back wages or compensation in lieu of reinstatement, and

compensation was ordered taking into consideration, in particular, the workman's

period of unemployment, his age at termination and the period of his service. In

the case referred to, the High Court had been of the opinion that the Labour

Tribunal had given due consideration to the authorities cited and the Supreme

Court held that therefore it would be idle to contend that the basis for the award

of compensation was not given. The Supreme Court however, emphasized that “the

tribunal should have dealt with the criteria relevant to the computation of

compensation in more explicit terms, thus "taking the award beyond the realm of

mere assurance of fairness" ‑per Amerasinghe, J. in Jayasuriya's case (supra).”

(emphasis added).

It has been submitted on behalf of the Appellant-Company that although

compensation has been ordered by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal on

12

the concept of ‘immediate loss’ it ought to have been decided upon two questions,

namely, 1. Did the worker obtain employment after the unjust termination, 2. How

many months was the worker out of employment? (mitigation of losses). On the

other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that, as upheld in Coats

Thread Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. v. Samarasundara 2010 (2) SLR 1 (at page 11) that if a

workman is suspended pending a domestic inquiry he is entitled to his monthly

salary, and that the workman has earned an income otherwise, does not vitiate the

entitlement to receive the salary from the employer who has suspended his

services. In the present case a domestic inquiry has not been held although the

Applicant was informed that a domestic inquiry would be held.

Further, on behalf of the Appellant-Company it has been pointed out that the facts

necessary for computing the compensation due to the Applicant were not

submitted to the Labour Tribunal by the Applicant. The case of The Ceylon

Transport Board v. Wijeratne 77 NLR 481 was referred to, where a comprehensive

list of factors that the Labour Tribunal may consider in awarding compensation

were recognized by the court; “In making an order for the payment of

compensation to a workman in lieu of an order for reinstatement under section 33

(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, a Labour Tribunal should take into account such

circumstances as the nature of the employer's business and his capacity to pay, the

employee's age, the nature of his employment, length of service, seniority, present

salary, future prospects, opportunities for obtaining similar alternative

employment, his past conduct, the circumstances and the manner of the dismissal

including the nature of the charge levelled against the workman, the extent to

which the employee's actions were blameworthy and the effect of the dismissal on

future pension rights. Account should also be taken of any sums paid or actually

earned or which should also have been earned since the dismissal took place.”

As cited with approval in The Ceylon Transport Board v. Wijeratne 77 NLR 481,

Weeramantry J. in the case The Ceylon Transport Board v. Gunasinghe 72 NLR 76

at page 83 has emphasized the importance of true facts in making a just and

13

equitable order as to compensation; “Proper findings of fact are a necessary basis

for the exercise by Labour Tribunals of that wide jurisdiction given to them by

statute of making such orders as they consider to be just and equitable. Where

there is no such proper finding of fact the order that ensues would not be one

which is just and equitable upon the evidence placed before the Tribunal, for

justice and equity cannot be administered in a particular case apart from its own

particular facts.”

Apart from the evidence of the Applicant led at the Labour Tribunal where the

Applicant stated his period of employment with the Appellant-Company, his salary

and age and that he has one daughter, that she was due to be born at the time his

services were terminated, that she is two and half years at the time of giving

evidence, and that his wife is unemployed (pages 98-99 of the Appeal brief) no

other facts were adduced to aid the Labour Tribunal in making a decision as to

compensation. In Jayasuriya (supra) the Supreme Court stipulated that “The

burden is on the employee to adduce sufficient evidence to enable the Tribunal to

decide the loss.”

The courts have upheld the expectation that a tribunal would specify in detail, to

the extent possible, the specific heads on which the compensation was computed

and, that the burden of adducing evidence to enable the court to compute the loss

in such a meticulous manner is with the employee whose services have been

terminated. As the employee in this case has starved the Labour Tribunal of the

information necessary to make a well laid out computation, the Tribunal cannot

be faulted for failing to set out the specificities. Furthermore, based on the details

provided to the Labour Tribunal, it cannot be said that the computation of

compensation is totally disproportionate to the alleged loss, and we do not wish to

disturb the order of the Labour Tribunal as to the amount of compensation.

14

(a) ii. The applicable burden of proof and standard of proof

The Industrial Disputes Act does not state on whom the burden of proof should lie

in a labour matter before the labour tribunals or courts. The Appellant-Company

argued that the burden of proof applicable here is the burden referred to in Section

101 of the Evidence Ordinance, i.e. a party must bear the burden of establishing

the facts on which he relies for the remedy he seeks. Thus, the Appellant-company

argues that the burden of proving that the Applicant was wrongfully terminated

would be recumbent on the Applicant himself.

Regarding the standard of proof in labour matters, courts have taken the stance

that the balance of probability is the standard commensurate with ensuring that

labour relations are not sabotaged by the adjudication. In Piyasena Silva v. Ceylon

Fisheries Corporation (1994) 2 Sri LR 292 it was recognized that the standard of

proof in labour matters is the balance of probability. In Associated Battery

Manufacturers (Ceylon) Ltd. 77 NLR 541 the reason for adopting a balance of

probability was explained (at page 553) “The whole object of labour adjudication

is that of balancing the several interests involved, that of the worker in job security,

since loss of his job may mean loss of his and his family’s livelihood; that of the

employer in retaining authority over matters affecting the efficient operations of

the undertaking; that of the community in maintaining peaceful labour relations

and avoiding unnecessary dislocations due either to unemployment or

unproductive economic units. Each is equally important. None of these objectives

can be achieved by the adoption of the standard of proof required in criminal cases

in the determination of the facts which have to be established before a Labour

Tribunal before it can exercise its jurisdiction to make an order which in all the

circumstances of the case is just and equitable.” (emphasis added). A similar view

was expressed in The Batticaloa Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies Union Ltd. v.

Velupillai 71 NLR 60 “in proceedings before labour tribunals the strict degree of

proof as in a Court of law is not required...”.

15

The law relating to the burden of proof in labour matters has developed by way of

judicial precedent which has stated that; “The burden is on the employer to justify

the termination on the principle that ‘he who alters the status quo and not he who

demands its restoration, must explain the reasons for such alteration.”

(Vide S. R. De Silva, The Legal Framework of Industrial Relations in Ceylon, at page

570-571). The case of Gunasekara v. Latiff [1999] 1 SLR 365 where it was held by

the Court of Appeal that “While S. 101 Evidence Ordinance is concerned with the

duty to prove a case as a whole, viz the overall burden of proof S. 103 regulates

the burden of proof as to a particular fact, however the devolution of the overall

burden is governed by S. 102 which declares that the burden of proof lies on that

person who would fail if no such evidence at all were given on either side.” was

quoted in support of this stance. The case of Gunasekara v. Latiff involved a

Declaration of Title, where the questions of who should begin the case, and on

whom the burden of proof lies was commented on. However, before the Labour

Tribunal, the Appellant-Company has argued that the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance do not apply to cases at the Labour Tribunal, a view which was

endorsed by the High Court as well. It seems to be a contradictory position adopted

by the Appellant.

In the written submissions filed before the Labour Tribunal on behalf of the

Applicant, it has been argued that per Section 5(c) of the Evidence Special

Provisions Act No. 14 of 1995 and Section 104 of the Evidence Ordinance, the

burden of proving the emails is on the Appellant-Company. On the other hand, in

the written submissions on behalf of the Appellant-company, it has been submitted

that as the Applicant has admitted the fact, that he received the email ‘j5’ sent by

Kelum Warnapatabendi, Senior Product Technologist for ‘Next’ in Sri Lanka (at

page 11 in the evidence given on 9th February 2011) there is no necessity for it to

be proved by the Appellant-Company. Nevertheless, the opinion of the Learned

High Court judge in this regard, that if the emails ‘j4’ and ‘j5’ were submitted

16

subject to proof then evidence should be called to prove the same, is the sound

approach.

The High Court had been of the opinion that the evidence given by witness K. N.

Wijeratne cannot be attached any value in deciding whether the Applicant was in

fact guilty of the conduct which led to his termination. This was due to the concern

that the witness held a position subordinate to the Applicant and would not be

sufficiently knowledgeable about the job duties of the Applicant to be in a position

to comment on the Applicant’s performance in meeting the responsibilities of the

Applicant’s position as Packing Manager. However, it is more probable that the

witness as a Packing Officer with many years of experience would have come to

know the job duties of a Packing Manager from working with and under the

instructions of the Packing Manager.

Considering the above I am of the opinion that the High Court has neither

misinterpreted nor misapplied established legal principles or decided case law and

thus answer the Question of law referred to in subparagraph (a) in the negative.

Question (i)

Now I turn to Question (i) “Did the High Court err by holding that a domestic

inquiry is mandatory under the established legal principles of Sri Lanka?” and then

to Question (c) Did the High Court fail to evaluate the evidence establishing

negligence on the part of the Applicant, as some factual observations are common

to both.

In the Sri Lankan Labour Law regime, there is no statutory requirement to conduct

a domestic inquiry prior to the termination of a workman. Where there is no

collective agreement or a clause in the contract of employment that a domestic

inquiry should be held in the event of termination, it is not mandatory to hold a

17

domestic inquiry. However, it has come to be recognized that holding a domestic

inquiry could be beneficial to both the employer and the employee.

There may be instances where it is plain that the employee in question is guilty of

a conduct that warrants termination and could be dismissed without any need for

further investigations. Therefore, it would be an additional burden to require

employers to hold domestic inquiries by default in all instances.

Holding a domestic inquiry is however a salutary practice. S. R. De Silva in ‘Law of

Dismissal’ [The Employers’ Federation of Ceylon, Monograph No. 8, Revised

Edition 2004] commenting on the desirability of holding domestic inquiries states

“Punishment of an employee, whether by dismissal or otherwise, without

following a disciplinary procedure which involves the giving of an opportunity to

an accused employee to exculpate himself is, prima facie, arbitrary. Many labour

courts today may view disciplinary action without a show cause letter followed by

an inquiry, where necessary, as being arbitrary, since such action must be assumed

to be taken without the employer having satisfied himself about the guilt or

otherwise of the accused employee.” Listing several reasons for the desirability of

holding a domestic inquiry, S. R. De Silva has advanced the view that even where

guilt can be established without a domestic inquiry, holding a domestic inquiry

could be beneficial (vide paragraph 41).

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers’ Union v. Weerakoon Bros Ltd.

[Sri Lanka Gazette No. 90 of 14. 12. 73] the court accepted that the dismissal of

employees without holding a domestic inquiry could be reviewed for correctness

as it was against the principles of natural justice. As there were no allegations of

mala fide against the employer, in All Ceylon National Milk Board Trade Union v.

The Board of Directors, CWE [Gazette No. 261/10 of 07. 09. 1983] the absence of

a domestic inquiry was not considered to be an issue regarding the justification of

the dismissal. However, in St. Andrews Hotel v. Ceylon Mercantile Union CA

18

138/85 decided on 01.04.1993 it was recognized that a dismissal cannot be set

aside as wrongful solely on the basis that no domestic inquiry was held.

Therefore, it appears that while a domestic inquiry is desirable, in certain cases,

due to the nature of the circumstances a domestic inquiry could be dispensed with.

The emails marked ‘j4’ and ‘j5’ point to the faults/negligence of the Applicant in

carrying out his duties, but shortcomings by other quarters too are mentioned in

the emails. In ‘j4’ sent by Sampath Erahapola the local agent for Regatta, several

shortcomings are listed out; that there were broken stitches in many of the

garments, that the workers were on continuous night shifts thereby affecting their

productivity, that there was no management level involvement even after re-

screening, that internal audits were failing to correct the defects in the order prior

to shipping, and that there was no assurance of quality from the Quality Assurance

Department. The only shortcomings that can be directly connected to the Applicant

were, that there was a delay in starting the packing despite being advised to

commence the packing in good time, and that the Packing Manager was not

present in the Factory while the work was going on. In ‘j5’ sent by Kelum

Warnapatabendi, the Senior Product Technologist for ‘Next’ in Sri Lanka it has

been stated that “I have given you an approved sample for packing/presentation.

All your seniors (specially Packing Manager) are well aware with the

requirements.” Loading the goods to the container without pre-final approvals and

ignoring Quality Assurance comments of unloading the goods for inspection had

been pointed out as shortcomings.

From the above comments in the emails, it can be seen that there were several

shortcomings regarding the Regatta order for which the Applicant cannot be held

to be singularly liable. It should be noted that the senior management was aware

of the shortcomings but had made no meaningful involvement in remedying them.

The evidence led at the Labour Tribunal fails to conclusively shed light on whether

the length of the polybags was not as required due to the negligence of the

19

Applicant or the Quality Assurance Department or due to circumstances beyond

their control, such as directions from the higher management concerned with cost

cutting.

If the emails were the reason for dispensing with the requirement of holding a

domestic inquiry, the contents of the two emails themselves bear evidence that

there were several shortcomings in the production process of the Appellant’s

Factory for which the Applicant could not be held solely responsible. What is more,

it could have been that the issues in the production process themselves could have

affected the quality of the Applicant’s performance. For instance, the Applicant’s

evidence led before the Labour Tribunal (page 91) has shown that the Applicant

was saddled with the extra duty of attempting to procure certain machines that

were required for the process of manufacturing the ‘Next’ order. Applicant had

said that he made an unsuccessful attempt to get the required machinery from one

of their establishments in Pita-Kotte and failing that they obtained the machinery

from their Marawila Factory and found the machines mechanically defective and

finally had to go to a Factory in Avissawella to perfect the order (page 153). The

evidence of the Applicant to this effect was not contested by the Appellant-

Company. In this backdrop the observation made by the High Court that the

Applicant has been made a ‘scapegoat’ for the issues caused by the misguided

decisions of the higher level of management in accepting an order that the

Petitioner Factory was ill equipped to manufacture, seems justified.

What the High court has endeavoured to do, is to point out the dictates of natural

justice that require a domestic inquiry in the circumstances of the present case,

where there has not been conclusive evidence that the conduct of the Applicant

was so serious as to justify termination. Further the High Court has noted that the

conduct of the Appellant-Company in informing the Applicant that a domestic

inquiry would be held and then postponing the inquiry to a later date and

thereafter handing over a letter of termination on the day the Applicant went to

the factory to face the domestic inquiry has unjustly prevented the Applicant from

20

presenting his side of the story vis a vis the alleged shortcoming on his part. Where

the two emails themselves are insufficient to provide clout to the decision to

terminate the Applicant, and in fact point to larger issues that have negatively

affected the performance of the factory, the High Court cannot be faulted for

holding that the lack of a domestic inquiry, especially where one had originally

been scheduled, takes away from the justification of the termination of the

Applicant’s services.

Although as a matter of ‘law’ the High Court holding that the termination of the

services of the Applicant without a domestic inquiry is both unjust and

unreasonable is a misdirection on its part, this court is of the view that this was a

classic case that cried for holding of a domestic inquiry before termination.

Although I answer the question of law referred to in subparagraph (i) of Paragraph

10 of the petition in the affirmative, I hold that the misdirection on the part of the

learned High court is not grave enough to set aside the judgment of the learned

High Court Judge.

Question (c)

Now I shall consider whether the High Court failed to evaluate the evidence

establishing the grave negligence of the Applicant. The gravamen of the Appellant-

Company’s submissions to the Labour Tribunal was that loss would be caused to

the company due to the negligence of the Applicant. However, that a loss was in

fact caused, and if so, the amount of such loss was not submitted nor proved by the

Appellant-Company. The two emails marked ‘j4’ and ‘j5’ said to be sent by the

local agents for the international buyers ‘Next’ and ‘Regatta’ have not been proved

by calling Jude Virajith, the Manager of the Appellant-Company who had received

and forwarded the e-mails, to give evidence, thus, diminishing the probative

evidentiary value of the contents of those e-mails.

21

The written submissions on behalf of the Applicant were that the Appellant-

Company failed to lead direct evidence and prove before the Labour Tribunal the

charge against the Applicant in compliance with the Evidence Ordinance. In the

written submissions Rodrigo v. Central Engineering Consultation Bureau 2009 (1)

SLR 248 was cited to point out that it is the Appellant-Company that should adduce

evidence to prove the serious allegations against the Respondent. “In Labour

Tribunal proceedings where the termination of services of a workman is admitted

by the respondent, the onus is on the latter to justify termination by showing that

there were just grounds for doing so and that the punishment imposed was not

disproportionate to the misconduct of the workman. The burden of proof lies on

him who affirms, and not upon him who denies as expressed in the maxim ei

incimbit probatio, qui dicit, non quinegat.”

An act of misconduct was defined in the Indian case Shalimar Rope Works

Mazdoor Union v. Shalimar Rope Works Ltd 1953 (2) LLJ 876 thus; “An act should

be regarded as an act of misconduct if it is inconsistent with the fulfillment of

express or implied conditions of service or if it has a material bearing on the

smooth and efficient working of the concern.” Justice Priyasath Dep PC, as he then

was, in Gamage v. M. D. Gunasena (2013) SLR 143 was of the opinion that “The

implied conditions of service include conduct such as obedience, honesty,

diligence, good behavior, punctuality, due care. Therefore, acts such as

disobedience, insubordination, dishonesty, negligence, absenteeism and late

attendance, assault are treated as acts of misconduct which are inconsistent with

the implied conditions of service”. The degree of misconduct which justifies

termination necessarily depends on the “nature of the business and the position

held by the employee” Jupiter General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shroff (1973) 3 AEHR

67 as quoted in H. G. Jayasekera v. The Ceylon Transport Board CGG 14, 359 of

26.03.65 at para 24.

The Applicant has accepted that as Packing Manager he is the officer entrusted

with the final responsibility of packing. However, giving evidence before the

22

Labour Tribunal (at pages 85-90) the Applicant’s uncontested stance was that two

meetings were held with the participation of the higher management of the

factory, the Quality Assurance Manager and the Applicant himself, before

commencing the production of the ‘Next’ order where he and the Quality

Assurance Manager had raised the concern that the Appellant-Company’s factory

was not equipped to produce the order to the standard of quality expected by the

international buyer.

Furthermore, regarding the length of the polybags being in excess of the

specifications, the High court has questioned whether the quality controller of the

factory has no responsibility for preventing the shipment of the goods that do not

meet quality standards, and what the job duties of the Packing Manager were.

These are valid concerns as they play an imperative role in identifying whether the

Applicant was singularly responsible for the polybags being longer than as

specified and therefore liable for any damage caused, thereby justifying his

termination. Facts adequate to conclusively answer these questions have not been

adduced.

The second limb of Question (c) is whether the High Court failed to evaluate the

evidence that the Applicant had been previously warned as to his negligence

pertaining to the packing function. Neither the Labour Tribunal nor the High Court

in its judgment has referred to the previous warning given to the Applicant by

letter dated 29th September 2007 marked ‘j1’. The Applicant had loaded cartons

of clothing of a Regatta order into the container without the prior approval or

permission of the Regatta representative one Sampath, and he had been warned

not to deviate from the proper rules and procedures and that if such an incident is

reported in the future, action would be taken against him as it is a serious offence.

However, the present allegation is not relating to the loading of finished goods but

an allegation totally unconnected. In the present case, whether the Applicant was

negligent, has not been established by the Appellant-Company to the degree of

23

proof required. The inevitable inference that can be drawn from this is that there

was no justifiable basis for the termination of the Applicant. On a side note, had a

disciplinary inquiry been held, this question of the bona fides of the Appellant-

Company and the dearth of evidence before the Labour Tribunal could have been

avoided.

Thus, I answer the questions of law (a) and (c) in the negative. The question of law

(i) is answered in the affirmative, however due to the reasons delineated in this

judgement, I hold that no substantial prejudice has been caused to the Appellant.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal subject to costs.

Appeal dismissed.
