The three Plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of

Galle seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the two Defendants

therefrom, and damages. The Defendants filed a joint answer

seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffs action, a declaration that

they are the owners of the land, and damages.

At the trial, admissions were recorded, and issues were raised

and the case was re-fixed for further trial. The Defendants

were not ready on the date of further trial and the trial was

postponed. On the next date, the Defendants were absent

and their Attorney-at-Law informed Court that she had no

instructions. The Court fixed the case for ex parte trial

against the Defendants.

At the ex parte trial, the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff was led by

a Presidents Counsel and documents P1-P7 were marked.

The learned District Judge did not ask a single question from

the witness nor was any clarification sought from Counsel for

the Plaintiffs. The ex parte Judgment was postponed. By the

ex parte Judgment delivered on 24.04.2009, the District

5

Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs action on the basis that the

Plaintiff failed to identify the corpus.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed the

Judgment of the District Court. Hence the Plaintiffs before

the final Court.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the question whether

the High Court erred in law when it held that the corpus had

not been identified in view of the unique facts of this case.

In my view, this question of law shall be answered in the

affirmative and the appeal shall be allowed. Let me explain.

The parties to this action are members of the same family.

They are not strangers to one another. The land in suit,

which was their mothers property, is described in the

schedule to the plaint.

The Defendants inter alia in paragraphs 2 and 15 of the

answer admitted the corpus and, in the prayer to the answer,

sought a declaration of title to the corpus in their favour.

Furthermore, at the trial, by way of a formal admission

recorded as admission No. 2, the corpus was admitted. In

terms of section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance, admitted facts

need not be proved unless the court may, in its discretion,

require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such

admissions. But in this case, the Court did not require the

corpus to be proved or properly identified despite its

admission by the Defendants.

Obviously, no issue was raised at the trial on the

identification of the corpus. Both the Plaintiffs and the

Defendants raised issues on the premise that the corpus was

6

admitted. For instance, issue No. 26 raised by the

Defendants is: Have the Defendants acquired prescriptive title

to this land and the house? Be it noted that the Defendants

speak of this land. Then what is this fuss about non-

identification of the corpus?

What the learned District Judge states in essence is that

although the land is described by a Lot number in the

schedule to the plaint, the Plan number is not mentioned and

therefore the land has not been properly identified. This is an

omission on the part of the Plaintiffs Attorney-at-Law. What

is typed in the schedule to the plaint as the subject matter of

the dispute is the land described in the schedules to the

deeds, which are all pleaded and produced in evidence. The

Plan number is mentioned in the schedules to all these deeds.

The Plaintiffs filed this action seeking a declaration of title

and ejectment of the Defendants from the entire land

described in the schedule to the plaint, not from a portion of

it. The Defendants counter claim is also for the entire land.

There is no ambiguity whatsoever as to the identification of

the corpus by the Defendants against whom this action has

been filed.

The system of justice we practice is adversarial as opposed to

inquisitorial, and therefore, the Judge shall decide the case as

it is presented before him by the two contesting parties and

not in the way the Judge prefers it to have been presented

before him.

In the Supreme Court case of Saravanamuthu v. Packiyam

[2012] 1 Sri LR 298, the Plaintiff instituted the action in the

District Court against the Defendants for a declaration of title

7

to the land described in the schedule to the plaint, ejectment

of the Defendants therefrom, and damages. The Defendants

in their answer admitted their residence and the situation of

the land as averred in the plaint but denied the Plaintiffs

claim. In the answer, they stated that the land is the same as

that described in the schedule to the plaint, but described the

land in the answer according to their deed. After trial, the

District Court entered Judgment for the Plaintiff. On appeal,

the High Court of Civil Appeal ordered a re-trial on the basis

that Counsel for both parties had failed to draw the attention

of Court to the discrepancy between the schedules to the

plaint and the answer.

On appeal to this Court, Sripavan J. (later C.J.), whilst

stating at page 301 It must be remembered that the

jurisdiction of the Court is limited to the dispute presented for

adjudication by the contesting parties, held at page 302 that

In view of the specific admission made by the Respondents in

paragraph 4 of the answer there was no dispute amongst the

parties as to the identification of the corpus even though the

corpus is described differently in the answer. It is observed

that no issue was raised before the District Court as to the

identity of the corpus. The High Court sought to deal with the

point that had not been an issue before the learned District

Judge. The appeal was allowed and the Judgment of the

District Court was restored.

Although the trial in the instant action was taken up ex parte

against the Defendants, without purging the default, the

Defendants were allowed to participate at the argument

before the High Court, as in an appeal filed against a

Judgment entered inter partes.

8

It is unfortunate that the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed

the Judgment of the District Court and dismissed the appeal

with costs.

The learned High Court Judge attempts to justify the

conclusion of the District Judge in a perplexing manner. He

states:

The Plaintiffs have produced title deeds for the land

described in the plaint. It is also correct that both parties

have admitted the land described in the schedule to the

plaint as the subject matter of this action. The subject

matter means the land for which the dispute arose

between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. The

Defendants admitted that the dispute arose for the land

described in the plaint. However, there is no proof that

the defined lot 1 of lot D mentioned in the title deeds of

the Plaintiffs is the portion of land where the dispute

arose between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. Hence

it is essential to depict the land for which the Plaintiffs

seek a declaration of title.

The learned High Court Judge states there is no proof that

the defined Lot 1 of Lot D mentioned in the title deeds of the

Plaintiffs is the portion of land in respect of which the dispute

arose between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. In the

schedule to the plaint, the land is described as the defined

Lot 1 of Lot D. The High Court Judge acknowledges that the

Defendants admit that the dispute arose in respect of the

land described in the plaint. I fail to understand this line of

thinking of the learned High Court Judge.

Litigation is not wordplay, nor is it a game to be won by the

cleverer or more astute. It is a far more serious contest

authorised by law, in a court of justice, for the purpose of

enforcing a right.

Unless the matter goes to the root of the case, cases need not

be dismissed on flimsy technical grounds.

In Silva v. Selohamy (1923) 25 NLR 113, decided nearly a

century ago, Schneider J. remarked at 114: It is not the

policy of the Civil Procedure Code to throw out applications for

relief for defect in pleadings. On the contrary, its policy would

appear to be otherwise.

The High Court relied upon Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR

333 to dismiss the appeal which reaffirmed the established

principal that be it rei vindicatio or partition if the corpus

cannot be identified, the action cannot be maintained. There

is no question about the legal principal expounded in

Latheefs case but the issue lies in the applicability of this

principal to this case where the facts are totally different.

In Latheefs case, there was a real dispute in the

identification of the corpus. There was no admission

recorded as to the corpus and the 1st to 5th issues raised at

the trial revealed that there was a dispute regarding the

identity of the corpus. The Court then issued not one but two

commissions to different surveyors to identify the corpus.

After the return of the commissions, the 6th issue was raised

putting the identification of the corpus in issue. The identity

of the corpus was so complex that this Court dedicated 12

pages in the Judgment (pages 378-390) to deal with this

question. In the instant action there is no such issue.

10

A principle laid down in a case shall be understood in the

context of the peculiar facts and circumstances of that

particular case. Such principles have no universal application

unless the facts and circumstances in both cases are on all

fours.

In the House of Lords decision of Quinn v. Leathem [1901] AC

495, the question arose on the applicability of the former

decision of the same House in Allen v. Flood [1898] AC 1,

which, if boldly applied, the Plaintiff had no case. If upon

these facts so found the Plaintiff could have no remedy against

those who had thus injured him, Lord Halsbury remarked, it

could hardly be said that our jurisprudence was that of a

civilized community, nor indeed do I understand that any one

has doubted that, before the decision in Allen v. Flood in this

House, such fact would have established a cause of action

against the Defendants.

Lord Halsbury emphasised at page 506:

[E]very judgment must be read as applicable to the

particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since

the generality of the expressions which may be found

there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law,

but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the

case in which such expressions are to be found. The

other is that a case is only an authority for what it

actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for

a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.

Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is

necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must

acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.

11

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

the Judgment of the District Court and direct the learned

District Judge to enter ex parte Judgment as prayed for in the

prayer to the plaint on the uncontroverted evidence led at the

trial.

The Plaintiffs are entitled to costs in all three Courts.
