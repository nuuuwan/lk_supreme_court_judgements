Introduction

1. The Petitioner in SC FR Application 556/2008, a media professional and Convenor

of the Free Media Movement at the time of the alleged infringement, complained

of the infringement of his fundamental rights under Articles 10, 12(1), 12(2),

14(1), 14(1)(a) of the Constitution due to the abrupt termination and/or

censoring of the programme ‘Ira Anduru Pata’ in which he was appearing as a

panelist. The particular episode of the programme in question was televised on the

‘Rupavahini Channel’ of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (hereinafter

referred to as ‘SLRC’) on 4th November 2008. The court granted leave to proceed

for the infringement of Articles12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution.

2. The Petitioner in SC FR Application 557/2018 is a viewer of the same programme

‘Ira Anduru Pata’ who complained that the decision of the Respondents to abruptly

stop and/or censor the televising of that particular episode of the programme on

4th November 2008 was an infringement of his fundamental rights under the

Articles 10, 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Petitioner was

granted leave to proceed for the alleged infringement of Articles 10 and 12(1) of

the Constitution.

3. With the consent of the learned Counsel representing the Petitioners and the

Respondents, both applications were taken up for argument together. Combined

written submissions were filed on behalf of the Respondents in both applications.

The Averments in SC FR Application 556/2008

4. On 3rd November 2008 the Petitioner in SC FR Application 556/2008 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as ‘Kurukulasuriya’) was invited by the SLRC to participate

5

in the programme titled ‘Ira Anduru Pata’ (‘brd w÷re mg’ or Challenge the

Darkness) to discuss the ‘Private Television Broadcasting Station Regulations of

2007’ (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ‘the Regulations’) issued and

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1570/35. The 3rd Respondent, a

producer of programmes of the SLRC at the time had invited the Petitioner via

telephone and had briefed the Petitioner regarding the programme. The Petitioner

had been informed that the other two panelists would be Charitha Herath, Senior

Lecturer of the Department of Philosophy of the University of Peradeniya and an

advisor to the Ministry of Media and Telecommunication, and Dhamma

Dissanayake, a Senior Lecturer of the University of Colombo and a Director of the

Sri Lanka Foundation.

5. The Petitioner maintains that he was informed that the discussion would be

televised live on the ‘Rupavahini Channel’ for a duration of one and a half hours

from 10.30 pm until 12 midnight on the 4th of November 2008. He had also been

informed that the viewers would be allowed to direct questions to the panelists via

telephone calls during the telecast.

6. The Petitioner states that he accepted the invitation to participate in the

programme representing the ‘Free Media Movement’. The Respondents, however,

dispute this assertion and state that the Petitioner was invited as an independent

panelist and not as a representative of the ‘Free Media Movement’ or any other

non-governmental organization.

7. On the 4th of November 2008 the programme commenced as scheduled, at 10.30

pm with the presenter of the programme, Chaminda Gunaratne, an employee of

the SLRC introducing the panelists and the topic for discussion. The Petitioner

avers that prior to the commencement of the programme it had been decided that

in each round, the other two panelists would comment on the topic which would

be followed by the Petitioner’s response, thereby allowing each panelist to express

his viewpoint, for about 5 to 10 minutes in every round and that the panelists

6

were expected to express their views freely, discussing the sociopolitical aspects

and the adverse implications of introducing the Regulations as appearing in the

Gazette.

8. The Respondents state that prior to the commencement of the programme the 3rd

Respondent, the Producer of the programme, briefed the participants on the topic

and the parameters of the discussion as well as the limitations applicable.

According to the Respondents, the participants were specifically requested to

strictly limit their presentations to the topic, refrain from obstructing the other

panelists, refrain from engaging in personal attacks on the characters of

individuals and to avoid making defamatory statements, or any statements that

would make the SLRC and its employees, liable for contempt of court and to avoid

reference to any proceedings pending before a court of law, to all of which they

had agreed.

9. During the course of the programme it had been interrupted only once for a very

brief commercial break at 11.00 pm to convey the time. Thereafter around 11.14

pm, after a lapse of approximately 45 minutes from the commencement of the

programme the discussion was interrupted and the programme interrupted by a

commercial break with the presenter stating; “fyd|hs m%Yak iudcfha we;s fjkjd

kï ta m%Yakj,g úi÷ï ;sfhkak ´k¡ b;ska wksjd¾fhkau úi÷ï ,nd.kafka fldhs

wdldrfhkao lshk tl ms<sn|jhs wms l;d l< hq;=j ;sfnkafka¡ th ;ud iudcfha

wkd.;h i|yd jeä jYfhka fya;=jla njg m;ajkafka¡ wms flá

úrduhla ,nd .kakjd oeka.” (In short; “If issues arise in the society, we must

deliberate as to how solutions can be found to resolve those problems. Now we

take a short break.”)

10. The Respondents claim that during the first round of discussion the Petitioner

deviated from the guidelines of the programme and made a political speech

alleging that the media was exercising self-restraint and referred to a court case

pending against a journalist under the Prevention of Terrorism (Special

7

Provisions) Act. The Petitioner had also disturbed the presentations of the other

panelists. The Petitioner on the other hand, denies this claim and states that he

abided by the instructions.

11. Following the commercial break, the programme did not recommence although

the presenter and the panelists were present in the studio. Instead, a series of

advertisements were televised followed by a number of songs. The 3rd Respondent

had thereafter come to the studio and said that he was facing a difficulty in

continuing with the programme. Upon inquiry he had intimated that when the

commercial break was taken the line had been transferred to the Main Control

Room which is under the direct control of the 2nd Respondent and that the line

had not been transferred to the studio room to continue the programme.

12. Shortly thereafter, the 3rd Respondent had informed them, that the programme

could not be continued as it had been stopped by the authorities. According to the

Petitioner the 3rd Respondent had stated that, the programme could only have been

stopped on the instructions of the 2nd Respondent.

13. The Respondents take up the position that, once the telecasting of the programme

had commenced, the 2nd Respondent had received several telephone calls querying

as to why his Corporation had permitted a Petitioner who had challenged the

validity of the Private Television Broadcasting Station Regulations of 2007 by way

of a Fundamental Rights Application, to appear on National Television and refer

to matters which were the subject of a case pending before the Supreme Court

(paragraph 11(a) of the 2nd Respondent’s Statement of Objections). The 2nd

Respondent has stated that at that point he sought the advice of the legal adviser

of the 1st Respondent Corporation, Attorney-at-Law Jayantha De Silva and realized

that it was not proper to discuss any matter which is pending before a court of law

on live television.

8

14. The 2nd Respondent had also expressed [to the 3rd Respondent] his own concern

over the same matter (per paragraph 11(d) of the Objections). The 3rd Respondent

had replied that the Petitioner had not divulged to him any information about the

pending Fundamental Rights application, and that he would speak to the Petitioner

during the commercial break that was to follow. An affidavit by the 3rd Respondent

(‘1R3’) has been submitted.

15. The legal advisor had then, via telephone, notified the 2nd Respondent that the

court reporters had confirmed that the Petitioner and several others had filed

Fundamental Rights Applications challenging the Regulations under discussion

and the matter had been fixed for support on 5th, 6th or 14th November 2008. The

2nd Respondent had then been advised that since the matter is accordingly sub

judice, it would be inappropriate to discuss the same on live television as any

inappropriate statement made by the panelists would make the entire Board of

Directors liable to face contempt of court proceedings. Attorney-at-Law Jayantha

de Silva has confirmed this position by his affidavit produced marked ‘IR2’.

16. The Respondents claim that the 2nd Respondent had reasons to believe that the

Petitioner intended to embarrass the management of the 1st Respondent

Corporation since the Petitioner had suppressed the fact that he had litigated on

the very topic he was invited to discuss. In view of such apprehensions, the 2nd

Respondent, as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Director General

of the 1st Respondent Corporation, had immediately directed the 3rd Respondent

to terminate the programme and informed the Main Control Room of his decision.

(per paragraph 11(g) and 11(h) of the Objections and paragraph 12(h) of the

affidavit of the 2nd Respondent).

17. The Petitioner on the other hand has flatly refuted the 2nd Respondent’s claim in

his counter affidavit. He states that, he had revealed his intention to challenge the

regulations at a stakeholder meeting convened by the Minister of Mass Media and

Information, on 4th November 2008, two days prior to the filing of the application.

9

The Petitioner argues that the 2nd Respondent and the panelist Charitha Herath,

who were attendees at that meeting, were fully aware of the pending litigation,

and that in any event, the fact that a case was pending in court should not prevent

a broadcaster from debating issues of public importance.

18. The Petitioner argues that the justification offered for the termination of the

programme should be rejected for several reasons. The contemporaneous

recordings regarding the manner and reasons for stopping a programme midway

are generally compiled by the Production Division but no such document has been

produced by the Respondents for the perusal by the court. Even though the

Petitioner repeatedly inquired the reason for stopping the programme neither he,

nor the other panelists, had been informed of any reasons by the officials of the 1st

Respondent Corporation. The Petitioner refutes the contents of the affidavits

marked ‘IR2’ and ‘IR3’ submitted by the Legal Consultant of the SLRC and the 3rd

Respondent respectively, and states that, in the case of the latter affidavit, the 3rd

Respondent was well aware of the pending litigation at the time of inviting him to

participate in the discussion.

19. The Respondents in turn argue that the Petitioner was only an invitee and that the

1st Respondent Corporation was at liberty to revoke the invitation at their

discretion. They further contend that neither the Petitioner nor any citizen has the

absolute right to demand an opportunity to express their views or make speeches

on National Television.

The Averments in SC FR Application 557/2008

20. The Petitioner in SC FR Application 557/2018 (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as ‘Jayasekara’) claims that he has been engaged in media journalism for over 15

years, and that he is a regular viewer of the programme ‘Ira Anduru Pata’. The

Petitioner states that he had been closely following the developments regarding

10

the introduction of the Private Television Broadcasting Station Regulations of

2007.

21. According to Petitioner Jayasekera, the programme usually spanned a duration of

one and a half hours to two hours and included a ‘phone-in’ component where

the viewers were given the opportunity to participate via telephone thereby

making it a participatory programme. On 4th November 2008 there had been

several advertisements regarding the programme on the Rupavahini channel,

prior to it being telecast.

22. The Petitioner Jayasekara claims that the presenter specifically stated that the

viewers can directly ask questions on matters pertaining to the said regulations. A

copy of the recording of the programme furnished by the Petitioner in Application

556/2008 confirms this averment. About two minutes into the programme, the

presenter announced that viewers could express their views or ask questions.

23. The Petitioner had waited in anticipation to participate in the programme by

raising questions and expressing his views, when the programme was interrupted

by a commercial break. When the programme did not recommence after the

commercial break as is the usual practice, the Petitioner had called the SLRC

general number i.e. 0112-599 506 and queried whether the programme for the

day had been stopped. The receptionist had given the Petitioner another number

and requested him to clarify the matter with the ‘Producing Section’. The Petitioner

had not been successful in contacting the ‘Producing Section’ as no one had

answered the call. The Petitioner had then reverted to the receptionist who had

informed him that they were unable to provide further assistance regarding the

discontinuation of the programme. Around 11.45 pm the Petitioner had managed

to contact Uvindu Kurukulasuriya, the Petitioner in Application 556/2008 over

the phone who had then confirmed that the programme for that particular day

had been terminated by the SLRC.

11

Analysis

24. There is no question that the duration of the programme was scheduled to exceed

45 minutes, and that on 4th November 2008, the telecast did commence at the

planned time. The Programme schedule for 4th November 2008 of the Rupavahini

Channel marked ‘P2’, indicates that the “Ira Anduru Pata-Live Discussion” was

scheduled to commence at 22:30 hrs. and was to continue up to the “End of

transmission” at 24:00 hrs. There is nothing to indicate that any other programme

was slotted for that period. It is also apparent that the prior understanding was

that the programme was to continue beyond 23:14 hrs. This is borne out by the

presenter’s words immediately before the short break “…wms flá

úrduhla ,nd .kakjd oeka.” (We are taking a short break now.) per ‘P3’, the

recording of the programme submitted by Petitioner Kurukulasuriya.

25. Therefore, it is evident that paragraph 2 of the Respondents’ Statement of

Objections, where they deny that the programme was scheduled to be telecasted

for a period of one and a half hours and that there would be telephone calls from

viewers, does not appear to be correct.

26. The Respondents have alleged that during the first round of the discussion the

Petitioner deviated from the topic of discussion by making political speeches,

alleging that the Media was subject to self-censorship, and referring to a pending

court case against a journalist detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

Having viewed the recording of the programme, I observe that the Petitioner did

in fact make those statements; namely that Sri Lanka’s global ranking in media

freedom has fallen from 52 to 165, journalists had been murdered and kidnapped

under the incumbent government, journalists who wrote security analyses had

been assaulted or threatened, there was a self-imposed censorship in the whole

media sector, these regulations were being introduced during the tenure of a

president who used to be a friend of the media, and that a journalist was being

detained for more than 100 days without a hearing.

12

Making a Political Speech

27. The judgements of the Supreme Court constitute a body of jurisprudence that has

evolved over the years, and the Supreme court has recognized that the right to

comment on public issues and criticize public officials and public institutions is

essential for the exercise of civil and political freedoms so valued by democratic

society (See Joseph Perera v. The Attorney General (1992) 1 Sri LR 199;

Amaratunga v. Sirimal and Others (1993) 1 Sri LR 264; Wijeratne v. Vijitha

Perera, Sub-Inspector of Police, Polonnaruwa and Others (2002) 3 SLR 319;

Deshapriya and Another v. Municipal Council Nuwara Eliya and Others (1995)

1 Sri LR 362; Dissanayake v. University of Sri Jayawardenapura (1986) 2 SLR 254;

Sunila Abeysekara v. Ariya Rubasinghe, Competent Authority and Others (2000)

1 SLR 314). This view was succinctly expressed in Deshapriya and Another v.

Municipal Council Nuwara Eliya and Others (supra);

“The right to support or to criticise governments and political parties,

policies and programmes is fundamental to the democratic way of

life; …and democracy requires not merely that dissent be tolerated, but that

it be encouraged (De Jonge v. Oregon (2), Amaratunga v. Sirimal(3),

Wijeratne v. Perera and Pieris v. A. G. (s).” (at page 370)

and thus, in Amaratunga v. Sirimal (supra);

“Criticism of the Government, and of political parties and policies, is per

se, a permissible exercise of the freedom of speech and expression under

Article14 (1)(a).” (at page 271)

28. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Respondents’ contention that a speech should

be censored purely for being political. I do not think that all political speeches

should be shunned and censored. A speech that promotes or pays excessive

homage to a particular political party or politician in a partial and an imbalanced

manner may be distasteful to a section of the society. It may even sit very oddly in

13

a programme that is not concerned with political matters. An invitee must be both

responsible enough and ethical enough to abide by the agreed parameters of the

discussion and confine himself to the topic under discussion. The need to observe

the ethical and responsible conduct should not however provide an excuse for

censoring the opinions of another. The Constitution of Sri Lanka only curtails free

speech to maintain racial and religious harmony, parliamentary privilege, to avoid

contempt of court and defamation or to avoid incitement to an Offence. The nature

of the expression being political is certainly not a criterion recognized in the

Constitution to limit freedom of expression. Even if it were a criterion for

limitation, in the present case the Petitioner did not mention the name of any

political party or politician whose interests, he sought to advance nor did he state

that media freedom in the country would have been in a better state under a

different government. He voiced his dissatisfaction with a certain state of affairs,

he criticized the incumbent government. It was an opinion, and from the

perspective of the SLRC, could be considered political dissent, which however does

not call for the restriction of such comment. An expression that is well within the

parameters of the law as set out in Article 15, does not lose its legitimacy for being

political or for being unpalatable to those who listen to it. If every speech which

points out the shortcomings of an incumbent government or politicians were to

be interpreted as being a political speech and censored, no legitimate criticism

which could promote better governance would ever be made.

29. At this point I would also like to cite the unanimous view of the Supreme Court

expressed in Fernando v. The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and Others

(1996) 1 SLR 157 (at page 172);

“…the media asserts, and does not hesitate to exercise, the right to criticize

public institutions and persons holding public office; while, of course, such

criticism must be deplored when it is without justification, the right to make

and publish legitimate criticism is too deeply ingrained to be denied.”

14

The media is not restrained from publicizing or broadcasting criticism provided

that such criticism is legitimate, and the objective of the criticism is not for one to

obtain an undue advantage to the disadvantage of another.

30. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on the right to freedom

of expression is mainly concerned with whether there has been an interference

with the right and whether such interference can be justified. It is useful as a

source of persuasive guidance in Sri Lanka in determining the parameters within

which permissible interference on the freedom of expression can be justified. The

European Court of Human Rights in its noteworthy decision in Lingens v. Austria

(8 July 1986, Series A No. 103) provided a guideline for ‘acceptable criticism’. The

matter in issue was whether the confiscation of two articles written by an Austrian

journalist and the imposition of a fine on him for accusing the retiring Chancellor

of supporting a former Nazi to engage in the country’s politics, was a restriction

of the Freedom of Expression recognized in Article 10 of the European Convention

on Human Rights. At paragraph 42 of the judgment, it was stated that while the

press should respect the entitlement to the protection of reputation which extends

to all persons, the ‘limits of acceptable criticism’ were wider regarding politicians

in order to allow the freedom of political debate necessary in a democratic society

and to afford “the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an

opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders.” In Ceylan v. Turkey (8 July

1999, Reports 1999-IV) the European Court held that “the limits of permissible

criticism are wider with regard to government than in relation to a private citizen

or even a politician” (at paragraph 34).

31. The permissible grounds for restricting criticism of the government were

emphasized in Joseph Perera v. Attorney General (supra) at page 225;

“…criticism of government, however unpalatable it be, cannot be restricted or

penalised unless it is intended or has a tendency to undermine the security of the

State or public order or to incite the commission of an offence. Debate on public

issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide open and that may well include

vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on Government.

15

Such debate is not calculated and does not bring the Government into hatred and

contempt.” [emphasis added.]

32. In the present case, the Petitioner Kurukulasuriya criticized the then incumbent

President, a person holding public office, at a forum telecasted by the Rupavahini

Channel. In my view the Petitioner, in the exercise of freedom of speech and

expression, was making a legitimate criticism of a public figure. The Petitioner did

not denigrate the President in harsh words or resort to malicious comments about

the President. I am of the view, that his criticism of the President was neither

character assassination nor defamatory. The Respondents have not contested the

facts presented by the Petitioner regarding the repression of the media. As

correctly held in Mallawarachchi v. Seneviratne, OIC Kekirawa (1992) 1 SLR 181

“A true statement, made in the public interest or in the protection of a lawful

interest, would be clearly in the exercise of freedom of speech although ex facie

defamatory. Such statements may be made by way of criticism of those holding or

seeking public office, particularly where relevant to such office.” Therefore, truth

is a defence for defamation and even if the statement in question was defamatory,

unless the falsity of the statement is proven or at the very least contested, neither

the 1st Respondent Corporation nor this Court can presumptively bar a citizen

from exercising his rights, on the ground of defamation.

33. Regardless of whether the Petitioner appeared in the programme in the capacity

of the Convener of the Free Media Movement or not, the matters he adverted to,

would be issues of concern to him as a journalist. As described by the Respondents

themselves, the objective of the programme was to discuss current issues in the

country. Discussion entails the examination of an issue by considering wide,

varied and conflicting opinions and perspectives. At the commencement of the

programme, the presenter introduced the topic of discussion as “The Regulations

and Media Freedom”. In that light, reference to any alleged persecution of

journalists and censorship can hardly be called irrelevant to the topic as it has a

direct impact on media freedom. It is only natural that the Petitioner will present

16

his perspectives and experiences as a journalist. A skewed discussion focusing only

on the positive aspects of the topic cannot be a successful discussion which can

advance democratic values.

Issue of Sub Judice

34. Sub judice or commenting on ongoing legal proceedings is one form of contempt

of court recognized in Sri Lanka. Although contempt of court as an offence is

recognized, the constituent elements of contempt of court have not received

statutory recognition. What would constitute contempt in the eyes of the court

would vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case.

35. It is pertinent to note that in common law jurisdictions contempt of court operates

as a safeguard mainly regarding pending judicial proceedings in which the

opinion of a jury or the veracity of witnesses, may be affected by comments or

opinions expressed publicly. Buckley J. has explained this situation in the English

case of Vine Products Ltd. v. MacKenzie & Co. Ltd. (1965) 3 All ER 58 (at page

62); “It has generally been accepted that professional judges are sufficiently well

equipped by their professional training to be on their guard against allowing [a

prejudging of the issues] to influence them in deciding the case.”

36. The Petitioner Kurukulasuriya did not speak of anything that would materially

interfere with the judicial proceedings in the particular criminal case or, criticize

the court. He merely alluded to the factual situation regarding the detention of the

said journalist. The Petitioner stated that the journalist was detained for writing

two articles, to highlight the regime abusing provisions of the Prevention of

Terrorism Act. That statement could hardly influence public opinion and have a

material impact on the outcome of the case. Therefore, it would be an overreaction

to say that the Petitioner made a statement that would be held in contempt.

17

37. Fundamental Rights applications pivot on the application of the law and judges,

are in general immune to material in the public domain that may create bias.

Therefore, even though the main subject matter of the programme i. e. the

regulations, relates to the Fundamental Rights application filed by the Petitioner,

the concern of sub judice is minimal. The Respondents have submitted that the

decision in Re Garumunige Tilakaratne (1999)1 SLR 134 provides justification for

the Respondents to take an extra cautionary approach and discontinue the

programme. In the said case, it was held that a news reporter who reported a

speech by a politician in which comments were made prejudging the outcome of

an election petition had committed contempt of court for ‘causing the publication’

of the speech. However, no punishment was imposed on the reporter by the court

which observed “that Contempt of Court is an offence purely sui generis and one

that is vaguely defined; and taking account of the fact that the cognizance of the

offence involves in this case an exceptional interference with the fundamental

right of freedom of speech and expression, including publication….and

considering the fact that the respondent did not have the consequences of his act

as a conscious object of his conduct; and considering that, although as a reporter

he had duties and responsibilities, yet his role in the publication was a

comparatively subordinate one,…”

38. The approach with regard to the application of Article 14(1)(a) and the

limitations that apply, cannot be uniform and the considerations as to its

application should necessarily vary, taking into account the type of the media that

it concerns, be it print, radio or television. The reason being that, in the case of the

print media, it may allow the writer or the editor a comparatively wider margin

of time and the degree of authority in controlling the content of a particular news

item or column. The same may not be available to a producer or a broadcaster of

a live television programme. Therefore, the court’s reasoning in Re Garumunige

Tilakaratne (supra) that the reporter of the offending news item should be held

liable for sub judice for reporting the news item, cannot be applied to the instant

application as the former was a newspaper, whereas the instant application is

18

concerned with a live television programme where speakers were invited to

express their own views in a discussion which was simultaneously being telecast

to the public.

39. As an experienced journalist, the Petitioner Kurukulasuriya could have acted more

responsibly by specifically disclosing beforehand that he had filed a fundamental

rights application regarding the same regulations that were to be discussed in the

programme. In an ideal situation, the uncertainty about being held in contempt

could have been avoided altogether if the Producer could have checked

beforehand with the 3rd respondent, whether the topic of discussion was subject

to any legal impediments such as being a matter pending before the court. Taking

into consideration, however, the tight schedules and the limited resources for

checking for possible legal impediments in the process of putting together a live

discussion programme aired weekly, it would be an undue burden to expect the

SLRC to adopt such stringent measures. Furthermore, I do not wish to limit the

platform for adverse opinions and varied perspectives by setting a standard that

would cause the media to steer clear of providing the opportunity for ‘risky’ views

to be expressed.

40. The Respondents have submitted opinion pieces written by the Petitioner (‘IR4 (a)

to (e)’) which would arguably amount to contempt of court to demonstrate that

the Petitioner has acted in a similar manner on previous occasions. Those opinion

pieces, however, are of little use as justification for the discontinuation of the

programme as they have been published much later in 2011 and 2013. In any

event, if the Respondents were aware beforehand that the Petitioner had earned a

notoriety for writing and publishing contemptuous material it is unlikely that they

would have taken the risk of inviting the Petitioner to the programme.

19

Infringement of Article 14 (1) (a)

41. Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution guarantees to every citizen the freedom of

speech and expression including publication. The exercise of this fundamental

right is subject to restrictions that may be prescribed by law in the interests of

racial and religious harmony or in relation to parliamentary privilege, contempt

of court, defamation or incitement to an offence (Article 15(2)). Further, Article

15(7) stipulates that restrictions may be prescribed by law in the interests of

national security, public order and the protection of public health or morality, or

for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and

freedoms of others, or for meeting the just requirements of the general welfare of

a democratic society.

42. Justice Mark Fernando in Fernando v. Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (supra)

adopted the view expressed in the Indian Case of Secretary, Ministry of

Information v. Cricket Association of Bengal (1995) 2 SCC 161, 292

“broadcasting media by its very nature is different from press. Airwaves are public

property… it is the obligation of the State…to ensure that they are used for public

good.” His Lordship went on to state further that due to the limited nature of

frequencies available for television and radio broadcasts only a handful of persons

are bestowed with the privilege of operating via them and thereby they become

“subject to a correspondingly greater obligation to be sensitive to the rights and

interests of the public.” (at page 172).

43. The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation is a statutory body established by the Sri

Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982 (as amended). Section 7(1)(c)

of the said Act reads thus;

“7(1) The functions of the Corporation shall be—…

(c) that any news given in the programme (in whatever form) is presented

with due accuracy and impartially and with due regard to the public

interest.” (emphasis added).

20

The provision no doubt imposes a statutory obligation on the SLRC to present any

news conveyed through their programmes impartially and with due regard to

public interest.

44. It becomes evident from the above cited precedent and statutory obligations that

neither the 1st Respondent Corporation nor the other Respondents can lawfully

abridge the right of the Petitioner to present a view that is not flattering to the

government that controls the SLRC especially where it is in the interest of the

public to know the state of media freedom in the country. The Respondents’

argument that there is no positive duty cast on the Respondents to provide a forum

for the Petitioner to exercise his fundamental right of speech and expression does

not apply here due to airwaves being public property and attracting a higher

standard of duty as well as due to the statutory obligation imposed on the 1st

Respondent, by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982.

45. The discontinuation of the programme, therefore, in my view, amounts to an

infringement of the exercise of Article 14(1)(a) of the Petitioner Kurukulasuriya.

The Petitioner has alleged that no reasons were given for the discontinuation of

the programme even after he inquired about it, and the Respondents have not

contested this allegation. It is curious that the 3rd Respondent nor any other

employee of the SLRC had not inquired from the Petitioner about the case filed by

him after it became known that he had filed such a case. Failure to divulge to the

petitioner that his own past record had been the reason for discontinuing the

programme hints of a lack of bona fides on the part of the Respondents. The

admission of the 2nd Respondent that he had received several telephone calls

questioning why the Petitioner Kurukulasuriya was allowed to appear on National

Television and present a case, gives rise to the suspicion that the 2nd Respondent’s

decision was influenced by those who found his views unpalatable. It appears that

the Respondents have used sub judice as a cover to evade responsibility for

circumscribing the Petitioner’s freedom of speech and expression.

21

46. The danger of suppressing dissent was emphasized in Gunawardena v. Pathirana,

OIC, Police Station, Elpitiya (1997) 1 Sri LR 265. Stating that dissent, or

disagreement manifested by conduct or action, is a cornerstone of the

Constitution, which should not only be tolerated but encouraged by the Executive

as obligated expressly by Article 4(d), Justice Mark Fernando cited the dictum of

Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barbette (1943) 319

US 624, 641;

“Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves

exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only

the unanimity of the graveyard. It seems trite but necessary to say that the

First Amendment was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these

beginnings.” (at page 277)

47. The lack of credibility in the version of the Respondents, together with their

conduct in abruptly discontinuing the programme without informing the

Petitioner Kurukulasuriya the reason for such a drastic step, reflects of an

imperious attitude on the part of the Respondents, that they have absolute

discretion and control over views that are telecasted through the television

channel that they are steering. Media institutions certainly should be given

discretion to curate their programmes, but such discretion must be exercised

within the objectives and parameters set out in the law referred to earlier. Media

institutions must curate their programmes to include all views and cater to all

citizens equally without manipulating the leverage they have over public opinion.

Unfortunately, attitudes that shun media ethics and legal obligations appear to

influence the conduct of many of the Sri Lankan media institutions, whether state-

owned or private.

48. Sub judice is a legal safeguard and media institutions should not be allowed to use

a safeguard as a cloak to stifle the citizen’s right to freedom of expression

guaranteed by the Constitution. Sub judice is not meant for justifying autocratic

and stifling conduct relating to freedom of expression. These safeguards are for

22

the purpose of creating an equal marketplace of ideas with minimal risk of

polarization. Preventing views that are either disagreeable or disadvantageous to

the broadcaster or the agenda that they seek to further, from reaching the public,

impinges on the citizen’s entitlement to exercise freedom of expression. Although

the Supreme Court’s power to strike down acts or omissions that may lead to the

infringement of fundamental rights is expressly with regard to executive or

administrative action, the courts as an organ of government is mandated by Article

4(d) of the Constitution to respect, secure and advance fundamental rights

declared and recognized by the Constitution. Therefore, I have no hesitation in

observing that it is not desirable for even a semi-private body to be allowed to

make inroads into fundamental rights, in the absence of express prohibitions. As

Shakespeare put it, “We must not make a scarecrow of the law, setting it up to fear

the birds of prey, and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not

their terror.” (Measure for Measure (1604) Act 2, Scene 1.)

Infringement of Article 10

49. Leave to proceed was granted to the Petitioner in application 557/2008 for the

alleged infringement of Article 10. By virtue of Article 10 every person, regardless

of whether they are a citizen or not, is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience

and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his

choice. Article 10 is an absolute right without any constitutionally recognized

restrictions or fetters.

50. The Petitioner Jayasekara’s contention that, the presenter (of the programme)

specifically stated that viewers can ask questions on matters pertaining to the

regulations in discussion is correct, as evidenced by the recording of the

programme submitted by the Petitioner Kurakulasuriya. About two minutes from

the commencement of the programme, the presenter can be heard announcing

that viewers can express their views or ask questions.

23

51. I am unable to agree with the argument of the Respondents that the mere desire

to participate, is insufficient to clothe the Petitioner Jayasekera with the character

of a participatory listener. Even though the Respondents point out that the

Petitioner had called the SLRC only after the programme was discontinued, it

appears that, in spite of announcing that the viewers can phone in, a telephone

number for the public to communicate was not immediately announced. This

might have been with the expectation of opening the telephone lines to the viewers

at a later round of the discussion. I am of the view that, by being a viewer of a

programme with a participatory component via telephone, the Petitioner

Jayasekera becomes a participatory viewer. Even though every viewer of the

programme may not have had the intention of making use of the phone-in

component, the fact that the invitation to phone-in is extended in general to all

viewers who may at any time during the programme decide to avail themselves of

it, makes every viewer a participatory viewer. To my mind, categorization of the

viewer ought to be based on the nature of the programme, rather than on whether

the viewer intended to actually participate or not.

52. Having disposed of that concern, I would now make a distinction between the

Petitioner’s entitlement to gain the information that was being disseminated

through the television programme, and being given the opportunity to phone-in

and raise any questions he may have in relation to the topic of discussion or

express his opinion in relation to the topic. At the outset, it must be accepted that

the ability of a viewer to join a programme via a telephone call is subject to the

overriding discretion of the producers of the programme. The limited time

allocated for the phone-in component necessarily has to be counterbalanced with

the number of phone calls they may receive. The producers may be further

required to restrict certain phone calls and give priority to others, in order, inter

alia, to avoid duplication of questions or opinions, to provide a value-addition to

the discussion and to confine the programme to the prior-agreed bounds.

24

53. On the other hand, the right of the Petitioner as a viewer to gain information from

the programme, in the instant circumstances, cannot also be ignored. The

programme itself was a weekly panel discussion which sought to place before the

public the various aspects of a chosen topic- in the present case the media

regulations that were to be introduced by the government- through speakers

comprising of various stakeholders or experts. The purpose of the programme was

to impart information to the public and enlighten them as suggested by even the

title of the programme ‘Ira Anduru Pata’. Furthermore, the public had an interest

in learning about the regulations, especially those like the Petitioner whose choice

of a programme could be curtailed by the regulations. The views expressed in the

programme could have aided the Petitioner to form an opinion about the

regulations and would likely have provided the clarifications he needed on any

issues as to the proposed regulations. The ability to form and hold an opinion on

regulations that would have an impact on oneself is, to say the least, a

characteristic of the democratic way of life.

54. It is in the backdrop of the afore-stated, that one ought to consider as to whether

the conduct of the Respondents in abruptly terminating the programme, has

infringed the Petitioner Jayasekera’s fundamental right of ‘freedom of thought’

enshrined in Article 10 of the Constitution.

55. Justice Marshall in the US case of Stanley v. Georgia 394 US 557 (1969),

delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court held;

“It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to

receive information and ideas… This freedom [of speech and press] …

necessarily protects the right to receive…This right to receive

information and ideas, regardless of their social worth, is fundamental

to our free society.”

The Appellant’s claim in the said case was that his right to freedom of expression

had been violated. Here it is useful to note that the Constitution of the United States

does not explicitly recognize the right to freedom of thought. This may be the

25

reason for the US courts to recognize the freedom of thought as a peripheral right

or a right included in freedom of speech.

56. The decision in Fernando v. Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (supra) is

significant in that, the Supreme Court considered the US Supreme Court decision

in Stanley v. Georgia and found it difficult to regard the decision as being one

relating to freedom of speech. The Court in the case of Fernando (supra)

considered whether the right to information simpliciter falls within the ambit of

the right to freedom of expression or the right to freedom of thought. It was

observed (at page 177) that;

“In the strict sense, when A merely reads (or hears) what B writes (or says)

in the exercise of B’s freedom of speech, it does not seem that A receives

information in the exercise of A’s freedom of speech, because that would

be to equate reading to writing, and listening to speaking. Accordingly,

while preventing A from reading or listening would constitute a violation

of B’s freedom of speech, it may not infringe A’s freedom of speech. A’s right

to read or listen is much more appropriately referable to his freedom of

thought, because it is information that enables him to exercise that right

fruitfully.” [emphasis added]

57. Justice Fernando was of the opinion that the better rationale is to regard

information simpliciter as the “staple of food of thought” (as was done in the

Stanley v. Georgia) and “a corollary of the freedom of thought guaranteed by

Article 10.” Fernando J. went on to state that “Article 10 denies government the

power to control men's minds, while Article 14 (1) (a) excludes the power to curb

their tongues.” observing that this distinction may be the reason for the difference

in the restrictions placed on those two rights respectively.

58. It appears that, the earlier decisions relating to ‘information’ have followed the

thinking of the US Supreme Court. Joseph Perera v. The Attorney General (supra)

which was decided a few years anterior to Fernando (supra), advanced a different

view from that in Fernando. The right to receive information was seen as a right

26

peripheral to freedom of expression, rather than a right included in freedom of

thought. Citing Justice Douglas’ words (at page 223) in Griswold v. Connecticut

(1965) 28 US 479, to the effect of; “The right of freedom of speech and press

include not only the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read and

freedom of inquiry and the right to teach... These are proper peripheral rights.”

[emphasis added]. Chief Justice Sharvananda went on to state [in Joseph Perera]

that “Freedom of speech and expression consists primarily not only in the liberty

of the citizen to speak and write what he chooses, but in the liberty of the public

to hear and read, what it need.” (at page 223-224). It was further observed that

in a democratic polity, government shall be by the consent of the people and that

such consent should not only be free but also grounded on adequate information.

However, in Fernando the court was reluctant to follow this view on the basis that

it was obiter as the Petitioner’s rights were not found to be infringed in that

particular case.

59. In a previous case, Visuvalingam v. Liyanage (1984) 2 SLR 123- where the court

held that the readers and contributors of a newspaper which was banned from

publication by the Competent Authority had locus standi to seek relief under

Article 126 of the Constitution- Wimalaratne J., with Colin-Thome J., Ranasinghe

J. and Abdul Cader J. agreeing (at page 132-133), was of the opinion that the

freedom to receive information is encompassed within the freedom of speech and

expression guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) and that the restrictions that may be

placed on the freedom of speech and expression would apply to the freedom to

receive information.

60. Justice Rodrigo in his opinion in the said Visualingam case observed, along the

same lines, that; “To impart information there must be a recipient to receive it. So

a reader or hearer is inseparably linked to the concept of publication. One does

not exist without the other. Likewise, if one ceases to exist, so does the other.”

Justice Rodrigo stating that; significantly the right to receive information finds no

place specifically in our Constitution, did not consider Stanley v. Georgia (supra),

27

which was relied on later in Fernando v. SLBC, based on the distinction that it dealt

with “the First Amendment to the US Constitution relating to Freedom of the Press

and not to a provision corresponding to Article 14(1)(a) of our Constitution.” (at

page 150).

61. As the above cited judicial pronouncements indicate, the question as to whether

the right to receive information simpliciter is within the right to freedom of speech

and expression or within the freedom of thought, has been approached in different

ways by the Supreme Court.

62. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as well as the

European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) recognizes Freedom of thought in

conjunction with the Freedom of conscience and religion. Article 18 (1) of the

ICCPR stipulates that “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought,

conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a

religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community

with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship,

observance, practice and teaching.” While Article 9 (1) of the ECHR reads thus;

“Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right

includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in

community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief,

in worship, teaching, practice and observance.”

63. On the other hand, the European Court of Human Rights has combined the right

to information with the freedom of expression. Article 10 of the Convention

guarantees freedom of expression, including the “freedom to hold opinions and to

receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority

and regardless of frontiers.” In Guerra and Others v. Italy Application No.

14967/89; (1998) 26 EHRR 357; [1998] ECHR 7 where the residents in the

vicinity of a chemical factory brought an action against the Government of Italy

for failing to furnish them with information about the health risks posed by the

emissions from the factory, it was stated that “The Court reiterates that freedom

28

to receive information, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention,

basically prohibits a government from restricting a person from receiving

information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him (see the Leander

v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 29, 74). That freedom

cannot be construed as imposing on a State, in circumstances such as those of the

present case, positive obligations to collect and disseminate information of its own

motion.” (at paragraph 53) [emphasis added]. Although the European Court has

been reluctant to impose positive obligations to ensure the right to information,

the right has been recognized as a corollary of the freedom of expression.

64. In the present applications, the programme in question was stopped without

notice. The audience was not informed that the programme for the day was to be

discontinued, nor given the reasons for the sudden discontinuation. It amounts to

a sudden and arbitrary stoppage given the statutory obligation of the SLRC to

present their programmes with due regard to public interest. The manner of

halting the programme without any respect to the wishes of the audience cannot

be viewed lightly. The learned President’s Counsel for the Respondents argued that

the State is not under any positive duty to sponsor or provide State resources for

the petitioner to exercise such rights and drew the attention of the court to

‘Hohfeld’s First Amendment’ analysis by Fredrick Schauer [2008, The George

Washington Law Review Vol 76, 914]. The learned President’s Counsel pointed

out that the ‘negative duty’ cast upon the State is to not infringe, restrict or

interfere, when a person is exercising or enjoying his right with whatever means

or resources available to him.

65. In the said analysis Schauer, makes an interesting point regarding positive and

negative rights under the US Constitution; “...the existing American constitutional

framework is one that prohibits government action rather than one that allows

the citizens to demand it.” [Page 920, emphasis added]. Even in the instant case,

Petitioner Jayasekera’s complaint is against the positive action on the part of the

SLRC authorities, in terminating the programme arbitrarily. In the case of

Rambachan v. Trinidad and Tobago Television Company Ltd [decision 17 July,

29

1985], Justice Jeyalsingh, commenting on the importance of access to television in

the present day society stated, “... Government is duty bound to uphold the

fundamental rights and with television being the most powerful medium of

communication in the modern world, it is in my view idle to postulate that

freedom to express political views means what the Constitution intends it to mean

without the correlative adjunct to express such views on television. The days of

soapbox oratory are over, so are the days of political pamphleteering”. Although

the advent of Social Media has challenged the prominence of Television, it still

remains a force to reckon with in Sri Lanka. In areas with limited internet

connections or limited signal coverage, the State-owned television channels which

enjoy better coverage remain the foremost mode of communication and

dissemination of information, apart from print media.

66. Although the contours of the right to freedom of thought do not appear to have

significantly crystallized through fundamental rights jurisprudence except

perhaps with regard to freedom of religion, to lose the freedom of thought is to

lose one’s dignity, democracy and one’s very self. This might be the reason that

the right is made absolute with no room for derogation. To my mind what the

right aims to secure is, one’s mental autonomy. Arguably, the domain of the

right to freedom of thought should extend to include an external action that is

constitutive of thought. (See Simon McCarthy-Jones in ‘The Autonomous Mind:

The Right to Freedom of Thought in the Twenty-First Century’ at

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2019.00019/full)

67. The law must protect the citizen from threats to the freedom of thought by the

State and its agencies; government needs to act positively in facilitating mental

autonomy. One significant way to foster mental autonomy would be to provide

information in an ‘autonomy supportive’ context. The rights of the listeners to

reply was considered in the case of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 US

367 (1969) where the US Supreme Court stated; “It is the right of the public to

receive suitable access to social, political, aesthetic, moral and other ideas and

30

experiences which is crucial…”. Two of the rights on which the decision in

Red Lion Broadcasting (supra) was based on were, the listener’s right to

equality and the listener’s right to information needed to make his freedom of

speech effective. In my view, information is needed not only to make ‘freedom

of speech’ effective, information is equally relevant to make freedom of thought

effective as well for, if one were to form an opinion, information is an essential

ingredient and opinions are formed through the thought process. Thus, one

cannot detach ‘information’ from the faculty of thought; they are inextricably

interwoven.

68. The Respondents argued that the right to receive specific information from any

particular person or group of persons or a source (such as information on TV

Regulations from panelists of a programme televised by SLRC) could not be

recognised under Article 10 since the jural correlative would impose a

corresponding positive duty on the panelists or the SLRC to provide such

information. I do agree, that as the law stood at the time the alleged

infringement took place. There was no affirmative obligation on the State to

provide information to persons (The enactment of the Right to Information Act

No. 12 of 2016 has now changed this position). A licensed broadcaster,

however, cannot be placed on the same plane as any other institution, due to

the special status they enjoy in being given permission to use airwaves which

are public property.

69. There could be a number of persons seeking broadcast licenses, but due to

limited availability of frequencies to allocate, even though all applicants may

have the identical right to a license, only a selected few can be granted the

license and others will necessarily have to be denied the license. In that context

a licensee is permitted to broadcast, but as observed in the case of Red Lion

Broadcasting (supra) the licensee has no constitutional right “to be the one who

holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his

31

fellow citizens”. In that context a broadcaster who operates on a (frequency)

license granted by the State has the duty to uphold and safeguard the rights of

the public. As Justice White said in the Red Lion Broadcasting case;

“Because of the scarcity of radio frequencies, the Government is

permitted to put restraints on licensees in favour of others whose

views should be expressed on this unique medium. But the people

as a whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their

collective right to have the medium function consistently with the

ends and purposes of the First Amendment [freedom of speech and

press]. It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the

broadcasters, which is paramount.” [emphasis is mine]

70. As far as Petitioner Jayasekera was concerned in the circumstances of the

Application 557/2008, I am of the view that the Petitioner was entitled to receive

information purported to be disseminated by the programme in addition to what

he may have gathered had he got the opportunity to pose questions to the panelists

through the phone-in component of the programme. I agree with the opinion

adopted by His Lordship Justice Mark Fernando in the case of Fernando v. SLBC

(supra) “ …that information is the staple food of thought and that the right to

information simpliciter, is a corollary of freedom of thought guaranteed by Article

10”. As I have stated earlier in the judgement, the decision to terminate the

programme was not due to any justifiable reasons on the part of the Respondents

and I hold it was done arbitrarily on the direction of the 2nd Respondent. In the

circumstances I hold that the fundamental right to freedom of thought, of

Petitioner Jayasekera, enshrined in Article 10 of the Constitution has been

infringed.

Infringement of Article 12(1)

71. Leave to proceed was granted for the infringement of Article 12(1) in both

Applications 556/2008 and 557/2008.

32

72. The ‘classification theory’ or the approach that it is essential to prove that there

was unequal treatment of equals or equal treatment of unequals for a violation of

Article 12 to be recognized, which was followed in the early stages of the

fundamental rights jurisprudence of Sri Lanka (See the full bench decision in

Elmore Perera v. Major Montague Jayawickrema, Minister of Public

Administration and Plantation Industries and Others (1985) 1 SLR 285, C.W.

Mackie and Co. Ltd v. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

and Others (1986)1 SLR 300) has now been replaced in favour of a broader

approach to granting relief.

73. The broader approach has been adopted in a number of subsequent cases, to strike

down arbitrary and mala fide exercise of power and guarantee natural justice and

legitimate expectations. The ambit of Article 12(1) has been extended so far as to

even include Rule of Law. Chief Justice H. N. J. Perera in Sampanthan v. The

Attorney General SC FR 351/2018-356/2018, SC FR 358/2018-361/2018 decided on

13th December 2018, listing out a number of cases where the broader approach

was adopted (Chandrasena v. Kulatunga and Others (1996) 2 SLR 327,

Premawathie v. Fowzie and Others (1998) 2 SLR 373, Pinnawala v. Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation and Others (1997) 3 SLR 85, Sangadasa Silva v. Anurudda

Ratwatte and Others (1998)1 SLR 350, Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd and

Others (1997) 1 SLR 256, Kavirathne and Others v. Pushpakumara and Others SC

FR 29/2012 SC Minutes 25.06.2012, Jayanetti v. Land Reform Commission

(1984) 2 SLR 172 Shanmugam Sivarajah v. OIC, Terrorist Investigation Division

and Others , [SC FR 15/2010, SC Minutes 27. 07. 2017]) went on to hold, (at

page 87);

“I am unable to agree with the submission that Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution recognizes ‘classification’ as the only basis for relief. In a

Constitutional democracy where three organs of the State exercise their

power in trust of the People, it is a misnomer to equate ‘Equal protection’

with ‘reasonable classification’. It would clothe with immunity a vast

33

majority of executive and administrative acts that are otherwise reviewable

under the jurisdiction of Article 126. More pertinently, if this Court were

to deny relief merely on the basis that the Petitioners have failed to establish

‘unequal treatment’, we would in fact be inviting the State to ‘equally

violate the law.‘ It is blasphemous and would strike at the very heart of

Article 4 (d) which mandates every organ of the State to - respect, secure

and advance the fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution. Rule

of Law dictates that every act that is not sanctioned by the law and every

act that violates the law be struck down as illegal. It does not require

positive discrimination or unequal treatment. An act that is prohibited by

the law receives no legitimacy merely because it does not discriminate

between people.”

74. In the present Applications, the discontinuation of the programme affected the

Petitioner Kurukulasuriya as well as the other panelists who were appearing in

the programme alike, by preventing them from expressing their views. In the case

of Petitioner Jayasekara the discontinuation of the programme for the day affected

the Petitioner along with all the other participatory viewers of the programme in

that they were unable to receive the information they sought by watching the

programme and even if they wished so, they were unable to make use of the

phone-in component. Thereby it is clear that the Petitioners’ entitlement to

equality before the law and the equal protection of the law was derogated from.

The law (Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982) requires the SLRC

to maintain high standards in its programmes in the public interest [Section 7 (1)

(a)] and the SLRC is under a duty to maintain a balance in the subject matter

[Section 7(2) (a)] and to ensure that news given in whatever form is presented

with due accuracy, impartially and with due regard to the public interest [Section

7 (2) (c)]. The decision- without any legitimate reason for doing so- to discontinue

the programme for the day, without offering any reasons for such discontinuation

and without informing the viewers of the discontinuation of the programme is

34

arbitrary and mala fide. Therefore, I hold that the rights of both Petitioners under

Article 12(1) have been infringed.

Compensation

75. The matter of awarding compensation for the infringement of fundamental rights

has been discussed by the Supreme Court in a number of cases. Judicial opinion

in such matters has been that, compensation should not be limited only to the

extent of the monetary loss caused. I am of the view that regard should be had to

the curtailment of liberty that resulted in such infringement as well. In

Gunawardena and Another v. Pathirana (supra) and Deshapriya and Another v.

Municipal Council Nuwara Eliya (supra), both cases involving the seizure of

publications, the following opinions were expressed in relation to the awarding of

compensation;

“In deciding whether the petitioners are each entitled

to …compensation, …I must not fail to take account of the numerous

decisions of this Court, stressing the importance of the freedom of

speech, the right to criticise governments and political parties, and

the importance of dissent; of the degree of intrusiveness and undue

haste which characterized the infringements; … and of the fact that

the amount of compensation must not be restricted to the proprietary

loss or damage caused.” See page 274, Gunawardena and another v.

Pathirana, OIC, Police Station, Elpitiya and others (supra).

“We are here concerned with a fundamental right, which not only

transcends property rights but which is guaranteed by the

Constitution; and with an infringement which darkens the climate of

freedom in which the peaceful clash of ideas and the exchange of

information must take place in a democratic society. Compensation

must therefore be measured by the yardstick of liberty, and not

35

weighed in the scales of commerce.” See page 371, Deshapriya and

Another v. Municipal Council Nuwara Eliya (supra).

76. The First Respondent, SLRC being a state corporation, the question of whether the

State should be ordered to pay compensation needs to be dealt with. There is no

question that the State is responsible for safeguarding fundamental rights, and the

ordering of compensation should depend on the circumstances particular to each

case, keeping in mind that the State coffers should not be emptied haphazardly

because the State pays out from the tax-payers money.

77. I am of the view that it is just and equitable to make order, directing the State to

pay the two Petitioners [FR Applications 556 and 557] Rs.30,000 each and I also

direct the 2nd Respondent to pay each of the Petitioners in the said Applications,

Rs.50,000 as compensation.
