Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as Appellant) instituted the above styled

action in the Commercial High Court of the Western Province (Exercising Civil Jurisdiction)

Holden in Colombo (hereinafter referred to as Commercial High Court) against the

Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as Respondent) praying for damages in

a sum of Rupees Twenty-Five Million (Rs. 25,000,000.00). The damages are claimed as a

result of the alleged negligence of the Respondent.

After the framing of admissions and issues, the Respondent suggested that issue nos. 8(a)

and 8(b) be determined as preliminary issues of law. Since the Appellant did not object to

this application, the learned judge of the Commercial High Court decided to rule on the

following issues as preliminary issues of law:

The learned judge of the Commercial High Court held that the Court did not have

jurisdiction to hear and determine the action as it is not an action to enforce any

commercial transaction and that the cause of action is based on negligence and/or breach

of duty of care and not on contract. Consequently, the action of the Appellant was

dismissed.

Aggrieved by the dismissal of the action, the Appellant applied for permission to appeal.

The Court has granted leave to appeal on the following question of law:

Has the learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by holding that the

Commercial High Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the Petitioners case?

This appeal raises an important question of law concerning the jurisdiction of the

Commercial High Court.

By virtue of Article 154P of the Constitution, a High Court was established for every

Province in the country. Several constitutional provisions and other laws specify the

jurisdiction conferred on this High Court.

The High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996 (hereinafter

referred to as the Act) sought to expand its jurisdiction in certain civil actions and

matters specified therein.

The long title of a statute is part of it and, as such, is considered an aid to its construction.

In Union of India v. Elphinstone Spinning and Waving Co Ltd & Ors [AIR (2001) Supreme

Court 724] the Supreme Court of India held that a long title along with the preamble is a

good guide regarding the object, scope or purpose of the statute. However, the long title

of the Act is hardly of assistance in identifying its object, scope or purpose. There is no

preamble to the Act.

Page 4 of 12

However, the following excerpt from the speech made by the Minister at the Second

Reading of the Bill in Parliament provides a clear understanding of the object, scope and

purpose of the Act:

Mr. Speaker, the Bill that is now before the House relates to commercial litigation

specifically. I do not think that there is any doubt that this is one of the impediments

and constraints that has been identified with regard to investments and in our

country. Sometimes there is a reluctance on the part of persons to invest in our

country because of the awareness that when problems arise it takes such a long

time to sort out these problems. There is no efficient machinery available for the

rapid resolution of commercial disputes. This is of interest not only to foreign

investors but to people who engage in entrepreneurial and commercial activity in

our own country. One of the reasons for the exacerbation of this problem, Mr.

Speaker, is a very wide jurisdiction of the District Courts. These commercial matters

have to be adjudicated upon by the District Courts of our country and the District

Courts are already burdened with a great variety of work involving money chums,

contracts, frauds, testamentary jurisdiction, a whole variety of matters. So,

commercial matters are just one among many items that they have to deal within

the course of their day to day work. We think the time has come to make a

departure from that practice and to bring into existence a separate forum which

has special responsibility for the resolution of commercial disputes. Mr. Speaker,

that is why we propose that this jurisdiction should henceforth be exercised by the

High Court of the country.

[Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), Volume 104 No. 10, 22nd March, 1996, 1174]

Hence the Commercial High Court was established to reduce the jurisdiction of the District

Court and vest exclusive jurisdiction over commercial matters in the Commercial High

Court with a view to provide speedy resolution to such disputes.

Page 5 of 12

Section 2(1) of the said Act reads:

Every High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province

shall, with effect from such date as the Minister may, by Order published in the

Gazette appoint, in respect of such High Court have exclusive jurisdiction and shall

have cognizance of and full power to hear and determine, in the manner provided

for by written law, all actions, applications and proceedings specified the First

Schedule to this Act, if the party or parties defendant to such action resides or

reside, or the cause a action has arisen, or the contract sought to be enforce was

made, or in the case of applications or proceeding under the Companies Act, No 17

of 1982 the registered office of the Company is situated, within the Province which

such High Court is established.

The jurisdiction so vested in the Commercial High Court has two components, namely:

(1) Subject Matter Jurisdiction

(2) Territorial Jurisdiction

The subject matter jurisdiction is set out in the First Schedule to the Act while the

territorial jurisdiction is set out in section 2(1) of the Act. The resulting jurisdiction is

rendered exclusively to the Commercial High Court.

The territorial jurisdiction depends upon where the party or parties defendant to such

action resides or reside, or the cause of action has arisen, or the contract sought to be

enforced was made, or in the case of applications or proceeding under the Companies

Act, No. 17 of 1982 the registered office of the Company is situated.

The matter before the Court does not involve the territorial jurisdiction of the Commercial

High Court. The only issue is its subject matter jurisdiction.

Page 6 of 12

Therefore, the decision in this case revolves around the interpretation to be given to Item

(1) of the first schedule to the Act which, as amended, reads as follows:

All actions where the cause of action has arisen out of commercial transactions

(including causes of action relating to banking, the export of merchandise, services

affreightment, insurance, mercantile agency, mercantile usage and the

construction of any mercantile document) in which the debt, damage or demand

is for a sum exceeding twenty million rupees or such other amount as may be fixed

by the Minister from time to time, by Notification published in the Gazette, other

than actions instituted under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of

1990.

The fundamental requirement for the Commercial High Court to have jurisdiction is that

the cause of action must have arisen out of a commercial transaction.

The learned counsel for the Respondent drew our attention to the decision of this Court

in D.A.D. Engineering (Pvt) Ltd. v. Subhasinghe (S.C. Appeal 45/2015, S.C.M. 15.12.2017]

where it was held that the jurisdiction assigned to the Commercial High Court is a special

jurisdiction and therefore the provisions of the Act will have to be strictly adhered to when

the Commercial High Court is exercising the jurisdiction conferred on it. I do not believe

the Court intended that the provisions of the Act should be interpreted narrowly.

On the contrary, the Court has consistently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial

High Court must be interpreted broadly [Cornel & Company Limited v. Mitsui and

Company Limited and Others [2000] 1 Sri.L.R. 57]. In Seneviratne and Another v. State

Bank of India [S.C. (C.H.C.) Appeal 53/2006, S.C.M. 17.12.2014] the Court held that the

term "commercial" should be interpreted in a broad sense having regard to the many

activities which are an integral part of banking and commerce.

Accordingly, in my view, the words cause of action has arisen out of commercial

transactions in Item (1) must be given a broad interpretation. It is further supported by

the use of the word "All".

Page 7 of 12

The genus of Item (1) is a commercial transaction. Item (1) sets out certain classes of cause

of actions which by definition falls within it. It is not intended to be comprehensive, as the

term used is "including". One such class of cause of action is cause of action relating to

banking. When the cause of action relates to banking, by definition it becomes a cause of

action arising out of commercial transactions.

The learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Commercial High Court is

vested with, what I refer to as subject matter jurisdiction, only where the cause of action

arises from a commercial transaction as set out in the Schedule to the Act i.e., cause of

action which arises pertaining to a contract. He further contended that in a delictual

action, the cause of action consists of three conditions, namely:

(1) The defendant owed a duty of care towards the plaintiff

(2) The defendant breached this duty of care negligently

(3) As a result, the plaintiff suffered damages

On this basis, he submitted that the action of the Respondent is not a commercial

transaction but delictual.

When examining the pleadings before the Court, the following facts appear to be

uncontested between the parties:

(1) Appellant maintained an account with the Respondent.

(2) From time-to-time money was transferred to and from this account.

(3) Somewhere in 2016, the Appellant instructed the Respondent to transfer a

certain sum of money from this account to the account of Passion Shipping

Company Limited maintained at Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong.

Admittedly the Appellants cause of is delictual. Nonetheless the right question is whether

the cause of action relates to banking and not whether the cause of action is delictual. In

answering this question Court will have to look not to the mere form, but to the grounds

of the plaint and to the media on which the plaintiff asks for judgment.

The Appellant claims that the instructions given as a customer to its bank, the

Respondent, was negligently breached in the transfer of funds from its account to the

account of Passion Shipping Company Limited maintained at Standard Chartered Bank,

Hong Kong.

The expression 'banking' embraces every transaction coming within the legitimate

business of a banker [Tennant vs. Union Bank of Canada (1894 AC 31)]. In Indian Bank vs.

Acuity Stock Brokers (Pvt) Limited [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 149 at 155-6] Suresh Chandra J. held:

There is no clear-cut demarcation of the transactions that one has with a Bank

being classified as Banking Transactions. It is usual to consider lodging money into

a bank account, withdrawing money, adding interest to an account, direct debits,

deducting bank charges, basically any sort of activity involving a change of money

in an account is a banking transaction which are usually listed in a bank account

statement.

Clearly the transaction upon which the Appellant bases its cause of action is a banking

transaction. The damages are claimed for breach of an alleged duty of care based on the

banker-customer relationship. Hence the media upon which the Appellant has instituted

this action is no doubt a banking transaction.

Applying the broader interpretation to Item (1), I hold that all causes of action relating to

banking in which the debt, damage or demand is for a sum exceeding twenty million

rupees or such other amount as may be fixed by the Minister from time to time, by

notification published in the Gazette, is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the

Commercial High Court except actions instituted under the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1990.

Accordingly, I hold that the cause of action of the Appellant is related to banking and falls

within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court.

This conclusion is supported by the incongruous consequences of upholding the

submissions of the Respondent.

Page 9 of 12

In terms of section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance No. 05 of 1852, in all questions or issues

which may hereafter arise or which may have to be decided in Sri Lanka with respect to

the law of banks and banking, the law to be administered shall be the same as would be

administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if such question or

issue had arisen or had to be decided in England, unless in any case other provision is or

shall be made by any enactment now in force in Sri Lanka or hereafter to be enacted.

In general, English law recognizes concurrent liability for breach of contract as well as tort.

According to Burrows on Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract (2nd Ed., page 4,

Butterworths, 1994), on the same facts and in relation to the same loss, the plaintiff may

be able to show not only that the defendant has broken his contract but also that he has

committed the tort of negligence. He goes on to state that (at page 5) if the standard of

liability is not more onerous, there should be in principle be no objection to the plaintiff

choosing to obtain judgment either for the breach of contract or for the tort of negligence,

depending on which is more favorable to him.

In Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. [(1995) 2 A.C. 145 at 193-4 (HL)] Lord Goff held:

..the common law is not antipathetic to concurrent liability, and that there is no

sound basis for a rule which automatically restricts the claimant to either a tortious

or a contractual remedy. The result may be untidy: but, given that the tortious duty

is imposed by the general law, and the contractual duty is attributable to the will

of the parties, I do not find it objectionable that the claimant may be entitled to

take advantage of the remedy which is most advantageous to him, subject only to

ascertaining whether the tortious duty is so inconsistent with the applicable

contract that, in accordance with ordinary principle, the parties must be taken to

have agreed that the tortious remedy is to be limited or excluded.

This general principle has been applied in relation to law of banking. Under English law,

there are many situations where a Bank is liable to its customer for breach of contract as

well as in tort.

Page 10 of 12

For example, in Barclays Bank plc v. Quincecare Ltd. and Another [(1992) 4 All ER 363 at

375-6] Steyn J. held:

Primarily, the relationship between a banker and customer is that of debtor and

creditor. But quoad the drawing and payment of the customers cheques as against

the money of the customers in the bankers hand the relationship is that of principle

and agent: see Westminister Bank Ltd v Hilton (1926) 43 TLR 124 at 126 per Lord

Atkinson. Similarly, when the bank in the present case acted on an order to transfer

by immediate money transfer money from Quincecare current account to Philip

Evans & Co in Bournemouth, the bank was acting as Quincecares agent. As agent

the bank owed fiduciary duties to Quincecare: see Bowstead on Agency (15th edn)

pp 156-160. Prima facie every agent for reward is also bound to exercise reasonable

care and skill in carrying out the instructions of his principal. Bowstead p 144. There

is no logical or sensible reason for holding that bankers are immune from such

elementary obligation. In my judgement it is an implied term of the contract

between the bank and the customer that the bank orders. Moreover,

notwithstanding what was said in Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank

Ltd [1985] 2 All ER 947 at 957, [1986] AC 80 at 107, a banker may in a case such as

present be sued in tort as well as in contract: See Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett

Stubbs & Kemp (a firm) [1978] 3 All ER 571, [1979] Ch 384. But the duties in contract

and tort are coextensive, and in the context of the present case nothing turns on

the question whether the case is approached as one in contract or tort.

Furthermore, according to Odgers on Pagets Law of Banking [15th Ed., page 662,

LexisNexis] wrongful dishonour of payment order will usually render the bank liable to the

customer for breach of contract, and it may also constitute the tort of libel.

Therefore, upholding the Respondent's submission creates uncertainty and confusion in

the way the system works. A customer who may have a cause of action for breach of

contract and a delictual claim against a bank relating to a banking transaction, will have

to institute action in the District Court if he chooses the delictual claim and in the

Commercial High Court if he chooses the breach of contract claim. The District Court

Page 11 of 12

action will provide for two appeals while the Commercial High Court action will provide

only for one appeal.

In Shannon Realties Ltd. v. Ville de St. Michel [(1924) A.C. 185, 192-3] it was held:

Where the words of a statute are clear they must, of course, be followed; but, on

their Lordships opinion, where alternative constructions are equally open, that

alternative is to be chosen which will be consistent with the smooth working of the

system which the statute purports to be regulating: and that alternative is to be

rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the working of

the system.

Moreover, the jurisdiction of the District Court will not be reduced in relation to

commercial matters as intended by the legislature. Instead of a speedy resolution of

commercial disputes, there will be a multiplicity of proceedings in both original and

appellate courts which runs contrary to the legislative intent.

For example. there may be banking transactions between a customer and a bank where

by contract the delictual liability of the bank is sought to be limited or avoided. Where the

customer seeks to sue on the delictual liability, he will have to institute an action in the

District Court. If the Bank wants to avoid delictual liability based on the contractual

stipulations that may have to be done in a separate action in the Commercial High Court

as any cross claim in the District Court action based on the exclusion of liability by

contractual terms will be a matter for the Commercial High Court according to the

Respondent.

For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law in the affirmative and set aside

the judgment of the Commercial High Court dated 19.12.2019.

I answer issue Nos. 8 as follows:
