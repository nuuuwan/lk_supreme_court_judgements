Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of Colombo

seeking a declaration of title to the property described in the

third schedule to the plaint, the ejectment of the Defendants

therefrom and damages. The Defendants sought the dismissal

of the Plaintiffs action and claimed prescriptive title to the

property. After trial, the District Court entered Judgment for the

Plaintiffs except damages. On appeal, the High Court of Civil

Appeal set aside the Judgment of the District Court and entered

Judgment for the Defendants. Hence this appeal by the

Plaintiffs.

Leave was granted by this Court on the question whether the

High Court erred in holding that the Defendants acquired

prescriptive title to the property within the meaning of section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871, as amended, on

the strength of the evidence adduced at the trial.

The property in suit is a condominium unit. The parties to the

case are close relations. The Power of Attorney holder who filed

this case is the father of the 2nd Plaintiff; the 1st Plaintiff is the

husband of the 2nd Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant is the uterine

sister of the 2nd Plaintiffs father; the 1st Defendant is the

husband of the 2nd Defendant.

The aforesaid Power of Attorney holder of the Plaintiffs was the

owner of the property by Deed P1 executed in 1994. He gifted

the property to his daughter, the 2nd Plaintiff, by Deed P2. It is

significant that Deeds P1 and P2 were not marked subject to

proof at the trial. Nor was an issue raised by the Defendants at

5

the trial disputing the Deeds. The Defendants do not have a

Deed to this property.

Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge seems to be

disputing Deed P1 on the basis that the consideration for P1 was

not paid by the transferee, the 2nd Plaintiffs father, to the

transferor (the owner of the condominium unit), but by the sister

of both the 2nd Plaintiffs father and the 2nd Defendant, who at

that time was living in the UK. This is clear by looking at the

answer given by the learned High Court Judge in the impugned

Judgment to issue No.1, which reads there can be

encumbrances or fetters in the alleged paper title of the

transferee of Deed P1 as the consideration was supplied by a

third party.

A Deed does not become invalid or less valid merely because

consideration was paid by a third party. There is no law that

consideration must be paid by the transferee personally. In this

case, the sister living in the UK, by P3 marked at the trial not

subject to proof, whilst stating the above property was bought

by my brother [the transferee of P1] and I provided him with

financial assistance to buy this property, expressly admits I am

fully aware that I have no legal right to this property. Therefore

the learned High Court Judge was erroneous to have held that

Deed P1 is subject to encumbrances or fetters.

Hence there is no difficulty in concluding that the Plaintiffs have

the paper title to the property.

In a vindicatory action, the initial burden is on the Plaintiff to

prove title to the property. If he fails to prove title, the Plaintiffs

action shall fail no matter how weak the case of the Defendant

6

is. However, once the paper title to the property is accepted by

the Defendant or proved by the Plaintiff, the burden shifts to the

Defendant to prove on what right he is in possession of the

property.

Let me add this for clarity. The right to possession and the right

to recover possession are essential attributes of ownership of

immovable property. The owner is entitled to these as of right.

The law does not require that the owner must possess his

property. That is his choice. He can either possess it or leave it

as it is. In simple terms, merely because the owner does not

possess the property, he does not lose ownership of the

property.

In Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva (1951) 52 NLR 289 the Privy

Council held: In an action for declaration of title to property,

where the legal title is in the Plaintiff but the property is in the

possession of the Defendant, the burden of proof is on the

Defendant. In Theivandran v. Ramanathan Chettiar [1986] 2 Sri

LR 219 at 222, Sharvananda C.J. stated: In a vindicatory action

the claimant need merely prove two facts; namely, that he is the

owner of the thing and that the thing to which he is entitled to

possession by virtue of his ownership is in the possession of the

Defendant. Basing his claim on his ownership, which entitles him

to possession, he may sue for the ejectment of any person in

possession of it without his consent. Hence when the legal title to

the premises is admitted or proved to be in the Plaintiff, the

burden of proof is on the Defendant to show that he is in lawful

possession. This was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva

C.J. in Beebi Johara v. Warusavithana [1998] 3 Sri LR 227 at 229

and reiterated in Candappa nee Bastian v. Ponnambalam Pillai

7

[1993] 1 Sri LR 184 at 187. Vide also Wijetunge v. Thangarajah

[1999] 1 Sri LR 53, Gunasekera v. Latiff (1999) 1 Sri LR 365 at

370, Jayasekera v. Bishop of Kandy [2002] 2 Sri LR 406 and

Loku Menika v. Gunasekera [1997] 2 Sri LR 281 at 282-283.

Let us now consider whether the Defendants discharged their

burden of proof. The Defendants did not make a claim in

reconvention in the prayer to the answer that they have acquired

prescriptive title to the property. But by issue No.13 raised at

the trial, they did claim prescriptive title to the property. This is

permissible in terms of section 146 of the Civil Procedure Code

which allows issues to be raised on matters where the parties

are at variance and the right decision of the case appears to the

Court to depend.

It is settled law that once issues are framed and accepted by

Court, the case of each party is crystallised in the issues and the

pleadings recede to the background. Thereafter the case is tried

and the parties marshal their evidence not on the pleadings but

on the issues. Practically, the Judgment is the answers to the

issues with reasons.

Issue No.13 raised by the Defendants reads as follows: Did the

1st and 2nd Defendants acquire prescriptive title [to the property]

from the day which they came into possession in the year 1995?

The year 1995 is significant as I will explain below. It cannot be

a mistake or typographical error as the same year is repeated in

issue No.10 raised by Defendants: Did the Defendants obtain

possession of the property from a third party in the year 1995?

Although the Defendants state in the answer that they came into

possession of the property in March 1994, they took up the clear

position by way of the issues that they came and commenced

8

prescriptive possession from 1995 (having taken possession of

the property from a third party). For whatever reason, this is

how the Defendants put their prescriptive claim in issue at the

trial. On the other hand, even if the Defendants pleaded in the

answer that they commenced prescriptive possession from 1995,

they could have (subject to objection by the Plaintiffs) raised an

issue that they commenced prescriptive possession from March

1994.

The above two issues were answered by the learned District

Judge in the negative and by the learned High Court Judge on

appeal in the affirmative in that the learned High Court Judge

states that the Defendants commenced prescriptive possession

not from 1995 but from March 1994. The answer to issue No.13

by the learned High Court Judge is as follows: The 1st and 2nd

Defendant Appellants have acquired prescriptive title from

continuous, uninterrupted, adverse and independent possession

from March 1994.

The Plaintiffs countered the prescriptive claim of the Defendants

on the premise that the Defendants were permitted to occupy

the house in order for the Defendants children to continue their

education in Colombo, as the Defendants were displaced during

the civil war in the North. It may be recalled that the transferee

of Deed P1 is the brother of the 2nd Defendant and the purchase

price of the house was paid, according to the Defendants, by

their sister in the UK. The learned High Court Judge in his

Judgment says the claim that the 2nd Plaintiffs father granted

leave and license to his sister, the 2nd Defendant, to stay in the

house is unsustainable because Deed P1 was executed on

01.12.1994 whereas the Defendants had come into occupation

9

of the house in March 1994 having obtained the keys to the

house from the vendors of Deed P1.

This approach of the learned High Court Judge is not

permissible given the issues raised by the Defendants at the trial

as quoted above. If I may repeat, the position taken up by the

Defendants at the trial as crystallised in the issues is that they

came and commenced prescriptive possession of the property

from 1995 and not from March 1994. Upon acceptance of the

issues, the position is that the 2nd Plaintiffs father became the

owner of the property by Deed P1 dated 01.12.1994, before the

Defendants came into possession of the house in 1995.

In the adversarial system of justice associated mainly with

common law jurisdictions, the case is decided by the Judge on a

competitive process between the Plaintiff and the Defendant

without the Judge himself taking part in the dispute.

Conversely, in the inquisitorial system of justice associated

mainly with civil law jurisdictions, the pre-trial in particular and

also the trial itself is, practically, an expedition presided over by

the Judge in pursuit of the truth. Notwithstanding that the goal

of both the adversarial and inquisitorial systems is the

ascertainment of the truth, the former seeks to attain it by

pitting the parties against one another, whereas the latter seeks

to attain the same by the Judges direct involvement in the

process. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages.

Sri Lanka is known to have a common law system (although

strictly speaking we have a mixed system with features of both

legal systems). The system of justice we practice here is

adversarial and not inquisitorial. Hence the Judge trying a case

shall be careful not to overstep his limits in the guise of due

10

administration of justice. The Judge shall decide the case as it

is presented before him by the two competing parties and not

based on his own conception of justice and injustice, unless

there is a compelling reason to deviate from the fundamental

principle.

It was held in Pathmawathie v. Jayasekara [1997] 1 Sri LR 248:

It must always be remembered by Judges that the system of civil

law that prevails in our country is confrontational and therefore

the jurisdiction of the Judge is circumscribed and limited to the

dispute presented to him for adjudication by the contesting

parties. Our civil law does not in any way permit the adjudicator

or judge the freedom of the wild ass to go on a voyage of

discovery and make findings as he pleases may be on what he

thinks is right or wrong, moral or immoral or what should be the

correct situation. The adjudicator or Judge is duty bound to

determine the dispute presented to him and his jurisdiction is

circumscribed by that dispute and no more.

The Supreme Court in Saravanamuthu v. Packiyam [2012] 1 Sri

LR 298 observed: It must be remembered that the jurisdiction of

the Court is limited to the dispute presented for adjudication by

the contesting parties.

Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva in Beebi v. Warusavithana [1998] 3

Sri LR 227 at 230-231 observed:

It must be noted that the proceedings before the District

Court were adversarial in character. The Court of Appeal

was in error when it placed a burden on the District Court

to make sure that inadequate information is not placed

before it. As a general proposition, it is no part of a

11

Judges duty in a civil action to fill in the deficiencies in a

case of one of the disputants by calling evidence on his

own. per Nihill, J. in Rewata Thero v. Horatala 14 CLW

155. Sections 150, 151 and 163 of the Civil Procedure Code

indicate that the burden is on each party to lead such

evidence as is necessary to establish his case or his

defence, having regard to the issues upon which the case

proceeds to trial.

In Bandaranaike v. Premadasa [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 369 at 384

Soza J. explained this in the following terms:

When we speak of the adversary or accusatorial system as

distinguished from the continental inquisitorial system, we

refer to a particular philosophy of adjudication whereby the

function of the counsel is kept distinct from that of the

Judge. It is the function of counsel to fight out his case

while the Judge keeps aloof from the thrust and parry of

the conflict. He acts merely as an impartial umpire to pass

upon objections, hold counsel to the rules of the game and

finally to select the victor. This common law contentious

procedure has its defects and has been criticised by jurists

like Roscoe Pound (see Landmarks of Law ed. Hensen-

Beacon series pp. 186, 187) but it is the Anglo American

system and prevails in India and Sri Lanka too. In fact the

Foster Advisory Committee in its Report on the English Civil

Procedure (1974) recommends the retention of the

adversary system of proceduresee the Stevens publication

of the reportchapter 5 paragraph 102 pp. 28, 29. This

system is built on the English notion of fair play and justice

where the Judge does not descend into the arena and so

12

jeopardise his impartiality. Under this system it is counsels

duty to prove the facts essential to his case with the other

party striving to disprove these facts or to establish an

affirmative defence.

Is it possible or believable that the Defendants obtained the keys

to the house quite independently from the transferor of Deed P1

(the owner of the condominium unit) when the transferee of the

Deed and the party who paid the consideration for the Deed

were very much alive and available? In my judgment, it is not.

There is no reason for the transferor to give the keys to the unit

to an outsider unless the transferee or the person who paid the

consideration for the Deed told the transferor to do so. No such

thing happened.

This conclusion is amply justified by P3, the letter of the 2nd

Defendants sister in the UK, marked not subject to proof. It

inter alia reads as follows:

This is to confirm that the above property was bought by

my brother Mr. Kanagasundaram Sathiakantham (the

father of the 2nd Plaintiff) in 1994. I provided him with

financial assistance to buy this property. I also confirm

that as our sister, Mrs. Srijeyathevi Devarajan [the 2nd

Defendant] was having problem with accommodation

during that time Mr. Sathiakantham agreed to let Mrs.

Devarajan and her family stay in the property without rent

so that her family can stay in Colombo until her children

complete their secondary school education.Mrs.

Devarajans children have completed their education,

currently in full time employment and are in better financial

position. Mrs. Devarajans family should therefore abide by

13

the agreement leave the above property and find their own

accommodation.

P3 amply corroborates the Plaintiffs version of events that the

Defendants came into possession of the house as licensees of

the transferee of Deed P1.

The learned High Court Judge accepts P3 but unfortunately

says: P3 was issued after the institution of the action; its maker

did not give evidence nor was she was cross-examined; its

contents were never verified; hence its evidentiary value is very

low. I am unable to agree. The maker of P3 is not a stranger

but the 2nd Defendants sister who, according to the 1st

Defendant, paid the purchase price to the vendor. Although the

letter was issued after the institution of the action, it speaks of

events anterior to the date of filing the action. This is what

witnesses do in the course of their evidence in Court. The maker

of P3 was not called as a witness because P3 was not marked

subject to proof. Had it been marked subject to proof, the

maker could have been called as a witness. It is naive to think

that in a civil case the parties shall call the makers of all marked

documents as witnesses in order to prove those documents

whether or not they are marked subject to proof.

In a civil case, if the opposing party disputes a document, he

must, at the time of marking the document, raise that objection

and, if necessary, make an application to Court to mark it

subject to proof. Otherwise, there is no necessity to call

witnesses to prove all marked documents. The explanation to

section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code reads: If the opposing

party does not, on the document being tendered in evidence,

object to it being received and if the document is not such as is

14

forbidden by law to be received in evidence, the Court should

admit it. This principle is applicable even to Deeds, irrespective

of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. (Siyadoris v. Danoris

(1841) 42 NLR 311, Silva v. Kindersly (1914) 18 NLR 85, Seyed

Mohomed v. Perera (1956) 58 NLR 246, Cinemas Ltd v.

Sounderarajan [1998] 2 Sri LR 16 at 18, Hemapala v. Abeyratne

[1978-79] 2 Sri LR 222, Wijeardena v. Ellawala [1991] 2 Sri LR 14

at 34-35, Kandasamy v. Sinnathamby [1985] 2 Sri LR 249 at 255)

What I have stated above shall not be taken to mean that all

documents the opposing party purportedly requires to be

marked subject to proof must necessarily be proved by calling

witnesses. There is a practice among some lawyers to get up

and say subject to proof whenever a document is marked in

evidence by the other party. This they do as a matter of course

or as a matter of routine and not with any particular objective in

mind, except perhaps to prolong the trial. It is regrettable that

most of the time the party who produces the document obliges

to this without a murmur. If we are serious about laws delays,

we must put an end to this bad practice. When a counsel

routinely says subject to proof, the Judge must ask what he

wants the other party to prove in the document. If this simple

question is asked, I am certain the objection would be

withdrawn or at least the issue to be addressed would be

narrowed down. On the other hand, if the document is, take for

instance, a Deed pleaded in the plaint but no issue has been

raised disputing the Deed, the Defendant cannot make a routine

application to mark it subject to proof when it is marked in

evidence. Against this backdrop, I must emphasise that the

Judge shall not mechanically refuse documents marked subject

to proof but not technically proved by calling witnesses. The

15

Judge shall decide the question of proof at the end of the trial on

the facts and circumstances of each individual case.

From the evidence adduced at the trial, it is clear that the

Defendants in this case came into possession of the house with

the leave and license of the transferee of Deed P1 (with the

acknowledgment of the sister who provided financial assistance

to purchase the property) and not as independent persons who

obtained the keys to the house from the transferors of Deed P1.

The Defendants position is that after they came into possession

in 1995 they continued to possess the property until 2012, in

which year the Plaintiffs disputed the possession of the

Defendants. The learned High Court Judge says the Defendants

possessed from March 1994 up to the institution of the action in

2013 as their own based on a title adverse and independent and

therefore are entitled to claim prescriptive title to the property as

provided in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Permissive possession, however long it may be, is not

prescriptive possession. For permissive possession to become

adverse possession in order to claim prescriptive possession,

there shall be cogent evidence. The Defendants who entered

into possession of the property in a subordinate character as

licensees are not entitled to commence adverse possession

against the owner by forming a secret intention in mind

unaccompanied by an overt act of ouster. The Defendants must

establish a clear starting point known to the owner in order for

the former to claim prescriptive possession against the latter.

The prescriptive period of ten years begins to run only from that

point and not from the date the Defendants came into

possession. (Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR 365, Reginald

16

Fernando v. Pabilinahamy [2005] 1 Sri LR 31 at 37, Chelliah Vs.

Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR 337 at 342, Mitrapala v. Tikonis

Singho [2005] 1 Sri LR 206 at 211-212, Seeman v. David [2000] 3

Sri LR 23 at 26, Madunawala v. Ekneligoda (1898) 3 NLR 213,

Navaratne v. Jayatunga (1943) 44 NLR 517, De Soysa v. Fonseka

(1957) 58 NLR 501)

When the relationship between the two parties is very close,

such as in the instant case, the overt act manifesting the

commencement of adverse possession and strong affirmative

evidence for the continuation of such adverse possession for

over ten years are all the more important to successfully claim

prescriptive title. (De Silva v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(1978) 80 NLR 292, Podihamy v. Elaris [1988] 2 Sri LR 129)

In the instant case, the Defendants have manifestly failed to

prove the commencement of adverse possession and the

continuance of it for over ten years. The proof of mere

possession of the property for over ten years does not satisfy the

requirements under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The possession shall be by a title adverse to or independent of

that of the claimant or Plaintiff in the action.

I answer the question upon which leave to appeal was granted in

favour of the Plaintiff-Appellants.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

restore the Judgment of the District Court and allow the appeal.

The Plaintiffs are entitled to costs in all three Courts.
