by Sudath Perera Associates for the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner.

Sanjeewa Ranaweera with Aruna de Silva instructed by Malaka

Palliyaguruge for the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

Argued on: 09 – 03 - 2021

Decided on: 07 - 07 - 2021

P Padman Surasena J

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent, filed an application in the Labour Tribunal

complaining that his service was unfairly terminated by the Respondent-Appellant-

Petitioner. He accordingly sought reinstatement with back wages, promotions and

other benefits or alternatively a reasonable compensation.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal, after inquiry, delivered her order dated

03-01-2018, awarding compensation to the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

holding that the termination of the service of the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

was unjustifiable.

Aggrieved by the above decision, the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner filed an appeal

in the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo.

The Provincial High Court, after argument of the said appeal, by its judgment dated

13-03-2020 affirmed the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and

dismissed the appeal subject to a cost of Rs. 10,000/=. The Provincial High Court held

that it has no basis to interfere with the order of the Labour Tribunal.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 4 of 16 Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Provincial High Court, the Respondent-

Appellant-Petitioner, by his Petition dated 17-07-2020 seeks Leave to Appeal from this

Court.

When this matter was taken up for support before this Court on 09-03-2021, the

learned Counsel for the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent raised a preliminary

objection against the maintainability of this application on the basis that the

application of the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner has been filed out of time provided

by Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules. The said Rule reads as follows.

“Every such application shall be made within six weeks of the order, judgement,

decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal in respect of which special leave to appeal

is sought.”

Thus, it was the submission of the learned Counsel for the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent that the instant application for leave to appeal was filed (on 17-07-2020),

after the lapse of the stipulated period of six weeks from the date of the judgment

against leave to appeal is sought. (i.e., as per Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules

1990).

The counter argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Respondent Appellant

Petitioner is that Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules has no application to the instant

application as it is an application for ‘Leave to Appeal’ from a judgment of the

Provincial High Court. It is his position that Rule 7 only applies to applications for

‘Special Leave to Appeal’ from any judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Thus, the pivotal issue to be decided in this case at this point, is the question whether

the period of six weeks prescribed in Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 applies

to the instant application which is an application to seek leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court, from a judgment of the Provincial High Court, filed under section 31

DD of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended).

The rules of this Court presently in force is ‘Supreme Court Rules 1990’. These Rules

are set out in Gazette No. 665/32 dated 7th June 1991. In its wider scope, the Supreme

Court Rules 1990 deals with procedures pertaining to several types of matters. These

are categorized under four parts. Part I has three sections named A, B and C. Section

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 5 of 16 A in Part I deals with applications seeking Special Leave to Appeal to appeal from

judgments of the Court of Appeal. Section B in Part I deals with instances where the

Court of Appeal has granted Leave to Appeal.

Section C in Part I deals with all the other appeals. Rule 28 (1) which is found in this

section (Section C in Part I) states thus;

“Save as otherwise specifically provided by or under any law passed by Parliament,

the provisions of this rule shall apply to all other appeals to the Supreme Court from

an order, judgment decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal or any other Court or

tribunal.1

As the instant application is an application filed under section 31 DD of the Industrial

Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), to seek leave to appeal to Supreme Court

from a judgment of the Provincial High Court, it is clear that it must fall under Section

C in Part I which deals with the ‘other appeals’. It cannot fall under section A in Part I

as it is not an application seeking Special Leave to Appeal from a judgment of the

Court of Appeal. It also cannot fall under section B in Part I as it is not an instance

where the Court of Appeal has granted Leave to Appeal.

For the sake of completely producing the scheme of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, I

would briefly set out the subjects dealt with, under the other parts as well, in the said

rules. Part II of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 deals with the General Provisions

Regarding Appeals and Applications. Part III of the said Rules deals with Stay of

Proceedings. Newly added Part III A of the said Rules deals with Applications to which

Public Officers are Respondents. Part IV of the said Rules deals with applications under

Article 126 of the Constitution.

One must remember that at the time the Supreme Court promulgated the Supreme

Court Rules 1990, Provincial High Court was not in existence. The Court of Appeal was

the major channel through which the appeals came to the Supreme Court at that time.

That was by way of Special Leave to Appeal Applications. That is the reason as to why

the Supreme Court Rules 1990 was designed in that way.

1 Emphasis added.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 6 of 16 However, with the promulgation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which

was certified on 14-11-1987, the Provincial High Courts with appellate powers were

established in the country. It was thereafter, that the Parliament enacted High Court

of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 and then Act No. 54 of 2006 which

enabled the Provincial High Court to hear Appeals from the lower Courts. It was those

two Acts which enabled any party aggrieved by a judgment pronounced by the

Provincial High Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction, to appeal to the Supreme

Court after obtaining leave. As the Supreme Court has not made any specific rules to

regulate this category of appeals, these appeals would fall under the category of ‘other

appeals’ in the existing Supreme Court Rules 1990.

However, one will not observe any specific time limit for preferring appeals under

Section C in Part I which deals with this category, namely ‘other appeals’. Despite the

absence of any rule prescribing the period within which an aggrieved party may prefer

such an appeal to the Supreme Court, this Court on several occasions, has adopted

the six weeks period mentioned in Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 as the

time limit for such appeals. I would henceforth advert to some of those occasions.

Tea Small Factories Ltd. Vs Weragoda and another.2 is an appeal filed in the Supreme

Court challenging the validity of the judgment pronounced by the Provincial High court

in the exercise of its appellate powers in respect of an order pronounced by the Labour

Tribunal. One of the grounds upon which the relevant appeal before the Supreme

Court was resisted, was the fact that the relevant Petition of Appeal in that case had

been filed out of time. Thus, that was an instance where this Court had to decide the

time limit within which such appeal should have been filed.

The learned Counsel who appeared for the 1st respondent in that case, relied on Rule

7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 and submitted that the application for special leave

to appeal in that case was filed on 24.09.92, after the lapse of the period prescribed

by the said rule, namely six weeks of the judgment in respect of which special leave

to appeal was sought.

2 1994 (3) SLR 353.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 7 of 16 The learned Counsel who appeared for the appellant in that case sought to counter

the above argument stating; that Rule 7 relied upon by the respondent in that case,

applies only to the applications for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the

Court of Appeal; that the judgment which is the subject of the said appeal is a

judgment of the High Court; that such appeals to the Supreme Court (specially

provided by s.31 DD of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended by Act No. 32 of 1990)

are governed by Rule 28 of the Supreme Court Rules; and that neither the section 31

DD nor Rule 28 of the Supreme Court Rules provides for the period within which an

aggrieved party may appeal to the Supreme Court.

Although, neither the section 31 DD nor Rule 28 of the Supreme Court Rules provides

for the period within which an aggrieved party may appeal to the Supreme Court, this

Court applied the provisions in Rule 7 and proceeded to calculate 6 weeks from the

date, the Provincial High Court pronounced the judgment impugned in that appeal.

Thus, despite the presence of the phrase “… within six weeks of the order, judgement,

decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal3…” in Rule 7, this Court chose to apply the

provisions in Rule 7 to the said appeal which is an appeal filed against the judgment

pronounced by the Provincial High court.

In the case of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Vs United Agency Construction (Pvt)

Ltd.4 the relevant arbitral award had been made in favour of the respondent in that

case. The said respondent therefore applied to the High Court for enforcement of the

said arbitral award. The High Court allowed the enforcement of the arbitral award.

The Petitioner in that application then made the application seeking leave to appeal

to appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court allowing the

enforcement of the arbitral award.

The Respondent in that application raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability

of that application on the basis that the said application had been filed out of time

prescribed by law. To counter the said preliminary objection, the petitioner in that

case contended that the Supreme Court has not made any rules under section 43 of

the Arbitration Act and therefore, there is no rule prescribing the period within which

3 Emphasis added. 4 2002 (1) SLR 8.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 8 of 16 an application for leave to appeal should be filed in the Supreme Court. He therefore

contended that any such application for leave to appeal could be filed in the Supreme

Court within a reasonable period and the Supreme Court should entertain such

application.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in that case further submitted that Rule 7 which

only referred to applications for special leave from judgments or orders of the Court

of Appeal had no applicability to applications for leave to appeal under section 37 (2)

of the Arbitration Act.

His Lordship Justice Edussuriya, upholding the preliminary objection of time bar raised

by the said respondent, stated as follows.

“The rules provide for a party seeking leave to appeal from a judgment or order of the

Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court to apply to the Court of Appeal for such leave

on a substantial question of law within twenty-one (21) days since the Court of Appeal

must make an order on such an application within twenty-one days or as set out in

the proviso to Rule 23 (5) and that if no order is made within that period the application

for leave is deemed to have been refused.

According to the rules a party may apply directly to the Supreme Court for special

leave to appeal within a period of forty-two (42) days of the judgment or order of the

Court of Appeal. So that it is seen that in providing for a period of forty-two days for

presenting an application for special leave the Supreme Court has allowed a party who

has been unsuccessful in his application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeal a

further period of twenty-one days within which an application for special leave can be

made.

In my view, the clear inference is that the Supreme Court in making the rules did not

consider it necessary to go beyond a maximum of forty-two days for making an

application for special leave to the Supreme Court. In deciding on these periods within

which such applications for leave to appeal should be made we must necessarily

conclude that the Supreme Court fixed such periods as it was of the view that such

periods were reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances, and also that the

Supreme Court acted reasonably in doing so. In this context, also relevant, would be

the question as to whether, in a situation where the appealable period from the Court

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 9 of 16 of Appeal to the Supreme Court is forty-two days, it is conceivable that the appealable

period from the High Court to the Supreme Court should be longer? If so, by how

many days?

For the above-mentioned reasons I hold that the period of fifty-five days from the

date of the order of the High Court taken by the petitioner to file his application for

leave to appeal cannot be considered to be a reasonable period and therefore uphold

the preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel for the respondent. I,

accordingly, reject this application for leave to appeal.”

In George Steuart & Company Limited Vs. Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantation Ltd,5

the arbitral tribunal had made an award against the petitioner in that application. The

respondent in that application applied to the High Court for enforcement of the said

arbitral award under section 31 (1) of the Arbitration Act. The High Court held that

the said respondent is entitled to recover the sum of money as awarded by the arbitral

tribunal. The Petitioner in that application then sought leave to appeal to appeal to

the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court allowing the enforcement of

the arbitral award.

The Respondent in that application raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability

of that application on the basis that the said application had been filed out of time

prescribed by law. The learned President’s Counsel who appeared for the respondent

in that case relied on the decision in the case of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka.6 The

learned President’s Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner in that case sought to

argue that the said decision7 is a decision made per incuriam.

Her Ladyship Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in rejecting the argument of the learned

President’s Counsel for the Petitioner in that case, stated as follows.

“It is to be remembered that direct applications for leave to appeal from the High

Court to the Supreme Court came in to being only after the 13th amendment to the

Constitution was enacted providing for the establishment of High Courts of Provinces.

5 2004 (1) SLR at page 246. 6 Supra. 7 The decision in the case of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 10 of 16 Prior to the enactment of the Arbitration Act and the establishment of the High Courts

of the Provinces, leave to appeal applications from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme

Court followed the procedure laid down in terms of the Rules of the Supreme Court.

Accordingly when a leave to appeal application is made to the Supreme Court, Rule

19(3) provides that it may be made in terms of Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules

1990. Rule 7 is in the following terms.

“Every such application shall be made within six weeks of the order, judgment,

decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal in respect of which special leave to appeal

is sought (emphasis added).”

When no provision is made in the relevant Act, specifying the time frame in which an

application for leave to appeal be made to the Supreme Court and simultaneously

when there are Rules providing for such situations, the appropriate procedure would

be to follow the current Rules which govern the leave to appeal applications to the

Supreme Court. Consequently such an application would have to be filed within 42

days from the date of the award.”

Samantha Kumara Vs Manohari,8 is an instance where the Respondent in that

application had claimed maintenance from the Appellant in that case, for the child

born out of wedlock. The Magistrate had ordered the said Respondent to pay a sum

of Rs. 750 per month as maintenance for the child. Being aggrieved by that order the

appellant in that case, had appealed to the High Court under Article 154 P of the

Constitution read with section 14 of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999. The High

Court had dismissed the appeal. The Appellant thereafter sought from the High Court,

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in terms of section 14(2) of Act No. 37 of 1999

read with section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990. The High Court granted leave on

06.06.2005. After leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been granted by the High

Court on 06.06.2005 the appellant, on 13.06.2005, has filed a petition of appeal

addressed to the Supreme Court in the Registry of the High Court. One of the

preliminary objections raised by the Respondent in that case, is that the Petitioner in

that case, after the High Court had granted leave, had not filed the petition of appeal

within the time as per the Rules.

8 2006 (2) SLR 57.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 11 of 16 This Court applied the provision in Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, in holding

that the 42 days is the time frame for an appeal to be filed when the High Court grants

leave to appeal, in respect of a decision made by such High Court in an appeal

preferred to it under the Maintenance Act.

His Lordship Justice Raja Fernando in his judgment stated as follows.

“The present Appeal is neither with special leave from the Supreme Court nor with

leave of the Court of Appeal but with leave from the High Court. Therefore the instant

appeal clearly falls into the category of other appeals and hence rules in Part 1C

dealing with other appeals would apply.

The position of the Appellant that there are no rules governing appeals from the

Provincial High Court to the Supreme Court is therefore incorrect.

An appeal to the Supreme Court from an order of the Provincial High Court can be

either with the leave of the Provincial High Court or with special leave obtained from

the Supreme Court upon a refusal of leave by the High Court.

If the appeal is with leave of the High Court, then Supreme Court rules under Part 1C

(other appeals) shall apply; if the appeal is with special leave of the Supreme Court

then Supreme Court rules under Part 1A (special leave to appeal) shall apply mutatis

mutandis since Rule 2 relates to every application for special leave to appeal......."

As regards the procedure in the instant case the rules applicable to other Appeals in

Part 1C of the Supreme Court rules shall apply.

A question arises in fixing the time within which the Appeal is to be filed in the Supreme

Court for the reason that the Rules are silent on the matter.

In determining the time for an aggrieved party to lodge an application for special leave

to the Supreme Court where no time is fixed either in the statute or the rules; this

Court has in the case of Tea Small Holders Limited vs. Weragoda9 and in the case of

Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka vs. United Agency Construction (Pvt.) Ltd.10 held that

the Petitioner should make his application within a reasonable time, and relying on

9 Supra. 10 Supra.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 12 of 16 the time period prescribed in the rules for similar applications has held that 42 days is

reasonable time.

Following the same reasoning I am of the view that the time frame for a petitioner to

file an appeal should be 42 days from the date leave to appeal is granted by the High

Court.”

The case of Priyanthi Chandrika Jinadasa Vs Pathma Hemamali and four others,11 is

an application for leave to appeal filed in this Court, seeking leave to appeal against a

judgment of the Provincial High Court exercising civil appellate jurisdiction. The

respondents in that case raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the

case on the basis that the said application had been filed 06 weeks after the date of

the impugned judgment.

The petitioner took up the position that the time limit of six weeks would not be

applicable to that application since that is an application for leave to appeal from the

judgment of the High Court. The petitioner contended that since there are no Rules

specifying a time limit for applications for leave to appeal from the judgment of the

Provincial High Courts exercising civil appellate jurisdiction, the concept that

applications must be filed within 'a reasonable time' (as opposed to six weeks’ time)

must be adopted.

Having considered the relevant arguments, Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake

CJ stated the following, when holding that the said application falls under section C in

Part I of Supreme Court Rules.

“In terms of Rule 7, it is quite clear that any application for special leave to appeal

should be made within six weeks from the order, judgment, decree or sentence of the

Court of Appeal on which such leave is sought.

It is however to be borne in mind that the said Rule 7 deals only with applications for

special leave to appeal from the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the present

application for leave to appeal is from a judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of

the Western Province holden at Gampaha.

11 2011 (1) SLR 337.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 13 of 16 As stated earlier categories B and C of Part I of the Supreme Court Rules, 1990 deal

with leave to appeal and other appeals, respectively. Whilst the category of leave to

appeal deals with instances, where Court of Appeal had granted leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court, other appeals refer to all other appeals to the Supreme Court from an

order, judgment, decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal or any other Court or

tribunal. Thus, it is evident that the present application for leave to appeal from the

judgment of the High Court of the Western Province (Civil Appeal) holden at Gampaha

would come under the said category C. ….”

Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake CJ then proceeded to consider whether such

an application must be filed within six weeks from the impugned judgment, as per

Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990. The following excerpt from Her Ladyship’s

judgment would be relevant.

“Direct applications for leave to appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court

came into being only after the establishment of High Courts of the Provinces. Until

such time, according to the procedure that prevailed, such applications were preferred

from the order, judgment, decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal. In such

circumstances, if the Court of Appeal had not granted leave to appeal, an application

could be made to the Supreme Court for special leave to appeal. Rules 19 and 20 of

the Supreme Court Rules refer to this position and Rule 20(3) in particular, deals with

the time frame in such applications. The said Rule 20(3) is as follows:

"Where the Court of Appeal does not grant or refuses to grant leave to appeal, an

application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court may be made in terms of

Rule 7."

Rule 7 clearly states that every such application shall be made within six weeks of the

order, judgment, decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal in respect of which special

leave to appeal is sought.

Accordingly it is quite clear that a litigant, who is dissatisfied with the decree of a

criminal matter, which had come before the High Courts (Civil Appellate) of the

Provinces would have to prefer an application before the Supreme Court within six (6)

weeks of the order, judgment, decree or sentence in question.”

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 14 of 16 In Karunawathie Wickremasinghe Samaranayake v Ranjani Warnakulasuriya,12 the

only question arose was whether that application which sought leave to appeal from

a judgment of the Provincial High Court exercising civil appellate jurisdiction, had been

lodged out of permissible time. This was because the respondent in that case raised

a preliminary objection in regard to the maintainability of that case on the basis that

the said application had not been filed within “06 weeks” (42 days) specified in Rule

7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990.

The petitioner took up the position that the time limit of six weeks, specified in Rule

7, which is in Section A in Part I of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, has no application

to an application seeking leave to appeal made under section 5 C (1) of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 54 of 2006, as the Supreme Court has

not made any rule dealing expressly with the time limit for applications for leave to

appeal from the High Court of the Province exercising civil appellate jurisdiction.

His Lordship Justice Saleem Marsoof PC having referred to the relevant previous

decisions of this Court, stated as follows.

“Accordingly in the light of the reasoning adopted in the aforementioned decisions of

this Court, I am inclined to hold that an application for leave to appeal filed in the

Supreme Court from an order of a High Court of the Province exercising civil

jurisdiction has to be filed within six weeks of the pronouncement of the order or

judgement appealed from, irrespective of whether it is considered to fall within Part

I-A or Part I-C of the Supreme Court Rules.”

In the case of Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Vs. Million Garment (Pvt) Ltd,13 the

Supreme Court was called upon to decide on the time limit for filing applications for

leave to appeal under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act. The learned counsel who

appeared for the respondent in that case, raised a preliminary objection stating that

the application for leave to appeal was time-barred as the judgment of the High Court

was pronounced on 14th May 2012, and the application for leave to appeal was lodged

in the registry of this Court on 26th June 2012 (on the forty-third day after the

pronouncement of the impugned judgment). He therefore argued that the petitioner

12 SC HC/CA/LA No. 137/2010, decided on 04-10-2012. 13 SC/HC/LA/58/2012, decided on 24-10-2014.

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 15 of 16 in that case had filed the said application for leave to appeal outside the time limit

prescribed by law, for filing of such applications. His Lordship Justice Saleem Marsoof

PC, having considered; firstly, the fact that section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act which

confers the right to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court by way of an

application for leave to appeal, does not specify any time limit for the lodging of the

application seeking leave to appeal; and secondly, the fact that no rules have so far

been made by this Court in terms of Section 43(a) of the Arbitration Act prescribing

any period of time within which any application for leave to appeal against any order,

judgment or decree of the High Court may be lodged; stated as follows.

“….The application filed by the Petitioner is of course for leave to appeal against a

decision of the High Court, and It is in these circumstances that learned President’s

Counsel for the Respondent has submitted that despite the absence of any express

provision in the Arbitration Act or any rule made under Section 43(a) of the said Act,

it would be reasonable to regard the six weeks period that is prescribed in Rule 7 of

the Supreme Court Rules, 1990 for the filing of an application seeking special leave to

appeal against an order or judgment of the Court of Appeal as being applicable to any

application seeking leave to appeal under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act. Learned

President’s Counsel has referred to the decisions of this Court in Tea Small Factories

Ltd. v Weragoda (1994) 3 SLR 353, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka v United Agency

Construction (2002) 1 SLR 8, George Stuart & Co. Ltd. v Lankem Tea & Rubber

Plantations Ltd. (2004) 1 SLR 246 Priyanthi Chandrika Jinadasa v Pathma Hemamali

(2011) 1 SLR 337, and Karunawathie Wickremesinghe Samaranayake v Ranjanie

Warnakulasuriya SC HC/CA/LA No. 137/2010 SC Minutes of 4.10.2012 (unreported) in

support of his submission that the application of the Petitioner in the instance case is

time-barred.”

Thus, in the instant case, notwithstanding the fact that the instant application for leave

to appeal from the judgment of the Provincial High Court would come under section

C in Part I namely ‘Other Appeals’, the provisions in Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules

1990 would apply to decide the time frame within which such an application must be

filed before this Court.

The judgment, of the Provincial High Court in respect of which leave to appeal is

sought, was delivered on 13-03-2020. The instant application seeking leave to appeal

(SC HC LA 50/2020) - Page 16 of 16 from the said judgment of the Provincial High Court, has been filed on 17-07-2020.

However, as per the Supreme Court (Temporary Provisions) Rules 2020,14 the period

beginning from 16-03-2020 and ending on 18-05- 2020 shall not be taken into account

in computing the period of six weeks referred to in the afore-said rule 7. Accordingly,

when the period from 16-03-2020 to 18-05-2020 is excluded, the Respondent-

Appellant-Petitioner has filed the instant application on the 62nd day from the date of

the judgment of the Provincial High Court in respect of which leave to appeal is sought.

Thus, the submission of the learned Counsel for the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent that the instant application for leave to appeal has been filed after the

lapse of the stipulated period of six weeks, from the date of the judgment is entitled

to succeed.

Therefore, I uphold the Preliminary Objection raised by the learned Counsel for the

Applicant-Respondent-Respondent. I refuse the application seeking leave to appeal.

The application must stand dismissed.
