Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff-1st Respondent, Viacom International Inc. (Plaintiff),

filed an appeal by way of a plaint dated 11.08.1998 before the

Commercial High Court in terms of section 182 of the Code of

Intellectual Property Act, No. 52 of 1979, against the order of the

Director of Intellectual Property dated 30.06.1998, made after an

inquiry held under section 107(13) of the Code. By this order,

the Director of Intellectual Property decided to register Mark No.

61332 of the 1st Defendant-Appellant, The Maharaja

Organisation Limited (1st Defendant), despite opposition by the

Plaintiff.

The Commercial High Court issued summons on the 1st

Defendant but the 1st Defendant did not respond compelling the

Court to take up the appeal ex parte. After the ex parte inquiry

into the merits of the appeal, the Commercial High Court

dismissed the Plaintiffs appeal by Judgment dated 13.09.1999.

The Plaintiff appealed against that Judgment to the Supreme

Court (SC/APPEAL/40/1999). Before the Supreme Court, the

Plaintiff objected to the 1st Defendant participating in the appeal

4

as the proceedings had been taken up ex parte against the 1st

Defendant in the lower Court. However the parties later agreed

before the Supreme Court, as reflected in that Judgment, that

the objection to the participation of the 1st Defendant in the

appeal be considered with the main appeal and that the parties

would tender written submissions and further the Court could

make its order on the written submissions of the parties.

Both parties filed written submissions before the Supreme Court

and by Judgment dated 28.04.2005, which is now reported as

Viacom International Inc. v. Maharaja Organisation Ltd [2006] 1

Sri LR 140, the Supreme Court set aside the Judgment of the

Commercial High Court dated 13th September 1999 and also set

aside the order of the 2nd Defendant dated 30th June 1998

allowing the 1st Defendant to register Trade Mark No. 61332.

Thereafter the 1st Defendant by motion dated 10.06.2005 made

an unusual application to the Commercial High Court stating

that it has now become necessary to proceed with this case in

view of the pronouncement of the Supreme Court Judgment in that

the Defendant could file papers to set aside the ex parte decree as

the Defendant is in law entitled to do.

The Commercial High Court by order dated 10.11.2005 rejected

the said application of the 1st Defendant. It is against this order

of the Commercial High Court dated 10.11.2005 that the 1st

Defendant has filed this final appeal.

At the argument before this Court, learned Presidents Counsel

for both parties invited the Court to decide the matter on written

submissions.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff, drawing attention

to the Full Bench decision of this Court in Chettiar v. Chettiar

[2011] BLR 25, [2011] 2 Sri LR 70, submits that this appeal of the

1st Defendant from the order of the Commercial High Court

dated 10.11.2005 shall be dismissed in limine as it is

misconceived in law in that the 1st Defendant should have come

before this Court against the order of the Commercial High

Court not by way of a final appeal under section 754(1) read

with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code and sections 5

and 6 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 10 of 1996, but with the leave of this Court first had and

obtained, i.e. by way of a leave to appeal application made under

section 754(2) read with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure

Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

Although learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff has

stressed this point in his written submissions filed both before

and after the argument, learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st

Defendant has refrained from addressing this matter in his

written submissions.

Let me first reproduce sections 754(1), (2) and (5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996:

754 (1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment,

pronounced by any original court in any civil action,

proceeding or matter to which he is a party may prefer an

appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for

any error in fact or in law.

6

(2) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order

made by any original court in the course of any civil action,

proceeding or matter to which he is, or seeks to be a party,

may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such

order for the correction of any error in fact or in law, with

the leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

Ordinance, for the purposes of this chapter

Judgment means any judgment or order having the effect of

a final judgment made by any civil court; and

Order means the final expression of any decision in any

civil action, proceeding or matter, which is not a judgment.

Sections 5 and 6 of Act No. 10 of 1996 whereby the Commercial

High Court was established read as follows:

(5) (1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgement

pronounced by a High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

section 2, in any action, proceeding or matter to which such

person is a party may prefer an appeal to the Supreme

Court against such judgement, for any error in fact or in

law.

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by

a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section

2, in the course of any action, proceeding or matter to which

such person is, or seeks to be, a party, may prefer an

appeal to the Supreme Court against such order for the

7

correction of any error in fact or in law, with the leave of the

Supreme Court first had and obtained.

(3) In this section, the expressions judgement and order

shall have the same meanings respectively, as in section

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

(6) Every appeal to the Supreme Court, and every application

for leave to appeal under section 5 shall be made as nearly

as may be in accordance with the procedure prescribed by

Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

The question whether an appeal or a leave to appeal lies against

an order of the District Court or Commercial High Court was a

subject of much controversy for a long period of time. There

were two approaches: the order approach and the application

approach.

In the Supreme Court case of Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd

[1984] 1 Sri LR 286, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) followed the

order approach adopted by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Bozson v.

Altrincham Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547.

Conversely, in the Supreme Court case of Ranjit v.

Kusumawathie [1998] 3 Sri LR 232, Dheeraratne J. followed the

application approach adopted by Lord Esher M.R. in Salaman v.

Warner [1891] 1 QB 734 and Lord Denning M.R. in Salter Rex &

Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597.

The order approach contemplates only the nature of the order.

When taken in isolation, if the order finally disposes of the

matter and the parties rights in litigation without leaving the

8

suit alive, the order is final and a direct/final appeal is the

proper remedy against such order.

The application approach contemplates only the nature of the

application made to Court, not the order delivered per se. In

accordance with this approach, if the order given in one way will

finally dispose of the matter in litigation, but if given in the other

way will allow the action to continue, the order is not final but

interlocutory, in which event, leave to appeal is the proper

remedy. In other words, according to the application approach,

if the order, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally

determine the matter in litigation, the order is final.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court (comprising five Justices)

was called upon to decide on this vexed question in Chettiar v.

Chettiar [2011] 2 Sri LR 70 and [2011] BLR 25. The Court,

having discussed both approaches stemming from English

decisions, unanimously decided that the application approach

(as opposed to the order approach) shall be the criterion in

deciding whether appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy

against an order of the District Court or Commercial High Court.

This Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court was consistently

followed in later Supreme Court decisions. (Yogendra v.

Tharmaratnam (SC/Appeal/87/2009, Supreme Court Minutes of

06.07.2011), Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC/Appeal/03/2009,

Supreme Court Minutes of 16.03.2012), Prof. I.K. Perera v. Prof.

Dayananda Somasundara (SC/Appeal/152/2010, Supreme

Court Minutes of 17.03.2011)

However, notwithstanding this was a Full Bench decision of the

Supreme Court, there were lingering doubts about the

9

correctness of the decision. Therefore, in Priyanthi Senanayake

v. Chamika Jayantha [2017] BLR 74, a Fuller Bench of the

Supreme Court (comprising seven Justices) revisited the

decision in Chettiars case. Eventually, the Fuller Bench also

reached the same conclusion, i.e. the test to be applied is the

application approach and not the order approach.

Chief Justice Dep (with the concurrence of the other six Justices

of the Supreme Court) held:

In order to decide whether an order is a final judgment or

not, it is my considered view that the proper approach is the

approach adopted by Lord Esher in Salamam v. Warner

[1891] 1 QB 734, which was cited with approval by Lord

Denning in Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597. It

stated: If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it

stands, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that

for that purpose of these Rules it is final. On the other

hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally

dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other,

will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

It is abundantly clear that an appeal does not lie against the

impugned order of the Commercial High Court whereby the

Commercial High Court only rejected the application of the 1st

Defendant made by way of a motion to allow the 1st Defendant to

file papers to set aside the ex parte decree. There is no necessity

to apply the decision in Chettiars case to this case. The order of

the Commercial High Court is prima facie interlocutory and not

final.

10

At the time of the impugned order, the Supreme Court had

already delivered the final Judgment on the merits of the case.

But let us assume that the rights of the parties had not been

decided by the Supreme Court at that time. Then, if the

Commercial High Court allowed the application of the 1st

Defendant to file papers to set aside the ex parte decree, the case

would not have ended there but would have continued. When

applying the application approach, it is crystal clear that there is

no right of appeal against the impugned order and hence the

final appeal filed by the Petitioner is misconceived in law.

The Petitioner should have come before this Court against the

order of the Commercial High Court not by way of a final appeal

made under section 754(1) read with section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996, but by way of

a leave to appeal application made under section 754(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code read with section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code and sections 5 and 6 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

Although no submission was made on behalf of the 1st

Defendant on the applicability of Chettiars Judgment to the

facts of this case, perhaps for obvious reasons, let me add the

following to clear any doubt.

Chettiars case was decided on 10.06.2010. There was a doubt

about the applicability of this Judgment to final appeals filed

against orders of the District Court and Commercial High Court

pronounced prior to 10.06.2010. This matter, i.e. whether

Chettiars Judgment had retrospective effect, was specifically

raised as a question of law when the decision in Chettiars case

11

was revisited by the Seven Judge Bench of this Court in

Priyanthi Senanayake v. Chamika Jayantha [2017] BLR 74.

However, the Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court did not

even think it fit to grant leave on this question. The Court only

granted leave to appeal to revisit the Five Judge Bench decision

in Chettiars case. Two appeals were amalgamated before the

Seven Judge Bench. In both appeals, the Plaintiffs cases had

been dismissed by the Trial Courts (one by the District Court

and the other by the Commercial High Court) on preliminary

objections taken up by the Defendants. In both appeals, the

impugned orders had been made and final appeals filed long

before Chettiars case was decided. Despite submissions on this

point before the Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, the

Court dismissed the appeals on the basis that the Plaintiffs

should have filed leave to appeal applications and not final

appeals against the impugned orders.

I must state that this is not an application of Chettiars

Judgment retrospectively. By Chettiars Judgment, the Supreme

Court did not make new law. It only declared what has always

been the law. The task of the Court is jus dicere (to say what the

law is) and not jus dare (to make the law). The doctrine of

separation of powers is in harmony with this view. This is

sometimes known as the declaratory theory of law: that judges

do not make the law but only declare what it has always been.

Because the law pre-exists the decision, the question of

retrospective or retroactive application does not arise.

Let me add one more point in connection with Chettiars

Judgment. It was held by a Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court

(comprising seven Justices) in Iranganie De Silva v. Indralatha

12

[2017] BLR 68 that when the language of a statute is clear and

the right of appeal is given in express terms, such as in section

88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, which enacts The order

setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon

default shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon

the facts and specifying the grounds upon which it is made, and

shall be liable to an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision

in Chettiars case has no application.

The preliminary objection raised by the Plaintiff in the instant

appeal cannot be disregarded as a mere technicality. It goes to

the root of the 1st Defendants appeal. I uphold the preliminary

objection and dismiss the appeal with costs.
