The 1st Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (later substituted by the

1A Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent) and the 2nd Plaintiff-Appellant-

Respondent, instituted a Rei Vindicatio action before the District Court

of Kuliyapitiya in May 2003, against the Defendant-Respondent-

Appellant (later substituted by 1A-D Defendant-Respondent-

Appellants; hereinafter referred to as the “Defendant”), seeking a

declaration of title to the land and to the building covering an extent of

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

4

747 square feet, (described as a Kada Kamaraya) standing thereon,

morefully described in the schedules A and B of the plaint, and also the

eviction of the Defendant therefrom. The Defendant, in his answer,

seeking the dismissal of the plaint, had also laid down a claim of

acquisition of prescriptive title to the said building and to the land on

which it stood.

Therefore, dispute that had been presented by the parties for

determination of the trial Court could be narrowed down to the

question as to who has the right to own the said ‘Kada Kamaraya’ and

the parcel of land on which it stands, situated within a land in extent of

one acre and 29 perches, described in schedule “w” of the plaint.

The Plaintiffs have claimed that they have the paper title to the

land described in schedule “w” and produced the relevant deeds before

the trial Court. On 17.05.1978, the 1st Plaintiff’s father had leased out the

said land in its entirety, including the building standing on it to one

Karunatilleke for a period of 15 years. It is alleged by the Plaintiffs in

their plaint that the Defendant had entered the said building illegally

within the one-year period commencing from 17.05.1978, during which

they have lost possession of their land temporarily. The lessee did not

vacate from the land and the building at the expiry of the 15-year lease

period, and had to be evicted by the fiscal, upon a writ of execution

issued by Court in case No. 10741/L, an action instituted by the

Plaintiffs seeking declaration of title and eviction of the said lessee. The

fiscal, in execution of the writ, had placed the Plaintiffs back into

possession of their land and only to the section of the building occupied

by the overholding lessee, leaving out the remaining part of it,

apparently on the claim that the Defendant’s grandfather Balin

Appuhamy had constructed the said Kada Kamaraya.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

5

The Plaintiffs have thereafter instituted action on 21.08.2001, in

case No. 13005/L and thereby sought to evict the Defendant from the

said Kada Kamaraya, but had withdrawn it on 01.08.2002, reserving their

right to re-institute proceedings. The Plaintiffs have thereafter instituted

the instant action on 20.02.2003, seeking declaration of title to the land

inclusive of the Kada Kamaraya and eviction of the Defendant.

The Defendant, in support of his claim of acquisition of

prescriptive title to the Kada Kamaraya he possessed, asserted

uninterrupted and long adverse possession. He also had taken up the

position that the present dispute is Res Judicata among the parties,

relying upon the dismissal of the earlier case No. 13005/L filed against

him.

At the commencement of the trial before the District Court, the

Defendant had suggested two issues (Nos. 12 and 13) particularly to the

effect that whether he had conferred with title to the disputed “parcel of

land” (idam kebella) upon the deed No. 12182 of 08.09.2003 (marked as

“P14”) and, whether he, along with Balin Appuhamy, had possessed the

said kada kamaraya and the parcel of land covered under it for over 10

years, prior to the institution of the instant action. At a subsequent stage

of the proceedings, the Defendant had suggested yet another issue (No.

17), whether the pleadings and the judgment of case No. 13005/L, are

Res Judicata among the parties.

The trial Court, having considered the material presented before

it, decided issue No. 17 in favour of the Defendant and dismissed the

Plaintiff’s action.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the Plaintiffs have

preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal in appeal No.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

6

NWP/HCCA/Kur/34/2009(F). The High Court of Civil Appeal, by its

judgment on 28.04.2014 answered the said issue No. 17 as “not proved”.

The appellate Court, having concluded that the Defendant failed to

establish that he had acquired prescriptive title to the Kada Kamaraya

and to the land on which it stands, proceeded to answer issue Nos. 12

and 13 also as “not proved” and allowed the appeal of the Plaintiffs.

With the pronouncement of the judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal, the Defendant thereafter sought Leave to Appeal from

this Court on several questions of law that had been formulated and

inserted in paragraph 8 of his petition.

This Court, after hearing Counsel on 12.07.2016, granted leave

only on the question of law, “did the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal err in failing to consider the prescriptive title of the Defendant

and his grandfather Balin Appuhamy? “

At that stage, learned President’s Counsel for the Respondent,

raised the following consequential issues of law.

1. Is the Petitioner entitled to challenge the issue of

prescription as he has failed to appeal against the

Judgement of the District Court with regard to

the issues raised by the Defendant in respect of

prescription?

2. The Defendant is also not entitled to raise on the

question of prescription in these proceedings as

he has failed to challenge the issue pertaining to

prescription in terms of section 772 of the Civil

Procedure Code?

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

7

3. In any event, the Defendant is not entitled to

claim prescription as much as his claim in the

District Court was only with regard to a room of

a building and not with regard to a land?

In support of the appeal, learned Counsel for the Defendant

contended before this Court that the High Court of Civil Appeal misled

itself and thereupon had fallen into error when it answered issue No.

13, raised on the acquisition of prescriptive title, as “not proved” by

attributing its reason, to his failure to present the deed P14, on which he

had relied on in establishing the said issue. Learned Counsel also

pointed out that the Defendant, in his answer, had taken up the position

that Balin Appuhamy was in occupation of the disputed Kada Kamaraya

for well over ten years prior to the institution of the instant action, and,

in addition, presented a substantial body of evidence before the trial

Court, which clearly indicate the position that since coming into

possession of the said Kada Kamaraya, it was unaccompanied by any

payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty or any

other act by him from which an acknowledgement of a right existing in

the Plaintiff could be inferred with.

In support of this contention, learned Counsel relied on the

statement made by the Plaintiffs in their plaint that the Defendant came

into “illegal” occupation of the disputed building prior to May 1978 and

was in possession of the said Kada Kamaraya since that point of time

onwards denying the title of the Plaintiffs over it. He added that the

character of the Defendant, when coming into occupation of the said

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

8

building was not of a licensee, who had entered the premises with leave

and license of the Plaintiffs and thereby acknowledging the rights of the

Plaintiffs over that premises, but as a trespasser, who did not recognize

any property rights of them over the said premises.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant sought to strengthen his

argument further by adverting to the failure of the Plaintiffs to take

steps to evict the Defendant along with the overholding lessee on

09.06.2001, in spite of the fact that he too was in the occupation of the

disputed building at the time of the execution of the writ. Since then,

and until the institution of the instant action in 2003, the Defendant was

in possession of the said building and thus uninterruptedly maintained

his title, adverse to or independent of that of the Plaintiffs, for well over

two decades and therefore clearly acquired prescriptive right over the

disputed building. It was also contended by the Defendant, that the trial

Court, having considered the evidence and in dismissing the Plaintiffs’

action, had arrived at a conclusive finding of fact that the Defendant

had possessed and continued to be in possession of the disputed

premises over a long period.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiffs, in resisting the

appeal of the Defendant, submitted that the trial Court, having arrived

at a finding that the Defendant was in possession for over long period

of time either “legally or illegally”; nonetheless, had proceeded to

answer the issue Nos. 12 and 13, suggested by the Defendant over his

claim of acquisition of prescriptive title, as “does not arise for

consideration” since the matter is Res Judicata among parties. Learned

President’s Counsel highlighted the fact that the Defendant did not

prefer an appeal against the said specific findings on those pivotal

issues nor has he made any application under section 722 of the Civil

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

9

Procedure Code contesting them, although the law had specifically

provided for such a course of action. His contention, therefore, is that

the Defendant cannot reagitate the issue of prescription before this

Court.

I shall now proceed to consider these submissions against the

backdrop of the evidence that had been placed before the trial Court

and the reasoning contained in the judgments of the Courts below.

It is evident from the judgement of the District Court, in

dismissing the Plaintiff’s action, it was of the view that an identical

cause of action had already been decided by that Court, in case No.

10741/L (referring to the first case instituted by the Plaintiffs against the

Defendant for his eviction) and its appeal was pending determination

before the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the trial Court decided that the

matter is Res Judicata among the parties. The reasoning of the trial

Court, adopted in arriving at that conclusion, also indicate that it

considered the failure of the Plaintiff to evict the Defendant along with

the overholding lessee from the building at the time of executing the

writ, despite the fact that the Court order was for the entirety of the

land, as a factor indicative of the renunciation of their rights over that

part of the building by the Plaintiffs.

In exercising its appellate jurisdiction, the High Court of Civil

Appeal has held that the trial Court was in error, when it answered the

issue No. 17 that the matter is Res Judicata among parties. The High

Court had thereupon proceeded to allow the Plaintiffs’ appeal by

holding that the “defendant has not also proved what is stated in issue No.

13, the alleged prescriptive title of Balin Appuhamy” and the deed of gift

P14, in relation to issue No. 12.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

10

The only question of law, upon which this Court had granted

leave to the Defendant to proceed with his appeal against the judgment

of the High Court of Civil Appeal, read “Did the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeal err in failing to consider the prescriptive title of the Defendant and

his grandfather Balin Appuhamy?”. In view of the limited scope of the

question of law on which leave was granted, learned Counsel had

understandably confined his challenge to the impugned judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal, only on the basis that it had failed to

consider the evidence available on the acquisition of prescriptive title by

Balin Appuhamy.

The quotation from the judgment of the trial Court, inserted in

the preceding paragraph of this judgment, clearly indicate that the High

Court of Civil Appeal, before arriving at the said impugned conclusion,

did in fact consider the issue of acquisition of prescriptive title after

evaluation of the evidence presented before the trial Court. The

appellate Court also had added that “… the Defendant has not been able to

show any right or title that would allow him to remain in that property …”.

One of the consequential questions of law, as formulated by the

learned President’s Counsel, too is connected to the issue of acquisition

of prescriptive title as it has been formulated to read “in any event, the

Defendant is not entitled to claim prescription as much as his claim in the

District Court was only with regard to a room of a building and not with

regard to a land?”.

In view of the scope of the area covered under the above

questions of law, it is necessary for this Court to consider same within

that defined area, in the light of the applicable principles of law and in

reference to the evidence that had been presented before the trial Court.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

11

The dispute among the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, as already

noted, is the right to own the Kada Kamaraya, and the portion of land

covered under that building. The 1st Plaintiff claims paper title to the

said land, over which the said building was erected on, based upon the

deed of transfer No. 18705 of 14.09.1975, executed in his favour by his

father Mallawa Arachchige Kiri Banda, the original owner. The said land

is depicted in Plan No. 65A/L.R.C. Ku 15/Ku. 14.

The 1st Plaintiff had leased out the said land with its building to

one Wickramasinghe Arachchilage Piyadasa Karunatilleke on 17.05.1978, for

a period of 15 years by the execution of an Indenture of Lease No.

20122. The lessee was accordingly permitted to occupy the building

standing on it and to enjoy the fruits of the land. During this period, the

lessee Karunatilleke operated a metal crusher and a sawmill on that land

and had his office located in that building. At the expiration of the lease

period of 15 years, the 1st Plaintiff informed his lessee to handover

vacant possession. Since the lessee did not vacate, the 1st Plaintiff

instituted action in case No. 10741/L before the District Court of

Kuliyapitiya, in seeking declaration of his title to the said land and the

eviction of the said overholding lessee. The trial Court held in favour of

the 1st Plaintiff and a writ of execution was eventually issued. Pending

determination of the appeal preferred by the said lessee challenging his

eviction, the trial Court issued a writ of execution. Neither the present

Defendant nor his grandfather Balin Appuhamy were parties to that

litigation.

The fiscal of the Court, in order to execute the writ issued in

favour of the 1st Plaintiff, visited the land on 18.10.2000. During his visit,

it was noted down by the fiscal that the building standing on it had two

“lv ldur” adjacent to each other and one Balin Appuhamy is in

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

12

possession of one, while the other was possessed by the lessee

Karunatilleke, the defendant in case No. 10741/L. Upon enquiry, the

fiscal was informed by the Defendant that the building was erected by

Balin Appuhamy, who had occupied it since for over “50” years. The

Defendant before the trial Court in the instant action is Balin

Appuhamy’s grandson, who continued to be in possession of that part of

the building after Balin Appuhamy’s demise. The 1st Plaintiff, when

enquired by the fiscal claimed that his father too had shared the

construction cost of that building. The Plaintiff’s claim of sharing the

construction cost of the Kada Kamaraya was not disputed by the

Defendant at any point of time.

The fiscal, in executing the writ of Court, had thereafter placed the

1st Plaintiff in possession of the land on 09.06.2001, and only on the part

of the building occupied by Karunatilleke leaving out the Kada Kamaraya

in the Defendant’s possession, after instructing him to make a claim

before the trial Court within two weeks. The witness who produced the

certified copy of the fiscal report in case No. 10741/L, marked as “X”

before the trial Court, said that the Court record indicate that the

Defendant had tendered an affidavit presenting a claim. But the

Defendant failed to produce a copy of his affidavit tendered to Court on

the direction of the fiscal, nor did he elicited the nature of the claim he

had presented in the said affidavit, in that case or the decision made by

that Court on it, before the trial Court.

There is oral evidence led on behalf of the Defendant through a

retired Grama Niladhari, who had served the area from 1972 to 1978,

and could recall that Balin Appuhamy had ran a grocery in that building

during his tenure of office.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

13

Clearly it is with the above evidence, the Defendant had sought

to counter the paper title of the 1st Plaintiff to the disputed building

under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. The instant action, being

a Rei Vindiactio action, both the trial Court as well as the High Court of

Civil Appeal have accepted that the Plaintiffs have proved their paper

title to the land. Therefore, it is for the Defendant to establish that the

action of the Plaintiffs is prescribed as he had acquired prescriptive title,

a title adverse to and independent of the paper title of the Plaintiffs. In

doing so, not only must he establish that the point of time he had

commenced such possession, but also he must furnish proof of

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of that property for over ten

years. The applicable principle of law had been succinctly stated by

Gratiaen J in the judgment of Chelliah v. Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR

337. His Lordship states (at p, 342), “where a party invokes the provisions of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and

squarely on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights.” G.P.S. de Silva CJ in Sirajudeen v Abbas (1994) 2 Sri

L.R. 365, had re-emphasised that statement of law.

The Defendant, although sought to ‘tack’ the period his

grandfather had possessed the building to the period of his own, and

thereby strived to establish that they have held that property adverse to

or independent to the paper title of the Plaintiff for over the required

ten-year period, but was conspicuously silent in his evidence on exactly

when did Balin Appuhamy commence his adverse possession against the

Plaintiffs.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

14

At the hearing before this Court, learned Counsel for the

Defendant referred to paragraph 20 of the plaint, where it was stated

that the Defendant had entered the premises “illegally” during the

period the Plaintiffs lost possession from 17.05.1978, and sought to pin

the commencement of his claim of prescription to that date. This

contention does not take the Defendant’s claim any further, as it is not

an acceptable substitute for the total absence of any evidence as to the

starting point of his claim of prescription, presented before the trial

Court.

Why the reference in a plaint, in this instance, could not be taken

as the starting point of the prescriptive period, in the absence of any

specific evidence to that effect presented before the trial Court, could be

explained further. This is primarily due to several reasons.

The averment in the plaint, even if it is taken as an item of

‘evidence’ on the point as the learned Counsel submits, is clearly an

obscure statement as to its meaning. It could well be a due to an instance

of poor draftsmanship as the said averment reads “ j¾I 1978’05’17 osk isg

^w& ^wd& Wmf,aLkhkays bvï fldgia j, N=la;sh iy ysñlï wjqreÿ tlla muK fuu

meñks,slreg fkd,eî ;sîu u; fuu kvqfõ js;a;slre nÿ bvfï 1jeks Wmf,aLKfhA

bvfuys msysá f.dvke.s,af,a kS;S úfr`ëj we;=,a ù we;’”. It speaks of the fact that

the 1st Plaintiff had lost the possession of the building for a period of one

year from 17.05.1978. This is the day on which the 1st Plaintiff had

entered into a lease agreement with Karunatilleke for a period of fifteen

years. The lease was in respect of the land in its entirety including the

only building standing on it. It is highly improbable that the said lessee

would have entered into such an agreement with the father of the 1st

Plaintiff, if the Defendant was already in occupation of the building

standing on that land. There is clear evidence that the lessee had his

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

15

office to the sawmill in that building. The statement that the Plaintiff

had lost possession for over one year does not logically fit in anywhere

as the lessee is entitled to possess the land along with the building,

during the lease period. In fact, it is said in evidence that the lessee was

in possession of the leased-out building and the land for over 20 years,

until the fiscal had placed the 1st Plaintiff back in possession, in June

2001. This statement, therefore, does not indicate exactly when Balin

Appuhamy came into possession. It merely states he had come to possess

when the Plaintiffs have lost possession of their land temporarily.

If this is the correct position as asserted by the Defendant, then

the only building standing on the land, must have been the one put up

by Balin Appuhamy who possessed it since that point of time as evident

from the contents of the fiscal report, marked as ‘X’. That proposition

creates another ambiguity as to the building the father of the 1st Plaintiff

had leased out on 17.05.1978 to his lessee. If the only building was

already in possession of Balin Appuhamy, then the lessee would have

been placed in possession of ‘another’ building by the 1st Plaintiff’s

father on his land. But the plan of the land, to which the 1st Plaintiff had

claimed paper title, led in evidence indicates there is only one building

standing on it.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Defendant that

Balin Appuhamy was in possession of the Kada Kamaraya prior to 1978

not as a licensee, who had entered the premises with leave and license

of the Plaintiffs and thereby acknowledging the rights of the Plaintiffs

over that premises, but as a trespasser who did not recognize any

property rights of them over the said premises, does not fit in with the

evidence presented before the trial Court. If Balin Appuhamy was

already in possession of the only building standing on that land as a

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

16

trespasser prior to 1978, then why did he allow the lessee, who

acknowledged the title of Plaintiffs, to have his office in the same

building?

All these factors favour an inference that Balin Appuhamy’s

construction of the Kada Kamaraya, and occupying it since its

construction, is clearly a subsequent event to the leasing out the land

described in schedule A of the plaint on 17.05.1978. However, despite

the fact it was the Defendant’s burden to establish the starting point of

his adverse possession, absolutely no evidence was produced by him as

to when did Balin Appuhamy come to occupy same. It is also relevant to

note that the incoherent statement from the plaint was not put to the 2nd

Plaintiff who gave evidence before the trial Court, by the Defendant,

during her cross examination.

Once the issues are raised and accepted by Court, the parties must

present evidence in relation to such issues, in assisting the trial Court to

reach a determination in respect of each of them. The District Court will

have its jurisdiction circumscribed only to determine the dispute, as

presented before it by the parties through the issues and on the material

presented before it, per Pathmawathie v Jayasekare (1997) 1 Sri L.R.

248. This Court, in Hanaffi v Nallamma (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 73 stated at p.

77, “since the case is not tried on the pleadings, once issues are raised and

accepted by the court the pleadings recede to the background. The Court of

Appeal was in error in harking back to the pleadings …”.

The Plaintiffs too had adopted to a similar strategy before the trial

Court to fill out a significant gap in their case in challenging the claim of

acquisition of prescriptive title, by introducing the position that Balin

Appuhamy came into possess that part of the building due to actions of

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

17

the lessee, who had allowed him to occupy the building during the lease

period, only through their written submissions tendered before that

Court. Even if there was evidence to that effect, it will not fill the gap left

by the Defendant in his failure to establish a starting point as there too

was no mention of a starting point to the adverse possession.

The only evidence presented before the trial Court, touching on

the circumstances under which Balin Appuhamy came to possess the part

of the building, is from the said fiscal’s report, in which the Court officer

had noted down the explanation of the 1st Plaintiff as well as of the

Defendant for not executing the writ on that part of the building. The

Defendant relied on a particular segment of the fiscal report by marking

it as V3a. The contents of this segment will be considered in greater

detail at a later stage of this judgment. For the purpose of consideration

of the area presently under review, it is relevant to note that both Balin

Appuhamy and the 1st Plaintiff’s father were dead when the 1st Plaintiff

instituted the instant action. Owing to that reason there is no direct

evidence presented through the witnesses who had personal knowledge

of the circumstances under which the Defendant came into possess the

Kada Kamaraya standing on the 1st Plaintiff’s land. The contents of the

fiscal report, being a contemporaneous official record as to the

respective positions taken up by the parties, although based on hearsay

material, were admitted as evidence in the trial before the Court and not

disputed by either party as to its contents or to its reliability.

In that segment of the report V3a, it is indicated that the

Defendant had claimed before the fiscal that his grandfather Balin

Appuhamy, having constructed the building, was in its possession for

over “50” years. Once more, the Defendant had not referred to any

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

18

starting point or explained exactly when and how Balin Appuhamy came

into possess that part of the building, in answering the fiscal’s query.

Clearly there are ample evidence before the trial Court, that the

Defendant and his predecessor were in continuous possession of the

part of the building they allegedly occupied since late-seventies. The

Grama Niladhari Somapala, stated to Court that Balin Appuhamy had

operated a grocery store in the disputed premises and have distributed

food provisions under the Government sponsored food stamps scheme.

Having called the said witness, the Defendant did not elicit the time of

commencement of that business, the capacity in which Balin Appuhamy

operated that grocery store or whether there any official records as to its

ownership.

Considering the available evidence, I am of the view that the

Defendant, in his attempt to discharge the evidentiary burden as to the

starting point of his adverse possession, has undoubtedly failed in that

task, and cannot circumvent his failure by placing reliance on an

averment in the plaint as the contents of the pleadings could not be

taken as ‘evidence’ presented before Court. The failure of the Defendant

to present evidence before the trial Court as to the starting point at

which he had commenced his adverse possession is therefore fatal to his

case, leaving his claim restricted to an instance of mere possession of the

Kada Kamaraya for over a period of ten years, with no specific point of

commencement of any adverse possession.

In addition to the proof of the starting point of the period of

prescription, it was also incumbent upon the Defendant to establish that

his possession for over ten years by a title adverse to or independent to

that of the Plaintiff, as the section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

19

imposes such a requirement, in proof of a claim of acquisition of

prescriptive title.

It had been emphasized by the appellate Courts that, in a claim of

acquisition of a prescriptive title under section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, mode of proving such acquisition is by way of presenting

cogent evidence with specific reference as to the nature of possession.

The applicable law had clearly been laid down by this Court in

Sirajudeen v Abbas(supra) where G.P.S. de Silva C.J., citing Walter

Pereira's Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition, page 396, concurred with the

learned author in stating that "as regards the mode of proof of prescriptive

possession, mere general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not

evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a

title by prescription” and, citing the judgment of Peynis v. Pedro 3 SCC

125, added that “it is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific

facts, and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court”.

The only reliable evidence pointing to the nature of the possession

of over that part of the building could be found contained in the said

fiscal report, marked ‘V3a’ by the Defendant himself and his oral

testimony on that incident. It indicates that when the fiscal had enquired

from the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant as to the basis of the latter’s

possession of Kada Kamaraya, they have stated their respective positions

to the Court official. The positions taken up by the two contesting

parties at that point of time are the only available evidence in relation to

the circumstances under which Balin Appuhamy came to possess the

Kada Kamaraya and nature of the relationship he has had with the father

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

20

of the 1st Plaintiff, the original owner of the land, long before the instant

action was instituted.

The issuance of the writ of execution by the Court, was on the

basis that the building standing on the land is in the possession of the

overholding lessee Karunatilleke, in its entirety. The fiscal, during his

first visit to the land had noted that the present Defendant too was in

occupation of the building, but his possession is limited only to a part of

the building. Anticipating a legal issue in execution of the writ in its

existing form, the Court officer had thereafter sought further directions

from trial Court, reporting back his observations, based on what the

parties have claimed before him. It is in this context; that he had

enquired from the Plaintiff and the present Defendant as to the reasons

for the latter’s possession of a part of the building.

The Defendant claimed that his grandfather Balin Appuhamy had

constructed the building and occupied it for over 50 years, while the 1st

Plaintiff asserted that his father too had financially contributed to the

construction cost of the building. The Defendant, in his evidence before

the trial Court referred to the enquiry made by the fiscal in the presence

of Sugathadasa, the 1st Plaintiff. He stated that the 1st Plaintiff came along

with the fiscal in executing the writ. When questioned by the fiscal, the

1st Plaintiff admitted that the building is possessed for over “50” years

by Balin Appuhamy. He also added that his father had shared the

construction cost of the Kada Kamaraya with Balin Appuhamy. The

evidence of the Defendant varied with the contemporaneous record of

the fiscal only as to the number of years of possession. It is undisputed

that the other part of the building was in the possession of the

overholding lessee.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

21

It is important to note from that evidence that there was some

form of agreement or an understanding existed between the Plaintiff’s

father and the Defendant’s grandfather over the cost of construction of

the building. Both parties admittedly have contributed towards the

construction cost of the building that had been put up on the 1st

Plaintiff’s land. Whether the construction was in relation only to an

addition made to an already existing building or to a partition of an

already constructed building is not clarified by the Defendant. But the

fact that the Plaintiff’s father’s contribution towards construction cost of

the Kada Kamaraya is clearly admitted by the Defendant.

This factual position is indicative of the Defendant conceding to

the right of the 1st Plaintiff over his land and to the building constructed

over it. The Defendant never claimed acquisition of prescriptive title

over the land, when the Court official made enquiries in executing the

writ. It is therefore clear that when Balin Appuhamy had accepted an

unspecified part of the construction cost of Kada Kamaraya from the 1st

Plaintiff’s father, the former had conceded to the latter’s rights over the

land and the Kada Kamaraya. The Defendant, however, in his evidence

said that his grandfather constructed the building on his own land, and

thereby contradicted his own statement to the fiscal.

Therefore, it is clear that Balin Appuhamy, when moving into the

building he claims to have constructed over the 1st Plaintiff’s land, had

conceded to the rights of the Plaintiffs and occupied it under the 1st

Plaintiff’s father and thus assumed a subordinate character in

possessing the said Kada Kamaraya. If that in fact the case is then the

Defendant must, in the alternative, establish at which point that he had

emerged from that subordinate character, which could be referable to an

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

22

act of ouster for he must possess the property by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the Plaintiffs.

In Seeman v David (2000) 3 Sri L.R. 23, at p.26, it had been stated

that:

“it is well settled law that a person who entered

property in a subordinate character cannot claim

prescriptive rights till he changes his character by

an overt act. He is not entitled to do so by forming

a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of

ouster. The proof of adverse possession is a

condition precedent to the claim for prescriptive

rights”.

It is the Defendant’s evidence that his grandfather was in

possession of that part of the building since its construction and only in

November 1983, Balin had rented it out to one Lionel Ekanayake for a

period of five years said to be on a notarially executed document, before

the execution of the said deed of gift in his favour in the year 1987.

However, in this instance too the Defendant did not produce any

document in support of that claim, nor this position was ever put to the

2nd Plaintiff who gave evidence before the trial Court. The 2nd Plaintiff,

in her evidence stated that she was unaware of the reason for exclusion

of the Defendant from the execution of the writ. She also learnt that

Balin Appuhamy, who was in possession of the building, had

fraudulently executed a deed at a subsequent stage, a position the

Defendant himself conceded to during his evidence.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

23

It is significant to note that the Defendant never claimed that he

did not pay any rent to the Plaintiffs during his evidence. This is an

important aspect of the Defendant’s case in establishing adverse

possession. It was for him to establish that he never paid any rent from

the day he came into possession, if he was to be considered as a

trespasser as his Counsel contends. Strangely, the Defendant was totally

silent on that important aspect during the trial, having had the

opportunity to say so.

The Defendant also admitted that neither him nor Balin Appuhamy

paid any assessment rates to the local authority in respect of the

building at any point of time. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs had

tendered proof of payment of assessment rates but did not clearly

establish that they were paid in respect of the premises in dispute. The

witness from the local authority however, denied the fact that the

disputed premises was given the assessment number 146 as the

Defendant suggested. Countering the claim of the Defendant, the

Plaintiffs have led evidence in support of a complaint made by them to

the Government Agent in September 1993, regarding illegal felling of

trees by the lessee.

The Defendant, in support of his claim of prescription, relied

heavily on the finding of the trial Court that he was in possession of the

disputed building for a ‘long period’ of time. However, the trial Court,

as pointed out by the learned President’s Counsel, opted to answer the

issue Nos. 12 and 13 raised on the point as “does not arise” since the

matter is Res Judicata among the parties. At most, the findings of the trial

Court only support the Defendant’s case to the extent that he was in

possession of the building for well over the requisite time period of ten

years.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

24

However, the mere fact of long possession does not qualify any

person to claim prescriptive title under section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Having come into possession of an immovable property

under a subordinate capacity, a person could subsequently acquire

prescriptive title to an immovable property by changing the character of

his possession by an overt act of ouster. It had already been laid down

in Sirajudeen v Abbas (supra) that “…what needs to be stressed is that the

fact of occupation alone would not suffice to satisfy the provisions of section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance. One of the essential elements of the plea of

prescriptive title as provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is

proof of possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or

plaintiff”. Sharvananda J, as he was then, stated in de Silva v

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (1973) 80 N.L.R. 292 stated at

p.295 that;

“The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear

and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile

to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to

the property claimed. In order to constitute adverse

possession, the possession must be in denial of the title of

the true owner. The acts of the person in possession

should be irreconcilable with the rights of the true owner;

the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as

against the true owner.”

In Solomon Dias v William Singho & Others (2015) 1 Sri L.R. 277,

Gooneratne J stated at 286 that “… mere possession for a period of time

cannot give rise to a plea of ouster”. The resultant position is there was no

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

25

acceptable evidence presented by the Defendant establishing an overt

act of ouster.

In view of the contention advanced by the learned President’s

Counsel for the Plaintiffs that, if at all what Balin Appuhamy had

conveyed to the Defendant is his ‘right’ over the possession of the

building only and therefore he is not entitled to acquire prescriptive

title to it as his claim in the trial Court was only regard to a room of a

building and not with regard to a land it stood on, it is necessary to

consider the question of law that had been formulated on that premise,

at this stage of the judgment.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant sought to counter that

contention by stating that in terms of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance not only lands but immovable properties are also made

subject to acquisition of rights by prescription.

It could well be that the learned President’s Counsel relied on the

dicta of Drieberg J in Samaranayake v. Mendoris (1928) 30 N L R 203, in

presenting his contention on this point. In that judgment, Drieberg J,

quoted the following passage from The Digest, XLVI., 1, 12 (Monroe's

Translation) where the underlying law had been stated clearly. It stated

“where a man builds on another man's ground with his own materials, the

building becomes the property of the person who owns the soil itself, and, if the'

former knew that the ground was another's, he is regarded as having lost the

ownership of the materials of his own free will; consequently, even if the

building should be demolished, he has no good right of action to recover the

materials”.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

26

Sansoni J, as he was then, in Kangaratnam v Suppiah (1957) 61

NLR 282, following the dicta of Drieberg J in Samaranayake v.

Mendoris (ibid), stated that “it is clear beyond doubt that our law does not

recognize the ownership of a building apart from the land on which it stands”.

In this context, it is relevant to mention here that the changes in the

contemporary socio-economic considerations have made inroads to the

said common law principle, referred to in Samaranayake v. Mendoris,

with the subsequent enactment of Condominium Property Act No. 12 of

1970, which was subsequently replaced by Apartment Ownership Law

No. 22 of 1973 as amended.

It is correctly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the

Defendant that section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance refers to “lands or

immovable property” and the Kada Kamaraya containing of 747 square

feet is clearly be taken as an item of immovable property. In his answer

the Defendant had taken up the position in paragraph 3 that on the

deed No. 12182 he has become the ‘owner’ of both the building as well

as the land on which it stood. In paragraph 4, he states that he and his

predecessor Balin Appuhamy had possessed the Kada Kamaraya for over

10 years prior to the institution of action, a position he maintained

before the trial Court as well.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant, having referred to the

inclusion of “immovable property” in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, did not elaborate any further in his submissions as to the

failure to produce the said deed of gift before the trial Court, in support

of his claim of acquisition of prescriptive title to the land.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

27

Both parties have contributed towards the cost of the building,

although the individual share of each party is not known. Balin

Appuhamy had accepted the 1st Plaintiff’s father’s contribution both in

monetary terms as well as by providing a plot of land to build on. The

Defendant did not make a claim to the land in the presence of the fiscal.

The evidence available before the trial Court clearly points to the

reasonable inference that the Plaintiff’s father, having allowed Balin

Appuhamy to build over his land and by sharing the cost of construction,

had thereby become a co-owner of the building.

The above factual position was revisited once more, in order to

consider them in the light of another important principle of law. The

factual position referred to above, seemed of an instance where the

principle of jus superficiarium applies. In Ahamadu Natchia v

Muhamadu Natchia (1905) 8 NLR 330, Layards CJ stated the applicable

principle in jus superficiarium as follows:

“The ownership of a house apart from the site on which it

stands is well known to our law. It is called the right of

superficies. The jus superficiarium is the right which a

person has to a building standing on another's ground. It

cannot be termed full ownership, for no one can be legally

full owner of a building who has not the ownership of the

soil. It is the right to build on the soil and to hold and use

the building so erected, until such time as the owner of

the soil tenders the value of the building, if the amount to

be paid has not been previously agreed upon. The right is

acquired and lost like immovable property and is even

presumed to be granted when the owner of the ground

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

28

permits another to build thereupon. The right can be

alienated, and consequently there can be no doubt of its

passing to the heirs of the original owner of the right

(Grot. 2, 46, 9, 10, and 11).

In determining the appeal upon a retiral, Muhamadu Natchia v

Ahamadu Natchia (1906) 9 NLR 331, Lascelles ACJ thought it fit to

emphasise that an agreement between the landowner and the person

who acquires the right is the foundation of the right under jus

superficiarium. His Lordship strongly recommended adopting a cautious

approach in situations where this principle of law applies since “…

claims to a right of ‘superficies’ should not be allowed unless the agreement

between the parties is clearly demonstrated. To sanction laxity of proof in this

respect would be to expose proprietors of house property to serious danger from

claimants alleging that some former owner has permitted them or their

ancestors to build on his land.” It has been held by Gratian J in

Samarasekera v Munasinghe (1954) 55 NLR 558, that the servitude of

jus superficiarum could “… also be acquired by prescription where a person

who, in appropriate circumstances, has erected a building on another's land

and has without interference by the soil-owner exclusively enjoyed the use and

enjoyment of it as a superficiary for the requisite period of ten years”. His

Lordship had further clarified such acquisitions on prescription are

confined to the servitude, and not to soil-rights.

Their Lordships of the Privy Council, in the judgment of Suppiah

v Kanagaratnam (1960) 61 NLR 553, were in “complete agreement” with

the principles of law that had been enunciated in the judgments of

Samaranayaka v Mendoris (supra) and Kangaratnam v Suppiah

(supra), and quoted the section reproduced below from Grotius,

contained in Book II of his Jurisprudence of Holland at Ch. 46, sections

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

29

8-10 (as translated by Professor Lee at page 279 of Volume 1 of his

translation of Grotius).

“8. The right of superficies is the right which a man has to a building

standing upon another man's ground.

9. This right is not full ownership, because in law no one can be full

owner of the building if he is not at the same time owner of the

ground: but it is the right of building upon the site, and of

retaining and using the building until the ground-owner pays

the value of the building or an agreed sum.

10. This right is acquired and lost like immovable property: and is

understood to be effectively granted when the owner of the soil

allows anyone to build upon it.”

Their Lordships, in referring to the pleadings before them,

observed that “It is difficult to suppose that anyone reading these pleadings

and the issues framed thereon would infer that the plaintiff at the trial was

going to endeavour to establish a right to a jus superficiarium as against the

defendant in his capacity as lessee under a lease for 20 years. This right in

Roman Dutch law, which seems but rarely to have arisen for consideration in

the Courts of Ceylon and as to the nature of which it is necessary to refer to the

ancient jurists, is nowhere mentioned in the pleadings or issues.”

In the instant appeal too, the Defendant did not present a claim of

prescriptive title to the disputed building by placing reliance on the

principle of jus superficiarium before the trial Court but was content with

presenting purely a claim of acquisition of prescriptive title upon

possession of the building and the land under it

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

30

These principles of law, although relevant to the consideration of

the consequential question of law formulated by the 1st and 2nd

Plaintiffs, have no application to the question of law formulated by the

Defendant. The High Court of Civil Appeal had considered the

challenges mounted by the Defendant to the paper title of the Plaintiffs

by claiming acquisition of prescriptive title by suggesting issue Nos. 12

and 13 and decided that the Defendant had failed to establish either of

these two issues by presenting evidence. In answering the issue No. 12

against the Defendant, the High Court stated that he had failed to prove

the very deed on which he claimed title to the land where the disputed

building stands. Issue No. 13 too had been answered by the High Court

of Civil Appeal on the basis that the Defendant did not prove the

alleged acquisition of prescriptive title, either by Balin Appuhamy or by

tacking on to the period of possession under Balin Appuhamy to that of

his own.

The Defendant’s complaint was the High Court of Civil Appeal

had failed to consider his case that had been presented before the trial

Court on the lines that had been argued before this Court by the learned

Counsel. The High Court of Civil Appeal decided issue No. 12 in the

negative primarily due to non-production of the deed of gift No. 12182

before the trial Court. The Defendant had admittedly relied on the said

deed in support of his claim to the land by raising issue No. 12 over it at

the commencement of the trial, and therefore it was incumbent upon

him to establish the very basis on which he claim title to the land

covered under the Kada Kamaraya, by proving due execution of the said

deed, under section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. During the trial

before the District Court, the Defendant was called by the Plaintiff as a

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

31

witness during his case. During his examination in chief, said deed was

marked as P14. The Defendant then conceded to the position put to him

by the Plaintiff that it is a fraudulent deed, an allegation already made

by the 2nd Plaintiff, in her evidence. The appeal brief contained a copy

of the said Deed of Gift (at p. 246). Having placed reliance on it by

making specific reference to it during his evidence by marking it as P14,

the Defendant nonetheless withheld its production to Court and did not

lead evidence of its due execution. The copy of the deed bears marking

given to it ‘P14’, but the absence of the initials of the trial Judge on it

seems to suggest that it had not been produced before Court and

thereby abandoning his claim based on the said deed.

It has already been referred to earlier on in this judgment that the

High Court of Civil Appeal did consider the issue Nos. 12 and 13 of the

Defendant and answered them as “not proved”. I have carefully re-

evaluated the evidence placed before the trial Court in its totality and of

the firm view that the appellate Court had correctly answered the said

two issues. Despite the fact that there was evidence that the Defendant

was in possession of the disputed part of the building since late

seventies until the institution of the instant action in February 2003, he

had starved his case of any evidence, either in relation to the starting

point of adverse possession or in relation to the point at which the

permissive possession was changed to that of an adverse possession, by

proof of an overt act of ouster. Thus, it is amply clear that the High

Court of Civil Appeal had more than one reason to answer the issue

Nos. 12 and 13 in the negative as they remain unproved.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

32

It is appropriate to consider the remaining two questions of law,

as formulated by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs as consequential issues of law,

I part with this judgment.

With the dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ action on the basis of Res

Judicata by the trial Court, he had preferred an appeal to the High Court

of Civil Appeal challenging the said dismissal. One of the grounds on

which the Plaintiffs relied on in support of their appeal was that the

trial Court had erroneously determined that the Defendant was in

possession of the building for a long time either legally or illegally. The

Plaintiffs have mounted a challenge on that conclusion reached by the

trial Court on the footing that the trial Court had failed to consider the

basis on which the Defendant was in possession. The Defendant’s

position is that he was in long possession of the building and therefore

had prescribed to its ownership. Clearly, in view of these

considerations, the acquisition of prescriptive title had been very much

an issue before the High Court of Civil Appeal. The appellate Court had

accordingly pronounced its determination on those issues concerning

prescription after due consideration.

The Defendant sought leave to appeal against the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal and after hearing Counsel, this Court

granted leave to consider the question whether the Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeal err in failing to consider the prescriptive title of

the Defendant and his grandfather Balin Appuhamy?

Thus, the claim of acquisition of prescriptive title by the

Defendant through his grandfather Balin Appuhamy had become the

core issue of this appeal. Its consideration is necessitated by the

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

33

question of law that had been formulated on the issue of prescription to

which this Court had granted leave. In granting leave, this Court acted

under section 5C (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Amendment)

Act No. 54 of 2006, since it was of the “opinion the matter involves a

substantial question of law or is a matter fit for review by such Court”. Article

127(1) of the Constitution conferred this Court with jurisdiction “for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by”, Court of

Appeal and any Court of First Instance, and in this particular instance,

by the High Court of Civil Appeal holden in North Western Province at

Kurunegala and the District Court of Kuliyapitiya.

In the circumstances, the question whether the Defendant is

entitled to challenge the issue of prescription since he has failed to

appeal against the Judgment of the trial Court with regard to the issues

raised by him in respect of prescription has already been decided by

this Court when it granted leave having considered same as a

“substantial question of law”.

The mere failure to prefer an appeal by the Defendant, against the

determination of the trial Court on the issues that had been raised on

his plea of prescription, where the Court had not answered in either

way due to the reason that they did not arise for consideration, does not

therefore preclude the Defendant from reagitating them before this

Court, in view of the fact that this Court had already granted leave on

the issue of law dealing with the question of prescription. But the

Defendant could only agitate the issue only to the extent to which leave

was granted by this Court.

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

34

It was contended on behalf of the Plaintiffs that the failure of the

Defendant to challenge the issue pertaining to prescription in terms of

section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code disentitles him from raising the

same before this Court. The section 772 allows a respondent, not only to

support a decree but also to take any objection to such decree, which he

could have taken by way of appeal, although he had not appealed

against any part of it. To avail this opportunity, such a respondent was

obligated by the provisions of that section to give seven days’ notice in

writing of such objection.

This contention need not be considered in detail, in view of the

finding contained in the two immediately preceding paragraphs. Suffice

it to state that mere failure to act under section 772 of the Civil

Procedure Code, does not operate as an absolute bar or an automatic

disqualification against such a respondent, as the appellate Courts have

consciously retained a wide discretion to hear such a respondent, in

fulfilling its responsibility “to do complete justice between the parties”,

despite him not seeking relief under the said section. This point had

already been clarified by this Court in Ratwatte v Gunasekera (1987) 2

Sri L.R. 260, where Sharvananda CJ, in view of the contention that the

plaintiffs in that particular instance had failed to comply with the

provisions of section 772(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, said “… the

provision does not bar the Court, in the exercise of its powers to do complete

justice between the parties, permitting him to object to the decree, even though

he had, failed to give such notice. The Court of Appeal has inherent jurisdiction

to grant or refuse such permission in the interest of justice.”

S.C. Appeal No. 144/2016

35

Thus, the answers to the question of law raised by the Defendant

and the consequential questions of law raised by the Plaintiffs are as

follows :-

Question of law of the Defendant - No

Question of Law No. 1 of the Plaintiffs - Yes, only to the extent to

which leave was granted,

Question of Law No. 2 of the Plaintiffs – Yes, only to the extent to

which leave was granted,

Question of Law No 3 of the Plaintiffs – No.

The appeal is dismissed with costs as the only question of law

raised by the Defendant is answered in the negative.
