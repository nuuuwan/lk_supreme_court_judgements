The Plaintiff filed this action against the Defendant in the

District Court of Badulla seeking to recover a sum of Rs.

872,000 with legal interest, on the basis that he sold 26,446.5

kg of paddy at a rate of Rs. 33 per kg to the Defendant in

September 2009. According to the Plaintiff, at the time of the

sale, the Defendant did not pay a single cent in cash but

provided the Plaintiff with two post-dated cheques marked P1

and P2 P1 for Rs. 20,000 and P2 for Rs. 850,000 both of

which were subsequently dishonoured. Although the action was

not filed under the Bills of Exchange Ordinance or Chapter 53 of

the Civil Procedure Code, the Plaintiff based his case on the

aforesaid two cheques. The Defendant totally denies that he

engaged in any paddy transaction with the Plaintiff and states

that the Plaintiff was a money lender and that the Defendant

borrowed Rs. 20,000 on P1, and P2 was additional security

provided for the same. The Defendant sought dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action. The District Court entered Judgment for the

Plaintiff but, on appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set it

aside and the appeal of the Defendant was allowed. Hence the

Plaintiff before this Court. This Court granted leave to appeal to

the Plaintiff on the following questions of law formulated by the

Plaintiff:

4

(a) Is the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal wrong

in law?

(b) Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider the

fact that the District Court has considered all the

ingredients which should be contained in a judgment as

per section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code?

(c) Can the High Court of Civil Appeal dismiss the Plaintiffs

action without setting aside the judgment of the District

Court?

Let me consider these three questions one by one.

The first question of law formulated by the Plaintiff is broad and

unspecific. It is not clear on what basis the Plaintiff says that

the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is wrong in law.

At the argument before this Court, learned counsel for the

Plaintiff stated that the analysis of evidence by the District Court

was correct whereas the analysis of evidence by the High Court

was incorrect. In the facts and circumstances of this case, I do

not think so. When the High Court stated the Plaintiff had not

proved his case on a balance of probability and then opined that

the Defendants version was more probable than that of the

Plaintiff, the High Court took inter alia the following matters into

consideration:

(a) Admittedly, the Plaintiff is a money lender and the

paddy transaction the Plaintiff speaks of is not

believable.

(b) It is unlikely that a person seeking to buy a large stock

of paddy would come without a rupee in cash but with

two post-dated cheques.

5

(c) If the alleged paddy transaction is a single transaction

which took place on one particular occasion, it was

unnecessary for the Defendant to have provided two

post-dated cheques one for Rs. 20,000 and the other

for Rs. 850,000 instead of offering one post-dated

cheque.

(d) The alleged paddy transaction took place in September

2009, but according to the document V6 dated

06.10.2010, the Defendant had not yet paid back a

sum of Rs. 42,000 previously borrowed from the

Plaintiff in 2006. Therefore, it is unlikely the Plaintiff

would have sold the Defendant a large stock of paddy

worth a sum of Rs. 872,734.50 on credit.

(e) Admittedly, the Defendant is illiterate. He can sign his

name but cannot read or write. The Defendant admits

his signature on the two cheques. The Plaintiffs own

witness Susantha admitted in his evidence that he

(Susantha) filled the cheques at the request of the

Plaintiff and in the absence of the Defendant.

I cannot find fault with the analysis of the learned High Court

Judge in deciding that the Plaintiff failed to prove his case.

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff accepts that if the Plaintiff fails

to prove the paddy transaction, the Plaintiffs action shall fail.

The finding of the High Court that on a preponderance of

probability the paddy transaction was not proved is acceptable.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, the Defendants

version is more probable than that of the Plaintiff.

6

At the argument, learned counsel for the Plaintiff heavily relied

on the failure of the Defendant to reply to the letter of demand

sent prior to the institution of the action. Counsel vehemently

submits that the Defendant is estopped from denying liability

due to the failure to answer the letter of demand.

In business matters, if the party receiving a letter, email or the

like, disputes the assertions contained in it, he must reply, for

failure to do so can be regarded as an admission of the claim

made therein.

In the oft quoted decision of Saravanamuttu v. de Mel (1948) 49

NLR 529, it was held:

In business matters, if a person states in a letter to another

that a certain state of facts exists, the person to whom the

letter is written must reply if he does not agree with or

means to dispute the assertions. Otherwise, the silence of

the latter amounts to an admission of the truth of the

allegations contained in that letter.

The following dicta of Lord Esher M.R. in Wiedeman v. Walpole

(1891) 2 Q.B. 534 was quoted with approval in Colombo Electric

Tramways and Lighting Co. Ltd v. Pereira (1923) 25 NLR 193 at

195:

Now there are casesbusiness and mercantile casesin

which the Courts have taken notice that, in the ordinary

course of business, if one man of business states in a letter

to another that he has agreed to do certain things, the

person who receives that letter must answer it, if he means

to dispute the fact that he did so agree. So, where

merchants are in dispute one with the other in the course of

7

carrying on some business negotiations, and one writes to

the other, but you promised me that you would do this or

that, if the other does not answer that letter, but proceeds

with the negotiations, he must be taken to admit the truth of

the statement.

The above has been quoted with approval in several cases,

including Seneviratne v. LOLC [2006] 1 Sri LR 230.

However, I must add that although it is a general principle that

failure to answer a business letter amounts to an admission of

the contents therein, this is not an absolute principle of law. In

other words, failure to reply to a business letter alone cannot

decide the whole case. It is one factor which can be taken into

account along with other factors in determining whether the

Plaintiff has proved his case. Otherwise, when it is established

that the formal demand, which is a sine qua non for the

institution of an action, was not replied, Judgment can ipso

facto be entered for the Plaintiff. That cannot be done.

Therefore, although failure to reply to a business letter or a

letter of demand is a circumstance which can be held against

the Defendant, it cannot by and of itself prove the Plaintiff's

case. The impact of such failure to reply will depend on the facts

and circumstances of each case. Vide the Judgment of

Weeramantry J. in Wickremasinghe v. Devasagayam (1970) 74

NLR 80.

In the instant case, there is no strong evidence in favour of the

Plaintiff to support the alleged paddy transaction. It is admitted

that the Defendant is illiterate and the Plaintiff is a money

lender. Document V1 goes to prove that the Plaintiff had lent

money to the Defendant prior to the alleged paddy transaction

8

and that loan remained unsettled. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, the failure to answer the letter of

demand P3 is not decisive.

The first question of law shall be answered in the negative.

The second question of law for me is meaningless. It is: the

High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider the fact that the

District Court has considered all the ingredients which should be

contained in a judgment as per section 187 of the Civil Procedure

Code. No argument in relation to the ingredients of a Judgment

was advanced before the High Court by either party. The High

Court did not consider such a matter in its Judgment; nor did

the High Court set aside the Judgment of the District Court on

the basis that the same did not contain all the requirements of a

Judgment as per section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code.

This question shall be answered against the Plaintiff.

The third question of law is of a technical nature. The last

paragraph of the High Court Judgment when translated into

English reads: For the above-mentioned reasons, the Court

decides to allow the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the Plaintiff-Respondents

action is dismissed. No costs.

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff argues it is wrong to have

dismissed the Plaintiffs action without setting aside the

Judgment of the District Court. Although the High Court does

not expressly state that it sets aside the Judgment of the District

Court, the same is implicit in allowing the appeal of the

Defendant-Appellant. After allowing the appeal, the High Court

was correct, for the reasons set out in the Judgment, to have

9

stated that the Plaintiffs action in the District Court shall stand

dismissed. Judgments need not be set aside on such flimsy

technical grounds which have not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
