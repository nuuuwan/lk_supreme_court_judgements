This being a matter that had to be decided on facts, this court has to be careful before taking any decision to interfere with the decision of the learned judge who heard the evidence of the witnesses since it was held in Alwis Vs Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 S L R 119 that it was a well-established principal that finding of primary facts by a trial judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal. It was also held in Fradd Vs Brown& Company Ltd. 20 N L R 282 that it is rare that a decision of a judge of a first instance upon a point of fact purely is overruled by the Court of Appeal.

What section 141(1) of the Companies Act No.17 of 1982 required was to keep the minutes of the directors\u2019 meetings to be entered in a book kept for that purpose. As per sub sections 141 (2) & (3) such minutes purported to be signed by the chairman of the meeting or the next succeeding meeting became evidence of such proceedings until the contrary is proved. It appears if the chairman\u2019s signature was placed it became prima facie evidence. Similar Provision is found in section 147 of the present Act No.7 of 2007. Thus, it does not seem that the placing of the signature of the Chairman was a must but it gave better evidential value making the minute prima facie evidence until the contrary was proved. Thus, in my view, mere fact that it does not contain the signature of the Chairman does not make it a fraudulent document. There was no evidence to show that this minute was not entered in the books kept for that purpose. In fact, other evidence led at the trial indicate that the decisions of this meeting were carried out by the 1st Respondent Company since the 2nd Respondent seems to have become a Director from that time onwards and the registers with the Company Registrar was accordingly changed \u2013 vide P13. As per section 75 of the said Act, without a proper instrument of transfer, a company could not register a transfer. As per P18, it is evidenced that Foreign Collaborators were represented in the said purported Board Meeting. From 1988, said Foreign Collaborators or their representatives in the board seems to have considered the 2nd Respondent as a Director and shareholder since his position in the Company has not been challenged by them as per the evidence led. Even though, the Appellants averred in paragraph 43 of the Petition filed in the District Court as well as in the paragraph 23 of the affidavit filed in lieu of evidence in chief, that the Foreign Collaborators informed their son that they do not know how the shares were registered in the name of the 2nd Respondent, no evidence has been led to established that fact. On the other hand, Foreign Collaborators were there from the beginning of the business and, as per the Article of Association marked P1(a), no share transfer is valid or effectual unless the Board of Directors approve or give consent to it- vide article7. As such, this impression given in the petition that even the Foreign Collaborators do not know how the 2nd Respondent became a shareholder cannot be relied upon. P14 and P15 only reveal that the Appellants had inquired from the Company Secretary appointed in 1996 whether relevant",

Even for the sake of argument one assumes that there would have been a fraud with regard to P18, it had to be fraud by the then directors as it appears to be a minute of the board meeting and, as said before, without the sanction of the Board of Directors no share transfer could have been effected. The application of the Appellant was to rectify the register and not to claim consideration for the shares. It appears that all the people who are responsible for the decision were not made parties since, no Foreign Collaborator or their representative Director is made a party to the action. In other words, fraud and change in the entries in relevant books have been alleged without making the other necessary persons, who are responsible for the relevant changes in the entries in the books as well as for the alleged fraud, parties to the action. It must be noted that the 2nd Defendant who was dead and gone by the time the trial was taken became a Director only from the date of P18 and the others who took part in the purported decision in P18 were not made parties to reveal their side of the story or defend their action. Further as per the Appellants\u2019 version settlement after the interim order in the District Court case was with the Foreign Collaborators and not with the 2nd Respondent. If there was any misdeed in the guise of that settlement as alleged, main perpetrators should be the Foreign Collaborators. It is apparent that at a time when the 2nd Respondent and the Foreign Collaborators were involved in litigation, the Appellants have filed this action in the District Court - vide P17.",

Especially, the 1st Appellant once being the Chairman and the Managing Director, should have known that there shall be general meetings annual or otherwise of which shareholders shall be given notices. If he was the majority shareholder, he would have shown some interest with regard to his rights throughout these ten years. He naturally would have taken interest in the change in the managements etc. especially when he takes up the position that the Company was run by directors who were appointed illegally \u2013 vide page 22 of the proceedings dated 22.02.2011. The 1st Appellant\u2019s explanation seems to be that he had no further interest in the Company after his resignation- vide page 35 of the proceedings dated 22.02.2011. The 1st Appellant further has stated, that when he visited the hotel during his holidays, he came to know that the Company was running at a loss \u2013 vide paragraph 17 of his affidavit and page 34 of the proceedings dated 22.02.2011. It is the human nature to take interest when his rights and investment are at risk. Further the evidence indicates that the 1st Appellant successfully involved in a partition case during the time he was employed in Italy. Most probably he would have acted through an agent. If he had shares and was the major shareholder, it is more probable to expect that such a person would take necessary precautions or interest to protect and enjoy his rights as a shareholder but he has not done so. The Counsel for the Appellants in his submissions argues that learned High Court judge failed to take into consideration that the absence from Sri Lanka was a perfect explanation for lack of participation in the Company\u2019s affairs. It is true that the management of a company is basically with the Board of Directors. However, evidence is that the 1st Appellant came to Sri Lanka for 2 months every year and, as mentioned above if they are the major shareholders, they would have taken interest to see how the company was running by purported illegally appointed directors without giving even a notice of general meetings. Thus, this court cannot find fault with the learned High Court judge for disbelieving the 1st Appellant in that aspect.",

In this regard the learned Counsel for the Appellants in his submissions argues that the production of share certificate has no relevancy to the issue whether the Appellants transferred their rights or not. It is true that it is common ground that the Appellants held the impugned shares prior to 05.01.1988 but the issue No. 7 has been raised to query whether the Appellants are entitled to file and maintain an action in terms of the Section 113 of the Companies Act No.17 of 1982.

To show the Appellants have status to file and maintain the action, they must show that either they are members or aggrieved persons as at the date of application. In that regard the share certificates become prima facie evidence to show their status to file the action, namely their entitlement to shares as at the date of filing the action.",
