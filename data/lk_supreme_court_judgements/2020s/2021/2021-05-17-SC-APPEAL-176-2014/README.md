Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiffs filed this action against the Defendant in the

District Court of Homagama seeking a declaration of title to the

land described in the schedule to the plaint, the ejectment of the

Defendant therefrom, and damages. After the death of the

original Defendant, namely Jayasena, his widow and children

were substituted in his place. The Defendants filed answer

claiming prescriptive title to the land. After trial, the District

Court entered Judgment for the Plaintiffs and, on appeal, the

High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed it. The Defendants have now

come before this Court against the Judgment of the High Court

of Civil Appeal.

5

This Court granted leave to appeal on the question whether the

High Court of Civil Appeal erred in law in coming to the

conclusion that the Plaintiffs proved title to the land despite Deed

Nos. 36988 and 38247 as pleaded in the plaint not being

tendered in evidence. The contention of learned counsel for the

Defendants is that the Plaintiffs failed to prove the chain of title.

In paragraph 3 of the amended plaint, the Plaintiffs state that the

original owner, namely William Singho, sold the land in suit,

which is in extent of an acre, to the deceased husband of the

1st Plaintiff who was also the father of the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs,

namely Karunadasa, by Deed No. 7236. This Deed was marked

P1 in evidence without any objection.

In paragraphs 4 and 5, the Plaintiffs further state that by Deed

No. 36988, Karunadasa alienated the land to a person by the

name of Weerasinghe on a conditional transfer, and Weerasinghe

in turn retransferred the land to Karunadasa by Deed No. 38247

in fulfilment of the condition set out in the former Deed.

The Defendants, in paragraph 3 of the amended answer, accept

that Karunadasa purchased the acre mentioned above, but

their position is that it is a portion of a larger land in extent of 4

acres, and the balance 3 acres excluding the said acre had

been gifted to the original Defendant Jayasena by Deed No.1903.

By the same paragraph, the Defendants further take up the

position that they have possessed this acre since 1950 with

the leave and license of Karunadasa, together with the balance

portion of the larger land as one entity, and acquired prescriptive

title to it. Karunadasa and Jayasena are siblings.

6

Although the Defendants admit in their amended answer that

Karunadasa purchased the disputed acre, which is the subject

matter of this action, in the District Court they never took up the

position in their answer or by way of the issues or in evidence or

written submissions that the Plaintiffs do not have paper title to

the said acre or that Karunadasa subsequently lost his paper

title. Instead, the Defendants made a claim in reconvention to

that acre by way of prescriptive title.

It is well settled law that in a rei vindicatio action the burden is

on the Plaintiff to prove title to the land in suit irrespective of

weaknesses in the Defendants case. H.N.G. Fernando J. (later

C.J.) in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 171

required strict proof of the Plaintiffs title. But this shall not be

understood that a Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove

his title beyond reasonable doubt such as in a criminal

prosecution, or on a high degree of proof as in a partition action.

The standard of proof of title is on a balance of probabilities as in

any other civil suit. The stringent proof of chain of title, which is

the norm in a partition action to prove the pedigree, is not

required in a rei vindicatio action.

Professor George Wille, in his monumental work Willes Principles

of South African Law, 9th Edition, states at page 539:

To succeed with the rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on

a balance of probabilities, first, his or her ownership in the

property. If a movable is sought to be recovered, the owner

must rebut the presumption that the possessor of the

movable is the owner thereof. In the case of immovables, it

is sufficient as a rule to show that title in the land is

registered in his or her name.

Dr. H.W. Tambiah opines in Survey of Laws Controlling

Ownership of Lands in Sri Lanka, International Property

Investment Journal, Vol 2, pp. 217-246 at p. 244:

As a practical matter, the burden of proof in a rei vindicatio

action is not burdensome. The Plaintiff must prove only that

he is the probable owner of the property.

Professor G.L. Peiris, in his treatise Law of Property in Sri Lanka,

Vol I, stresses at page 304:

It must be emphasized, however, that the observations in

these cases to the effect that the Plaintiffs title must be

strictly proved in a rei vindicatio, cannot be accepted as

containing the implication that a standard of exceptional

stringency applies in this context. An extremely exacting

standard is insisted upon in certain categories of action

such as partition actions.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Jinawathie v. Emalin

Perera [1986] 2 Sri LR 121 held that the Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio

action shall prove that he has title to the disputed property and

that such title is superior to the title, if any, put forward by the

Defendant, or that he has sufficient title which he can vindicate

against the Defendant.

The Plaintiff in Jinawathies case filed a rei vindicatio action

against the Defendants relying upon a Statutory Determination

made under section 19 of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972.

The Defendants sought the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action on

the basis that the alleged Statutory Determination did not convey

any title on the Plaintiff and that in the absence of the Plaintiff

8

demonstrating dominium over the land, the Plaintiffs action

shall fail. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeal held

with the Plaintiff and the Supreme Court affirmed it. Ranasinghe

J. (later C.J.) with the agreement of Sharvananda C.J.,

Wanasundera J., Atukorale J., and Tambiah J., whilst

emphasising that in a rei vindicatio action proper, the Plaintiffs

ownership of the land is of the very essence of the action,

expressed the view of the Supreme Court in the following terms

at page 142:

This principle was re-affirmed once again by Gratiaen J. in

the case of Palisena v. Perera (1954) 56 NLR 407 where the

Plaintiff came into court to vindicate his title based upon a

permit issued under the provisions of the land Development

Ordinance (Chap. 320). In giving judgment for the Plaintiff,

Gratiaen, J. said: a permit-holder who has complied with

the conditions of his permit enjoys, during the period for

which the permit is valid, a sufficient title which he can

vindicate against a trespasser in civil proceedings. The fact

that the alleged trespasser had prevented him from entering

upon the land does not afford a defence to the action.

In a vindicatory action the Plaintiff must himself have title to

the property in dispute: the burden is on the Plaintiff to

prove that he has title to the disputed property, and that

such title is superior to the title, if any, put forward by the

Defendant in occupation. The Plaintiff can and must succeed

only on the strength of his own title, and not upon the

weakness of the defence.

On a consideration of the foregoing principles relating to

the legal concept of ownership, and to an action rei

9

vindicatio it seems to me that the Plaintiff-respondent did,

at the time of the institution of these proceedings, have, by

virtue of P6 [Statutory Determination], sufficient title which

she could have vindicated against the Defendants-

appellants in proceedings such as these.

In Banda v. Soyza [1998] 1 Sri LR 255 a rei vindicatio action

proper the Supreme Court took the view that in order for the

Plaintiff to succeed in a rei vindicatio action he shall prove

superior title to that of the Defendant.

In Bandas case the Plaintiff sought a declaration of title to the

land in suit, the ejectment of the Defendants and damages. After

trial, Judgment was entered in favour of the Plaintiff. The Court

of Appeal set aside the Judgment of the District Court and the

Plaintiffs action was dismissed on the ground that the Plaintiff

failed to establish title to the subject matter of the action or even

to identify the land in suit. But the Supreme Court set aside the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal and restored the Judgment of

the District Court on the basis that there was sufficient evidence

led on behalf of the Plaintiff to prove the title and the identity of

the lots in dispute. The Supreme Court particularly relied upon

a Lease Bond executed in 1906, which was not considered by the

Court of Appeal, to decide that the Plaintiff was the owner of the

land. G.P.S. de Silva C.J., at page 259, laid down the criterion in

the following manner:

In a case such as this, the true question that a court has to

consider on the question of title is, who has the superior

title? The answer has to be reached upon a consideration of

the totality of the evidence led in the case.

10

In Preethi Anura v. William Silva (SC Appeal No.

SC/LA/116/2014, Minutes of the Supreme Court on 05.06.2017),

the Plaintiff filed a rei vindicatio action against the Defendant

seeking a declaration of title to the land in suit and the ejectment

of the Defendant therefrom. The District Court held with the

Plaintiff but the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the

Judgment of the District Court on the basis that the Plaintiff

failed to prove title to the land. The Plaintiffs title commenced

with a Statutory Determination made under section 19 of the

Land Reform Law in favour of his grandmother, who had

bequeathed the land by way of a last will to the Plaintiff, with the

land being later conveyed to the Plaintiff by way of an executor

conveyance. No documentary evidence was tendered to establish

that the last will was proved in Court and admitted to probate in

order to validate the executor conveyance by which the Plaintiff

claimed title to the land. The District Court was satisfied that

the said factors were proved by oral evidence but the High Court

found the same insufficient to discharge the burden that rests

upon a Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action, which the High Court

considered to be very heavy. The Supreme Court reversed the

Judgment of the High Court and restored the Judgment of the

District Court, taking the view that the Plaintiff had proved title

to the land despite the purported shortcomings. In the course of

the Judgment, Dep C.J. remarked:

In a rei vindicatio action, the Plaintiff has to establish the

title to the land. Plaintiff need not establish the title with

mathematical precision nor to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt as in a criminal case. The Plaintiff's task

is to establish the case on a balance of probability. In a

partition case the situation is different as it is an action in

11

rem and the trial judge is required to carefully examine the

title and the devolution of title. This case being a rei

vindicatio action this court has to consider whether the

Plaintiff discharged the burden on balance of probability.

What is the degree of proof expected when the standard of proof

is on a balance of probabilities? In Miller v. Minister of Pensions

[1947] 2 All ER 372, Lord Denning declared:

That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable

degree of probability, but not so high as is required in a

criminal case. If the evidence is such that the tribunal can

say, We think it more probable than not, the burden is

discharged, but if the probabilities are equal, it is not.

Notwithstanding that in a rei vindicatio action the burden is on

the Plaintiff to prove title to the land no matter how fragile the

case of the Defendant is, the Court is not debarred from taking

into consideration the evidence of the Defendant in deciding

whether or not the Plaintiff has proved his title. Not only is the

Court not debarred from doing so, it is in fact the duty of the

Court to give due regard to the Defendants case, for otherwise

there is no purpose in a rei vindicatio action in allowing the

Defendant to lead evidence when all he seeks is for the dismissal

of the Plaintiffs action.

The Court shall not protect rank trespassers and promote

unlawful occupation to the detriment of the legitimate rights of

lawful landowners by setting an excessively higher standard of

proof in a rei vindicatio action than what is expected in an

ordinary civil suit.

12

Bearing in mind the burden of proof cast upon the Plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action, if the Plaintiff in such a case has sufficient

title or superior title than that of the Defendant, the Plaintiff

shall succeed. No rule of thumb can be laid down on what

circumstances the Court shall hold that the Plaintiff has

discharged his burden. Whether or not the Plaintiff proved his

title shall be decided upon a consideration of the totality of the

evidence led in the case.

For completeness, let me add the following.

There is a difference between a rei vindicatio action proper and a

declaration of title action in terms of the burden of proof of title,

notwithstanding that a declaration of title and ejectment of the

Defendant is the common relief sought in both actions.

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (supra) at page 173 Gratiaen J.

explained this in the following manner:

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained

by way of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action

proper (which is in truth an action in rem) or in a lessors

action against his overholding tenant (which is an action in

personam). But in the former case, the declaration is based

on proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of the

contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the

lessor is the true owner.

In simple terms, in an action filed by the Plaintiff seeking a

declaration of title to and the ejectment of the Defendant from

the land in suit, if the Plaintiff can prove that the Defendant

came into possession as a licensee or lessee under him which

13

was later terminated, the Defendant cannot defeat the action of

the Plaintiff on the ground that the Plaintiff is not the owner of

the land. In such a situation, the Plaintiff can automatically

obtain a declaration of title through the operation of the rule of

estoppel contained in section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance:

No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through

such tenant, shall during the continuance of the tenancy, be

permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at

the beginning of the tenancy, a title to such immovable

property; and of licensee of no person who came upon any

immovable property by the licence of the person in

possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such

person had a title to such possession at the time when such

licence was given.

In fact, a licensor, lessor or landlord need not necessarily be the

owner of the property to grant leave and licence, lease or rent out

the property. A person may let immovable property to another

without having any right or title to it or without any authority

from the true owner. Such a lease is valid between the landlord

and the tenant, but the true owner is not bound by it. (Professor

George Wille, Landlord and Tenant in South Africa, 4th Edition,

page 20; Dr. H.W. Tambiah, Landlord and Tenant in Ceylon, page

48; Imbuldeniya v. De Silva [1987] 1 Sri LR 367 at 372, 380)

In the unique facts and circumstances of the instant case, failure

to tender Deed Nos. 36988 and 38247 is not fatal and the

Plaintiffs action need not be dismissed on this ground. When the

totality of the evidence led in this case is considered, I am

satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved title to the property on

14

the balance of probabilities and the Defendants counter claim to

the same on prescriptive title is bound to fail.

I answer the issue on which leave was granted in the negative.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.
