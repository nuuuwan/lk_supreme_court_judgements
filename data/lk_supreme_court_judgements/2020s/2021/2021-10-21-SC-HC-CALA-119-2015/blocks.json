Thus, the parties were directed to file written submissions in this regard within two months from that date. However, it can be seen that the Plaintiff who took up the preliminary objection did not file written submissions within the given time even though the Defendant Petitioners filed their written submissions as per the said direction. Inquiry on the preliminary objection was rescheduled on many occasions due to various reasons and on behalf of the Plaintiff, written submissions have been tendered later on 07.11.2018. It should be noted that in these written submissions filed on behalf of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff has later taken up the position that the Defendant Petitioners have violated the provisions in Rule 28(2) and 28(5) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990. Thus, it appears that the Plaintiff has taken up the position that the present application is violative of Rule 28(2) for the first time through these written submissions filed after the Defendant Petitioners\u2019 written submissions, for which the Defendant Petitioners did not have any opportunity to address the court through their written submissions. This court originally directed to file written submissions and fixed the matter for inquiry on the preliminary objection raised on 12.02.2016 which objections did not contain any objection under Rule 28(2). Nevertheless, parties had the opportunity to make their oral submissions during the inquiry held on 13.11.2019. As the preliminary objections are based on three different supreme court rules, namely Rule 4, 28(2) and 28(5) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, this court has to consider those Rules and see whether this application is violative of the stipulations made therein by those Rules.",

As per the endorsement made by the Registrar at the end of \u2018A\u2019 it is certified that it is a true copy of the case record of Kalutara District Court Case No. P/6377 and Kalutara Civil Appeal High Court Case No.4/5. However, this certified case record marked \u201cA\u201d does not contain the written submissions and proxies filed by the parties, minutes made by the judges in the Civil Appellate High Court or the judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judges. The brief contains three more sets of documents marked \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, and \u2018D\u2019. D is the certified copy of the judgment delivered by the learned High Court Judges. At the end of the document marked as \u2018C\u2019, it is certified that it is a true copy of the written submission filed by the Defendant before the Civil Appellate High Court- (In fact the title to the said written submissions states that it is the submissions for 2nd to 5th and 8th to 20th Defendants. However, the notice of appeal filed for that appeal found at page 1 of \u201cA\u201d indicates that 4th, 5th 13th, 16th and 17th defendants were dead). At the end of document marked \u2018B\u2019, the registrar has endorsed that it is a true copy of the journal entries annexed to, and the written submissions tendered by the Defendants in the appeal brief no. 4/5(F) when in fact it is the written submissions tendered by the Plaintiff to the Civil Appellate High Court case record. Hence, it appears that the said certifications are inaccurate and there is no certification by a registrar of the Civil Appellate High Court to indicate that the documents found in this brief contains the complete case record of the Civil Appellate High Court. What is available in the brief is some piecemeal certification of different parts of the lower court case records with some inaccuracies as indicated above. In this backdrop, it should be also noted that even though the journal entry dated 2014.04.24 in the set of documents marked \u2018B\u2019 states that an amended caption was tendered by the Plaintiff\u2019s attorney-at-law after the substitution for 4A and 5th defendants were done on 24.03.2014, the said amended caption cannot be found among the documents tendered to this court. Thus, whether any deficiency found in the aforesaid second part of the caption to this court is a reflection of the errors in the said amended caption tendered by the Plaintiff himself, who raises this objection, or not, cannot be decided at this moment. If it is an error caused due to an error made by the plaintiff in the lower court, he should not be allowed to capitalize on it by raising preliminary objections with regard to the second part of the caption in this court which reflects the caption of the Civil Appellate High Court. There is nothing to show",

    "text": "On the other hand, action filed in the original court was a partition action and the Partition Act was amended by the Act No. 17 of 1997. Section 27 of the said Act replaced the Section 81 of the principal enactment with a new Section 81 which required every party to a partition action to file a memorandum nominating legal representatives. Section 29 of the said amending Act states that every pending partition action on the commencement of the said amending Act, shall, so far as the circumstances permit, be continued and proceeded with final judgment and decree under the provisions of the principal enactment as amended by the said Act,(including the provisions requiring the filing of memoranda nominating legal representatives by parties to the action and others) in the same manner and every respect as if the same had been originally instituted after the date of commencement of this Act. Thus, nominating a legal representative has become a responsibility of the relevant party in new cases as well as pending cases after the said amendment. As per subsections 81(9) and (10) of the Partition Act, failure to file a memorandum and not appointing a legal representative cannot make any judgment, decree, order, sale, partition or a thing done in a partition action invalid. Section 81(12) of the Partition Act states that no proceedings under the partition law shall be postponed or adjourned nor any step in the action be postponed by reason of a death of a party required to file a memorandum. Thus, it is clear that after the said amendment brought in 1997 August, it was the duty of the relevant party to nominate his legal representative and death of a party could not make the proceedings postponed or invalid when there is no nomination. Hence, one can say that, now, the Plaintiff or any other party carrying on with the case is not burdened with taking steps to substitute. In this backdrop, now I prefer to look at the aforesaid second part of the caption again. As said before, the Defendant Petitioners have named the Plaintiff Appellant as he was the appellant in the Civil Appellate High Court and also named all the defendants in the original court as the Defendant Respondents in this second part but 1st, 7th ,16th and 17th has been named as deceased parties without substitution. It must be noted that the Plaintiff who raises the preliminary objection had not even mentioned 1st, 7th, 16th and 17th Defendants as Respondents to his petition of appeal to the Court of Appeal for some reason.",

As per section 81(14) of the Partition Act, a legal representative means a person who represents the estate of the deceased person. Generally, in a partition action shares are given or rights are granted to the original party and if the party is dead, the legal representative gets it not for him/her but on behalf of all the heirs of the deceased or for the person/s entitled under the original deceased party. Thus, since the Defendant Petitioners have named the original deceased party in the 2nd part of the caption which is not there for the naming of the Respondents who must be served with notices, one can say that they have sufficiently complied with the rule 28(2) though not perfectly complied with.

As mentioned before, this appeal has been preferred against the Plaintiff, 6th Respondent and 23rd and 24th Respondents but without making the substituted Respondents of the 23rd and 24th Respondents parties. It must be taken into account that, since this is a partition action, unallotted shares can be claimed in the same action by parties, if their claims fit into or not in conflict with the original ownership or the pedigree approved by the judgment which gave rights to the plaintiff and the 6th defendant. In a partition action when a judgment is given allotting shares to some parties it not only decides the rights of those parties to the corpus of the action but also decides the identity of the corpus as well as a pedigree flowing from an original ownership or part of such pedigree as part of a judgment in rem. As such, if there is any party who can tender an application for unallotted shares, his rights also may be affected by the success of this appeal since the prayer in the application is to set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court. Since the original action was filed as a partition action whatever may be the claim in the original court made by any party, once a decision is given to partition the land with unallotted shares it is always better to make all the parties, who claimed shares in the land, respondents in appeal since they may get a chance to claim rights in unallotted shares without filing a fresh action through the practice developed by our courts.",

Even his petition of appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court indicates that they were dead and no substitutions have been done. Documents available in this brief do not indicate that anyone was substituted on behalf of them during the appeal before the Civil Appellate High Court. Thus, the Plaintiff should not be allowed to raise preliminary objections in relation to not making the 1st, 16th, and 17th Defendant Respondents parties to this application when it appears that he himself has not made them parties to his appeal to the court below or when he has not taken steps to substitute for them in the court below. On the other hand, there is no material before this court to show that 1st, 16th and 17th Defendants nominated any legal representatives for them as per the requirements of the Partition Act as amended. As per section 81(9) and (10) of the Partition Act, proceedings cannot be invalidated due to non-appointment of legal representatives when a party failed to file a memorandum of nominees. Even if an application to substitute is made and appointment is made thereon, the legal representative would be bound by the proceedings up to the time of such appointment. Thus, I am not inclined to consider the preliminary objection in relation to not making the 1st ,16th and 17th Defendants party Respondents to this application. \u2022 Substituted 7th Defendant has not been made a party Respondent to this",

He has not appealed against the district court judgment when it dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Proceedings before the District Court does not show that he took part in the trial. Since the Defendant Petitioners pray through this appeal to set aside the judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court, one may argue that the result of this appeal does not affect adversely to this substituted defendant and therefore, it is not necessary to make him a respondent. I am not in total agreement with that argument. It must be observed that the 7th Defendant though filed a contesting statement of claim to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, he did not contest the plaintiff\u2019s case at the trial. In the same manner the substituted 7th defendant did not file an appeal against the High Court Judgment. However, he is a person who by a statement of claim asked for shares in the corpus. Thus, he is a party who may be entitled to claim from the unallotted shares without filing a fresh action. Hence, the substituted 7th defendant is a party who can be considered as a person whose interests may be adversely affected by the success of this appeal. In my view, not making him a party to this appeal as a Respondent affects the full title of this application as well as is not in compliance with the aforesaid Supreme Court Rule 28(5) because it is for the substituted 7th defendant to decide whether he claims from the unallotted shares or ignore his claims. \u2022 13th defendant has not been made a respondent to this appeal by the",
