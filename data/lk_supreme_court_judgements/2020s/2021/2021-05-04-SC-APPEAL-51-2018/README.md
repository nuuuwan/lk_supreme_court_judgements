Background

On 18th July 2008, the Officer-in-Charge of the Special Crimes Investigation

Bureau of the Ratnapura Police Station (Complainant - Respondent -

Respondent) instituted criminal proceedings against the Accused - Appellant

- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) in the Magistrate’s

Court of Ratnapura by filing a Complaint (commonly referred to as a ‘Plaint’)

in terms of section 136(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. (Number

68675 had been assinged to this case.) The charge sheet attached to the

Complaint contained three charges, namely ‘Cheating’, ‘Criminal Breach of

Trust’ and ‘Criminal Misappropriation of Property’. The Appellant pleaded

‘not guilty’ and a trial was held. Following the conclusion of the trial, on 29th

August 2014 the learned Magistrate found the Appellant ‘guilty’ and

accordingly he was convicted of all three charges. On 12th December 2014, the

Appellant was sentenced to a term of 1-year rigorous imprisonment and a fine

of Rs. 1,500/=, per each charge. The Appellant appealed against the said

conviction and sentence to the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province,

holden in Ratnapura. (No. HCR/APL 42/14 had been assigned to that Appeal.)

Following the hearing of the Appeal, the High Court acquitted the Appellant

with regard to the second and third charges, and hence quashed the

corresponding sentences. The conviction and sentence pertaining to the first

charge of ‘cheating’, was affirmed. Subject thereto, the Appeal was dismissed.

This Appeal is against the said judgment of the High Court of the Provinces.

Page 4 of 35

Following a consideration of an Application seeking Leave to Appeal against

the afore-stated judgment of the High Court, this Court on 16th March 2018

granted Leave to Appeal, on the following questions of law:

(i) “Did the Provincial High Court fail to analyze the lack of mens rea on the part of

the Petitioner to constitute an act of cheating?”

(ii) “Did the Provincial High Court fail to analyze that the virtual complainant had

not been deceived by the act of the Petitioner, which is a necessary ingredient to

constitute a charge of cheating?”

[The reference to the ‘Petitioner’ in these questions, is a reference to the present

‘Appellant’.]

Offence

According to the charge sheet, the offence in respect of which the Appellant

stands convicted and sentenced, is as follows:

“That on or about the 25th September 2007, by asserting that money was required for

a business purpose, having obtained Rs. 8,00,000/= from Kalawitigoda Pathirannalage

Chandralatha, residing at No. 74, Polhengoda, Ratnapura, and in respect thereof

having got her to repose confidence by tendering to her a cheque drawn for Rs.

8,00,000/= bearing No. 908494 drawn against Account No. 013001001397

maintained at National Development Bank, Ratnapura, and having told her that she

could on the date contained in the cheque deposit the said cheque and obtain money,

and thereafter by not having either deposited money in the relevant account on the date

stated in the cheque or returned the money to her, dishonestly or fraudulently cheated

her, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 403 of the Penal

Code.”

Evidence

The virtual complainant Kalawitigoda Pathirannalage Chandralatha

Athukorala (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the ‘virtual complainant’) is

a married lady with grown up children. The Appellant had been known to her

for approximately five to six years. He was a friend of one of her sons. He had

been preparing accounts on behalf of her son, for tax purposes. The Appellant

used to frequent her house. She knew that the Appellant was running a shop

at the supermarket in a building of the Ratnapura Municipality. On 12th

September 2007, the Appellant sought a ‘favour’ from the virtual complainant;

he solicited eight hundred thousand rupees on the premise that money was

required for some business activity that he had commenced. She told the

Appellant that she would think about it (the request for a loan) and respond.

She had with her, four hundred thousand rupees. She collected another four

hundred thousand rupees through several ways. Accordingly, on 25th

September 2007, the virtual complainant gave a loan of eight hundred

thousand rupees (in cash) to the Appellant. The Appellant offered to the virtual

complainant a cheque. In response, the virtual complainant told the Appellant

that she knew that there wasn’t money in the Appellant’s bank account and

hence the cheque was not necessary. The Appellant responded and said “its

OK aunty, keep the cheque with you for the purpose of having confidence”.

Consequently, the Appellant had drawn and given the virtual complainant a

cash cheque bearing No. 908494 issued by the NDB Bank drawn against account

No. 013001001397, with a face value of eight hundred thousand rupees. The

date on the cheque was 20th December 2007 (i.e. the cheque was post-dated).

The virtual complainant’s position is that she gave the loan to the Appellant

because she had ‘confidence / trust’ that the Appellant would return the money

to her. According to her, the money was given to the Appellant as a loan and

in a lump sum. The virtual complainant told the Appellant that she required

Page 6 of 35

the money to be returned by December that year, as she would have to spend

money for an eye operation.

In December 2007, she contacted the Appellant and asked him to return the

money. He originally undertook to do so. However, he failed to return the

money. Later, when she called the Appellant, he did not even pick-up the

phone. Thus, the Appellant informed one of her sons, Madhuka Nishantha

Athukorala. On 27th December 2007, they deposited the cheque in the account

of her son, Madhuka. The cheque was dishonoured by the bank. She has

produced to Court the ‘Notice of Dishonour’ issued by the Bank, marked “P1”.

Attached to the notice of dishonour issued by the bank, had been a photo-copy

of the cheque that was dishonoured. After the cheque was dishonoured, the

virtual complainant had informed the Appellant. However, he has not come to

meet the Appellant. Up to the time at which the virtual complainant gave

evidence in Court, the Appellant had not returned the money.

However, the case record reveals that after the case for the prosecution was

closed and the learned Magistrate called upon the Appellant to present defence

evidence, the Appellant had returned a portion of the money to the virtual

complainant and again defaulted.

Under cross-examination, the virtual complainant testified that, she had

‘utmost confidence’ in the Appellant. No document was exchanged between the

parties at the time the loan was given. She has denied a suggestion put to her

that she declined to accept the cheque due to the reason that she knew that

there wasn’t money in the Appellant’s bank account. However, she has

admitted that she told the Appellant that she did not require the cheque, and

that what was required was for him to return the money, as she wanted the

Page 7 of 35

money for her eye operation. She has also admitted the suggestion made by

the learned counsel for the Appellant, that the cheque was accepted by her as

a form of ‘security’. The appellant had told the virtual complainant that he “will

definitely return the money in December”. The witness has responded positively

to the position taken up by the defence counsel that the money was given to

the Appellant as a loan. She has also responded positively to the position put

to her that the Appellant gave a promise to her and he was unable to return

the money to her. Under cross-examination, the witness has also said that the

Appellant requested her to even mortgage her jewelry and give him the money

he solicited. Thus, she had collected the money from multiple sources and

given eight hundred thousand rupees to the Appellant. The virtual

complainant has denied the suggestion put to her under cross-examination,

that she gave the money to the Appellant in three instalments. She has been

emphatic that she gave the eight hundred thousand rupees to the appellant in

a lump sum. She has also denied the suggestion put to her that the loan was

given to the Appellant at an interest rate of eight percent.

The second witness to testify on behalf of the prosecution had been Jinendra

Asanga Dawulgama, an Assistant Manager of the Ratnapura Branch of the

National Development Bank. According to his testimony, Kapila Nishshanka

Kumarage (the Appellant) had an account bearing No. 013001001397,

maintained at the Ratnapura branch of the National Development Bank.

Cheque No. 908494 had been drawn against that account. This account had

been ‘closed’ with effect from 11th January 2007. The account had been closed

by the Bank, following three cheques issued against the account having got

dishonoured. A letter had been sent to the Appellant notifying him that the

bank had closed the account. At the time cheque No. 908494 had been issued,

the account remained closed. The witness has produced to Court a statement

Page 8 of 35

of accounts relating to the relevant bank account, which was marked “P2”.

According to the witness, that statement reflects inter alia to the dishonouring

of the cheque in issue.

The third and the final witness to testify for the prosecution was Police

Sergeant Kulatunga Mudiyanselage Jayanath, of the Special Crimes

Investigations Unit of the Ratnapura Police Station. His evidence was formal

in nature. The virtual complainant had lodged a complaint regarding this

matter on 24th January 2008, and he had conducted the investigation into that

complaint.

Following the closure of the case for the prosecution, the learned Magistrate

had called upon the Appellant to present the defence case. On 15th November

2015, learned defence counsel has informed court that no evidence will be

presented to Court on behalf of the Appellant. Thus, the trial had been

concluded.

Submissions of counsel

Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that, “a charge of cheating requires

the complainant to handover to the offender an article or property as a result of being

deceived”. (emphasis added.) In the instant case, “the complainant should have

been deceived by receiving of the cheque drawn by the Appellant”. He further

submitted that, “it is essential that the lending of money occurred due to the act of

deceit committed by the Accused, which induced the act of lending money to the

Appellant”. “If the lending of money had not been induced by giving the cheque to the

complainant, the charge of cheating framed against the Appellant would not be

proved”. He submitted further, that the gravamen of the charge relates to the

Page 9 of 35

“inducement caused by the deceit of giving a cheque without funds, and not to the

promise to re-pay the sum borrowed by the Appellant”.

Learned counsel cited illustration “(f)” of section 398 of the Penal Code, which

provides as follows:

“A, intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to repay any money that Z may

lend to him, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend him money, A not intending to

repay it. A cheats.”

Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that, the facts of this matter are

distinguishable with the facts of illustration “(f)” of section 398 of the Penal

Code, since the Appellant did not dishonestly induce the virtual complainant

to lend him money, and hence the said illustration is inapplicable to this case.

Learned counsel for the Appellant also drew the attention of the Court to

illustration “(d)” of section 398, which provides as follows:

“A, by tendering in payment for an article, a cheque on a bank with which A keeps no

money, and by which A expects that the cheque will be dishonoured, intentionally

deceives Z, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to deliver the article, intending not to

pay for it. A cheats.”

Learned counsel submitted that though it appears that the facts of the instant

matter come within the scope of illustration “(d)”, it is necessary to examine

whether it was the tendering of the cheque that induced the virtual

complainant to lend money to the Appellant. He submitted that for some

conduct to amount to deception, a false impression must be intentionally given

or a false statement should be made, to induce someone to act upon the said

representation. His position was that, as the evidence suggests, the lending of

the money was not induced by giving the cheque, and was occasioned by the

trust placed on the Appellant by the virtual complainant. He submitted that

Page 10 of 35

the cheque was not even given as a mode of repayment. He further submitted

that, according to the evidence, when the money was due, the virtual

complainant originally tried to contact the Appellant to ask for the money to

be returned, and it was only when her attempts to contact the Appellant failed,

that she gave the cheque to her son to deposit it. Thus, learned counsel

summed up his submission on the footing that “the lending of the money was not

induced by the tendering of the cheque”. Therefore, he submitted that the

prosecution has failed to establish the element of ‘deception by tendering the

cheque’, and hence the Appellant’s conviction for ‘cheating’ was unlawful.

Accordingly, he urged that the Appeal be allowed and the conviction and

sentenced imposed on the Appellant be quashed.

On behalf of the Respondent, learned Senior State Counsel in her written

submissions, referring to the evidence of the virtual complainant, submitted

the following: “… it is also evident that the virtual complainant had initially given

it much thought and she was initially reluctant to give the Petitioner (sic) the said sum

of money … However, the Petitioner (sic) had then provided the virtual complainant

with a cheque as an assurance that the said sum of money would be returned by the

Petitioner (sic) … In fact, the virtual complainant has also stated that the Petitioner

(sic) had insisted on her taking the cheque … As a result of the said assurance, the

virtual complainant had finally decided that the Petitioner (sic) could be trusted to

return the said amount. The money had therefore been given to the Petitioner (sic) on

25th September 2007 …”

Learned Senior State Counsel also drew the attention of this Court to

illustration “(d)” of section 398 of the Penal Code, and submitted that, “the

aforesaid illustration matches the exact circumstances of the present case, as the

Petitioner (sic) had essentially forced the cheque in issue on the virtual complainant as

Page 11 of 35

an instrument of inducement (knowing that the said cheque could not be encashed) to

deliver the sum of money to him.”

Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the tendering of a cheque from

an account which had already been closed several months prior, is reflective of

the dishonest intention on the part of the Appellant. It was further submitted

that the Appellant had no intention of repaying the virtual complainant. The

Appellant intended to cause loss to the virtual complainant and thereby the

mens rea of the offence of ‘cheating’ is satisfied.

Learned Senior State Counsel citing Arvindbhai Ravjibhai Patel v. State of Gujarat

(1998 Cr.L.J. 463) submitted that it has been held that, “if after taking a loan, for

a considerable period the same is not paid till the date the complaint is filed, then from

that point of time it can be prima facie said that he had the dishonest intention of not

to pay right from the beginning. If the law is not interpreted in this manner, dishonest

persons would screamingly skip the law and defeat the justice”.

The position of the learned Senior State Counsel is that the tendering of the

cheque would have ‘undoubtedly reassured the virtual complainant into providing

the petitioner (sic) the loan’. Thus, by tendering the cheque, the Appellant had

‘deceived’ the virtual complainant. The presentation of the cheque induced the

virtual complainant to deliver to the Appellant the property, namely the loan

of Rs. 800,000/=.

The written submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent also contained the

following paragraph:

“Further, it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner (sic) has had multiple connected

matters pertaining to similar offences which were pending at the time (Case Nos,

Page 12 of 35

68674, 68676 & B 354/2008 - at page 40, High Court Appeal Brief marked ‘X’), as

well as a previous conviction from the Magistrate’s Court of Ratnapura in Case No.

68673 (at page 82, High Court Appeal Brief marked ‘X’). These facts indubitably go

towards the Petitioner’s character, that he is a repeat offender who has engaged in

cheating persons in a manner similar to that in which he cheated the virtual

complainant in this matter.”

In the light of these submissions, learned Senior State Counsel submitted that

the charge of ‘cheating’ has been clearly proven by the prosecution, and

therefore submitted that the conviction of the Appellant for having committed

cheating was lawful, and hence the Appeal be dismissed.

Consideration of the law, evidence, submissions and conclusions

Offence of ‘Cheating’

Section 398 of the Penal Codes defines the offence of Cheating in the following

manner:

“Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the

person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any

person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do

or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and

which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in

body, mind, reputation, or property, or damage or loss to the Government, is said to

‘cheat’.” (Emphasis added.)

From this definition, it is evident that the offence of ‘cheating’ can be committed

in several ways. The focus here is not on the modus operandi that may be

adopted by the perpetrator of the offence, but on technical ways recognized by

Page 13 of 35

the Penal Code, as amounting to ‘cheating’. Those multiple ways in which the

offence of ‘cheating’ may be committed, are as follows:

1. By deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person

so deceived to deliver any property to any person.

2. By deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so

deceived to consent that any person shall retain any property.

3. By deceiving any person, intentionally induces the person so deceived to

do anything which he would not do if he were not so deceived, and which

act causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind,

reputation, or property, or damage or loss to the Government.

4. By deceiving any person, intentionally induces the person so deceived to

omit to do anything which he would do if he were not so deceived, and

which omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person

in body, mind, reputation, or property, or damage or loss to the

Government.

In view of the evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial and the

submissions made before this Court by both learned counsel, the manner in

which the offence of ‘cheating’ may be committed cited in “1” above is of

particular significance to the adjudication of this Appeal.

That the offence of ‘cheating’ can be committed in these four ways is reflected

clearly in Dr. Sir Hari Singh Gour’s ‘The Penal Law of India’ (Diamond Jubilee -

10th Edition, Volume IV, page 3636), which provides as follows:

“To constitute ‘cheating’ under this section, there must be -

(1) deception of any person and thereby,

(2) (a) fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person -

(i) to deliver any property to any person, or

Page 14 of 35

(ii) to consent that any person shall retain any property,

or

(2) (b) intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which if he were

not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause harm to that

person in body, mind, reputation or property.”

Thus, it is Dr. Gour’s view as well, that to constitute the offence of ‘cheating’

ingredients “(1)” and “(2)(a)” or “(2)(b)” should be satisfied.

It would therefore be seen that deception is the core ingredient of the offence

of ‘cheating’, and it is common to all four ways in which the offence may be

committed. In comparison thereof, fraudulence and dishonesty, which operate

as alternate ingredients of the offence, are expressly provided ingredients only

to the first and second ways in which the offence of ‘cheating’ may be

committed, wherein the offender induces the victim to either (a) deliver any

property to any person, or (b) to consent that any person shall retain any

property. The third and fourth ways in which the offence of ‘cheating’ may be

committed, do not contain ‘fraudulence’ or ‘dishonesty’ as constituent

ingredients. Nevertheless, it is important to note that ‘dishonesty’ is embedded

in the ingredient of ‘deception’, and hence ‘dishonesty’ is actually a requirement

for all four ways in which the offence of cheating could be committed. This

aspect will be discussed in further detail in due course.

Furthermore, with regard to the first and second ways in which the offence of

cheating may be committed, it would not be necessary for the prosecution to

prove that the victim suffered any loss or was likely to suffer any loss as a result

of being subject to the offence, though pecuniary loss or loss of property would

in most instances be a consequential result. However, with regard to the third

Page 15 of 35

and fourth ways in which the offence may be committed, it would be necessary

for the prosecution to prove a particular consequential loss or a likelihood of

such a consequential loss as a result of being subject to the offence of ‘cheating’.

Such consequential loss should be in the nature of either (i) actual damage or

harm to such person in body, mind, reputation, or property, or damage or loss

to the government, or (ii) the likelihood of causing such damage or harm to

such person in body, mind, reputation, or property, or damage of loss to the

government.

The term ‘deception’ has not been defined in the Penal Code. Black’s Law

Dictionary (11th Edition) provides two definitions to the term ‘deception’. Those

are (i) the act of deliberately causing someone to believe that something is true when

the actor knows it to be false, and (ii) a trick intended to make a person believe

something untrue. Generally, deception is carried out through making some

verbal assertion or through conduct or by a combination of both. In deception,

the verbal assertion contains falsehood which the perpetrator knows to be

false. It has the effect of misleading the victim. However, a verbal assertion of

falsehood is not absolutely essential. As the explanation to section 398 provides,

“a dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section”.

(Emphasis added.) Thus, not a mere omission to tell the truth or concealment

of the truth, but an omission or concealment with the intention of dishonestly

concealing the truth, would amount to deception. As Dr. Gour has pointed out,

deception has in it the element of misleading, or making a person believe

something that is not real. It implies causing a person to believe as true,

something that is false. (page 3637) In deception, the motive for uttering

falsehood or a false representation through other means, or the concealment of

the truth, is dishonesty. The term “dishonestly” has been defined in section 22 of

the Penal Code in the following manner:

Page 16 of 35

“Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or

wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.” Section 21(1)

provides that, “‘wrongful gain’ is gain by unlawful means of property to which the

person gaining is not legally entitled”, and section 21(2) provides that, “‘wrongful

loss’ is the loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally

entitled’. Thus, dishonesty connotes an intention to cause wrongful gain or

wrongful loss contrary to law.

It would thus be seen that deception is distinct from the utterance of mere

falsehood or failure to reveal the truth. It is not a mere misrepresentation as

well. Deception is the inducement that is provided by the perpetrator of the

offence of cheating to the victim, which should have been practiced with a

dishonest intention. Thus, ‘dishonesty’ is the mens rea of the offence of cheating

common to all four ways in which the offence may be committed.

From the structuring of the charge of ‘cheating’ preferred against the Appellant

(i.e. the first charge on the charge sheet), it would be seen that the prosecution

had premised the charge on the first out of the four ways in which I have

described above, the offence of ‘cheating’ may be committed. Thus, it is

necessary to consider whether, the prosecution has proven that the Appellant

practiced deception in respect of the virtual complainant in the manner alleged

in the charge. Whether he entertained a dishonest intention when he solicited

a loan from the virtual complainant is of critical importance. Furthermore, it is

necessary to consider whether through such deception, the Appellant had

fraudulently or dishonestly induced the virtual complainant to deliver property

to the Appellant. From the perspective of the virtual complainant, it is

necessary to consider whether it was the alleged act of deception (if any)

practiced by the Appellant, which caused the virtual complainant to deliver

Page 17 of 35

property to the Appellant. Even if the alleged offender had practiced deception,

and nonetheless quite independent of the deceptive assertion made by the

offender, the alleged victim had due to some auxiliary reason departed with

property, the offence of ‘cheating’ would not be made out. This is because, the

prosecution under such circumstances has failed to establish a causal

relationship between the deception practiced by the alleged offender and the

conduct of the victim.

It would be seen that section 398 contains only the definition of the offence of

‘cheating’. The punishment for ‘cheating’ is contained in sections 400, 401, 402

and 403 of the Penal Code. The punishment for committing ‘cheating’ is

conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain associated circumstances

stipulated in these sections. In the instant matter, the Appellant was charged

with having committed the offence of ‘cheating’, punishable in terms of section

403 of the Penal Code. Section 403 provides as follows:

“Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to

deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter, or destroy the whole or any

part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable

of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment

of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall

also be liable to fine.” (Emphasis added.)

Therefore, to be punishable in terms of section 403 of the Penal Code, it is

necessary to consider whether the prosecution has proven that as a result of

being cheated, the virtual complainant had delivered property to the

Appellant.

Analysis of the evidence and application of the law

Offence of Cheating

It is now necessary to re-visit the evidence, while applying the afore-stated

applicable legal principles. According to the virtual complainant, the

Appellant was known to the virtual complainant for some time. It is evident

that, well before the Appellant solicited a ‘loan’ from her, she had confidence

or trust in the Appellant. According to her, due to the several reasons she has

described in her testimony, she had ‘utmost trust’ in the Appellant. On 12th

September 2007, the Appellant solicited a ‘loan’ from the virtual complainant.

The prosecution did not place any evidence before Court that at the time the

loan was solicited the Appellant had undertaken to tender to the virtual

complainant a cheque, either as security or as the means by which the loan

would be repaid. When the loan was solicited by the Appellant, the virtual

complainant did not immediately indicate to the Appellant whether or not she

will accede to the request. She contemplated on the matter for some time and

at some point-of-time after the 12th of September, she seems to have decided to

grant the loan to the Appellant. The date on which she took that decision has

not been elicited from the virtual complainant. Having decided to grant the

loan to the Appellant, the virtual complainant took certain steps to collect the

required amount of money. That is because, she had only four hundred

thousand rupees with her and the amount required was eight hundred

thousand rupees. It was on the 25th September 2007 that she handed over to the

Appellant the loan amounting to eight hundred thousand rupees. It is on that

day that the Appellant drew the cheque in issue in the presence of the virtual

complainant, and handed it over to her. The prosecution has not presented

specific evidence on whether the cheque was tendered to the virtual

complainant before or after the money was given by the virtual complainant

to the Appellant. However, what is evident is that the cheque was handed over

Page 19 of 35

to the virtual complainant by the Appellant some-time after the virtual

complainant decided to lend the money to the Appellant. When the cheque

was offered, the virtual complainant told the Appellant that it (the cheque) was

not necessary, as in any event she knew that the Appellant did not have money

in the account. However, the Appellant insisted on giving the cheque, and the

virtual complainant accepted it as ‘security’. On being specifically questioned

under cross-examination by learned counsel for the accused, the virtual

complainant has testified that she gave the loan to the Appellant because she

had ‘confidence’ in him. She has at no stage stated that she gave the loan on

the belief that she considered the cheque to be valuable security and hence she

will be able to encash the cheque when she required money. Thus, it would be

seen that there is no specific evidence that the tendering of the cheque caused

the virtual complainant to decide to grant the loan to the Appellant. In the

circumstances, I am not inclined to agree with the submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel that it was as a result of tendering the cheque as an

assurance, that the virtual complainant decided to give the money to the

Appellant. Further, even if this Court were to infer that the cheque had been

given to the virtual complainant by the Appellant before the money was given

to him, that the tendering of the cheque was the governing reason which

resulted in the virtual complainant having decided to give the loan amounting

to eight hundred thousand rupees to the Appellant, remains an unresolved

issue.

At page 3641 (supra), Dr. Gour has pointed out that, ‘to constitute the offence of

cheating, there must be a deception which must precede and induce, under the first

part of this section, the delivery or retention of property, or the act or omission referred

to in the second part’.

Page 20 of 35

Views identical to Dr. Gour’s have been expressed by Justice Hearne in The

King v. Wijerama [2 CLJ 211], wherein it has been stated as follows:

“Cheating is defined in section 398 C.P.C. The indictment in the present case refers to

the first part of section 398. Under this part, in order to constitute ‘cheating’ there

must be deception which must precede and induce the delivery or retention of

property.”

It is necessary to observe that in the matter under examination by me, the

prosecution has not proved that the impugned deceptive act of the Appellant

preceded and induced the virtual complainant to lend him money.

Indeed, in The King v. Chandrasekera (23 NLR 286) it has been held by Justice

Shaw that the inducement to deliver the property need not have been wholly

due to the deceit practiced by the perpetrator of cheating, independent of other

auxiliary causes. However, the key issue to be determined is whether the

tendering of the cheque by the Appellant to the virtual complainant was

perceived by the virtual complainant as the means of recovery of the loan or as

valuable security, and hence she was thereby persuaded to grant the loan of

rupees eight hundred thousand to the Appellant because the cheque was

tendered to her. For the tendering of the cheque to have played a decisive role

on the virtual complainant having decided to give the money to the Appellant

as a loan, the cheque should have been given to the virtual complainant at or

before the time she decided to give the loan to the Appellant, or the Appellant

should have given a promise to the virtual complainant that a cheque will be

given to her if she were to give the money to him. As pointed out earlier, no

evidence has been placed before this Court to that effect.

According to the testimony provided by the Assistant Manager of the

Ratnapura Branch of the National Development Bank, the cheque in issue

bearing No. 908494 had been drawn against the Appellant’s bank account

bearing No. 01300100139. This account had been closed by the bank on 11th

January 2007, upon detecting that three cheques issued by the Appellant

against this account had been dishonoured due to want of necessary funds.

The fact that the account was being closed, had been communicated to the

Appellant. The Appellant took no steps to re-activate the account. Thus, when

the appellant drew cheque No. 908494, he knew that the corresponding

account against which the cheque was being drawn had been closed. After the

tendering of the cheque to the virtual complainant, the Appellant made no

attempt to re-activate the account and deposit sufficient funds into that account

so that there will be funds in the account to honour the cheque when the

cheque is deposited by the virtual complainant. It is under such circumstances

that in December 2007 when the virtual complainant’s son deposited the

cheque, it was dishonoured by the bank.

When the Appellant handed over the cheque to the virtual complainant and

asked her to keep it as ‘security’, he made no reference to the fact that the

relevant account had been closed by the bank. It can under these circumstances

be argued that the Appellant’s conduct of drawing and tendering the cheque

was illegal as it amounted to an offence. When tendering the cheque to the

virtual complainant, the Appellant had deliberately given the impression that

the cheque was to be kept as ‘security’, when in fact, it was not a ‘valuable

security’ as at that point of time. Nor did he take any steps afterwards to convert

the cheque in to a ‘valuable security’ by re-activating the bank account and

depositing sufficient money in it, facilitating the realization of the cheque when

it is tendered to the bank. Consequent to the receipt of loan, when he was

Page 22 of 35

obliged to return the money to the virtual complainant, the Appellant

defaulted, and also started to avoid the virtual complainant. These items of

subsequent conduct can be taken into consideration when arriving at an

inferential finding regarding the state of mind of the Appellant at the time he

accepted the money and handed over the cheque to the virtual complainant.

In my view, these circumstances by themselves are insufficient to arrive at an

inference that at the time the Appellant solicited the loan and subsequently

tendered the cheque, he entertained a dishonest intention. That is in view of

the reasonable possibility that at the time the cheque was tendered the

Appellant may have in good faith intended to repay the loan when the loan

money was due, either by tendering cash or by depositing sufficient money in

the bank account so that the cheque when tendered would be honoured. Thus,

in my view, it cannot be unequivocally concluded that the Appellant had by

the tendering of the cheque to the virtual complainant, engaged in deception of

the virtual complainant by the dishonest concealment of certain relevant facts

pertaining to the cheque and by asserting facts that gave the virtual

complainant a false impression.

In any event, it is important to note that, even if this Court were to arrive at a

finding that the tendering of the cheque and assertions made associated with

the tendering of the cheque amounts to deception, that by itself does not convert

the character of the Appellant’s conduct to the offence of ‘cheating’. As pointed

out earlier, the prosecution has failed to prove that it was the deception if any

practiced by the Appellant that thereby caused the virtual complainant to give

the solicited sum of money to the Appellant.

Page 23 of 35

As the virtual complainant herself has admitted, the transaction between

herself and the Appellant was one relating to a loan. From the perspective of

the law of contracts, there has certainly been a breach of contract by the

Appellant. According to Dr. Gour, “a mere breach of contract cannot give rise to a

criminal prosecution. The distinction between a case of mere breach of contract and one

of cheating, depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of the alleged

inducement, which must be judged by his subsequent act but of which the subsequent

act is not the sole criterion”. (page 3634, supra) Dr. Gour has also pointed out

that, “if the terms of the agreement are not carried out, it may attract civil as well as

criminal consequences. The vital factor to be considered is whether at the time of the

agreement, there was an intention to carry out the terms of the agreement or not. If at

its inception there was no intention to carry out the terms, it would constitute the

offence of ‘cheating’. Not otherwise”. (page 3635, supra) In view of the attendant

facts and circumstances of this case, it cannot be concluded beyond a

reasonable doubt that at the time of the making the request to the virtual

complainant and when receiving the eight hundred thousand rupees, the

Appellant entertained the intention of not re-paying the amount as per the

undertaking he gave to the virtual complainant.

Charge against the Appellant

Section 165(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 provides

that, “when the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in section 164

and the preceding sub-sections of this section do not give the accused sufficient notice

of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars

of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that

purpose”. Particularly in offences such as ‘cheating’ which has multiple technical

ways in which the offence may be committed, the manner in which the offence

had been committed should be specified. Illustration “(b)” of section 165

Page 24 of 35

provides as follows: ‘A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge

must set out the manner in which A cheated B.” In compliance with this

requirement, the charge against the Appellant contained the following

averment: “… by tendering to her a cheque drawn for Rs. 8,00,000/= bearing No.

908494 drawn against Account No. 013001001397 maintained at National

Development Bank, Ratnapura, and having told her that she could on the date

contained in the cheque deposit the said cheque and obtain money …”

(Emphasis added.) However, no evidence has been presented at the trial that

the Appellant made such an utterance to the virtual complainant. Therefore,

the prosecution has failed in establishing that the Appellant committed the

offence of cheating in the manner in which the prosecution has alleged in the

charge that the offence was committed. Thus, the evidence in the case is not

compatible with the charge. That is another ground on which I conclude that

the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of ‘cheating’ against the

Appellant.

I am of the view that, in the circumstances of this case, the answers to the

following questions would point towards the absence of culpability of the

Appellant for the offence of ‘cheating’.

(a) Did the Appellant entertain a dishonest intention when he solicited the loan?

(b) Based on a dishonest intention, did the Appellant practice deception by concealing

from the virtual complainant the fact that the bank account was closed and that

there was no money in the account to honour the cheque?

(c) Did the Appellant solicit the loan and thereafter borrow the money from the virtual

complainant with the intention of not repaying it?

(d) At the time the loan was solicited, did the Appellant know that he would not be in

a position to settle the loan?

Page 25 of 35

(e) While entertaining grounds to believe that he will not be in a position to settle the

loan, did the Appellant conceal from the virtual complainant the fact that he will

not be able to repay the money that was being borrowed?

(f) Did the tendering of the cheque by the Appellant to the virtual complainant result

in the virtual complainant being deceived and thereby did the virtual complainant

decide to give the money to the Appellant?

In my view, the evidence presented at the trial is insufficient to conclusively

answer any of the above questions in the affirmative. Thus, the conviction of

the Appellant cannot be affirmed.

Arvindbhai Ravjibhai Patel v. State of Gujarat

I must now deal with the citing of the judgment in Arvindbhai Ravjibhai Patel v.

State of Gujarat, by the learned Senior State Counsel in support of her

submission, that the Appellant was culpable for having committed the offence

of ‘cheating’.

The first matter I wish to observe is that, the said judgment of the High Court

of Gujarat, India, has been decided by Judge K. Vaidya sitting alone, in respect

of an application by which Arvindbhai Ravijibhai Patel sought the quashing of

an order made by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Surat. Following a

consideration of a complaint filed in the Magistrate’s Court of Surat by one

Dhirubhai Shambhubai Kakadia against Patel that the latter had cheated him

to give a loan of Rs. 90,000/=, the Magistrate had made an order directing the

Police to inquire into the complaint and report. Thus, the impugned order

made by the Magistrate challenged in the High Court was not a judgment in

respect of a conviction and sentence imposed against Patel by a Magistrate. In

the said case, what the High Court had been called upon to consider was

whether there was sufficient material before the Magistrate that would in

Page 26 of 35

terms of the applicable law warrant the Magistrate to require the police to

inquire into the complaint and report back to the Magistrate. Thus, the matter

that required adjudication by the High Court of Gujarat was not whether the

evidence disclosed proof beyond reasonable doubt as to whether the accused

(Patel) had committed the offence of ‘cheating’. It should be noted that there is

a significant difference in the threshold of evidence an appellate court is

required to consider between the two scenarios. In the matter before Judge

Vaidya, all what he was required to consider was whether the material before

the learned Magistrate disclosed well-founded information that Patel had

committed the offence of ‘cheating’, which would warrant the conduct of an

inquiry into the complaint by the police. That question had been answered in

the affirmative by Judge Vaidya. Thus, the judgment cited by learned Senior

State Counsel has been decided on a totally different context and therefore

notwithstanding the above being a judgment pronounced by a foreign court of

law, I am constrained to conclude that it is not a ‘relevant’ judgment from the

context of this matter.

The second matter that needs to be dealt with by this Court, relates to the citing

of this particular judgment of a foreign court of law. I am conscious that,

learned Senior State Counsel when citing this judgment did not invite this

Court to invoke the doctrine of judicial precedent (stare decisis) and thereby did

not invite this Court to feel legally bound by or even obliged to follow the ratio

decidendi of the cited judgment. In fact, the doctrine of judicial precedent does

not require a Court of a sovereign and independent country to be bound by a

judgment of a foreign country, notwithstanding the foreign judgment having

been pronounced by a relatively superior Court in the comparative judicial

hierarchies of the two countries. In fact, being legally bound to follow a

judgment of a Court of another country would be inconsistent with the

Page 27 of 35

sovereignty of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and Article 3 read

with Article 4 of the Constitution. Applying the doctrine of judicial precedent

in respect of a judgment of a foreign Court, even though it may be in respect

of a judgment of a relatively superior Court, would in my view also be

inconsistent with the concept of sovereignty of nation states and contrary to

Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations which recognizes the principle

of sovereign equality. However, an exception to this is found during the pre-

republican era of Sri Lanka, when Sri Lankan courts were required to be bound

by judgments of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, pronounced in

appeals to that Court from judgments of Courts of Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was

called then). That is because, the law of the country (at that time) recognized

the Privy Council to be the court of final resort.

Nevertheless, I wish to observe that the views of judges of superior courts can

considerably be enriched by considering foreign judgments and appreciating

the interpretation and application of the law by the justices who decided the

relevant judgments and the judicial wisdom contained therein. Indeed,

particularly during the embryological stage of the development of the

fundamental rights jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka gained much

from judgments pronounced by the Supreme Court of India. A careful

comparison of related judgments of the two national jurisdictions reveal how

‘judicial borrowings’ if I may use that terminology, has contributed towards the

development of the law in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Public and Administrative

Law of this country has gained significantly and exponentially from judgments

of the Privy Council and the House of Lords of the United Kingdom.

However, in view of the sheer number and the multiplicity of views contained

in judgments of foreign courts of comparable jurisdictions, unless a judge is

Page 28 of 35

extremely careful and meticulously rigorous in examining the cited judgment

in the backdrop of judgments of the same foreign jurisdiction not cited by

counsel, it is probable that such judge may succumb to the consequences of

possible cherry-picking of foreign judgments by counsel.

Be that as it may, it appears to me that the judgment in issue was cited by

learned Senior State Counsel on the assumption that this Court should

consider itself to be persuaded to follow the views expressed by Judge K.

Vaidya and thereby be guided by his views. As observed earlier, the cited

judgment is one of the High Court of the State of Gujarat, India. Based on the

hierarchy of Courts in India, the High Court of the State of India cannot be

equated to the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka. Justice Thamotheram in Walker Sons & Co. (U.K.) Ltd. v. Gunatilake and

Others [(1978-79-80) 1 Sri L.R. 231 at page 243] has expressed the view that it is

the judgments of the highest Courts of a particular country which should be

recognized as a judgment declaratory of the law of that country. I am in

respectful agreement of that view. Therefore, the judgment of Judge K. Vaidya

referred to by the learned Senior State Counsel cannot be considered as the law

on the matter in terms of the law of India.

Subject to the absence of the term ‘or damage or loss to the government’, the

offence of ‘cheating’ is defined in section 415 of the Indian Penal Code of 1860

in the identical manner in which it has been defined in the Penal Code of this

country. Further, in criminal matters, the applicable legal principles pertaining

to relevancy and admissibility of evidence, burden of proof, and judicial

practices relating to assessment of credibility and testimonial trustworthiness

of evidence of Sri Lanka and India are comparable. However, a Judgment of a

High Court of a State of India would certainly not even attract persuasive

Page 29 of 35

influence on the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Therefore, even if the facts were

identical, and the cited judgment also related to a consideration of an Appeal

arising out of a conviction and sentence imposed by a trial court relating to the

committing of the offence of ‘cheating’, I see no useful purpose having been

served by citing the judgment referred to above.

If at all, what may serve as helpful guidance to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka

would be judgments of the Supreme Court of India, in instances where the

jurisdictions of the two courts and the applicable laws are comparable.

In any event, I must place on record that Courts must exercise great caution

and apply extreme diligence when considering a judgment of a Court of a

foreign jurisdiction, as a judgment must be necessarily viewed and appreciated

in the backdrop of the applicable law, sources of law, evolution of the law,

jurisdiction of the relevant court, comparable binding judicial precedents,

subsequent developments of judicial precedents, natural and inherent conduct

of the people of that country, and the socio-cultural and other conditions and

circumstances which prevailed in such country at the time the particular

judgment was pronounced. All such relevant factors may not be apparent ex-

facie in the cited judgment and would not be within the domain of knowledge

of judges invited to consider such judgment of the relevant foreign Court.

Former Chief Justice of India Justice K. G. Balakrishnan in “The Role of Foreign

Precedents in a country’s Legal System” [National Law School of India Review,

Volume 22 (No. 1) 2010] has expressed the view that, “… judges should be

cautious against giving undue weightage to precedents decided in entirely different

socio-political settings. … reliance on foreign precedents should also be shaped by the

Page 30 of 35

discipline expected of a common law judge in weighing the credibility and persuasive

value of precedents from different legal systems”.

From that perspective too, the judgment cited by learned Senior State Counsel

provides hardly any assistance for the determination of this Appeal, and must

be classified as being ‘irrelevant’. In the circumstances, it would be necessary to

call upon counsel to refrain from citing judgments of foreign jurisdictions that

do not have any relevance to the case at hand required to be decided by a Sri

Lankan Court.

Antecedents and the character of the Appellant

As referred to earlier, learned Senior State Counsel citing certain journal entries

and proceedings of the case, submitted that the Appellant had several

connected cases relating to several similar offences and that he had been once

convicted of having committed an offence. Her submission was that these facts

‘indubitably go toward the Petitioner’s [sic] character, that he is a repeat offender who

has engaged in cheating persons in a manner similar to that in which he cheated the

virtual complainant in this matter”. It appears from the said submission that the

Respondent’s position is that, the said antecedents amounting to bad character

of the Appellant should be taken into account for the purpose of considering

the lawfulness or otherwise of the conviction that is impugned by the

Appellant in this Appeal.

Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance provides as follows:

In criminal proceedings the fact that the accused person has a bad character is

irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he has a good character, in which case

it becomes relevant.” Explanations 1 and 2 of section 54 provide that this section

does not apply to cases in which the bad character of any person is itself a fact

Page 31 of 35

in issue and that in such cases a previous conviction is relevant

notwithstanding such evidence amounting to evidence of bad character.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in “The Law of Evidence” (Volume I, page 684) has

aptly summarized the position of the law in this regard in the following

manner: “Section 54 lays down the general rule that in criminal proceedings, the fact

that the accused has a bad character is irrelevant, except in exceptional cases mentioned

therein. Evidence may not be given of the accused’s previous convictions and

misconduct on other occasions for the purpose of supporting an argument that he is

the kind of person who would commit the crime charged. As Wigmore puts it, “the

rule, then, firmly and universally established in policy and tradition is that the

prosecution may not initially attack the defendant’s character”.” Lord Sumner in

Thompson v. Rex [(1918) A.C. 232] has held that, “no one doubts that it does not

tend to prove a man guilty of a particular crime to show that he is the kind of man who

would commit a crime or that he is generally disposed to crime and even to a particular

crime’. In Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales [(1894) A.C. 57] it has

been held by Lord Herschell that, it is not competent for the prosecution to

adduce evidence tending to show that the accused had been guilty of criminal

acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to

the conclusion that he is likely, from his criminal conduct or character to have

committed the offence, for which he is being tried.

This is not a case where the character of the accused was a fact in issue. Indeed,

in such cases, evidence relating to the bad character of the accused can be

presented by the prosecution. Nor had the accused acting in terms of section

52 of the Evidence Ordinance presented to court evidence of his good

character. In such instances, evidence amounting to the bad character of the

accused can be presented to rebut the evidence presented on behalf of the

accused. Thus, neither of these two situations are applicable.

Page 32 of 35

The third situation whether the presentation of evidence which may amount

to evidence of bad character may be relevant, would be instances where the

prosecution seeks to present evidence in terms of sections 14 or 15 of the

Evidence Ordinance for the purpose of establishing the existence of a particular

state of mind of the accused at the time of committing of the offence which

would constitute the means rea of the offence, or for the purpose of establishing

a state of body or bodily feeling. Towards this objective evidence which may

amount to bad character of the accused may be led, as well as evidence of

similar occurrences involving the accused, commonly referred to as system

evidence. Illustrations “(a)”, “(b)” and “(c)” of section 14 and illustration “(c)” of

section 15 provide ample illustration of this principle of evidence. However, in

such situations too, evidence which amounts to bad character of the accused

would be permitted by court only in exceptional circumstances if the

prosecution can show a high degree of probative force in such evidence, the

principle being that the court should protect the accused against the

consequential prejudicial impact arising out of such evidence of bad character.

The fourth and the final circumstances under which evidence which may

amount to bad character of the accused may be relevant, would be for the

purpose of establishing the ‘cause’ and the ‘motive’ for the committing of an

offence, which would be relevant in terms of sections 7 and 8(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance, respectively. Illustration “(a)” of section 8 which provides that,

“when ‘A’ is tried for the murder of ‘B’, the facts that ‘A’ murdered ‘C’, that ‘B’ knew

that ‘A’ had murdered ‘C’, and that ‘B’ had tried to extort money from ‘A’ by

threatening to make his knowledge public, are relevant”, amply exemplifies the

position of the law in this regard. However, even when evidence which may

amount to bad character of the accused is sought to be presented by the

Page 33 of 35

prosecution as means of establishing the ‘cause’ and or the ‘motive’ for

committing the offence, the trial Court must exercise great caution in ensuring

that the probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.

It would be seen that the circumstances cited above by the learned Senior State

Counsel which in any event has not been presented as ‘evidence’ before the

learned Magistrate, do not come within any of the four situations described

above, which make evidence of bad character relevant and admissible.

Therefore, consideration of such factors submitted by the learned Senior State

Counsel would be obnoxious to the law and hence this court refrains from

doing so.

Impugned judgments of the High Court and the Magistrate’s Court

It is a matter of regret that the learned Magistrate who found the Appellant

guilty as charged in respect of all three offences, has not considered the

evidence led by the prosecution from the perspective of the ingredients of the

offences the Appellant had been charged with. After arriving at determinations

regarding the credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of the witnesses who

testified at the trial, a trial judge must necessarily consider the evidence from

the perspective of the constituent ingredients of the offence the accused has

been charged with. Having identified witnesses who are credible, the trial

judge must conclude whether their testimony is trustworthy. He must

thereafter apply the evidence emanating from such credible and trustworthy

witnesses, to the ingredients of the offence, and consider and arrive at a

conclusion on whether the available evidence would be sufficient to prove the

ingredients of the offence. If following a consideration of the evidence for the

prosecution, the learned trial judge arrives at an affirmative finding, he must

thereafter consider the totality of the evidence presented by both the

Page 34 of 35

prosecution and the defence and determine whether the prosecution has

proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned High Court judge has proceeded on the footing that, the Appellant

had by tendering the cheque and giving an undertaking to the virtual

complainant that the amount obtained as a loan would be returned as

promised, had thereby created a belief in the mind of the virtual complainant

that the money would be returned, and had therefore committed the offence

of cheating. The learned High Court judge has also not considered the impact

arising out of the pre-existing confidence / trust the virtual complainant had

towards the Appellant. Nor has the learned High Court Judge considered

whether the conduct of the Appellant amounted to deception, whether it was

such deceptive conduct which resulted in the virtual complainant giving the

money to the Appellant, and whether the Appellant entertained a dishonest

intention.

In view of the foregoing, I answer the questions of law presented to this Court

in the following manner:

(i) The Provincial High Court had failed to analyse whether the evidence led

at the trial justifies the conclusion that the Appellant entertained the

requisite mens rea of the offence of cheating, which in view of the manner in

which the charge had been framed and the evidence presented by the

prosecution was a dishonest intention.

(ii) The Provincial High Court had failed to analyze and conclude that the

virtual complainant had not been deceived by the impugned conduct of the

Appellant, which is a necessary ingredient to constitute a charge of cheating.

Page 35 of 35

In view of the above, I conclude that both the judgments of the High Court and

the Magistrate’s Court are against the weight of the evidence and are not

lawful.

In the circumstances, I allow this Appeal. Accordingly, I acquit the Appellant

of the charge of cheating.
