JUDGMENT

YASANTHA KODAGODA, PC, J.

This judgment relates to an Appeal from a Judgment of the High Court of the Provinces

of the Western Province holden in Avissawella, setting aside a Judgment of the District

Court of Homagama.

At the argument stage before us, the Respondent was absent and unrepresented. This

Court took up this matter for argument, after satisfying ourselves that the Appellant has

on three occasions complied with directives issued by this Court in issuing Notice of this

Appeal to the Respondent. In fact, Notices had been dispatched to the Respondent

immediately after this Appeal was filed, immediately before the Application was taken

up for consideration for the granting of leave to appeal, and thereafter following the

matter being fixed for Argument. The Respondent did not respond to any of these

Notices, and therefore this Court concluded that the defended is not interested in

vindicating her position or defending the judgment delivered in her favour by the High

Court.

Plaint, Answer and the Issues

On 23

rd October 2009, the Plaintiff – Respondent – Appellant filed Plaint in the District

Court of Homagama stating the following:

That the Plaintiff is a company carrying out amongst other business activities, the

running of a private hospital named Pannipitiya Nursing Home.

That the Defendant joined the Plaintiff company as a Probationary Trainee. At

the time the Defendant joined the Plaintiff company, the parties entered into a

Service Agreement dated 16

th October 2004 (a copy of which was attached to the

Plaint marked “P1”).

4

That the said agreement contained amongst others the following three conditions,

namely, (i) there shall be a training programme of two years duration for which

the cost would be borne by the Plaintiff, (ii) following the completion of the

training, the Defendant shall serve the Plaintiff for a period of five years, and (iii)

if the agreement is breached, the Defendant shall pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/= to

the Plaintiff.

That the Defendant commenced the afore-stated training programme on 16

th

October, 2004.

That while serving the Plaintiff, with effect from 18

th July 2008, without any prior

notice, the Defendant ceased to report for work.

That two attempts made in writing to contact the Defendant failed.

That since the Defendant has breached a condition of the afore-stated agreement,

she is obliged to pay the Plaintiff a sum of Rs. 50,000/=, and that she is estopped

from pleading that she cannot pay the Plaintiff the said sum.

That in view of the foregoing, a cause of action has arisen to the Plaintiff to

institute legal action to claim a sum of Rs. 50,000/= from the Defendant, together

with legal interest thereon.

Wherefore, the Plaintiff prayed that Judgment and Decree be entered against the

Defendant in favour of the Plaintiff, directing the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff a

sum of Rs. 50,000/=, together with legal interest thereon.

In response, by Answer dated 18

th May 2010, the Defendant – Appellant – Respondent

took up the following position:

That the Plaintiff did not provide any service training or education to the

Defendant, and that by observing the conduct of senior personnel, the Defendant

secured an understanding regarding the work of a hospital laboratory.

That the Plaintiff did not conduct itself according to the agreement marked “P1”

and that the said Agreement had been prepared to shield itself from labour and

other laws of the country, that therefore the said Agreement was a sham contract,

and thus based on such Agreement, it was not possible to institute legal action

against the Defendant.

That without providing training to the Defendant as provided in the afore-stated

Agreement, and without issuing a formal letter of appointment and sufficient

wages, the Plaintiff had retained the services of the Defendant.

5

Wherefore, the Defendant prayed that the Plaintiff’s case be dismissed.

On 30

th July 2010, on behalf of the Plaintiff, the following issues were raised:

(1) Whether the Defendant has breached the conditions of Agreement marked

“P1”?

(2) If so, whether the Plaintiff was entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Plaint?

The issues raised on behalf of the Defendant were the following:

(3) Whether the Plaintiff had breached the conditions of Agreement marked

‘P1’?

(4) Was the afore-stated agreement entered into, in order to enable the Plaintiff

to shield itself from the industrial laws of the country?

(5) Was the afore-stated agreement intended not to be enforced and thus was a

sham agreement?

(6) Did the Plaintiff obtain the services of the Defendant without providing her

with training as provided in Agreement marked ‘P1’, without issuing her a

letter of appointment and adequate wages?

(7) If the afore-stated issues are answered in the affirmative, can the Plaintiff

obtain the reliefs prayed for in the Plaint?

Plaintiff’s case

During the trial, the Administrative Officer of the Plaintiff company Shakila Nayana

Kumari testified on behalf of the Plaintiff. According to her testimony, following an

advertisement calling for applications, the Defendant had submitted an application for

the post of ‘Laboratory Technician’, and following an interview, she had been selected

for training for the post ‘Probationary Laboratory Technician’. Under cross-examination,

the witness has clarified that, the Defendant was recruited on 16

th October 2004. This

position tallies with the date on which Agreement “P1” has been entered into. At the

stage of recruitment, the Plaintiff had entered into an agreement with the Defendant,

marked “P1”.

Following recruitment, a two years training had been provided to the Defendant.

Subsequently, the Defendant had been confirmed in the position. After approximately

3½ years of service, the Defendant had presented a written request to leave the

6

organization. It had been explained to the Defendant that she could not leave the

organization in view of the agreement entered into. Subsequently, the Defendant had

ceased to report for duty. Under cross-examination, the witness has stated that the

defendant ceased to report for work with effect from 18

th July 2008. Thereafter, two letters

had been sent to her for no avail.

Under cross-examination, it had been suggested to the witness that no formal laboratory

training was provided to the Defendant by the Plaintiff with the aid of trained laboratory

technicians and qualified doctors. The witness has denied this suggestion. The witness

has stated the names of two doctors and two senior laboratory technicians who

participated as trainers. Learned Counsel for the Defendant has suggested to the witness

that no trainers had participated in the training programme including those whose names

were revealed as having functioned as trainers. This suggestion has also been denied by

the witness. However, during the argument stage, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff –

Respondent - Appellant submitted to this Court that, what was provided to the Defendant

was an ‘on the job training’. That, such a training was provided by serving technicians of

the organization, has not been seriously contested by learned Counsel for the Defendant,

when he cross-examined the witness. In fact, the witness’s cross-examination seems to

have been aimed at establishing that fact and that no formal training by external trainers

was provided to the Defendant.

The witness has also testified regarding the conduct of an examination at the end of the

training period. The examination had been conducted by three doctors. They had

reported that the Defendant lacked ‘theoretical knowledge’. The position taken up by

learned Counsel for the Plaintiff – Respondent – Appellant during the appeal hearing

before us, was that as the Defendant was not successful at the afore-stated examination,

her training period was extended. The witness also took up the position that, following

an extended training period of three months, the Plaintiff had deemed the Defendant to

have been successful at the examination. However, the witness has not stated with effect

from when the Plaintiff had successfully completed the training programme. Neither oral

nor documentary evidence to that effect had been presented at the trial. The witness’s

position was that, before the certificate of ‘completion of training’ could be issued, the

Defendant had ceased to report for work.

7

Under cross-examination, the witness has admitted that, the Defendant was not issued

with a ‘letter of appointment’. The witness has clarified that, a letter of appointment was

not issued, because the Defendant had been required to enhance her theoretical

knowledge. The witness has admitted that, following the training, the Defendant had not

been issued with a certificate of ‘successful completion of training’. The position of the

witness was that, at a particular point of time, the Defendant was placed on the salary

scale of a Medical Laboratory Technician. When questioned by the learned Counsel for

the Defendant as to why the Defendant was paid the salary of a Medical Laboratory

Technician without issuing a ‘letter of appointment’, the witness had no answer to give.

It has also been suggested to the witness that it was the Plaintiff who breached Agreement

marked “P1”. This suggestion has also been denied by the witness. The witness has stated

that the Defendant handed over to her a ‘letter of resignation’, stating that she was leaving

due to personal reasons. However, this letter was not produced at the trial. No other

evidence had been presented on behalf of the Plaintiff company.

Defendant’s case

The Defendant had testified on her behalf. She has admitted having entered into “P1”

with the Plaintiff. Following recruitment, she had been initially assigned to the ‘emergency

treatment unit’ and had attended to miscellaneous functions of that unit. She had

thereafter been assigned to the location where blood samples are obtained. At that

location, she had attended to functions such as writing bills and taking samples to the

laboratory. She had thereafter requested that she be given the opportunity of taking blood

samples, and subsequently she had received that opportunity. She implied thereby that

she obtained ‘on the job training’ in that regard. She emphasized that she did not receive

any formal training either in the form of lectures or practical training. After some time

working at the Plaintiff company, she had been assigned to the laboratory. At the

laboratory, she had through her own observation and with the assistance of seniors who

worked at the laboratory, gradually learnt various functions associated with testing of

samples.

The Defendant has testified with regard to an incident where she had tendered a letter

to the management requesting that an acknowledgement be issued that she handed over

the originals of her educational certificates, and containing an undertaking that the

company would release them to the Defendant when required. This request had resulted

8

in the head of the organization having scolded her. Following that incident, she had

decided to leave the organization. Afterwards, she had submitted a letter giving one

months notice of her intended resignation. She claims to have thereafter been subjected

to maltreatment. Thus, she had ceased to report for work.

In her evidence, the Defendant was emphatic that she (a) did not receive formal training

for a duration of two years, (b) was not subjected to an examination (formal assessment)

following a period of formal training, and (c) did not receive a letter confirming her in

service.

The cross-examination of the Defendant by learned Counsel for the Plaintiff has been

aimed at primarily establishing five matters, namely (i) that the Defendant received ‘on

the job’ training, (ii) that the Defendant did not successfully complete the training

programme as evident by the findings of the three consultant medical specialists who

assessed her, (iii) that during her service at the Plaintiff company the Defendant was paid

a salary, (iv) that the Plaintiff did not violate Agreement marked “P1”, and (v) that the

Defendant acted in violation of Agreement marked “P1”. As regards ‘(i)’ and ‘(ii)’, the

Plaintiff disagreed with the position taken up by learned counsel for the Plaintiff. Her

position was that, she did not receive a formal training as provided for in “P1”, and that

her performance was not properly assessed. She has not contested the suggestion that she

was paid a salary. Her position was that, while she did not act contrary to “P1”, and that

it was the Plaintiff who acted in breach of the said Agreement.

Judgment of the District Court

Following the conclusion of evidence, on 18

th February 2013, the learned District Judge

delivered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. In the said judgment, the learned District

Judge has taken into consideration the facts that, the Defendant has admitted that (i) in

terms of Agreement marked “P1”, the Defendant had been enrolled by the Plaintiff to a

laboratory technician training programme, (ii) the said Agreement stipulated a training

period of 2 years, (iii) following such training period, the Defendant was required to serve

the Plaintiff for a further period of 5 years, and (iii) if the Defendant were to cease to

work for the Plaintiff prior to the 7 years cumulative period, in terms of the Agreement,

she was liable to pay the Plaintiff a sum of Rs. 50,000/=. Thus, the learned District Judge

has arrived at the finding that the Defendant has intentionally breached a condition of

9

the Agreement marked “P1”, and that on a balance of probabilities, the Plaintiff has

established its case against the Defendant. The the learned District Judge has answered

the 1

st and 2

nd issues in the affirmative, 3

rd, 4

th, 5

th and 6

th issues in the negative, and has held

that the Defendant cannot in any event prove the 7

th issue in the affirmative. Accordingly,

the learned District Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for,

and has accordingly granted the Plaintiff the relief prayed for.

Judgment of the High Court of the Provinces

Against the Judgment of the District Court, the Defendant appealed to the High Court

of the Provinces holden in Avissawella. Following hearing of the Appeal, on 12

th

November 2015, the learned Judge of the High Court delivered Judgment allowing the

Appeal with costs payable to the Defendant by the Plaintiff at Rs. 10,000/=. The learned

High Court Judge has laid emphasis on the fact that, the obligation on the part of the

Defendant to serve the Plaintiff for a period of 5 years would arise only after completion

of the training period. According to Agreement marked “P1”, at the end of the training

period, a ‘written and oral examination’ should be held. Such an examination has not

been held. The learned Judge has further held that, in any event, the contractual

obligation of serving the Plaintiff for 5 years would arise only after the Defendant passed

the afore-stated examination. In the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has

concluded that, it was in fact the Plaintiff who had breached Agreement marked “P1”,

and thus no cause of action had accrued in favour of the Plaintiff. Therefore, the learned

Judge of the High Court has concluded that the learned District Judge had erred in

holding with the Plaintiff and granting relief. Thus, he has while allowing the Appeal,

dismissed the Plaintiff’s action with costs.

Grant of leave and question of law

On 28

th March 2017, following the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff – Respondent –

Petitioner supporting the Petition seeking the grant of leave to appeal, this Court had

granted leave to appeal on the following question of law:

“Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in coming to the finding that the

Petitioner (sic ‘Appellant’) acting in breach of the Agreement “P1” failed to hold

a written and oral examination, contrary to the evidence that the Respondent’s

work had been evaluated by three consultant doctors, which clearly amount to a

10

proper examination of the skills acquired by the Respondent as a trainee

laboratory technician?”

Analysis of the evidence, application of the law and conclusions

In order to decide this matter, it is necessary to carefully examine the clauses of

Agreement marked “P1”. According to Clause 1 of “P1”, which has been titled ‘Service

Contract’, the Plaintiff has been designated as the ‘employer’ and the Defendant as the

‘trainee’. It further states that, the trainee (Defendant) had entered a ‘training programme’

relating to the position ‘laboratory technician’. The afore-stated ‘training’ will be provided

at the expense of the employer (Plaintiff). The said ‘training programme’ shall be of 24

months duration, at the end of which, the trainee (Defendant) shall sit for a ‘written and

oral examination’ that will be held and is required to pass the said examination. Clause 2

of the Agreement provides that, following the passing of the afore-stated examination, the

trainee shall serve the employer at the Pannipitiya Medical Services (Pvt.) Ltd in the

position of ‘Laboratory Technician’ for a period of 5 years. Should the trainee be

unsuccessful at passing the afore-stated examination, the trainee shall serve the employer

in a different position. Clause 2 does not state the duration of employment in the alternate

position, should the trainee be unsuccessful at passing the afore-stated examination.

Clause 3 provides that, (a) upon successful passing of the afore-stated examination, when

the trainee commences functioning in the position ‘Laboratory Technician’, or (b) if the

trainee is unsuccessful at the examination when functioning in the alternate position that

is given to her, she would agree to contribute 8% of her salary as the ‘trust fund

contribution’ and contribute towards a ‘security deposit’. Clause 4 of the Agreement

provides that, should the Agreement be breached under whatsoever circumstances, the

trainee (Defendant) shall pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/= to the employer (Plaintiff). Clause 4

further provides that, should the trainee leave the training without completion or should

she be expelled from the training on disciplinary grounds, the trainee shall pay the

employer (Plaintiff) a sum of money stipulated by the employer as being the cost of the

training.

From the relief prayed in the Plaint, it is evident that the Plaintiff has sought a decree

from the District Court for liquidated damages. This according to the Plaint and the

evidence presented on behalf of the Plaintiff arises out of the Defendant having failed to

perform the obligation contained in clause 2 of the agreement by ceasing to work for the

11

Plaintiff prior to the expiry of 5 years following the conduct of the examination. It is

necessary to observe that, ‘working for the employer for 5 years post passing of the

examination’ or ‘working for the employer for an unspecified period in an alternate

position following the trainee being unsuccessful at the examination’ as provided in clause

2 of the agreement on the one hand, are alternate obligations conferred on the Defendant

by agreement marked “P1”. According to the Plaintiff, it is the first of these two

obligations the Plaintiff claims the Defendant defaulted. Further, the Plaintiff alleges that,

the Defendant failed to comply with the ensuing obligation of making a payment of Rs.

50,000/= prior to her premature departure from service at the Pannipitiya Nursing

Home.

An analysis of the evidence presented before the learned District Judge is necessary to

determine whether the Plaintiff is entitled in law to the relief of liquidated damages against

the Defendant.

There is in my view cogent evidence on the following matters: On 16

th October 2004, the

Defendant had been recruited by the Plaintiff as a ‘Trainee Laboratory Technician’.

Following her recruitment as a ‘trainee’, the Plaintiff has provided some form of training

to the Defendant. As opposed to providing to the Defendant a formal training

programme, I am inclined to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the

Appellant that, what was provided was an ‘on the job training’. Though the learned

Counsel for the Defendant during cross-examination of the witness of the Plaintiff and

the Defendant during her testimony had sought to impeach the case for the Plaintiff on

the footing that a formal training programme was not provided to the Defendant, it is my

view that as the Agreement marked “P1” does not specify the nature and the content of

the training programme that the employer (Plaintiff) was obligated to provide the trainee

(Defendant), it cannot be successfully proved that the Plaintiff breached “P1” by not

making arrangements for the Defendant to follow a ‘formal training programme’, and for

having provided only a ‘on the job training’.

As depicted in “P7”, “P8” and “P9”, on 18

th March 2008, the Defendant had been

subjected to an ‘assessment’ by two Consultant Pathologists and a Consultant

Microbiologist / Virologist. Though not established in the form of direct evidence, from

the date appearing immediately below the signature on “P7”, it can be inferred that this

12

examination had been held on 18

th March 2008. Out of the three assessors, while

Consultant Pathologist Dr. Geethika Jayaweera and Consultant Microbiologist and

Virologist Dr. Geethani Wickramasinghe have in their report under the category

‘comment’ reported that they recommend the “promotion”, Consultant Pathologist Dr.

A. Eleyperuma has reported that the Defendant “needs to improve in the theoretical

knowledge”. The Agreement (“P1”) provides clearly that, following a “training

programme” of 24 months duration, the employer would subject the trainee to a “written

and oral examination”. It is thus clear that, whereas Agreement “P1” requires an

assessment to be conducted upon the expiry of 24 months of training, the afore-stated

assessment had been held following a period of approximately 40 months. Furthermore,

the nature of the assessment to be conducted upon the expiry of 24 months of training

has been described in “P1” as a “written and oral examination”. However, the assessment

carried out by the three medical specialists regarding the Defendant can only be

described as a ‘viva voice’ or an ‘oral examination’. The Plaintiff has offered no evidence

that a ‘written examination’ was held. Thus, both as regards the time at which the

assessment ought to have been carried out, as well as the nature of the assessment, it is

clear that the Plaintiff has acted in breach of Clause 1 of the Agreement.

The position of the Plaintiff is that, as the Defendant was not successful at the afore-stated

examination held on 18

th March 2008, the ‘training period’ of the Defendant was

extended. The Plaintiff sought to justify the extension of the training period of the

Defendant, based on the comment made by Dr. A. Eleyperuma. It seems that, it was Dr.

A. Eleyperuma’s comment that resulted in the Plaintiff deciding to extend the ‘on the job

training’. The Plaintiff’s position is that at some stage thereafter, they deemed that the

Defendant had successfully completed the training. Though the witness for the Plaintiff

has taken up that position, it appears that no formal assessment similar to the assessment

carried out on 18

th March 2008 had been held thereafter. No explanation in that regard

has been provided, either. Further, witness Shakila Nayana Kumari has also taken up the

position that the head of ‘laboratory services’ reported that the Defendant had developed

to a stage where she could face a re-examination. Nevertheless, a re-examination has not

been conducted. Nor had a formal entry been made reflecting that the Defendant had

successfully completed the extended period of training. Furthermore, the Plaintiff has

also failed to acknowledge the fact that the Defendant had successfully completed the

training, by issuing the Defendant a certificate of completion of training or a formal letter

13

of appointment signaling the completion of her training period and or completion of the

period of probation. In fact, the position of the Plaintiff as provided by the Administrative

Officer is that, a letter of appointment was not issued to the Defendant, because she had

not successfully completed the training. Thus, this Court must necessarily conclude that,

there is no cogent evidence that the Defendant had successfully completed the extended

period of training, and thereby assumed duties of the substantive post of ‘Laboratory

Technician’, at any time preceding her having ceased to report for work.

Be that as it may, Clause 2 of the Agreement specifically provides as to what the employer

should do, if the trainee is unsuccessful at the ‘written and oral examination’. It provides

that should the trainee be unsuccessful, the trainee shall accept a different appointment

that will be given by the employer to her. “P1” does not provide for an extension of the

training programme. Therefore, in terms of the Agreement, the employer (Plaintiff) was

not contractually entitled to extend the period of training on the premise that the trainee

was unsuccessful at the examination. Thus, the afore-stated ‘extension’ of training period

also amounts to a breach of the terms of the Agreement marked ‘P1’.

According to Clause 2 of the Agreement, the obligation cast on the trainee (Defendant)

to serve the employer (Plaintiff) for a period of 5 years arises only upon the trainee

successfully passing the afore-stated ‘written and oral examination’. The Plaintiff has not

presented any evidence at the trial to establish that the Defendant passed such an

examination at any point of time subsequent to the extension of the training period. Thus,

there is no basis in terms of the Agreement to allege that the Defendant breached “P1”

by not serving the Plaintiff for a period of 5 years following successful passing of the

‘written and oral examination’.

In view of the foregoing, I conclude that the Agreement between the Plaintiff and the

Defendant had been breached by the Plaintiff by its failure to comply with a substantial

part of his obligations towards the Defendant, prior to the impugned failure on the part

of the Defendant taking place. The impugned breach on the part of the Defendant is

intrinsically linked and indivisible with the obligations on the part of the Plaintiff which

the Plaintiff failed to fulfill. The fulfilment of the obligation cast on the Defendant

contained in clause 2 of the Agreement is founded upon the Plaintiff fulfilling his

obligations contained in clause 2 of the Agreement, which as pointed above by me was

14

not fulfilled. The failure to either treat the Defendant as having been successful at the

assessment and appoint her as a Laboratory Technician or in the alternative treat her as

having been unsuccessful at the assessment and appointed her to an alternate position,

goes into the root of the Agreement and is necessarily linked to the obligation cast on the

Defendant to serve the Plaintiff for the stipulated time period. The breach on the part of

the Plaintiff is inseparable with obligation cast on the Defendant to serve the Plaintiff.

Therefore, I hold that, the Plaintiff had breached the Agreement well before the

impugned failure on the part of the Defendant. In the circumstances, the Defendant was

entitled to treat herself as having been discharged from her contractual obligations and

thus was contractually entitled unilaterally terminate working at the Pannipitiya Nursing

Home prior to the expiry of the stipulated 5 years period.

In this instance, the Plaintiff has sought liquidated damages as provided for in Clause 4

of the Agreement marked “P1”. The grant of relief in the nature of liquidated damages

arise only in instances where the Plaintiff had fulfilled his contractual obligations towards

the Defendant and not breached the Agreement. As pointed out above, it is evident that

in this instance, the Plaintiff had breached the Agreement well before the impugned

breach by the Defendant. In such circumstances, the Plaintiff would not be entitled for

liquidated damages.

In this regard, it is pertinent to recall an observation made by Justice Sisira De Abrew in

Wickrema Pathiranage Mahesh Ruwan Pathirana v. Ginthota Sarukkale Vitharange

Hemalatha Piyathilaka Ginthota (SC Appeal 218/2014, SC Minutes 15.02.2017) wherein

he has held as follows: “It is an accepted principle in law that the wrongdoer is not

permitted to take advantage of his own wrongful acts. This principle is applicable to a

case of breach of contract”.

It would also be seen that the learned High Court Judge was quite correct in holding that

the Plaintiff – Respondent had acted in breach of the Agreement marked “P1” by not

conducting a ‘written and oral examination’. As explained by me above, the assessment

held on 8

th March 2008 carried out by three medical specialists, can only be recognized

as an ‘oral examination’ which is short of the nature of the examination provided for by

the Agreement marked “P1”. Thus, I must answer the question of law referred to above,

in the negative.

15

In the foregoing circumstances and the conclusions reached by me, I dismiss this Appeal,

while upholding the Judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the Appeal Dismissed.
