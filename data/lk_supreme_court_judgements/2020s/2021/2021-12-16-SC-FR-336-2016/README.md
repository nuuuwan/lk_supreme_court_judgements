P Padman Surasena J

Petitioners are police officers and retired police officers claiming to have been

politically victimized during the period 1994 to 31-07-2014 by successive

Governments.

Consequent to the change of Government in 2015 the then Cabinet of Ministers,

having considered the Memorandum dated 09-03-2015,1 under the title To provide

relief to those who were victimized for political reasons, submitted by the then Prime

1 Produced marked P 1.

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 24 of 32

Minister, decided on 08-04-2015 to issue a Public Administration Circular to provide a

reasonable period of time for those officers, if any, who have been subjected to

political victimization and who wish to seek relief, but not yet submitted their appeals,

to submit their appeals. The Cabinet of Ministers also decided to authorize the

Secretary Ministry of Public Administration to appoint an official committee comprising

of three retired public officers who had served in the capacity of Additional Secretary

or any other similar or higher post to examine the said appeals and make

recommendations. The Petitioners have produced the said cabinet decision made on

08-04-2015, marked P 2.

As authorized by the said cabinet decision, the Secretary Ministry of Public

Administration had issued the Public Administration circular No. 09/2015 dated 17-04-

2015, calling for appeals to be submitted to the Ministry of Public Administration by

05-05-2015. The Petitioners have produced the said Public Administration circular No.

09/2015 marked P 3.

The Minister of Public Order and Christian Affairs had appointed Gamini

Siyambalapitiya (retired Additional Secretary), Kinsley Ekanayake (Former Senior

Deputy Inspector General of Police) and Ananada Ratnaweera (Former Superintended

of Police) as members of the Political Victimization Committee by the letter dated

21-06-2015 produced marked R 1. The said letter (R 1) has been addressed to The

Secretary, Political Victimization Committee, Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, Kotte Road,

Pitakotte which is not a Government institution. Further, the said letter has not

indicated how and why either the said committee or its members came to be

appointed. Thus, the purpose of the said Political Victimization Committee appointed

by the Minister of Public Order and Christian Affairs is not clear. Be that as it may, this

committee will be hereinafter referred to as the Siyambalapitiya Committee. Said

Siyambalapitiya Committee is not a committee that has been appointed in

consequence or under any authority of any Cabinet decision.

The Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration, by the letter dated 23-06-2015

produced marked R 2 has informed the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and

Christian Affairs that a three-member committee to look in to the relief to be granted

to persons subjected to political victimization, had already been established in the

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 25 of 32

Ministry of Public Administration. In the same letter, the Secretary, Ministry of Public

Administration had agreed that the said Siyambalapitiya Committee could assist the

three-member committee set up in the Ministry of Public Administration in its work

relating to appeals pertaining to the officers coming under the Ministry of Public Order

and Christian Affairs. The said letter R 2 had asked the Secretary of the Ministry of

Public Order and Christian Affairs to forward its recommendations regarding the said

appeals to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration. Thus, the mandate

if any, the letter R 2 had granted to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and

Christian Affairs is only to forward its recommendations relating to appeals pertaining

to its officers. The mandate if any, the letter R 2 had granted to the said

Siyambalapitiya Committee is only to assist the Secretary of the Ministry of Public

Order and Christian Affairs in preparing the requested recommendations to be

submitted to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration. Indeed, the letter

R 2 had not only mandated the said Siyambalapitiya Committee but mandated any

other members of its staff also to render assistance required for preparation of the

requested recommendations.

The Secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and Christian Affairs, by the letter dated

12-01-2016 produced marked R 5, had forwarded the recommendations of the

Siyambalapitiya Committee to the secretary Ministry of Public Administration as

requested by the letter dated 23-06-2015 (R 2). It is to be noted that the said letter

R 5 has merely forwarded the report of the Siyambalapitiya Committee rather than

the recommendations of the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and Christian

Affairs. The Petitioners have also produced the aforesaid letter dated 12-01-2016

marked P 6.

It then came to light that the official committee appointed by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Public Administration as per the decision by the Cabinet of Ministers (P 2)

and the Siyambalapitiya Committee appointed by the Minister of Public Order and

Christian Affairs, had made conflicting recommendations in respect of some officers.

It was in this backdrop that the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development,

by the Cabinet memorandum dated 06-04-2016, sought Cabinet approval to appoint

a new three member committee comprising of an Additional Secretary of the Ministry

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 26 of 32

of Public administration, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Law and Order and

Southern Development and a Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police to reconsider

and make recommendations on the appeals of police officers who were subjected to

political victimization. Hon. Attorney General has produced the said Cabinet

memorandum dated 06-04-2016 marked R 6. The document produced by the

Petitioners marked P 7 appears to be a copy of R 6.

Pursuant to the said Cabinet memorandum (R 6) the Cabinet of Ministers decided on

19-04-2016 to approve the said proposal to appoint a three-member committee by

the Minister of Law and Order and Sothern Development and to forward the

recommendations of the said committee to the Cabinet. Hon. Attorney General has

produced the said Cabinet decision on 19-04-2016 marked R 7.

It was pursuant to the said Cabinet decision (R 7) that a committee comprising of Ms.

B. M. M. M. Basnayake (Additional Secretary Ministry of Public Administration), Neil

Hapuhinna (Additional Secretary Ministry of Law and Order) and Ravi

Wijegunawardene (Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police) were appointed to

reconsider and make recommendations regarding the afore-stated appeals. This

Committee (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Basnayake Committee)

recommended granting relief to 129 police officers. Hon. Attorney General by way of

Motion dated 2nd February 2018 has produced the Basnayake Committee report

marked Y.

Thereafter, the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, by the Cabinet

Memorandum dated 10th June 2016, sought the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers,

for the implementation of the recommendations of the Basnayake Committee. Hon.

Attorney General has produced the said Cabinet Memorandum dated 10th June 2016

marked R 8.

The Cabinet of Ministers, having considered the above Memorandum (R 8), the

observations in that regard forwarded by the Minister of Finance dated 18th June 2016

(R 9), the observations dated 23rd June 2015 forwarded by the Minister of Public

Administration and Management (R 10), decided on 28th June 2016, to request the

Prime Minister to propose a methodology to grant relief to officers who had been

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 27 of 32

subjected to disciplinary measures. Hon. Attorney General has produced the said

Cabinet decision on 28th June 2016, marked R 11.

Upon the above request, the Prime Minister had proposed that those who were not

facing any pending disciplinary proceedings, be granted relief without delay. The

Prime Minister had also proposed that those who were facing disciplinary proceedings

be granted relief if they are exonerated. The Note to the Cabinet dated 26th of July

2016 containing the said proposal by the Prime Minister has been produced by Hon.

Attorney General, marked R 12.

The President has approved the said proposal made by the Prime Minister subject to

the condition that the relief could be granted only if such a course of action would not

affect the seniority of other serving police officers. Hon. Attorney General has

produced the said observations of the President dated 29th July 2016 marked R 14.

The Cabinet of Ministers having considered the Note to the Cabinet forwarded by the

Prime Minster (R 12) along with the observations of the President (R 14) and the

observations of the Minister of Finance ( R 9), decided on 9th August 2016 to direct

the Secretary Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development to implement the

proposals recommended in the Note to the Cabinet (R 12) forwarded by the Prime

Minister subject to the conditions set out in the observations of the President (R 14).

The Cabinet of Ministers also decided to treat the above decision as a matter of Policy.

Hon. Attorney General has produced the copy of the said Cabinet decision dated 9th

August 2016 marked (R15). For clarity I would reproduce below the relevant extract

from the said Cabinet decision R15.

Given below is an extract of Item (08) of the Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting held on

2016-08-09.

Item (08)

Cabinet Paper No. 16/1473/702/053, a Note to the Cabinet dated 2016-07-26 by the

Prime Minister on Providing relief to those who faced difficulties due to

political reasons- (Cabinet decision dated 2016-04-19 on CP No. 16/0654/748/010

and 2016-06-28 on CP No. 16/1134/748/010-I refers) the above Note was considered

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 28 of 32

along with the observations of H.E the President and the Minister of Finance. After

discussion, it was decided-

a) To grant approval treating this as matter of policy, to the proposals (I) and (II)

in paragraph 03 of the Note;

b) To direct the Secretary, Ministry of Law & Order and Southern Development-

(i) to take note of the matters highlighted in the observations of H.E the

President and pursue action accordingly, and

(ii) to obtain the concurrence/approval of the relevant authorities prior to

implementation of the proposals referred to at (a) above, as indicated in

the observations of the Minister of Finance.

It was also decided to treat this decision as confirmed and to authorize the Secretary

action accordingly.

Action by: Secretary to the Prime Minister - above observations annexed.

My/Law & Order and Southern Development - copy of Note and

above observations annexed.

Copied to: Secretary to the President - observations of the Minister of Finance

annexed.

My/Finance - observations of H.E the President annexed.

My/Public Administration and Management - copy of Note and

above observations annexed.

Secretary, National Police Commission - copy of Note and above

observations annexed.

Let me at this stage turn to the complaint made by the Petitioners. The Petitioners in

their petition have stated that the Siyambalapitiya Committee appointed by the

Minister of Public Order and Christian Affairs, having interviewed 812 police personnel

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 29 of 32

(who had submitted appeals) and having considered their appeals, recommended

relief to 333 officers on the grounds of political victimization.

The Petitioners have stated that the Siyambalapitiya Committee in its report has

recommended that the Petitioners be given various relief and that the said relief are

set out in the circular dated 18.03.2016 which was issued for the purpose of

implementing the said recommendations. The Petitioners have not produced the said

circular but produced the circular P 5 which is applicable to the Education Service.

The Petitioners complain that the subsequently appointed Basnayake Committee

conducted fresh interviews in respect of only the 333 officers recommended by the

Siyambalapitiya Committee and another 100 officers recommended by some other ad

hoc committee and failed to reconsider appeals of remaining police officers from the

list of 812 appellants from the Police Department. The Petitioners also complain that

the Basnayake Committee selected only 92 people from the previously selected list of

333 leaving out 241 people out of the said list including the 11th to 44th Petitioners.

The Petitioners further complain that the Basnayake Committee has also considered

and included the names of 9 officers, who are 61st to the 69th Respondent who were

not amongst the appellants considered by the Siyambalapitiya Committee or any other

ad hoc committee. The Petitioners complain that the action of Basnayake Committee

recommending a total number of 129 Police Officers for redress, is arbitrary, unfair

and/or unreasonable and/or devoid of any rational basis and hence violates their

fundamental rights.

Further, the Petitioners state that the Basnayake committee has given lesser relief for

the 1st to 10th Petitioners than the relief recommended by Siyambalapitiya Committee.

The Petitioners also state that Basnayake Committee has arbitrarily dropped the

recommendations of the Siyambalapitiya Committee in respect of 11th to 44th

Petitioners who were waiting to receive the said recommended relief.

The Petitioners allege that the above action by subsequently appointed Basnayake

Committee is ultra vires, arbitrary and has violated the fundamental rights of the

petitioners. The Petitioners therefore seek to challenge the said Basnayake Committee

recommendations in this application.

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 30 of 32

It is in that backdrop that the Petitioners in this application have prayed inter alia, for

the following relief in their petition.

(i) Declare that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution has been violated by the 2nd to 4th

Respondents and/or 14th to 59th Respondents

(ii) Declare that the recommendations of the Basnayake Committee to grant

relief to the 129 persons without granting the reliefs recommended to the

Petitioners by the Siyambalapitiya Committee is unlawful and/or wrong in

law and is violative of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and/or the implementation thereof by the

14th to 59th Respondents is violative of the Petitioners fundamental rights

(iii) Declare that the Petitioners are entitled to be granted the reliefs

recommended by the Siyambalapitiya Committee marked as P 4 after

addressing the anomalies contained therein

(iv) Direct that the Petitioners be granted the reliefs recommended by the

Siyambalapitiya Committee marked P4 after addressing the anomalies

contained therein

(v) Grant compensation in an amount of Rs. 750,000/- to the Petitioners

In the instant case, the Court has granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Thus, the task of this Court at this moment must be to ascertain whether

anyone or more of the Respondents have infringed the fundamental rights of the

petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

By looking at the prayers of the petition, it is clear that it is the recommendations

made by the Siyambalapitiya Committee that the Petitioners seek to enforce in this

application. As has been mentioned above, Siyambalapitiya Committee is not a

committee that has been appointed in consequence or under any authority of any

Cabinet decision. The decision of the Cabinet of Ministers marked P 2 has only

authorized the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration to appoint an official

committee to examine the said appeals and make recommendations. Thus, the

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 31 of 32

appointment, the proceedings and the decision of the Siyambalapitiya Committee does

not have any lawful basis.

The letter dated 23-06-2015 (R 2) had only asked the Secretary of the Ministry of

Public Order and Christian Affairs to forward its recommendations regarding the

relevant appeals to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration. Thus, the

mandate if any, the letter R 2 had granted to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public

Order and Christian Affairs by the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration was only

to forward its recommendations (relating to appeals pertaining to the officers coming

under the Ministry of Public Order and Christian Affairs) to the Secretary of the Ministry

of Public Administration. This clearly shows that the recommendations made by

Siyambalapitiya Committee is not final but would be open for review.

It would be opportune at this juncture to consider the position taken up by the learned

counsel for the 71st respondent.

One of the three members of the Siyambalapitiya Committee is Ananda Ratnaweera

(Former Superintended of Police). It has come to light in the course of these

proceedings that the recommendations made by Siyambalapitiya Committee (P 4)

contains a recommendation favorable to that member Ananda Ratnaweera. This is

found under item No. 191 of the said report. Thus, it is clear that the Siyambalapitiya

Committee which comprised of three members has not had any hesitation or restrain

to proceed to make a recommendation favorable to one of its members also. This in

my view violates the breach of rules of natural justice namely the rule Nemo judex in

causa sua which is sufficient to vitiate the proceedings and the recommendations

made by Siyambalapitiya Committee as appearing in P 4.

Bamunu Mudiyanselage Kandewalawwe Kingsley Ekanayake who is the 71st

Respondent in this application has also filed an affidavit stating that the document P

4 which the Petitioners seek to enforce in this proceeding is not the genuine

recommendations made by the Siyambalapitiya Committee of which he was one of

the three members. Moreover, the learned counsel for the 71st respondent Mr. Widura

Ranawaka, having highlighted many discrepancies between P 4 and genuine copy

also revealed before this Court that P 4 contains interpolations made by the General

Secretary of the United National Party Cabir Hashim who had placed his seal on P 4.

(SC FR 336/2016) - Page 32 of 32

This is indicative of the fact that a particular political party had been involved in the

decision-making process at least as far as the said document (P 4) (as has been

produced to this Court) is concerned. In the afore-stated circumstances, this court is

unable to accept and enforce the recommendations contained in the said document

(P 4) as a legal document.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, The Petitioners are not entitled

to succeed with the prayers in this application. This Court decides to dismiss this

application but without costs.
