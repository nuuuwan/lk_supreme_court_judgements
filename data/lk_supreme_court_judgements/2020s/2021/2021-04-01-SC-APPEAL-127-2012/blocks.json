Thus, the Defendant in his amended answer had claimed title to land in schedule 2 to the plaint on the strength of P7, a deed of transfer executed by said Rajapoobathy Samuel.

The other issues raised by the Plaintiffs concentrate on to query whether the Defendant\u2019s predecessors in title had title to transfer their rights as well as whether the Defendant is in unlawful possession disputing plaintiffs\u2019 rights and also to query whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the reliefs prayed for.",

Thus, the validity of the Deed of Gift given to Rajendran, marked P1, till it was purportedly cancelled by Marimuttu, was never at issue at the trial. As held in Hanaffi Vs Nallamma (1998) 1 Sri L R 73, once issues are framed, the case which the court has to hear and determine is crystallized in the issues, and the pleadings recede to the background. Hence, whether the gift given by P1 was accepted or not was not a matter in issue in the District Court for the parties to adduce evidence in that regard. (Also see",

Nevertheless, in appeal, learned High Court judges have correctly held that Kandyan Law is not a territorial law that applies to all the people resident in the Kandyan Province but a law personal to Kandyan Sinhalese and, admittedly Marimuttu being a Tamil, he was not governed by the Kandyan law, and as such, the learned District Judge erred in considering P1 as a Kandyan Gift that could be cancelled by the Donor himself. This part of the learned High Court Judges\u2019 judgment is not in dispute before this court. Even the Defendant admits the finding on non-applicability of Kandyan Law is correct - vide paragraph 26(i) of the Petition as well as at page 5 of his written submissions dated 06.06.2019. However, the learned High Court Judges came to the finding that there was a tacit acceptance of deed of gift marked P1 and, hence, allowing the appeal, held in favour of the Plaintiffs as mentioned above. When the leave to appeal application was supported by the aggrieved Defendant, on 17.07 2012 this court has granted leave on two questions of law which will be referred to later in this judgment.",

    "text": "As per Public Trustee V Uduruwana 51 N L R 193, a donation is a bilateral agreement to which there must be two consenting parties1; one person is called the \u201cdonor\u201d who without being under any legal obligation so to do and without receiving or stipulating for anything in return gives or promises to give something to another, who is called the \u201cdonee\u201d2. In Abubucker Vs Fernando (1987) 2 Sri. L. R 225, referring to page 285 of the 5th edition of Roman Dutch Law by Lee, it was held that under the Roman Dutch Law, a donation is regarded as a contract and no obligation arises until the acceptance by the donee and, a donation to be valid has to be perfected by acceptance. Further with reference to Hendrick V Sudritaratne (1912) 3 CAC 80, it was further mentioned that no particular form is required for the acceptance of the gift and that it is in every case a question of fact whether or not there are sufficient indications of the acceptance by the donee. In Nagalingam V Thanabalasingham 50 N L R 97 at 98 Canekeratne J., pointed out that a donor makes a gift with the intention that the thing would become the property of the donee; the offer must be accepted by him to whom it is made, for the concurrence of the donor and donee must take place in order to render the donation perfect, the obligatory effect of the gift depends upon its acceptance. More than a century ago, a full bench decision of D.C. Matara 20,862(1871), Vand.168 also had stated that a deed of gift have no force until it is accepted. Even though, it was held in Siriwardene V Wirawanthan (2001) 2Sri L R 288 and in Nonai V Appuhamy 21 N L R 165 that the effect of non-acceptance of a gift by the donee is to entitle the donor to revoke the gift and make any disposition of any kind, it appears from the decisions mentioned above that if the donation is not accepted the gift made is void indicating that executing a deed of revocation is not a must. Referring to Fernando V Alwis 37 N L R 201 the Defendant in his written submissions dated 06.06 2019 argues that the effect of non-acceptance is that it renders the gift invalid and not merely voidable. Furthermore, citing Bertie Fernando and Others V Missie Fernando and Others (1986) 1 S L R 211 in the said written submissions, the Defendant contends that non-acceptance vitiates a deed and there need not be any revocation even though there is a practice evolved to execute deed of revocation. Considering the ratio of aforementioned judgments this court is not hesitant to accept that a donation given by a deed is not valid, if the donation is not accepted by the donee, and a deed of revocation is not mandatory. This position can be further cemented since the right to challenge the validity of a gift for want of acceptance is not restricted to the donor- vide Kanapathipillai V",

    "text": "the Plaintiffs. The Defendant\u2019s stance was that he was the tenant of the premises prior to the execution of the deed marked P7-(vide paragraph 11 of the amended answer and evidence given at page 109 of the brief). Since validity of P1 prior to the deed of revocation marked P4 was not in issue as well as the said revocation cannot be considered as a valid revocation, no title can be passed from Marimuttu to the Defendant through P7. None of the purported predecessors in title of the Defendant has given evidence to say that their possession was adverse to the that of Plaintiffs, if they had any possession. As such, the Defendant cannot claim the benefit of possession (if any) of his purported predecessors in title to his benefit. Furthermore, the Defendant\u2019s claim that he was a tenant until the execution of P7 refers to a tenancy under Marimuttu and Marimuttu\u2019s heirs which include Rajendran. Both of them being the predecessors in title of the Plaintiffs, Defendant\u2019s possession up to the refusal to pay rent to the Plaintiffs cannot be considered as adverse to the Plaintiffs\u2019 title since there was no evidence of an overt act up to such refusal. It appears that the refusal to pay rent happened only after P3 which is dated 11.09.1985. The Plaint dated 23.10.1989 was filed within 10 years from such refusal. Not that this court accepts the version of the Defendant but, for the sake of argument, if one considers Defendant\u2019s stance, according to it, the Plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title, Rajendran did not get title from P1 but he became a co-owner along with his siblings after the death of Marimuttu. By that time, he had sold it to the Plaintiffs. Exceptio Rei Venditae et traditae principle applies and accordingly, Rajendran\u2019s share should go to the Plaintiffs. It should be noted that priority of registration was not put in issue in relation to any conflicting deeds. Thus, the Defendant cannot get the share that Rajendran gets as per his story through P5 and P7. Thus, even for the sake of argument, if one considers the Defendant\u2019s story, the Plaintiffs should have become co-owners and the Defendant cannot get prescriptive title without proving an overt act and 10 years possession from thereon. As such, the Defendant\u2019s claim on prescription cannot be sustained.",

There may be other circumstances involved in those cases which supported the acceptance of the gift but, nonetheless, it appears from Joraliyathu Umma Vs Mohomed, a subsequent deed of gift by the donee was considered as a subsequent conduct of the donee that established the acceptance. In Wickremesinghe Vs Wijetunga, a sale of the land by the donee was expressly considered as a subsequent conduct that established the acceptance of the gift made to the donee. It appears that such expression was made by focusing on the act of sale by the donee and not on other grounds. On the other hand, one cannot gift or sell unless he considers himself as the owner. A donee can consider himself/herself as the owner only after he or she has accepted the gift. Thus, there is nothing wrong in considering the subsequent gift or sale of the land by the donee as an indication of accepting the gift made to him. Further, there were other grounds in the case at hand also. Rajendran, donee of P1 had written P3 asking the Defendant to pay rent to the Plaintiffs. No communication was marked to show that the Defendant refuted in reply that Rajendran, the predecessor of title of the Plaintiff was not the landlord. P3 also indicate that Rajendran considered himself as the owner that in turn can be considered supportive of the position that there was an acceptance of the deed of gift P1.",

It appears that the learned High Court Judges considered that P2 was executed prior to the aforesaid purported deed of revocation by Marimuttu without sufficient evidence to that effect, but it does not matter, as explained before, Marimuttu has no power under the law to cancel a deed on her own. As such it has to be considered as a mere declaration made by her in that regard but not a valid revocation since there is no court decree revoking the deed of gift. Since there is no issue on acceptance of the gift made by P1, it cannot be considered as a declaration with any force. In Kannapathipillai V Kannachi 13 N L R 166 a deed of revocation by the donor was considered as waste paper since there was no cancellation by a court and the gift remained in force. Before the purported conflicting deeds executed by the heirs of the donor, Marimuttu, the donee of P1, namely Rajendran, during the lifetime of Marimuttu, has expressed his acceptance of P1 by conduct, by selling the land to",
