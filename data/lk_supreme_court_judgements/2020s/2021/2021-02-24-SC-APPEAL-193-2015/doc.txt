Judgement

Aluwihare PC J.,

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

‘Plaintiff’) instituted action in the Commercial High Court of Colombo against the 1st

and the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the ‘1st and 2nd Defendants respectively’) on the premise that they failed to honour the

terms and conditions of a Guarantee Bond signed by the 1st and the 2nd Defendants,

securing the re-payment of the monies lent to the Principal Debtor by the Respondent

Bank.

The Sequence of Events

Court issued summons on the 1st and 2nd Defendants and the summons had been

served on the 1st Defendant. On 5th May 2010, when the matter was called before the

court, an Attorney-at-Law had appeared on behalf of the 1st Defendant and moved

for time to file the Proxy and the Answer.

Accordingly, the matter was fixed for the 17th June 2010, for the filing of the 1st

Defendant’s Proxy and Answer. When the matter was called on 17th June 2010, both

the Plaintiff and the Defendants had been absent, as such there had been no order

made by the Court. The journal entry states “Plaintiff is not present. Defendants are

not present. No order.”

More than three years later, on 7th November 2013 the Plaintiff moved the Court to

re-issue summons against the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The Fiscal had reported that he

was unable to serve summons, since the 1st Defendant’s house was closed. Thereafter,

on 4th July 2014 the Plaintiff moved Court to have summons served on the 1st

Defendant by way of substituted service, which was allowed.

When this matter came up before the Court on 28th October 2014, a Proxy had been

filed on behalf of the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant however, did not proceed to

5

file an answer, but moved court to apply the provisions embodied in Section 402 of

the CPC and sought the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s case. The Plaintiff filed objections

[19th March 2015] against the said application of the 1st Defendant and the matter

was fixed for inquiry on 23rd June 2015. The inquiry into the Section 402 application

was concluded based on the written submissions filed by the respective parties and

the Order was pronounced on 4th September 2015.

The Order of the High Court

The Court by the said order held that Section 402 of the CPC ought not to be applied

in the given situation. The learned Trial Judge [predecessor of the learned High court

judge whose order is impugned in these proceedings] observed that, although none

of the parties was present when the matter came up before Court on the 17th June

2010 and the record was journalized as “no order”, by motion dated 07th November

2013, the Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff, nevertheless, had got the case called on

the 13th November 2013 [Journal entry No. 6]. The learned High Court Judge had also

observed that, according to the journal entry No. 6, the Plaintiff had obtained an order

to have summons re-issued on the 1st Defendant and had taken steps to have summons

served on the 1st Defendant.

The learned High Court Judge having formed the view, that his predecessor, by

making an order to have the summons re-issued, had thought it fit to entertain the

application of the Plaintiff, it would not be appropriate at that juncture for him to

exercise the discretion vested with the Court in terms of Section 402 of the CPC in

favour of the 1st Defendant and rejected the application of the 1st Defendant.

Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the 1st Defendant is now canvassing the legality of

the same before this court.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal and the question that was raised before us was;

“whether the impugned order is contrary to Section 402 of the CPC in that the learned

High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the material facts in the correct

6

perspective, thus misdirecting himself in law.’ [paragraph 2 of the petition of the 1st

Defendant]

It was argued on behalf of the 1st Defendant that, since the Plaintiff had failed to take

any steps to prosecute the action for a period exceeding three years, the Court ought

to have made an order to abate the action in terms of Section 402 of the CPC.

The Learned Counsel for the 1st Defendant-Appellant argued that the Plaintiff

defaulted, by not being present in court on 17th June 2010 and did not take any step

to prosecute the case until 7th November 2013 thus, satisfying all the conditions for

an order of abatement of the action, in terms of Section 402 of the CPC.

If I may refer to the sequence of events, as per the relevant journal entries they are as

follows.

On 17th June 2010:

Neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendant was present, and it was journalized as

“No order”.

On 7th November 2013:

Plaintiff filed a motion and moved to have summons re-issued on the

Defendants and to have the matter called on 17th January 2014 as the summons

returnable date.

On 13th November 2013:

The Court having considered the motion [dated 7th November 2013] ordered

to have summons re-issued on the Defendants returnable on 17th January

2014.

Although there appears to be a lack of diligence on the part of the Plaintiff to take

necessary steps with regard to the case, the Plaintiff also had faced numerous

difficulties in having summons served on the Defendants. The 1st Defendant-

Appellant appeared before Court on 3rd September 2014 only after summons were

served through substituted service.

Section 402 of the CPC reads as follows;

“If a period exceeding twelve months in the case of a District Court or Family Court,

or six months in a Primary Court, elapses subsequently to the date of the last entry of

an order or proceeding in the record without the plaintiff taking any steps to

prosecute the action where any such step is necessary, the court may pass an order

that the action shall abate.” [emphasis is mine]

What is significant is that, in terms of Section 402 of the CPC, making an order ‘that

the action shall abate’, is discretionary as indicated by the choice of the word ‘may’;

“the court may pass an order”. Thus, even in instances where twelve months had

lapsed, subsequent to the date of the last entry of an order or proceeding, without the

Plaintiff taking any step to prosecute action, there is no compulsion on the court to

pass an order to abate the action.

Although the statutory provision does not so stipulate, the jurisprudence developed

over the years now requires the court to make an order abating the action, only after

due notice to the Plaintiff. The court should never exercise the power (under section

402) ex mero motu (vide Fernando v. Peris 3 NLR 77). In the case of Supramaniam et

al v. Symons 18 NLR 229 [at page 231] Wood Renton CJ observed “It is now, I believe

the practice in many of the District Courts for the Judge himself to take the initiative

and pass orders of abatement under Section 402 after having given due public notice

of his intention to do so.” [emphasis added]

The Learned High Court Judge necessarily would have been alive to the fact that more

than three years had lapsed since the last entry, when he was called upon to consider

the motion of the Plaintiff, moving to have summons reissued. Thus, when he (upon

consideration of the motion) permitted the application of the Plaintiff and allowed

summons be re-issued, it has to be construed that such permission was given after

addressing his judicial mind to the application of the Plaintiff. Thus, it is clear that the

Learned High Court Judge, even when he could have exercised his discretion against

the Plaintiff under Section 402 and caused the action to abate, decided otherwise. The

fact that he did not take steps to inform the Plaintiff (as now required by law) about

8

any intention to abate the action and that he decided to make an order to reissue

summons, is clearly demonstrative of that decision. In my view, the exercise of the

discretion by the learned High Court Judge in favour of the Plaintiff is neither

unreasonable nor arbitrary, considering the facts and circumstances of this case.

The Learned Counsel for the 1st Defendant-Appellant drew the attention of court to

the case of Buffin v. Anthony Neville and Another SC Appeal 63/16 SC Minutes 14.

06. 2018. The circumstances of the case of Buffin (supra) can be clearly distinguished

from the case before us. The facts were these. In October 1994 the case was laid by

for the reason that the Plaintiff had not taken any steps. In December of the same year

(1994) the Plaintiff moved to have the proxy revoked and the court permitted the

same. In 2009, almost 16 years later, by way of a motion the Plaintiff, filing a fresh

proxy, moved to proceed against two of the Defendants.

When this motion came up for consideration, the court gave its mind to whether

Section 402 of the CPC should be applied in view of the fact that the Plaintiff had been

dormant for sixteen years and ordered summons on the Defendants affording them

also an opportunity to place their position with regard to abating the action of the

Plaintiff in terms of Section 402 of the CPC.

Thus it is seen [in the case of Buffin], that there had been an uninterrupted gap of

sixteen years between the date on which the Plaintiff got the proxy revoked

(December 1994) and the date on which the court took into consideration the

Plaintiff’s application to proceed against some of the Defendants in 2009.

Furthermore, the court did not consider the application of the Plaintiff nor did the

court make “any entry” relating to the application of the Plaintiff, moving to accept

the new proxy. The court, however, gave its mind as to whether that was a fit instance

to make an order of abatement in terms of Section 402 of the CPC.

The questions of law that were raised in the case of Buffin [supra] was quite different

to the question of law raised in the present case. The main question that was raised in

the case of Buffin [supra] was whether the motion [fresh proxy] filed by the Plaintiff

in that case in 2009 which was journalized as journal entry No.6 should be

9

considered as the‘last entry’ from which the period of 12 months should be counted

for the purposes of Section 402 of the CPC.

This was rightly rejected by the Supreme Court for the reason that, the journal entry

No.6 referred to above remained merely as an administrative or clerical act which

was not visited with a ‘judicial mind’. [see the case of Kumarihamy v. Keerthirathne

12 Times Law Report pg. 80]

As opposed to that, in the present case the court had considered the application of the

Plaintiff on the13th November 2013 and made an order [an entry] allowing the

application of the Plaintiff without proceeding to act under Section 402 of the CPC.

Thus, it is clear that the Plaintiff had taken “a step” in 2013, to prosecute the action

and by the order dated 13th November 2013, the court had permitted it.

When the Defendant made the application to abate the action of the Plaintiff on the

28th of October 2014, in terms of Section 402 of the CPC, the learned High Court

Judge was required consider;

(1) Whether there was an entry of an order or proceeding in the record in the

12-month period, immediately preceding 28th October 2014.

And if so,

(2) Whether such entry relates to any step taken by the Plaintiff to prosecute

the action.

Having given his mind to the conditions referred to above, the learned High Court

Judge correctly held that although three years have elapsed between 7th November

2010 and 28th October 2014, by allowing the Plaintiff’s application on 13th November

2013, his predecessor had permitted the Plaintiff to take a step to prosecute the action.

Therefore, the relevant date for computing the period of 12 months referred to in

Section 402 of the CPC is 13th November 2013. Hence, when the learned High court

judge was called upon to apply section 402 of the CPC, the Plaintiff had, within a

period of 12 months, taken a step rendered necessary by a positive requirement of the

law.

10

In the case of Samsudeen v. Eagle Star Insurance Co LTD. 64 NLR 372, Justice

Tambiah, after considering a long line of cases held that; “Both on principle and on

authority it seems to us that unless the plaintiff has failed to take a step rendered

necessary by the law to prosecute his action, an order of abatement should not be

made under section 402 of the Civil Procedure Code”.

Considering the above I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge had not

erred in overruling the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the 1st Defendants

and I answer the question of law in the negative.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the Respondents would be entitled to the

costs of this application.

Appeal dismissed.
