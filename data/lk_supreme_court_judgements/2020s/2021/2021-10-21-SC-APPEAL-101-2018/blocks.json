It must be noted that none of these documents were impeached through issues and only P2, P2A and P6 and P6A were marked subject to proof when they were tendered in evidence for the first time. P2 is the plan made by J R A Rodrigo, licensed surveyor and P2 A appears to be the field notes relevant to the said plan P2. P6 and P6A are the plan No.1778 and its report made by T D K R P Pathegama, Licensed Surveyor. T D K R P Pathegama, Licensed Surveyor has given evidence to prove the plan and the report he made. Since J R A Rodrigo, Licensed Surveyor is dead, it appears one Ajith Prassanna Silva, Licensed Surveyor, who has previously used plans made by said J R A Rodrigo and who has seen the signature of said J R A Rodrigo, has been summoned to prove the said plan marked P2. Furthermore, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the Defendant has not reiterated the objections made to those documents. Thus, when the decision of Sri Lanka Ports Authority V Jugolinija Bold East (1981) 1 Sri L R 18 is considered together with section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code, all the documents marked by the plaintiff as P1 to P8 can be considered as evidence for all the purposes of the case filed before the District Judge. By tendering deed no. 11483 marked as P1, the Plaintiff has established how he became entitled to the land described in the second schedule to the plaint which is Lot A of the said plan marked P2 as stated in paragraph 4 of the amended plaint. As per the portion marked as P1A in the schedule of the said deed, the transferor of the said deed had acquired title through the deed No. 4373 dated 14.02.1947 attested by W.P. Senaviratne, Notary Public which supports the averments in the paragraph 3 of the amended plaint. Through P1 plaintiff has also acquired the right of way over the land described in the 3rd schedule to the plaint which is Lot B of the said Plan",

Thus, it is clear that the Defendant is now using the encroached portion shown as lot 1 in Plan marked P6 which is part of the land in schedule no 5 of the amended plaint as part attached to his roadway. Nevertheless, to prove prescriptive rights to this encroached portion or lot 1 in P6, the Defendant must show 10 years or more adverse possession or adverse user of this encroached portion as a right of way. The first witness called by the Defendant, one Premasiri Fernando has given evidence to prove the photographs (V1 to V3) and he has not given any evidence with regard to the user or possession of the encroached portion which is lot 1 of P6. Other than the said witness, only the Defendant and a Notary Public have given evidence in support of the version of the Defendant. Said notary public has given evidence with regard to the execution of deed No 2466 marked V4 and he was not a witness to establish the fact that the Defendant had adverse possession or user of the encroached portion which is lot 1 in P6 as part of a road access for more than 10 years. The Defendant in his evidence in chief has stated that he bought his land by aforesaid V4 and it was bought along with the right of way mentioned in that deed, and further that the said right of way is the matter in dispute. He has further testified that his predecessors in title said to him that the said right of way has been used by his predecessors in title for more than 15 years and even that the Plaintiff had admitted in evidence that the said road in V1 (though V1 has been referred to as a plan, in fact V1 is one of the photos tendered by the Defendant) was used for more than 60 years. However, it must be noted that the Plaintiff does not dispute the right of way given by deed marked V 4 which is lot B in P2 containing 3.20 perches. What is in dispute is part of the land described in the 5th schedule to the amended plaint which is shown as lot 1 in P6 and said lot 1 is found adjacent to aforesaid right of way, namely lot B of P2, on its west boundary as per the plan marked P6. The deed marked V4 has not given any soil right or right of way to this portion of land found outside along the west boundary of the said Lot B. Even if one assumes for the sake of argument that predecessors in title of the defendant acquired prescriptive rights to the said lot 1 in P6 or had commenced adverse possession or user of Lot 1 in P6, that area of land has not been conveyed to the Defendant by the said deed.

    "text": "the area that falls within Lot 1 of P6 as established by the evidence of T. D. K. R. P. Pathegama. Therefore, the Defendant cannot get the benefit of the possession or adverse user of his predecessors in title, if there was any such possession or user by them with regard to lot 1 of P6, which is situated outside the boundaries of Lot B of P2. On the other hand, no predecessor in title to the Defendant was summoned to give evidence to state that they had prescriptive rights, or had adverse possession or user of the Lot 1 in P6 and conveyed those rights to the Defendant. The deeds marked as P9 and P10 during the cross examination shows that even the predecessors in title of the Defendant had their right of way only over Lot B of P2 which Lot B does not include Lot 1 of P6. It can be observed that in V4 which was executed in 2008, east boundary of lot C in P2 which is Lot B of P2 has been described as a 10 feet wide road but when it described the right of way which is Lot B in P2 in its second schedule has not indicated it is a 10 feet wide road way but the extent has been given as 3.2 perches. However, in P9 which was executed in 2007 by the Defendant\u2019s predecessors in title, the east boundary of lot C has not been described as a 10 feet wide roadway. Even in P10 which was executed in 1968, east boundary of lot C has not been described as a 10 feet wide road. Both these P9 and P10 deeds described Lot B in their second schedule as a right of way of 3.2 perches but not as a 10 feet wide roadway. Mr. Pathegama, Licensed Surveyor through his plan and report marked as P6 and P6A and his oral evidence has established that in fact Lot B in P2 is a right of way of 3.2 perches with a width of eight and half feet and with the encroachment of the portion shown as lot 1 in his plan marked p6, it has become 10 feet wide. Since this right of way has not been described as a10 feet roadway in marked deeds written up to 2007 and such description is only found in the deed V4 which was written in 2008 in describing the east boundary of Lot C in P2, it is more probable that the encroachment could have taken place close to the date of V4. However, the Defendant has not led any evidence of a predecessor in title to show that one of them encroached lot 1 in P6 or had adverse possession or user of that portion.",
