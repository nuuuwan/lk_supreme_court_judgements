The Facts

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent namely Kuruwita Arachchillage Jagath

Kumara Abeythunga (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) instituted Partition

action before the District Court of Avissawella by Plaint dated 30th August 2006 against

the Defendants; Kuruwita Arachillage Jayathilaka (1st Defendant-Appellant-Appellant,

hereinafter referred to as the 1st Appellant) and Agas Pathirennehelage Gunaratna

(2nd Defendant-Appellant-Appellant, hereinafter referred to as 2nd Appellant).

The original owner of the land sought to be partitioned was one Kuruwita

Arachchillage Peter Appuhamy who became entitled by virtue of final decree in

Partition Action bearing No.7160 in the District Court of Avissawella and thereafter

transferred his rights to one Kuruwita Arachchillage Hemaratne by Deed of Transfer

No.36180 dated 11th November 1968.

The said Hemaratne died intestate leaving behind 1/2 share to his wife

Danasuriya Arachchige Baby Nona and the remainder 1/2 share to his six siblings

namely Kuruwita Arachillage Kusumawathie, Jayathilaka (1st Appellant), Kamalawathie,

Gnanalatha (referred to as Gunathilaka in the District Court Judgement), Thilakalatha

and Abeytunga. The said Baby Nona transferred her rights to the Respondent by the

Deed of Transfer No.1628 dated 1st June 2004. The aforesaid Kusumawathie,

Kamalawathie, Gnanalatha and Thilakalatha transferred their rights to Jayathilaka (1st

Appellant) by Deed of Transfer No. 9925 and thereafter the 1st Appellant transferred

his rights to Agas Pathirennehelage Gunaratna (2nd Appellant).

The Appellants by their joint Statement of Claims dated 29th January 2009,

prayed for dismissal of the action on the grounds that the said Hemaratne was a

person Subject to Kandyan Law and that Baby Nona, wife of said deceased Hemaratne,

was not entitled to any share of the land sought to be Partitioned, as the devolution

of title from him has to be determined in accordance with Kandyan Law where the

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 20

widow is only entitled to Life Interest in the land and that even the said rights were

extinguished upon her remarrying in 1980.

The Respondent pleaded that the rights of said Baby Nona have been

determined in a previous District Court (Avissawella) Case bearing No. 20316/P and

therefore the matter operates as Res Judicata. It must be clarified that the Case no.

20316/P was a Partition Action instituted by the 1st Appellant, regarding a different

land, previously owned by the same Hemaratne. In the case 20316/P, the application

of personal laws was not discussed or contested, and the land was partitioned

considering that Baby Nona (said Hemaratnes widow) was not governed by any

Personal Laws, namely Kandyan Law.

The Respondent argued in the plaint that in the case 20316/P as it was an

undisputed fact that was accepted by all parties, including the 1st Appellant, that Baby

Nona was not subject to Kandyan law, her interest in the land is not merely that of Life

Interest, thus enabling her to transfer her interest in the land to the Respondent by

Deed bearing No. 1628, as was done by her. Thereby he sought the land in the instant

case to be Partitioned accordingly.

The Additional District Judge of Avissawella held in favor of the Respondent by

Judgement dated 28th August 2012.

Being aggrieved and dissatisfied thereof, the Appellants preferred an appeal to

the Provincial High Court of the Western Province (exercising its Civil Appellate

Jurisdiction) holden in Avissawella under and in terms of Section 754(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

The learned High Court Judge, in the judgment dated 30th June 2015, considers

two questions of law. Firstly, the question of whether the said Hemaratne was a

Kandyan and secondly, whether the case bearing 20316/P operates as Res Judicata as

against the parties in this case.

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 20

In answering the first question of law, the learned High Court Judge affirms that

the Appellants have failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that Hemaratne was

a Kandyan and that Kandyan law must apply to the inheritance of his estate.

In answering the second question of law, the Learned Judge noted that the 1st

Appellant of the present case was the 1st Plaintiff in the Partition action bearing No.

20316/P and that the case was concluded without contest. It is manifest from the

Judgment of the 20316/P case that Baby Nona was allotted her share of the land

without any questions being raised as to the law applicable to the estate of Hemaratne.

The Learned Judge notes that as the 1st Appellant was the 1st Plaintiff of the

earlier case, he is bound by the judgment of the said case and is therefore estopped

from claiming that devolution of the title must be determined in accordance with

Kandyan Law. In view of this fact, it was held in the High Court Judgement that the

Additional District Judge was correct in concluding that the judgement in the earlier

partition decree (case bearing No.20316/P), operates as Res Judicata in regard to the

devolution of title from Hemaratne in the present case.

Being aggrieved thereof, the Appellants preferred a Leave to Appeal application

to this court and Leave was granted on the following grounds:

a. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in applying the principles

Res Judicata in the instant matter?

b. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to appreciate that

the land sought to be partitioned in Case No. 20316/P and the land sought

to be partitioned in the instant matter bearing No. 22844/P were not the

same land?

c. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to appreciate and

apply the Judgment in Jayasinghe v. Kiribindu (1997) 2 Sri L.R. 1 and

Gunaratne v. Punchibanda (1927) 29 NLR 249 in determining whether a

person is subject to Kandyan Law or not is a pure question of law?

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 20

d. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to conclude that

the plea of res judicate is not applicable in the instant matter since the

subject matter of the present action has not been concluded in a previous

action within the provisions of Section 34, 207 or 406 of the Civil

Procedure Code?

Application of Kandyan Law instead and the application of Res Judicata

Examining the facts of the instant case, I believe it is prudent to first

acknowledge the central underlying question put forward to this Court by the parties.

It is clear that the Respondent, who has received his interest in the land by widow of

said Hemaratne by Deed of Transfer No. 1628, wishes to Partition this land. It is also

an established fact that the Appellants in the present case maintain that the said

Hemaratne was a Kandyan and thus, the devolution of title from him must be

determined in accordance with Kandyan Law where the widow shall only get an estate

for life.

Section 11 of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance

No.39 of 1938 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance) clearly states that:

(1) When a man shall die intestate after the commencement of this

Ordinance leaving a spouse him surviving, then -

(a) the surviving spouse shall be entitled to an estate for life in the

acquired property of the deceased intestate

(b) if the surviving spouse shall contract a diga marriage, she shall

cease to be entitled to maintenance out of the paraveni property of

the deceased but shall not by reason of such re-marriage forfeit her

aforesaid life estate in the acquired property;

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 20

This provision was applied in the case of Tikiri Banda V. Dingiri Banda (1970)

76 NLR 203, and this principle was followed well before the enactment of the

Ordinance in the case of Dingiri V. Undiya (1918) 20 NLR 186.

It must be noted that there is no mention of a child of said Hemaratne in the

documents before this court. In terms of succession by siblings, which is of significance

to this case, Section 17 of the Ordinance must be referred to, which states as follows:

17. In the devolution of the estate of any person who shall die intestate

after the commencement of this Ordinance,

(a) whenever the estate or any part thereof shall devolve upon heirs

other than a child or the descendant of a child, and such heirs are in

relation to one another brothers or sisters, or brothers and sisters, or

the descendants of any deceased brother or sister, such heirs shall

inherit inter se the like shares and in like manner as they would have

done had they been the children or descendants of the deceased

intestate

Thus, it is clearly advantageous for the Appellants to adopt the stance Kandyan

Law applies due to the above principles. As through the application of the above

principles to the instant case, Baby Nona would not have the power to transfer her

interest to the Respondent and instead of the Appellants and Respondent having a

respective interest of share of the land each, the Respondent would have no interest

in the land at all.

Upon perusal of evidence, we find that in the Examination of witnesses

conducted in the District Court of Avissawella on the 30th of September 2010, in the

present Partition action bearing no.22844/P, the 1st Appellant himself admits the fact

that he wishes different stances to be adopted in the two Partition cases:

: 20316

?

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 20

(Q: Is your problem that in the case 20316, the Court accepted that the

said Hemaratnes Rights transfer to his wife?)

: .

(A: Yes.)

: 22844

?

(Q: Do you not want to say in this 22844 case that Hemaratnes Rights

transfer to his wife?)

: .

(A: No.)

The 1st Appellant further admits that he did not raise the issue regarding the

law applicable to Baby Nona in the District Court case 20316P due to the fact that he

was suffering from poor health conditions and wished for the proceedings to be

concluded quickly and for that land to be partitioned without any contest. However,

in the instant case the 1st Appellant himself persists in requesting the court to apply

Kandyan Law, to the same Baby Nona whose status was not disputed in a case with

similar circumstances to the present case. Based on this observation it is clear that the

Appellants wish for the court to apply different laws to the same person in two separate

but similar cases, with no other basis but their own preference and benefit.

Further, the Appellants point out that Res Judicata cannot be used due to the

difference in subject matter, namely the lands of the two separate cases. However, it

must be noted that while the instant case and the case bearing no.20316P are similar

in the parties and the lineage of the lands, the Judgements by the District Court and

the High Court Judge state that the Courts have used the case 20316P only to the

extent of the law applicable to Baby Nona, and the High Court Judge even notes that

the previous case was about a separate land with parties including but not limited to

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 20

some of the parties of the present case (namely, the 1st Appellant and Respondent).

To this extent it is clear that both the High Court and the District court was concerned

with the consistency of the application of law. This is given that if, in this case Kandyan

Law was to be applied, it would lead to a disparity between the judgement of the

instant case and the judgement in the case bearing no.20316P as different laws would

apply to the same person.

In terms of the substance of the present dispute, it is clear that the parties

disagreement in the use of the principle of Res Judicata pertains to the application or

disapplication of Kandyan Law to the rights of Baby Nona over this property. Thus, I

am of the view that answering the questions of law before this court pertaining to Res

Judicata is not in itself relevant or necessary for the resolution of this dispute, as the

most pressing concern is the potential applicability of Kandyan Law. Thus, prior to

examining the facts, both similar and contrasting, between the instant Partition case

and that bearing no. 20316P, it must be understood that application of the principle

of Res Judicata is of little consequence as the Appellants have failed to prove the

applicability of Kandyan Law to Baby Nona, the deceased Hemaratne, or any parties to

the present dispute.

Applicability of Kandyan Law not proved by the Appellants

It is an established view that where a person contends that a special Personal

Law applies in the place of the General Law, the burden of proof is upon the party

making such a claim. In the case of Kandiah. vs. Saraswathy 54 NLR 137, where the

applicability of Thesavalamai Law to a particular party was discussed, Dias S. P. J stated

as follows:

No authority has been cited to show that there is any presumption of law

by which a Court can say without proof that the Thesavalamai applies to

a particular Tamil who happens to reside in the Jaffna Peninsula. In the

absence of such a presumption I am of opinion that the burden of proof is

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 20

on the party who contends that a special law has displaced the general

law in a given case to prove the applicability of such special law.

(Emphasis added)

I am inclined to follow the precedent set and long followed in terms of the

applicability of the special Personal laws, particularly Kandyan Law, whereby the party

claiming that the special law applies must discharge the burden of proof upon them

to rebut the presumption that General Law is applicable.

In order to determine whether the Appellants have discharged the burden upon

them to prove that the said Hemaratne is indeed a Kandyan, I find it pertinent to firstly

pay attention to the statements of the 1st Appellant himself. Upon perusal of evidence,

we find that in the Examination of witnesses conducted in the District Court of

Avissawella on the 30th of September 2010, in the initial Partition action bearing no.

22844/P for the present case, the 1st Appellant has given the following answers to the

questions asked during cross-examination which I have reproduced below for

reference:

: ?

(Q: Do you have a Kandyan marriage?)

:

(A: This exists as a normal marriage)

Further:

: 112

?

(Q: Didnt your brother Abeythunga also get married under the General

Marriage Registration Ordinance under Chapter 112?)

: .

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 20

(A: Yes.)

:

?

(Q: You said that after the first hearing of the case you were adviced that

you were Kandyan right?)

:

(A: not saying Kandyan, but that Kandyan Law applies)

: , ,

?

(Q: Are you presenting any document that shows that Kandyan Law

applies to you father, mother, or sisters?)

:

(A: I am not presenting such a document)

In examining the above excerpts of the witness statements, it is evident that the

Appellants do not have substantial evidence proving that the law applicable to the

deceased Hemaratne, Baby Nona or even any of the siblings of Hemaratne including

himself is Kandyan Law.

He also states that he is only aware of his lineage to the extent of his Fathers

Father, who he insists was born of persons who were Kandyan from before 1815.

However, the Appellants have not provided this court, The High Court, or the court of

first instance with any substantial evidence to prove that they are subject to Kandyan

law or that any of the relevant persons have even married under Kandyan Law. He is

aware that his own marriage and more importantly, the marriage of the deceased

Hemaratne was under the General Marriages Ordinance

It must also be noted that the Judgement by the District Court Judge and the

High Court Judge clearly state that the only reason for the use of the case 20316P is in

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 20

that the same law must apply to the person, as the Appellants have failed to discharge

the burden of proof upon them.

Therefore, the applicability of Res Judicata is a moot point of discussion as the

objection of the Appellants to the Partitioning of the land as per the plaint of the

Respondent, does not stand when considered upon the merits of this case, the witness

statements of the parties and the submissions before this court, as even if the case

bearing 20316P is not applied Res Judicata, Baby Nona would be Governed by general

law, allowing for the Respondent to have a valid legal claim over of this property

through Deed of Transfer No.1628 as the Appellants have failed to prove the

applicability of Kandyan law.

Application of Res Judicata

The Principle of Res Judicata is founded upon the key maxims of Nemo debet lis

vaxari pro eadem causa (no person should be vexed twice for the same cause), Interest

republicae ut sit finis litium (it is in the interest of the state that there should be an end

of litigation) and Res Judicata pro veritate occipitur (Decision of the court should be

adjudged as true). Through the application of the principle of Res Judicata a party is

barred from re-examining a case which has been adjudicated by a competent court.

In the instant case, the questions of law raised by the parties pertain to Res

Judicata and the application or disapplication of this principle thereof. Thus, I find it

pertinent to establish the facts of the instant case which are of relevance to this

principle.

As mentioned prior, in the District Court case bearing no. 20316P, the current

1st Appellant instituted a partition action for a different land owned by the same

Hemaratne. In the mentioned case, both the 1st Respondent and said Baby Nona are

among the many parties to the action. However, it is pertinent to note that the 2nd

Appellant is not among the parties to said action. Further, it can be averred upon an

examination of the facts that the lands in the case bearing 20316P and the instant case

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 20

are different lands as the names, extent, and the preliminary partition actions which

gave the rights to said Hemaratne are all different.

The Partition action bearing 20316P was concluded with no contest and the

land was partitioned accordingly, with Baby Nona claiming her portion of the land. As

mentioned above, the 1st Appellant himself admits that he did not raise any claim of

the law applicable to Baby Nona as he was unwell and did not wish to delay

proceedings.

However, this Court finds that in the present case, when it is not in the interest

of the 1st Appellant, he raises a claim of the applicability of Kandyan Law to Baby Nona.

If in the unlikely event, this Court, the District Court, or the High Court were to decide

that Kandyan Law does apply to Baby Nona, it would be a judgement conflicting with

the earlier partition case 20316P. It is not prudent to apply two separate personal laws

to the same party in nearly identical circumstances in two separate and similar cases.

Baby Nona is either a person subject to Kandyan Law or she is not. This court cannot

say she is both at the same time due to the failure of the 1st Appellant to raise the

question in the initial case bearing number 20316P.

In arriving at the conclusion that the principle of Res Judicata applies to the

present dispute the District Court and the High Court have taken certain relevant

factors into account. The learned District Court Judge in his judgement for the instant

case, bearing no.22844P has stated in page 3 that in arriving at a decision, he has taken

into consideration the argument by the Respondent that the Judgement in the District

Court case bearing 20316P between the same parties regarding a different land is a

material fact for the instant case in determining whether the deceased Hemaratne is a

Kandyan, the objection by the Appellants refuting that claim, and the judgement of

the case Jayasinghe v Kiribindu and others (1997) 2 SLR 1 relied on by the Defense

to support their objection.

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 20

Upon examining the evidence, the District Court Judge had come to the

conclusion that the Appellants failed to prove that the deceased Hemaratne was a

Kandyan.

In terms of the judgement of the case Jayasinghe v Kiribindu and others

(ibid), the District Court Judge has noted that in this case that while the Supreme

Court had decided that the question of whether a daughter married in Diga can claim

rights of a Binna married daughter is a pure question of law, and that thus, a previous

case before the court between the parties was immaterial, the Supreme Court did not

necessarily decide that the question of whether Kandyan Law applies or not is a pure

question of law. On the contrary, Justice Dheeraratne has stated that a question arising

out of a question of fact or a question which is a combination of a question of fact and

a question of law, a previous judgment is a material consideration.

Upon this basis, the District Court Judge has concluded that the question of

whether a person is a subject of Kandyan law or not is not a pure question of law owing

to the requirement of the proving the circumstantial fact of whether the person in

question is a descendant of a resident of the Kandyan regions as of 1815. As such, the

evidence presented before the court by the 1st Appellant and the Judgement in the

previous case bearing no. 20316P was considered a material fact in the instant case

pertaining to the inheritance of the estate of the said Hemaratne.

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge in his judgement has reaffirmed that

the 1st and 2nd Appellants failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that Hemaratne

was a Kandyan, and Kandyan Law applies to the inheritance of his estate. Further, the

judgement sufficiently notes the difference between the lands in question in the

instant case and the previous 20316P case, by expressly stating the differences of the

names and lot numbers of each land. The High Court Judge has also noted that in the

previous case was concluded without contest and the 1st Appellant as the only party

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 20

giving evidence was not cross examined and 1st Appellant admitted that Baby Nona is

entitled to her share of the land from marital inheritance from Hemaratne.

The High Court Judge further notes that as the 1st Appellant of the present case

was the 1st Plaintiff of the previous case, he is bound by the judgement of the said case

and therefore he is estopped from claiming that devolution of title from Hemaratne

should be determined in accordance with Kandyan Law. In view of the above

mentioned circumstances the High Court Judge has concluded that he is in agreement

with the Additional District Judge in concluding that the judgement of the earlier

partition action operates as Res Judicata in regard to the devolution of title from

Hemaratne in the present case.

I find it pertinent to note that in both the District Court Judgement and the High

Court Judgement of the instant case, the learned Judges have aptly noted the failure

of the Appellants to prove the applicability of Kandyan Law to the said Hemaratne, the

difference between the lands in the previous case bearing no. 20316P and the instant

case bearing no. 22844P, and the observation that the judgement of the previous case

is only relevant to the question of determining the law applicable. As mentioned by

the learned High Court Judge, I am of the view that the Appellants are estopped from

bringing the present claim.

As further enumerated upon by Basnayake C.J in Herath v. The Attorney

General [1958] 60 NLR 193, at pages 217 and 218, unlike in Roman Law, English Law

classifies Res Judicata as a branch of estoppel. A distinction between these two

principles were drawn by Beaman, J. in the Indian case Casamally vs Currimbhoy,

I.L.R 36 BOM. 214 as follows:

Put in the most simple and colloquial way, Res Judicata precludes a man

averring the same thing twice over in successive litigations, while estoppel

prevents him saying one thing at one time and the opposite at another.

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 20

The instant case in addition to the principle of Res Judicata, the concepts pertaining to

estoppel, especially judicial estoppel, are of relevance. Where a competent court which

has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of a dispute, has pronounced

final decision, any party to such litigation, or in the case of a decision in rem any party

whomsoever, as against any other party, is estopped from disputing such a decision

on the merits in a subsequent litigation on the basis of Res Judicata estoppel. The

decision by the District Court Judge in the case bearing no. 20316P operates as Res

Judicata as the decision of the law applicable to Baby Nona pertains to the merits of

the case.

In addressing the matter of whether questions not raised in earlier proceedings,

can operate as Res Judicata in a subsequent proceeding, the opinions expressed by

Wingram VC in Henderson v Henderson (18430) 3 Hare 100 which are of relevance

are reproduced below:

In trying this question I believe I state the rule of the Court correctly when

I say that, where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and

of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires

the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and

will not (except under special circumstances} permit the same

parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter

which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in

contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have,

from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of

their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not

only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties

to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which

properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties,

exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 18 of 20

(Emphasis added)

Further as per Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley in their book The

Doctrine of Res Judicata a party is entitled to the claim that the issue estoppel does

not take effect if a party was excusably ignorant of some matter which would have

altered the whole aspect of the case. However, the estoppel stands if there were no

newly discovered facts, if it was only newly discovered in the sense that the party

realized its importance, if the party had actual knowledge of the fact or might with

reasonable diligence have acquired such knowledge.

This stance is not one that is new to our legal system. The Administration of

Justice (Amendment) Law No. 25 of 1975 which was later repealed stated in Chapter

6 as follows:

Section 491

(1) Subject to the provisions in regard to co-defendants or co-plaintiffs

contained in this section, where a final decision on a controverted question

of law or issue of fact has been pronounced in any action before it by a

Court of competent jurisdiction, any party or privy to such action as

against any other party or privy thereto, and in the case of a decision In

rem any person whomsoever as against any other person, shall in any

subsequent action wherein such question of law or issue of fact is directly

and substantially in issue between them be estopped from disputing or

questioning such decision.

(4) Where the determination of the question of law or issue of fact is not

expressly recorded but is necessarily involved in the adjudication, such

adjudication is itself a decision on the controverted question of law or issue

of fact.

Further in Section 493:

SC Appeal 222/2016 JUDGEMENT Page 19 of 20

(6) Any matter which might or ought to have been made a ground of

defence or attack in the former action shall be deemed to have been a

matter in issue in such action, whether in fact made a ground of defence

or attack or not.

Taking all the above principles of law into account, I find that in the instant case

the question of law applicable to Baby Nona was a question that should have been

raised in the previous case and the 1st Appellant is not entitled to claim ignorance as

there are no newly discovered facts or circumstances. As such the District Court

decision in the case bearing no. 20316P operates as Res Judicata in the present case.

In answering the question of law pertaining to the interpretation of the

judgement of Jayasinghe v. Kiribindu (supra), I am inclined to agree with the

interpretation afforded by the learned District Court Judge, especially in light of the

statements by Justice Dheeraratne in the judgment. It is apparent that the question of

law raised by the parties in the case of Jayasinghe v. Kiribindu was the interpretation

of the relevant statute in determining whether the daughter married in Diga could

acquire Binna rights. An instance of such a pure question of law where the only dispute

is as to the interpretation of law and not of facts or surrounding circumstances, is

dissimilar to a situation as that of the instant case, where the applicability of the law

itself must be proven with facts disputed by the parties.

Decision

Upon perusal of all evidence and submission presented to this Court by the

parties, I find that the 1st Appellant has not provided the court with sufficient evidence

to support the claim that the said Hemaratne is a person subject to Kandyan law and

thus Baby Nona is only entitled to claim Life Interest over the Property. Further, I find

that the learned Additional District Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge have

not erred in law in asserting that the judgment in the previous District Court case

bearing no. 20316P operates as Res Judicata in the instant case.

Taking the aforementioned circumstances into consideration I answer the first

question of law in the negative. I answer the second question of law in the negative as

the learned Judge has acknowledged the differences of the lands as enumerated

above. I am of the view that the third question of law must be answered in the negative

as the learned Judges of the District Court and the High Court have correctly applied

the law established by the mentioned cases as clarified above. Finally, the final question

of law shall be answered in the negative as well. The Respondent shall be entitled to

costs of the litigation to this court, and to costs in respect of the appeal filed in the

High Court.

Appeal dismissed.
