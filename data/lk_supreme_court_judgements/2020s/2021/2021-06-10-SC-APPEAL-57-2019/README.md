By way of Deed of Transfer No. 10950, the Plaintiff-Appellant-

Respondent (Plaintiff) transferred some of her undivided rights

to the land described in the schedule to the Deed to her brother,

the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (Defendant). The Plaintiff

states that although this Deed is ex facie an outright transfer, it

was in fact security for a loan obtained by her from the

Defendant, and there was an oral agreement between them that

the Defendant brother would retransfer the property once she

repaid the loan with interest. The Plaintiffs position is that she

never intended to pass the beneficial interest in the property to

the Defendant thereby resulting in a constructive trust being

created in her favour.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, No. 9 of 1917, as amended,

reads as follows:

4

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and

it cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the

attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of the

beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must

hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative.

The Defendant had also acquired undivided rights to this

property by other Deeds. He filed a partition action to partition

the larger land making the Plaintiff also a Defendant. The

partition case was concluded without contest. The Plaintiff did

not raise her claim to the constructive trust in the partition

action.

The Plaintiff states that the Defendant continuously postponed

the retransfer of the property and she was ultimately compelled

to file this case as a last resort to vindicate her rights.

The Defendant denies this version of the Plaintiff. The defendant

states that the transaction was an outright transfer of the

property and he is not holding the property in trust for the

Plaintiff.

After trial, the District Court held against the Plaintiff on the

basis that the partition decree wiped out the constructive trust,

if any.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal reversed the

Judgment and directed the District Court to enter Judgment for

the Plaintiff.

The Defendant is now before this Court against the Judgment of

the High Court.

5

The Defendant raised several questions of law but this Court

granted leave to appeal on two questions, which in essence is

whether the High Court erred in law when it decided that a

constructive trust is not extinguished by a decree for partition,

notwithstanding that the Plaintiff, being aware of the partition

action, did not claim such a right in the partition action.

In the Partition Ordinance, No. 10 of 1863, section 9 dealt with

the conclusive effect of a partition decree and there was no

express provision protecting constructive trusts after a decree

for partition was entered. Hence there was an ambiguity as to

whether constructive trusts survived a partition decree.

In cases such as Babunona v. Cornelis Appu (1910) 14 NLR 45,

Galgamuwa v. Weerasekera (1919) 21 NLR 108, the Court held

against the survival of a constructive trust, but in cases such as

Sultan v. Sivanadian (1911) 15 NLR 135, Weeraman v. De Silva

(1920) 22 NLR 107, the Court held in favour of the survival of a

constructive trust despite a partition decree being entered.

However this question was set at rest by a Full Bench of the

Supreme Court in Marikar v. Marikar (1920) 22 NLR 137 wherein

the Supreme Court, having reviewed the conflicting previous

decisions authoritatively held:

A trust, express or constructive, is not extinguished by a

decree for partition, and attaches to the divided portion,

which on the partition is assigned to the trustee.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court took the view that section

9 of the Partition Ordinance was not intended to extinguish

equitable interests, and the trustee, being the owner of the

share, represents the beneficiary in respect of it, and a partition

6

decree in favour of the trustee will be conclusive against all

those who may claim the same share or any interest therein but

is not intended to shut out the beneficiary himself.

Dr. L.J.M. Cooray in his treatise The Reception in Ceylon of the

English Trust (1971), justifies this conclusion from a different

perspective. He states at page 209 that notwithstanding the

trust is wiped out by the decree for partition, He [the trustee]

may be regarded as a trustee under a constructive trust (distinct

from the old trust which the decree has wiped out) which

constructive trust arises under section 90 read with section 53 [of

the Trusts Ordinance], when he receives a partition title to the

former trust property under the decree.

This Full Bench decision was followed in subsequent decisions

such as Punchimahatmaya v. Medagama (1949) 51 NLR 276.

Notably, the District Court Judgment in the instant case makes

no reference to Marikar v. Marikar.

The Partition Act, No. 16 of 1951, succeeded the Partition

Ordinance. Unlike the Partition Ordinance, the Partition Act

made special reference to trusts. Section 48(1) of the Partition

Act (which corresponds to section 9 of the Partition Ordinance)

recognised the finality and conclusiveness of a partition decree.

It stated that such a decree is free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in the decree. It further

expounded:

In this subsection encumbrance means any mortgage, lease,

usufruct, servitude, fideicommissum, life interest, trust, or any

interest whatsoever howsoever arising except a constructive or

charitable trust, a lease at will or for a period not exceeding

one month, and the rights of a proprietor of a nindagama.

7

Although the Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Marikars case

held that a trust, be it express or constructive, would not be

extinguished by a partition decree, the Partition Act enacted that a

trust was extinguished by a partition decree unless specifically

reserved in the decree or if it were a constructive or charitable

trust.

When the Defendant in the instant case filed the partition

action, the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, was in force. Similar

to the Partition Act, section 48(1) of the Partition Law endowed

partition decrees with finality devoid of encumbrances other

than those specified in the decree. What is meant by

encumbrance is defined in the Partition Law in the following

manner:

In this subsection and in the next subsection

encumbrance means any mortgage, lease, usufruct,

servitude, life interest, trust, or any interest whatsoever

howsoever arising except a constructive or charitable trust,

a lease at will or for a period not exceeding one month.

Hence, similar to the Partition Act, the Partition Law spares

constructive trusts despite a partition decree being final and

conclusive.

The learned District Judge in this case has accepted that in

terms of section 48(1), a constructive trust is not wiped out by

the entering of a partition decree. But the District Judge

qualifies this by stating that the beneficiary of a constructive

trust can claim the benefit of the said provision only if the

partition decree had been obtained without the beneficiarys

knowledge, and not in an instance where he remained silent

8

having been fully aware of the partition action. The District

Court took the view that as the Plaintiff had kept silent about

the constructive trust after she was made a party to the

partition action, the alleged constructive trust was wiped out by

the partition decree and therefore the Plaintiffs action should

fail. The District Court did not go into the merits of the

Plaintiffs claim despite voluminous evidence being led on the

question of the existence of a constructive trust.

This finding of the District Court is not correct and goes against

the ratio decidendi of Marikars case. Had the learned District

Judge read the Judgment in Herat v. Amunugama (1955) 56 NLR

529, which he cites in his Judgment, he would have realised his

mistake. In Herats case, Gratiaen J. states at pages 534-535:

It has no doubt been authoritatively decided that Section 9

of the Partition Ordinance does not necessarily extinguish

constructive trusts Marikar v. Marikar (1920) 22 NLR

137. In Marikars case (supra) the beneficiary (although a

party) had not put in issue the bare legal estate of the

constructive trustee.

Learned Presidents Council for the Defendant submits that in

Marikars case there was a constructive trust but in the instant

case the Defendant denies any such trust. This is also not

correct. In Marikars case there was no admitted trust. There

was only an alleged constructive trust.

Let me quote the first paragraph of the Judgment in Marikars

case to clear any doubts:

The question for determination in this case relates to an

alleged constructive trust attaching to an undivided share

9

of a land which was the subject of a partition suit. The

person beneficially interested under the alleged trust

though himself otherwise a party to the suit did not assert

a claim to his equitable right in the suit. Judgment was

given, and a decree entered, without any reference to the

trust. The question is therefore, whether, assuming the

existence of the trust, it is extinguished by the decree, or

whether it attaches to the share allotted in severalty.

I must emphasise that at the time Marikars case was decided in

1920, there was no statutory safeguard to preserve constructive

trusts and yet the Supreme Court interpreted section 9 of the

Partition Ordinance (which stated that a partition decree is

conclusive) liberally in order to protect trusts. Subsequent

legislation expressly protected constructive trusts and therefore

there cannot be any doubt on the matter. There is no necessity

to rely on Marikars Judgment any more.

The learned District Judge states that if a person is allowed to

file a separate action to establish a constructive trust in respect

of a portion of land which was the subject matter of a partition

decree to which he was a party, it would lead to an absurd

interpretation of section 48(4) of the Partition Law.

If two interpretations of a statute are possible and one leads to

absurdity and the other is in harmony with common sense and

justice, the Court has the option of selecting the latter. But if

the language of a statute is plain, the Court cannot as a general

rule give a different interpretation on the ground of absurdity.

The intention of the legislature is clear when the legislature in

express terms preserved constructive trusts despite finality of

partition decrees in line with the dicta in Marikars case.

10

The argument of learned Presidents Council for the Defendant is

that the partition decree can be challenged before the District

Court only on the grounds set out in section 48(4) of the

Partition Law and nowhere in that section is it expressly stated

that a partition decree can be challenged by a separate action

filed on the ground of a constructive trust. This position is

untenable because the challenge by the beneficiary is not

against the partition decree but against the trustee.

Notwithstanding the Defendant proposed questions of law in

relation to (a) prescription on a constructive trust, and (b) proof

of the attendant circumstances in establishing a constructive

trust, this Court did not grant leave on those questions. The

High Court has adequately addressed (b) above and concluded

that there exists a constructive trust as claimed by the Plaintiff.

I answer the two questions of law raised on behalf of the

Defendant in the negative.

The Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is affirmed and

the appeal is dismissed with costs.
