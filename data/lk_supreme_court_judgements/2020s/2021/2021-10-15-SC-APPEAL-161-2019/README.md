SC/APPEAL/161/2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs filed this action against the four defendants

seeking a declaration that the 1st and 2nd defendants are holding

the property in suit conveyed by deed No. 256 in trust for the

plaintiffs, and the 2nd defendants transfer of his rights in favour

of the 1st and 3rd defendants by deed No. 11848 is confined to

such limited rights. They sought an order retransferring the

property in their names and damages. No relief was sought

against the 4th defendant bank to whom the property had been

mortgaged and the 4th defendant was later discharged from the

proceedings.

The 1st and 2nd defendants filed the answer seeking dismissal of

the action. The 3rd defendant filed a somewhat perplexing

answer in that the answer commences by denying the averments

in the plaint and concludes by seeking a decree that the 1st and

2nd defendants are holding the property in trust for the plaintiffs.

Notably, the 3rd defendant does not state in the answer that she

is prepared to transfer whatever rights passed on to her by deed

No. 11848 in the name of the plaintiffs. At the trial, the

plaintiffs raised issues seeking all the reliefs prayed for in the

prayer to the plaint, including the reliefs sought against the 3rd

defendant.

Halfway through the trial, the 1st and 2nd defendants made an

application to the District Court to make the 3rd defendant a

plaintiff in the action on the basis that the 3rd defendant

supports the case of the plaintiffs. This application was refused

by the District Court mainly on the ground that it was a belated

application. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside

this order and directed the District Court to add the 3rd

6

SC/APPEAL/161/2019

defendant as the 3rd plaintiff. It is against this Judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal that the plaintiffs have preferred this

appeal.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the Judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal on the questions whether the

impugned Judgment is contrary to inter alia sections 14 and 18

of the Civil Procedure Code, and whether the High Court failed

to consider the reason the 3rd defendant was not made a plaintiff

and the fact that the 3rd defendant has no cause of action

against the 1st and 2nd defendants.

The High Court of Civil Appeal allowed the application of the 1st

and 2nd defendants under section 18(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code, which reads as follows:

The court may on or before the hearing, upon the

application of either party, and on such terms as the court

thinks just, order that the name of any party, whether as

plaintiff or as defendant improperly joined, be struck out;

and the court may at any time, either upon or without such

application, and on such terms as the court thinks just,

order that any plaintiff be made a defendant, or that any

defendant be made a plaintiff, and that the name of any

person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff

or defendant, or whose presence before the court may be

necessary in order to enable the court effectually and

completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions

involved in that action, be added.

The High Court of Civil Appeal highlights that in terms of section

18(1), the court may at any time, either upon or without such

7

SC/APPEAL/161/2019

application, and on such terms as the court thinks just, order that

any plaintiff be made a defendant, or that any defendant be

made a plaintiff.

After the amendments to the Civil Procedure Code by Act No. 9

of 1991 and Act No. 8 of 2017, section 18 of the Civil Procedure

Code cannot be read in isolation but in conjunction with section

93(2). (Colombo Shipping Co Ltd v. Chirayu Clothing Pvt Ltd

[1995] 2 Sri LR 97)

Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

On or after the day first fixed for the Pre-Trial of the action

and before final judgment, no application for the

amendment of any pleadings shall be allowed unless the

Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the Court,

that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such

amendment is not permitted, and on no other ground, and

that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

The basic rule embodied in section 93(2) is that no amendment

of pleadings shall be allowed on or after the day first fixed for the

pre-trial of the action. As this section stands today, the Court

no longer has the discretion to allow the amendment of

pleadings after the day first fixed for the pre-trial of the action.

The Court can now allow the amendment of pleadings after the

day first fixed for the pre-trial of the action if and only if the

Court is satisfied that (a) grave and irremediable injustice would

be caused if such amendment is not permitted and (b) the party

seeking such amendment is not guilty of laches. Both these

requirements must be satisfied, not one. (Kuruppuarachchi v.

Andreas [1996] 2 Sri LR 11)

SC/APPEAL/161/2019

The plaintiffs filed the action on 06.11.2009 and the 3rd

defendant filed the answer on 26.04.2010. The 1st and 2nd

defendants knew the 3rd defendants standpoint by 26.04.2010.

The case was first fixed for trial on 16.12.2010.

This was after the amendment to section 93(2) by Act No. 9 of

1991 but before the amendment by Act No. 8 of 2017. At the

time of Act No. 9 of 1991, there was no pre-trial, only trial. The

only change made to section 93(2) by Act No. 8 of 2017 was the

substitution of the words day first fixed for the trial with the

words day first fixed for the Pre-Trial.

The application to add the 3rd defendant as the 3rd plaintiff

under section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code was made by the

1st and 2nd defendants on 06.11.2015 in the middle of the trial

after voluminous evidence had been recorded on several dates of

hearing. There is no explanation for the delay in making the

application. The 2nd defendant is clearly guilty of laches. Nor

has the Court been convinced that grave and irremediable

injustice would be caused if such amendment is not permitted.

Allowing the application of the 1st and 2nd defendants under

section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code necessarily entails the

amendment of pleadings. It is not just a matter of amending the

caption. The amendment of pleadings was not legally

permissible at the stage the application was made and therefore

the application to add the 3rd defendant as the 3rd plaintiff ought

to have been refused.

The High Court of Civil Appeal took the view that no cause of

action is disclosed in the plaint against the 3rd defendant and

there is no explanation in the plaint as to why the 3rd defendant

9

SC/APPEAL/161/2019

was made a defendant. The plaintiffs have clearly explained in

the plaint the basis upon which the 3rd defendant was brought

in (i.e. the execution of deed No. 11848 by the 2nd defendant in

favour of the 3rd defendant) and the relief sought against her.

This does not appear to be a collusive action as suggested by the

High Court of Civil Appeal.

Can the 3rd defendant be made the 3rd plaintiff on the facts and

circumstances of this case? Section 11 of the Civil Procedure

Code enacts All persons may be joined as plaintiffs in whom the

right to any relief claimed is alleged to exist, whether jointly,

severally, or in the alternative, in respect of the same cause of

action. According to section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, a

cause of action is the wrong for the prevention or redress of

which an action may be brought. The 1st and 2nd defendants

have committed no wrong to the 3rd defendant. Hence no cause

of action has accrued to the 3rd defendant against the 1st and 2nd

defendants. The 3rd defendant, in my view, cannot be made a

plaintiff.

The questions of law in respect of which leave was granted are

answered in the affirmative.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

restore the order of the District Court dated 11.03.2016. The

plaintiffs are entitled to costs in all three Courts recoverable

from the 1st and 2nd defendants.
