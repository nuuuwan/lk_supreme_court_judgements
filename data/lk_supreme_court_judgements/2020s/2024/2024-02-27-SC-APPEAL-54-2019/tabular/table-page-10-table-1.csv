"184/14 Supreme Court  minutes dated 08.09.2022, that a co-owner can  maintain an action to"
"eject a trespasser without making other co-owners parties to the action, and that even if the co-"
"owner claims ownership to the entire land, lesser relief declaring that he is only a co-owner can be"
"granted by a Court. It was also held that prayer for a declaration is not a must in a vindicatory"
"action if the title is averred and proved. Thus, even a co-owner is entitled to obtain the relief of"
"ejectment of a trespasser as per our law. Even if the prayer for declaration of title is not there or"
"defective  for  some  reason,  if  the  title  is  proved  the  prayer  for  ejectment  can  be  granted.    It  is"
"pertinent to note that a co-owner has a right to every grain of sand or every part and portion of the"
"land in dispute to the extent of his share where a trespasser has no right or interest."
