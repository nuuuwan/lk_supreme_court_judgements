"averment in the Plaint which states that the Defendants are estopped from challenging the title of"
"the Plaintiff. By stating so, it appears that the Original Plaintiff relied on the provisions of section"
"116 of the Evidence Ordinance. Thus, prayer for the declaration of title to the property described"
"in the schedule to the Plaint has to be understood in that context as on this occasion the declaration"
"of title to the property is prayed not based on ownership but on contractual relationship that was"
"present between the parties. In Pathirana V Jayasundara 58 N L R 169 a similar situation was"
"explained as follows;"
"“A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way of additional relief either"
"in a rei-vindicatio action proper (which is in truth an action in rem) or in a lessor’s action against"
"his over holding tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the declaration"
"is based on proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of the contractual relationship which forbids"
"a denial that the lessor is the true owner.”"
