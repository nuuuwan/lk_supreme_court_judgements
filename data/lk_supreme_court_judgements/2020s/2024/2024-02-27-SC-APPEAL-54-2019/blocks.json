She could have directly referred to the title her late husband got through the deeds and her right through succession as the wife. As held in Silva V Silva 10 N L R 234, upon a death of a person his/her estate in the absence of a will, passes at once by operation of law to his/her heirs and the dominium vests in them. Thus, to eject the trespassers, if it is a cause of action based on the ownership of the Plaintiff, such as in rei vindicatio action, it was not necessary to plead issuance of limited letters of administration to sue the Defendants. It is pertinent to note, that in Mohamed V Public Trustee (1978-79-80) 1 Sri L R 1, it was held that although the title to the property of a person dying intestate vests on the intestate heirs by operation of law, the property is regarded as vested in the administrator for the purposes of section 472 of the Civil Procedure Code, in strictly limited sense, so as to enable him, in his representative capacity to recover from a third party, what is claimed to be an asset of the intestate estate. [Also see Chelliah V Wijenathan (1951) 54 N L R 337]. Thus, this decision focuses on the ability of an administrator of an estate to file an action to recover possession of the property belonging to the estate in his representative capacity, and it also indicates the capacity of the administrator to claim for title on behalf of the estate as the property is vested in him in that limited sense. By indicating in the Plaint that she obtained the limited letters of administration, the Plaintiff has indicated that she was filing the case in that capacity. It appears that the learned District Judge correctly understood this position and gave the declaration of title to her as the administrator of the estate- vide answer to issue No.13 in the District Court Judgment.",

In coming to his conclusions, the learned District Judge has considered the certified copy of the Deed No.149 dated 09.04.1960 tendered by the Plaintiff (marked as P2 at the trial), the evidence given by the land registry officer confirming that it was a true copy as against the photo copy of the Deed No.149 tendered by the Defendants (marked as V1 at the trial) and the fact relating to the time of death of the alleged predecessor in title of the Defendants who as per the Defendants was the Donee of the said deed. As per the true copy, the Donee was L.W. Leelarathne, one who donated the land to Jagathipala, the Original Plaintiffs husband and for whose estate the Original Plaintiff was given limited letters of administration. Further, the learned District Judge has given reasons to state why he cannot accept the prescriptive claim to the property by the Defendants. On the other hand, as per the chain of title presented by the Defendants, Julius Suludagoda was the original owner who got title through Deed No.149. If so, the deceased Jagathipala who appears to be the brother of the mother of the Defendants should have also become a co-owner with the demise of said Julius Suludagoda. Then to claim prescriptive title, the Defendants must have proved an overt act and adverse possession for ten years from that overt act against the co-owners. The action before the District Court was filed in 2002. As per the Judgment of the learned District Judge, the evidence of the 1st Defendant only refers to a chasing away of the Plaintiff in 1969, when she tried to claim the land. The Plaintiff had marked necessary documents to prove that she obtained limited letters of administration to sue the occupiers in the property described in the schedule to the plaint as well as letters sent as the administrator through her lawyer to terminate license given to the Defendants. It must be noted, when the claim for prescriptive title of the Defendants failed, it is only the licensor licensee relationship averred in the plaint that explains the occupation of the Defendants in the property.

As per the Plaint, Plaintiff was the administrator with limited letters of administration to sue the Defendants. Thus, she has averred facts to indicate that she filed this action in a representative capacity. Even though the exact words to indicate that she was filing in representative capacity were not included, one familiar with law can easily recognize that she has filed the action after obtaining the necessary authority from the testamentary case. Those facts indicate that she filed the action as the Administrator with limited letters of administration to sue the Defendants. It is true that the relevant Form No. 14 included in the First Schedule to the Civil Procedure Code has mentioned the representative character of an administrator in the caption itself. However, the said section 42 does not indicate that it must only be done according to the said form. Section only requires to indicate it in the Plaint. Therefore, the form is only an example showing how the representative character may be indicated in the Plaint. If the body of the Plaint has revealed sufficient material to show the representative character of the Plaintiff, it is sufficient for the purpose of the section. In my view, the Plaintiff sufficiently indicated in the Plaint that she filed the action as the one who held the letters of administration to sue the Defendant. Thus, her representative nature with regard to the estate of the deceased was revealed in the Plaint.",

At the trial, an issue had also been raised on the premise that limited letters of administration had been issued to the Plaintiff. The learned District Judge in his judgment has clearly recognized that the action had been filed as the administrator. That is why he gave the declaration of title on the basis that the Plaintiff is the Administrator of the estate- vide answer to issue No 13. There was no objection or challenge to the status or locus standi of the Plaintiff through issues raised in the action before the District Court. Now if this Court considers to decide the insufficiency of the exposure of the representative character, in a way, this court is going to decide on a matter not placed before the original Court.",

Anyway, I do not intend to do a deep discussion in that aspect as I think sufficient facts have been revealed through averments in the Plaint to recognize that she sued the Defendant in her representative capacity as the Administrator after obtaining the limited letters of administration to sue the Defendants.
