"1)  Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to follow the ratio of"
"Udagama and two others Vs. Chandra Fernando, Inspector General of Police"
"and five others (2011 (1) SLR 192)?"
"2)  Did the learned High Court judge err in law in analyzing the objection of the"
"Accused contrary to the dicta of the Supreme Court?"
"When considering the afore-stated questions of law,  it  is clear that the central issue to be"
"decided  by  this  court  revolves  around  the  interpretation  of  Section  52(1)  of  the  Excise"
"Ordinance which is as follows:"
"(1) No Magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence punishable-"
"a)  under sections 46, 47, or 50, except on his own knowledge or suspicion, or"
"on the complaint or report of an excise officer; or"
"b)  under section 48 or section 49, except on the complaint or report of the"
"Commissioner General of Excise, Government Agent, or an excise officer"
"authorized by either of them on that behalf."
"S
ince the charge against the Accused  is under Section 47(1) of the Excise Ordinance, it  is"
"Section 52(1)(a) that would apply in the instant case. According to section 52(1)(a), it is not"
"open for any Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 47 of the"
"Excise Ordinance upon a complaint of a police officer."
"P
erusal of the Magistrate courts proceedings clearly shows that the Officer in Charge of Police"
"Station  Kegalle  who  is  the  Complainant-Respondent-Respondent  in  the  instant  case  had"
"reported  facts  pertaining  to  the  alleged  detection  under  section  136(1)(b)  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act  to the Magistrate’s Court.  It  is from that  step that  the proceedings"
"against the Accused had been instituted before the Magistrate’s Court. Thus, it is clear that"
"there was no involvement of any excise officer in launching and conducting the prosecution"
"in the instant case against the Accused."
"L
earned Counsel for the Accused relied on the judgment of this court in Udagama and two"
"others vs. Chandra Fernando, Inspector General of Police and five others (hereinafter referred"
"to  as  Udagama’s  Judgment).  This  is  a  judgment  which  this  Court  had  pronounced  in  the"
"exercise  of  its  Fundamental  Rights  Jurisdiction  under  Article  126  of  the  Constitution.  The"
"Petitioners in that case had complained to this Court that certain police officers attached to"
"Pussellawa Police Station had arrested the 3rd Petitioner in that case for allegedly selling arrack"
