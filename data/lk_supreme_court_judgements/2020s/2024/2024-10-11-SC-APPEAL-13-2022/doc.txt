SC/APPEAL/13/2022

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kurunegala in the

year 2004 seeking a declaration that he is the owner of the land described

in the schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the three defendants therefrom,

damages, and costs. The defendants filed a joint answer seeking

dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration that the 1st defendant

is the owner of the land. After trial, the District Court entered judgment

for the plaintiff except for damages. On appeal, the High Court of Civil

Appeal of Kurunegala affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Hence

this appeal by the defendants.

At the commencement of the trial, it was recorded as admissions that, by

the Grant issued under the Land Development Ordinance marked P28,

Vijja became the owner of the land, that Vijja was married to Kiri, and

that both had died by the time of the trial.

Vijja died on 09.03.1994. Prior to his death, on 02.10.1988, he

nominated his wife, Kiri, as his successor (vide P34 at pages 294-295 of

the appeal brief). Learned counsel for the defendant-appellants contends

that the nomination is invalid, asserting that Vijja did not sign the

nomination form and that it was not registered at the Land Registry. This

is the main argument of the appellants. Although the photocopied

document P34 in the appeal brief seems to support this claim, an

inspection of the original document P34 in the District Court case record

reveals that Vijja placed his thumb impression instead of a signature,

and the Land Registry seal confirms the registration of the nomination

on 21.10.1988.

After the death of Vijja, as evidenced by P29, the Divisional Secretary of

Polpithigama conveyed the land to Kiri. This conveyance was duly

registered at the Land Registry on 05.12.1995 (vide V1). The document

3

SC/APPEAL/13/2022

marked P32/V2 confirms that Kiri nominated the plaintiff, Suramba, as

her successor, and this nomination was also registered at the Land

Registry.

P31 shows that on 14.07.1999, the Divisional Secretary of Polpithigama

granted written permission to Kiri to convey the land to the plaintiff,

subject to the life interest of Kiri. The draft Deed was approved by the

Divisional Secretary of Polpithigama on 21.07.1999 (vide P30C), and the

land was subsequently gifted to the plaintiff by Kiri through the Deed

marked P30 dated 22.07.1999, which has also been registered at the

Land Registry.

All the documents marked at the trial are either originals or duly certified

copies issued by the Divisional Secretary or the Land Registry. At the

conclusion of the plaintiffs case, there was no objection raised regarding

the proof of these documents. I am fully satisfied that the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance have been duly complied with in these

transactions.

The 1st defendant, Punchihapu, claims title to the land as the sister of

Vijja. The 2nd and 3rd defendants are her children. This claim of the 1st

defendant is patently unsustainable in law. She does not state that the

above-mentioned documents are forged documents. What she states in

the answer tendered to the District Court is that those documents were

obtained by misleading government officials. This allegation is baseless.

This Court had previously granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court fail to consider that the plaintiff has failed to

prove her title to the property?

(b) Did the High Court fail to consider that Vijja has not nominated

Kiri as his successor?

SC/APPEAL/13/2022

(c) Did the High Court fail to consider that Kiri was not entitled to

dispose of the holding?

(d) Did the High Court fail to consider that P34 does not have the

signature of Vijja?

(e) Was the purported nomination not duly registered in the proper

folio at the Land Registry?

(f) Did the District Court and the High Court err in law by holding

that acts of the Divisional Secretary have to be challenged by way

of a writ?

I answer all the questions in the negative. This appeal is manifestly devoid

of merit.

The judgments of the District Court and the High Court are affirmed, and

the appeal is dismissed with costs.
