    SC/APPEAL/13/2022"
"Samayawardhena, J."
"The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kurunegala in the"
"year 2004 seeking a declaration that he is the owner of the land described"
"in the schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the three defendants therefrom,"
"damages,  and  costs.  The  defendants 
filed  a 
joint  answer  seeking"
"dismissal of the plaintiffâ€™s action and a declaration that the 1st defendant"
"is the owner of the land. After trial, the District Court entered judgment"
"for the plaintiff except for damages.  On appeal, the  High Court  of Civil"
"Appeal of Kurunegala affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Hence"
"this appeal by the defendants."
"At the commencement of the trial, it was recorded as admissions that, by"
"the Grant issued under the Land Development Ordinance marked P28,"
"Vijja became the owner of the land, that Vijja was married to Kiri, and"
"that both had died by the time of the trial."
"Vijja  died  on  09.03.1994.  Prior 
to  his  death,  on  02.10.1988,  he"
"nominated his wife, Kiri, as his successor (vide P34 at pages 294-295 of"
"the appeal brief). Learned counsel for the defendant-appellants contends"
"that  the  nomination  is  invalid,  asserting  that  Vijja  did  not  sign  the"
"nomination form and that it was not registered at the Land Registry. This"
"is  the  main  argument  of  the  appellants.  Although  the  photocopied"
"document  P34  in  the  appeal  brief  seems  to  support  this  claim,  an"
"inspection of the original document P34 in the District Court case record"
"reveals  that  Vijja  placed  his  thumb  impression  instead  of  a  signature,"
"and the Land Registry seal confirms the registration of the nomination"
"on 21.10.1988."
"After the death of Vijja, as evidenced by P29, the Divisional Secretary of"
"Polpithigama  conveyed  the 
land  to  Kiri.  This  conveyance  was  duly"
"registered at the Land Registry on 05.12.1995 (vide V1). The document"
