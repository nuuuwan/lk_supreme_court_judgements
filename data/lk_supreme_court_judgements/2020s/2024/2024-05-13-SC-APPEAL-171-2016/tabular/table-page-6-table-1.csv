"for the 1st and 2nd Defendants also brings to the attention of Court that the Surveyor also had"
"raised  the  issue  of  undesirability to partition  the  land  in  that  manner  in the  report  he  had"
"submitted with regard to the proposed Scheme of Partition marked X 8."
"A
ccording to the proposed Scheme of Partition (Plan No. 1047 dated prepared on 04-11-2010"
"by K. G. Krishnapillai (Licensed Surveyor), the corpus which is Lot A has been sub-divided into"
"three Lots, depicted as A1 , A2 , A3. Their extents are given as follows:"
"A1   -     0 A,   0 R,   2.535 P."
"A2   -     0 A,   0 R,   2.535 P."
"A3   -     0 A,   0 R,   05.07 P."
"Total extent of Lot  
A 
= 0 A,   0 R,   10.14 P."
"W
e observe that the fact that the afore-mentioned proposed Scheme of Partition would result"
"in  allotting  to the  parties,  the  extents  which  would  become  less  than  the  minimum  extent"
"required to be maintained by written law regulating the subdivision of lands for development"
"purposes in terms of Section 26(3) of the Partition Law (as amended by Act No. 17 of 1997)"
"has been clearly adverted to, by the Surveyor in his report produced, marked X 8(1), in this"
"proceeding. The Surveyor has stated this position in his report as follows:"
"“Lot A has been allotted in common to the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant & 2nd Defendant"
"i
n
 
terms of the Section 13 in the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 1977 [sic] 5"
"as the individual extent is less than written law of the Urban Development"
"Authority.”"
"W
e further observe that the learned District Judge in fact has made a conclusion in his Order6"
"on the issue of the subdivisions becoming less than the minimum extent required by written"
"law7 in terms of Section 26(3) of the Partition Law. We note that this is the District Court order"
"which has been impugned by the 1st and 2nd Defendants before the Provincial High Court of"
"Civil  Appeals.    Therefore,  it  is  clear  to  us  that  it  is  not  factually  correct  to  categorize  this"
"objection as an objection which the 1st and 2nd Defendants had raised orally for the first time"
"in the appeal before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals."
"5 Section 13 of the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 1997 has amended Section 26(3) of the"
"Partition Law No. 21 of 1977; thus, the reference by the Surveyor therein must be taken as a"
"reference to Section 26(3) of the  Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 as amended by Act No. 17 of 1997."
"6 In paragraph 02 of page 08 of the Order dated 27-09-2023  produced marked X 12."
