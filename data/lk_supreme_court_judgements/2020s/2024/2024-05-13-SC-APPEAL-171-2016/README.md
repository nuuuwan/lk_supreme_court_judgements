ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 13-05-2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Defendant-

Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Defendants) and also the

submissions of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Plaintiff) and concluded the argument of this case.

This is a partition action in which the learned Additional District Judge had entered the

interlocutory decree in accordance with the findings in the judgment dated 15-06-2009.

Although there had been several further litigations thereafter also in appellate Courts, no party

has been successful in contesting the share allotments made by the District Court in the said

judgment dated 15-06-2009. Accordingly, the interlocutory decree entered on 04-11-2009 has

continued to remain in force to date.

After the Surveyor made his return to the commission issued by Court proposing a Scheme of

Partition, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had filed their statement of objections to the said

proposed Scheme of Partition. The said objection was raised on the basis that the 1st and 2nd

Defendants should get an enhanced compensation as per the valuation report they had

submitted marked 2. The 1st and 2nd Defendants in the said objections had claimed that

they had made improvements to the upstairs portion of the building situated in Lot A31 which

has been allotted by the proposed Scheme of Partition, to the Plaintiff. Thus, in view of the

said allotment to the Plaintiff, it was the position of the 1st and 2nd Defendants that they should

have been granted a compensation of Rs. 641,631.00 instead of Rs. 3000.00. We note that

the sum of Rs. 3000.00 as compensation has been calculated on the basis that the 1st and

2nd Defendants are entitled only for 790 square feet out of a total of 1600 square feet. The

learned Additional District Judge after the inquiry conducted in that regard, by his order dated

1 Lot A3 of Plan No. 1047 dated 04-11-20210 prepared by K. G. Krishnapillai Licensed Surveyor.

[SC APPEAL 171/2016] - Page 4 of 7

27-09-2013, had rejected the claim for enhanced compensation put forward by the 1st and 2nd

Defendants for the afore-said improvements they have claimed.

Being aggrieved with the order dated 27-09-2013 pronounced by the learned Additional

District Judge, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had filed a Leave to Appeal Petition in the Civil

Appellate High Court. The Civil Appellate High Court had granted Leave to Appeal to that

Petition. After the argument, the Civil Appellate High Court by its judgment dated 12-01-2016

had proceeded to dismiss that appeal. The said judgment dated 12-01-2016 is a one-page

judgment and hence it would be convenient to reproduce its entirety for the purpose of

adjudicating this appeal. The judgment states as follows:

The defendants have filed this appeal with leave obtained from the previous

Bench against the order of the District Judge dated 27.09.2013 whereby the

Final Partition Plan has been confirmed. This has been done after an inquiry

upon the statement of objections filed by the defendants dated 31.03.2011

against the acceptance of the Final Plan. The only point raised in the said

statement of objections by the defendants is the inadequacy of compensation

awarded to them by the Court Commissioner to be paid by the plaintiff. At the

inquiry the 2nd defendant has given evidence and in his evidence too he has

stressed only on that point. Thereafter the further inquiry to call further

witnesses by the defendants has been postponed. Nearly two years after the

evidence of the 2nd defendant an altogether new objection has been made by

the defendants orally 2 to the effect that in the circumstances of this case no

partition is possible but land has to be sold and proceeds to be distributed

among parties. This is clearly an afterthought, and it is this new objection which

has basically been overruled by the District Judge in the impugned order.

A party to an action cannot present a case at the trial or inquiry materially

different from what he has placed on record. (Ranasinghe v. Somawathie

[2004] 2 Sri LR 154, Hildon v. Munaweera [1997] 3 Sri LR 220, Gnananathan v.

Premawardane [1999] 3 Sri LR 301)

Appeal is dismissed with costs.

Being aggrieved with the said judgment dated 12-01-2016 pronounced by the Civil Appellate

High Court, the 1st and 2nd Defendants have lodged the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant to

the instant appeal in this Court. This Court after hearing the submissions of both parties by

its order dated 19-09-2016, has granted Leave to Appeal on the following question of law.

Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred and/or misdirected itself in law by failing

to appreciate and/or determine, that a legal objection can be raised at any time

during the pendency of an action or appeal, and hence, the Petitioners were

entitled to raise the objection pertaining to the fact that the partitioning of the

land was impracticable and unenforceable, even though the same may not have

specifically been pleaded in the said Statement of Objections of the Petitioners?

Perusal of the Petition of Appeal3 dated 10-10-2013 produced marked X 13 in this proceeding

shows clearly that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had canvassed several matters pertaining to the

claim for improvement they had agitated before the District Court. This is found in paragraph

(8) of their Petition of Appeal filed in the Civil Appellate High Court. The grounds of appeal

relied upon by the 1st and 2nd Defendants in the Civil Appellate High Court are found in

paragraphs 9(a) - 9(f) of the said Petition. However, it is clear that the Provincial High Court

of Civil Appeals has not considered any of the grievances of the 1st and 2nd Defendants in its

judgment dated 12-01-2016.

The reference to the grievance set out in paragraph 9(c)4 by the learned Judge of the Civil

Appellate High Court in his judgment is simply to state that he was not prepared to consider

that grievance as he had taken the view that it was raised orally for the first time in the appeal

before the Civil Appellate High Court. Thus, the grievance of the 1st and 2nd Defendants in

paragraph 9(c) of the Petition also remain unresolved by the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals.

We observe that the concern of a presence of a legal impediment to partition the corpus into

further subdivisions is not a concern that has been raised for the first time in the appeal before

the Civil Appellate High Court as claimed by the learned Judge of the Civil Appellate High

Court. The documents in the record bear testimony to that fact. Learned Presidents Counsel

for the 1st and 2nd Defendants also brings to the attention of Court that the Surveyor also had

raised the issue of undesirability to partition the land in that manner in the report he had

submitted with regard to the proposed Scheme of Partition marked X 8.

According to the proposed Scheme of Partition (Plan No. 1047 dated prepared on 04-11-2010

by K. G. Krishnapillai (Licensed Surveyor), the corpus which is Lot A has been sub-divided into

three Lots, depicted as A1 , A2 , A3. Their extents are given as follows:

A1 - 0 A, 0 R, 2.535 P.

A2 - 0 A, 0 R, 2.535 P.

A3 - 0 A, 0 R, 05.07 P.

Total extent of Lot A = 0 A, 0 R, 10.14 P.

We observe that the fact that the afore-mentioned proposed Scheme of Partition would result

in allotting to the parties, the extents which would become less than the minimum extent

required to be maintained by written law regulating the subdivision of lands for development

purposes in terms of Section 26(3) of the Partition Law (as amended by Act No. 17 of 1997)

has been clearly adverted to, by the Surveyor in his report produced, marked X 8(1), in this

proceeding. The Surveyor has stated this position in his report as follows:

Lot A has been allotted in common to the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant & 2nd Defendant

in terms of the Section 13 in the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 1977 [sic] 5

as the individual extent is less than written law of the Urban Development

Authority.

We further observe that the learned District Judge in fact has made a conclusion in his Order6

on the issue of the subdivisions becoming less than the minimum extent required by written

law7 in terms of Section 26(3) of the Partition Law. We note that this is the District Court order

which has been impugned by the 1st and 2nd Defendants before the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals. Therefore, it is clear to us that it is not factually correct to categorize this

objection as an objection which the 1st and 2nd Defendants had raised orally for the first time

in the appeal before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals.

5 Section 13 of the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 1997 has amended Section 26(3) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977; thus, the reference by the Surveyor therein must be taken as a reference to Section 26(3) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 as amended by Act No. 17 of 1997. 6 In paragraph 02 of page 08 of the Order dated 27-09-2023 produced marked X 12. 7 Regulating the subdivision of lands for development purposes.

[SC APPEAL 171/2016] - Page 7 of 7

Thus, for the above reasons, we hold that the assertion by the learned Judge of the Civil

Appellate High Court, i.e., the assertion that the said grievance was raised by the 1st and 2nd

Defendants orally for the first time in the appeal before the Civil Appellate High Court is clearly

a factually erroneous conclusion. We see no justification for the said conclusion reached in

the judgment dated 12-01-2016 pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals.

For the foregoing reasons, we proceed to answer the question of law in respect of which this

Court has granted Leave to Appeal as follows:

The Civil Appellate High Court has erred and/or misdirected itself in law by

holding that the concern of a presence of a legal impediment in terms of Section

26(3) of the Partition Law to partition the corpus into further subdivisions is a

concern that has been orally raised by the 1st and 2nd Defendants for the first

time in the appeal before the Civil Appellate High Court.

Thus, in view of the answer provided for the above question of law, the impugned judgment

dated 12-01-2016, pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals cannot be

permitted to stand. We proceed to set aside the judgment dated 12-01-2016 pronounced by

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. We direct the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals

to consider the appeal filed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants afresh and thereafter pronounce

judgment according to law.
