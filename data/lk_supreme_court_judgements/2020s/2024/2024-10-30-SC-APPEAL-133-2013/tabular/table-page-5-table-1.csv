"SC APPEAL 133/2013"
"proof, as said before the Counsel for the Plaintiff at the close of Plaintiff’s case has not read"
"this in evidence apparently due to inadvertence. The Defendant has reiterated his objections"
"made to  the documents.  The  Plaintiff has not  called  any  witness, namely the surveyor  who"
"surveyed  and  drew  it  or  any  officer  involved  in  approving  it  from  the  Government  Survey"
"Department, Ratnapura to prove the said plan."
"However, this Court observes that there was no real dispute as to the identity of the corpus"
"involved in this action. As per the description in the schedule to the Answer, it is very much"
"the same land described in the schedule A to the Plaint. As per the body of the  Answer, in"
"answering the averments in the plaint, the Defendant has not denied the land described in the"
"plaint but has claimed it on a permit and has also averred how he has improved it by putting up"
"a house worth Rs.300,000/- and plantation worth Rs.350,000/- to claim damages, in case the"
"Plaintiff succeeds. Thus, there seems to have no contest to say that the Defendant is occupying"
"a different land as per the pleadings itself. The case between the parties as per the pleadings is"
"that the Plaintiff claims the Lot 157 of the Springwood estate on a permit marked P1 (which is"
"in fact a Grant) and the Defendant claims the same based on a permit No.75/1441. This Court"
"observes that there is a discrepancy between the schedule A of the plaint which describes the"
"main land and schedule B of the plaint which describes the alleged encroached portion with"
"regard to the extent as the encroached portion is given a bigger extent. However, when looking"
"at the description of boundaries of both schedules it is apparent that it has to be a mistake and"
"schedule B should be lesser in extent."
"Thus,  if  the  Plaintiff  could  prove  that  the  grant  he  has  is  lawful  and  the  Defendant  was  a"
"trespasser, he could have maintained a successful rei vindicatio action. The plan marked P5"
"and  its  report  mentioned  above,  which  was  marked  subject  to  proof,  only  show  the  ground"
"situation on the land namely, the exact portion the Defendant was occupying, details relating"
"to plantations and buildings etc. at the time of the said survey. Not proving P5 and its report"
"may not have caused much harm if the Plaintiff was able to prove his cause of action for which"
"he needs to prove that he is the lawful title holder and the Defendant is in possession without a"
"lawful ground. It is true that in a rei vindicatio action, the Plaintiff must prove his case and if"
"it is not proved, the Defendant is not bound to prove anything. Even though P5 was marked"
"subject to proof, as per the case record it has to be considered that the Defendant waived such"
"objection prior to the Judgment since while giving his evidence, the Defendant has admitted it"
"in his evidence-in-chief itself- vide page 185 and 186 of the brief. What is admitted by parties"
"need not be proved. This admission shows that his original objection to  mark  P5 subject to"
"proof is either an unscrupulous act or the relevant lawyer has acted contrary to his instructions."
"As said before, the Plaintiff has not called any witness from the Authority which prepared and"
"took steps to issue P1 when it had been marked in evidence subject to proof. Subject to that,"
"even  though  there  is  a  difference  between  the  Plaintiff’s  true  name  which  is  Weerasinghe"
"Arachchige Ramenika and the name in P1 which is Weerakkodi Arachchige Ramenika   the"
"Court could have assumed that the name difference was a mistake, if it was a genuine grant, as"
"it was produced from the custody of the Plaintiff. In the same manner, if it was a genuine grant,"
"the Court could have assumed that, even though the signature of the President on P1 appears"
"to  have been scored  off, it is the  placement of the correct  signature as  a true sample of the"
"signature of the President has not been tendered in evidence to show that what is on P1 is not"
"the signature of the President or what is on P1 has not been scored off even though it appears"
"as scored off. The land development officer of the Divisional Secretariat of Kollonne who gave"
