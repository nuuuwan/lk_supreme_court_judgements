"SC APPEAL 133/2013"
"(b) The State by a permit marked as P1 with the plaint which was issued in terms of section"
"19(1) of the Land Development Ordinance, conveyed the land described in the schedule ""A"""
"to the plaint to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also acquired prescriptive title due to the long period"
"of possession from 1987,"
"(c) The Defendant in the year 1993 illegally entered into a portion of the said land and has"
"commenced illegal possession of the portion of land described in the schedule ""B"" to the Plaint,"
"d)  The  Plaintiff,  accordingly,  got  the  said  land  surveyed  before  the  Grama  Niladari  and"
"prepared a plan marked P2 with the plaint."
"Accordingly, the Plaintiff in the said plaint prayed for a declaration of title to the land described"
"in schedule ""A"" to the plaint, ejectment of the Defendant and all others under him from the"
"land described in Schedule ""B"" to the plaint, for damages in a sum of Rs.500/- per month from"
"the Defendant until the Plaintiff's possession is restored and, costs."
"However, this Court observes that the document P1 dated 24.07.1986, found in the brief is not"
"a  permit  as  described  in  the  plaint  but  a  grant  issued  in  terms  of  section  19(4)  of  the  Land"
"Development Ordinance. The document found in the brief marked P2 cannot be identified as a"
"plan made before the Grama Niladari after the alleged encroachment that took place after the"
"said land was conveyed to her by P1, but a line drawing of a village plan made in 08.10.1985."
"The aforesaid plan is also referred to in the said document marked P1in describing the land."
"The Defendant filed his Answer dated 11.05.2000 and took up the position that the Defendant"
"was  in  possession  of  the  land  described  in  the  Answer  from  1969  and  he  received  written"
"permission from the State in 1972 for his possession. The Defendant has further stated that"
"after obtaining government aid, he put up a house in the said land. The  Defendant has also"
"stated that in terms of the entries in the land ledger in the Kollonne, Divisional Secretariat, he"
"has  been  issued  with  the  permit  No.75/1441(sometimes  referred  to  as  permit  No.1441  in"
"evidence and in this judgment) for the said land and thus, he is entitled to the said land. The"
"Defendant  alleged  in  his  answer  that  the  Plaintiff  has  sold  her  land  in  Sooriyakanda  to  her"
"brother and is disputing the Defendant's land. While estimating his house and plantation to a"
"value of Rs.650,000/-, the Defendant had prayed, inter alia, for a dismissal of the Plaintiff's"
"action and for a declaration in favour of the Defendant in respect of the land described in the"
"schedule to the Answer. The land described in the schedule to the Answer, when consider with"
"the contents in the body of the Answer, aforesaid P2 and the given boundaries, is the same land"
"described in the schedule A to the plaint. The Plaintiff claimed the land based on a grant marked"
"P1 with plaint and Defendant claimed it based on a permit issued to him."
"The Plaintiff filed her Replication dated 03.08.2000 and, inter alia, prayed for a dismissal of"
"the Claim in Reconvention of the Defendant."
"Originally the trial was commenced on 09.11.2000. However, it appears that owing to certain"
"facts revealed during the evidence of the official witness called on behalf of the Defendant, the"
"then learned District Judge had directed the said witness to hold an inquiry with regard to the"
"issuance of the grant in relation to the disputed land and submit a report – vide page 101 of the"
"brief. After the receipt of said report along with a plan made in that regard, considering the"
"submissions  made  by  the  parties,  the  learned  District  Judge  who  succeeded  the  previous"
"District Judge had decided to commence the trial afresh – vide page 105 of the brief."
