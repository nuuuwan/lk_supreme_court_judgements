"SC APPEAL 133/2013"
"undertaking, his prospective permit is not liable to be cancelled in favour of another person."
"Furthermore, Alles J held;"
"“Indeed,  in  my  view,  the  permit  that  the  Plaintiff  has  successfully  obtained  in  this  case  is"
"nothing less than a worthless piece of paper”-at page 454 of the said judgment"
"Hence,  Alles  J  concluded  in  that  case  that  the  permit  obtained  in  contrary  to  the  accepted"
"procedure of Land Development Ordinance, tainted with irregularity does not give valid title."
"It appears to be the policy of Land Development Ordinance to issue a new permit or grant,"
"earlier permit to be necessarily cancelled – vide S.C. Appeal No.119/2010 Wimala Herath Vs"
"M.D.G. Kamalawathi reported in (2013) 2 Sri L R 60."
"In the matter at hand, it appears that the grant was issued when in fact a permit was issued to"
"the Defendant as per the entries in V3, and without canceling it."
"The Defendant giving evidence has stated that he has been residing in the Lot 157 from 1968,"
"built a temporary house in 1968, and thereafter put up a permanent house in 1975. He further"
"has stated that as per the entries in the Divisional Secretariat and the ledger entry marked V3"
"he is the one who is entitled to the permit No. is 75/1441. He has also stated that he was given"
"aid by the Government Agent’s office to build his house on this land. A document which is"
"also marked as V5 found at page 313 of the brief has been submitted in evidence in this regard."
"The  said  V5  is  a  document  relating  to  paying  of  financial  aid  to  permit  holders  and  said"
"document contains the name of the Defendant and the permit number which is 75/1441. This"
"document supports the Defendant’s position that he is a permit holder and he put up a house"
"with the aid given by the government agent’s office. The Defendant has referred to the aforesaid"
"documents marked V3 to V6 to show that he has made various payments such as acreage tax."
"The Defendant, while giving evidence, has admitted that the Divisional Secretary Manawadu"
"held an inquiry on a commission issued by the District Court and tendered the report marked"
"V2. As mentioned before, the Defendant has further admitted the plan marked P5 sent along"
"with the said report. Even though he is the permit holder as per the ledger entry marked V3,"
"the answers given in cross examination show that the Defendant has not been physically given"
"a permit using the prescribed form. The Defendant wonders why the grant was given to the"
"Plaintiff without giving him a permit in its physical form."
"Sirisena  Manawadu,  retired  Divisional  Secretary  has  given  evidence  and  confirmed  that  he"
"prepared the report marked V2 in terms of the direction given by the District Court, which was"
"marked through the Plaintiff when she was giving evidence. In that regard, he has also stated"
"that he took steps to make the plan marked P5 and its report through a government surveyor."
"He has further confirmed that the statements marked V2a were made by the Plaintiff and the"
"Defendant.  The  V2  report  made  by  the  said  witness  indicates  that  the  said  witness  on  the"
"direction of the Court perused what was available in the office and also did a field observation."
"The report says originally the Lot 157 was given to one Dinoris Hamy. After cancelling the"
"said permit it has been given to the Defendant on 13.10.1972 on the permit No.1441. As per"
"the  said  report,  the  Plaintiff  had  been  given  a  land  under  the  permit  No.1444  and  now  her"
"brother resides in the land relevant to the said permit given to her. The report says that during"
"the field visit the Plaintiff was not able to show the boundaries but the boundaries shown by"
"the Defendant corresponded with the boundaries of the plan. This report was originally marked"
"subject  to  proof  when  the  Plaintiff  gave  evidence.  When  the  author  of  the  report,  Sirisena"
