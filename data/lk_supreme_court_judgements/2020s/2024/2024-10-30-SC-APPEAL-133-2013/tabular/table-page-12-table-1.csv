"SC APPEAL 133/2013"
"Answer:"
"Yes."
"Question:"
"(d) Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law by arriving at the finding that"
"the  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  identify  the  land  in  dispute,  and  by  setting  aside  the  said"
"Judgment of the District Court?"
"Answer:"
"Yes, they erred in law arriving at a finding that the Plaintiff has failed to identify the"
"land in  dispute  and setting  aside the District  Court judgment  on that ground but  the"
"District Court Judgment should have been set aside on the grounds explained above in"
"this  judgment,  especially  not  proving  the  cause  of  action  of  the  Plaintiff.  Thus,  the"
"conclusion of the learned High Court judges to set aside the District Court’s judgment"
"has to be affirmed as it should be the correct decision for the reasons given above in"
"this judgment. The High Court Judges have failed to see that the cause of action of the"
"Plaintiff has not been proved due to other grounds as explained above."
"Among other things in the prayer to the petition, the Plaintiff has prayed to set aside the High"
"Court judgment and affirm the District Court judgment or to enter judgment in favour of the"
"Plaintiff. As for the reasons given in this judgment, District Court Judgment cannot be affirmed"
"and a judgment in favour of the Plaintiff cannot be entered. For the same reasons, the judgment"
"of the High Court cannot be totally set aside as the decision to set aside the judgment of the"
"District Court has to be affirmed but, reasons given in the said High Court judgment for such"
"setting aside of the District Court judgment have to stand amended in accordance with reasons"
"given in this judgment."
"Hence, this appeal for the setting aside of the High Court Judgment and affirming of the District"
"Court Judgment or entering a judgment in favour of the Plaintiff is dismissed but, as for the"
"reasons given above the grounds for setting aside the District Court Judgment as given in the"
"High Court Judgment should stand amended on par with the reasons given in this judgment."
"Hence, the Appeal of the Plaintiff is dismissed. No Costs."
