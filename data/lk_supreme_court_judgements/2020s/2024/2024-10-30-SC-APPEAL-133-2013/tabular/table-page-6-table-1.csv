"SC APPEAL 133/2013"
"evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff has stated that P1 is a lawful document in his evidence-in-"
"chief 2 but, as he has stated that it was a one prepared by the Government Agent’s office3 (May"
"be referring to the Provincial Secretariat), it is questionable whether he is a suitable witness to"
"affirm  the  genuineness  of  P1.  It  must  be  noted  that  this  witness  has  also  admitted  that  the"
"signature of the President has been stricken off.4 If a witness from the relevant office which"
"prepared and took steps to issue P1 was called to give evidence, he could have revealed and"
"clarified whether P1 was a genuine document and the matters relating to the aforesaid signature"
"of the President. Even if it is considered for the sake of argument that officer from Divisional"
"Secretariat, Kollonne is sufficient to prove P1 and/or that it can be presumed that all official"
"acts have been duly performed and P1 need not be further proved, following facts revealed in"
"evidence stand against the proof of plaintiff’s cause of action."
"As per the evidence of the said land development officer, prior to issuing the grant, Weerakkodi"
"Arachchige Ramenike had been issued with a permit No.78/1448 and the Defendant had been"
"issued with a permit No.1441 marked V3. In fact, V3 is the ledger entry relating to the permit"
"issued to the Defendant. Said witness admits that the land relevant to the matter at hand is the"
"land given on permit to the Defendant- vide page 150 and 151 of the brief. However, in the"
"aforesaid Grant P1, which was produced in evidence by the Plaintiff, Lot 157, which is the land"
"relevant to this matter, has been given to  Weerakkodi Arachchige Ramenike. The said land"
"officer while giving evidence has stated that it may be an error and it can be cured by the Land"
"Commissioner and there has been an attempt to  settle the  dispute at that level but, since an"
"action has been filed that process has been stayed and not concluded yet- vide pages 152 and"
"153 of the brief."
"V2 and V2a have been marked subject to proof through Plaintiff during her cross examination"
"by the Defendant5. Out of them V2a, is a statement made by the Plaintiff herself and she is the"
"Author of that statement and V2, is a report made by the Divisional Secretary, Kollonne. It"
"appears that at the close of the Defendant’s case, the objection has been reiterated- vide J.E"
"dated 14.08.2006 at page 34 of the brief. However, V2a has been marked through the Plaintiff"
"herself and the Plaintiff’s witness, aforesaid land development officer also has admitted it as"
"the  statement  made  by  the  Plaintiff  –  vide  page  155  of  the  brief.  The  Defendant’s  witness,"
"Sirisena Manawadu, retired Divisional Secretary has given evidence regarding the making of"
"the said report marked V2 and the making of the statement marked V2a by the Plaintiff- vide"
"pages 177 and 178 of the brief. Thus, two documents marked V2 and V2a have been proved."
"In V2a, the Plaintiff has admitted that the Defendant, Peter Fernandolage John has built a house"
"in the portion of land the Defendant seized and occupied, which was given to the Defendant by"
"the State and, the Defendant had planted tea in that land. What she has asked in her statement"
"is to give the Defendant the part of the land where he has built his house and to give her the"
"balance portion of the land. What is important is that the Plaintiff in the aforesaid statement"
"has  admitted  that  the  Defendant  has  built  the  house  in  the  land  which  was  given  to  the"
"Defendant  by  the  State.  Even  the  Plaintiff  while  giving  evidence  has  admitted  that  the"
"Defendant resides in the land given to him by the State and she has no objection to it. However,"
"she attempts to state that she resides in her land- vide pages 139 and 140 of the brief. If the"
