Quite apart from any question of estoppel or prejudice, to permit admissions to be withdrawn in these circumstances would subvert some of the most fundamental principles of the Civil Procedure Code in regard to pleadings and issues.

Further, the eagerness of the appellant to rely on the inquiry notes of the police [which were produced by the plaintiff, and were available at the time the 3rd defendant indicated to court that evidence will not be led on her behalf] to justify the application to lead the evidence of the 3rd defendant, amply demonstrate the real reason for the belated application, viz; to avoid payment of damages and that too, by the insurer of the bus at a subsequent point of time.",
