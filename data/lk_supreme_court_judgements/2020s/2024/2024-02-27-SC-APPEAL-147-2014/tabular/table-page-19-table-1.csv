"may equally well have been the result of express instructions given by the"
"client.  An  additional  circumstance  is  that,  had  these  admissions  not  been"
"made,  the  plaintiff  would  have  had  an  opportunity  of  reconsidering  this"
"position, and may then have decided to withdraw his action and to institute"
"another  action  on  a  different  basis;  the  denial  of  that  opportunity  was  a"
"potential  source  of  prejudice,  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  was  in  error  in"
"assuming that the plaintiff had suffered no prejudice, or had not acted to his"
"detriment, where he had no chance of explaining how he would have acted."
"Quite apart from any question of estoppel or prejudice, to permit admissions"
"to  be  withdrawn  in  these  circumstances  would  subvert  some  of  the  most"
"fundamental principles of the Civil Procedure Code in regard to pleadings"
"and  issues.  Section  75  not  only  requires  a  defendant  to  admit  or  deny  the"
"several  averments  of  the  plaint,  but  also  to  set  out  in  detail,  plainly  and"
"concisely, the matters of fact and law, and the circumstances of the case upon"
"which he means to rely for his defence; sections 146(2) and 148 oblige the"
"Court upon the pleadings, or upon the contents of documents produced, and"
"after  examination  of  the  parties  if  necessary,  to  ascertain  the  material"
"propositions of fact or of law upon which the parties are at variance, and"
"thereupon to record issues on which the right decision of the case depends;"
"section 150, explanation (2), prohibits a party from making at the trial a case"
"materially different from that which he has placed on record, and which his"
"opponent is prepared to meet; the facts proposed to be established by a party"
"must in the whole amount to so much of the material part of his case as is"
"not admitted in his opponent’s pleadings”. (emphasis added)"
