"and the understanding of the judge relating to a dominant tenement losing his servitude over a"
"servient tenement."
"H
aving propounded the above statement Bertram CJ., went onto opine that in the said"
"case, “no formal note of the suggested admission was made in the learned judge’s notes and it"
"is by no means clear […] that the trial judge correctly appreciated the position of the plaintiffs’"
"counsel  and  therefore,  the  principal  point  is  open  for  argument.”  Thus,  in  the  said  case,"
"although an erroneous admission on a point of law was permitted to be withdrawn, the learned"
"judge left the issue of withdrawal of an admission, whether it be a question of law or fact, open"
"for further discussion."
"A
nother land mark case, where withdrawal of admissions was discussed is, the case of"
"Solomon  Ranaweera  v.  Solomon  Singho  (supra),  wherein  Sharvananda,  J.,  observed,  in  a"
"partition action “an admission made by counsel for one of the parties that such a decree was"
"null and void for failure to make proper substitution, is a mistaken admission in law and is not"
"binding on such party.”"
"T
he aforesaid case relates to an interlocutory appeal stemming from a partition action"
"which had been remitted to the trial court for re-trial. It is interesting to note that the learned"
"counsel  for  the  plaintiff-respondent,  Mr.  Thiagalingam  Q.C.  admitted  that  he  over  looked"
"Section  651  (1)  of  the  Administration  of  Justice  (Amendment)  Law  No  25  of  1975,  when"
"drafting  amended  plaint  in  a  partition  action  and  moved  to  withdraw  the  admission  in  the"
"Supreme Court [pertaining to a final decree being null and void in view of failure to make a"
"proper substitution] which was made on a mistaken view of the law. He was allowed to retract"
"such admission."
"I
n  my  view,  the  facts  relating  to  the  aforesaid  case,  are  unique  in  nature  and  the"
"observations of Sharvananda, J., cannot be applied in general to all cases.  In any  event, the"
"learned Queen’s Counsel was allowed to re-tract an admission based on a mistaken view of the"
"law and not an admission based on a question of fact, as is the issue in the impugned case."
"T
he case of Uvais v. Punyawathie (supra) a rent and ejectment matter, is another case"
"relied upon by parties before this Court. It relates to withdrawal of admissions. In this case,"
"Mark Fernando, J. considers a number of provisions in the Civil Procedure Code, pertaining to"
"conducting  of  a  civil  trial,  and  elucidates  the  legal  position  in  respect  of  ‘withdrawal  of"
"admissions’ in the following manner:"
