"establish  that  such  material  was  not  available  or  could  not  have  been  forseen  by  the  3rd"
"defendant at the time the evidence was led, and therefore, the court cannot be satisfied whether"
"such  material  was  actually  available  or  not,  in  order  to  use  its  discretion,  to  permit  the  3rd"
"defendant to lead such evidence."
"M
oreover, the learned trial judge referred to another factor, which in the opinion of the"
"judge was crucial, when the court decided to reject the application of the 3rd defendant. It was"
"the relationship between the 2nd and 3rd defendants, a contention that was put forward by the"
"counsel for the 3rd defendant in the written submissions, though not referred to in the petition"
"filed before court."
"T
he learned judge emphatically stated that the 3rd defendant ought to have known the"
"relationship between the 3rd defendant and the 2nd defendant, viz, whether the 2nd defendant"
"was in the employment of the 3rd defendant and or whether the 2nd defendant acted as an agent"
"of the 3rd defendant. If the 2nd defendant was not in employment or did not act in the capacity"
"of an agent, the judge observed, then the 3rd defendant at the relevant time and when the defence"
"was called, could have led evidence of such fact."
"T
he 3rd defendant failed to avail of such opportunity and did not lead evidence of such"
"fact at the given moment. Furthermore, the 3rd defendant failed to indicate to court, why she"
"failed to give evidence since the relationship of the 2nd and 3rd defendant is a matter, which is"
"within the personal knowledge of the 3rd defendant, and a fact that the 3rd defendant should"
"have known from the inception of the case. Hence, the learned judge, in his Order categorically"
"emphasized, the relationship between the 2nd and 3rd defendants is not fresh or new evidence,"
"that can be led under Section 166 of the Civil Procedure Code ‘as evidence of a decisive nature,"
"not reasonably foreseen’, as stated in Samarakone’s case referred to above."
"In the Order at  page 13, the  learned trial  judge  goes on to explore  another factor to"
"justify  its  findings  i.e.,  a  party  does  not  have  a  right  to  lead  evidence,  contrary  to  an"
"admission of fact recorded at the trial."
"I
n the instant matter, the 2nd and 3rd defendants have admitted the contents of paragraph"
"four of the amended plaint and recorded it as ‘an admission’ at the commencement of the trial."
"Paragraph four of the amended plaint, reads ‘that at the material time, i.e., 27th December, 1998"
"the 3rd defendant was the owner of the bus bearing number 62-9444, and the 2nd defendant was"
"the driver of the bus and drove the bus as an employee or as an agent of the 3rd defendant’."
"F
urthermore, the 3rd defendant, in the joint answer filed before the District Court [on"
"behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants] has categorically accepted such fact, namely, that the 2nd"
"defendant was in the employment of the 3rd defendant and drove the bus at the material time."
"Thus, the learned judge went onto hold, having accepted the fact that the 2nd defendant was in"
"the employment of the 3rd defendant in the answer, and recording it as an admission, the 3rd"
"defendant cannot resile from such fact."
