"A joint answer, for the driver and the owner was filed in court, in which the fact of the"
"accident, the ownership of the bus and the status of the driver at the material time, i.e., the 2nd"
"defendant  was  acting  in  the  capacity  of  an  employee,  agent  and  representative  of  the  3rd"
"defendant when the accident occurred, was categorically admitted by the 2nd and 3rd defendants."
"Moreover, such fact was recorded as an admission at the trial."
"F
urther it is observed, the issues raised on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants take up"
"the same stand and also shed light to the relationship of the 2nd and 3rd defendants. By issues"
"bearing numbers 15 and 16, the 2nd and 3rd defendants categorically put forward the point of"
"contention  that  the  accident  occurred  not  due  to  the  fault  or  negligence  of  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"defendants, but due to the negligence of the driver of the van in which the deceased and the"
"plaintiffs travelled."
"Having presented such a defence before the District Court in response to the case of the"
"plaintiffs,  it  is  beyond  comprehension  as  to  why  the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants,  who  were"
"throughout represented by the insurer, (although by different counsel) thought it fit to change"
"its stance and take up the position, that the 3rd defendant is not vicariously liable for the actions"
"of the 2nd defendant."
"F
urthermore,  this  Court  is  intrigued  by  the  fact  that  the  3rd  defendant  deemed  it"
"necessary to  put  forward an argument,  that the admissions recorded based on the pleadings"
"filed  had  been  entered  by  mistake  and  or  error,  after  conceding  to  court,  days  before  that"
"evidence will not be led on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants. In the submissions filed before"
"this Court, the 3rd defendant relied on Sarkar’s two books, ‘Code of Civil Procedure’ and ‘Law"
"of Evidence’ to substantiate, that a gratuitous or an erroneous admission can be withdrawn."
"I
n any event, the questions of law that this Court is called upon to answer are, whether"
"the learned judges of the High Court misdirected themselves by failing to take into account the"
"factors that must necessarily be considered in exercising the discretion vested in a trial court in"
"terms  of  Section  166  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code;  secondly,  whether  a  party  should  be"
"permitted to withdraw an admission of fact, already recorded, merely because a party thereafter"
"takes up the position that the admission of fact, was an error and was recorded by mistake; and"
"thirdly, whether in not  permitting the 3rd defendant  to  lead evidence afresh, the High Court"
"erred in law."
"I would begin my analysis of the aforesaid questions of law by referring to pages 849"
"and 850 of the book ‘The Law of Evidence’ by E R S R Coomaraswamy. It reads as follows;"
