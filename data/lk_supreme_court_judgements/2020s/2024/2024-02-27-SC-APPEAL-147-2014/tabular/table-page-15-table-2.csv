"course of trial prescribed in the rules contained in the earlier sections."
"The Supreme Court will not, as a rule, interfere with the exercise of the"
"discretion of the trial judge under this section…”"
"H
ence  it  is  observed,  the  discretion  to  allow  a  party  to  lead  fresh  evidence  is  more"
"readily granted after only one party has closed his case, than after both parties have done so;"
"and it would be difficult for a party to obtain such discretion, when the weaknesses in a case"
"have been exposed."
"I
n exercising the discretion, the court must preserve the balance between abstract justice"
"and the need for finality in litigation and should consider the reason why the evidence was not"
"led before; the materiality of the evidence; and the possible prejudice to the opposing party."
