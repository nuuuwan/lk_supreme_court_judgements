"The  writer  further  states,  quoting  Jaganadan  Pillai  v.  Perera  5  NLR  95  and"
"Samarakone  v.  The  Public  Trustee  (supra)  “that  the  Supreme  Court  will  not  as  a  rule,"
"interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge.”"
"There is no doubt, that Section 166 of the Civil Procedure Code, permits a trial court,"
"to depart from the prescribed course of trial, if in the opinion of court there is a ‘grave concern’."
"In the event such a departure is permitted, the reasons for such departure should be recorded"
"by the trial judge. Thus, first and foremost the court should be satisfied, that there was a ‘grave"
"concern,’ i.e., factors unforeseen for  a party  not  to  lead such evidence  at the material  time."
"Thereafter only the court could use its discretion and permit or disallow an application to depart"
"from the laid down course of trial."
"T
his Court observes, that the learned trial judge,  in the instant matter relying on the"
"pronouncements  of  Weerasooriya,  J.,  in  the  case  of  Samarakone  v.  The  Public  Trustee"
"(supra), emphasised that application of Section 166 should be when a party having closed his"
"case, is faced with evidence of a decisive nature arising ex-improviso, which he could not have"
"reasonably foreseen earlier."
"H
aving considered the application of the 3rd defendant to lead evidence on her behalf"
"and to further cross-examine the 1st plaintiff, the learned judge, being satisfied that there was"
"no  ‘grave  concern’,  declined  the  discretion  vested  in  court,  to  permit  a  departure  from  the"
"prescribed course of trial. In my view, the said reasoning of the learned trial judge cannot be"
"faulted."
"T
he appellant  in  the written submissions, took up the position, that the Order of the"
"High Court is  erroneous, since the  High Court failed to  consider, that the aforesaid  case  of"
"Samarakone  v.  The  Public  Trustee  as  well  as  the  case  of  Murin  Perera  v.  Gajaweera"
"(supra) [cited by the trial judge] can be distinguished. The contention of the appellant was, that"
"in the said two cases, no application was made to have recourse to Section 166 before the trial"
"court and hence, the pronouncements made in the said two cases have no bearing and cannot"
"be relied upon in the instant appeal."
"I
n my view, the aforesaid contention of the appellant has no merit since the material"
"factor is the effect of such provision and not the point at which recourse to Section 166 was"
"made, be it at the trial or in appeal. The crucial issue is, what is the evidence to be led afresh"
"or  anew;  was  it  foreseeable?  was  such  evidence  available  to  such  party;  and  whether  such"
"material was within the knowledge of the party, who is belatedly making an application to lead"
"such evidence."
"T
he appellant in his written submissions also contended that the discretion of the court"
"should extend to permit evidence not led and even inadvertently omitted to be led by a party at"
"the relevant time, since it is ‘mere inadvertence’. The appellant went onto submit relying on"
"Law  of  Evidence  by  E  R  S  R  Coomaraswamy,  that  evidence  inadvertently  omitted  is"
"permitted to be led afresh in South Africa. The said argument of the appellant too, in my view"
