"erred in law."
"I would begin my analysis of the aforesaid questions of law by referring to pages 849"
"and 850 of the book ‘The Law of Evidence’ by E R S R Coomaraswamy. It reads as follows;"
"“Late Evidence Generally"
"Civil cases"
"A trial court has a general discretion to allow a party who has closed his"
"case  to  lead  fresh  evidence  at  any  time  up  to  the  judgement.  This"
"discretion is well-recognized in South Africa. Such leave will be more"
"readily granted after only one party has closed his case than after both"
