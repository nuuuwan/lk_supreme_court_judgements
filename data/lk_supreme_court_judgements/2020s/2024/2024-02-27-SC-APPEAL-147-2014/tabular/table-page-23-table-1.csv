"H
aving put forward the contention relating to ‘no prejudice’, the appellant goes on to"
"state  that  ‘in  the  interests  of  justice’,  the  appellant’s  application  should  be  permitted.  The"
"appellant drew our attention to two cases, namely, De Fonseka v. Dharmawardena [1994] 3"
"SLR 49 to emphasise that Section 839 recognizes the inherent power of court to make an order,"
"as may be necessary, for ends of justice; and Velupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District"
"Council 39 NLR 464 to emphasise that this is a court of justice and not an academy of law."
"W
e have considered the above submissions of the appellant, and we see no reason to"
"rely on Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code, viz the inherent power of court, in the instant"
"matter, to permit the appellant to lead evidence, ‘in the interests of justice’."
"T
here is no doubt that the ‘injury’ the appellant is complaining of, was the appellant’s"
"own  doing.  The  appellant  would  have  we  assume,  opted  not  to  give  evidence  nor  to  lead"
"evidence on her behalf and not to put up a defence to negate or challenge the action filed, after"
"a careful consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances."
"H
aving taken such a stand, a reasonable person should stand by its decision. He cannot"
"resile from such position. In a court of law, a party cannot approbate and reprobate. Moreover,"
"a party cannot be permitted to materially change the composition of its defence. A party should"
"not  take  the  other  party  by  surprise  nor  take  undue  advantage  of  a  situation.  Rule  of  Law"
"demands that justice and fair play should prevail."
"S
imilarly, a party cannot be allowed to prolong a case and hamper the administration"
"of justice. Already a decade and a half had passed and the trial court has still not delivered"
"judgement of its findings, although the trial had been concluded."
"T
he Civil Procedure Code, provide the manner in  which a case has  to  be presented,"
"defended  and  adjudicated.  Section  166  categorically  provides,  that  a  court  may,  for  ‘grave"
"cause’, permit a departure from the course of trial, prescribed in the rules of the Code."
"W
hen a trial court has decided that a departure cannot be permitted under Section 166,"
"I see no reason as to why a party should move court under Section 839 of the Code, to make"
"an order, ‘in the interests of justice.’"
"I
n  the  instant  appeal  the  learned  trial  judge,  having  considered  all  relevant  matters"
"decided that a departure from the course of trial is not required and should not be permitted."
"Thus,  the  application  of  the  3rd  defendant  to  lead  evidence  was  refused  and  rejected.  The"
"learned judges of the High Court upheld such decision for reasons stated."
"I
n such circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with such decision. The appellant"
"has failed to convince this Court, that the learned judges of the High Court have erred in law"
"or misdirected themselves in coming to such a finding. Hence, I answer the 3rd question of law"
"in the negative."
