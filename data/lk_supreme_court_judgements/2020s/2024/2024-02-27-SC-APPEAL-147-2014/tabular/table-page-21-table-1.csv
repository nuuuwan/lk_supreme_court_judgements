"I
n the instant appeal, the 3rd defendant moved to withdraw the admission after the trial"
"was concluded, and the case was called for the third occasion to tender written submissions."
"The admission to be withdrawn related to the relationship between the 2nd and 3rd defendants."
"In my view, it is an admission of fact and not a question of law. In any event, the 3rd defendant"
"cannot propound a theory that it was untrue or made by mistake or error after categorically"
"accepting the relationship in its pleadings, admissions and issues."
"T
he District Court rightly rejected such request and the High Court upheld the Order of"
"the District Court."
"I
n the said circumstances, I am of the view that the High Court acted correctly and in"
"accordance with the law. Thus, the appellant has failed to convince this Court, that the learned"
"judges of the High Court have erred or misdirected themselves in coming to such conclusion."
"Therefore, I answer the 2nd question of law raised before this Court in the negative."
"T
he final matter that the Court is called upon to answer, is whether the appellant should"
"be permitted to lead evidence."
"U
ndisputedly, the 3rd defendant /appellant opted not to lead evidence nor put forward a"
"defence at the trial. Generally, in a trial, it would have been vital to have had the evidence of"
"the 3rd defendant led, since the 3rd defendant was the principal defendant before court and also"
"to negate the case of the plaintiff filed against the 3rd defendant and others. Nevertheless, the"
"3rd defendant thought otherwise."
"A
s discussed in this judgement in detail, the appellant having failed to put forward a"
"defence and or lead evidence at the material time made an application to lead the evidence of"
"the  3rd  defendant  and  further  cross-examine  the  1st  plaintiff.  The  trial  court  rejected  such"
"application. Being aggrieved by the Order of the District Court, the appellant went before the"
"High Court. In the High Court, the appellant abandoned the relief to further cross-examine the"
"1st plaintiff and only sought to lead her evidence. The said application was rejected by the High"
"Court with costs."
"N
ow, once again before this Court, the appellant is moving for the very same relief by"
"way of the 3rd question of law. In my view, the 1st and 2nd questions of law have a direct bearing"
"on this matter. The 3rd question is a follow up question. Thus, stemming from the answers given"
"to the 1st and 2nd questions, this question too should be answered in the negative."
"N
evertheless, the appellant fashions her submissions on the basis of Section 839 of the"
"Civil Procedure Code and contends that the court is vested with inherent power to make order"
"‘in the interests of justice’."
"T
o  substantiate  the  said  argument,  the  appellant  relies  on  Seneviratne  v.  Fonseka"
"Abeykoon (1986)1 CALR 434 also reported in [1986] 2 SLR 1 and submits that in the said"
