"T
he  appellant  in  written  submissions  filed  before  this  Court,  put  forward  another"
"argument, based on Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance as well as upon the cases of Perera"
"v. Samarakoon and Solomon Ranaweera v. Solomon Singho (supra), that an admission of"
"fact  which  is  untrue  or  made  by  mistake  or  error  can  be  withdrawn.  The  appellant  further"
"distinguished the Mariammi’s case and Uvais’s case as not relevant to the facts of the instant"
"case, upon the ground that in the said two cases the withdrawal of the admission of fact was"
"moved for the first time in appeal, and not before the trial court."
"T
he said submission of the appellant, in my view, has no merit and should be rejected."
"As  clearly  outlined  in  Uvais’s  case  decided  in  1991,  permitting  an  admission  of  fact  to  be"
"withdrawn,  would  subvert  the  guiding  principles  laid  down  in  the  Civil  Procedure  Code."
"Moreover, it would transform the case to a different position not pleaded, nor suggested to in"
"cross-examination and not supported by the evidence of the witnesses."
"F
urthermore, the aforesaid principles laid down in Uvais case, have been referred to"
"and followed in many judgements of the appellate courts. In Jayalath v. Karunatilake [2013]"
"1 SLR 337 the Court of Appeal re-echoed that, while it is sometimes permissible to withdraw"
"admissions on questions of law, admissions on questions of fact cannot be withdrawn. See also"
"Soysa v. Fernando and others [2012] 1 SLR 182."
"T
he recent judgement of this Court in Chaminda v. Janashakthi General Insurance"
"Ltd., - S.C.Appeal 134/2018- decided on 09-10-2019 re-iterated the principles laid down in"
"Mariammai’s case and Uvais’s case."
"T
he  facts  of  the  aforesaid  Chaminda  v.  Janashakthi  case  is  similar  to  the  instant"
"matter. It refers to a comprehensive insurance policy issued to a party pertaining to a vehicle."
"The vehicle met with an accident and extensive damage was caused to it. A claim was made"
"and  the  insurer  repudiated  the  claim.  When  the  matter  went  into  trial,  an  admission  was"
"recorded regarding the jurisdiction of the court. Thereafter the defendant insurance company,"
"moved to withdraw the said admission relating to jurisdiction."
"A
marasekara, J., in his judgement referred to Uvais’s case and other authorities, and"
"held that the admission of jurisdiction by the defendant, was an admission of fact and not a"
"question of law and as such the defendant cannot withdraw an admission of fact at a belated"
"stage."
"I
 am in agreement with the judicial dicta of the aforesaid Uvais’s case and Chaminda’s"
"case. I re-iterate that the time tested principles laid down in the Civil Procedure Code, and more"
"so, in Sections 75, 146(2), 148 and explanation (2) of Section 150, should be strictly followed"
"and rigidly enforced. A party cannot be permitted to withdraw an admission belatedly and at"
"its  whim  and  fancy.  An  admission  once  recorded  by  all  parties  with  consent,  cannot  be"
"permitted to be withdrawn, arbitrarily by a party, many years after it was recorded, whether it"
"is true or untrue and or made by mistake or error or not."
