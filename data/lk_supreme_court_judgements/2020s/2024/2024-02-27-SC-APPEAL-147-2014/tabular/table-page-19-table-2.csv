"Appeal  was in  error in  holding that the defendant  could  withdraw admissions  recorded at  a"
"trial."

"of fact’, whereas in certain circumstances an ‘admission of a question of law’ may be permitted."
"S

"instructions of the party concerned."

"admission by the defendant pertaining to increase of rent creating a new tenancy agreement,"
"the plaintiff may have changed its strategy. Further, His Lordship succinctly opined, in any"
"event withdrawal of an admission will go against the gravamen of the fundamental principles"
"of the Civil Procedure Code in regard to pleadings and issues and the whole concept of a civil"
"trial  encapsulated  by  Sections  75,  146(2),  148  and  explanation  (2)  of  Section  150  would"
"become superfluous."
