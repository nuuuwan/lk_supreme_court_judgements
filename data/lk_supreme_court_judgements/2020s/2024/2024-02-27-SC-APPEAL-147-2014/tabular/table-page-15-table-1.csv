"have done so. It would be even more difficult for a party to obtain leave"
"after the weaknesses in his case have exposed in argument or judgement"
"has been reserved."
"In  exercising  this  discretion,  the  court  must  seek  to  preserve  a"
"balance between abstract justice and the need for finality in litigation."
"The following factors would be considered."
"(
a)  The reasons why the evidence was not led before: Leave will not"
"generally  be  granted,  unless  the  evidence  could  not  by  the"
"exercise of due diligence have been led at the proper time. If the"
"evidence  is  at  the  disposal  of  a  party,  who  does  not  lead  it,"
"because he considers it unnecessary, he cannot reinforce his case"
"by leading it later. More recent decisions in South Africa have"
"taken a more liberal view and permitted evidence omitted earlier"
"through mere inadvertence, or by considering it unnecessary on"
"a bona fide mistake of law."
"(
b) The materiality of the evidence and whether it is likely to have"
"any effect on the result of the case."
"(c)  The possible prejudice to the opposing party, as where he may"
"no  longer  have  available  the  witnesses  who  could  have  given"
"evidence in rebuttal. If the opposing party is unlikely to suffer"
"any  prejudice,  which  cannot  be  compensated  by  an  award  of"
"costs, leave may be granted. This would also be the case where"
"the  plaintiff  seeks  to  lead  further  evidence  when  only  he  has"
"closed his case."
"In Sri Lanka, the same general discretion is recognised by section"
"166 of the Civil Procedure Code, which provides that the court may, for"
"grave cause, to be recorded by it at the time, permit a departure from the"
"course of trial prescribed in the rules contained in the earlier sections."
"The Supreme Court will not, as a rule, interfere with the exercise of the"
"discretion of the trial judge under this section…”"
