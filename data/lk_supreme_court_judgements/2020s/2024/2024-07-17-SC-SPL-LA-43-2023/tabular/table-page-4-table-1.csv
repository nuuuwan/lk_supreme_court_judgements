"Statement denying the charges and taking up the position that he was assaulted by"
"the Police Officers who had then taken him to the Police Station."
"I
n the course of the Judgment, the Trial Judge had taken the view that the defence"
"taken  up  by  the  Accused  in  the  Dock  Statement  has  not  been  suggested  to  the"
"witnesses in the course of cross examination.  However, the Court of Appeal had not"
"agreed with that position.  The learned Deputy Solicitor General also submitted before"

"evaluating the Dock Statement made by the Accused, particularly in the light of the"
"nature of the defence taken in the Dock Statement by the Accused in the instant case,"
"would vitiate the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal that the Dock Statement"

"also vitiate the final conclusion of this case arrived at by the Court of Appeal to dismiss"
"the Appeal before it."
"I
n our view this is sufficient for us to decide not to allow the Judgment dated 10-01-"
"2023, pronounced by the Court of Appeal to stand."
"A
s regards the Judgment of the High Court, the reason for the rejection of the Dock"
"Statement of the Accused has been adverted to earlier in this Judgment.  For those"
