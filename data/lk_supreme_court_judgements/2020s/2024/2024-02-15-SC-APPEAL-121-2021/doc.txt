Obeyesekere, J

This is an appeal against a judgment of the Provincial High Court of the Uva Province

holden at Badulla [the High Court] delivered on 19th February 2020 by which the High

Court affirmed the decision of the District Court of Mahiyanganaya to reject the petition

filed by the Petitioner Appellant Appellant [the Petitioner] in terms of Section 14A of

the Civil Procedure Code on the basis that the affidavit attached to the said petition is not

in accordance with the law.

On 3rd December 2021, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following question of

law:

Have the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court failed to consider that the

learned District Judge erred in dismissing the application of the Petitioner, when the

Petitioner has filed a valid petition and affidavit which was duly executed before a

Justice of the Peace in that the deponent of the said affidavit by opening paragraph

as well as jurat of the said affidavit has sworn to the contents therein before a Justice

of the Peace?

Background facts

The Petitioner is a licensed commercial bank. Pursuant to an application made to its

Mahiyanganaya Branch by Nayanananda Deshapriya Attanayake [the Borrower] and his

wife, the 1st Respondent Respondent Respondent [the 1st Respondent], the Petitioner,

the Borrower and the 1st Respondent had entered into an agreement on 21st June 2010

in terms of which inter alia:

(a) the Petitioner had agreed to grant the Borrower a sum of Rs. 1,300,000 by way of a

Shanthi housing loan to complete the ground floor of a building situated on a land

belonging to the Borrower;

(b) the Borrower had agreed to repay the said sum of money together with interest in

120 equated monthly instalments;

5

(c) the Borrower had agreed to mortgage to the Petitioner the property on which the

above building was situated as security for the said loan;

(d) the Borrower was required to tender a Mortgage Protection Policy to secure the

payment of the monthly instalments in the event of his death or him becoming

permanently disabled prior to the repayment of the loan.

Accordingly, (a) by Mortgage Bond No. 2034 executed on 16th June 2010, the Borrower

had mortgaged the said land to the Petitioner; (b) the Borrower had submitted a

Mortgage Protection Policy from HNB Assurance Limited [the Insurer]; and (c) the said

loan had been disbursed to the current account of the Borrower in three instalments.

The Borrower had passed away on 18th January 2011, with the cause of death being

declared as cardio respiratory failure and end stage renal failure. Upon the Insurer, an

associate company of the Petitioner, declining to pay in terms of the aforementioned

Mortgage Protection Policy, and in the absence of a testamentary case being filed in

respect of the estate of the Borrower which would have enabled the Petitioner to make

a claim in respect of the monies lent and advanced to the Borrower, the Petitioner had

sent a letter of demand dated 21st May 2015 to the 1st Respondent and to the 2nd 4th

Respondents Respondents Respondents who are the three children of the Borrower

and the 1st Respondent [collectively referred to as the Respondents], demanding the

payment of a sum of Rs. 1,966,733.67, being the capital outstanding of the

aforementioned loan and interest thereon as at 31st March 2015. It is admitted that the

Respondents have not paid the sum so demanded.

Application under Section 14A

In terms of Section 14A(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, Where a person against whom

the right to any relief is alleged to exist is dead and the right to sue for such relief survives,

the person in whom such right is alleged to exist, may make an application by way of

summary procedure supported by affidavit to the court in which an action for the same

may be instituted in the manner set out in paragraphs (a) or (b) of the said sub-section,

seeking permission of Court to substitute in place of the deceased the person whom the

6

petitioner desires to be made the defendant in the proposed action. The procedure that

should be followed by Court in dealing with such an application has been set out in Section

14A(2) (5).

The Petitioner, acting in terms of Section 14A(1), filed a petition in the District Court of

Mahiyanganaya on 10th August 2015 pleading the above matters and claiming that even

though the Borrower has passed away, the right to sue to recover the said sum of money

has survived, and therefore seeking an order of Court to permit the 1st Respondent to be

named as the defendant in an action that the Petitioner intends filing in terms of the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1990, as amended. The said petition had been

supported by an affidavit of Anton Jude Trevor Fernando, a Senior Manager of the

Petitioner, who, being a Christian, had deposed to the facts contained in the petition. It is

the alleged infirmities in the said affidavit that has culminated in this appeal.

Objections to the application

In her Statement of Objections, the 1st Respondent had pleaded that in terms of the

aforementioned Mortgage Protection Policy, upon the death of the insured i.e., the

Borrower the Insurer became liable to make the payments due from the Borrower to

the Petitioner and that if the Insurer has repudiated liability, it is the responsibility of the

Petitioner to take legal action against the Insurer, instead of pursuing legal action against

the 1st Respondent. She had also disclosed that Case No. M/272 has been filed by her in

the District Court of Mahiyanganaya against the Petitioner and the Insurer, seeking to

enforce the terms of the said Mortgage Protection Policy, and stated that as the liability

of the Insurer is the subject matter in Case No. M/272, it is futile to institute another

action in respect of the same subject matter. The response of the Petitioner was that the

claim of the Petitioner may be prescribed if it is to await the outcome of the said action.

It must be noted that neither party has tendered to the District Court copies of the

pleadings filed in the said case nor taken steps to apprise this Court of the present status

of the said case.

7

Although not pleaded in the said Statement of Objections, the 1st Respondent had claimed

in the written submissions that were tendered at the Inquiry held to consider the

application of the Petitioner that the affidavit annexed to the petition is defective for the

following reasons:

a) The jurat does not contain the name of the person making the affidavit;

b) It does not appear that the signature of the deponent has been placed before the

Justice of the Peace;

c) The jurat does not reveal that the contents of the affidavit were read over to the

deponent by the Justice of the Peace.

While I shall refer to in detail to the Order of the District Court and the Judgment of the

High Court later in this judgment, it would suffice to state at this stage that the District

Court had upheld the objections in paragraphs (b) and (c) above, and that the High Court,

while affirming the said Order, had proceeded to reject the affidavit on grounds not

referred to by the District Court.

Applicable legal provisions

In Kumarasinghe v Ratnakumara and Others [(1983) 2 Sri LR 393] Sharvananda, A.C.J.,

(as he then was) has observed that an Affidavit in support of the application thus serves

the purpose of proof of facts stated therein. It furnishes the evidence verifying the

allegation of facts contained in the petition. Affidavit evidence carries equal sanctity as

oral evidence. It has further been observed in Kumarasiri and Another v Rajapakse

[(2006) 1 Sri LR 359] that it is the flesh and blood of the affidavit which gives life to the

skeleton in the petition. In the absence of a valid affidavit supporting the averments in the

petition, the petition becomes a nullity. Thus, it is important that an affidavit is prepared

in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws.

There are two laws that I must consider in determining the aforementioned question of

law. The first is the Civil Procedure Code [the Code] and the second is the Oaths and

Affirmations Ordinance [the Ordinance].

8

The starting point is Section 181 of the Code which provides that, Affidavits shall be

confined to the statement of such facts as the declarant is able of his own knowledge and

observation to testify to, except on interlocutory applications in which statement of his

belief may be admitted, provided that reasonable grounds for such belief be set forth in

the affidavit.

Section 183A(b) provides that:

Where any person is required under the provisions of this Code, or under any other

law for the time being in force, to make an affidavit, then-

(b) where the action is brought by or against a corporation, board, public body, or

company, any secretary, director or other principal officer of such corporation,

board, public body or company;

may make an affidavit in respect of these matters, instead of the party to the action:

Provided that in each of the foregoing cases the person who makes the affidavit

instead of the party to the action, must be a person having personal knowledge of

the facts of the cause of action, and must in his affidavit swear or affirm that he

deposes from his own personal knowledge of the matter therein contained and shall

be liable to be examined as to the subject-matter thereof at the discretion of the

Judge, as the party to the action would have been, if the affidavit had been made by

such party. [emphasis added]

In terms of Section 437 of the Code, Whenever any order has been made by any court

for the taking of evidence on affidavit, or whenever evidence on affidavit is required for

production in any application or action of summary procedure, whether already instituted

or about to be instituted, an affidavit or written statement of facts conforming to the

provisions of section 181 may be sworn or affirmed to by the person professing to make

the statement embodied in the affidavit before any court or Justice of the Peace or

Commissioner for Oaths, or in the case of an affidavit sworn or affirmed in a country

outside Sri Lanka, before any person qualified to administer oath or affirmation according

9

to the law of that country, and the fact that the affidavit bears on its face the name of the

court, the number of the action and the names of the parties shall be sufficient authority

to such court or Justice of the Peace, or Commissioner for oaths or such person qualified

to administer the oath or affirmation. [emphasis added]

Section 183(c) provides further that, In the case of any affidavit under this Chapter,

any person qualified to administer an Oath or affirmation according to the law of the

country, in which the affidavit is sworn or affirmed, may administer the oath to the

declarant.

In terms of Section 438, Every affidavit made in accordance with the preceding

provisions shall be signed by the declarant in the presence of the court, Justice of the

Peace or Commissioner for Oaths, or person qualified before whom it is sworn or

affirmed. [emphasis added]

Form 75 of the Code sets out what is referred to as the Formal parts of an affidavit in an

Action and is re-produced below:

In the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka.

(or) In the District / Primary Court of Colombo (or as the case may be).

(Title.)

I, A. B. (full name and description of deponent, and if a married woman, full name

and description of her husband), of (place of residence) (and if a party, say so, and in

what capacity), being a Buddhist (or being a Hindu or being a Muslim etc., as the

case may he, or having a conscientious objection to making an oath) solemnly,

sincerely, and truly affirm and declare (or if the deponent is a Christian, make oath

and say) as follows :-

Affirmed (or Sworn), [or if there are more than one deponent, Affirmed (or Sworn)

by the deponents A. B.] at.............this...............day of....... 19.......

Before me (name and office of person administering the affirmation or oath)

10

In terms of the above Form, (a) a Christian shall make an oath at the beginning of the

affidavit; (b) it is only thereafter that the facts contained in the affidavit shall be stated;

(c) the jurat shall specify that the declarant swore in the presence of the Justice of the

Peace; (d) a Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim shall, instead of an oath, solemnly, sincerely and

truly affirm to the facts in the affidavit and (e) the jurat shall confirm such fact of

affirmation.

While Section 4 of the Ordinance requires a witness to take an oath, the requirement that

a Buddhist, Muslim or a Hindu shall affirm instead of taking an oath is specified in Section

5 of the Ordinance, which is re-produced below:

Where the person required by law to make an oath-

(a) is a Buddhist, Hindu, or Muslim, or of some other religion according to which

oaths are not of binding force; or

(b) has a conscientious objection to make an oath,

he may, instead of making an oath, make an affirmation.

In M. Tudor Danister Anthony Fernando v Rankiri Hettiarachchige Freddie Perera

[SC/HCCA/LA/Case No. 279/2012; SC minutes of 17th December 2014] Priyantha

Jayawardena, PC, J, having referred to the provisions of the Oaths and Affirmations

Ordinance No. 6 of 1841 which was replaced by the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance

No. 3 of 1842 and which in turn was replaced by the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance

No. 9 of 1895 which is currently in force, stated that, A comparison of the law relating to

affidavits in Sri Lanka shows that the legislature has been conscious of the fact that Sri

Lanka has a multi - racial and a multi - religious population and amended the law relating

to oaths and affirmations to suit the requirements of the society. Therefore, it is necessary

to be conscious of the said fact in interpreting the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance.

11

In Sooriya Enterprises (International) Limited v Michael White & Company Limited

[(2002) 3 Sri LR 371] Mark Fernando, J referred with approval to the following passage

from Rustomjee v Khan [18 NLR 120] where Pereira, J. (de Sampayo, J. agreeing) stated

as follows:

"While the old Ordinance No. 3 of 1842, made it compulsory on witnesses who were

non-Christians to make affirmations, the new Ordinance (the Oaths Ordinance,

1895) made it optional with them to do so. The primary provision of the new

Ordinance is that all witnesses shall make oaths. It then enacts that a witness who,

being a non-Christian, is a Buddhist, Hindu or Muhammadan, or of some other

religion according to which oaths are not of binding force, "may", instead of making

an oath, make an affirmation. To swear is no more than to assert, calling God to

witness, or invoking His help to the deponent in the matter in connection with which

the oath is taken, and it is open to any person, be he Hindu, Muhammadan or

Zoroastrian, who believes in God, to claim to be sworn (rather than to affirm) ..."

Fernando, J went on to state as follows:

This view that "may" in section 5 is permissive, rather than mandatory, is supported

by sections 7 and 9 of the Ordinance, which manifest a legislative intention to allow

a witness or a deponent some choice as to whether he will swear or affirm; so much

so that the substitution of an oath for an affirmation (or vice versa) will not invalidate

proceedings or shut out evidence. The fundamental obligation of a witness or

deponent is to tell the truth (section 10), and the purpose of an oath or affirmation

is to reinforce that obligation.

The ratio decidendi of Rustomjee v. Khan that section 5 gave an option "to any

person, be he Hindu, Muhammadan or Zoroastrian, who believes in God, to claim to

be sworn (rather than to affirm)", has not been doubted for 80 years. The Oaths

Ordinance was twice amended thereafter: in 1915, and again in 1954 when section

5 (a) was amended. If the judicial interpretation of section 5 was erroneous, the

legislature had the opportunity to correct it. [emphasis added]

12

In terms of Section 12 (3) of the Ordinance, "Every Commissioner before whom any oath

or affirmation is administered, or before whom any affidavit is taken under this

Ordinance, shall state truly in the jurat or attestation at what place and on what date the

same was administered or taken, and shall initial all alterations, erasures, and

interlineations appearing on the face thereof and made before the same was so

administered or taken" [emphasis added]

What Section 12(3) requires to be stated in the jurat is the place and date on which the

oath or affirmation was administered, which implicitly means that the jurat must specify

that an oath or affirmation was administered to the declarant prior to such declarant

stating the facts. It must be stated that there is no requirement for a further oath or

affirmation to be administered once the facts have been stated and prior to the declarant

placing his signature.

It would perhaps be important to refer to Section 9 of the Ordinance, in terms of which,

No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation, no substitution of any one for any

other of them, and no irregularity whatever in the form in which any one of them is

administered, shall invalidate any proceeding or render inadmissible any evidence

whatever in or in respect of which such omission, substitution, or irregularity took place,

or shall affect the obligation of a witness to state the truth.

The above provisions could therefore be summarised as follows:

(1) Where an affidavit is required to be made under the provisions of the Code, and

where the action is brought by a company such as a bank, the affidavit must be made

by the secretary, director or other principal officer of such company;

(2) The person who makes the affidavit must be a person having personal knowledge

of the facts of the cause of action, and must swear or affirm (as the case may be)

that the matters contained in the affidavit are within his own personal knowledge;

(3) A Christian must take an oath prior to stating the matters contained in the affidavit,

unless he or she has a conscientious objection to taking an oath, in which event such

fact shall be stated in the affidavit;

13

(4) A Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim shall, having stated so, and prior to narrating the facts

contained therein, solemnly and sincerely affirm to the truthfulness of such facts;

(5) Such oath or affirmation shall be taken before a Justice of the Peace or a

Commissioner for Oaths [collectively referred to as Justice of the Peace];

(6) The affidavit shall be signed by the declarant in the presence of the Justice of the

Peace before whom the oath or affirmation is made;

(7) The jurat shall state the time and the place at which the affidavit was sworn or

affirmed to;

(8) The Justice of the Peace shall thereafter cancel the stamp and place his signature

and seal on the affidavit in the presence of the declarant.

The requirement that, prior to the declarant signing the affidavit before the Justice of the

Peace, the contents of the affidavit must be read over to the declarant or that the

declarant must read the contents of the affidavit or that the contents of the affidavit be

explained to the declarant, are requirements that seek to ensure that the declarant has

understood the contents of the affidavit, and is implied by the provisions of Section 12(3).

The affidavit annexed to the petition

The declarant in the impugned affidavit is Anton Jude Trevor Fernando, a Senior Manager

of the Petitioner.

The said affidavit, which contains sixteen paragraphs, starts as follows:

fld<T 10" gS'ns' Phd udjf;a wxl 479 orK ia:dkfha wekagka PQvs fg%jra m%kdkaoq jk uu

wkqj my; i|yka mrsos m%ldY lsrSug ud yg n,h mjrd we;s nj uu m%ldY lrus'

Paragraphs 3 -16 supports the averments of fact in paragraphs 1-14 of the petition.

Paragraph 16 is followed by the jurat, which reads as follows:

by; kus i|yka osjqreus m%ldY jsiska lshjd & f;areusf.k osjqreus os jraI 2015 la jq Pqks ui 18 &

jk osk fld<T os w;aika ;nk ,oS &

Mr. Priyantha Alagiyawanna, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner did concede that the

word, m%ldY in the jurat should have read as m%ldYl, but stated it is only a typographical

error and does not in any manner affect the sanctity that should be attached to such

affidavit.

The signature of Trevor Fernando has been placed thereafter, followed by the statement

that the signature was placed before the Justice of the Peace [ud bosrsmsgoSh], followed by

the signature of the Justice of the Peace, the cancellation of the stamp and the affixing of

the seal of the Justice of the Peace.

While there is no dispute that the impugned affidavit has been affirmed by a principal

officer of the Petitioner who had personal knowledge of the facts contained therein, Mr.

Alagiyawanna pointed out that:

(a) prior to stating the matters contained in the affidavit, Trevor Fernando has sworn

to the truthfulness of what he is going to state, by taking an oath;

(b) the fact that he took an oath is borne out by the jurat, as well;

(c) the fact that the contents of the affidavit were read over and understood by Trevor

Fernando is borne out by the jurat;

15

(d) the fact that he has understood the contents of the affidavit is borne out by the

jurat;

(e) the deponent has placed his signature before the Justice of the Peace;

(f) the Justice of the Peace has placed his signature below the signature of the

deponent and the stamp.

It was therefore his position that the affidavit is compliant with the provisions of the law,

and that the District Court as well as the High Court erred in law when it rejected the

affidavit of Trevor Fernando.

Orders of the District Court and the High Court

On the face of it, the submission of Mr. Alagiyawanna appears to be correct, giving rise to

the question as to why the District Court and the High Court held otherwise.

In the order delivered on 9th June 2017, the learned District Judge had stated as follows:

osjqreus wd{d mk; m%ldrj fm;aiuslrejka jsiska bosrsm;a lr we;s osjqreus m%ldYh i,ld ne,sfusoS osjqreus m%ldYfha osjqreu lr we;af;a ld jsiskao hkak meyeos,sj olajd fkdue;' tfukau tlS osjqreu lr we;af;a iudodk jsksYaph ldrjrfhl+ bosrsmsgoS hkak iy;sl lr

Having considered the judgments in Ratwatte v Sumathipala [(2001) 2 Sri LR 55],

Kumarasiri and Another v Rajapakse [supra], Navaratne v Wadugodapitiya and Others

[(2006) 1 Sri LR 275] and Umma Anina v Jawahar [(2004) 2 Sri LR 1], the learned District

Judge had concluded as follows:

16

Aggrieved by the Order of the District Court rejecting its petition, the Petitioner had

lodged an appeal in the High Court. By its judgment delivered on 19th February 2020, the

High Court had affirmed the findings of the District Court for the following reasons:

osjqreus m%ldYhla f,i i,ld ne,sh fkdyel'

The above reasoning of the District Court and the High Court can be summarized as

follows:

(a) The affidavit has not been sworn before a Justice of the Peace;

(b) The deponent has not stated anywhere in the affidavit that the facts contained

therein are true;

(c) It is not clear if the contents of the affidavit have been read over to the deponent or

whether the deponent read the contents himself.

17

Has the affidavit been sworn before a Justice of the Peace? An allegation that is made time and again with regard to the validity of an affidavit is that

(a) the declarant was never present before the Justice of the Peace; or (b) the affidavit

was never read over to the declarant or by the declarant; or (c) the declarant did not sign

the affidavit in the presence of the Justice of the Peace, and thus, the entire affidavit is a

sham and lacks the sanctity that must be attached to an affidavit for a Court of Law to act

upon it as evidence of the matters contained in the pleadings. What gives rise to such

allegations are the multitude of errors committed in preparing an affidavit especially in

the jurat of an affidavit, and with regard to the religion of the declarant and the oath or

affirmation that is said to have been administered prior to stating the facts in an affidavit,

with the argument being that such errors could not have either occurred or else gone

unnoticed had both parties been present at the same time.

This Court has on numerous occasions stated that it is the responsibility of the Justice of

the Peace who represents to the entire world that the declarant swore or affirmed to the

truthfulness of the contents of such affidavit and placed his or her signature before him

and that it is safe to act on the contents of such affidavit, to ensure that it is in fact so.

I would like to briefly consider the four judgments that the District Court has considered

in order to ascertain if the District Court erred when it relied on such judgments. The first

is Ratwatte v Sumathipala [supra], where in the affidavit filed along with the petition the

declarant had stated that he is a Christian and made oath, but in the jurat it had been

stated that the contents were "Read over and explained to the deponent and the

deponent having understood the contents thereof affirmed thereto in my presence in

Colombo on this 19th day of June 1999". [emphasis added]

The Court held that:

If the contents of the affidavit were read and explained by the Justice of the Peace

I cannot fathom how he could have, after having read that the deponent was a

Christian and was making oath, at the end in the jurat clause could have stated that

the deponent affirmed.

18

I therefore hold that the Justice of the Peace did not read and explain to the deponent

the contents of the affidavit as he claims he did in the jurat clause, nor did the

deponent make oath and swear to the contents of the affidavit in the presence of

the Justice of the Peace, but that the Justice of the Peace blindly signed an

affidavit which had been already signed by the deponent in some other place at

some other time, without even entering the date.

A similar situation arose in Jeganathan v Safyath [(2003) 2 Sri LR 372] where the Court of

Appeal, while observing that, In a case of this nature where the plaintiff has commenced

her affidavit after making an oath does not end the jurat in a manner consistent with the

oath she has taken at the commencement it cannot be said that she has sworn to the

contents of the affidavit in the true sense of the expression as expected by law., held that,

Therefore a doubt arises, as to whether in fact the contents of the affidavit were read

over and explained to the plaintiff, by the Commissioner of Oath before the plaintiff placed

her signature.

An issue similar to that in Ratwatte v Sumathipala [supra] arose in M. Tudor Danister

Anthony Fernando v Rankiri Hettiarachchige Freddie Perera [supra], where the

petitioner having stated at the commencement of the affidavit that being a Christian, he

make oath and state as follows stated in the jurat that he affirms to the facts. The

question arose whether the said affidavit was valid since the petitioner, being a Christian,

had not sworn in the jurat. This Court adopted a liberal approach when it held that:

"In the affidavit filed along with the instant application, the jurat expressly sets out

the place and date on which the affidavit was signed. These are essential

requirements of an affidavit. There is no dispute that the affidavit was signed before

a Commissioner of Oaths and she had the authority to do so.

What is essential in an affidavit is to state that the person who is stating the facts

therein does so after taking an oath or affirmation as an affidavit is considered as

evidence in law. Therefore, it is necessary to show that the person who swears or

affirms to the facts stated in the affidavit did so before a competent authority or a

19

person. For this reason the place of swearing or affirmation, the date on which the

affidavit was signed are essential parts of the jurat. [emphasis added]

Apart from stating that the Petitioner signed the affidavit before a Commissioner for

Oaths, Jurat states the place and the date on which the affidavit was signed. Jurat in

an affidavit is an integral part of an affidavit and it cannot be considered in isolation.

In other words an affidavit should be considered in its totality. In applying this test

and considering the totality of the affidavit and applying the relevant law and

accepted practices, the fair conclusion that could be arrived is that the Petitioner has

stated the facts in the affidavit under oath before the Commissioner for Oaths as

demonstrated at the beginning of the affidavit and, the affidavit filed along with the

instant petition fulfills the requirements of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance.

In De Silva and Others v L.B. Finance Ltd [(1993) 1 Sri LR 371], even though the affidavit

commenced with the words - " We .... being Buddhists do hereby solemnly, sincerely and

truly declare and affirm as follows:", the jurat only stated that, The foregoing affidavit

was duly read over and explained by me to the within-named affirmants who having

understood the nature and contents signed same in my presence at Colombo on this 16th

day of August 1991". A preliminary objection was raised that the affidavit was invalid for

the reason that the jurat did not contain the fact of affirmation.

Chief Justice G. P. S De Silva, having considered the provisions of Section 438, the

averments in the affidavit and the wording of the jurat that the affidavit was "duly read

over and explained..... to the within-named affirmants ......." held that section 438 of the

Civil Procedure Code does not require that the fact of affirmation should be expressly

stated in the jurat of the affidavit. [emphasis added]. I must however say that even

though Section 438 is silent in this regard, Section 12(3) of the Ordinance, to which I have

already referred to, suggests otherwise.

In each of the above cases, there was either a contradiction between the opening

statement in the affidavit and the jurat as to whether what was administered was an oath

or affirmation, or the jurat did not support the opening statement. The conservative and

liberal approaches that our Courts have adopted over the years when confronted with

20

such errors and contradictions were considered by Amarasekara, J in Weerawansa v

Karunanayake [SC Appeal No. 59A/2006; SC minutes of 29th July 2020], where having

carried out a comprehensive survey of the cases in this regard including Ratwatte v

Sumathipala [supra] and Kumarasiri and Another v Rajapakse [supra], he concluded as

follows:

The above decisions indicate that on some occasions where there was a defect in

the jurat, our courts have acted somewhat strictly, and on other occasions more

liberally. In some instances, our courts have expressed that even though

technicalities should not be allowed to stand in the way of justice, the basic

requirements of the law must be fulfilled; and in some cases the rationale behind

making an oath or affirmation appears to have been considered and if it is visible

from the affidavit as a whole that it is a responsible statement admitting the truth

with regard to what is contained in the affidavit, it has been considered as valid.

Thus, a mere declaration or statement of facts have been rejected. When there were

contradictions between the contents of the affidavit and its jurat, in certain instances

affidavit was not given the legal recognition, perhaps due to the doubt that the

signing of the affidavit would have taken place blindly and not in a responsible

manner. In some cases, even if there were contradictory statements as to whether it

was affirmed or sworn, or when the jurat was silent as to whether it was affirmed or

sworn, or when the contents indicated that either it was affirmed or sworn as

required by law or when it was a responsible statement to vouch for the truth, the

relevant affidavit was considered as valid.

After perusing the aforementioned decisions of our superior courts and the relevant

provisions it is my view that what is necessary is whether the deponent made an oath

or affirmed, as the case may be, as to the truthfulness of the contents of the affidavit,

before the Justice of Peace or the Commissioner of oath. This has to be ascertained

not only by looking at what is stated in the jurat but taking the affidavit as a whole.

21

The second judgment relied upon by the District Court is Kumarasiri and Another v

Rajapakse [supra] where the affidavit was rejected since it does not state where the

affidavit was affirmed and thus violate the provisions contained in Section 12 (3) of the

Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance.

The third is Navaratne v Wadugodapitiya and Others [supra] where the purported

affidavit tendered with the amended petition had not been signed by the petitioner, with

the explanation being that the petitioner had by mistake placed the signature on the

petition instead of placing the same on the affidavit. The Court of Appeal held that, the

aforesaid mistake on the part of the plaintiff petitioner clearly indicates that the purported

affidavit has not been read over and explained to the plaintiff-petitioner nor has the

plaintiff - petitioner himself read the affidavit which is fatal to the validity of the said

affidavit. If as the plaintiff-petitioner tries to make out that he placed his signature on the

petition instead of on the affidavit then the purported affidavit has been signed by the

Justice of Peace prior to the plaintiff - petitioner placing his signature on the petition, for

it is obvious that the Justice of Peace should have observed that the affirmant's signature

was not on the affidavit when he entered the jurat clause. In effect it is obvious that the

purported affidavit does not comply with the provisions contained in section 438 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

The fourth is Umma Anina v Jawahar [supra] where the affidavit filed by the power of

attorney holder of the petitioner was rejected by Court since there was no averment in

the affidavit that the facts stated therein are within the personal knowledge of the

declarant and that he is able of his own knowledge and observation to testify to. When

there is no averment in the affidavit that the declarant deposes such facts from his

personal knowledge, it contravenes the provisions of the proviso to section 183A of the

Civil Procedure Code.

It must be emphasised that the role played by a Justice of the Peace is sacred, and that

when errors such as what I have referred to earlier do take place, it is not unreasonable

to draw an inference that such errors occurred due to the declarant not being present

before the Justice of the Peace as claimed in the jurat. Similarly, when there are no

contradictions and on the face of it, the fact that an oath was taken before a Justice of

22

the Peace or the fact that the signature of the declarant was placed before the Justice of

the Peace is borne out by the affidavit, it is not open for a Court to hold otherwise, unless

there are cogent reasons for doing so.

The issue is, are the cases relied upon by the District Court relevant to the facts of this

case? Trevor Fernando has stated at the beginning of the affidavit that he is a Christian

and that he has taken an oath. The jurat does not contradict the above position but

instead confirms that he has sworn in the presence of the Justice of the Peace on the date

and place specified in the jurat. There is no mix-up as in the cases referred to by the

learned District Judge. The Justice of the Peace has confirmed that Trevor Fernando

placed his signature before him, prior to himself signing the affidavit. Thus, the said

judgments had no relevance at all to the facts of this case.

Since what had been annexed to the appeal brief was only a black and white copy of the

impugned affidavit and given the fact that on the face of it, the affidavit appeared to have

been prepared in accordance with the law, I called for the record of the District Court out

of an abundance of caution in order to examine the original of the impugned affidavit.

Having done so, I am satisfied that nothing on the face of the affidavit could have given

rise to the conclusion that Trevor Fernando did not present himself before the Justice of

the Peace or that he did not take an oath or that he did not sign the affidavit in the

presence of the Justice of the Peace.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the District Court and the High Court erred

(a) when it followed judgments which had no application to the facts of this case, and (b)

when it failed to appreciate that the affidavit of Trevor Fernando has been prepared in

accordance with the applicable legal provisions.

Has the deponent stated that the facts are true?

This brings me to the next ground on which the High Court rejected the affidavit, which is

that Trevor Fernando has not stated in the affidavit that the facts contained in the

affidavit are true.

23

Referring to the aforementioned statutory provisions, Mr. Alagiyawanna submitted that

in the preparation of affidavits, the law draws a distinction between those who are of the

Christian faith and those who are not. It was his position that if the person who makes an

affidavit is a Christian, such person who is known as a deponent, is required to state so at

the beginning of the affidavit, is required to take an oath that the material contained in

such affidavit is within his personal knowledge and thereafter proceed to state the factual

matters. He stated further that when a Christian makes an oath, he or she does so in the

name of God, and therefore, it is presumed that once an oath is taken, what follows

thereafter is the truth and that, that is the manner in which sanctity is attached to the

contents of such affidavit.

The above submission is supported by the decision of this Court in Sooriya Enterprises

(International) Limited v Michael White & Company Limited [supra] where it was held

that, The fundamental obligation of a witness or deponent is to tell the truth and the

purpose of an oath or affirmation is to reinforce that obligation., and the following

definitions of the word, oath referred to in M. Tudor Danister Anthony Fernando v

Rankiri Hettiarachchige Freddie Perera [supra]:

Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrase [Sixth Edition (Volume 2)]: An

oath is a religious asseveration, by which a person renounces the mercy and

imprecates the vengeance of Heaven if he do not speak the truth (R. v. White, Leach,

430, 431).

The Oxford Dictionary of Law [Seventh Edition]: A pronouncement swearing the

truth of a statement or promise, usually by an appeal to God to witness its truth.

An oath is required by law for various purposes, in particular for affidavits and giving

evidence in court. The usual witnesss oath is: I swear by Almighty God that the

evidence which I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the

truth. Those who object to swearing an oath, on the grounds that to do so is

contrary to their religious beliefs or that they have no religious beliefs, may instead

affirm.

24

Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English: a formal promise to tell the truth in

a court of law.

This Court also referred to the definition of deponent in the Oxford Dictionary of Law

[Seventh Edition], where a deponent had been defined as a person who gives testimony

under oath, which is reduced to writing for use on the trial of a cause.

Mr. Alagiyawanna submitted further that a person who is not a Christian or being a

Christian has an objection to taking an oath, will not make an oath and hence, in order to

give validity to an affidavit, the declarant is required to affirm to the contents of such

affidavit by stating that he does so solemnly, sincerely and truly.

It was therefore his position that:

(a) non-Christians are allowed to make an affirmation instead of an oath and it is only

such an affirmation that must carry the words, solemnly, sincerely and truly;

(b) non-Christians who believe in God may take an oath;

(c) a Christian who does not have a conscientious objection to make an oath does not

have to say that he is doing so solemnly, sincerely and truly for the simple reason

that such person is taking an oath before stating the matters in the affidavit and in-

built in such oath is a sworn statement to tell the truth in the name of God and the

fact that such contents are true.

Having examined the original of the impugned affidavit, I am satisfied that Trevor

Fernando, being a Christian has taken an oath prior to stating the facts in paragraphs 1

16 of the affidavit. This is clearly borne out by the use of the words, uu l%sia;= Nla;slfhl=

jYfhka my; i|yka mrsos osjqrd m%ldY lrus' The definitions that I have already referred

to make it clear that in taking an oath, the deponent is swearing by God to tell the truth.

Thus, there was no further necessity for Trevor Fernando to state elsewhere in the

affidavit that he is stating the truth or for him to state that he is stating so sincerely and

truly. The High Court clearly erred when it concluded that the deponent has not stated

25

anywhere in the affidavit that the facts contained in the affidavit are true or that it is not

clear who has sworn the affidavit.

Were the contents of the affidavit read over to Trevor Fernando?

The third ground on which the affidavit was rejected was that it is not clear if the contents

of the affidavit have been read over to Trevor Fernando or whether Trevor Fernando has

read the contents himself. Whether the contents of the affidavit were read over by Trevor

Fernando on his own or whether the contents were read over or explained to Trevor

Fernando by the Justice of the Peace, what is important is that Trevor Fernando must

understand the contents of the affidavit and that the contents of the affidavit have been

stated under an oath which then assures the truthfulness of the contents of the affidavit.

The jurat makes it clear that Trevor Fernando has read the contents of the affidavit, has

understood the contents thereof, has sworn before the Justice of the Peace and

thereafter placed his signature on 18th June 2015 [by; kus i|yka osjqreus m%ldY jsiska lshjd

f;areusf.k osjqreus os jraI 2015 la jq Pqks ui 18 jk osk fld<T os w;aika ;nk ,oS]. It is also

clear that Trevor Fernando has signed before the Justice of the Peace and that the Justice

of the Peace has signed thereafter.

I am therefore of the view that the High Court erred when it rejected the affidavit on the

ground that it is not clear if the contents of the affidavit have been read over to the

deponent or whether the deponent read the contents himself.

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, I answer the aforementioned question of law in the

affirmative. The judgment of the High Court dated 19th February 2020 and the Order of

the District Court dated 9th June 2017 are hereby set aside. The District Court of

Mahiyanganaya is directed to act in terms of Section 14A of the Civil Procedure Code and

consider in accordance with the law the application of the Petitioner contained in the

petition filed on 10th August 2015.
