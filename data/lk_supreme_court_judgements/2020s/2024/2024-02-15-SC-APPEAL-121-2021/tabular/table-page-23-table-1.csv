"Referring to the aforementioned statutory provisions, Mr. Alagiyawanna submitted that"
"in the preparation of affidavits, the law draws a distinction between those who are of the"
"Christian faith and those who are not. It was his position that if the person who makes an"
"affidavit is a Christian, such person who is known as a deponent, is required to state so at"
"the beginning of the affidavit, is required to take an oath that the material contained in"
"such affidavit is within his personal knowledge and thereafter proceed to state the factual"
"matters. He stated further that when a Christian makes an oath, he or she does so in the"
"name  of  God,  and  therefore,  it  is  presumed  that  once  an  oath  is  taken,  what  follows"
"thereafter is the truth and that, that is the manner in which sanctity is attached to the"
"contents of such affidavit."
