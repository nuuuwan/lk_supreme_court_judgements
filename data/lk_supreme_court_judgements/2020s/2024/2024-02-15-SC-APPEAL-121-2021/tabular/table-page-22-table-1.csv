"the Peace or the fact that the signature of the declarant was placed before the Justice of"
"the Peace is borne out by the affidavit, it is not open for a Court to hold otherwise, unless"
"there are cogent reasons for doing so."
"T
he issue is, are the cases relied upon by the District Court relevant to the facts of this"
"case? Trevor Fernando has stated at the beginning of the affidavit that he is a Christian"
"and  that  he  has  taken  an  oath.  The  jurat  does  not  contradict  the  above  position  but"
"instead confirms that he has sworn in the presence of the Justice of the Peace on the date"
"and  place  specified  in  the  jurat.  There  is  no  mix-up  as  in  the  cases  referred  to  by  the"
"learned  District  Judge.  The  Justice  of  the  Peace  has  confirmed  that  Trevor  Fernando"
"placed  his  signature  before  him,  prior  to  himself  signing  the  affidavit.  Thus,  the  said"
"judgments had no relevance at all to the facts of this case."
"S
ince what had been annexed to the appeal brief was only a black and white copy of the"
"impugned affidavit and given the fact that on the face of it, the affidavit appeared to have"
"been prepared in accordance with the law, I called for the record of the District Court out"
"of an abundance of caution in order to examine the original of the impugned affidavit."
"Having done so, I am satisfied that nothing on the face of the affidavit could have given"
"rise to the conclusion that Trevor Fernando did not present himself before the Justice of"
"the  Peace  or  that  he  did  not  take  an  oath  or  that  he  did  not  sign  the  affidavit  in  the"
"presence of the Justice of the Peace."
"I
n these circumstances, I am of the view that the District Court and the High Court erred"
"(a) when it followed judgments which had no application to the facts of this case, and (b)"
"when it failed to appreciate that the affidavit of Trevor Fernando has been prepared in"
"accordance with the applicable legal provisions."
"H
as the deponent stated that the facts are true?"
"T
his brings me to the next ground on which the High Court rejected the affidavit, which is"
"that  Trevor  Fernando  has  not  stated  in  the  affidavit  that  the  facts  contained  in  the"
"affidavit are true."
