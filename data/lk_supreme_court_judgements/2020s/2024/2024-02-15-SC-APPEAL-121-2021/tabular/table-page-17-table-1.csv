"Has the affidavit been sworn before a Justice of the Peace?"
"A
n allegation that is made time and again with regard to the validity of an affidavit is that"
"(a) the declarant was never present before the Justice of the Peace; or (b) the affidavit"
"was never read over to the declarant or by the declarant; or (c) the declarant did not sign"
"the affidavit in the presence of the Justice of the Peace, and thus, the entire affidavit is a"
"sham and lacks the sanctity that must be attached to an affidavit for a Court of Law to act"
"upon it as evidence of the matters contained in the pleadings. What gives rise to such"
"allegations are the multitude of “errors” committed in preparing an affidavit especially in"
"the jurat of an affidavit, and with regard to the religion of the declarant and the oath or"
"affirmation that is said to have been administered prior to stating the facts in an affidavit,"
"with the argument being that such errors could not have either occurred or else gone"
