Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs-respondents filed this action in the District Court of Mount

Lavinia against the defendant-appellant seeking a declaration of title to

Lot D in Plan No. 684, ejectment of the defendant therefrom and

damages. The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs

action and claiming title to Lot D on prescription. After trial, the District

Court entered the judgment as prayed for in the prayer to the plaint. On

appeal, the High Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. This

Court had granted leave to appeal against the judgments of the Courts

below on two questions of law:

(a) Has the District Court and the High Court misinterpreted and

misconceived the terms of settlement when the terms of settlement

did not give Lot D in Plan No. 684 referred to in the plaint to any

party?

(b) In the circumstances pleaded, are the judgments of the District

Court and the High Court correct and according to law?

The District Court and the High Court rejected the defendants

prescriptive claim. This Court also did not grant leave to appeal against

the refusal of the defendants prescriptive claim. Hence there is no

necessity to consider the defendants claim on prescription.

5

SC/APPEAL/75/2014

Learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant submits that

notwithstanding the defendants failure to prove prescriptive title, the

plaintiff did not prove title to Lot D. He argues that the District Judge

was wrong to have held with the plaintiffs on the basis that the plaintiffs

became entitled to Lot D in terms of the settlement entered into in

another case (962/L) between the same parties.

Let me now consider whether this line of argument is sustainable.

The defendant and the plaintiffs were parties to case No. 962/L. The said

case was settled. In accordance with the settlement, Lots A, B and F of

Plan No. 684 were transferred by the plaintiffs as owners of the said Lots

to the defendant by Deed No. 1988. It had later been realised that the

plaintiffs had mistakenly transferred Lot D of the said Plan also to the

defendant by that Deed.

This mistake has been rectified by the Court of Appeal in Case No.

CA/83/1988(F). Accordingly, Deed No. 1988 has been cancelled and new

Deed No. 2232 has been executed by the plaintiffs transferring only Lots

A, B and F to the defendant.

It may be noted that when Lots A, B, F and D were transferred by the

plaintiffs to the defendant by Deed No. 1988, they did so as the owners

of the said Lots. This was not contested by the defendant.

It is the position of the plaintiffs that their father became entitled to Lot

D by Deed No. 35 and they became entitled to this Lot through their

father. At the trial, this Deed was not marked subject to proof. Deed No.

35 does not refer to Lot D in Plan No. 684, the reason being that at the

time of the execution of Deed No. 35, Plan No. 684 was not in existence.

However, the plaintiffs position is that what was purchased by Deed No.

35 is crystalized in Lot D. This is not a new position taken up by the

plaintiffs for the first time in this appeal.

6

SC/APPEAL/75/2014

It may be noted that when Lot D was transferred by Deed No. 1988

executed on 05.11.1979, the plaintiffs also described Lot D as the land

described in the schedule to Deed No. 35 vide item 4 of the schedule to

the Deed. This was not disputed by the defendant when Deed No. 1988

was executed in his favour.

The 3rd plaintiff in her evidence clearly described how the plaintiffs

became entitled to Lot D. The learned District Judge in the judgment has

referred to Deed No. 35 as the title Deed of the plaintiffs father. The 1st

issue raised by the plaintiffs was regarding title. This issue was answered

by the District Judge in favour of the plaintiffs.

In terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the defendant shall,

inter alia, prove adverse possession against the true owner. This land was

not a no mans land. What the defendant prayed in paragraph (b) of his

answer was

.

The defendant has indirectly accepted that the plaintiffs are the true

owners of Lot D, but his claim is that he acquired the said Lot by

prescription. As stated previously, this claim has been rejected by all

Courts.

For the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to accept the argument of learned

Presidents Counsel for the defendant that the plaintiffs failed to prove

title to Lot D. The plaintiffs proved sufficient title to Lot D on a balance

of probabilities as required from a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action. The

plaintiffs need not prove absolute title to Lot D against the whole world.

They need to prove title only against the defendant.

I accept that the learned District Judge was not correct when it was

stated in the judgment that the plaintiffs became entitled to Lot D in

7

SC/APPEAL/75/2014

terms of the aforesaid settlement. However, merely because the District

Judge has stated so in the judgment, this Court need not set aside the

judgment of the District Court and allow the appeal. Such attitude by the

apex Court will cause grave prejudice to the plaintiffs for no fault of them.

When the judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiffs as prayed for

in the prayer to the plaint, there was no reason for the plaintiffs to prefer

an appeal against the judgment. The plaintiffs should not be made to

suffer for the lapses of the learned District Judge.

I answer the first question of law quoted above in the affirmative, which

is in favour of the defendant. I answer the second question of law as

follows: The conclusion of the judgments of the Courts below is correct.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without costs.
