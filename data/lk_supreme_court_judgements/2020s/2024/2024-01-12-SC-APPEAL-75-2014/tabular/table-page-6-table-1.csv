"It  may  be  noted  that  when  Lot  D  was  transferred  by  Deed  No.  1988"
"executed on 05.11.1979, the plaintiffs also described Lot D as the land"
"described in the schedule to Deed No. 35 – vide item 4 of the schedule to"
"the Deed. This was not disputed by the defendant when Deed No. 1988"
"was executed in his favour."
"The  3rd  plaintiff  in  her  evidence  clearly  described  how  the  plaintiffs"
"became entitled to Lot D. The learned District Judge in the judgment has"
"referred to Deed No. 35 as the title Deed of the plaintiffs’ father. The 1st"
"issue raised by the plaintiffs was regarding title. This issue was answered"
"by the District Judge in favour of the plaintiffs."
"In terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the defendant shall,"
"inter alia, prove adverse possession against the true owner. This land was"
"not a “no man’s land”. What the defendant prayed in paragraph (b) of his"
"answer  was  “මෙහි  පහත  උපමේඛනමේ  විස්තර  වන  ඉඩෙ  කාලාවමරෝධ  භුක්තිමෙන්"
"පැමිණිලිකරුවන්ට  මහෝ  මවන  මකායි  කවමරකුට  හා  එමරහිව  විත්තිකරුට  සතු  වී  ඇි  බවට"
"නිමෙෝග කර තීන්ු ප්‍රකාශ කරන මෙස ද”."
"The  defendant  has  indirectly  accepted  that  the  plaintiffs  are  the  true"
"owners  of  Lot  D,  but  his  claim  is  that  he  acquired  the  said  Lot  by"
"prescription.  As  stated  previously,  this  claim  has  been  rejected  by  all"
"Courts."
"For the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to accept the argument of learned"
"President’s Counsel  for the  defendant  that the plaintiffs failed to prove"
"title to Lot D. The plaintiffs proved ‘sufficient title’ to Lot D on a balance"
"of probabilities as required from a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action. The"
"plaintiffs need not prove absolute title to Lot D against the whole world."
"They need to prove title only against the defendant."
"I  accept  that  the  learned  District  Judge  was  not  correct  when  it  was"
"stated  in  the  judgment  that  the  plaintiffs  became  entitled  to  Lot  D  in"
