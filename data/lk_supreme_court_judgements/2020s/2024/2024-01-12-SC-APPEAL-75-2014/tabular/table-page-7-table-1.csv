"When the judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiffs as prayed for"
"in the prayer to the plaint, there was no reason for the plaintiffs to prefer"
"an  appeal  against  the  judgment.  The  plaintiffs  should  not  be  made  to"
"suffer for the lapses of the learned District Judge."
"I answer the first question of law quoted above in the affirmative, which"
"is  in  favour  of  the  defendant.  I  answer  the  second  question  of  law  as"

"The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without costs."
