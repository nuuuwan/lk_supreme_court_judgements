"In Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v V/o Exportchleb [1965] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 223 at 229 and 230, Lord"
"Denning MR held:"
"“Within one issue, there may be several points available which go to aid one"
"party  or  the  other in  his  efforts to  secure  a  determination  of  the  issue  in  his"
"favour. The rule then is that each party must use reasonable diligence to bring"
"forward every point which he thinks would help him. If he omits to raise any"
"particular point, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident (which would"
"or might have decided the issue in his favour) he may find himself shut out from"
"raising that point again, at any rate in any case where the self-same issue arises"
