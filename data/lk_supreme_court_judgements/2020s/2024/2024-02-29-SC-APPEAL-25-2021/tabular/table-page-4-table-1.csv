"The appellant further stated that later, certain disputes arose from the said Sub-Contract with the"
"respondent. However, as they were unable to settle the said disputes amicably, the said disputes"
"were referred to arbitration in terms of Clause 17 of the said Sub-Contract by Notice of Arbitration"
"dated  2nd  of  April,  2014.  (The  said  Notice  of  Arbitration  was  signed  by  the  appellant  as  the"
"Managing Director of Trading Engineering Manufacturing Company.) However, the respondent"
"denied the claim by reply dated 30th of April, 2014 and included a counterclaim in the said reply."
"The appellant stated that it was later found out that, by mistake, his business was named as a"
"company incorporated under the Companies Act of Sri Lanka in the said Sub-Contract and"
"in the Notice of Arbitration, whereas it was in fact a Sole Proprietor and not an incorporated"
"company  under  the  Companies  Act  No.  7  of  2007.  Further,  the  Registration  No.  (AA)  4726,"
"referred to as the company registration number in the said Sub-Contract, is the business registration"
"number given to the Sole Proprietorship registered by him."
"Hence, a new Notice of Arbitration was sent to the respondent by the appellantâ€™s Attorney-at-Law"
"on the 20th of June, 2014 informing the respondent that the initial Notice of Arbitration dated 2nd"
"of April, 2014 is withdrawn and that the new Notice of Arbitration should be considered as the"
"correct Notice of Arbitration. In the said Notice of Arbitration, the appellant was named as the"
"claimant  to  the  dispute  referred  to  arbitration.  Furthermore,  the  appellant  included  additional"
"claims in the second Notice of Arbitration."
"The appellant further stated that the respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal"
"on the basis that the Notice of Arbitration dated 20th of June, 2014 refers to the appellant as a Sole"
"Proprietor, whereas the said Sub-Contract was entered into between the respondent and a company"
"said to be duly incorporated in Sri Lanka, namely Trading Engineering Manufacturing Company."
"Thus, there was no agreement between the appellant and the respondent to arbitrate the disputes"
"referred to in the Notice of Arbitration."
"After hearing the submissions of the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal delivered its Order on the said"
"objection raised by the respondent and terminated the proceedings of the said Arbitration on the"
"basis, inter alia, that the said Sub-Contract is not a valid contract and therefore there is no valid"
"arbitration agreement between the parties to refer the alleged disputes to arbitration. Further, it was"
"held  that, as the Arbitral  Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from  the Notice of Arbitration issued"
"under  the  arbitration  clause  and  as  the  said  Sub-Contract  is  void  ab  initio,  both  Notices  of"
"Arbitration have no force or effect in law."
