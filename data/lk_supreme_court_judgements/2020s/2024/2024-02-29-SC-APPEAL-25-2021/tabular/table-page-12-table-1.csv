"In The Law of Contracts, Volume I at page 532 by C.G. Weeramantry, it states;"
"“There  must  in  general  be  two  parties  to  a  contract.  If  one  of  the  parties  to  the"
"contract be dead or non-existent no contract can come into being.”"
"In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the said Sub-Contract is void ab initio as one of the"
"parties  to  the  said  contract  lacked  the  capacity  to  enter  into  the  said  contract,  which  is  a  core"
"element  in  forming  a  valid  contract.  A  similar  view  was  expressed  in  The  Law  of  Contracts,"
"Volume I at page 95 by C.G. Weeramantry which is as follows;"
"“The absence in a contract of any of the essentials of a valid contract would render"
"it null and void ab initio.”"
"Meeting of the Minds"
"The plaint filed in the Commercial High Court contains 6 causes of action based on the said Sub-"
"Contract filed along with the plaint marked as ‘P2’. It is apparent that the said causes of action are"
"founded upon the said Sub-Contract."
"In fact, following the proper procedure and accepted drafting skills of plaints, the appellant has"
"averred  the  following  in  respect  of  each  cause  of  action  preferred  to  in  the  plaint  filed  in  the"
"Commercial High Court;"
"“The Plaintiff re-iterates the averments contained in paragraph 1 to 21 above.”"
"Hence, a careful consideration of the plaint shows that all the claims are based on the said Sub-"
"Contract. Moreover, in a contract, the parties consent to perform certain obligations arising from"
"the contract. Thus, it is necessary to have a “meeting of the minds” of the parties to perform the"
"contractual rights/obligations under the contract. However, in the said Sub-Contract as one party"
"is not an entity, it is not possible to have the meeting of the minds of the parties in order to form a"
"contract. This aspect also renders the said Sub-Contract void ab initio."
