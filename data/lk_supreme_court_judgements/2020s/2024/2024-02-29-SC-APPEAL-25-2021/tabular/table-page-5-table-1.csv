"Being aggrieved by the said Order of the Arbitral Tribunal, the appellant filed an application on"
"the 20th of November, 2014 in the High Court in terms of section 11 of the Arbitration Act No. 11"
"of 1995 praying, inter alia, to set aside the said Order and seeking a declaration that there is a valid"
"and binding arbitration agreement between the parties to refer the disputes to arbitration under and"
"in terms of the said Sub-Contract."
"After hearing the parties, the said application was dismissed by the learned High Court Judge by"
"his judgment dated 5th of June, 2017 on the basis that the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain"
"the said application as there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to appeal against an Order where"
"an Arbitral Tribunal has ruled on its jurisdiction. The appellants, instead of appealing against the"
"said judgment, instituted the action under reference in the Commercial High Court on the 19th of"
"October, 2018 praying inter alia;"
