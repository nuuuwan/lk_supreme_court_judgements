Order on: 08.08.2024

Order of Court

These two applications were filed impugning the sale of 90% of the shares of the Government

owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. (SLICL) to the private sector companies named as

respondents to their applications. The judgment in these two applications were delivered on

04.06.2009.

The relief granted and the consequential orders and directions made in the judgment are as

follows:

1. The Court declares that the petitioners have established an infringement of the

fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution in respect of the sale

of 90% of the shares of SLIC, a company fully owned by the Government of Sri Lanka and

that such infringement has occurred due to wrongful and unlawful executive

administrative actions. Accordingly the relief sought in prayer (b) of both applications,

namely that there has been an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution, is granted.

2. This Court has already held that the SSPA signed by the 5th, 28th, and 29th Respondents is

null and void ab initio. Accordingly the Court holds that the sale of 90% of the shares of

SLIC to 28th and 29th respondent companies under and in terms of the SSPA was also

illegal and invalid ab initio. Accordingly the Court directs that the legal ownership of the

90% of the shares purported to have been sold to 28th and 29th respondent companies

shall forthwith vest in the Secretary to the Treasury to be held on behalf of the

Government of Sri Lanka. The Board of Directors of SLIC stands removed forthwith. In

order to ensure the continuity of the commercial transactions of the SLICL, effected in

the ordinary course of business, the Court declares and directs that the 90% of the shares

of SLICL purported to have been sold to the 28th and 29th respondent companies on

11.4.2003 shall be deemed to have been held by the 28th and 29th respondent companies

from 11.4.2003 for and on behalf of the Secretary to the Treasury.

3. The purchase price of 90% of the shares of SLICL namely Rs. Six Billion and Fifty million

shall be returned to the 28th respondent Milford Holdings (Private) Ltd by the

Government of Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka had nothing to do with the 29th

respondent foreign company Greenfield Pacific EM Holdings brought into this

transaction by the 5th respondent Acting Secretary to the Treasury. The Government had

not financial transactions with it. The purchase price for the shares sold to the 29th

respondent company had been paid to the Government by the 28th respondent Milford

Holdings (Private) Ltd. The Secretary to the Treasury is directed to cause Treasury Bonds

redeemable in 5 years from today at current interest rates be issued in favour of Milford

Holding (Private) Ltd for the said sum of Rupees Six Billion and Fifty Million (Rs.

6,050,000,000/-).

4. The 28th and 29th respondents are entitled to retain the profits of the SLICL derived by

them from 11.4.2003 to 4th June 2009 in lieu of the interest for the aforesaid sum of Rs.

Six Billion and Fifty Million (Rs. 6,050,000,000/-). The Secretary to the Treasury is

directed to cause profits of the SLICL computed and audited from the date of the last

audited balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June 2009 to enable the 28th and 29th

respondents to obtain the net profits after tax of SLICL from the date of the last audited

balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June 2009. The Secretary to the Treasury shall pay the

amount of profits due to 28th and 29th respondent companies according to the audited

computation to be made as aforesaid. It is further directed that since the SSPA was void

ab initio, the return of the purchase price by Treasury Bonds redeemable in five years

with the current rate of interest and the right to the retention of profits from 11.4.2003

to 4.6.2009 has been ordered on the basis of a quasi contract to grant just and equitable

relief to the 28th and 29th respondents in respect of the payment they have made for the

purported purchase of the shares of SLICL. This direction is made after taking into

consideration the public interest which this Court is bound to uphold. The 28th and 29th

respondents are not entitled to any other payment, except the payment authorized

under relief number 6 set out below.

5. Since it is necessary in the interest of the public to ensure proper and efficient

management of SLICL, this Court directs the Secretary to the Treasury, in consultation

with the Minister of Finance, to submit to this Court for its approval the appropriate

number of names of persons who have recognized academic/professional qualifications

and more than 10 years’ experience in any one or more of the fields of business

management, accountancy, law, commerce, economics, and insurance to be appointed

to the Board of Directors of SLICL. The Secretary to the Treasury is directed to submit the

list of names within two weeks from today. The Secretary to the Treasury is hereby

authorized to make suitable arrangements to administer the affairs of SLICL until a

Board of Directors is appointed.

6. Employees of the SLICL were allotted 10% of the shares of SLICL. Under the SSPA the

purchasers were entitled to purchase shares allotted to employees from those who

agreed to sell their shares to the 28th and 29th respondents at the same price paid to the

Government per share for 90% of the shares. (Rs. 134 per share) In view of the declared

invalidity of SSPA, the right given to the 28th and 29th respondents to purchase

employees’ shares has no legal basis. Accordingly if any share or shares has/have been

purchased by the 28th and 29th respondents from employees after 11.4.2003, all such

shares shall also vest forthwith in the Secretary of the Treasury to be held on behalf of

the Government Payment to the 28th and 29th respondents for such shares shall be made

by the Secretary to the Treasury in the manner provided for the repayment of the

purchase price paid to the Government.

7. It is clear from the material placed before this Court that Ernst and Young who

functioned as auditors to SLICL when it belonged to the Government has continued to

function as auditors of SLICL under the purchasers thereby serving two masters with

conflicting interests (during the period fixed for the adjustment of purchase price

consideration). Accordingly we direct that Ernst and Young stand removed forthwith

from the position of Auditor of the SLICL. The new Board of Directors shall select and

appoint an Auditor for SLICL according to the appropriate procedure.

8. The petitioners in both applications, SCFR 117/2007 and SCFR 158/2007, have filed their

applications in public Interest. The Court notes the expenses they have incurred and the

efforts they have made to bring the subject matter of these applications before this

Court. The Court does not wish to award costs to them as it is not proper to value their

services in terms of money. Instead the Court places on record its appreciation of the

valuable services rendered by them to uphold the public interest. We direct the Registrar

of this Court to issue a certified copy of this judgment to the petitioners of SCFR

117/2007 and the petitioner in SCFR 158/2007 without payment.

9. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment forthwith

to the Secretary to the Treasury.

10. The Secretary to the Treasury may seek directions from this Court which he may deem

necessary from time to time.

On 03.03.2022, the 28th and 29th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and

4th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No.117/2007 filed motions in the respective cases.

After a lengthy narrative of events that took place subsequent to the delivery of judgment, the

following reliefs were sought:

a) Direct the Secretary to the Treasury to comply with the Judgment dated 4th June 2009

and/or the subsequent consequential Orders made in this case by Your Lordships' Court,

b) Direct the Secretary to the Treasury (representing the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka) to pay the Net Profit entitlement of the 3rd and 4th Respondents (28th and 29th

Respondents in SCFR Application No: 158/2007) to the 3rd Respondent (28th Respondent

in SCFR 158 / 2007), with legal interest,

c) In the alternative to (b) above, since Net Profits were Ordered to be paid in lieu of

interest, direct the Secretary to the Treasury (representing the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka) to pay legal interest on the capital sum of Rs. 6050 million for the

period from 11.4.2003 to 4.6.2009 to the 3rd Respondent (28th Respondent in SCFR

158/2007) after deducting the dividends paid during the subject period, with legal

interest on the said aggregate amount from 4.6.2009 until date of payment in full.

The Hon. Attorney General filed a motion dated 03.11.2022 objecting to this application on the

following amongst other grounds:

(a) The Court has not permitted any other party other than the Secretary to the Treasury to

seek further directions from Court.

(b) In view of the settled principles in Ganeshanathan v. Vivienne Goonewardene [(1984) 1

Sri. L. R. 319] and Jeyaraj Fernandopulle v. Premachandra De Silva and Others [(1996)

1 Sri. L. R. 70], this Court does not have the jurisdiction to re-hear, review, alter or vary

its decision except in limited circumstances which have not been made out in this case.

(c) The 28th and 29th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and 4th

Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No.117/2007 are seeking to implement a

misconceived interpretation of the judgment and orders made in this application.

Parties were heard in favour and against the contents of the motion dated 03.03.2022.

In Ganeshanathan (supra), it was held that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to act in

revision of cases decided by itself. None of the provisions of the Constitution expressly

conferring jurisdiction confer such a jurisdiction on it. Nor has the Legislature conferred such a

jurisdiction by law. The Supreme Court if a Court of last resort in appeal and there is finality in

its judgment whether it is right or wrong. That is the policy of the law and the purpose of

Chapter XV of the Constitution. As a superior Court of record the Supreme Court has inherent

powers to correct its errors which are demonstrably and manifestly wrong and where it is

necessary in the interests of justice Decisions made per incuriam can be corrected. These

powers are adjuncts to existing jurisdiction to remedy injustice - they cannot be made the

source of new jurisdictions to revise a judgment rendered by that court.

In Jeyaraj Fernandopulle (supra), it was held that when the Supreme Court has decided a

matter, the matter is at an end and there is no occasion for other judges to be called upon to

review or revise a matter. The Supreme Court is a creature of statute and its powers are

statutory. The Court has no statutory jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution or by any other

law to rehear, review, alter or vary its decision. Decisions of the Supreme Court are final. As a

general rule, no Court has power to rehear, review, alter or vary any judgment or order made

by it after it has been entered. A Court has no power to amend or set aside its judgment or

order where, it has come to light or if it transpires that the judgment or order has been

obtained by fraud or false evidence. In such cases relief must be sought by way of appeal or

where appropriate, by separate action, to set aside the judgment or order. The object of the

rule is to bring litigation to finality. However, all Courts have inherent power in certain

circumstances to revise an order made by them.

Nevertheless, an examination of the motions filed in these two cases show that it is to seek

directions on the Secretary to the Treasury to comply with the judgment dated 4th June 2009

and the subsequent orders. There is nothing mentioned of any error on the part of the Court in

pronouncing the judgment and for any correction thereto.

The application is to direct the Secretary to the Treasury to pay the Net Profit entitlement of

the 28th and 29th Respondents to the 28th Respondent with legal interest, or alternatively, direct

the Secretary to the Treasury to pay legal interest on the capital sum of Rs. 6050 million for the

period from 11.4.2003 to 4.6.2009 to the 28th Respondent after deducting the dividends paid

during the subject period with legal interest on the aid aggregate amount from 4.6.2009 until

the date of payment in full.

In support of this contention, the learned President’s Counsel for the 28th and 29th Respondent

in S.C.F.R. Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and 4th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application

No.117/2007 relied on the relief granted under (4) above by Court which reads as follows:

“The 28th and 29th respondents are entitled to retain the profits of the SLICL derived by

them from 11.4.2003 to 4th June 2009 in lieu of the interest for the aforesaid sum of Rs.

Six Billion and Fifty Million (Rs. 6,050,000,000/-). The Secretary to the Treasury is

directed to cause profits of the SLICL computed and audited from the date of the last

audited balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June 2009 to enable the 28th and 29th

respondents to obtain the net profits after tax of SLICL from the date of the last audited

balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June 2009. The Secretary to the Treasury shall pay the

amount of profits due to 28th and 29th respondent companies according to the audited

computation to be made as aforesaid. It is further directed that since the SSPA was void

ab initio, the return of the purchase price by Treasury Bonds redeemable in five years

with the current rate of interest and the right to the retention of profits from 11.4.2003

to 4.6.2009 has been ordered on the basis of a quasi-contract to grant just and equitable

relief to the 28th and 29th respondents in respect of the payment they have made for the

purported purchase of the shares of SLICL. This direction is made after taking into

consideration the public interest which this Court is bound to uphold. The 28th and 29th

respondents are not entitled to any other payment, except the payment authorized

under relief number 6 set out below.”

We are of the view that there is no merit in the contention of the 28th and 29th Respondent in

S.C.F.R. Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and 4th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application

No.117/2007.

The first paragraph makes it clear that the 28th and 29th Respondent in S.C.F.R. Application No.

158/2007 are entitled to retain the profits of the SLICL derived by them from 11.4.2003 to 4th

June 2009 in lieu of the interest for the aforesaid sum of Rs. Six Billion and Fifty Million (Rs.

6,050,000,000/-). The Court has proceeded on the basis that such profits are with the 28th and

29th Respondents and held that they are entitled to retain them. This has been explained by

Court in the same paragraph later in stating that since the SSPA was void ab initio, the return of

the purchase price by Treasury Bonds redeemable in five years with the current rate of interest

and the right to the retention of profits from 11.4.2003 to 4.6.2009 has been ordered on the

basis of a quasi contract to grant just and equitable relief to the 28th and 29th respondents in

respect of the payment they have made for the purported purchase of the shares of SLICL

(emphasis added).

The next part of the judgment further clarifies the first paragraph of (4) by directing the

Secretary to the Treasury to cause profits of the SLICL to be computed and audited from the

date of the last audited balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June 2009 to enable the 28th and 29th

Respondents to obtain the net profits after tax of SLICL for the said period. There was no

dispute between the parties that the accounts of the SLICL had been audited up to 31.12.2008.

Hence, the Secretary to the Treasury was under a duty to cause profits of the SLICL to be

computed and audited from the date of the last audited balance sheet of the SLICL to 4th June

2009.

According to the Financial Statements dated 4th June 2009 as audited by KPMG for the period

01.01.2009 to 06.04.2009, the SLICL had not made any profits but in fact incurred a loss during

this period. Thus, there is no question of payment of any profits to the 28th and 29th

Respondents for the period 01.01.2009 to 06.04.2009.

Upon an examination of all the material placed before Court, we are of the view that there are

no further obligations that the Secretary to the Treasury must perform in terms of the

judgment delivered in this case.

Accordingly, we are of the view that the application of the 28th and 29th Respondent in S.C.F.R.

Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and 4th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No.117/2007 must

be rejected. To allow their application will amount to Court acting contrary to the established

legal position as expounded in Ganeshanathan v. Vivienne Goonewardene [(1984) 1 Sri. L. R.

319] and Jeyaraj Fernandopulle vs. Premachandra De Silva and Others [(1996) 1 Sri. L. R. 70].

Relief prayed for in motions dated 03.03.2022 filed by the 28th and 29th Respondents in S.C.F.R.

Application No. 158/2007 and 3rd and 4th Respondents in S.C.F.R. Application No.117/2007 are

refused.
