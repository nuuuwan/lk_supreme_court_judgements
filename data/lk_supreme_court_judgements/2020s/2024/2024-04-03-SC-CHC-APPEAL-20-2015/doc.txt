Background

The plaintiff filed this action in the Commercial High Court against the

four defendants seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 8,004,744/58 with

interest thereon from 01.07.2013 till the date of the decree and thereafter

on the aggregate amount of the decree till payment in full. The plaintiffs

case is based on the cheque discounting agreement marked P1 entered

into between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The account statements

were marked P2 and P3. The letter of demand sent to the 1st defendant

was marked P4. The 2nd-4th defendants were the guarantors to the said

agreement. Those guarantees were marked P5, P5(a) and P5(b). The

letters of demand sent to the guarantors were marked P6, P6(a) and P6(b).

Summons were served on all four defendants but none of them came

forward to contest the plaintiffs case. According to the journal entry

dated 06.05.2014, the Commercial High Court fixed the case for ex parte

3

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

trial against all the defendants and directed the plaintiff to lead evidence

by way of an affidavit.

The journal entry dated 01.10.2014 reveals that, the affidavit evidence

(of the senior executive of the plaintiff company), together with the

originals of the aforesaid documents, was tendered to Court on that date

and the case was fixed for the ex parte judgment on 05.11.2014.

I must add that the documents tendered with the affidavit were not new

documents. They were part of the plaint filed in Court and served on the

defendants with summons.

The learned High Court Judge by judgment dated 05.11.2014 dismissed

the plaintiffs action. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.

Although this Court issued notices on all the defendants on several

occasions, they did not participate in the hearing before this Court either.

The Commercial High Court dismissed the plaintiffs action on two

grounds:

(a) Notwithstanding the plaintiffs assertion in the affidavit evidence

that both the plaintiff and the 1st defendant are incorporated

companies, the plaintiff failed to provide documentary evidence to

prove their incorporation and registration;

(b) The Chief Legal Officer of the plaintiff company has signed the

proxy on behalf of the plaintiff company instead of the directors.

The burden of proof in an ex-parte trial

In a civil case the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities. What

does this mean? In Miller v. Minister of Pensions [1947] 2 All ER 372 at

374, Lord Denning declared:

4

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of

probability, but not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the

evidence is such that the tribunal can say: We think it more

probable than not, the burden is discharged, but, if the probabilities

are equal, it is not.

Are there degrees of proof within the standard of proof of the balance of

probabilities? Theoretically, the answer is in the negative, but practically,

such degrees do exist.

In Bater v. Bater [1950] 2 All ER 458, it was held that there may be

degrees of probability within the civil standard of proof of balance of

probabilities; the degree of proof must be commensurate with the

occasion and proportionate to the subject-matter. In this case, wife

sought for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The Court of Appeal held that

it was not a misdirection for the trial judge to have stated that the

petitioner must prove her case beyond reasonable doubt. Bucknill L.J.,

with whom Somervell L.J. agreed, considered that a high standard of

proof was necessary due to the significance of the case to both the

parties involved and the community. Denning L.J. stated at page 459:

The difference of opinion which has been evoked about the standard

of proof in these cases may well turn out to be more a matter of

words than anything else. It is true that by our law there is a higher

standard of proof is required in criminal cases than in civil cases,

but this is subject to the qualification that there is no absolute

standard in either case. In criminal cases the charge must be proved

beyond reasonable doubt, but there may be degrees of proof within

that standard. Many great judges have said that, in proportion as

the crime is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear. So also in civil

cases. The case may be proved by a preponderance of probability,

but there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The

5

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

degree depends on the subject-matter. A civil court, when

considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require a higher degree

of probability than that which it would require if considering whether

negligence were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as

a criminal court, even when it is considering a charge of a criminal

nature, but still it does require a degree of probability which is

commensurate with the occasion. Likewise, a divorce court should

require a degree of probability which is proportionate to the subject-

matter.

The issue in Hornal v. Neuberger Products Ltd. [1957] 1 QB 247 was the

standard of proof in a civil claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. The

Court of Appeal held that the trial judges approach on standard of proof

was correct. Denning L.J. referred back to the views he had articulated

in Bater v. Bater and stated at page 258:

[T]he standard of proof depends on the nature of the issue. The more

serious the allegation the higher the degree of probability that is

required: but it need not, in a civil case, reach the very high standard

required by the criminal law.

Hodson L.J. fully concurred with those views, supplementing them at

page 264:

Just as in civil cases the balance of probability may be more readily

tilted in one case than in another, so in criminal cases proof beyond

reasonable doubt may more readily be attained in some cases than

in others.

Morris L.J. added at page 266:

It is, I think, clear from the authorities that a difference of approach

in civil cases has been recognized. Many judicial utterances show

6

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

this. The phrase balance of probabilities is often employed as a

convenient phrase to express the basis upon which civil issues are

decided. It may well be that no clear-cut logical reconciliation can be

formulated in regard to the authorities on these topics. But perhaps

they illustrate that the life of the law is not logic but experience. In

some criminal cases liberty may be involved; in some it may not. In

some civil cases the issues may involve questions of reputation

which can transcend in importance even questions of personal

liberty. Good name in man or woman is the immediate jewel of their

souls.

But in truth no real mischief results from an acceptance of the fact

that there is some difference of approach in civil actions. Particularly

is this so if the words which are used to define that approach are

the servants but not the masters of meaning. Though no court and

no jury would give less careful attention to issues lacking gravity

than to those marked by it, the very elements of gravity become a

part of the whole range of circumstances which have to be weighed

in the scale when deciding as to the balance of probabilities. This

view was denoted by Denning L.J. when in his judgment in Bater v.

Bater he spoke of a degree of probability which is commensurate

with the occasion and of a degree of probability which is

proportionate to the subject-matter.

In Thomas Bates & Sons v. Wyndhams (Lingerie) Ltd. [1981] 1 All ER 1077

at 1085, Buckley L.J. stated:

I think that the use of a variety of formulations used to express the

degree of certainty with which a particular fact must be established

in civil proceedings is not very helpful and may, indeed, be

confusing. The requite degree of cogency of proof will vary with the

nature of the facts to be established and the circumstances of the

7

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

case. I would say that in civil proceedings a fact must be proved with

that degree of certainty which justice requires in the circumstances

of the particular case. In every case the balance of probability must

be discharged, but in some cases that balance may be more easily

tipped than in others.

A serious allegation necessitates a higher standard of proof compared to

a less weighty claim. In Re H and Others (Minors) [1996] 1 All ER 1, the

case concerned the care of children under the Children Act 1989 of the

United Kingdom. Whilst acknowledging the degrees of the balance of

probabilities, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the House of Lords stated at

pages 16-17:

The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied

an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the

occurrence of the event was more likely than not. When assessing

the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever

extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the

allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the

stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the

allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is

usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is

usually less likely than accidental physical injury. A stepfather is

usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-

consensual oral sex with his under age stepdaughter than on some

occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her. Built into the

preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of

flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.

Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where

a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is

higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability

8

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing

the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event

occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the

evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its

occurrence will be established. Ungoed-Thomas J. expressed this

neatly in In re Dellows Will Trusts [1964] 1 W.L.R. 451, 455: The

more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required

to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.

In R (N) v. Mental Health Review Board (Northern Region) [2006] QB 468,

after an exhaustive review of earlier authorities, the Court of Appeal

firmly held that although there is a single civil standard of proof on the

balance of probabilities, its application is flexible. Richards L.J. at para

62 stated that this flexibility is referable to the quality of evidence

required rather than degrees of probability:

Although there is a single civil standard of proof on the balance of

probabilities, it is flexible in its application. In particular, the more

serious the allegation or the more serious the consequences if the

allegation is proved, the stronger must be the evidence before a court

will find the allegation proved on the balance of probabilities. Thus

the flexibility of the standard lies not in any adjustment to the degree

of probability required for an allegation to be proved (such that a

more serious allegation has to be proved to a higher degree of

probability), but in the strength or quality of the evidence that will in

practice be required for an allegation to be proved on the balance of

probabilities.

9

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

What I endeavored to demonstrate from the above discussion is that the

civil standard of a balance of probabilities is flexible, to be applied with

varying degrees of strictness depending on the gravity of the matter to be

proved.

In an ex parte trial, the plaintiffs evidence remains unchallenged. Hence

there is no necessity to adduce documentary proof for each and every

item of evidence. This is especially true for establishing matters that even

the defendant would not have contested had he appeared in Court to

contest the case. A plaintiff cannot be placed in a disadvantageous

position when the defendant refuses to come to Court in response to

summons. Had the 1st defendant responded to summons and made its

appearance in Court, it is unlikely that it would have contested the

plaintiffs case on the basis that the plaintiff and the 1st defendant are

not incorporated companies.

The senior executive of the plaintiff company in his affidavit evidence

clearly states that they are incorporated companies. P1 and P3 state the

registration number of the plaintiff company as PB 4633. If the 1st

defendant is not an incorporated company, in the event the judgment is

entered against the 1st defendant, the plaintiff will not be able to enforce

the decree.

There is no reason for the learned High Court Judge to dismiss the

plaintiffs action on the basis that certificates of incorporation and

registration of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant have not been tendered

with the affidavit evidence.

If the Court, in fact, had some doubt about the incorporation and

registration of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, the Court should have

sought clarification from the plaintiff rather than unilaterally dismissing

the action in its entirety.

10

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

Section 85(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

85(1) The plaintiff may place evidence before the court in support of

his claim by affidavit, or by oral testimony and move for judgment,

and the court, if satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief

claimed by him, either in its entirety or subject to modification, may

enter such judgment in favour of the plaintiff as to it shall seem

proper, and enter decree accordingly.

In terms of section 85(1), what the plaintiff is required to do at the ex

parte trial is to lead evidence to satisfy the court that he is entitled to the

relief claimed; no higher degree of proof is required. If there is no

satisfactory evidence, the Court shall dismiss the plaintiffs case.

As was observed by Vythialingam J. in De Silva v. De Silva (1974) 77 NLR

554 at 558 The evidence led in an ex parte trial is of the barest minimum.

There is no necessity to lead evidence in an ex parte trial as in a contested

inter partes trial. However, this should not be construed to mean that in

an ex parte trial, the Court, without any consideration of the evidence

adduced, should mechanically enter judgment for the plaintiff.

In the Supreme Court case of The Finance Company PLC v. Thushara and

Others (SC/CHC/APPEAL/5/2012, SC Minutes of 26.01.2017),

Prasanna Jayawardena J. held that, in an ex parte trial, the plaintiff is

only required to present evidence on a prima facie basis, demonstrating

the constituent elements of his cause of action.

When determining whether or not burden of proof has been

discharged in an ex parte trial, it has to be kept in mind that, a

Plaintiff who adduces evidence at an ex parte trial is, usually,

required to adduce only such evidence as is necessary to establish

his case on a prima facie basis by establishing the constituent

11

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

elements of his cause of action. This is subject to the Court seeing

no reason to doubt the authenticity and bona fides of the evidence.

Prima facie evidence means evidence that, on its face and without further

explanation, is sufficient to establish a fact or raise a presumption of fact

unless contradicted or rebutted.

Section 85(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Where the court is of opinion that the entirety of the relief claimed by

the plaintiff cannot be granted, the court shall hear the plaintiff

before modifying the relief claimed.

It is important to note that in terms of section 85(2), if the Court thinks

that the entirety of the claim cannot be granted, it must afford the

plaintiff an opportunity to be heard before modifying the relief claimed.

The Court is not permitted to unilaterally modify the relief based solely

on affidavit evidence. However, if the Court grants the plaintiffs relief in

its entirety, it may unilaterally enter judgment based on affidavit

evidence.

In Brampy v. Peris (1987) 3 NLR 34, the manner of leading evidence in an

ex parte trial was discussed. Lawrie A.C.J. stated at page 36:

[W]hatever be the evidence it must be sufficient to satisfy the Judge,

who is not bound to give a decree until he is satisfied. If he is

dissatisfied, he should in an order point out in what respects the

evidence already recorded is defective and then adjourn either to a

day named or sine die. The plaintiff may put the cause on the roll

when he is able to supplement the defective evidence.

In the same judgment, Browne A.J. stated at page 37:

12

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

But in my opinion plaintiff on the occurrence of any doubt in the mind

of the Judge as to his right to judgment should have opportunity

given him to dispel that doubt ere his action were finally dismissed

to the absolute extinction of his claim for ever, and I cannot see he

had that opportunity here given him. I agree that the dismissal

should be set aside and decree nisi entered for the plaintiff.

When the defendant refuses to come to Court after service of summons

along with a copy of the plaint which contains the claim against him, the

judge need not form defences on behalf of the defaulter unless the judge

is convinced that the plaintiffs claim is baseless.

In Pathmawathie v. Jayasekera [1997] 1 Sri LR 248 at 250, Weerasekera

J. observed:

It must always be remembered by judges that the system of Civil

Law that prevails in our country is confrontational and therefore the

jurisdiction of the judge is circumscribed and limited to the dispute

presented to him for adjudication by the contesting partiesIn that

situation our Civil Law does not in any way permit the adjudicator

or judge the freedom of the wild ass to go on a voyage of discovery

and make a finding as he pleases may be on what he thinks is right

or wrong, moral or immoral or what should be the correct situation.

In the instant case, the plaintiff has led sufficient evidence to prove its

case at the ex parte trial.

Defective proxy

The other reason the learned High Court Judge dismissed the plaintiffs

action is that, on behalf of the plaintiff company, the proxy has been

signed by the Chief Legal Officer of the plaintiff company. The registered

attorney of the plaintiff company is not the said Chief Legal Officer.

13

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

If the plaintiffs proxy is defective, the Court cannot unilaterally dismiss

the plaintiffs action on that ground. A defect in the proxy is not fatal but

rather curable unless there is a positive legal bar.

The question of defective proxy has been addressed in numerous

judgments of the superior Courts.

In Udeshi and Others v. Mather [1988] 1 Sri LR 12, the Supreme Court

authoritatively held that, in the absence of a positive legal bar, the

defective proxy can be cured. Atukorale J. held at page 21:

As pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants, in matters of

this nature the question appears to be whether the proctor had in

fact the authority of his client to do what was done on his behalf

although in pursuance of a defective appointment. If in fact he had

his clients authority to do so, then the defect is one which, in the

absence of any positive legal bar, could be cured. On the contrary if

in fact he did not have such authority of his client, the acts done and

the appearances made on his behalf by the proctor would be void

and of no legal effect. This commends itself to me as the better view.

Accordingly I hold that in the circumstances of this case it was open

to the 8 appellants to cure the defect, if there was any, in the proxies

by tendering fresh proxies ratifying the steps already taken on their

behalf by their attorney-at-law.

Upon review of the majority of previous judgments on the point, in

Gunatilake v. Sunil Ekanayake [2010] 2 Sri LR 191, J.A.N. De Silva C.J.

stated at page 203, the fundamental question to be asked is whether the

proctor had in fact the authority of his client to do what was done although

in pursuance of a defective appointment. In the above case, there was no

proxy at all. But the Supreme Court held that if the Attorney-at-Law had

14

SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015

the authority to appear and make applications on behalf of the party for

whom he appeared, the defect can be cured by filing a proxy.

In the instant case, a proxy was filed. The plaintiff company does not

complain that its Chief Legal Officer or the registered Attorney has acted

without its instructions.

In the course of writing the judgment, if the learned High Court Judge

thought the proxy to be defective, he ought to have drawn it to the

attention of the plaintiff first and thereafter, if necessary, given an

opportunity to rectify the defect of the proxy.

The dismissal of the plaintiffs action unilaterally on the basis that the

proxy is defective is erroneous.

The plaintiff in the instant case has later filed a fresh proxy in the

Commercial High Court.

Conclusion

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court erred on both grounds

upon which he proceeded to dismiss the plaintiffs action after an ex parte

trial. I set aside the judgment appealed from and allow the appeal with

costs.

The Commercial High Court will now enter ex parte decree against all four

defendants as prayed for in the prayer to the plaint.
