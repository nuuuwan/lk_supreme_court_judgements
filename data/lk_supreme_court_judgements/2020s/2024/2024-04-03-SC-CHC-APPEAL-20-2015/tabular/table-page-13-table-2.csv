"authoritatively  held  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  positive  legal  bar,  the"
"defective proxy can be cured. Atukorale J. held at page 21:"
"As pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants, in matters of"
"this  nature  the  question  appears  to  be  whether  the  proctor  had  in"
"fact  the  authority  of  his  client  to  do  what  was  done  on  his  behalf"
"although in pursuance of a defective appointment. If in fact he had"
"his clientâ€™s authority to do so, then the defect is one which, in the"
"absence of any positive legal bar, could be cured. On the contrary if"
"in fact he did not have such authority of his client, the acts done and"
"the appearances made on his behalf by the proctor would be void"
"and of no legal effect. This commends itself to me as the better view."
"Accordingly I hold that in the circumstances of this case it was open"
"to the 8 appellants to cure the defect, if there was any, in the proxies"
"by tendering fresh proxies ratifying the steps already taken on their"
"behalf by their attorney-at-law."
