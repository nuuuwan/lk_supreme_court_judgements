"of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing"
"the  probabilities  and  deciding  whether,  on  balance, 
the  event"
"occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the"
"evidence  that  it did  occur before, on  the  balance of probability, its"
"occurrence  will  be  established.  Ungoed-Thomas  J.  expressed  this"
"neatly in In re Dellow’s Will Trusts [1964] 1 W.L.R. 451, 455: “The"
"more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required"
"to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.”"
