"are equal, it is not."
"Are there degrees of proof within the standard of proof of the balance of"
"probabilities? Theoretically, the answer is in the negative, but practically,"
"such degrees do exist."
"In  Bater  v.  Bater  [1950]  2  All  ER  458,  it  was  held  that  there  may  be"
"degrees  of  probability  within  the  civil  standard  of  proof  of  balance  of"
"probabilities;  the  degree  of  proof  must  be  commensurate  with  the"
"occasion  and  proportionate  to  the  subject-matter.  In  this  case,  wife"
"sought for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The Court of Appeal held that"

"proof”  was  necessary  due  to  the  significance  of  the  case  to  both  the"
"parties involved and the community. Denning L.J. stated at page 459:"
