"Section 85(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:"
"85(1) The plaintiff may place evidence before the court in support of"
"his claim by affidavit, or by oral testimony and move for judgment,"
"and  the  court,  if  satisfied  that  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  the  relief"
"claimed by him, either in its entirety or subject to modification, may"
"enter  such  judgment  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff  as  to  it  shall  seem"
"proper, and enter decree accordingly."
