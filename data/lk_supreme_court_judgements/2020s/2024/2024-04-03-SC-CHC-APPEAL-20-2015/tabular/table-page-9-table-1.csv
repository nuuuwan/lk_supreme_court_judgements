"What I endeavored to demonstrate from the above discussion is that the"
"civil standard of a balance of probabilities is flexible, to be applied with"
"varying degrees of strictness depending on the gravity of the matter to be"
"proved."
"In an ex parte trial, the plaintiff’s evidence remains unchallenged. Hence"
"there  is  no  necessity  to  adduce  documentary  proof  for  each  and  every"
"item of evidence. This is especially true for establishing matters that even"
"the  defendant  would  not  have  contested  had  he  appeared  in  Court  to"
"contest  the  case.  A  plaintiff  cannot  be  placed  in  a  disadvantageous"
"position  when  the  defendant  refuses  to  come  to  Court  in  response  to"
"summons. Had the 1st defendant responded to summons and made its"
"appearance  in  Court,  it  is  unlikely  that  it  would  have  contested  the"
"plaintiff’s case on the basis that the plaintiff and the 1st  defendant are"
"not incorporated companies."
"The  senior  executive  of  the  plaintiff  company  in  his  affidavit  evidence"
"clearly states that they are incorporated companies. P1 and P3 state the"
"registration  number  of  the  plaintiff  company  as  PB  4633.  If  the  1st"
"defendant is not an incorporated company, in the event the judgment is"
"entered against the 1st defendant, the plaintiff will not be able to enforce"
"the decree."
"There  is  no  reason  for  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  dismiss  the"
"plaintiff’s  action  on  the  basis  that  certificates  of 
incorporation  and"
"registration of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant have not been tendered"
"with the affidavit evidence."
"If  the  Court,  in  fact,  had  some  doubt  about  the  incorporation  and"
"registration of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, the Court should have"
"sought clarification from the plaintiff rather than unilaterally dismissing"
"the action in its entirety."
