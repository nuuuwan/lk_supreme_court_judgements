"(f) Has the Court of Appeal erred in fact and in law in holding that the Appellant was"
"in breach of a statutory duty amounting to unfairness and an abuse of power when"
"he did not comply with gazetting the proposed project approved by the TEC?"
"30. In view of the reasoning contained above, which I choose not to repeat, I hold that"
"the 7th Respondent – Appellant had acted in terms of the law in having refrained"
"from publishing  in the  Gazette  the EIA Report  (“P27”). More specifically,  I  hold"
"that  the  7th  Respondent  –  Appellant  had  acted  in  terms  of  the  discretionary"
"authority vested in him, exercised such discretion in an objective and reasonable"
"manner and in the best interests of the State and her People, in having withheld"
"the  grant  of  approval  for  the  proposed  project  of  the  Petitioner  -  Respondents."
"Thus,  I  hold  that  the  finding  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  that  the  Appellant  was  in"
"‘breach of a statutory duty amounting to unfairness and had abused power vested in him"
"by law’, is an error in both fact and law."
"31. It is pertinent to note that, the Writ of Mandamus would not lie in a situation where"
"a public functionary who is empowered by law to perform a certain function, and"
"for  such  purpose  been  vested  with  discretionary  authority,  has  exercised  such"
"authority in good faith, diligently, and within the realm of the purpose for which"
"such discretionary authority has been vested in him, and decided for valid reasons"
"not to perform a particular function which he has been empowered to perform. As"
"held  in  Amerasinghe  v.  Jayathilake,  Director  General  of  Customs  and  Others"
"[2004] 2 Sri L R 169, “No person shall be compelled by mandamus to exercise his discretion"
"one way or other if he has honestly and reasonably exercised his  discretion.” This case"
"reflects such a situation where the 7th Respondent – Appellant has exercised the"
"discretionary authority vested in him by section 23BB(4) of the NEA in a lawful"
"manner. Thus, it was not possible for the Court of Appeal to have issued the Writ"
"of Mandamus on the 7th Respondent – Appellant."
"32. In  this  regard,  it  is  important  in  my  view  to  delve  into  the  law  relating  to  the"
"management  and  regulation  of  exploitation  of  natural  resources,  which  is  the"
"responsibility of the State, executed by its agent - the Geological Survey and Mines"
"Bureau (GSMB). In this regard, the starting point is to note that natural resources"
"such as minerals fall into the category of non-renewable resources. Though natural"
"resources  are  necessary  to  sustain  the  livelihoods  of  people  and  to  facilitate"
"economic  growth,  global  experience  is  that  natural  resources  are  being  over-"
