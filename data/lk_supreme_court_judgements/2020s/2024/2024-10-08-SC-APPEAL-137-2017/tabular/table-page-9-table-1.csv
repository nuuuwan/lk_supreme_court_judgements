"","Subsequently, the Petitioner  – Respondents  amended the  Application seeking a"
"","category ‘A’ Licence."
"","4.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  National  Environmental  Act,  the  project  of  the"
"","Petitioner – Respondents being a ‘prescribed project’, was required to undergo an"
"","Environmental 
Impact  Assessment 
(EIA).  Accordingly, 
for 
the  purpose  of"
"","processing this Application, the GSMB informed the 6th Respondent – Respondent"
"","who is the Director General of the Central Environmental Authority (hereinafter"
"","sometimes  referred  to  as  “the  CEA”)  that  the  proposed  project  needs  to  be"
"","subjected  to  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and  for  that  purpose"
"","requested  that  a  Project  Approving Agency  (PAA)  be  appointed  to  prepare the"
"","Terms of Reference (ToR) of the environmental examination that had to be carried"
"","out. Accordingly, by letter dated 7th February 2005 (“P25”), the CEA appointed the"
"","Forest  Department  as  the  PAA.  Following  a  field  inspection  by  the  relevant"
"","officials, the 7th Respondent – Appellant (Conservator of Forests) in his capacity as"
"","the Head of the Forest Department called upon the Petitioner – Respondents to"
"","carry  out  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  relating  to  the  proposed"
"","project, and submitted the ToR for the EIA."
"","5.  Consequently, in September 2006, the Petitioner – Respondents submitted to the"
"","7th  Respondent  –  Appellant  the  Report  (“P27”)  of  the  EIA  that  was  conducted."
"","Following  an  evaluation  of  the  said  Report, 
in  March  2007,  the  7th  to  10th"
"","Respondents  –  Respondents  (an  Environmental  Officer  of  the  CEA,  a  Deputy"
"","Conservator of Forests, and two officers of the GSMB, respectively) recommended"
"","the approval of the EIA, and such outcome was conveyed by the 7th Respondent –"
"","Appellant to the Petitioner - Respondents."
"6.  The  Petitioner  –  Respondents","claimed  before 
the  Court  of  Appeal 
that,"
"","notwithstanding the approval granted to the EIA, the 7th Respondent – Appellant"
"","refrained  from  publishing  the  EIA  Report  (“P27”)  in  the  Gazette  under  section"
"","23BB(4) of the National Environmental Act. The Petitioner – Respondents alleged"
"","that 
the 
7th  Respondent 
–  Appellant’s 
refusal 
to 
publish 
“P27”,  was"
"","notwithstanding several requests by them and a letter of demand being submitted"
"","by an Attorney-at-Law on their behalf."
"7.","In this backdrop, the Petitioner – Respondents complained to the Court of Appeal"
"","regarding (i) the arbitrary failure on the part of the 7th Respondent – Appellant to"
"","publish “P27” in the Gazette, and (ii) for having failed to give reasons in respect of"
