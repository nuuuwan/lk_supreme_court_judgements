"[1996] SC 711, the Supreme Court of India has held the following:"
"“…  The  State  is  the  trustee  of  all  natural  resources  which  are  by  nature  meant  for"
"public  use  and  enjoyment.  Public  at  large  is  the  beneficiary  the  sea-shore,  running"
"waters, airs, forests and ecologically fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a legal"
"duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public use cannot be"
"converted into private ownership.  The esthetic use  and the pristine glory of  natural"
"resources, the environment and the eco-systems of our country cannot be permitted to"
"erode for private, commercial or any other use unless the court finds it necessary, in"
"good  faith,  for  the  public  good,  and  in  public  interest  to  encroach  upon  the  said"
"resources.”"
