It  is  not  clear  whether  the  mining  method  (vertical  slicing)  which  is"
"","intended to be adopted during the underground mining operation for"
"","iron ore would cause effects of vibration with the possibility of causing"
"","damage  to  nearby  houses.  Further,  whenever  blasting  activities  are"
"","carried out, considerable damage would be caused to the forest and to"
"","the fauna and flora in the forest. The project proponent should site case"
"","studies  from  other  countries  to  show  that  the  intended  method  of"
"","mining would not cause such consequences."
"","c.  The EIA Report does not contain a consideration of the disturbing effects"
"","to the wildlife of the area (due to sound emanating from machinery to"
"","be used in the mining operation which would exceed 50 Db (A), which"
"","is the daytime upper limit with regard to noise pollution in respect of"
"","sensitive  eco-systems)  and  possible  mitigatory  measures  that  may  be"
"","taken in that regard."

Issues associated with soil erosion have not been considered and there"

"","e.  The  Report  does  not  contain  reference  to  a  proper  restoration  and"

"I","n  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  Environmental  Foundation  Limited  has  proposed"

"","EIA Report:"
"","a.  A proper study has not been conducted to ascertain the actual size of"
"","the magnetite deposits in the area."
"","b.  The  exportation  of  raw  iron  ore  without  any  value  addition  causes"
"","economic loss to the country."
"","c.  The  EIA  Report  has  been  prepared  for  a  mere  business  purpose,  and"
