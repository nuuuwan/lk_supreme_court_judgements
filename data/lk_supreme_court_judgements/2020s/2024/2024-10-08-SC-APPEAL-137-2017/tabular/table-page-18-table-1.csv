"","d.  The EIA Report makes no reference to the possibility of other minerals"
"","being associated and existing with the magnetite deposits."
"","e.  The  proposed  mining  site  will  be  situated  across  a  corridor  presently"
"","being  used  by  approximately  150  elephants,  that  regularly  access  the"
"","nearby Handapanagala reservoir. In the circumstances, once the mining"
"","work commences, the existing human – elephant conflict in the area will"
"","intensify and the ensuing consequences will be very serious."
"xxi.","On 27th December 2006, the 7th Respondent – Appellant had received a letter"
"","from Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Monaragala District, Padma"
"","Udaya  Shantha  Gunasekara  (“R1C”)  objecting  to  the  EIA  Report  and  the"
"","proposed  magnetite  mining  project  of  the  Petitioner  –  Respondents.  His"
"","objections were founded upon the following:"
"","a.  The amended EIA does not adequately address objections raised at the"
"","public hearing."
"","b.  The proposed project will result in magnetite being exported from the"
"","country in its raw form, and thereby causing considerable economic loss"
"","to the country."
"","c.  Magnetite deposits which can be used for another 100 – 150 years will"
"","be exhausted within a short period of 4 years."
"","d.  The  EIA Report does not contain any reference to other minerals that"
"","may be associated with magnetite and the associated soil that is to be"
"","mined and excavated."
"","e.  The  Handapanagala  reservoir  is  situated  in  close  proximity  to  the"
"","proposed mining site. The lives of 2,000 families are depended upon this"
"","reservoir.  The  EIA  Report  does  not  contain  a  detailed 
reference"
"","regarding  the  possible  effects  of  the  proposed  mining  activity  on  this"
"","reservoir."
"xxii.","Similarly, on 28th December 2006, the 7th Respondent – Appellant had received"
"","a representation from the Green Movement of Sri Lanka (“R1A”) relating to the"
"","proposed project of the Petitioner – Respondents stating inter alia that;"
"","a.  mineral deposits are not renewable resources, and thus they have a high"
"","value,"
"","b. 
the  government  being  the  trustee  of  natural  resources  has  a  duty  to"
"","protect such resources for the benefit of future generations,"
"","c. 
the government must mobilise mineral resources for the welfare of the"
"","public,"
