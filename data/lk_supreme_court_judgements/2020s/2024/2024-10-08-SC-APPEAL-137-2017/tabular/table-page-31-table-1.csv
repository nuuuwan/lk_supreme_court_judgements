"respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of"
"the corpus of international law relating to the environment‚Äù. States must bear in mind"
"possible collateral adverse impacts arising out of the use of natural resources on"
"the entire global environment and particularly on the common good of the entire"
"human race. Thus, the need to respect the use of natural resources of one country"
"are  subject  to  their  transnational  border  implications.  Therefore,  the  use  of  the"
"natural  resources  of  one  country  must  be  subject  to  transgenerational  equity,"
"which  arises  out  of  the  impact  the  exploitation  of  the  natural  resources  of  one"
"country may have on the global environment and the lives of  human beings of"
"other countries. The use of natural resources subject to transgenerational equity is a"
"matter to be regulated by International Law."
