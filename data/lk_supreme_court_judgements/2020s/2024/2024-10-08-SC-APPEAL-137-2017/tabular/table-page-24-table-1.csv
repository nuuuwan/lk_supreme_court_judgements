"Approving  Agency  (the  Head  of  which","is  the  7th  Respondent  –  Appellant)"
"","discretionary authority in determining whether or not approval should be granted"
"","to a particular proposed project. The Project Approving Agency is not expected to"
"","act in a perfunctory manner. Doing so would be unlawful. In the circumstances, I"
"","am  unable  to  accept  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  –"
"","Respondent that ‘in the event the Petitioners submitted such an EIA, the 7th Respondent"
"","was obliged to gazette the said EIA in accordance with section 23BB(4) of the NEA’."
"","25. Indeed, it is important to note that the exercise of discretionary authority should"
"","be founded upon application of criteria which are relevant and necessary, applied"
"","and determined objectively, and decided upon in good faith and with due diligence."
"","The decision arrived at by the 7th Respondent – Appellant on behalf of the Project"
"Approving  Agency 
(Forest  Department)  should  be","founded  upon  diligent"
"","enquiry, objective assessment of the merits, and must be reasonable. Reasons for"
"","the decision must be recorded contemporaneously with the decision being taken."
"","The  duty  to  publish  in  the  Gazette  arises  only  if  the  Project  Approving  Agency"
"","decides to grant approval to a prescribed project. In this instance, the necessity to"
"","do so did not arise, since the 7th Respondent – Appellant had not decided to grant"
"","approval, and had rightfully decided to take certain other steps which would have"
"","enabled  him  to  decide  on  whether  or  not  to  grant  approval  for  the  proposed"
"","project.  Thus,  the  entitlement  of  the  project  proponent  to  have  its  EIA  Report"
"","published  in  the  Gazette  is  not  unqualified,  and  is  subject  to  these  processes"
"recognised by law.",""
"","26. The  evidence  elucidated  above,  clearly reveals  that  upon  the  receipt  of  the  EIA"
"","Report,  the  7th  Respondent  –  Appellant  had  forwarded  it  to  the  TEC  and  had"
"","awaited its Report. Following the receipt of the TEC Report, the 7th Respondent –"
"","Appellant had acted in terms of a critical decision contained therein, which related"
"","to State policy, pertaining to whether or not the State should permit iron ore to be"
"","exported  in  its  raw  form  (without  any  value  addition).  The  response  he  had"
"","received from the 4th Respondent – Secretary to the Ministry of Environment and"
"","Natural Resources had been in the negative. Furthermore, it is evident that the 7th"
"","Respondent – Appellant had received a spate of representations from concerned"
"","civil society organisations and from a Member of Parliament  (MP)  representing"
"","the Monaragala District. Thus, there was ample justification for the 7th Respondent"
"","– Appellant in deciding to withhold the grant of approval for the proposed project"
"","of the Petitioner – Respondents, pending further inquiry. Had he not done so, his"
"","conduct would have been contrary to the legal principles enunciated by this Court"
