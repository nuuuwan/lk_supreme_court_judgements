"development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature."
"… In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute"
"an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it."

"encapsulated  in  the  phrase  ‘sustainable  development’,  namely  that  human  development"
"and the use of natural resources must take place in a sustainable manner. … humankind"
"bears  a  solemn  responsibility  to  protect  and  improve  the  environment  for  present  and"
"future generations. … The non-renewable resources of the earth must be employed in such"
"a way as to guard against their future exhaustion and to ensure that benefits from such"
"employment are shared by all humankind. … ”."
