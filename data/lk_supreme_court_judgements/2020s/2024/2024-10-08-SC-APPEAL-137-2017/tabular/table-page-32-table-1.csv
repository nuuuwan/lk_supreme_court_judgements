"it must be appreciated that Sri Lankaâ€™s law recognises the legal principle of intra-"
"generational equity."
"44. Intra-generational  equity  is  the  equitable  right  of  all  persons  of  the  present"
"generation  to  access  and  benefit  from  inter-alia  the  natural  resources  of  the"
"country, while recognising the need and providing for inter-generational equity."
"In  as  much  as  inter-generational  equity  is  a  component  of  the  right  to  equality"
"recognised  by  Article  12(1)  of  the  Constitution,  intra-generational  equity  is  yet"
"another manifestation of the fundamental right to equality."
"45. Therefore,  the  Executive  branch  of  the  State  entrusted  with  the  task  of  having"
"custody  of  natural  resources  and  managing  and  regulating  the  use  of  natural"
"resources, cannot exercise the powers of management and regulation of the use of"
"natural resources, to usher benefit only to a chosen few. The Executive has the duty"
"to permit all people to gain equitable access to natural resources, and  to ensure"
"that the People as a whole are benefitted from such riches. The Executive must also"
"ensure that  individuals  of the  community  are  benefitted  from such riches in an"
"equitable manner."
