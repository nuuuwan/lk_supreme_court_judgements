To the Application was attached inter alia a Report containing the findings of the exploratory work conducted under the authority of the exploration licence (P20). vi.

By letter dated 7th February 2005, the 6th Respondent Respondent (Director General, CEA) notified the 7th Respondent Appellant Sarath Fernando, Conservator of Forests of this matter. It was brought to his attention that as stipulated in Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 772/22 of 18th June 1993, the proposed project (mining of minerals) is a prescribed project as it falls within the projects and undertakings for which approval shall be necessary under provisions of Part IV(C) of the National Environmental Act. As such, in terms of section 23BB(1) of the National Environmental Act, it was necessary that a Report of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) / Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) be prepared by the project proponent before considering the grant of approval. Since the project area came within the purview of the Forest Department, the Director General of the CEA opined that it will be appropriate if the Forest Department were to function as the Project Approving Agency (PAA) for the EIA / IEE process. Therefore, the Conservator of Forests was requested to prepare the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the EIA / IEE (P25).",

EIAs are intended to foster sound decision-making, not to generate paperwork. The EIA process should also help public officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences, and take actions that protect, restore and enhance the environment.

The decision arrived at by the 7th Respondent Appellant on behalf of the Project Approving Agency (Forest Department) should be founded upon diligent enquiry, objective assessment of the merits, and must be reasonable. Reasons for the decision must be recorded contemporaneously with the decision being taken. The duty to publish in the Gazette arises only if the Project Approving Agency decides to grant approval to a prescribed project. In this instance, the necessity to do so did not arise, since the 7th Respondent Appellant had not decided to grant approval, and had rightfully decided to take certain other steps which would have enabled him to decide on whether or not to grant approval for the proposed project. Thus, the entitlement of the project proponent to have its EIA Report published in the Gazette is not unqualified, and is subject to these processes recognised by law.",

The response he had received from the 4th Respondent Secretary to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources had been in the negative. Furthermore, it is evident that the 7th Respondent Appellant had received a spate of representations from concerned civil society organisations and from a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Monaragala District. Thus, there was ample justification for the 7th Respondent Appellant in deciding to withhold the grant of approval for the proposed project of the Petitioner Respondents, pending further inquiry.

This becomes critical, particularly because the 1st Respondent GSMB when it forwarded the request for a mining licence presented to it by the Petitioner Respondent to the CEA, it does not seem to have applied any of those legal principles. This is troubling because the GSMB is in fact the trustee and custodian agency of the State of the natural mineral resources of Sri Lanka. This is in view of the fact that in terms of section 12(d) of the Mines and Minerals Act, the GSMB is entrusted with the task of regulating by the issue of licenses the exploration and mining of minerals and processing, transporting, storing, trading in and exporting of such minerals. When the Petitioner Respondents preferred an Application for a commercial mining licence, prior to forwarding the matter to the CEA which was for the purpose of applying and enforcing provisions of the National Environmental Act to the proposed project, it was the responsibility of the GSMB to have considered whether a mining licence should be issued for the proposed project. That is, even if environmental clearance was to be issued by the CEA and by the relevant Project Approving Agency. The evidence placed before the Court of Appeal does not reveal the GSMB having performed that legal duty.",

The Constitution in Article 27(4) of the directive principles of state policy enjoins the state to protect, preserve and improve the environment. Article 28 refers to the fundamental duty upon every person in Sri Lanka to protect nature and conserve its riches. Correspondingly, courts in Sri Lanka, have long since recognized that the organs of state are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people. This recognition of the doctrine of public trust, accords a great responsibility upon the government to preserve and protect the environment and its resources. The power of the state and public servants to grant or refuse licences and take suitable action for the protection and conservation of both the environment and natural resources is derived from its status as a public trustee. In this capacity state officials have a paramount duty to serve as a safeguard against private and",

The land belongs to the people and all living beings; thou art only the guardian of it.\"], Judge Weeramantry has while accentuating the first principle of environmental law - the principle of trusteeship of resources of the earth, observed that while the land belongs to the people and to all other living beings, the King or the ruler is only the guardian of it. Thus, recognising the public trust doctrine, he envisages that natural resources of the State are to be protected and preserved for the benefit and best interests of the present, as well as for the future generations.",
