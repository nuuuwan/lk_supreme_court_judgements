"Second Cause of Action"
"The  Respondent  contended  that  pursuant  to  a  request  made  by  the  Appellant,  the"
"Respondent lent and advanced a sum of DEM 23,298/- by providing the Appellant with"
"a letter of credit for the said sum to enable it to import six oil burners."
"Appellant  in  response  notes  that  the  letter  dated  04.11.1997  (P14)  was  merely  a"
"covering letter to a set of documents sent to the  bank and does not prove that the"
"letter of credit was opened by the Respondent or that any funding was provided by the"
"Respondent to the Defendant."
"It is notable that the Managing Director of the Respondent company had been issued"
"a  ‘carbon  copy’  as  reflected  at  the  bottom  of  the  letter.  In  Parr  Construction  Co.  v."
"Pomer [217 Md. 539, 144 A. 2d 69 (1958) at 542], it was held that “[a] carbon copy of"
"a  letter  is  considered  to  be  a  duplicate  original;  and,  as  such,  it  constitutes  primary"
"rather  than  secondary  evidence”.  In  any  case,  the  Respondent’s  witness,  the  Bank"
"Manager of the Hatton National Bank, Mattakkuliya branch presented the document"
"marked  P14(a)  which  had  the  Appellant’s  Deputy  General  Manager’s  signature."
"The  authenticity  of  the 
letter 
in  question  could  have  been  verified  through  the"
"testimony  of  Mr.  Nadarajah  Premakumar,  the  Bank  Manager.  However,  the  full"
"evidence  provided  by  Mr.  Premakumar  is  not  available  to  this  Court;  only  his  re-"
"examination has been presented. Consequently, on 20.05.2022, this Court directed the"
"parties to submit a complete copy of Mr. Premakumar's testimony. The journal entry"
"from  that  date  further  noted  that 
if  the  proceedings  could  not  be 
located  and"
"submitted, the Court would rely on the available evidence on record."
"The  Respondent’s  witness  was  subjected  to  cross-examination,  during  which  the"
"Appellant did not challenge the witness regarding the sum of DEM 23,298/- provided"
"by the Respondent to the Appellant."
