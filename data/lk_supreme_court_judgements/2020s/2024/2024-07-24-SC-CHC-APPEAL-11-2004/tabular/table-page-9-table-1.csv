"An  important  requirement  for  novation  to  be  effective  was  the  existence  of  the"
"intention  to  novate 
(animus  novandi).  This  requirement  appears  to  have  been"
"introduced  by  Justinian  as  Gaius  does  not  refer  to  this  requirement. 
It  was  also"
"necessary that novation is only to take place when the parties have expressly stated"
"that they have made the new agreement with the intention of novating the first. In the"
"absence  of  either  one  of  these  two  factors  there  was  no  novation.  Nevertheless,"
"Nicholas [supra.] states that if novation was made only by a change of debtors, the"
"original debtor could not be prejudiced by the extinction of his debt, and his consent"
"was therefore not necessary."
"The concept of novation in Roman-Dutch Law is described by Wille [Willeâ€™s Principles"
"of South African Law, Hutchinson, Van Heerden, Visser and Van Der Merve (eds.), 8th"
"ed., (Juta & Co. Ltd.), 2003, page 487] as follows:"
