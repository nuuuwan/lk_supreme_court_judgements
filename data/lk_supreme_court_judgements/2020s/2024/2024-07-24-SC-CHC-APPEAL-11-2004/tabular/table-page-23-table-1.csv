"I am disposed to agree with Justice Samayawardhenaâ€™s reasoning that an inference of"
"novation  in  the  absence  of  express  agreement  requires  strong,  robust  evidence  to"
"support it. In the independent facts, circumstances and weight of submitted evidence"
"of  this  instant  case,  such  an  inference  of  novation  can  be  drawn  on  a  balance  of"
"probabilities."
"Thus, the appeal should be dismissed with costs."
