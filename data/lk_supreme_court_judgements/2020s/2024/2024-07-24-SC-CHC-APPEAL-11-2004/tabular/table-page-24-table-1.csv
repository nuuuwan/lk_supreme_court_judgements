"(SC/CHC/APPEAL/03/2012,  SC  Minutes  of  12.02.2024),  in  order  to  decide  whether"
"there is a novation of the old agreement, the use of terms by parties are not decisive."
"I  am  not  in  favour  of  conflating  the  concept  of  novation  with  concepts  such  as"
"assignment, delegation or cession."
"Normally, novation is raised as a defence. In this case, the respondent filed the case"
"against the appellant to recover more than 130 million with interest on the basis that"
"there is a novation. The appellant was not a party to the original contract. However, on"
"the balance of probabilities, the respondent proved that the appellant is liable to pay."
