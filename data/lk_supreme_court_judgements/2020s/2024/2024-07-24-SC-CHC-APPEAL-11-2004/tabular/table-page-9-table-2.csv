"of South African Law, Hutchinson, Van Heerden, Visser and Van Der Merve (eds.), 8th"
"ed., (Juta & Co. Ltd.), 2003, page 487] as follows:"
"“The  term  ‘novation’,  used 
in  a  wide  sense,  means  a  new  contract  which"
"extinguishes  the  original  obligation  between  the  parties  and  replaces  it  by  a"
"fresh  obligation.  There  are  many  varieties  of  novation 
in  the  wide  sense,"
"depending on whether the original parties alone are parties to the new contract,"
"in which case the novation is called ‘novation proper’; or whether a new debtor"
"is substituted for the old debtor, called ‘delegation’; or whether a new person is"
"substituted  for  one  of  the  original  parties  both  as  creditor  and  debtor,  called"
"‘assignment’. […] In all cases of novation the parties to the original agreement"
"must agree to the new contract and if third parties are substituted they must"
"also agree.”"
