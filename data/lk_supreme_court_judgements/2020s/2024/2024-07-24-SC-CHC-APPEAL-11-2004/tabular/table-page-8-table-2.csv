"“[…]  novation  might  assume  several  forms.  It  might  consist  merely  in  the"
"substitution  of the  formal stipulation for  another kind of obligation, as,  for"
"example,  for  a  liability  arising  from  a  contract  of  sale.  It  might  vary  the"
"substance of an existence obligation, as by adding or taking away a condition"
"or a time limit or a surety. Lastly, it might take the form of substituting a new"
"creditor or a new debtor. […] The substitution of a creditor could not take place"
"without the consent of all three parties; but a new debtor might be substituted"
"without  the  consent  of  the  old  one.  For,  just  as  I  can  discharge  your  debt  by"
"payment without your knowledge or consent, so I can discharge it by substituted"
"agreement without your knowledge or consent. ” (emphasis added)"
