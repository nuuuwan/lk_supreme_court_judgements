"There is no express evidence of TPG agreeing to the variation of the MOU. However, in"
"Karthikesu v. Ponnachchy [14 N.L.R. 486 at 487] Lascelles C.J. held:"
"“Novation may take place, not only by express agreement, but also tacit or by"
"implication, the consent of the parties to the novatio being implied from the"
"circumstances and the conduct of the parties. In the latter event, however, the"
"inference must be so probable and conclusive as to make it quite clear that the"
"parties intended to  recede from the original obligation and  to replace it by"
"another - in fact, it must be a necessary inference, the  new obligation being"
"inconsistent  and  incompatible  with  the  continued  existence  of  the  original"
"obligation.” (emphasis added)"
