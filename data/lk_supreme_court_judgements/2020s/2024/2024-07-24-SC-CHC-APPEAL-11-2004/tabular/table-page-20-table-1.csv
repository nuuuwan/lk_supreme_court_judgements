"This part of his evidence was not challenged and  the learned High Court Judge  was"
"entitled to act on this prima facie evidence which became cogent and overwhelming"
"evidence by reason of the failure to contradict the witness and by the failure to lead"
"evidence in rebuttal."
"The Appellant has advanced an argument that the matter must be governed by English"
"law as it qualifies to be a matter under the term ‘corporations’ pursuant to Section 3"
"of  the  Introduction  of  Laws  of  England  Ordinance,  No.  5  of  1852.  This  argument  is"
"redundant  as  was  pointed  out  by  the  Privy  Council  in  De  Silva  v.  Hirdaramani  Ltd."
"[supra]. Moreover, the concept novation is considered to be a part of the modern law"
"of contracts in both English and Roman-Dutch laws [Ran Banda and Others v. People’s"
"Bank [2004] 2 Sri. L. R. 31 at 33-34]."
"In the present case, the Respondent sought to recover the monies advanced to the"
"Appellant. The Appellant consistently indicated in its letters to the Respondent that it"
"regarded  the  Rs.  130  million  as  a  loan  and  would  endeavor  to  repay  it.  The  MOU"
"involved the formation of a Holding Company and the conversion of debentures into"
"shares of that company. Consequently, from the correspondence marked P5 to P11, it"
"can be inferred that both parties intended to treat the payment as a loan."
"The totality of the evidence has proved on a balance of probability that the Appellant"
"received a sum of Rs. 130 Million from the Respondent and that the parties had later"
"agreed to treat it as a loan given to the Appellant by the Respondent. The Appellant"
"failed to repay the loan as agreed. The learned Judge correctly concluded that a sum"
"of Rs. 130 Million and interest thereon as pleaded by the Respondent is due and owing"
"from  the  Appellant.  There  are  no  grounds  to  interfere  with  these  findings  of  the"
"learned Judge of the Commercial High Court."
