"In De Silva v. Hirdaramani Ltd. [56 N.L.R. 481 at 488] it was held that:"
"“[…] the names given to different kinds of novation in Roman-Dutch law and in"
"other  systems  of  law  drawing  on  the  civil  law  are  a  convenient  means  of"
"classifying different kinds of transaction but, […], introduce no principle which"
"would not equally operate in similar circumstances under the law of contract in"
"England.”"
