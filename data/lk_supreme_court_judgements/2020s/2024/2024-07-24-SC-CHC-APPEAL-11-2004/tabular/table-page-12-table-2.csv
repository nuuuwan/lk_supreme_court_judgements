"a company letterhead, letter to the Chairman of the Respondent (P5) referring to the"
"funds advanced to the Appellant by the Respondent. P5 reads as follows:"
"â€œI refer to the several discussions you and your fellow directors/officers had with us in"
"the  recent  past  with  regard  to  the  funds  advanced  to  our  company  by  the  Comany"
"Group. Even at this stage, I feel that to abide by the agreement we have reached signed"
"and sealed is the best course of action for all the parties. This would have prevented all"
"the  needless  disputes  and  the  misunderstandings,  which  are  not  in  the  interest  of"
"anybody."
"However, since you have now decided not to go ahead with the terms in the M.O.U.,"
