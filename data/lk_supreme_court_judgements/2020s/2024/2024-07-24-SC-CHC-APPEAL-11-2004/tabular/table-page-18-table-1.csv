"In Musst Holdings Ltd. v. Astra Asset Management UK Ltd. & Another [(2023) EWCA"
"Civ.  128  at  para.  56],  it  was  held  that  “[t]he  consent  of  all  parties  is  required  for  a"
"novation. Consent can either be provided expressly or can be inferred from conduct."
"Whether consent has been provided is a question of fact”."
"Novation  exists  to  give  business  efficacy  to  the  relationship  between  parties  in  a"

"arrangement was agreed between the parties due to business efficacy."
"Moreover, this communication clearly establishes that there was a novation involving"
