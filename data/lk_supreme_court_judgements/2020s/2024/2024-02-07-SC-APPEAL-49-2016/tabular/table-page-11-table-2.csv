"The learned Judge has relied on the case of Rasamany v. Subramaniam,8 where His"
"Lordship Basnayake J observed as follows:"
"“In my view section 2 should be given a wide meaning and not restricted in its"
"scope  to  persons  having  an  income  or  actually  earning  at  the  time  of  the"
"application. In this context the word "" means "" should be taken to include capacity"
"to earn money. It cannot be that the legislature when enacting these provisions"
"intended to exclude from the scope of sections 2 and 3 able-bodied men capable"
"of earning and maintaining their wives and children but who by their voluntary"
"act refrain from so doing.”9"
