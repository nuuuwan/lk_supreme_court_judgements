The Applicant-Appellant-Respondent, namely Pilawala Pathirennehelage Upeksha

Erandathi, (Hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-Respondent) had filed an

application before the Magistrate Court of Polgahawela on 5th January 2012 against

the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant, namely, Dasanayake Achchilage Dammika

Kumara Dasanayake (Hereinafter referred to as the Respondent-Appellant), to whom

she was married from 24th September 2009, praying for a sum of Rs. 10, 000/- as

maintenance in terms of Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999.

Respondent-Appellant claimed that he did not have sufficient income or assets to pay

the same and prayed for the dismissal of the Applicant-Respondent's application. The

Magistrate Court delivered the order on 23rd May 2014 and dismissed the application

of the Applicant-Respondent.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Applicant-Respondent then appealed to the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province Holden in Kurunegala. By judgment

dated 27th January 2016, the learned High Court Judge held in favour of the Applicant-

Respondent and the Respondent-Appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 7,500/- monthly as

maintenance from January 2012. Aggrieved by the said decision of the learned High

Court Judge, the Respondent-Appellant filed the instant application before this Court.

Initially, the Attorney-at-Law for the Respondent-Appellant identified the following

questions of law:

1. To what extent is an Appellate Judge entitled to disturb a trial judges finding

which was based on testimonial trustworthiness?

2. Can a Court consider unmarked documents filed with the written submissions?

3. Is the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999 a consolidating or codifying Act?

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 12

When the case was taken up on 14th February 2023, the Counsel for the Respondent-

Appellant submitted that he wished to confine himself to the aforementioned second

question of law.

The Factual Background of the Case

According to the Applicant-Respondent, the Applicant-Respondent and Respondent-

Appellant, who had been a Navy deserter unbeknownst to her at the time, registered

their marriage on 24th September 2009 as a result of a romantic relationship. Following

the marriage, they had relocated to Australia, where they were employed in various

capacities for about two years.

The Applicant-Respondent asserted that she pursued a Diploma during this period

while enduring severe mistreatment, characterized by beating and forceful

appropriation of money she had earned. The Applicant-Respondent further claims that

the Respondent-Appellant was addicted to unnatural sexual behaviour, which she

could not tolerate. The Applicant-Respondent claimed that when she refused to

engage in such unnatural sexual behaviours, he would resort to physical violence and

beat her.

The Applicant-Respondent and the Respondent-Appellant had returned to Sri Lanka

on 2nd November 2011. The Applicant-Respondent asserted that her inability to endure

the harsh treatment within the confines of married life, coupled with genuine concerns

for her personal safety, prompted her to file a complaint at the Katunayake Airport

Police after her arrival. Thereafter, she had filed two further complaints dated 03rd

November 2011 and 6th November 2011 at the Alawwa Police Station, having chosen

to reside with her parents in the said area for her safety.

The Applicant-Respondent had subsequently initiated divorce proceedings bearing

Case No. 10408/Divorce at the District Court of Kurunegala. Within the context of these

legal proceedings, the Applicant-Respondent contended that the Respondent-

Appellant, through fraudulent means, acquired funds belonging to her. She asserted

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 12

that she has been left with only the clothes she is wearing, as the Petitioner allegedly

obtained all other assets and belongings.

The Applicant-Respondent further stated that she had not been employed since she

returned to Sri Lanka and that she has been living with her parents with no income.

The position of the Respondent-Appellant throughout these proceedings has been

that he does not have sufficient means and all that he earned while in Australia was

used to pay back his debts. He further asserted that the Applicant-Respondent has a

good earning capacity considering her educational background and strong command

of the English language.

Analysis

The question of law to be considered in the instant case is, simply, whether or not a

judge is able to consider unmarked documents filed with written submissions as

evidence.

Where unmarked documents are considered by a judge in arriving at his or her

decision, especially when such documents are submitted at a later stage of a case, a

party may be prejudiced where such party is not afforded sufficient time and

opportunity to answer or explain the contents of such document. Where prejudice is

so caused, an appellate court is left with no option but to interfere with the findings of

the original court.

Then, what this Court needs to inquire into are the following:

1. Whether or not the learned High Court Judge has considered any unmarked

documents in arriving at his findings; and

2. If the answer to the above is positive, then whether such documents being

considered has affected the outcome of the case, thereby causing prejudice.

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 12

The unmarked document referred to in the instant case is the Medico-Legal Report

dated 6th November 2011, which was submitted as evidence in the aforementioned

divorce proceedings bearing Case No. 10408/Divorce before the District Court of

Kurunegala. Despite the Applicant-Respondents plea for the same to be adopted in

the maintenance proceedings, the record reveals that the learned Magistrate has

unequivocally rejected this plea.1 The learned High Court judge in his judgment dated

27th January 2016 has not once mentioned the Medico-Legal Report.

Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999 provides as follows:

Where any person having sufficient means, neglects or unreasonably refuses to

maintain such person's spouse who is unable to maintain himself or herself, the

Magistrate may, upon an application being made for maintenance, and upon

proof of such neglect or unreasonable refusal, order such person to make a

monthly allowance for the maintenance of such spouse at such monthly rate as

the Magistrate thinks fit, having regard to the income of such person and the

means and circumstances of such spouse:

Provided however, that no such order shall be made if the applicant spouse is

living in adultery or both the spouses are living separately by mutual consent.

According to the aforementioned provision, in making an order for maintenance, a

Magistrate must satisfy himself/herself as to the following elements:

i. The person against whom the claim is made has sufficient means;

ii. Such person neglects or unreasonably refuses to maintain his/her spouse;

iii. The spouse is unable to maintain herself/himself; and

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 12

iv. The case does not fall within the proviso therein, i.e. the spouse is not

living in adultery and the spouses are not living separately by mutual

consent.2

Once a Magistrate is satisfied with all said elements, an order to pay a monthly

allowance for the maintenance of the spouse can be made against such a person.

Although this allowance can be made at a rate as the Magistrate thinks fit, such rate

must be decided having considered the income of the person and the means and

circumstances of the spouse.

The learned High Court Judge, in his judgment dated 27th January 2016, has first

dispensed with the question with regards to the proviso. In that, the question of

adultery has been correctly dismissed for there is no allegation of adultery against the

Applicant-Respondent. Even where such an allegation is made the burden of proving

the same would be on the person who alleges it.3

In considering whether there has been a mutual separation, the learned Magistrate has

considered the allegations of unnatural sexual behaviour in the following manner, and

the same has been accepted by the learned High Court Judge:

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 12

[However, as the same has not been refuted on behalf of the Respondent or by

the evidence of the Respondent, by virtue of the decision in Dadimuni

Wimalasena v. Attorney-General, there is no impediment to considering the fact

that there had been unnatural sexual behaviour with the Applicant as an

admission, and, as such, due to these sexual harassments the Applicant had had

to separate from him and it is revealed that there are reasonable grounds to

refuse his invitation to resume their marital life.]4

Although she has only made this allegation to Katunayake Police after returning to Sri

Lanka after a considerable delay without ever informing the authorities in Australia,

this need not affect her testimonial creditworthiness. It is naturally difficult for anyone

subjected to such treatment to muster up the courage to voice out their concerns

especially when living in a foreign country, far away from anyone who may lend a

shoulder. After arriving in Sri Lanka, she has expeditiously informed the police of her

ordeal, which the learned High Court Judge has taken into account in assessing her

evidence.5

The decision of the learned Magistrate in refusing to make an order concerning the

payment of maintenance was mainly based on his finding that the Respondent-

Appellant did not have sufficient means. The learned Magistrate had further concluded

the Applicant-Respondent to have a higher earning capacity compared to the

Respondent-Appellant and that she was able to maintain herself.

The learned High Court Judge has analysed the ability of the Applicant-Respondent to

maintain herself in the following manner:

[The magistrate has stated in his order that "in the analysis of the testimony of

the petitioner, it seems that efforts have been made to point out that she is

helpless with some exaggeration". It was so found as the witness had said that

she wears her sister's clothes because she has no income or is unable to afford

even clothing items. Here, although the magistrate has said that she cannot reach

such a level considering the assets of the father, there is no legal requirement to

consider the assets of the parents in an application of this nature. Therefore, a

decision made on such a basis cannot be deemed accurate]6

I am inclined to agree with the findings of the learned High Court Judge. The assets of

her parents, or any relative for that matter, cannot be considered her own means,

although parents and relatives may naturally lend a hand. The means and

circumstances of relatives cannot release a spouse from the responsibility of

maintaining the other.

Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge has arrived at a different conclusion to that

of the learned Magistrate in assessing whether the Respondent-Appellant has

sufficient means. The learned High Court Judge has arrived at his conclusion based on

6 Judgment dated 27th January 2016 of the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province Case No. HCA 70/2014 at p. 15 [An approximate translation added]

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 12

the testimonial creditworthiness of the evidence produced before the Magistrate on

behalf of the Respondent-Appellantthe overall improbability of the evidence was

considered in particular.

The Respondent-Appellant had submitted that he had no sufficient means of

maintaining his spouse owing to being unemployed and having to spend the entirety

of his earnings in Australia on paying back his debts.

According to the evidence led before the learned Magistrate, the Respondent-

Appellant had had Rs. 3,108,940/- in an account maintained by him at the Bank of

Ceylon as of 2nd December 2011, and all but Rs. 2706.63/- had been withdrawn after

the Applicant-Respondent took necessary legal steps to separate from him. The

Respondent-Appellant had taken the position that he withdrew the money in order to

pay back his loans, obtained to facilitate their migration to Australia.

One Wipulasenaa relative of the Respondent-Appellanthad testified that he lent

the Respondent-Appellant two million rupees by pawning his wifes jewellery and

leasing his vehicle. One Buwaneka had testified that he lent one million rupees, which

he collected from his friends, to the Respondent-Appellant. Neither of them have taken

any security or documentation in lending the said amounts, nor have they charged any

interests.7 As the learned High Court Judge has correctly concluded, such amounts

being let with no security or documentation and not interest, while the lenders would

be paying interest themselves, is highly improbable and cannot therefore be accepted.

As the learned judge has further noted, despite having returned to Sri Lanka in the

early days of November 2011, the Respondent-Appellant has waited over a month to

purportedly pay back his debts, while his friend and relative who lent him money were

paying interests. This, too, is highly improbable.

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 12

Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has concluded the Respondent-Appellant to

have sufficient means based on the finding that the Respondent-Appellant had the

capacity to earn, for he has failed to adduce any proof of illness or similar incapacity

despite having so claimed. He had already worked as a labourer from time to time, at

the time material, according to his own admission.

The learned Judge has relied on the case of Rasamany v. Subramaniam,8 where His

Lordship Basnayake J observed as follows:

In my view section 2 should be given a wide meaning and not restricted in its

scope to persons having an income or actually earning at the time of the

application. In this context the word " means " should be taken to include capacity

to earn money. It cannot be that the legislature when enacting these provisions

intended to exclude from the scope of sections 2 and 3 able-bodied men capable

of earning and maintaining their wives and children but who by their voluntary

act refrain from so doing.9

Citing Eales JC in Me Tha v. Nga San E.10 with approval, His Lordship further noted

that a mere denial by the man himself of sufficiency of means, when that man is an-

able bodied man, is not conclusive proof of want of sufficient means and that a man is

not, and ought not to be, permitted by his own voluntary act to free himself from the

elementary duty of maintaining his wife and children.11

The aforementioned observations were made with regard to section 2 of the

Maintenance Ordinance, well before the enactment of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of

1999. Despite that, the observations are most certainly consistent with the scheme of

SC Appeal 49/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 12

the Maintenance Act and therefore remain as relevant today as they were five decades

ago.

As it can be observed, the question of law in the instant case is purely hypothetical and

has no bearing on the case as the learned Magistrate nor the learned High Court Judge

had based their decisions on the Medico-Legal Report or any other unmarked

document submitted with the written submissions. As such, I see no need to answer

the question of law.

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned High Court

Judge and the same is affirmed. The decision of the learned High Court Judge is to be

accordingly implemented. The Applicant-Respondent is entitled to costs.
