"Sadhanantham","(AIR  1979  SC  1284), 
the  Supreme  Court  of 
India"
"declared:",""
"","Before  proceeding  to  discuss  the  evidence  and  the  findings  of  the"
"","High Court we remind ourselves of the confines of our jurisdiction to"
"","deal with appeals by special leave against judgments of acquittal by"
"","the High Court.  Article 136 of the Constitution of India invests the"
"","Supreme Court with a plentitude of plenary, appellate power over all"
"","Courts and Tribunals in India. The power is plenary in the sense that"
"","there are no words in Article 136 itself qualifying that power. But,"
"","the very nature of the power has led the Court for set limits to itself"
"","within which to exercise such power. It is now the well established"
"","practice  of  this  Court  to  permit  the  invocation  of  the  power  under"
"Article  136  only","in  very  exceptional  circumstances,  as  when  a"
"","question  of  law  of  general  public  importance  arises  or  a  decision"
"","shocks  the  conscience  of  the  Court.  But,  within  the  restrictions"
"","imposed by itself, this Court has the undoubted power to interfere"
"","even with findings of fact making no distinction between judgment"
"","of  acquittal  and  conviction,  if  the  High  Court,  in  arriving  at  those"
"","findings, has acted “perversely or otherwise improperly”."
