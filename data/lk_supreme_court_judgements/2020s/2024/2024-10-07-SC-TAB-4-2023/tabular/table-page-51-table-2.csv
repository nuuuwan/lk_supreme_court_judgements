"Wickremasinghe and Others v. Cornel Perera and Others [1996] 1 Sri LR"
"294, Mark Fernando J. observed at 299-300:"
"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court can be granted either by the"
"Court of Appeal under Article 128(1) or by this Court under Article"
"128(2). Counsel argued that when the Court of Appeal granted leave,"
"it did so in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. But that seems"
"misconceived.  Under  Article  138  the  appellate  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Court of Appeal is to correct errors by inferior Courts. When it grants"
"leave, it does not purport to correct errors either of inferior Courts or"
"of its own. Obtaining leave is a condition precedent to invoking the"
"appellate  jurisdiction  of  this  Court,  and  the  grant  of  leave  only"
"involves considering whether the matter is fit for review. It is thus"
"distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. In the"
"same  way,  when  the  Supreme  Court  grants  leave  under  Article"
"128(2),  it  exercises  a  jurisdiction  which  is  anterior  to  and  distinct"
"from  its  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  proceedings  in  respect  of  leave"
"are  thus  distinct  from  the  appeal  itself.  In  any  event,  even  if  in  a"
"broader  sense  they  can  loosely  be  regarded  as  being  part  of  the"
"appellate  jurisdiction,  yet  it  has  two  distinct  stages,  involving  two"
"distinct issues: the first is whether leave ought to be granted, and"
"that depends on whether the question is important enough to merit"
"adjudication by the highest Court, and the second is, at the appeal"
"stage, to find the right answer to that question. Thus it may happen"
"that even if this Court thinks that probably the question raised must"
"be  answered  adversely  to  the  petitioner,  yet  the  Court  may  grant"
"leave because it is in the public interest that that question should be"
"finally and authoritatively decided by this Court."
