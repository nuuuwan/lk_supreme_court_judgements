"matter or proceedings in which it is satisfied that the question to be"
"decided is of public or general importance."
"In terms of Article 128(1) and (2), an appeal does not lie directly to the"
"Supreme  Court  without  first  obtaining  leave  to  appeal.  There  is  no"
"absolute right to appeal to the Supreme Court. The leave of the Supreme"
"Court or of the Court of Appeal is a  sine qua non for a person to come"
"before the Supreme Court by way of appeal."
"However,  in  terms  of  Article  128(4),  “An  appeal  shall  lie  directly  to  the"
"Supreme Court on any matter and in the manner specifically provided for"
"by any other law passed by Parliament.”"
"There  are  several  avenues  to  invoke  the  appellate  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Supreme Court."
"Article  128(1)  is  one  avenue.  According  to  Article  128(1),  leave  can  be"
"obtained  from  the  Court  of  Appeal  against  any  final  order,  judgment,"
"decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal can grant"
"leave to appeal ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved party to"
"such matter or proceedings only if the question is a substantive question"
"of  law.  If  the  Court  of  Appeal  decides  to  grant  leave  to  appeal  ex  mero"
"motu, it was held in Mendis v. Abeysinghe [1989] 2 Sri LR 262 at 265-"
"266 that there is no necessity for the Court of Appeal to hear the parties"
"on that point."
"It is also noteworthy that leave to appeal may be sought not only by a"
"party to the action but also by any aggrieved party."
