"witnesses and testimonial trustworthiness of evidence contained in"
"testimonies of witnesses."
"In Collettes Limited v. Bank of Ceylon [1984] 2 Sri LR 253, Sharvananda"
"J. (as he then was) stated at 264-265 that while this Court undeniably"
"has  the  jurisdiction  to  revise  concurrent  findings  of  fact  made  by  the"
"lower courts in appropriate cases, it will generally refrain from interfering"
"with  the 
findings  of 
fact  unless  special  circumstances  exist.  Such"
"circumstances 
include 
instances  where  relevant  evidence  has  been"
"overlooked,  irrelevant  matters  have  been  considered,  the  conclusion  is"
"based  on  erroneous  reasoning  or  the  decision 
is  not  supported  by"
"sufficient evidence. Sharvananda J. stated that when the judgment of the"
"lower Court is replete with such shortcomings, “this court not only may"
"but is under a duty  to examine the supporting evidence and  reverse the"
"findings.”"
