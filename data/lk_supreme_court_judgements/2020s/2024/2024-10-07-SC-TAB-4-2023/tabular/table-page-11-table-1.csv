"Let  me  now  consider  the  provisions  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure"
"Act, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption"
"Act, and any other written laws governing appeals to the Court of Appeal"
"from  judgments,  sentences  or  orders  of  the  High  Court  in  cases  tried"
"without  a  Jury.  This  will  help  to  understand  the  appellate  procedure"
"against  judgments,  sentences  or  orders  pronounced  by  the  Permanent"
