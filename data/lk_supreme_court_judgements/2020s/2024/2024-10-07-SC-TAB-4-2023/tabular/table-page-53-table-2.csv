"highlighted by Kirby and Callinan JJ. in the same case, at para 49, as"
"follows:"
"However, 
the  rule  permitting  adverse 
interlocutory  orders 
to  be"
"contested 
in  an  appeal  against  a  final 
judgment  should  not  be"
"narrowly  confined.  This  approach  is  sanctioned  by  one  and  a  half"
"centuries of judicial practice spanning virtually the entire period since"
"appeal,  as  a creature of  statute,  became 
common 
to  our 
legal"
"system.  
The 
principle 
is 
also 
supported 
by  many 
practical"
"considerations.  Interlocutory appeals can often cause great injustice"
"to  parties  who  are 
less  well-resourced 
than 
those  who  pursue"
"them.  They can be misused by those with “a long purse” to prevent"
"others  from  securing 
justice 
in  an  early  trial  of  the  substantive"
"issues. They 
can 
lead 
to  a  plethora 
of  appeals  and 
further"
"interlocutory hearings that needlessly raise the costs and delay the"
"conclusion of litigation."
