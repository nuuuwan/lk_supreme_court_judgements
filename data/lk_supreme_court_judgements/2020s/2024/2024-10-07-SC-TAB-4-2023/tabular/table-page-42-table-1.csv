"is and this power is largely derived in the common run of cases from Article"
"136”, further added:"
"Is it merely a power in the Court to be exercised in any manner it"
"fancies? Is there no procedural limitation in the manner of exercise"
"and  the  occasion  for  exercise?  Is  there  no  duty  to  Act  fairly  while"
"hearing a case under Art. 136, either in the matter of grant of leave"
"or,  after  such  grant,  in  the  final  disposal  of  the  appeal?  We  have"
"hardly any doubt that there is procedure necessarily implicit in the"
"power vested in the Supreme Court. It must be remembered that Art."
"136 confers jurisdiction on the highest Court. The founding fathers"
"unarguably  intended  in  the  very  terms  of  Art.  136  that  it  shall  be"
"exercised  by 
the  highest 
judges  of 
the 
land  with  scrupulous"
"adherence  to  judicial  principles  well-established  by  precedents  in"
"our  jurisprudence.  Judicial  discretion  is  canalised  authority,  not"
"arbitrary eccentricity. Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial"
"Process,  Yale  University  Press  (1921),  with  elegant  accuracy,  has"
"observed:"
"“The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to"
"innovate  at  pleasure.  He  is  not  a  knight-errant  roaming  at  will  in"
"pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his"
"inspiration 
from  consecrated  principles.  He 
is  not 
to  yield 
to"
"spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated benevolence. He is"
"to  exercise  a  discretion 
informed  by 
tradition,  methodized  by"
"analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to the primordial"
"necessity of order in the social life. Wide enough in all conscience is"
"the field of discretion that remains.”"
