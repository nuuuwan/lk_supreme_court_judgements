"[SC Appeal 28/2016] - Page 10 of 10"
"The  Plaintiff  had  produced  the  afore-said  complaint  made  by  her  to  Parakandeniya  Grama"
"Niladhari on 08-04-2006 marked පැ.6."
"T
hus,  according  to  the Plaintiff’s  evidence,  it  was  in  2006  that  the  Plaintiff  had  demanded"
"vacant possession of the premises from the Defendant. In such scenario, the question arises"
"as to what the Plaintiff had attempted to achieve by producing the letter dated 15-11-1990"
"produced marked වි1. This is because it was in 1990 that the Plaintiff had demanded vacant"
"possession of the premises from the Defendant according to the letter marked වි1. Therefore,"
"it is clear that both the position in වි1 and the position taken up by the Plaintiff in oral evidence"
"cannot stand together. In those circumstances, I too have to approve the conclusion reached"
"by the Provincial High Court  of Civil Appeals that  the Plaintiff has failed to establish to the"
"satisfaction of Court that she gave leave and license for the Defendant to occupy the relevant"
"shop and the Defendant thereafter refused to vacate the premises when she demanded him"
"to do so."
"In the above circumstances, it is clear that the evidence adduced in the trial has successfully"
"established  the  prescriptive  title  of  the  Defendant.  Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"answering of Issue No. 08 in the affirmative by the learned District Judge is justified. Thus,"
"for the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law in respect of which this Court had"
"granted Leave to Appeal in the negative. I proceed to affirm the judgement dated 9th February"
"2015  pronounced  by  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeals  dismissing  the  Revision"
"Application filed by the Plaintiff."
"I
 proceed to dismiss this appeal."
