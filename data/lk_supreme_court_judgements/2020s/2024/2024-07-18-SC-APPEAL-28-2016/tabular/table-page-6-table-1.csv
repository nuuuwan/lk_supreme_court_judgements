"according to the document marked D1, the Defendant had come in to the occupation of the"
"premises before 1990."
"A
ccording to the Deed No. 886 (marked P1) the Plaintiff’s father had transferred the impugned"
"property to her on 20th December 1989. Thereafter, since the property has been transferred"
"in  the  name  of  the  Plaintiff,  one  must  understand  that  it  is  inevitable  that  all  the  other"
"subsequent  documentation  such  as  the  Notice  of  Assessment  (P3),  the  receipt  for  the"
"payment of Assessment Tax (P4),  permission granted to cut down two Jak trees (P5) have"
"to be issued in the name of the new owner irrespective of the person behind the respective"
"operations. This is particularly so in the instant case because all three persons involved in the"
"sequence of events relevant to this case are members of the same family i.e., father daughter"
"and  son.  Thus,  I  have  to  be  reticent  in  accepting  that  the  documents  relied  upon  by  the"
"Plaintiff: the Notice of Assessment (P3); the receipt for the payment of Assessment Tax (P4);"
"permission granted to cut down two Jak trees (P5); have firmly established that it was the"
"Plaintiff who was in possession of the impugned property for all purposes. Thus, let me further"
"probe into this aspect by considering the oral evidence adduced by both parties in the trial."
"It was on 07-07-2006 that the Plaintiff had filed plaint in this case against the Defendant. The"
"Plaintiff’s  father  had  transferred  the  property  to  the  Plaintiff  on  20th  December  1989.  The"
"following excerpts from the Plaintiff’s evidence would show that even on the Plaintiff’s account,"
"the Defendant had been in possession of this property by at least 1990. These excerpts are"
"as follows:"
"ප්‍ර:  තමා අරන් තියෙන්යන් 1989. අවුරුදු 2ක් ගිෙත් තමාට එන්න දුන්යන් නැහැ යන්ද?"
"උ:  ඔව්. 1"
"T
hus, I can observe that even the Plaintiff in her evidence has accepted the position taken up"
"by the Defendant that the Defendant came to occupy this shop premises somewhere in 1987"
"or 1988. Since the Defendant has also stated that the Plaintiff started disturbing his possession"
"since 1990, I observe that the above evidence of the Plaintiff has confirmed the Defendant’s"
"position. Therefore, I have no doubt that the Defendant had commenced the possession of"
"this property somewhere in 1990 as asserted by him. Therefore, there is no difficulty to hold"
"that the Defendant had been in possession of this property for more than ten years prior to"
"bringing the instant action by the Plaintiff in 2006."
