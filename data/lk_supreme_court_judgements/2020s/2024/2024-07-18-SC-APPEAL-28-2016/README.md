COUNSEL : Manohara De Silva, PC with Hirosha Munasinghe and Sasiri

Chandrasiri for the Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant

Charith Galhena instructed by Shalani Jayasinghe for

Defendant-Respondent-Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 23-10-2023

DECIDED ON : 18-07-2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Plaintiff-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) filed plaint in

this case against the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Defendant) praying inter alia for following relief:

(i) a declaration that he is the owner of the property more fully described in the

schedule to the Plaint;

(ii) an order for ejectment of the Defendant from the said premises;

(iii) an order for damages payable for the alleged illegal occupation of the said premises

by the Defendant.

The Plaintiff is sister of the Defendant. Both parties have admitted the fact that the property

relevant to this case was owned by David Madduma Liyanage, who is the father of both the

Plaintiff and the Defendant.

The Plaintiff states that her father, said David Madduma Liyanage, by Deed No. 886 attested

by D. H. Ekanayake Notary Public on 20th December 1989, had transferred the said property

to her. The Plaintiff also states that she continued to possess the said property since that

time.

It is the position of the Plaintiff that she gave leave and license for her brother (the

Defendant), to occupy the small shop premises in 1997. The Plaintiff has alleged that the

Defendant had constructed some additions to that premises in violation of the permission she

had granted to him for mere occupation. It is the case for the Plaintiff that she had terminated

the aforesaid leave and license and informed the Defendant to handover the vacant possession

of the said shop back to her. The Plaintiff has filed this action as the Defendant had failed to

heed the said demand for the vacant possession.

[SC Appeal 28/2016] - Page 4 of 10

The position taken up by the Defendant is that he had acquired the prescriptive title to this

property. This can be seen from Issue No. 8 framed by the Defendant which is as follows:

ISSUE NO. 08

In relation to the land, as defined in both the Schedule to the Plaint and the

Schedule of the Defendants Answer to the Plaint, does the Defendant enjoy

continuous and uninterrupted possession of the land as an independent land, in

a manner adverse to the rights of any other, since some time, in or around the

month of December of 1989?

While the Plaintiff, Plaintiffs sister (Madduma Liyanage Yasuntha) had given evidence on

behalf of the Plaintiff, the Defendant and a resident (Ranjith Upali Radampala Gamage), living

in the vicinity of the land in dispute, had given evidence on behalf of the Defendant.

After the trial, the learned District Judge by her judgement dated 26th March 2012, had

concluded that the Defendant had acquired the prescriptive title to the relevant premises.

Being aggrieved by the judgment pronounced by the District Court, the Plaintiff had filed a

Revision Application in the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. After the argument, the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals by its judgement dated 9th February 2015, had proceeded

to dismiss the said Revision Application with costs.

In addition to the merits of the case, the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals also had based

its decision to dismiss the Plaintiffs Revision Application, on her failure to adduce exceptional

circumstances in view of her failure to lodge an appeal against the impugned judgment

pronounced by the District Court.

Being aggrieved by the judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals,

the Plaintiff has filed the instant appeal. When the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant to the

instant appeal was supported, this Court by its Order dated 30th November 2015, having heard

the learned Counsel for both parties, had decided to grant Leave to Appeal on the following

question:

Did the High Court as well as the District Court misdirect themselves by failing to

properly consider the ingredients of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance and the

legal principles pertaining to proof of prescriptive title, in considering whether the

Defendant has prescribed the land in suit.

[SC Appeal 28/2016] - Page 5 of 10

Since, the above question of law has referred to Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, let

me at the outset, reproduce the said section below:

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any

action or by those under whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by

a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action

(that is to say, a possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or

performance of service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor from which

an acknowledgement of a right existing in another person would fairly and

naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of such action, shall

entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with costs. And in like manner,

when any plaintiff shall bring his action, or any third party shall intervene in any

action for the purpose of being quieted in his possession of lands or other

immovable property, or to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to

establish his claim in any other manner to such land or other property, proof of

such undisturbed and uninterrupted possession as hereinbefore explained, by

such plaintiff or intervenient, or by those under whom he claims, shall entitle

such plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in his favour with costs:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run against parties

claiming estates in remainder or reversion from the time when the parties so

claiming acquired a right of possession to the property in dispute.

It is the position taken up by the Defendant in his evidence, that he came to occupy this shop

premises somewhere in 1987 or 1988. He also has stated that the Plaintiff started disturbing

his possession since 1990.

The Plaintiff in her evidence has produced the Notice of Assessment marked P3 and the

receipt issued on 26-03-2008 for the payment of Assessment Tax to Gampaha Pradeshiya

Sabha marked P4 to show that she had paid Assessment Tax in the year 2008. She also has

relied on the document dated 03-11-2005 marked P5 which is a permission granted by the

Divisional Secretary to fell two Jak trees in that premises. The Plaintiff has also relied on the

complaint she had made on 08-04-2006 to the Grama Niladhari of the area.

The perusal of the judgment of the learned District Judge, shows that the learned District

Judge had concluded that it was the Plaintiffs father who had permitted the Defendant to

occupy the relevant premises. The learned Provincial High Court Judge had concluded that

[SC Appeal 28/2016] - Page 6 of 10

6

according to the document marked D1, the Defendant had come in to the occupation of the

premises before 1990.

According to the Deed No. 886 (marked P1) the Plaintiffs father had transferred the impugned

property to her on 20th December 1989. Thereafter, since the property has been transferred

in the name of the Plaintiff, one must understand that it is inevitable that all the other

subsequent documentation such as the Notice of Assessment (P3), the receipt for the

payment of Assessment Tax (P4), permission granted to cut down two Jak trees (P5) have

to be issued in the name of the new owner irrespective of the person behind the respective

operations. This is particularly so in the instant case because all three persons involved in the

sequence of events relevant to this case are members of the same family i.e., father daughter

and son. Thus, I have to be reticent in accepting that the documents relied upon by the

Plaintiff: the Notice of Assessment (P3); the receipt for the payment of Assessment Tax (P4);

permission granted to cut down two Jak trees (P5); have firmly established that it was the

Plaintiff who was in possession of the impugned property for all purposes. Thus, let me further

probe into this aspect by considering the oral evidence adduced by both parties in the trial.

It was on 07-07-2006 that the Plaintiff had filed plaint in this case against the Defendant. The

Plaintiffs father had transferred the property to the Plaintiff on 20th December 1989. The

following excerpts from the Plaintiffs evidence would show that even on the Plaintiffs account,

the Defendant had been in possession of this property by at least 1990. These excerpts are

as follows:

: 1989. 2 ?

: . 1

Thus, I can observe that even the Plaintiff in her evidence has accepted the position taken up

by the Defendant that the Defendant came to occupy this shop premises somewhere in 1987

or 1988. Since the Defendant has also stated that the Plaintiff started disturbing his possession

since 1990, I observe that the above evidence of the Plaintiff has confirmed the Defendants

position. Therefore, I have no doubt that the Defendant had commenced the possession of

this property somewhere in 1990 as asserted by him. Therefore, there is no difficulty to hold

that the Defendant had been in possession of this property for more than ten years prior to

bringing the instant action by the Plaintiff in 2006.

On her own account, the Plaintiff in her evidence has stated that the Defendant at no time

allowed her to enter the relevant property. The relevant excerpts from the Plaintiffs evidence

are reproduced below:

: . . .

: 1991 ?

The Plaintiffs evidence in this regard has been confirmed and corroborated by the evidence

of the Plaintiffs sister (Madduma Liyanage Yasuntha), by the evidence of the Defendant and

also by the evidence of (Ranjith Upali Radampala Gamage) a resident living in the vicinity of

the land who was called to give evidence on behalf of the Defendant.

The afore-stated evidence of the Plaintiffs sister (Madduma Liyanage Yasuntha), in this regard

is as follows:

: 1990 ?

: .

In the presence of the above evidence, it is not difficult to hold that the possession of this

property by Defendant is undisturbed and uninterrupted possession within the meaning of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The evidence of (Ranjith Upali Radampala Gamage) a resident living in the vicinity of the land

who was called to give evidence on behalf of the Defendant has also established the fact that

the Defendant has at no time allowed the Plaintiff to come into occupation of this premises is

clearly established. That is manifested by the following pieces of evidence adduced in the

case.

Thus, the fact that the Defendant in the instant case has continuously maintained and claimed

a title adverse to that of the plaintiff is also established before Court.

It is not the case of the Plaintiff that the possession held by the Defendant was at any time

accompanied by any payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty within the

meaning of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. However, it is the position of the Plaintiff

that she gave leave and license for the Defendant, to occupy the relevant shop premises in

1997 and the Defendant refused to vacate the premises when she demanded him to do so by

virtue of the letter dated 15-11-1990 produced marked 1.

I observe that the Plaintiff in her evidence has failed to state as to when, or during what

period (at least approximately), she had granted leave and license for the Defendant, to

occupy the relevant shop premises. On the other hand, she has also stated in her evidence

that it was in 2006 that she demanded vacant possession of the premises from the Defendant.

The following excerpts from her evidence clearly show this position.

The Plaintiff had produced the afore-said complaint made by her to Parakandeniya Grama

Niladhari on 08-04-2006 marked .6.

Thus, according to the Plaintiffs evidence, it was in 2006 that the Plaintiff had demanded

vacant possession of the premises from the Defendant. In such scenario, the question arises

as to what the Plaintiff had attempted to achieve by producing the letter dated 15-11-1990

produced marked 1. This is because it was in 1990 that the Plaintiff had demanded vacant

possession of the premises from the Defendant according to the letter marked 1. Therefore,

it is clear that both the position in 1 and the position taken up by the Plaintiff in oral evidence

cannot stand together. In those circumstances, I too have to approve the conclusion reached

by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals that the Plaintiff has failed to establish to the

satisfaction of Court that she gave leave and license for the Defendant to occupy the relevant

shop and the Defendant thereafter refused to vacate the premises when she demanded him

to do so.

In the above circumstances, it is clear that the evidence adduced in the trial has successfully

established the prescriptive title of the Defendant. Therefore, I am of the view that the

answering of Issue No. 08 in the affirmative by the learned District Judge is justified. Thus,

for the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law in respect of which this Court had

granted Leave to Appeal in the negative. I proceed to affirm the judgement dated 9th February

2015 pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals dismissing the Revision

Application filed by the Plaintiff.

I proceed to dismiss this appeal.
