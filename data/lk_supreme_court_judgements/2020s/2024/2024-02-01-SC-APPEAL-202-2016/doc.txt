Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kegalle to partition

the land now depicted in the preliminary plan among the plaintiff (7/10

share) and the 1st defendant (3/10 share). According to the plaintiffs

pedigree, the 2nd and 3rd defendants have no rights in the corpus. The 2nd

defendant is a sister of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The 3rd

defendant is the husband of the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant claimed

1/3 share by inheritance, and the 3rd defendant claimed 2/15 share by

deed No. 5395 dated 31.10.1998 marked 2D3.

After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs action on the basis

that the plaintiff has not unfolded a full pedigree. On appeal, the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Kegalle set aside the judgment of the District

Court and directed the District Judge to enter the Interlocutory Decree

in terms of the pedigree of the plaintiff.

The parties are governed by the Kandyan law. The High Court concluded

that the 2nd defendant does not get rights from her father since she

contracted a diga marriage. The High Court further concluded that the

3rd defendant does not get rights from deed No. 5395 because the

4

SC/APPEAL/202/2016

transferor of that deed, namely Premaratne, did not have remaining

rights to alienate at that time.

Being dissatisfied with that judgment, the 2nd and 3rd defendants

preferred this appeal with leave obtained from this Court on the following

three questions of law:

(a) Did Premaratne not transfer 1/5 share inherited from his father

Jamis to the 1st defendant by deed No. 3167 dated 13.06.1997

(1D1)?

(b) Did Premaratne transfer 1/5 share inherited from his father Jamis

to the 3rd defendant by deed No. 5395 dated 31.10.1998 (2D3)?

(c) Is the 3rd defendant entitled to 1/5 of the corpus by deed marked

2D3?

The original owner of the land was Jamis. According to the plaintiffs

pedigree, upon the death of Jamis on 05.11.1970, his rights devolved 1/2

on the plaintiff and 1/2 on Premaratne. There is currently no dispute

over this, and the 2nd defendant does not assert 1/3 share by inheritance.

Premaratne executed the following deeds after the death of his father,

Jamis. Consequently, whatever he transferred has to be from his share

of the corpus, not from the entire corpus. He cannot transfer what he

does not have.

By deed No. 5928 dated 16.06.1994 marked P5, Premaratne transferred

1/5 of his 1/2 share to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff became

entitled to 1/2 + 1/10 = 6/10 share of the corpus.

By deed No. 3167 dated 13.06.1997 marked 1D1, Premaratne transferred

1/5 of his 1/2 share to the 1st defendant. Thereafter, by deed No. 3869

dated 06.06.1998 marked 1D2, Premaratne transferred another 1/5 of

5

SC/APPEAL/202/2016

his 1/2 share to the 1st defendant. Accordingly, the 1st defendant became

entitled to 2/10 share.

By deed No. 5395 dated 31.10.1998 marked 2D3, Premaratne transferred

all his remaining shares to the 3rd defendant. Accordingly, the 3rd

defendant became entitled to 2/10 share of the corpus.

The share allocation calculated by the High Court is not correct. The

mistake made by the learned High Court Judge was that, although he

first stated that Premaratne had to transfer rights from his 1/2 share, he

later calculated shares on the basis that Premaratne transferred those

rights from the entire corpus.

The judgments of the District Court and the High Court are set aside and

the appeal of the 3rd defendant is allowed.

The District Judge will amend the Interlocutory Decree accordingly and

take follow up steps in accordance with the partition law.
