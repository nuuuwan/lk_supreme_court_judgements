"his 1/2 share to the 1st defendant. Accordingly, the 1st defendant became"
"entitled to 2/10 share."
"By deed No. 5395 dated 31.10.1998 marked 2D3, Premaratne transferred"
"all  his  remaining  shares  to  the  3rd  defendant.  Accordingly,  the  3rd"
"defendant became entitled to 2/10 share of the corpus."
"The  share  allocation  calculated  by  the  High  Court  is  not  correct.  The"
"mistake  made  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  that,  although  he"
"first stated that Premaratne had to transfer rights from his 1/2 share, he"
"later  calculated  shares  on  the  basis  that  Premaratne  transferred  those"
"rights from the entire corpus."
"The judgments of the District Court and the High Court are set aside and"
"the appeal of the 3rd defendant is allowed."
"The District Judge will amend the Interlocutory Decree accordingly and"
"take follow up steps in accordance with the partition law."
