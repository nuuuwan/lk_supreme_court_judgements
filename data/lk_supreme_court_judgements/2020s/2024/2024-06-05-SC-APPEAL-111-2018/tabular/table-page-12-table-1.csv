"beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution. However,"
"the Learned High Court
judge of Gampaha affirmed the"
"conviction in respect of
the remaining two charges based"
"on sections 386 and 389 of the penal code."
"Aggrieved by the decision of
the High Court of Gampaha,"
"the
Accused
Appellant
Appellant
by
petition
dated"
"20.09.2017 sought special
leave to appeal
from this court."
"Accordingly this court granted special
leave to appeal from"
"the
aforementioned
judgment
of
the
High
Court
of"
"Gampaha."
"In the written submissions of
the Respondent Respondent"
"it was submitted that
the money was misappropriated by"
"the
fact
that
it was
not
returned
to
the Complainant"
"despite multiple attempts made by her and her husband to"
"have
the
money
returned
to
them.
It
was
further"
"submitted
that
this
amounts
to
the Accused Appellant"
"Appellant acting dishonestly and thus the actus reus and"
"mens rea of both offenses have been established based on"
"the evidence."
"I will proceed to
address
the
question of
law on which"
"special
leave has been granted, namely that “The Learned"
"High Court Judge has erred by failing to consider the"
"basic
elements
to prove
charges
of
section 386 and"
"389 of the Penal Code.”"
"In order to answer the question of
law I will
first focus on"
"the definition of
the offense of Criminal Misappropriation"
"which
is
set
out
in section 386
of
the
Penal Code
as"
"follows:"
"“Whoever
dishonestly misappropriates
or
converts
to
his"
"own
use
any movable
property
shall
be
punished with"
