"The position of the Accused Appellant Appellant is that on"
"the date concerned 10.09.2012, he was not present at the"
"Sampath Bank branch in Gampaha as he was at work at"
"the Panagoda Army Camp and has produced a witness to"

to evade returning the money.
I"
"believe that
this transaction has been entered into by the"
"parties purely based on trust which PW1 and PW2 had"
