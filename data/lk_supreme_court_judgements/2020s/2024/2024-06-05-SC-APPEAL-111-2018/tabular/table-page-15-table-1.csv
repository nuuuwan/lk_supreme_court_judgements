"initial
taking.
If
the initial
taking of
the property not
in the"
"possession of anyone is dishonest
then too the offence is"
"made out.
In regard to this,
I agree with the view expressed"
"by Justice Moseley in Salgado V. Mudali Pulle (supra).‚Äù"
"Therefore, considering the evidence led at trial, the money"
"was borrowed by the Accused Appellant Appellant in order"
"to facilitate money
for a relative who was
going abroad."
"The
undertaking
of
P1
was
signed
by
the
Accused"
"Appellant Appellant at
the point of borrowing, agreeing to"
"repay
the money
in
laches.
I
note
that
no
evidence"
"regarding the relative traveling abroad in respect of whom"
"the money
was
borrowed
has
been
led
at
trial.
The"
"Accused Appellant Appellant stated during his testimony"
"that
he
did
not
sign
P.01
at
the
point
of
borrowing,"
"however he signed an empty paper at a later stage owing to"
"the constant pressure by PW1 and PW2 for the repayment"
"of
the
borrowed money. The
Learned Magistrate
in her"
"judgment
stated
that
if
the
position
of
the
Accused"
"Appellant Appellant
is that he signed an empty paper at a"
"later date, due
to
the pressure by PW1 and PW2 such"
"should have been mentioned to the police at
the point of"
"his arrest."
"According to the testimony of PW4 the officer who recorded"
"the
statement
of
the
Accused
Appellant
Appellant,
no"
"mention of
such was made
and the Accused Appellant"
"Appellant
had
admitted
that
he
did
in
fact
sign
the"
"document marked P1 in his statement
to PW4. Therefore"
"the
Learned
Magistrate
correctly
concluded
that
the"
"Accused Appellant Appellant had clear knowledge of
the"
"contents
of
P1
at
the
point
of
signing
and
I
am in"
"agreement with this stance of the Learned Magistrate."
