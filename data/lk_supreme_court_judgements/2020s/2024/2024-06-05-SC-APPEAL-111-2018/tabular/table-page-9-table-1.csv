"every month army officers are required to send a letter to"
"their divisional head regarding
the number of days they"
"had
reported
to work.
The witness
stated
that he had"
"brought
along with him the
true

of
such a

Appellant
had"

concluded
their

witness"
"during

examination
stated
that
the
Accused"
"Appellant Appellant had not
taken part
in the morning"
"parade
on
the
day
in

However,
during"
"re-examination
the
witness
testified
that
although
the"
"Accused Appellant Appellant had not
taken part
in the"
"morning parade,
if he reported to work thereafter it would"
"be reflected on the Register as he had reported to work on"
"that day."
"Having considered the evidence at
length led by both the"
"prosecution and defense witnesses the learned Magistrate"
"decided against the Accused Appellant Appellant."
"The Learned Magistrate in her
judgment stated that
it
is"
"obvious
that
there
had
been
no
previous
relationship"
"between
the
Accused

and

the
Accused"
"Appellant Appellant has admitted to signing the document"

the Accused Appellant Appellant had signed an"
"empty paper as he had claimed in his
original
testimony"
"then there was no hindrance for him to inform the police"
"of doing so at the point at which he was arrested. However,"
"based
on
the
testimony
of
PW4
(Police
Sergeant)
the"
"Accused Appellant Appellant had not done so at any point."
"The
Learned Magistrate
stated that
it
