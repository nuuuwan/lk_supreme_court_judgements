"The Supreme Court held in the case of Barber v Abdulla"
"[1920] 7C.W. R 144 that; “in order to maintain a charge of"
"criminal misappropriation,
the prosecution need show only"
"that
the property belonged to some person other
than the"
"accused.

“the
offense
of
criminal"
"misappropriation consists in the dishonest conversion to the"
"uses of the party charged of the property of another. I do not"
"think
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
actual
owner"
"should be disclosed in all cases.
It may be sufficient if there"
"is
some
person
entitled
to
the
possession
of
the
goods"
"misappropriated”."
"In the written submission of the Respondent Respondent it"
"is contended as per G.L Peiris, The Offences under the"
"Penal Code of Sri Lanka 2nd Edition on page 453 “The"
"central
idea involved in the concepts of
‘misappropriation’"
"and ‘conversion’
is the setting apart property for the wrong"
"person
or
for
the wrong purpose. The actus
reus
of
the"
"offense
requires
that
the
property
should
be
used
or"
"exploited for
the benefit of some person who is not
legally"
"entitled to the property.”"
"In
this
case,
the
Prosecution
has
proved
beyond
a"
"reasonable doubt that the 2 million rupees belonged to the"
"PW2
and the Accused Appellant Appellant by
failing
to"
"return the amount borrowed has deprived the PW1 and"
"PW2 of the benefit that could be derived from that amount"
"of money."
