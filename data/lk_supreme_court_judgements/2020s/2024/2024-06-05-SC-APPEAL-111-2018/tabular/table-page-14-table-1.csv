"The mens
rea
of
the
offence
requires
the
element
of"
"dishonest
intention. Section 22 of
the Penal Code defines"
"dishonestly as follows:"
"“Whoever does anything with the intention of causing"
"wrongful
gain
to
one
person,
or wrongful
loss
to"
"another person, is said to do that thing “dishonestly”."
"Section 21 of
the Penal Code defines wrongful gain and"
"wrongful
loss as follows:"
"“Wrongful gain is gain by unlawful means of property"
"to which the person gaining is not legally entitled."
"Wrongful
loss
is
the
loss
by
unlawful means
of"
"property
to which
the
person
losing
it
is
legally"
"entitled.”"
"It
was
the
previous
judicial
position
that
an
initial"
"innocent taking of the property followed by a guilty state of"
"mind
at
a
later
stage
was
required.
This
view
was"
"overturned in the case of Attorney General Vs. Menthis"
"[1960] 61 NLR 561 where Justice Sinnetamby Observed"
"that
“The main provisions of Section 386 make dishonest"
"misappropriation
at any stage an offence; Explanation 2"
"only provides for a special case where the initial
taking is"
"honest and its intended to protect
the finder of property not"
"in the possession of anyone so long, and only so long, as"
"his continued possession of
that property is honest.
If, of"
"course,
the property taken was in the possession of some"
"person the resulting offence would be theft.
In my opinion,"
"therefore in order
to constitute misappropriation under our"
"law it
is not necessary that
there should be an innocent"
