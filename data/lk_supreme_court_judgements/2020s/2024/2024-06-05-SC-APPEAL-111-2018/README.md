The application for special leave to appeal was preferred bythe Accused Appellant Appellant (hereinafter referred to asthe Appellant) against the judgment of the High Courtdated 31.08.2017 affirming the judgment of the LearnedMagistrate subject to the variations. Aggrieved by whichthe Accused Appellant Appellant appealed to the SupremeCourt.

Accordingly, this court by order dated 25.07.2018 grantedspecial leave to appeal on the following question of law:

1. Did the Learned High Court Judge err by failing to

consider the basic elements to prove the charges ofsection 386 and 389 of the Penal Code.

TheAccusedNishankaArachchige Mahesh ChamindaPriyantha Kumara was charged in the Magistrate Court ofGampaha under sections 403, 386 and 389 of the PenalCode. The Accused once the charges were read over andexplained to him, pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Thetrial commenced on 24.07.2014. The prosecution called 03witnesses and closed its case marking a document P.01 asevidence. When defense was called, 03 witnesses gaveevidence on behalf of the Accused and marked a documentV.01. At the conclusion of the trial the Learned Magistrateconvicted the Accused for all three charges. The Accusedwas sentenced to 6 months simple imprisonment andordered Rs.100,000/- as compensation.

The facts of the case briefly are as follows:

TheAccusedAppellantAppellantnamelyNishankaArachchigeMaheshChaminda Priyantha Kumara hadbeen serving in the Sri Lanka Army with the Husband oftheComplainantJayasuriyaKuranagePriyankaJayasuriya (PW1) both of them were members of the SriLanka Army Volleyball Team. They had been acquaintedwith the Husband of the Complainant for approximately 8years. As per the Testimony of PW1, the Accused AppellantAppellant had needed to show proof of funds in order tosend a relative of the Appellant abroad for which heneeded to show he had Rs 2,000,000.00/- in his bankaccount and sought the assistance of the ComplainantsHusband in order to furnish the same. On 10.09.2012 the

4

Complainant (PW1) had handed over the said amount ofRs 2,000,000.00/- to the Accused Appellant Appellant atthe Sampath Bank branch at Gampaha and the AccusedAppellant Appellant had signed a document (P1) whichstipulated that he had promised and agreed to repay theComplainantby10.10.2012intranches.TheComplainant had obtained this money from her husbandwho had received the same as a pension and otherretirement benefits upon his retirement from the Sri LankaArmy. Thereafter, the Accused Appellant Appellant failedto return the money as agreed and on 13.12.2012 acomplaint was lodged to the Police by PW1 informing thatthe Accused Appellant Appellant had failed to return themoney as agreed on 10.10.2012, also to the fact that theAccusedAppellantAppellanthadbeenavoidingtheComplainant.TheHusbandoftheComplainanthadinformed his Superior Officers at the Sri Lanka Armyregarding the incident and obtained a letter from thesalary documentation division of the Sri Lanka Army andproduced at the time the police complaint was made. PW1states that after such a complaint was made to thesuperior officers the Accused Appellant Appellant wasgiven a period of 14 days to return the money and theAccusedAppellantAppellantsignedanotherletterpromising to do so. However, as the money had not beenreturned during the14 day period agreed upon, theAccused Appellant Appellant was suspended from work.

AsPertheevidenceofPW2the(HusbandoftheComplainant), had agreed to provide the money to theAccused Appellant Appellant on the condition that it wouldbe repaid within one or two months in two tranches and

5

signed the document (P1) promising to do so. He statedthat the money had been handed over to the AccusedAppellant Appellant by PW1 at the Sampath Bank branchof Gampaha and that he too had been present. Thewitness stated that the money could not be given by himas he had plans to go abroad and due to such reason hiswife(PW1)handedoverthemoneytotheAccusedAppellant Appellant. The witness stated that after a yearhad passed and the Accused Appellant Appellant had notreturned the money, PW2 proceeded to make a complaintto his Superior Officers in the Sri Lanka Army. Thereafter,since the Accused Appellant Appellant had not returnedthe money within 14 days as promised he proceeded tomake a police complaint.

As per the evidence of PW4 who served as a police sergeantat the Special Crimes Investigations Division Gampahawho recorded the complaint made by PW1 that an amountof 2 million was given to the Accused Appellant Appellanton the agreement that it would be paid back in onemonths time and the amount had not been returned up todate. The witness stated that thereafter he proceeded torecord the statement of PW2 and then submitted therelevant B report to the Gampaha Magistrates Court. Thewitness further stated that once it was ascertained by himthat the Accused Appellant Appellant was serving as anArmy Officer at the Panagoda Army Camp he informed theAccused Appellant Appellant who then came to the SpecialInvestigations Division. Following which, he was arrestedafter being informed of the complaints against him. Thewitness stated that he then recorded the statement of theAccused Appellant Appellant. Following the testimony of

6

PW4 and marking P1 the prosecution concluded their caseand called for the Defense.

The Defense thereafter led three witnesses, the AccusedAppellant Appellant testified that he was serving in thecapacity of an Army Officer in the Panagoda Army camp.He stated that on the day concerned (10.09.2012) hereported to work at the camp however, due to injuries hehad sufferedfrom a motor vehicle accident he was notdressed in uniform and due to such reasons he wasexcused from taking part in the parade. The AccusedAppellant Appellant further stated that he had never metPW1 and never entered into any monetary transactionswith PW1. He further stated that he was not present at theSampath Bank branch in Gampaha on the date in concernas he was at the Panagoda Army Camp at the time. Hestatedthathiswifeoperatesashoebusinessandborrowed some money for the aforesaid business fromPW1. He stated that he only provided a letter in writingdue to the constant trouble he had to undergo on part ofPW1 and her husband PW2. he stated that he provided theletterinsteadofhiswifebecausehiswifewasnotemployed. The Accused Appellant Appellant further statedthat owing to this incident he lost his job at the Sri LankaArmy and the Higher officers within the Army too askedhim to provide another letter regarding the aforementionedincident.

Defense witness 2 who is the wife of the Accused AppellantAppellant stated in her testimony that she met with PW1on 2012.09.10 in order to borrow money which wasnecessary for her shoe business which was on the verge ofbankruptcy. The witness stated that in order to salvage

7

her business she borrowed this amount of money fromPW1.Shefurtherstatedthatherhusband(AccusedAppellant Appellant) had not been present at the time thetransaction had taken place and that no letter had beenprovided to PW1 stipulating how the money will be paidback to PW1 on that day. The witness stated thereafterthat PW1 constantly troubled them demanding repaymentof the money borrowed. The witness stated that well afterthe date the transaction had taken place she visited theresidence off PW1 with her brother and she handed over asigned undertaking to PW1 to return the money. Thewitnessstatedthatthisisthedocumentwhichtheprosecution has marked as P.01 which the prosecutionstates has been signed on the day the money was handedover to the Accused Appellant Appellant by PW1 at theGampahabranchofSampathBankatthe time thetransaction took place. The witness stated that due to theconstant demands of PW1 they decided to resort to evenselling property in order to settle the money borrowed forwhich PW1 demanded that 20% interest be added to theborrowed amount. The witness stated that they had nomeans to repay such an amount. The witness stated thatthereafter a complaint was made against her husband (TheAccused Appellant Appellant) at the Panagoda Army campfollowing which he was let go from his duties, owing to thisthey were not able to repay the loan amount.

Defense witness 3 who testified on behalf of the AccusedAppellant Appellant served as a clerk in charge of salariesat the Regiment Headquarters of the Sri Lanka Army. Thewitness stated that he had brought along with him adocumentregardingtheAccusedAppellantAppellant

8

reporting to work on 10.09.2012. The witness stated thatevery month army officers are required to send a letter totheir divisional head regarding the number of days theyhad reported to work. The witness stated that he hadbrought along with him the true copy of such a letterreportingthattheAccusedAppellantAppellanthadreported to work on 10.09.2012 and marked as V1 afterwhichthe defense concluded their case. The witnessduringcrossexaminationstatedthattheAccusedAppellant Appellant had not taken part in the morningparadeonthedayinquestion.However,duringre-examination the witness testified that although theAccused Appellant Appellant had not taken part in themorning parade, if he reported to work thereafter it wouldbe reflected on the Register as he had reported to work onthat day.

Having considered the evidence at length led by both theprosecution and defense witnesses the learned Magistratedecided against the Accused Appellant Appellant.

The Learned Magistrate in her judgment stated that it isobvious that there had been no previous relationshipbetweentheAccusedAppellantAppellantandtheComplainant.During cross examination, the AccusedAppellant Appellant has admitted to signing the document(P1). If the Accused Appellant Appellant had signed anempty paper as he had claimed in hisoriginal testimonythen there was no hindrance for him to inform the policeof doing so at the point at which he was arrested. However,based on the testimony of PW4 (Police Sergeant) theAccused Appellant Appellant had not done so at any point.The Learned Magistrate stated that it is quite apparent

9

that the Accused Appellant Appellant was well aware of thecontents of the document P.01.

The Learned Magistrate noted that in the testimony of PW4it was stated the Accused Appellant Appellant had beencharged 10% interest by the Complainant for the borrowedamount however none of this was mentioned during thetestimonies of PW1 or PW2. The Learned Magistrate notedthatifthemoneyhadbeenobtainedwithinterestpaymentsthisshould have been raised during crossexamination of PW1 and PW2 and the first mention of theinterest payments was through the testimony of the PoliceSergeant (PW4).

The Learned Magistrate observed that the position takenup by the Accused Appellant Appellant is that he was notpresent at the Sampath Bank branch on the day inquestion as he was at work at the Panagoda Army Camp.Defense witness 03 testified that the Accused AppellantAppellant had not taken part in the morning parade on10.09.2009 and had not provided a medical certificate fornot participating in the parade. The Accused AppellantAppellant had participated in the morning parades for twodays before the day in question. The Accused AppellantAppellanttestifiedthatowingtoanaccidentwhichoccurred on 18.06.2009 and not being able to dress inuniform due to the injuries sustained from said accidentthe Accused Appellant Appellant was excused from themorningparades.Assuch,theLearnedMagistrateobserved that if it is true that he had been excused fromthe morning parades permanently then the documentpresented by the defense marked V1 shows only the datesreported to work by the Accused Appellant Appellant for

10

the month of September and that there is no reason forsomeone who has been excused permanently to be a partof the morning parade two days before the date of theincident. Therefore, the Learned Magistrate observed thatthe Accused Appellant Appellant had lied to the court inhis testimony.

The Learned Magistrate held that based on the evidenceand testimony provided in the trial, the Accused AppellantAppellant and the Husband of the Complainant (PW2) wereacquainted by serving together in the Sri Lanka Army andas such the transaction had taken place based on thetrust of that relationship. The Accused Appellant Appellantby not returning the amount borrowed as promised hastherebycommittedcriminalmisappropriation, criminalbreach of trust and cheating as alleged by the prosecutionandsentencedtheAccused Appellant Appellant to 6monthsrigorousimprisonmentandcompensationofRupees 100,000/-, if compensation is not paid 06 monthsimprisonment.

AggrievedbywhichtheAccusedAppellantAppellantappealed to the High Court of Gampaha. The Learned HighCourtJudgeofGamapaheldthatduringthecrossexaminationattrialtheAccusedAppellantAppellantadmitted to signing the document marked P1 and that theLearned Magistrate has after considering the entirety ofevidence led in the trial has correctly decided that thedocument marked P1 has been signed by the AccusedAppellant Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge ofGampaha by judgment dated 31.08.2017 set aside theconviction based on section 403 of the Penal Code, statingthat the elements of the charge had not been proved

11

beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution. However,the Learned High Court judge of Gampaha affirmed theconviction in respect of the remaining two charges basedon sections 386 and 389 of the penal code.

Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court of Gampaha,theAccusedAppellantAppellantbypetitiondated20.09.2017 sought special leave to appeal from this court.Accordingly this court granted special leave to appeal fromtheaforementionedjudgmentoftheHighCourtofGampaha.

In the written submissions of the Respondent Respondentit was submitted that the money was misappropriated bythe fact that it was not returned to the Complainantdespite multiple attempts made by her and her husband tohavethemoneyreturnedtothem.Itwasfurthersubmitted that this amounts to the Accused AppellantAppellant acting dishonestly and thus the actus reus andmens rea of both offenses have been established based onthe evidence.

I will proceed to address the question of law on whichspecial leave has been granted, namely that The LearnedHigh Court Judge has erred by failing to consider thebasic elements to prove charges of section 386 and389 of the Penal Code.

In order to answer the question of law I will first focus onthe definition of the offense of Criminal Misappropriationwhich is set out in section 386 of the Penal Code asfollows:

Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to hisown use any movable property shall be punished with

12

imprisonment of either description for a term which mayextend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

The Supreme Court held in the case of Barber v Abdulla[1920] 7C.W. R 144 that; in order to maintain a charge ofcriminal misappropriation, the prosecution need show onlythat the property belonged to some person other than theaccused.DeSampayoJtheoffenseofcriminalmisappropriation consists in the dishonest conversion to theuses of the party charged of the property of another. I do notthink it is absolutely necessary that the actual ownershould be disclosed in all cases. It may be sufficient if thereis some person entitled to the possession of the goodsmisappropriated.

In the written submission of the Respondent Respondent itis contended as per G.L Peiris, The Offences under thePenal Code of Sri Lanka 2nd Edition on page 453 Thecentral idea involved in the concepts of misappropriationand conversion is the setting apart property for the wrongperson or for the wrong purpose. The actus reus of theoffenserequiresthatthepropertyshouldbeusedorexploited for the benefit of some person who is not legallyentitled to the property.

Inthiscase,theProsecutionhasprovedbeyondareasonable doubt that the 2 million rupees belonged to thePW2 and the Accused Appellant Appellant by failing toreturn the amount borrowed has deprived the PW1 andPW2 of the benefit that could be derived from that amountof money.

13

The mens rea of the offence requires the element ofdishonest intention. Section 22 of the Penal Code definesdishonestly as follows:

Whoever does anything with the intention of causingwrongfulgain to one person, or wrongful loss toanother person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

Section 21 of the Penal Code defines wrongful gain andwrongful loss as follows:

Wrongful gain is gain by unlawful means of propertyto which the person gaining is not legally entitled.

Wrongfullossisthelossbyunlawfulmeansofpropertytowhichthepersonlosingitislegallyentitled.

Itwasthepreviousjudicialpositionthataninitialinnocent taking of the property followed by a guilty state ofmindatalaterstagewasrequired.Thisviewwasoverturned in the case of Attorney General Vs. Menthis[1960] 61 NLR 561 where Justice Sinnetamby Observedthat The main provisions of Section 386 make dishonestmisappropriation at any stage an offence; Explanation 2only provides for a special case where the initial taking ishonest and its intended to protect the finder of property notin the possession of anyone so long, and only so long, ashis continued possession of that property is honest. If, ofcourse, the property taken was in the possession of someperson the resulting offence would be theft. In my opinion,therefore in order to constitute misappropriation under ourlaw it is not necessary that there should be an innocent

14

initial taking. If the initial taking of the property not in thepossession of anyone is dishonest then too the offence ismade out. In regard to this, I agree with the view expressedby Justice Moseley in Salgado V. Mudali Pulle (supra).

Therefore, considering the evidence led at trial, the moneywas borrowed by the Accused Appellant Appellant in orderto facilitate money for a relative who was going abroad.TheundertakingofP1wassignedbytheAccusedAppellant Appellant at the point of borrowing, agreeing torepaythemoneyin laches. I note that no evidenceregarding the relative traveling abroad in respect of whomthemoney was borrowed has been led at trial. TheAccused Appellant Appellant stated during his testimonythat he did not sign P.01 at the point of borrowing,however he signed an empty paper at a later stage owing tothe constant pressure by PW1 and PW2 for the repaymentof the borrowed money. The Learned Magistrate in herjudgmentstatedthatifthepositionoftheAccusedAppellant Appellant is that he signed an empty paper at alater date, due to the pressure by PW1 and PW2 suchshould have been mentioned to the police at the point ofhis arrest.

According to the testimony of PW4 the officer who recordedthe statement of the Accused Appellant Appellant, nomention of such was made and the Accused AppellantAppellant had admitted that he did in fact sign thedocument marked P1 in his statement to PW4. ThereforetheLearnedMagistratecorrectlyconcludedthattheAccused Appellant Appellant had clear knowledge of thecontents of P1 at the point of signing and I am inagreement with this stance of the Learned Magistrate.

15

The position of the Accused Appellant Appellant is that onthe date concerned 10.09.2012, he was not present at theSampath Bank branch in Gampaha as he was at work atthe Panagoda Army Camp and has produced a witness toprove this point. The evidence of the witness and thedocument marked V1 shows that the Accused AppellantAppellant had not taken part in the morning parade on theday in question and had not provided a medical certificatefor not participating. However, the evidence of such awitness pointed out that the Accused Appellant Appellanthad participated in the morning parade two days prior tothe day in question. As such the Learned Magistrate hascorrectly observed that if it is true that he had beenexcused from the morning parades permanently, there isno reason for someone who has been excused permanentlyto be a part of the morning parade two days before thedate of the incident. I am in agreement with the LearnedMagistrate on this stance.

Further, the Accused Appellant Appellant has over a periodoftimesincetheborrowingofmoneyupuntilthebeginning of the trial on numerous occasions promised topay back the money however no such repayment has beenmade up to date. According to the statement made to thepolice by PW1, the Accused Appellant Appellant had beenavoiding PW1 in order to evade returning the money.Ibelieve that this transaction has been entered into by theparties purely based on trust which PW1 and PW2 hadwiththeAccusedAppellantAppellant.TheAccusedAppellant Appellant has therefore misled the parties into

16

believing that the money will be repaid. In failing to repaythe money the Accused Appellant Appellant has deprivedthe lawful owners of the money the benefits received fromsuch money. Therefore considering all of the above, Ibelieve that the prosecution has fulfilled the elementsrequired for both the actus reus and mens rea of thecriminal misappropriation as set out in section 386 of thePenal Code.

The definition of Criminal Breach of trust is set out insection 388 of the Penal Code as follows:

Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, orwithanydominionoverproperty,dishonestlymisappropriates or converts to his own use that property, ordishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation ofany direction of law prescribing the mode in which suchtrust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express orimplied, which he has made touching the discharge of suchtrust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits criminal breach of trust.

AssubmittedinthewrittensubmissionsoftheRespondentRespondentthatas per G.LPeiris,TheOffencesunderthePenalCodeofSriLanka2ndEdition on page 465 The definition of the offence ofcriminal breach of trust, embodied in the section 388 of thePenal Code requires proof of the following elements:

1. Theaccusedwasinanymannerentrustedwithproperty or with any dominion over property;2. The accused committed one of the following acts;

17

a. He misappropriated or converted to his own use

that property; orb. He used or disposed that property in violation of

any direction of law prescribing the mode in whichsuch trust is to be discharged; orc. He used or disposed of that property in violation of

any legal contract, expressed or implied, which hemade touching the discharge of such trust; ord. He suffered any other person to do so; and

3. The accused committed one of the first three actsdishonestly or the fourth act willfully.

In the case of Basnayake v Officer in Charge, SpecialCrimes Detection Unit, Anuradhapura [1998] 2 SLR p50 the inference of dishonesty was discussed and it washeld that the inference of dishonest misappropriation orconversion is an essential ingredient of the offence under s.391 of the Penal Code.

In the Indian case of Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v TheState of Bombay [1956] AIR 575,1956 SCR 483 it washeld that section 405 which defines "criminal breach oftrust" speaks of a person being in any manner entrustedwith property, it does not contemplate the creation of a trustwith all the technicalities of the law of trust. It contemplatesthe creation of a relationship whereby the owner of propertymakes it over to another person to be retained by him until acertain contingency arises or to be disposed of by him onthe happening of a certain event. The person who transferspossession of the property to the second party still remainsthe legal owner of the property and the person in whose

18

favour possession is so transferred has only the custody ofthe property to be kept or disposed of by him for the benefitof the other party, the person so put in possession onlyobtaining a special interest by way of a claim for moneyadvanced or spent upon the safe keeping of the thing orsuch other incidental expenses as may have been incurredby him.

The same view was followed in the case of Walgamage vAttorney General 2000 3 SLR p 1 where it was held thatentrustment does not contemplate the creation of a trustwith all the technicalities of the law of trusts; it includes thedeliveryofpropertytoanothertobedealtwithinaccordancewithanarrangementmade either then orpreviously.

Basedontheabovementionedjudgmentsthedistinguishing feature between criminal misappropriationandcriminalbreachoftrustistheentrustmentofproperty. The language used in section 388 is rather wideand states that entrustment of property in any manner isthe necessary requirement.

Therefore, considering the facts and evidence led at thetrial, it is quite evident that the Complainant has enteredinto this transaction with the Accused Appellant Appellantpurely based on trust based on the relationship thatexistedbetweenPW2andtheAccusedAppellantAppellant.Therehadbeennoprevioustransactionsbetween the parties prior to this occasion. The AccusedAppellant Appellant borrowed the money from PW1 on thebasis that he required the money in order to furnish the

19

same as proof of funds to send a relative abroad. As perthe testimonies of both PW1 and PW2, they were bothreluctant at first to provide the money however due toconstant requests by the Accused Appellant Appellantagreed to provide the money on the promise that it wouldbe returned in one month. Therefore, by agreementtoprovide the money to the Accused Appellant Appellant wasbased on the promise that it would be repaid in onemonth's time. On such promise the Complainant had beenentrusted with 2 Million Rupees for the period of onemonth to be repaid in tranches. Numerous promises hadbeen made thereafter to repay the amount however nopayments had been made up to the date of trial. It isimportant to note that a period of one year had elapsedbefore PW1 and PW2 had proceeded to initiate any actionagainst the Accused Appellant Appellant owing to the trustplaced on the promises made by the Accused AppellantAppellant to repay the money.Therefore the element ofentrustment as required by section 388 of the Penal Codehas been satisfied. By the non repayment of the borrowedamount and by dishonestly converting the property to hisown use and by depriving the owner of its benefits, theAccused Appellant Appellant has satisfied the elements ofactus reus and mens rea required under section 388 of thePenal Code.

Having considered all above, I am of the view that thelearned High Court Judge had come to a correct conclusionthat the prosecution had proved all the elements requiredto maintain a charge under section 386 and 389 of the

20

Penal Code in the case against the Accused AppellantAppellant.

Accordingly, I answer the question of law on which specialleave to appeal has been granted in the negative. For thesereasons, the Judgment of the High Court ofGampaha isaffirmed. The Appeal of the Accused Appellant Appellant ishereby dismissed.
