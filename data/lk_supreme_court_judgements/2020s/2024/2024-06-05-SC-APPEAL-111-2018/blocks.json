Therefore, by agreementtoprovide the money to the Accused Appellant Appellant wasbased on the promise that it would be repaid in onemonth's time. On such promise the Complainant had beenentrusted with 2 Million Rupees for the period of onemonth to be repaid in tranches. Numerous promises hadbeen made thereafter to repay the amount however nopayments had been made up to the date of trial. It isimportant to note that a period of one year had elapsedbefore PW1 and PW2 had proceeded to initiate any actionagainst the Accused Appellant Appellant owing to the trustplaced on the promises made by the Accused AppellantAppellant to repay the money.Therefore the element ofentrustment as required by section 388 of the Penal Codehas been satisfied. By the non repayment of the borrowedamount and by dishonestly converting the property to hisown use and by depriving the owner of its benefits, theAccused Appellant Appellant has satisfied the elements ofactus reus and mens rea required under section 388 of thePenal Code.",
