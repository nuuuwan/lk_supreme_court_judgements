"According to the Petitioner, by letter dated 08.03.2015 [P2(a)], he made a request to the"
"1st Respondent for official quarters due to difficulties in travelling. Consequent to another"
"appeal made to the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner was informed that a committee will"

"official quarters deemed that the letter is averse to his interests and to the utter surprise"
"and dismay of the Petitioner, tore the letter."

"patient who attended the hospital to receive medication. The Petitioner was directed to"
"provide  reasons  to  exonerate  himself  from  the  allegations  within  three  days.  The"
"Petitioner submitted his reply by letter dated 01.12.2016 [P5(b)]."
