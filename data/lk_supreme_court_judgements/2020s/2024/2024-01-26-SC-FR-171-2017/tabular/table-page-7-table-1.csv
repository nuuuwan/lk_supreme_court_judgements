"In K. P. K. L. P. Maduwanthi v. S. M. G. K. Perera, District Secretary and Others (supra.),"
"the request to transfer the petitioner in that case was made to facilitate an investigation"
"into alleged misconduct. I held that the conduct of such an investigation is part of the"
"administrative functions of the Public Service and hence such a transfer was in accordance"
"with the PSC Rules."
"I observe that the 2nd Respondent has, in letter dated 07.12.2016 [5R3] made a request to"
"the 5th Respondent to transfer the Petitioner to a place outside his purview. It is further"
"suggested  that  an  inquiry  be  held  in  relation  to  several  matters  referred  to  therein"
"including the incident on 30.11.2016."
"The  Acting  Director  General  of  Health  Services  had  made  a  minute  dated  07.12.2016"
"thereon  to  transfer  the  Petitioner  and  hold  an  inquiry.  Hence,  it  is  arguable  that  the"
"transfer given to the Petitioner falls within Rule 218 (iii) of the PSC Rules."
"Nevertheless, no such inquiry had commenced by the time this application was filed on"
"12th May 2017. The affidavit of the then holder of office of the 5th Respondent filed in this"
"case  is  dated  10th  September  2019.  It  does  not  refer  to  any  inquiry  commenced  or"
"concluded as suggested by the Acting Director General of Health Services."
"Hence, I am inclined to accept the submission made by Ms. Wijenarayana, learned counsel"
"for the Petitioner that the transfer of the Petitioner was not to facilitate the conducting of"
"an inquiry into the allegations made against the Petitioner."
"This finding is supported upon an examination of the specific and detailed allegations of"
"malice made against the 2nd Respondent by the Petitioner. The 2nd Respondent has failed"
"to file an affidavit responding to these allegations though notice was served on him and"
"being represented in the proceedings.  This is further corroborated by the fact that the"
"minute made by the then Director General of Health Services in P8 [dated 02.01.2017],"
"directing that the Petitioner be reinstated at the previous hospital, has been disregarded."
