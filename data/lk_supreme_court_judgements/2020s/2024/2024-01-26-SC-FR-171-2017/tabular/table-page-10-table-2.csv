"[(2003) 1 Sri.L.R. 222], Court was called upon to examine the legality of a transfer order."
"Fernando J. held (at page 227):"
"“While the 2nd Respondent had authority to transfer the Petitioner on one or more"
"of the grounds stated above, there is no proof that he did actually make a transfer"
"order. Even assuming that he did make a transfer order, there is no evidence as to"
"the basis on which he acted, and it cannot be assumed that it was on one of the"
"four permitted grounds. But even if I were to assume that he did act on one of those"
"grounds,  yet  that  ground  and  the  supporting  reasons  were  not  disclosed  to  the"
"Petitioner  when  the  transfer  order  was  made,  and  even  when  his  appeals  were"
"refused and that was a fatal flaw…In the present case, not only the reasons but"
"even  the  ground  had  not  been  disclosed.  I  therefore  hold  that  the  Petitioner's"
"transfer was wrongful and arbitrary.”"
