"and/or that boundaries were marked and demarcated or that the 9 lms 1½ kls land was carved"
"out of the larger land."
"Thus, even if the Appellant possessed, the ‘eastern half of the western side half of the"
"larger land’, referred to as Nampithavathai, (as referred to in the Plaint), the learned judge held"
"that the said 9 lms 1½ kls land is not a defined lot, but a part of the larger land. Therefore,"
"when the 2nd Respondent intended to sell her interest in the 9 lms 1½ kls land, from and out of"
"the larger land, the right of pre-emption could be exercised by any co-owner of the larger land."
"I
n the aforesaid circumstances, the trial judge came to the conclusion, that the Appellant"
"has failed to establish that the course of action initiated by the 2nd Respondent to transfer her"
"1/6th interest in the 9 lms 1½ kls land to the 3rd and 4th Respondents, is erroneous or faulty"
"and/or will have no force in law."
"F
urthermore, it was the view of the trial judge that the Appellant has no right to institute"
"the instant action and obtain relief, and thus dismissed the Plaint filed before the District Court"
"with costs."
"B
eing  aggrieved  by  the  said  finding,  the  Appellant  went  before  the  High  Court."
"Consequent to the hearing of the appeal, the learned Commissioners of the High Court, saw"
"no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial judge and dismissed the appeal."
"I
t is observed that the trial at the District Court of Paruthithurai, was conducted in the"
"Tamil language and had been heard before a single judge, within a span of four years and the"
"judgement written in Tamil, running into over twenty pages had been delivered by the same"
"trial  judge.  Furthermore,  the  evidence  led  before  the  trial  court  and  the  contents  of  the"
"numerous deeds, had been considered, examined and analysed by the trial judge, in coming to"
"his conclusion, especially in respect of the findings pertaining to the ‘disputed land’ being the"
"larger land in extent of 35 lachams, and is supported by good reasons."
"I
  have  considered  the  evidence  led  before  the  trial  court,  the  submissions  filed  and"
"especially the submissions made by the learned Presidents’ Counsel before this Court and I am"
"convinced that the Appellant has failed to establish that the disputed land was a land in extent"
"9 lms 1½ kls. Furthermore, I accept the contention of the Respondents, that the disputed land"
"is the larger land and that the 3rd and 4th Respondents are co-owners of such land."
"T
hus, I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned trial judge. I also see"
"no reason to deviate from the impugned judgement of the learned Commissioners of the Civil"
"Appellate High Court of Jaffna."
"F
urthermore, I am of the view that the High Court was not in error in proceeding to"
"affirm the judgement of the District Court pertaining to the extent of the 9 lms 1½ kls land,"
"being an undivided portion of a larger land in extent 35 lachams."
