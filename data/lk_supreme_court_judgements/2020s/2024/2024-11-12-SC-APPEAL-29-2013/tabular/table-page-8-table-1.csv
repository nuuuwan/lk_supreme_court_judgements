"The Appellant’s contention relating to the disputed land is that it is a  land in extent"
"9 lms 1½ kls and forms a divided portion, of the land called ‘Nampithavathai’, whereas the"
"Respondents take up the position that the disputed land is an undivided portion of the larger"
"land  referred  to  in  the  Schedule  of  the  Plaint,  in  an  extent  of  35  lachams.    However,  the"
"Schedule of the Answer refers to the extent of the disputed land as 29 lachams."
"T

"If I may use another phraseology, the Appellant refers to the 9 lachams 1½ kullis land"
"as  a  separetly  demarcated,  independent  block  of  land,  co-owned  by  the  Appellant,  the  2nd"
"Respondent  and  another  but  not  the  3rd  and  4th  Respondents,  whereas  the  Respondent’s"
"contention is that the 9 lachams 1½ kullis land is not an independent block of land, as alleged"
"and had never been surveyed or partitioned, and as such it is not a separately carved out or"

"owned by the Appellant, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents and others. The Appellant refers to"
"the larger land as a land in extent of 35 lms, whereas the Respondents refer to such land as a"
"land in extent of 29 lms."
"I  wish  to  refer  to  Section  4  of  the  Pre-Emption  Ordinance  at  this  stage.  It  reads  as"
