"Let me now move onto examine the 2nd and 5th Questions of Law."
"T
he 2nd Question is based on the assumption that the High Court, while accepting the"
"Appellant’s contention that the deed by which the 2nd Respondent’s interests were transferred"
"to  the  3rd  and  4th  Respondents,  was  a  deed  of  conditional  transfer  and  therefore,  was  not  a"
"genuine act but was executed only to circumvent the provisions of the Pre-Emption Ordinance,"
"erred in concluding that the provisions of the Pre-Emption Ordinance will not be applicable to"
"a conditional transfer."
"T
he  Appellant  drew  our  attention  to  the  cases  of  Thamu  Ponnaiah  v.  Velupillai"
"Ponniah 60 NLR 415 and Saravanamuttu et al v. Vallipuram et al 50 NLR 12 to justify"
"the said contention."
"I
n the aforesaid Thamu Ponnaiah case it was held, that a court is entitled to look into"
"the transactions and decide whether the exchange is in fact a sale, for the purposes of the Pre-"
"Emption Ordinance. In the Saravanamuttu case, referred to above, the ratio decidendi was"
"that a person who takes a transfer of a share from a co-owner, subject to the condition that he"
"should re-transfer it on payment of a certain sum within a stipulated period, is also a co-owner"
"and is entitled to the rights of pre-emption. I have no hesitation in accepting the said decisions."
"A court is entitled and should look into the entirety of circumstances and come to a correct"
"finding."
"H
owever, as discussed earlier in this judgement, we have already held that the disputed"
"land  in  extent  9  lms  1½  kls,  is  not  a  divided  land  as  submitted  by  the  Appellant,  but  an"
"undivided portion of a larger land in extent 35 lacham, which was co-owned by all the relevant"
"parties namely, the Appellant, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents."
"T
hus,  the  3rd  and  4th  Respondents  being  co-owners  of  the  35  lacham  land,  could"
"purchase  the  1/6th  interest  of  the  2nd  Respondent  without  a  hindrance.  Such  a  sale  will  not"
"contravene the provisions of the Pre-Emption Ordinance. Hence, in my view, whether such"
"transfer is absolute, conditional or unconditional is immaterial. It has no bearing to the matter"
"under consideration. The 3rd and 4th Respondents, on their own right could purchase the said"
"interest."
"H
ence, I do not wish to get into an academic discourse relating to the Law of Contract"
"vis-â-vis Law of Pre-Emption or to examine the applicability of a deed of conditional transfer"
"on the law of pre-emption. Nor do I wish to ascertain whether the transfer of the interest by"
"Deed No. 4721 (P6) in the instant matter was fictitious in nature, vexatious or executed in bad"
"faith. Similarly, it is not necessary to discuss the applicability of the time lines in Section 8 of"
"the Pre-Emption Ordinance on a hypothetical conditional transfer situation."
"I
n any event, the 5th Question of Law raised before this Court, shed light to the fact,"
"that the 1/6th interest of the 2nd Respondent on the disputed land disposed by Deed P6, was"
"subsequently re-transferred to the 2nd Respondent by Deed No. 7687 (P7) after fullfilling the"
