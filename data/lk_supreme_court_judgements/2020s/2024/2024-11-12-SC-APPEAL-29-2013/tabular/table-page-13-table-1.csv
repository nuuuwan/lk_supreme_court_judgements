"share of the 2nd Respondent, but only objected to the sale to the 3rd Respondent, upon the basis"
"that the 3rd Respondent is not a co-owner of the disputed land. Furthermore, the Appellant has"
"not  tendered  the  amount  stated  in  the  notice  of  sale  and  has  thus,  failed  to  act  in  terms  of"
"Section 6(1) of the Ordinance."
"M
oreover, this Court has already held, having analysed the impugned  District Court"
"and High Court judgements, that the disputed land is not the 9 lms 1½ kls land, but the larger"
"land in extent of 35 lachams. The said larger land is co-owned by the Appellant, the 2nd, 3rd"
"and 4th Respondents. Thus, I am of the view, since 3rd and 4th Respondents are also co-owners,"
"by only tendering P4, the Appellant cannot gain an advantage. Hence, P4 has no force in law."
"It is only a letter of protest. It has no value and it does not fall within the parameters of Section"
"6 of the Pre-Emption Ordinance. Thus, I am of the view, that the Appellant has failed to invoke"
"the right to pre-empt, guaranteed under the Pre-Emption Ordinance."
"I
n any event by P4, the Appellant has not offered a sum to purchase the 1/6th interest of"
"the  2nd  Respondent.  Hence,  the  Appellant  cannot  now  make  out  a  case  of  fatal  irregularity"
"under the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Pre-Emption Ordinance, to obtain relief as prayed"
"for  in  the  Petition  of  Appeal  filed  before  this  Court.  Similarly,  the  Appellant  cannot  now,"
"mount an attack on the deed of transfer P6 and contend that it is a nullity and thus, should be"
"declared null and void."
"I
n the aforesaid circumstances, there is no merit in the submissions of the Appellant,"
"that the High Court erred in failing to consider the submissions of the Appellant, that the trial"
"judge was in grave error in holding that the Respondents had complied with the provisions of"
"the Pre-Emption Ordinance, in relation to the notice of intention. Similarly, there is no merit"
"in the submission of the Appellant that the sale of the 1/6th interest of the 2nd Respondent to"
"the 3rd and 4th Respondents, by Deed No. 4721 dated 21-07-2018 (P6) should be declared null"
"and void."
"H
ence, I answer the 4th Question of Law raised before this Court in the negative and"
"in favour of the Respondents."
"H
aving answered the 1st and 4th Questions of Law, let me now examine the 3rd Question"
"of Law. It is raised on the basis that in the notice of intention (P3) given by the 2nd Respondent,"
"the land is referred to as 9 lms 1½ kls. Hence, the contention of the Appellant is that the said"
"reference  itself  proves  that  9  lms  1½  kls  is  a  defined  portion  which  gives  credence  to  the"
"Appellant’s submission, that she has a right of  pre-emption over the head of the 3rd and 4th"
"Respondents. Such contention, in my view, is erroneous."
"W
hen considering the 1st and 4th Questions of Law, this Court analysed in detail the"
"evidence and the words used in describing the land, i.e., the 9 lms 1½ kls land as an undivided"
"portion  of  a  larger  land  in  extent  35  lachams  and  came  to  the  finding,  that  the  High  Court"
"Commissioners  did  not  err  in  their  judgement.  In  my  view,  the  3rd  Question  of  Law  is"
"intertwined  with  the  1st  and  4th  Questions  and  therefore,  the  3rd  Question  of  Law  too,  is"
"answered in the negative and in favour of the Respondents."
