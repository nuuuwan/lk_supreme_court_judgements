Section 2 of the Ordinance speaks of the persons to whom the right of preference should be given, namely co-owners and heirs. Section 4 refers to an undivided share or interest in immovable property and Section 5 describes the mode of publication of notice.",

Section 7 lays down the procedure to be followed, in the event a vendor fails to adhere to the provisions of the law. Section 8 refers to the remedy, in the event the sale is complete and Section 9 the time limit for actions to be instituted for enforcing a right. Section 10 speaks of registration of a lis pendens being compulsory, for enforcing a right of pre-emption, Section 11 refers to deposit of purchase money as proof of a plaintiffs bona-fides. Section 13 specifically states that all co-owners and heirs shall be deemed to have an equal right to pre-empt and that there shall be no preference or precedence among them. The Appeal before the Supreme Court The genesis of this Appeal, was the institution of a case in the District Court, upon the basis that the Appellant was a co-owner of the disputed land, holding an undivided 1/3rd interest. The Appellants grievance was that the 2nd Respondent, another co-owner sold her 1/6th share of the disputed land, to the 3rd and 4th Respondents, who were neither heirs nor co-owners to the disputed land, without granting the Appellant, the co-owner, the right to pre-empt to purchase the 2nd Respondents said 1/6th interest of the disputed land.",
