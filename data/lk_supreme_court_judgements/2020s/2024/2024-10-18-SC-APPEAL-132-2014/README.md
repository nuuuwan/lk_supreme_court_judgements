Argued on: 02/07/2024

Decided on: 18/10/2024

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[01] The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant instituted this action to partition the land called

Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita in extent 1 Rood and 27 perches (A.0 R.1

P.27) depicted in Surveyor Generals title Plan No. 183522 dated 04/10/1899, and

morefully described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint dated 12/03/1990. The

Plaintiff-Appellants claim was based on a Crown Grant given in the year 1900.

However, there was no reference to any plan depicting the said corpus as described

in the schedule to the Plaint. A Preliminary Plan of the land sought to be partitioned

was appended to the Amended Plaint and in that the Plaintiffs have given undivided

rights to the Plaintiffs and to the 1st to 6th Defendants.

[02] The 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th, and 9th contesting Defendants-Appellants-Respondents in their

joint Amended Statement of Claim dated 10/09/1990 took up the position that Lots

Nos. 1 and 2 depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 123 dated 16/05/1987 made by

Michel J. Silva Licensed Surveyor marked X, and the corresponding report

Page 9 of 22

marked X1, in extent of One Rood and Twenty Seven decimal Three Eight Five

Perches (A.0 R.1 P.27.385) is a different land called Malapawulaowita alias

Indigahaowita and sought a dismissal of the partition action. The Defendants-

Respondents contend that in the absence of convincing evidence, the learned

District Judge could not have decided with certainty the identity of the corpus and

it was incumbent upon the trial court to ascertain the correctness of boundaries,

demarcations of limits between owners of contiguous land deeds by landmarks,

witnesses etc.

[03] All contesting Defendants-Respondents are challenging the identity of the corpus

and are relying on a separate chain of title to the land called Malapawulaowita alias

Indigahaowita commencing from the year 1947, registered in a separate folio. The

Defendants-Respondents set out a pedigree, pursuant to the deeds they have

submitted.

[04] Therefore, the substantial issue to be resolved in this action is whether the corpus

sought to be partitioned is Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita as submitted by the

Plaintiff-Appellant or Malapawulaowita alias Indigahaowita as is the position of the

contesting Defendants-Respondents.

[05] The learned District Judge by Judgment dated 13/11/2000, held in favor of the

Plaintiffs and allowed the partition of the land depicted in Preliminary Plan No. 123

(X) dated 16/05/1987 made by Michel J. Silva, Licensed Surveyor.

[06] The Court of Appeal by Judgment dated 30/07/2008, set aside the Judgment of the

District Court, essentially on the basis that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish the

identity of the corpus.

[07] I will now briefly deal with the devolution of title relied upon by the Plaintiff-

Appellant and the Defendants-Respondents. It is observed that the Court of Appeal

has not specifically reversed the findings of the learned District Judge with regard

to the devolution of title set out by either party.

Page 10 of 22

The devolution of title relied upon by the Plaintiff-Appellant

[08] According to the pedigree set out in the Plaint, Kathriarachchige Don Samel who

lived in the land to be partitioned for over 80 years, claimed ownership by long

continued possession. The said Samel by Deed No. 2794 dated 22/08/1939 (P5),

conveyed his title to Kaththriarachchige Don Charlis. Don Charlis by Deed No.

6368 dated 19/07/1947 (P6), conveyed title to Kathriarachchige Don Simeon. Don

Simeon by Deed No. 4184 dated 10/06/1951 (P7), transferred title to

Kathriarachchige Dona Aljinahamy. Dona Aljinahamy by Deed No. 14270 dated

02/08/1960 (P8), has conveyed title to Sendanayakaachchige Don Karunarathna

(the 2nd Defendant). The said Don Karunarathna by Deed No. 20489 dated

12/09/1966 (P9), conveyed his title to Don Karlinahamy who died unmarried and

issueless.

[09] Karlinahamys rights devolved on her deceased brother Don Heralis Singho to an

undivided share and the balance share to her deceased sister Dona Aljinahamys

children Dona Gunawathie, Don Karunarathne, Dona Premawathie and Dona

Kusumalatha (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants respectively) in equal shares.

Heralis Singho died leaving his heirs, his widow Dona Ransohamy an undivided

1/4th share (the 1st Plaintiff), and an undivided 1/12th share each to Don Wijeratne,

Dona Somawathie, and Dona Nandawathie (the 2nd Plaintiff and 5th and 6th

Defendants).

[10] It is submitted that there were two houses and a cultivation belonging to Dona

Karlinahamy within the said corpus, and that her brother Singho who lived in one

of the houses predeceased her and Dona Premawathie has taken possession of the

house and rented it. In 1985, Diyalape Munasinghe Arachchige Peter (7th

Defendant) came into possession of the said house claiming title to the portion of

the land in which the said house is situated.

Page 11 of 22

The devolution of title relied upon by the Defendants-Respondents

[11] The Preliminary Plan No. 123 dated 16/05/1987 (X), made by Surveyor Michel J.

Silva, refers to the land Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita which is bounded on

the North by the land claimed by U.A. Don Martin Munasinghe (State Plan No. CO

283), on the East by the road from Horana to Colombo and Mahakumbura claimed

by G. Alpanis and others, on the South by, Mahakumbura claimed by G. Alpanis

and others and Mahakumbure ela, and on the West by, Mahakumbure ela, and land

claimed by U.A Don Martin Munasinghe (State Plan No. CO 283), in extent of One

Rood and Twenty Seven decimal Three Eight Five Perches (A0-R1-P27.385). The

position of the Defendants-Respondents is that the land depicted in the Preliminary

Plan No. 123, made by Michel J. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor dated the 16/05/1987

is Malapaulaowita alias Indigahaowita and not the land sought to be partitioned by

the Plaintiff-Appellant, as it appears in the schedule to the Plaint. In their schedule

to the answer, the Defendants-Respondents identify the corpus as Malpaulaowita

alias Indigahaowita bounded on the North by, Mampe Owita, East by a road leading

to Rathnapura, South by Maddage Owita and West by Dombagaha Kumbura, in

extent of around three bushels.

[12] The Defendants have appended a pedigree of their own, which shows the devolution

of title to the land described morefully in the Schedule to the Answer. In the said

pedigree it is contended that Dewage alias Kaththriarachchige Nonahamy has

inherited the said land in extent of three bushels through maternal and paternal

inheritance and her rights were devolved on the parties referred to, as pleaded in

their Statement of Claim.

[13] Accordingly, the said Nonahamy has conveyed title to an undivided 3/4th share of

the corpus along with the house situated towards the southern boundary, which is

described as a house with asbestos roofing sheets to Suraweera Arachchige Dona

Karlinahamy and the remaining undivided 1/4th share along with the house towards

the northern boundary, described as a small house with zinc sheets to Suraweera

Page 12 of 22

Arachchige Dona Aljinahamy, her daughters, by Deed of Transfer No. 6389 dated

01/08/1947 (1V1). Thereafter, by Deed No. 14269 dated 02/08/1960 (P14), Dona

Aljinahamy transferred her entitlement to Dona Gunawathie (1st Defendant) while

Dona Karlinahamy by Deed No. 22498 dated 01/08/1968 (1V2), transferred her

share to Dona Gunawathie.

[14] Dona Gunawathie by Deed No. 25970 dated 27/11/1978 (1V4), transferred an

undivided share and the house bearing No. 238 to Dona Premawathie and by Deed

No. 25971 dated 27/11/1978 (1V5), an undivided share and the newly built house

with roofing sheets was transferred to Nandika Pinto Jayawardane (the 8th

Defendant). Dona Premawathie by Deed No. 6608 dated 09/11/1985 (1V6)

transferred her title to Joslin Athukorale the 9th Defendant, who presently occupies

the said house No. 238.

[15] The Defendants-Respondents in their written submissions tendered to the trial court

state that the 1st Defendant Dona Gunawathie has clearly identified the land

surveyed by Plan No. 123 (X) as the land described in the schedule to the Statement

of Claim. The Defendants relied upon title deeds marked 1V1 to 1V6 to establish

that Dona Gunawathie was in possession of the said land since Karalinahamy and

Aljinahamy transferred their rights to her in 1968.

[16] It is the evidence of the Surveyor that the land depicted in Preliminary Plan No. 123

(X) is the land that is sought to be partitioned and it is the same land that is depicted

in title Plan No. 183522. It is also his evidence that Lots 1 and 2 depicted in

Preliminary Plan No. 123 encapsulates the corpus that the Plaintiffs-Appellants

seeks to partition, and that the superimposition of Plan No. PP Co. 283 was carried

out to locate the northern boundary to identify the lands which belongs to the State.

The Surveyor, superimposed title Plan No. 183522 marked P1 and 183505 on the

said Preliminary Plan No. 123, (X), and produced Plan No. 468, marked Y, and

the report marked Y1.

Page 13 of 22

[17] The learned District Court Judge was of the view that the land described in the

schedule to the Amended Plaint depicted as Lots 1 and 2, in Preliminary Plan No.

123 (X) and the buildings marked as A, B, C, D and F belongs to the said

Karlinahamy. Based on the said superimposition the trial court came to the finding

that the land depicted in Preliminary Plan No. 123 and Plan No. 183522 is one and

the same, therefore the corpus to be partitioned has been sufficiently identified. The

trial court was of the view that the title deeds tendered by the Defendants did not

correspond to the Preliminary Plan (X), or sufficiently identify the corpus to the

satisfaction of the evidence placed before court. The learned District Judge having

analyzed the evidence came to the conclusion that title deeds tendered by the

Plaintiffs are not challenged in evidence and therefore the pedigree relied upon by

the Plaintiffs can be accepted.

[18] In support of the findings of the trial court, the Plaintiff-Appellant in the written

submissions filed in this Court submits that the land surveyed and depicted in the

said Plan No. 123 (X), made by Surveyor Michel J. Silva, is the land sought to be

partitioned and that Lots 1 and 2 of the said Plan constitutes the corpus.

[19] It is contended that the evidence given by the Surveyor, relied upon by the trial court

was essentially to show that no State land was included in the corpus. Plan No. 468

(Y) made by the same Surveyor, shows the superimposition of title Plan Nos.

183522 and 183505. According to the report marked Y1, an accumulation of 8

Lots are marked as Lots 1 to 8 in Plan No. 183522.

[20] The Plaintiffs-Appellants do not dispute the fact that Plan No. 183505 was

superimposed to ascertain the accuracy of the northern boundary of the corpus

which was to ensure that no part of State land is included within the corpus.

[21] With reference to the evidence, the Plaintiff-Appellant submits that having

superimposed Plan No. 183505, the Surveyor came to the conclusion that the lands

Page 14 of 22

depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X) and the land depicted in title Plan No.

183522 are one and the same.

[22] It is strongly contended that the Court of Appeal erred when it mistakenly

considered title Plan No. 183505 as the corpus sought to be partitioned, which the

Plaintiff-Appellant submits to be clearly not within the corpus and is not the corpus

sought to be partitioned in this case. It is also the contention of the Plaintiff-

Appellant that the Court of Appeal failed to recognize that Deed Nos. 14269 and

14270 are connected to the corpus, which establishes beyond doubt that there are

two separate lands called Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita and

Malapawulaowita alias Indigahaowita.

[23] In this background it is important to note that, the learned District Judge has

definitively stated that the corpus described in Plan No. 468 (Y), is the same corpus

described in Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X). It is also the finding of the District Court

that by superimposing Plan No. 183522 (P1) on Plan No. 468 (Y), the corpus to be

partitioned has been identified. The court was of the view that even though the

village boundaries in Plan No. 183522 (P1) were not found and could not be

identified with the superimposition, the boundaries were satisfactorily identified.

[24] As observed earlier in this Judgment, the Plaintiffs obtained a court commission

therein, Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X) dated 24/09/1987 was prepared by Michel J.

Silva, Licensed Surveyor. The same Surveyor, superimposed title Plan No. 183522

and 183505 on the said Preliminary Plan (X) and, Plan No. 468 (Y) was prepared.

In Plan No. 468 (Y) the land is described as Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita

bounded on the North by Part of the land claimed by U.A Don Martin Munsainghe

in Plan No. 183505, on the East by Colombo - Horana Road, on the South by part

of the land claimed by J. Athukorala and also Mahakumbura claimed by Alpenis and

others and Mahakumbura Ela, on the West by Mahakumbure Ela and part of the land

claimed by U.A. Don Martin Munasinghe and A. Don Wijeratne by Plan No.

183505, depicted as Lots 1 to 8, in extent One Rood and Twenty-Seven Perches

Page 15 of 22

(A0-R1-P27). In the said superimposition Plan No. 183505 assumes no lesser

significance than Plan No. 183522, since it was essentially carried out to locate the

northern boundary to identify the lands which belongs to the State.

[25] Plan No. 183522 (P1), which identified the corpus to be partitioned as described in

the schedule to the Plaint, made by the Surveyor General dated the 04/10/1899,

refers to a land called Indigahaowita or Puwakgahaowita in Mampe village, Palle

Pattu, Salpiti Korale, Colombo District in the Western Province bounded on the

North by, title Plan No. 183505, on the East by a road and title Plan No. 182718, on

the South by land claimed by the villagers, and on the West by a land also claimed

by the villagers, in extent of One Rood and Twenty Seven perches (A0-R1-P27).

[26] At paragraph 7 of the report dated 24/09/1987 (X1), the Surveyor, has identified the

said land as the corpus to be partitioned. The buildings marked as A, B, C, D, and F

in Lots 1 and 2 were identified as belonging to Karlinahamy.

[27] According to the Surveyors evidence and the report Y1, changes in the corpus were

observed pursuant to the making of Plan No. 468 (Y) therein, the Colombo Road on

the eastern boundary of Lots 1 and 2 had been widened and the potion of land taken

over for the said road widening is depicted as Lot 4 in the said Plan No. 468 (Y), in

extent 2.83 perches.

[28] During the cross examination, the Surveyor revealed that the southern boundary in

Plan No. 183522 is identified as a village boundary, however, in the superimposed

Plan No. 468 (Y), it is identified as Mahakumbure Ela, which creates an uncertainty

in identifying the southern boundary. Even after observing the said infirmities, in

Report marked Y1, the Surveyor is of the view that the boundaries of the land to

be partitioned as described by the plaintiff has been satisfactorily identified as one

and the same land.

[29] The Surveyor was of the view that there was a need to superimpose the northern

boundary due to the existence of State Plan No. 283 and accordingly, to identify

Page 16 of 22

whether any part of the land to be partitioned encroached the State land. He further

stated that in title Plan No. 183522, the southern boundary is given as a village

boundary as identified by the villagers. It is noted that Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X)

does not show the southern and western boundaries as a village boundary as shown

in the title Plan No. 183522. Having surveyed the land, the southern boundary was

identified as a canal. Furthermore, it is observed that the canal shown as

Mahakumbure Ela is a fixed permanent boundary. However, no such boundary

has been shown in the title Plan No. 183522, and there is no evidence that the said

Ela was constructed in recent times, or that the village boundary was replaced by

the Ela. This position was admitted during the cross examination of the Surveyor.

[30] In these circumstances it is the contention of the Defendants-Respondents that

Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X) does not in any way establish that the said land

depicted in the title Plan No. 183522 is one and the same land.

[31] The Surveyor in his report, Y1 states that, since he was not satisfied with the

northern boundary of Lot 1 in Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X), identified at the

preliminary survey, with the land described in the schedule to the Plaint, and the

superimposition of State Plan Co. 283, Surveyor Generals Plan No. 183505 was

used to ascertain the correctness of the northern boundary.

[32] At Paragraph 10 of the said report Y1, the superimposition of Plan No. 183505 on

Plan No. 468 (Y), had shown that the northern boundary tallies only up to 54%, the

eastern boundary does not tally at all, the southern boundary tallies only up to 52%,

while the western boundary tallies only up to 29%. At paragraph 10:4 it is observed

that on an average the boundaries tally only up to 47.3% with the title plans. The

court commissioner clearly states that the boundaries of the land surveyed by him

do not agree with the boundaries described in Plan No. 183505.

Page 17 of 22

[33] On the identity of boundaries, the Court of Appeal stated that;

It must be bone [sic] in mind that the Surveyor was cross examined at length,

which creates doubts about identity but one should be mindful of the fact that the

Survey done in Plan P1 is over 100 year [sic] old. There is bound to be changes on

ground or the ground situation could change but the Surveyor has not been able

with all these discrepancies to identify the boundaries with certainty. Report Y in

paragraphs 10:1, 10:2, and 10:3 indicates only satisfactory superimposition.

[34] In respect of the superimposition of Plan No. 183505, the Plaintiff-Appellant in the

written submissions filed in this Court states that,

[it] would appear that the Surveyor need not have even gone so far as to do a

superimposition of the said Plan No. 183505. It appears that out of a zeal for

accuracy he has done so. The Surveyor has admittedly surveyed the corpus with its

presently existing boundaries.

[35] The Court of Appeal having held that the northern boundary of Preliminary Plan

No. 123 (X), is shown as a land belonging to Don Martin Munasinghe, was of the

view that his ownership has not been proved to a reasonable degree. The Court

observed that a physical identification of the northern boundary was not carried out

by the Surveyor. Although the superimposition of the northern boundary is seen as

the land belonging to Don Martin, the Court was of the view that the Surveyor must

investigate and identify, what is on the ground is the land depicted in Plan No.

183505.

[36] Considering the finality and conclusiveness that attach in terms of Section 48(1) of

the Partition Law, the Surveyor must in his report state whether or not the land

surveyed by him is substantially the same as the land sought to be partitioned as

described in the schedule to the plaint. It was held in Mary Nona vs. Don Justin,1

1 [2016] BLR 130 SC

Page 18 of 22

that the court should insist upon the due compliance with this requirement by the

Surveyor.

[37] The continuity of a partition action was clearly postulated in the case of

Iluppengamu Appuhamylage Martin Appuhamy and others vs. Iluppengamu

Appuhamylage Milrad Chandrawathie and others2, where Justice Mahinda

Samayawardane held on Page 13,

... If the land to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint has not

been properly identified, the Plaintiffs action shall fail. In such a situation the

necessity to investigate title does not arise. Title shall be investigated on a properly

identified parcel of land. The Court shall not first investigate title and then look for

the land to be partitioned. It shall happen vice versa.

[38] Furthermore in a partition suit the court must require evidence in support of the titles

of all parties. There is no doubt that the ground situation could change, since the

Survey done in Plan P1 is over a hundred years. According to the Surveyors report

Y1, the significance of superimposing Plan No. 183505 in preparing Plan No. 468

(Y) was to identify the northern boundary of the corpus devoid of any State land

being attached to it. The Surveyor in his return to court was not certain of the

boundaries to the north and south, and a clear disparity was seen when identifying

the boundaries as stated in the said report marked Y1. As observed by the Court

of Appeal, the duty casted on the trial judge is not only to investigate title but also

to satisfy himself with the identity of the corpus. The Court was of the view that in

this case it seems to have not happened the way it should be done.

[39] Both Presidents Counsel appearing for the contesting Defendant-Respondents

submitted that the boundaries of the corpus have not being identified on a balance

of probability. It is observed that in terms of Section 16(1) of the Partition Law, there

should be a physical survey done on the corpus and a mere superimposition of

2 SC Appeal 172/2015, decided on 21.05.2021

Page 19 of 22

survey plans would not suffice in identifying the corpus. In the absence of cogent

evidence establishing the identity of the corpus sought to be partitioned, the District

Court should have emphasized upon the Plaintiff to adequately identify the corpus.

[40] Section 16(1) of the Partition Law requires that a commission be issued to a

Surveyor directing him to survey the land to which the action relates". It implies

that the land surveyed must conform substantially, with the land, as described in the

plaint (and in respect of which a lis pendense has been registered), as regards the

location, boundaries, and the extent. Sopaya Silva and another vs. Magilin Silva3.

[41] According to the provisions of Section 18(1)(a)(iii) of the Partition Law, the

commissioner has to state inter-alia whether or not the land surveyed by him is, in

his opinion, substantially the same as the land sought to be partitioned as described

in the Plaint.

[42] In the Judgment of the Court of Appeal, Anil Gooneratne J, stated that, based on a

number of facts the corpus was not sufficiently identified, when he observed that;

[the] Learned District judge seems to have not considered the evidence of the

Licensed Surveyor correctly, as the district judge has considered the possession

from the point that arose on Karlinahamys death

[43] When analyzing the identification of the boundaries, the primary concern of the

Court of Appeal was that the boundaries of the land was not sufficiently identified.

The Court of Appeal was mindful that the northern boundary of Preliminary Plan

No. 123 (X) [F], is shown as a land belonging to Don Martin Munasinghe. A

physical identification of the northern boundary was not carried out. The

superimposition of the northern boundary, although seen as the land belonging to

Don Martin Munasinghe, the Surveyor has failed to physically investigate the

ground situation and identify the land as depicted in Plan No. 183505.

[44] When a Surveyor is on notice of any person in possession of land belonging to the

State and made boundaries to the same, it is his bounden duty to physically inspect

such land and the boundaries, to be satisfied that the land is sufficiently and clearly

defined, marked to indicate the land excluding State land and to provide a

memorandum to that effect.

[45] As observed earlier in this Judgment, due to the intervention of parties to this action

or effaced by third parties or by an undisclosed atmospheric change which caused

the destruction of at least the limits of one boundary, there is an uncertainty

surrounding the making of proper boundaries and the limits of lands belonging to

deferent owners.

[46] When old boundaries cannot be conveniently restored and new boundaries are to be

fixed by the Judge, the onus of proof is on the Plaintiff to lead such evidence of its

metes and bounds at the trial, as it will enable the court to determine the same in its

judgment. It is the view of this Court that the evidence led before the trial court, was

totally insufficient to place boundaries differently from that are already in existence.

[47] In Jayasuriya vs. Ubaid4 Sansoni J. held that,

[there] is no question that there was a duty cast on the judge to satisfy himself as

to the identity of the land sought to be partitioned, and for this purpose it was always

open to him to call for further evidence in order to make a proper investigation

[48] In Mary Nona vs. Don Justin5 Eva Wanasundara PC. J. stressed the need and the

duty of court to investigate title and the importance of substantially identifying the

subject matter, when Her Ladyship stated that the onus of a District Judge in a

partition case is greater than any other case, since the Judge has to calculate the

share of entitlement to each party.

[49] The identification of the corpus is the nucleus of a partition case from which it

derives its existence. As such, the Surveyors return is fundamental in identifying

whether the land surveyed is substantially the same land described in the Plaint

which is relied upon by the Plaintiff. Any inconclusiveness in identifying the

boundaries (as is the case here), would negate the required proof of identifying the

corpus on a balance of probability.

[50] In Thiththalapitige Tilakaratne vs. Thiththalapitige Chandrawathi Perera6, this

Court held,

In a partition action if the corpus cannot be identified, ipso facto, the action shall

fail. There is no necessity to investigate title until the corpus is properly identified.

The decision that the corpus has not been properly identified decides the fate of the

action without further ado

[51] Having examined the evidence of all interested parties, the Court of Appeal held

that on the evidence of the Surveyor Silva and Plaintiff, who in my view, could not

place evidence of identity of land and the pedigree in an acceptable manner.

[52] Having considered the oral and written submissions made by the parties before this

Court, we have no hesitation in accepting the above view in the facts and

circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the two questions of law where leave to

appeal was granted by this Court on 31/07/2014,

(1) Has the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the identity of the corpus sought to be

partitioned has not been established.

(2) Has the Court of Appeal erred in not accepting the finding of the trial judge that the

corpus sought to be partitioned and the land claimed by the contesting Defendants

are two different lands.

are both answered in favor of the Defendants-Respondents.

[53] In these reasons, the Judgement dated 13/11/2000 of the District Judge is set aside

and the Judgement dated 30/07/2008 of the Court of Appeal is hereby affirmed and

this Appeal is dismissed with Costs.
