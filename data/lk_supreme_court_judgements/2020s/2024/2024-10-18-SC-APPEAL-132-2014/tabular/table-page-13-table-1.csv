"[17]","The  learned  District  Court  Judge  was  of  the  view  that  the  land  described  in  the"
"","schedule to the Amended Plaint depicted as Lots 1 and 2, in Preliminary Plan No."
"","123  (X)  and  the  buildings  marked  as  A,  B,  C,  D  and  F  belongs  to  the  said"
"","Karlinahamy. Based on the said superimposition the trial court came to the finding"
"","that the land depicted in Preliminary Plan No. 123 and Plan No. 183522 is one and"
"","the same, therefore the corpus to be partitioned has been sufficiently identified. The"
"","trial court was of the view that the title deeds tendered by the Defendants did not"
"","correspond  to  the  Preliminary  Plan  (X),  or  sufficiently  identify  the  corpus  to  the"
"","satisfaction of the evidence placed before court. The learned District Judge having"
"","analyzed  the  evidence  came  to  the  conclusion  that  title  deeds  tendered  by  the"
"","Plaintiffs are not challenged in evidence and therefore the pedigree relied upon by"
"","the Plaintiffs can be accepted."
"[18]","In support  of the findings of the trial court, the Plaintiff-Appellant  in the written"
"","submissions filed in this Court submits that the land surveyed and depicted in the"
"","said Plan No. 123 (X), made by Surveyor Michel J. Silva, is the land sought to be"
"","partitioned and that Lots 1 and 2 of the said Plan constitutes the corpus."
"[19]","It is contended that the evidence given by the Surveyor, relied upon by the trial court"
"","was essentially to show that no State land was included in the corpus. Plan No. 468"
"","(Y)  made  by  the  same  Surveyor,  shows  the  superimposition  of  title  Plan  Nos."
"","183522  and  183505. According  to  the  report  marked  ‘Y1’,  an  accumulation of  8"
"","Lots are marked as Lots 1 to 8 in Plan No. 183522."
"[20]","The  Plaintiffs-Appellants  do  not  dispute 
the  fact 
that  Plan  No.  183505  was"
"","superimposed  to  ascertain  the  accuracy  of  the  northern  boundary  of  the  corpus"
"","which was to ensure that no part of State land is included within the corpus."
