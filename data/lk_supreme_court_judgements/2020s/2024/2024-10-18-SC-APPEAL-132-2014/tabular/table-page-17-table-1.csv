"[33]","On the identity of boundaries, the Court of Appeal stated that;"
"","“…It must be bone [sic] in mind that the Surveyor was cross examined at length,"
"","which creates doubts about identity but one should be mindful of the fact that the"
"","Survey done in Plan P1 is over 100 year [sic] old. There is bound to be changes on"
"","ground or the ground  situation could change but the  Surveyor has  not been able"
"","with all these discrepancies to identify the boundaries with certainty. Report ‘Y’ in"
"","paragraphs 10:1, 10:2, and 10:3 indicates only satisfactory superimposition.”"
"[34]","In respect of the superimposition of Plan No. 183505, the Plaintiff-Appellant in the"
"","written submissions filed in this Court states that,"
"","“[it]  would  appear  that  the  Surveyor  need  not  have  even  gone  so  far  as  to  do  a"
"","superimposition  of  the  said  Plan  No.  183505.  It  appears  that  out  of  a  zeal  for"
"","accuracy he has done so. The Surveyor has admittedly surveyed the corpus with its"
"","presently existing boundaries.”"
"[35]","The Court of Appeal  having held that the northern boundary of Preliminary Plan"
"","No. 123 (X), is shown as a land belonging to Don Martin Munasinghe, was of the"
"","view  that  his  ownership  has  not  been  proved  to  a  reasonable  degree.  The  Court"
"","observed that a physical identification of the northern boundary was not carried out"
"","by the Surveyor. Although the superimposition of the northern boundary is seen as"
"","the land belonging to Don Martin, the Court was of the view that the Surveyor must"
"","investigate  and  identify,  what  is  on  the  ground  is  the  land  depicted  in  Plan  No."
"","183505."
"[36]","Considering the finality and conclusiveness that attach in terms of Section 48(1) of"
"","the Partition Law, the Surveyor “must in his report state whether or not the land"
"","surveyed by him is substantially the same as the land sought to be partitioned as"
"","described in the schedule to the plaint. It was held in Mary Nona vs. Don Justin,1"
