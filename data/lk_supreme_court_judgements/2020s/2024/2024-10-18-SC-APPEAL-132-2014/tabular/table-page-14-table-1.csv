"","depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X) and the land depicted in title Plan No."
"","183522 are one and the same."
"[22]","It 
is  strongly  contended 
that 
the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  when 
it  mistakenly"
"","considered title Plan No. 183505 as the corpus sought to be partitioned, which the"
"","Plaintiff-Appellant submits to be clearly not within the corpus and is not the corpus"
"","sought  to  be  partitioned  in  this  case.  It  is  also  the  contention  of  the  Plaintiff-"
"","Appellant that the Court of Appeal failed to recognize that Deed Nos. 14269 and"
"","14270 are connected to the corpus, which establishes beyond doubt that there are"
"","two 
separate 
lands 
called 
Indigahaowita 
alias 
Puwakgahaowita 
and"
"","Malapawulaowita alias Indigahaowita."
"[23]","In  this  background  it  is  important  to  note  that,  the  learned  District  Judge  has"
"","definitively stated that the corpus described in Plan No. 468 (Y), is the same corpus"
"","described in Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X). It is also the finding of the District Court"
"","that by superimposing Plan No. 183522 (P1) on Plan No. 468 (Y), the corpus to be"
"","partitioned  has  been  identified.  The  court  was  of  the  view  that  even  though  the"
"","village  boundaries  in  Plan  No.  183522  (P1)  were  not  found  and  could  not  be"
"","identified with the superimposition, the boundaries were satisfactorily identified."
"[24]","As  observed  earlier  in  this  Judgment,  the  Plaintiffs  obtained  a  court  commission"
"","therein, Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X) dated 24/09/1987 was prepared by Michel J."
"","Silva, Licensed Surveyor. The same Surveyor, superimposed title Plan No. 183522"
"","and 183505 on the said Preliminary Plan (X) and, Plan No. 468 (Y) was prepared."
"","In Plan No. 468 (Y) the land is described as Indigahaowita alias Puwakgahaowita"
"","bounded on the North by Part of the land claimed by U.A Don Martin Munsainghe"
"","in Plan No. 183505, on the East by Colombo - Horana Road, on the South by part"
"","of the land claimed by J. Athukorala and also Mahakumbura claimed by Alpenis and"
"","others and Mahakumbura Ela, on the West by Mahakumbure Ela and part of the land"
"","claimed  by  U.A.  Don  Martin  Munasinghe  and  A.  Don  Wijeratne  by  Plan  No."
"","183505,  depicted  as  Lots  1  to  8,  in  extent  One  Rood  and Twenty-Seven  Perches"
