"[49]","The  identification  of  the  corpus  is  the  nucleus  of  a  partition  case  from  which  it"
"","derives its existence. As such, the Surveyor’s return is fundamental in identifying"
"","whether  the  land  surveyed  is  substantially  the  same  land  described  in  the  Plaint"
"","which  is  relied  upon  by  the  Plaintiff.    Any  inconclusiveness  in  identifying  the"
"","boundaries (as is the case here), would negate the required proof of identifying the"
"","corpus on a balance of probability."
"[50]","In  Thiththalapitige  Tilakaratne  vs.  Thiththalapitige  Chandrawathi  Perera6,  this"
"","Court held,"
"","“In a partition action if the corpus cannot be identified, ipso facto, the action shall"
"","fail. There is no necessity to investigate title until the corpus is properly identified."
"","The decision that the corpus has not been properly identified decides the fate of the"
"","action without further ado…”"
"[51]","Having examined the  evidence of all interested parties, the Court of Appeal  held"
"","that “…on the evidence of the Surveyor Silva and Plaintiff, who in my view, could not"
"","place evidence of identity of land and the pedigree in an acceptable manner.”"
"[52]","Having considered the oral and written submissions made by the parties before this"
"","Court,  we  have  no  hesitation 
in  accepting 
the  above  view 
in 
the  facts  and"
"","circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the two questions of law where leave to"
"","appeal was granted by this Court on 31/07/2014,"
