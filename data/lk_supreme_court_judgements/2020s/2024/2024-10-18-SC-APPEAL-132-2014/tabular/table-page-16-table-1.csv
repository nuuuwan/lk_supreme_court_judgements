"","stated  that  in  title  Plan  No.  183522,  the  southern  boundary  is  given  as  a  village"
"","boundary as identified by the villagers. It is noted that Preliminary Plan No. 123 (X)"
"","does not show the southern and western boundaries as a village boundary as shown"
"","in the title Plan No. 183522. Having surveyed the land, the southern boundary was"
"","identified  as  a  canal.  Furthermore, 
it 
is  observed 
that 
the  canal  shown  as"
"","“Mahakumbure Ela” is a fixed permanent boundary. However, no such boundary"
"","has been shown in the title Plan No. 183522, and there is no evidence that the said"
"","“Ela” was constructed in recent times, or that the village boundary was replaced by"
"","the “Ela”. This position was admitted during the cross examination of the Surveyor."
"[30]","In  these  circumstances  it  is  the  contention  of  the  Defendants-Respondents  that"
"","Preliminary  Plan  No.  123  (X)  does  not  in  any  way  establish  that  the  said  land"
"","depicted in the title Plan No. 183522 is one and the same land."
"[31]","The  Surveyor  in  his  report,  Y1  states  that,  since  he  was  not  satisfied  with  the"
"","northern  boundary  of  Lot  1  in  Preliminary  Plan  No.  123  (X),  identified  at  the"
"","preliminary survey, with the land described in the schedule to the  Plaint, and the"
"","superimposition of State Plan Co. 283, Surveyor General’s Plan No. 183505 was"
"","used to ascertain the correctness of the northern boundary."
"[32]","At Paragraph 10 of the said report ‘Y1’, the superimposition of Plan No. 183505 on"
"","Plan No. 468 (Y), had shown that the northern boundary tallies only up to 54%, the"
"","eastern boundary does not tally at all, the southern boundary tallies only up to 52%,"
"","while the western boundary tallies only up to 29%. At paragraph 10:4 it is observed"
"","that on an average the boundaries tally only up to 47.3% with the title plans. The"
"","court commissioner clearly states that the boundaries of the land surveyed by him"
"","do not agree with the boundaries described in Plan No. 183505."
