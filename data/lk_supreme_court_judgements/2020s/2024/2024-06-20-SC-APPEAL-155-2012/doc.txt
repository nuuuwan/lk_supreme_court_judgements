Samayawardhena, J.

This is a Trade Mark dispute that arose and was decided by the Registrar

of Patents and Trade Marks of Sri Lanka (the 2nd respondent), and

subsequently on appeal by the District Court of Colombo when the Code

of Intellectual Property Act, No. 52 of 1979 (the Act) was in force.

Therefore, this appeal must be adjudicated in light of the provisions of

that Act. According to section 97 of the Act, “Trade Mark” means any

visible sign serving to distinguish the goods of one enterprise from those

of another.

M.S. Hebtulabhoy & Co. Ltd. (the appellant) is the registered owner of the

Trade Mark RABEA in Roman characters under Trade Mark No. 31953

in Class 30 in respect of Tea since 06.10.1969. The registered Mark was

simply the word RABEA without any get-up or design.

On 30.05.1984, the appellant, in terms of section 102(1) of the Act,

applied to the 2nd respondent for registration of the word RABEA in

Roman characters, and the word RABEA in Arabic script written above

it, to be associated with Trade Mark No. 31953, within a rectangle with a

double line border, under Trade Mark No. 47706 in Class 30 in respect

of Tea.

7

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

Sections 99 and 100 enumerate the grounds for refusal of registration of

a Mark. The 2nd respondent, being of the opinion that the said Mark did

not fall within the purview of sections 99 or 100, published it in the

Gazette prior to its registration, as stipulated in section 107(9) of the Act.

In response to this publication, Stassen Exports Limited (the 1st

respondent) tendered notice of opposition dated 19.06.1985, in terms of

section 107(10) of the Act.

After inquiry, by order dated 28.12.1989, the 2nd respondent overruled

the objections of the 1st respondent and decided to register the Trade

Mark No. 47706 on the basis that the propounded Mark is distinctive.

On appeal by the 1st respondent in terms of section 182 of the Act, the

District Court of Colombo, by judgment dated 22.02.1993, set aside the

order of the 2nd respondent and refused registration of the appellant’s

Mark No. 47706.

Being dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The

Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by judgment dated 04.11.2011.

The appellant came before this Court against the judgment of the Court

of Appeal. This Court granted special leave to appeal on three questions

of law.

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate the fact

that the District Court commenced its order with a manifestly

erroneous conclusion that RABEA is an English word and that the

propounded Trade Mark set out a “purported translation of the said

word in English and in Arabic”?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate that the

transliteration of the word RABEA in the Roman script and/or the

Arabic script was permissible in law and could not in any way

8

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

cause confusion with the English words SPRING BRAND which

was the registered Trade Mark of the 1st respondent?

3. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by making a finding that the

propounded Mark bore relevance to the Mark of the 1st respondent

despite the fact that neither the SPRING BRAND Trade Mark nor a

depiction thereof was before Court or available for inspection by

Court?

The four Trade Marks relevant to this appeal are as follows.

Trade Mark No. 31953 Trade Mark No. 40847

Trade Mark No. 40849 Trade Mark No. 47706

9

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

Let me now consider on what grounds the 1st respondent opposed the

registration of the appellant’s Mark No. 47706. I will consider them as

submitted by the 1st respondent in the notice of opposition dated

19.06.1985 tendered to the 2nd respondent.

1. The propounded mark is identical or similar to or otherwise

deceptively resembles Trade Mark No. 40847 dated 07.12.1979

registered by the opponent.

2. The propounded mark is identical to or similar to or resembles the

said Trade Mark No. 40847 and is sought to be registered in respect

of the same class or description of goods as the said Trade Mark

already in use by the opponent, and is likely to mislead and/or is

calculated to deceive or cause confusion amongst the trade and the

public.

Although the 1st respondent’s main ground of objection before the 2nd

respondent was that the propounded Mark No. 47706 is identical to

Trade Mark No. 40847 registered by the 1st respondent, it is clear that

the 1st respondent did not pursue this purported main ground of

objection, despite mentioning it in paragraph 5(a) and (b) of the plaint

(the appeal) submitted to the District Court.

No submissions were made on behalf of the 1st respondent regarding

Trade Mark No. 40847 before this Court either.

Let me now turn to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the notice of opposition. This

is relevant to the 1st respondent’s Trade Mark No. 40849.

3. The opponent has applied for registration of Trade Mark No. 40849

consisting, inter alia, of the name “Spring Brand” for tea in class 30

and the same was accepted for registration and published in Gazette

No. 204 of 30th July 1972 and the said application is now pending.

10

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

4. The propounded mark has been advertised with the limitation, inter

alia, that “the transliteration of the Arabic words appearing on the

label is Rabea which means spring.” It is presumed that this

representation has been made to the Registrar by the applicant.

Even if the transliteration is assumed to be correct, then this

establishes a surreptitious or devious attempt by the applicant to

indirectly obtain registration of a mark similar to or deceptively

resembling the opponent’s said Trade Mark No. 40849.

According to paragraph 3 quoted above, Trade Mark No. 40849 was

pending registration at the time of filing objections. In other words, when

the 1st respondent opposed registration of the appellant’s propounded

Trade Mark No. 47706, the 1st respondent’s Mark No. 40849 was not

registered in the name of the 1st respondent. Although one does not

necessarily need to be the registered owner to oppose, it is evident from

the judgments of both Courts that they proceeded under the assumption

that the 1st respondent was the registered owner of Trade Mark No. 40849

when the appellant applied for registration of Mark No. 47706.

It is of paramount importance to highlight that the 1st respondent did not

tender Trade Mark No. 40847 or Trade Mark No. 40849 to the District

Court or to the Court of Appeal or to this Court for inspection. Those

Marks or any depiction thereof were not in the brief or in the original case

record. It is at the end of the argument that His Lordship Hon. Chief

Justice as the presiding Judge directed learned President’s Counsel for

the 1st respondent to tender them to Court by way of a motion. To put it

differently, not only did the District Court and the Court of Appeal

proceed on the erroneous basis that the 1st respondent was the registered

owner of Mark No. 40849 when the appellant applied for registration of

Mark No. 47706, but both Courts also concluded that the appellant’s

propounded Mark was misleadingly similar to the 1st respondent’s Mark

11

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

without even examining the 1st respondent’s Marks. This goes to the root

of the judgments of the District Court and the Court of Appeal,

constituting a fundamental error that vitiates both judgments.

In United Biscuits (U.K.) Limited v. Asda Stores Limited [1997] RPC 513,

issues of trademark infringement and passing off arose concerning two

brands producing similar goods using the signs ‘Penguin’ by United

Biscuits, the plaintiff, and Asda’s ‘Puffin’, the defendant. In his judgment,

Robert Walker, J. emphasised at pages 526 and 538 that in cases of

trademark infringement and passing off, the judge must first form his

own provisional view regarding the similarity of the goods or services in

question. To do this, the Marks must be presented before the judge, and

the judge must inspect them.

There is some authority that in a case of this sort a judge should,

before having regard to the evidence of trade witnesses (and apart

from factual evidence of actual confusion) form his own provisional

view: see for instance the approach of Rattee J. in The European v.

The Economist Newspapers [1996] F.S.R. 431, especially at pages

441-2 and 445. [Page 526]

In M.S. Hebtulabhoy & Company Ltd v. Stassen Exports Ltd & Another

[1989] 1 Sri LR 182, Palakidnar J. stated at 188:

The question whether there is confusing similarity is primarily one

for the Judges. Lord Evershed said that the Judge must make up his

mind and not abdicate the decision in that matter to witnesses

before him.

The Court of Appeal did not deal with the history of the case. The Court

of Appeal, in the concluding part of the judgment, expressly states that

the history of the Trade Marks relevant to this case is irrelevant. If the

Court of Appeal looked at the history, especially the registration of Trade

12

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

Mark No. 31953 (RABEA) in the name of the appellant which happened

more than 10 years before this dispute arose, it would have come to a

different conclusion. The Court of Appeal states that the issue is not one

of translation or transliteration of the word RABEA. The Court of Appeal

does not deal with other legal arguments. The judgment of the Court of

Appeal has been predominantly dedicated to discussing the tort of

passing off, which was not, and which cannot be, the main argument of

the 1st respondent. Simply stated, how could a Court rule on passing off

or unfair competition without examining Trade Mark No. 40847 and

Trade Mark No. 40849 of the 1st respondent alongside Trade Mark No.

31953 and Trade Mark No. 47706? It is not possible.

The 1st respondent in the above quoted paragraph 3 states that “the name

‘Spring Brand’ for tea in class 30…was accepted for registration and

published in Gazette No. 204 of 30th July 1972”. This is also incorrect

according to the Gazette tendered by the 1st respondent to this Court with

Mark No. 40849. The relevant Gazette is No. 246 dated 20.05.1983, not

No. 204 of 30.07.1972.

Although the 1st respondent stated in the notice of opposition “The

propounded mark [47706] is identical or similar to or otherwise deceptively

resembles Trade Mark No. 40847 dated 07.12.1979 registered by the

opponent”, as reproduced at the beginning of this judgment, Trade Mark

No. 40847 bears no resemblance whatsoever to the propounded Trade

Mark No. 47706. The two Marks in Roman characters are completely

different. The former is EL MAGHRABI whereas the latter is RABEA.

There is no room whatsoever for any confusion in any respect. This may

be the reason why the 1st respondent did not pursue this objection before

the District Court or the Court of Appeal or this Court.

Trade Mark No. 47706 does not resemble or deceptively resemble Trade

Mark No. 40849 either. The Trade Mark which the 1st respondent sought

13

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

to register was not merely the term “Spring Brand”. As reproduced at the

beginning of this judgment, the Trade Mark No. 40849 is a complex one.

The learned District Judge has not understood the issue. This is evident

by reading the following paragraph of the judgment, which the learned

President’s Counsel for the 1st respondent has quoted in his post-

argument written submission to resist the appeal.

On a perusal of the issues in the case one has to find out whether

the words sought to be registered ‘RABEA’ is similar to plaintiff’s

[the 1st respondent’s] registered name. In this respect, one can say

that the mark sought to be registered is ‘RABEA’ and it is common

ground that this plaintiff is the owner of the registered mark ‘SPRING

BRAND’. Therefore, the registration of ‘SPRING BRAND’ in favour of

the plaintiff will enable him to use the words ‘SPRING BRAND’. Even

in its translated form in Arabic ‘SPRING BRAND’ means ‘RABEA’.

The only conclusion that one can be drawn by this is that the plaintiff

is entitled to use the translation of the words ‘SPRING BRAND’ which

in turn means ‘RABEA’. The word ‘RABEA’ can be used by the

plaintiff only. In the registration No. 40849 one cannot see any

restriction or a limitation as far as the words ‘SPRING BRAND’ is

concerned. If there is no limitation the word ‘SPRING’ can be used in

a translated or transliterated form. When the ‘SPRING BRAND’ trade

mark No. 40849 was advertised in the government gazette by the

plaintiff, the defendant did not object to it and the trade mark

‘SPRING BRAND’ in registration No. 40849 was registered on 7th

December 1979 long before the present application was made by the

defendant.

If I take only this paragraph, there are several inaccuracies.

14

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

The learned District Judge states the Mark sought to be registered under

Trade Mark No. 47706 by the appellant is RABEA and the 1st respondent

is the owner of the Mark SPRING BRAND and SPRING BRAND in Arabic

is RABEA.

I must reiterate that the District Judge has come to these findings of fact

without examining the two Marks. In my view, without looking at the two

Marks, it is impossible to come to accurate findings.

As previously mentioned, the appellant has been the owner of the Trade

Mark RABEA since 06.10.1969 under Trade Mark No. 31953. The 1st

respondent applied for the registration of his SPRING BRAND Mark No.

40849 on 07.12.1979 and it was gazetted on 20.05.1983. The appellant

did not attempt to register the Mark RABEA for the first time on

30.05.1984 under Trade Mark No. 47706, as the District Judge states.

What the appellant sought to do, 15 years after the registration of Trade

Mark No. 31953, was to add the transliteration of the word RABEA in

Arabic script above the already registered Mark RABEA, not the

translation of the word RABEA.

Contrary to what the District Judge states, by the time the appellant

made his application to register Trade Mark No. 47706, the 1st

respondent’s application to register Trade Mark No. 40849 (SPRING

BRAND) was pending.

It is misleading to characterise the 1st respondent’s Mark solely as

SPRING BRAND. The English words SPRING BRAND found in the 1st

respondent’s Mark are not the only words present in the Mark.

The District Judge states there are no restrictions to the Mark SPRING

BRAND and therefore the 1st respondent can use it in translated or

transliterated form. He further states since “in Arabic SPRING BRAND

means RABEA”, “The word RABEA can be used by the plaintiff [the 1st

15

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

respondent] only”. This analysis is completely erroneous. RABEA is the

registered Trade Mark of the appellant since 1969. The word RABEA can

be used only by the appellant, not by the 1st respondent. The Arabic

translation of the English term SPRING BRAND is not RABEA, although

the Arabic translation of the English term SPRING (without BRAND) may

be RABEA.

Had the learned District Judge looked at the Trade Mark No. 31953

tendered by the 1st respondent to the District Court, he would have

realised that it was the first registered Trade Mark where the word RABEA

is found.

It is also significant to note that the 2nd respondent in accepting Trade

Mark No. 47706 for publication states “This mark is associated with mark

No. 31953”. Mark No. 31953 has been renewed for consecutive periods of

10 years as required by section 115 of the Act.

According to the Gazette, the appellant’s propounded Mark No. 47706

has been accepted “subjected to the condition that the mark will only be

used as depicted in the application and that its translation in any language

will not be used.” It also states “The transliteration of the Arabic words

appearing on the label is ‘Rabea’ which means spring.” What is prevented

is the translation of the word RABEA, not transliteration. This was in line

with section 100(1)(d) of Act No. 52 of 1979 (although the provisions of

the new Act No. 36 of 2003 are different).

The appellant did not make an attempt to translate the word RABEA. The

District Judge was wrong when he stated at page 9 of the judgment that

“T.M. 31953 sets a limitation in that it can be used only as depicted in the

application and no translation or transliteration can be utilised.”

The District Judge says when the ‘SPRING BRAND’ Trade Mark No.

40849 was advertised in the government Gazette by the 1st respondent,

16

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

the appellant did not object to it. First, the 2nd respondent accepted the

Mark and decided to send it for publication. It appears that the appellant

did not object to it, perhaps because they believed that both Marks could

coexist—and rightly so. Merely because the appellant did not object to

the 1st respondent’s Mark No. 40849 does not mean that the appellant’s

Mark should be rejected. The District Judge has acknowledged this when

he states, “Anyway, the 1st respondent (now appellant) had not opposed

the appellant’s (now 1st respondent) said application No. 40849 as it did

not consider the appellant’s mark to resemble the 1st respondent’s

registration mark No. 31953 RABEA.”

Learned President’s Counsel for the 1st respondent argues that “if the

propounded mark 47706 sought to be registered by the appellant is

permitted to be registered it would in fact be permitting the appellant to

register the translation of the respondent’s registered trademark ‘Spring’

which will be a direct violation of the prohibition contained in section

100(1)(d) of the earlier Code and 104(1)(d) of the Intellectual Property Act

No. 36 of 2003.” If this argument is valid, the first violation was committed

by the 1st respondent when the 1st respondent applied to register the

English translation of the appellant’s registered Trade Mark RABEA,

which is SPRING.

In any event, section 100(1)(d), as it stood, did not place a blanket

prohibition even on translations of registered Marks. It only prohibited

the registration of Marks that were translations of already registered

Marks, provided such translations were “likely to mislead the public”.

Section 100(1)(d) read as follows:

A mark shall not be registered which constitutes a reproduction in

whole or in part, an imitation, translation or transcription, likely to

mislead the public, of a mark or trade name which is well known

in Sri Lanka and belongs to a third party.

17

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

The 1st respondent in paragraphs 5-12 of his grounds of opposition

mainly deals with unfair trade practices. It is the policy of the law to

permit and encourage fair competition in trade while discouraging and

preventing unfair competition. Fair competition benefits consumers by

promoting innovation, improving product quality, and keeping prices

competitive. Unfair competition, on the other hand, misleads consumers

and undermines these principles. On the facts and circumstances of this

case, the appellant did not engage in unfair trade practices. The appellant

was not attempting to piggyback on the 1st respondent’s Mark; vice versa,

however, might be possible.

The District Judge at page 8 of the judgment states the 1st respondent

“has been using the unregistered mark SHAI EL RABEA in Arabic and its

translation therein SPRING TIME TEA.” If that is correct, it appears to me

that it might be a violation of the appellant’s registered Trade Mark

RABEA for Tea. Section 142(1) of Act No. 52 of 1979 enacted “Any act of

competition contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters

shall constitute an act of unfair competition.”

There is no universally applicable formula for evaluating the similarity of

marks. Facts differ from case to case, so does the weight to be attached

to such facts.

In L. Bently and B. Sherman, Intellectual Property Law (3rd edn, 2009)

page 761 state:

It is important to note that the approach adopted by the courts in

deciding whether the signs are similar always depends on the facts

in hand. As such, the points below should be treated as providing

no more than general guidance. In deciding whether two signs are

similar enough to cause confusion, the marks are rarely looked at

side-by-side. Instead, the courts tend to ask the hypothetical

18

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

question: if a person saw the signs separately, would they mistake

the defendant’s product for that of the claimant’s? When deciding

whether signs are similar, the courts also tend to look at the signs

as a whole and in the context in which they are used.

It is in that context Laddie J. in Wagamama Ltd v. City Centre Restaurants

PLC [1995] FSR 713 at 732 remarked, “Whether there has been trade

mark infringement is more a matter of feel than science.”

Nevertheless, in order to assess similarity of the Marks, the tests of visual

similarity and phonetic similarity are widely recognised and commonly

employed across the board.

In Sabel v. Puma [1997] ECR 1-6191, the European Court of Justice was

called upon to apply Article 4(1)(b) of the First Council Directive

89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 in adjudicating a dispute related to

the registration of Trade Marks. Article 4(1)(b) provided that “A trade mark

shall not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared

invalid: (b) if because of its identity with, or similarity to, the earlier trade

mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the

trade marks, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,

which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark”.

In doing so, the Court in considering how Trade Marks should be

evaluated noted as follows:

22. As pointed out in paragraph 18 of this judgment, Article 4(1)(b)

of the Directive does not apply where there is no likelihood of

confusion on the part of the public. In that respect, it is clear from the

tenth recital in the preamble to the Directive that the appreciation of

the likelihood of confusion ‘depends on numerous elements and, in

particular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, of the

association which can be made with the used or registered sign, of

19

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

the degree of similarity between the trade mark and the sign and

between the goods or services identified’. The likelihood of confusion

must therefore be appreciated globally, taking into account all

factors relevant to the circumstances of the case.

23. That global appreciation of the visual, aural or conceptual

similarity of the marks in question must be based on the overall

impression given by the marks, bearing in mind, in particular, their

distinctive and dominant components. The wording of Article 4(1)(b)

of the Directive – ‘…there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part

of the public…’ – shows that the perception of marks in the mind of

the average consumer of the type of goods or services in question

plays a decisive role in the global appreciation of the likelihood of

confusion. The average consumer normally perceives a mark as a

whole and does not proceed to analyse its various details.

It is undisputed that there is no visual similarity between the two Marks;

there is no likelihood of misleading the public in that respect when Trade

Mark No. 47706 of the appellant is presented or compared with Trade

Mark No. 40849 of the 1st respondent.

There is no phonetic/aural similarity between the two Marks: one is

RABEA and the other is SPRING BRAND. There is no likelihood of

confusion among consumers in that respect either.

The argument of the 1st respondent seems to be that when the Arabic

script of RABEA is translated into English in the mind of a consumer,

there might be confusion regarding the source of the goods because

“RABEA” means “spring”. However, for this argument to succeed, the

consumer would need to know both Arabic and English. There is no

evidence that the targeted group is conversant in both Arabic and

20

SC/APPEAL/155/2012

English. Typically, consumers perceive a mark as a whole rather than

analysing its individual components.

Although the District Judge starts the judgment by stating that RABEA

is an English word, it is not an English word. Then he says “RABEA is an

Arabic word”, which is also not correct. When transliterated into Arabic,

“RABEA” is said to mean “spring”.

The 1st respondent in paragraph 5 of his grounds of opposition states

“The English word for the Muslim spring is Rabia and not Rabea.” This

raises the question whether the 1st respondent is not fully prepared to

accept that “RABEA” means “spring” in the Arabic script.

I cannot resist re-emphasising that Mark No. 47706 is not the verbatim

English translation of Mark No. 40849. The Mark No. 40849 does not

solely constitute the English word SPRING or SPRING BRAND. It

constitutes at least of 20 English words and a large picture of a flower.

Mark No. 47706 has only two words, neither of which are English words;

one is in Roman characters and the other is in Arabic characters.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the 2nd respondent was

correct when he concluded that the two Marks – No. 40849 of the 1st

respondent and No. 47706 of the appellant – are distinctive.

I answer the three questions of law in the affirmative.

The judgments of the District Court and the Court of Appeal are set aside

and the order of the 2nd respondent dated 28.12.1989 is restored.

Although the 2nd respondent has not given adequate reasons for his

decision, I agree with his conclusion.

The present appellants are entitled to recover all incurred costs in all four

Tribunals/Courts (Intellectual Property Office, District Court, Court of

Appeal and the Supreme Court) from the 1st respondent.
