"10.","The  Petitioner  submits 
that, 
for 
reasons  unknown 
to  her,  a  second  Preliminary"
"","Investigation was conducted by the 25th Respondent, and she was requested to appear"
"","on  2nd  September  2019  by  letter  dated  20th  August  2019.4  The  Petitioner  argues  the"
"","second  Preliminary 
Investigation 
itself 
to  be 
indicative  of 
the 
fact 
that  she  was"
"","prematurely  placed  under  interdiction  with  inadequate  evidence.  The  Petitioner  had"
"","refused to appear before the 25th Respondent having received legal advice to not do so"
"","whilst her letter of interdiction was in place."
"11.","Subsequently, the Petitioner received a letter dated 11th February 20205 stating that the"
"","Governing Council of the 1st Respondent University had taken the decision to suspend"
"","her  entire  pay  on  the  basis  of  her  failure  to  support  the  ongoing  investigations"
"","pertaining to examination irregularities in the Faculty of Medicine."
"12.","The Petitioner attempts to establish that the 1st Respondent University was remiss in its"
"","duty for its failure to promptly file a police complaint to commence an investigation into"
"","the offence  committed by the 28th  Respondent soon after it was discovered. As such,"
"","she claims to have been forced to assume responsibility and take action independently"
"","by  filing  the  complaint  herself  to  the  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Criminal  Investigation"
"","Division, Galle.6"
"13.","The Petitioner also alleges that neither the University nor the Vice Chancellor took steps"
"","to 
commence 
investigations  against 
the  other  academic 
staff  who  had  direct"
"","involvement  in  permitting  the  28th  Respondent  to  sit  Part  1  of  the  third-year  MBBS"
"","Examination without first successfully passing the second-year Examination."
