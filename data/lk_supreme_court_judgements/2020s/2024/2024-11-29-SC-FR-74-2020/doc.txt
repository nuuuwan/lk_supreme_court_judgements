THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioner, namely Mrs. V. Hiroshini Piyadasa (hereinafter the Petitioner), filed this

fundamental rights application by Petition dated 12th March 2020 under Article 126(1)

read with Article 17 of the Constitution seeking, inter alia, a declaration that her

fundamental right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law guaranteed

under Article 12(1), and the fundamental right to freedom to engage in a lawful

profession guaranteed under Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated due

to the actions and/or omissions by one or more of the Respondents.

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 14

2. On 27th July 2020, this Court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Facts According to the Petitioner

3. The Petitioner was employed as the Senior Assistant Registrar to the Faculty of Medicine

of Ruhuna University, the 1st Respondent (hereinafter the 1st Respondent University),

during which she worked with several subordinate non-academic members in

conducting the duties assigned to her role, primarily involving administrative and

examinations-related work. The Petitioner was placed under interdiction effective from

11th December 2018, which, inter alia, forms the basis of the Petitioners instant

application, and was subsequently terminated.

4. Petitioner submits that, as part and parcel of the Petitioner's role as the Senior Assistant

Registrar, she was responsible for all documents in the Dean's Office while all the other

documents were handled by her subordinate officers and the staff attached to the

Dean's Office.

5. The 28th Respondent, Ms. A. W. Nirasha (hereinafter the 28th Respondent), was a

student admitted to the Medical Faculty of the 1st Respondent University, having been

seconded by the Sri Lanka Navy for the academic year 2011/12 as per selections made

by the University Grants Commission in terms of the Special Provisions for Enlisted

Armed Forces.

6. The Petitioner submits that a routine inspection revealed that the 28th Respondent,

despite failing her second-year MBBS examination had advanced to the third-year of

the MBBS programme and was permitted to sit for Part I of the third-year MBBS

Examination. The Petitioner states that further investigations revealed that the 28th

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 14

Respondent had submitted forged documents1 to the Sri Lanka Navy to establish that

she had passed the second-year MBBS Examination.

7. Importantly, the Petitioner claims to have promptly informed the aforementioned

irregularities to the Dean of the Medical Faculty and the Vice Chancellor of the 1st

Respondent University on 26th June 2018.

8. According to the Petitioner, a series of inspections had followed, conducted by a

Preliminary Investigation Committee tasked with investigating the alleged fraudulent

activities committed by the 28th Respondent. The Report of the Committees findings2

indicate that the Committee concluded that the 28th Respondent had, in fact, forged

documents in order to advance to the next stage of her MBBS Examination. The Report

further indicates that the Committee has discovered ample evidence of the Petitioners

involvement in the aforementioned fraudulent activities.

9. Upon the said findings of the Preliminary Investigations Committee, the Council of the

1st Respondent University had made the decision to temporarily suspend the

studentship of the 28th Respondent as well as place the Petitioner under interdiction

with half-pay according to the provisions in paragraph 18(1) of Chapter XXII read with

paragraph 8(4) of Chapter VI of the Establishment Code effective from 11th December

2018. The said decision had been communicated to the Petitioner by letter dated 11th

December 2018.3

3 Marked P9 appended to the Petition of the Petitioner dated 12th March 2020

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 14

10. The Petitioner submits that, for reasons unknown to her, a second Preliminary

Investigation was conducted by the 25th Respondent, and she was requested to appear

on 2nd September 2019 by letter dated 20th August 2019.4 The Petitioner argues the

second Preliminary Investigation itself to be indicative of the fact that she was

prematurely placed under interdiction with inadequate evidence. The Petitioner had

refused to appear before the 25th Respondent having received legal advice to not do so

whilst her letter of interdiction was in place.

11. Subsequently, the Petitioner received a letter dated 11th February 20205 stating that the

Governing Council of the 1st Respondent University had taken the decision to suspend

her entire pay on the basis of her failure to support the ongoing investigations

pertaining to examination irregularities in the Faculty of Medicine.

12. The Petitioner attempts to establish that the 1st Respondent University was remiss in its

duty for its failure to promptly file a police complaint to commence an investigation into

the offence committed by the 28th Respondent soon after it was discovered. As such,

she claims to have been forced to assume responsibility and take action independently

by filing the complaint herself to the Officer-in-Charge of the Criminal Investigation

Division, Galle.6

13. The Petitioner also alleges that neither the University nor the Vice Chancellor took steps

to commence investigations against the other academic staff who had direct

involvement in permitting the 28th Respondent to sit Part 1 of the third-year MBBS

Examination without first successfully passing the second-year Examination.

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 14

14. Furthermore, the Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent University, despite having

claimed to possess adequate evidence to frame charges, failed to issue a charge sheet

against her.

Facts According to the Respondents

15. The learned Deputy Solicitor General contends that the Petitioners claim of

responsibility only over the documents in the Deans Office while allowing subordinates

to handle other documents was an attempt to evade accountability for the forgery of

the result sheet concerning the 28th Respondent, particularly as the copy of the forged

result sheet in question was under the direct control and custody of the Petitioner and

the academic staff attached to the Petitioners office, but under the Petitioners direct

supervision.

16. Moreover, upon perusal of the Magistrates Court case record7 and Document marked

R15,8 it is clear that the fraudulent act was, in fact, discovered in or around November

2017 and brought to the notice of the Petitioner, although no immediate action was

taken by her. The Preliminary Inquiry Report9 clearly denotes that an inquiry has been

carried out regarding several other officers besides the Petitioner, refuting any claims

to the contrary by the Petitioner.

17. Furthermore, the 1st to 27th, 29th and 30th Respondents submit that 1st Respondent

University did, in fact, file a police complaint to the Special Investigation Unit of Matara

on 8th January 2019. They had also issued a letter dated 25th February 2019 to the

Officer-in-Charge of the Criminal Investigation Division, Galle, following a request for

further information as a result of the Petitioners complaint.

ANALYSIS

Alleged Improprieties in Conducting Inquiries

18. Chapter XIX, Paragraph 16.2 of the University Establishment Code states as follows,

If a criminal offence or an offence of bribery or corruption is disclosed during the

course of or at the end of a disciplinary proceeding, the tribunal/inquiry officer

shall report the matter to the Chairman of the Commission or Principal

Executive Officer of the Higher Educational Institution/Institute as the case

may be, together with copies of records of proceedings so that he may refer the

matter to Decisions of the Police or the Commission to Investigate Allegations

of Bribery or Corruption or such other statutory authority for suitable action

under the appropriate law. [Emphasis added.]

19. As the Establishment Code itself provides, the complaint to the relevant authority can

be filed during the inquiry or at the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings by the

chairman or the principal executive officer of the higher educational institution. As a

result, any delay by the 1st Respondent University in informing the relevant authorities

as per the Code can be justified. In fact, a perusal of the complaint made by the

Petitioner to the police,10 reveals that the Petitioner herself filed the above-mentioned

police complaint only after being suspended from her services.

20. As mentioned above, another allegation by the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent

University failed to issue a charge sheet against her.

10 Marked R11 appended to the Affidavit of the 2nd Respondent dated 22nd April 2021

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 14

21. Chapter XIX, Paragraphs 8.2 and 8.3 of the University Establishment Code provide

for preliminary inquiries and issuance of a charge sheet as follows,

[8.2] Preliminary Investigation

A preliminary investigation is one that is conducted by a person or persons

authorized to conduct preliminary investigations in subparagraph 6.1.1 of this

Chapter to find facts as are necessary to ascertain the truth of a suspicion or

information that an act of misconduct has been committed by an employee or several

employees and to find out and report whether there is a prima facie case, sufficient

material and evidence to prefer charges and take disciplinary action against the

person or persons under suspicion.

[]

[8.3] If the preliminary investigation discloses a prima facie case against the

suspected person, the Disciplinary Authority shall issue a Charge Sheet against him

and call upon him to show cause as to why he should not be punished. Approval of

the appropriate Disciplinary Authority shall be obtained for the charge sheet and the

Disciplinary Authority shall authorize a specific natural person holding the Office

such as Chairman of the Commission, or the Principal Executive Officer of the Higher

Educational Institution/Institute to personally sign and issue the Charge Sheet.

22. In the Affidavit of the 2nd Respondent dated 23rd April 2021, the 2nd Respondent explains

that the delay in the issuance of a charge sheet was a direct result of the Petitioners

refusal to participate in the investigations. Furthermore, quite telling of the Petitioners

dishonest deportment, it is observable on record that a comprehensive letter detailing

the charges against the Petitioner was issued to the Petitioner by registered post on

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 14

22nd May 2020,11 which the Petitioner has duly acknowledged by letter dated 8th June

2020, in requesting the documents referred to in the charge sheet.12

Was the Petitioner entitled to her monthly emoluments during the Inquiry?

23. Upon perusing the letter of interdiction dated 11th December 2018 issued by the Vice

Chancellor13 and the decision of the Council taken at its 386th meeting,14 this court

further observes that the 1st Respondent University has suspended the Petitioner with

half-pay in the first instance effective from 11th December 2018 pending the said

preliminary inquiry.

24. The Petitioner states that, thereafter, she received the decision from the Governing

Council to suspend her half-salary due to her failure to support ongoing preliminary

inquiries, by a letter dated 11th February 2020.15

25. Chapter VI, Paragraph 8.3 of the University Establishment Code stipulates as follows,

A person against whom there is a prima facie case of negligence, misappropriation,

fraud, forgery or similar misdemeanor committed in respect of public property and

causing or resulting in a loss to the Government or to the Commission/Higher

Educational Institution/Institute or any other Statutory Board or Corporation, or

against whom there is a prima facie case of bribery or any other means of illegal

gain, shall not receive any emoluments from the date of his interdiction.

15 Marked P20 appended to the Petition of the Petitioner dated 12th March 2020

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 14

26. Upon perusal of the letter dated 19th August 2022 (Disciplinary Order),16 it is clear that

the Petitioner was charged with an offence constituting a prima facie case of forgery

capable of causing or resulting in a loss to the 1st Respondent University. Therefore,

strictly according to the University Establishment Code, the Petitioner is ineligible to

receive any emoluments from the date of her interdiction.

Is there a violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights?

27. The all-familiar non-discriminatory clause of our Constitution codified in Article 12 reads

that, All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of

the law.

28. In the case of Dissanayake v. Piyal De Silva17 Bandaranayake C.J. held that,

The right to equality means that among equals, the law should be equal and should

be equally administered and thereby the like should be treated alike. Provisions in

Article 12(1) would only provide for the equal protection of the law and shall not

provide for the equal violation of the law.18

29. Article 12(1) jurisprudence has now evolved well beyond the tenets of comparative

equality. This court has time and time again recognised Article 12(1) as a provision that

encapsulates the rule of law itself. Any illegal, arbitrary, capricious or mala fide treatment

against a person is a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

30. As discussed hereinabove, it is clear that the Respondents have followed the proper

procedure laid out in the University Establishment Code in the suspension of the

16 Marked R16 appended to the Written Submissions of the Respondents dated 30th April 2024.

17 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 134

18 ibid, at 140-141

SC FR No. 74/2020 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 14

Petitioner's service with half-pay during the preliminary inquiry. Upon finding a prima

facie case against the Petitioner for forgery, abetting or altering the documents in the

said inquiry, her half-pay was terminated in accordance with Chapter VI, Paragraph 8.3

of the University Establishment Code. Suspension of the pay, to which she had no

entitlement to begin with, cannot be considered a violation of fundamental rights.

31. I am of the view that facts adverted to above do not disclose that the Petitioner has

been treated in a discriminatory manner nor does it disclose that there has been any

arbitrary, capricious or mala fide treatment of the Petitioner. The Respondents have

acted in accordance with the University Establishment Code in suspending the pay,

filing of the police complaint as well as in issuing the charge sheet and holding the

inquiries against the Petitioner.

32. Therefore, in considering the totality of the aforementioned circumstances, I find that

the Petitioner has failed to establish a violation of the fundamental right guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution by the Respondents.

33. Accordingly, the Petitioners application is dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
