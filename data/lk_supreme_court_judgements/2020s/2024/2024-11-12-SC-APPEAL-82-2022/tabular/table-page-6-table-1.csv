"Section 16 of the PTA reads:"
"“16 (1)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  any  other  law,  where  any  person  is  charged"
"with any offence under this Act, any statement made by such person at any time,"
"whether –"
"(a)  It amounts to a confession or not;"
"(b) Made orally or reduced to writing;"
"(c)  Such person was or was not in custody or presence of a police officer;"
"(d) Made in the course of an investigation or not;"
"(e)  It was or was not wholly or partly in answer to any question,"
"may  be  proved  as  against  such  person  if  such  statement  is  not  irrelevant    under"
"section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance;"
"Provided however, that no such statement shall be proved as against such person"
"if  such  statement  was  made  to  a  police  officer  below  the  rank  of  an  Assistant"
"Superintendent."
"(2)  The  burden  of  proving  that  any  statement  referred  to  in  sub  section  (1)  is"
"irrelevant  under  section  24  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  shall  be  on  the  person"
"asserting it to be irrelevant.”"
