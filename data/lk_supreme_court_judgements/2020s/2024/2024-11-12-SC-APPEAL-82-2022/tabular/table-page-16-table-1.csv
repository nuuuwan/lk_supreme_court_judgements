"The Learned Justices however, having held as mentioned above observed that “…what has to be"
"decided here is whether the learned High Court Judge errored (sic) in deciding that the above"
"mentioned confession  was made voluntarily or  not”  (at  page 6).  In this process,  thereafter, the"
"Learned Justices had not proceeded to consider the Respondent’s assertion that he was subjected"

"Respondent  twice,  but  observed  “The  fact  that  whether  the  ASP  to  whom  the  confession  was"
"made to was able to translate the same this court has to consider very seriously” (at page 6)."
"In  my  view,  by  adopting  the  approach  as  reflected  in  the  above  portions  of  the  Judgment,  the"
"Learned  Justices  had  failed  to  apprehend  the  distinction  between  these  two  issues,  namely"
"voluntariness  in  the  context  of  Section  24  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  and  the  issue  on  the"
"competency  of  the  ASP  to  translate  the  statement,  which  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  issue  on"

"confession  based  on  voluntariness  and  challenges  on  other  grounds  has  a  clear  impact  on  the"

"the  former  instance  a  confession  can  be  declared  irrelevant  if  it  “appears  to  court”  that  the"
"confession is made due to threat, promise or inducement."
"In fact, having examined the evidence of the SP in this regard, the Learned Justices had to come"
"to  a  finding  that  there  is  a  “reasonable  doubt”  on  the  competency  of  the  SP  to  translate  the"
"statement from Tamil to Sinhala. Presence of a mere doubt is insufficient to declare a confession"
