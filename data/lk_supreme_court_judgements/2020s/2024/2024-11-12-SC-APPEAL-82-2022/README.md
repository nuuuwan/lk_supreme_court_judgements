Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC.CJ.

The Attorney-General invoked the jurisdiction of this Court and impugned the Order of the Court

of Appeal dated 02.12.2021. The Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

Accused-Respondent or the Respondent) stands indicted with two others in the High Court of

Colombo and the trial is in progress. Two hundred and thirty counts in the indictment are framed

under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended and

Emergency Regulations promulgated under the Public Security Ordinance. Offences in the

indictment include the conspiracy to commit the murder of a specified person the army

commander, aiding and abetting to commit attempted murder of the army commander and series

of offences of murder, attempted murder, causing injury by a bomb attack that were committed

in the course of the same transaction of the offence of conspiracy and abetment to commit

attempted murder of the army commander.

One of the main items of evidence against the 1st Accused-Respondent is a purported statement

he has made to a Superintendent of Police (SP) in the course of investigation. The 1st Accused-

Respondent was in custody at the time the purported statement was recorded. When the

prosecution moved to produce the aforesaid statement through the relevant Superintendent of

Police, an objection was raised on the basis that 1st Accused-Respondent did not make a

statement to the witness. The Learned High Court Judge thereafter had proceeded to hold an

inquiry to examine whether the purported statement had been made voluntarily. At the inquiry,

the evidence of the relevant Superintendent of Police, several police officers who brought the 1st

Accused-Respondent to the SP from the place of detention and took him back, the typist who

prepared the statement of the Respondent and the doctor who examined the 1st Accused-

Respondent had been presented by the prosecution. All these witnesses had been cross-examined

by the Learned Counsel who represented the 1st Accused-Respondent. Thereafter, the 1st

4

Accused-Respondent had made a statement from the dock and called a witness on his behalf.

Thereafter the Learned High Court Judge by his Order dated 25th August 2017, has allowed the

prosecution to produce the impugned statement as evidence. The Learned High Court Judge has

held that the prosecution has proved beyond doubt that the 1st Accused-Respondent had made the

impugned statement to the relevant SP. Furthermore, he had held that the impugned statement

has been made voluntarily and the 1st Accused-Respondent has failed to show that the aforesaid

statement was made involuntarily or that it was obtained by the SP by a threat, promise or

inducement.

Being aggrieved by this Order, the 1st Accused-Respondent invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the Court of Appeal and the Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal by their Judgment dated

02.12.2021, set aside the aforementioned Order of the High Court. The Learned Justices of the

Court of Appeal held that the confession recorded in the instant case is in contravention of the

provisions of section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance. It was further held that the ASP

translating the entirety of the confession on six long days causes doubt as with regard to the

voluntariness of the same.

The Attorney-General impugns the Judgment of the Court of Appeal and move that the Order of

the High Court be restored. This Court has granted leave to appeal on the following questions of

law:

1) Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law in deciding that the adduced statement of the

Accused which was sought to be produced by the prosecution under Section 16 of the P.T.A. is

irrelevant in terms of Section 16(2) of P.T.A?

2) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in Law by failing to properly consider the evidence

adduced in the course of the voir dire inquiry?

3) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in Law and fact by misdirecting itself on the valuation

of evidence adduced in the voir dire inquiry?

The main issue in this matter revolves round the manner in which the relevant statement was

recorded. It is common ground that the document the prosecution moved to produce at the trial is

typewritten in Sinhala. According to the evidence of the prosecution, the 1st Accused-Respondent

5

made the statement in the Tamil Language to the SP and it was the SP who translated the said

statement into Sinhala. Furthermore, it is contended that certain parts of the statement were made

by the 1st Accused-Respondent in Sinhala.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General impugns the findings of the Court of Appeal on the basis

that the Learned Justices did not consider the evidence of all relevant witness and thereby erred

in arriving at the finding that the recording of the relevant statement is in contravention of

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General further contended

the Court of Appeal erred by failing to properly analyse the dock statement of the 1st Accused-

Respondent and other evidence presented at the voir dire inquiry. It was her contention when all

evidence presented at the inquiry was properly analysed and considered there is no reason or a

valid legal basis to set aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge. It is her contention that

the relevant provisions of the PTA as well as the Evidence Ordinance has been fully complied

with and the exclusion of one of the most important items of evidence caused grave prejudice to

the prosecution

The Learned Counsel for the 1st Accused-Respondent challenged the contention of the learned

Deputy Solicitor-General. He contended that the Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal had

based their decision on relevant legal principles. He contended that the Learned Trial Judge had

failed to appreciate these relevant legal principles. He further contended that the legal principles

governing a trial cannot be directly applied to a voir dire inquiry. It is his contention that the

difference between the burden and standard of proof in a criminal trial and a voir dire inquiry has

been correctly recognised and adopted by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the Learned Justices

of the Court of Appeal has proceeded to examine the issue whether the statement in question has

been made voluntarily, ignoring the fact that the Counsel appearing for the 1st Accused-

Respondent had taken contrary defences. It is his contention that the Learned Justices of the

Court of Appeal has acted with utmost fairness to the 1st Accused-Respondent. He further

contended that at an voir dire inquiry, proof of facts as enumerated in Section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance does not arise and the court must reject the confession if it appears to the Court that

the statement is not voluntary.

6

As the indictment on which the 1st Accused-Respondent is tried in the High Court contains

offences under the PTA and Emergency Regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance

one of the statutes governing the trial is the PTA.

Section 16 of the PTA reads:

16 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, where any person is charged

with any offence under this Act, any statement made by such person at any time,

whether

(a) It amounts to a confession or not;

(b) Made orally or reduced to writing;

(c) Such person was or was not in custody or presence of a police officer;

(d) Made in the course of an investigation or not;

(e) It was or was not wholly or partly in answer to any question,

may be proved as against such person if such statement is not irrelevant under

section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance;

Provided however, that no such statement shall be proved as against such person

if such statement was made to a police officer below the rank of an Assistant

Superintendent.

(2) The burden of proving that any statement referred to in sub section (1) is

irrelevant under section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance shall be on the person

asserting it to be irrelevant.

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:

A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if

the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any

inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused

person, proceeding from a person in authority, or proceeding from another

person..and which inducement, threat or promise is sufficient in the

opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to

7

him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or

avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

(emphasis added)

It is trite law that in a criminal trial the burden of proving the guilt of the accused remains right

throughout with the prosecution and such proof should be beyond reasonable doubt. It is

sufficient for an accused to raise a reasonable doubt on the evidence of the prosecution to

secure an acquittal. Therefore, the burden on the prosecution to secure a conviction of an accused

is to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt. According to Section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance proved is defined as A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the

matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a

prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition

that it exists. However, a court could reject a confession as irrelevant, if it appears to the court

that the statement is made due to threat, promise or inducement as stipulated under Section 24 of

the Evidence Ordinance (Emphasis added). The Learned Counsel for the Respondent drew our

attention to the Judgment of the two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Vivekanandan v

Selvaratnam 79(1) NLR 337, on the manner in which a Court should make an assessment in

deciding the irrelevancy of a confession of an accused person as provided under Section 24 of

the Evidence Ordinance. It is pertinent to observe, that the issue before the court in the said case

was whether the accused had made the impugned confession due to threat, promise or

inducement. In the said matter the Learned Justices of the Supreme Court had observed that the

main witness who had recorded the impugned statement had been evasive when he was

questioned in relation to matters that had a bearing on the voluntaries of the confession. The

Court observed that Going through his evidence I come to the inescapable conclusion that, to

say the least, this witness has been most evasive in the manner he had given his evidence (at

page 340). Justice Malcolm Perera further observed that It is most unfortunate that this witness

has displayed an aversion to answer simple questions in a straightforward manner. He has

sought too often to seek refuge in his often repeated formula, it is possible, but I cannot

recollect. I cannot over look his performance, as these questions and answers are most relevant

to the vital issue of voluntariness of the statement of the first accused produced as P21. (at page

342). Having considered the evidence of this witness, the Learned Justice of the Supreme Court

has formulated the main issue that he has to determine in the following words: The question

8

that I have to determine is whether the evidence of witness de Silva, and the surrounding

circumstances disclose a probability that there was a threat, inducement or promise offered by

de Silva to the first accused to make the Statement P21. (at page 343 emphasis added). The

test formulated by the Learned Justice of the Supreme Court is whether it is probable and not

whether it is possible that the statement was made due to threat, promise or inducement. Not

mere possibility of the existence of such circumstance was the basis of rejecting the confession.

In this context it is of paramount importance to clearly identify and demarcate the parameters

within which Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance could be invoked. It is clear that a

determination on the irrelevancy of any statement in the context of Section 24 of the Evidence

Ordinance is, confined and limited to the circumstances where presence or existence of a threat,

promise or inducement is in issue and could not extend to encompass situations or circumstances

where the admissibility of any statement is challenged or any other ground. In a latter scenario,

the determination of that particular issue would be governed by the legal principles applicable to

the trial. As an illustration, if an accused person takes up the position that he never made a

statement to a witness who claims that the accused made a confessionary statement to him, the

burden on the prosecution is to prove that the accused made the statement as claimed by the

witness, beyond reasonable doubt. It does not have a burden to prove that the accused made such

a statement to mathematical precision. For a Judge not to act on such evidence a reasonable

doubt should exist. It is not lawful for the court to make a determination on the issue whether the

confession was made or not on the premise that it appears to court that no such statement has

been made.

In Mariadas v The State [1995] 1 SLR 96, the Court of Appeal considered the admissibility of a

confession in a situation where the accused denied making such a confession. In this process the

Court identified several infirmities in the prosecution case including the failure to call the typist

who recorded the confession, the failure to produce the pocket notebook of the investigating

officer and the failure to present evidence to rebut the allegations of assault. Having considered

all evidence transpired at the trial and having identified the aforementioned infirmities in the

prosecution case the Court held that ...the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable

doubt, that the confession was in fact made by the accused-appellant. (at page 107 emphasis

added).

9

Therefore, when the fact whether the accused made the confession or not is in issue, it is the duty

of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused made the confession. In

such a situation it is not lawful for a court to reject a confession on the basis that it appears to

court that the accused did not make the confession.

However, when the fact that the statement was made by the accused as claimed by the witness is

proved beyond reasonable doubt, then the court is obliged to consider whether it appears to court

that the statement was made involuntarily and should hold the statement irrelevant if it appears to

court that the confession has been made due to threat, promise or inducement as described by

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance. In my view this is the protection granted to an accused

under Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance and the fairness to an accused in criminal

proceedings should be assessed within such parameters in the context of assessing the

voluntariness of a confession. However, when a Court embarks on examining the voluntariness

of a confession court is obliged to act according to law, including the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance. The Court should not act on conjecture or surmise. Different standards of proof

would be applicable when a Court is considering the relevancy of a confessional statement of an

accused and the proof of his guilt. Furthermore, under Section 16(2) of the Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act as amended states that the burden of proving that a

confessional statement of an accused person made to an person of the rank of ASP or above shall

be on the person asserting it to be irrelevant under Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance.

It is also pertinent at this stage to note, Sections 109(2) and 110 (1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended (Code) set out the general law relating to recording of

statements by police officers. According to the proviso to Section 109(2) of the Code, an officer

or inquirer may record the statement in any of the national languages, in the event it is not

possible to record the statement in the language in which it is given and the person who makes

the statement is unable to make the statement in writing. In such a situation the statement so

recorded shall be read over to the witness or interpreted in the language he understands by the

officer who recorded the statement.

In this context it is pertinent to note that in The King v Karaly Muttiah et al. 41 NLR 172,

Moseley J at Page 174 observed that;

10

Another ground of objection was that the confession was made in Tamil to the

Superintendent who claims to have a knowledge of that language. It was, however,

recorded in English and was read over by the Superintendent to the accused in Tamil. It

does not seem to me that that procedure offends in any way against any provision in law.

It may be open to Counsel to submit to the jury that mistakes may have been made in

translating the confession from Tamil into English, and that further mistakes may have

been made by the translation back into Tamil for the benefit of the accused. That is a

submission which Counsel is clearly entitled to make, and it may be that such a

confession recorded in such circumstances will be treated somewhat carefully, but as I

have already said I can see no reason for holding a confession made in such

circumstances to be inadmissible.

The statutory provision stipulated in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act referred to

hereinbefore, is in no conflict with the aforesaid legal principle enumerated by Justice Moseley.

Therefore, there is no illegality per se in recording a statement of a witness in one of the official

languages, even though the statement is made in a different language. In my view the Court of

Appeal erred when it observed that it is essential to record any confession recorded under the

PTA in the language it was made, rather than translating it to a language alien to the maker of

the alleged statement in view of requirements of section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance in

Kedeeshwaran v The Attorney-General, CA/HCC/0194/2017, Judgement dated 25.05.2022.

Introducing such a requirement by way of a judicial pronouncement in the absence of such

provision in any of the relevant statutes including the Evidence Ordinance, the PTA or the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act as amended, amounts to the court making an attempt to legislate.

Especially when such a proposition is contrary to the statutory provisions in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. No Court could embark on such a process. The Courts duty is to

interpret the existing law and make determinations accordingly.

Let me now turn to the evidence presented before the High Court based on which, the Learned

High Court Judge made the Order dated 25th August 2017 and allowed the prosecution to

produce the statement the 1st Accused-Respondent made to the SP. Such examination of

11

evidence becomes necessary to consider the legal issues (2) and (3) on which leave has been

granted by this Court.

On behalf of the prosecution, evidence of ten witnesses had been presented. These witnesses

include the SP to whom the 1st Accused-Respondent alleged to have made the statement in

question, the typist who recorded the statement, six police officers who brought the 1st Accused-

Respondent from his place of detention to the SP and took him back, the police officer who

produced the Respondent before the JMO after the statement was recorded and the JMO. All

these witnesses had been cross examined by the Learned Counsel who represented the

Respondent in the trial Court.

According to the evidence of the typist, the typewritten statement in Sinhala was recorded on

five days between 19.04.2010 to 27.04.2010. More particularly, it had been recorded on 19th,

20th, 22nd, 26th and 27th April, 2020. This witness has identified in Court the statement she

prepared. The witness confirmed that the Respondent and the SP placed their signatures at the

conclusion of each day of recording the statement. Furthermore, according to her it was prepared

on paper where pages are serially machine numbered. The whole statement including a sketch

drawn by the Respondent that ran into four pages comprises of thirty nine pages. According to

this witness the SP translated the statement the Respondent made in Tamil into Sinhala and she

typed the statement in Sinhala. She further had said that the Respondent in certain instances

spoke in Sinhala too. She further said that the SP communicated with the Respondent in both

languages. At the end of the cross examination of this witness, it had been suggested to her that

she never recorded the statement but it was one Maheshika who typed written the statement and

the statement was not typed in the presence of the Respondent. The witness had denied these

suggestions and reiterated that it was she who typed the statement in the presence of the

Respondent and the SP.

Testimonies of the six witnesses who brought the Respondent from the place of detention to the

SP and returned back on different dates reveal that there had been no challenge to the fact that

they handed over the Respondent to the SP on the respective dates on which they claimed that

they took charge of the Respondent from his place of detention and produced before the ASP on

each day, other than a bare suggestion to one such witness that all what he testified are lies.

12

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the Respondent on both occasions (ie: on

19.04.2010 and 03.05.2010) had said that she communicated with the Respondent in Sinhala and

she observed that the Respondent spoke well in Sinhala. Furthermore, she said that the history

recorded in the medico legal report was provided to her by the Respondent in Sinhala where the

Respondent has said that he was an active member of the L.T.T.E and was arrested on 08th

August 2009. The JMO had not observed any injuries nor the Respondent had complained of any

such incident. The JMO had further concluded that he did not show any signs of any mental

illness. In cross examination it had been suggested that the Respondent did have no knowledge in

Sinhala, but the witness has refused to accept the suggestion. She had further explained that if the

Respondent spoke in Tamil, she would have made a record of the person who assisted her with

the translation and no such requirement arose as he spoke in Sinhala. Furthermore, this witness

has refused the suggestion by the Learned Counsel that the witness at no stage examined the

Respondent but handed over the perfected form to the police officer without examining the

Respondent.

The Police officer to whom the statement in question was made has been promoted to the rank of

Superintendent of Police (SP) after completion of thirty seven years of service. He had served as

an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) for eight years before been promoted to the rank of

Superintendent in the year 2008. According to his testimony in the examination in chief, he has

recorded around forty confessions from persons suspected of being involved in terrorist

activities, during his tenure in the police department. He works in three languages namely

Sinhala, Tamil and English. It is conceded that his competency is deficient to the extent that he is

unable to read or write in Tamil. According to him, during the first nine years of his education he

got the opportunity to attend Tamil medium classes at certain instances. Furthermore, he had said

that he grew up in an area where Tamil was commonly used. Thereafter, during his service in the

Police Department as a Sub Inspector and an Inspector he had served in many areas where

predominantly Tamil language is used. He had testified in courts in Tamil language. In relation

to the matters relevant to the case under consideration, he had initially received a direction from

the Director, Terrorist Investigation Division to meet with the Respondent and attend to his need.

According to the notes available, the Respondent has indicated to a police officer where he was

held in detention, that he wishes to speak to a senior police officer. Accordingly, the Respondent

was produced before him for the first time on 15th April 2010. The witness had inquired the

13

reason for his request and the Respondent had replied expressing his desire to make a statement

on the activities he was involved in. Thereafter, the witness having explained the consequences

of making such a statement had further interviewed the Respondent to satisfy himself that the

Respondent is not under any threat, promise or inducement. He had spent one hour with the

Respondent and thereafter had been handed over back to the police officer who produced him.

Thereafter, the witness had met the Respondent on the 19th April 2010. Having verified whether

the Respondent is under any threat, promise or inducement and been satisfied on his

voluntariness, the witness has commenced the interview after an adjournment during which

period he had the opportunity to examine the report of the JMO. When the witness requested the

Respondent to provide the statement in writing the latter had wanted it to be recorded by the

authorities, considering the volume of material that he had to disclose.

According to the witness all these discussions with the Respondent took place in Tamil.

Furthermore, the Respondent has not had any objections for the statement been recorded in

Sinhala. Thereafter, the statement has been recorded with the assistance of a typist who recorded

the statement in Sinhala. This witness also says that certain parts of the statement were made in

Sinhala. This process has continued in all four days through which the statement was recorded.

This witness has been subjected to cross-examination. Even during the cross examination, this

witness reiterated the manner in which he gained proficiency in Tamil language and no specific

challenge has been made to the ability of the witness to speak in Tamil. He had not been

challenged on the basis that no proper translation took place. Whereas the suggestion of the

Learned Counsel had been that the statement in question was never recorded before him.

At the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution, the Respondent has opted to make a

statement from the dock. He says that he was born in Jaffna and received education up to G.C.E.

(ordinary Level). At a later stage he had come down to Colombo and was engaged in some

textile business. The Respondent was 39 years at the time he was making the dock statement (in

2017). In his dock statement the Respondent says that Nimal Ratnayake (SP) told him the latter

is interested in learning the Tamil Language in response to a query the Respondent raised as to

the purpose for which he was brought. The Respondent takes up the position that he never made

a statement to the SP but signed some papers due to the threats made by one Subair. He further

denies the claim that he was conversant in Sinhala but says that he learned Sinhala while in

14

custody. He claims that it was one Subair who forced him to sign few papers and further claims

that he was subjected to assault when he initially refused. He says that a police officer was

present in the room when the JMO examined him. He denies that the JMO examined him. It is

also pertinent to note that the Respondent is silent on the prosecutions evidence that it was the

Respondent who drew the sketches and made a note in his hand writing in Tamil language in the

last four pages of the statement.

The other witness called on behalf of the Respondent was the OIC of the Terrorist Investigation

Division. According to this witness, in the year 2010 it was Chief Inspector Prasanna Alwis (as

he then was) who served as the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the Terrorist Investigation Division.

Having examined an Information Book that was maintained in April 2010, the witness has said

that OIC Prasanna Alwis has placed an entry on 7th April that he was travelling overseas for

training. Furthermore, according to the said entry, IP Jayakantha has been appointed to cover up

duties and CI Prasanna Alwis had left the roaming number to contact for necessary advice. He

had reported back for duties on 21st June 2010. However, this witness had not been able to say

whether CI Prasanna Alwis did engage in any official duties while overseas.

It appears that the objective of the last-mentioned evidence was to challenge the prosecution

evidence that the recording of the statement in question was made on the directions of the then

OIC, Prasanna Alwis. In particular the police officer who produced the Respondent before the SP

on 27th April 2010 had said that OIC Prasanna Alwis directed him to produce the Respondent

before the SP. In this regard it is pertinent to note that as per the evidence of PS 6747 Wijeratne,

while he was on guard duty on 2nd April 2010 the Respondent has expressed his desire to speak

to a higher officer. Accordingly, the witness has conveyed this request to Prasanna Alwis, the

OIC by an entry in the Information Book. According to the evidence of witness Nimal

Ratnayake, the OIC Prasanna Alwis has placed an entry addressed to the Director, below the

entry of witness Wijeratna. On 3rd April 2010, SP Ratnayake has received a direction from the

Director, TID to attend to the needs of the Respondent. It is also pertinent to note that there was

an appointment made to cover up the duties of the OIC during his physical absence from office

due to overseas training. Therefore, the inconsistency as to who made the directions thereafter to

produce the Respondent before the SP to record the statement in my view neither makes the

whole process illegal or unlawful nor creates a doubt on the rest of his testimony on matters

15

connected to the recording of the statement in question. In fact the Learned Trial Judge has

disallowed an application by the prosecution to call Prasanna Alwis as a witness in rebuttal.

It is based on the evidence set out hereinbefore, the Learned Trial Judge made the Order dated

25th August 2017. In his twelve page Order, the Learned Trial Judge has analysed the evidence

of each witness as well and has considered evidence as a whole in making the final

determination. In deciding on the voluntariness, the Learned Judge has considered all material

including the evidence of the JMO as well as the dock statement of the Respondent. Similarly, in

deciding on the competency of the ASP to translate the statement made by the Respondent in

Tamil into Sinhala, the Learned Trial Judge has taken into account all relevant evidence

including an instance where the SP himself corrected the translation of the official interpreter in

the course of his evidence in court. In this regard, neither the Respondent in his dock statement

disputed the competency of the SP to communicate in Tamil nor the Counsel suggested a

contrary to the SP on his evidence relating to his competency in spoken Tamil. The Learned

Trial Judge has also considered evidence of all witnesses who claimed that they conversed with

the Respondent in Sinhala including the evidence of the JMO and of PS Wijeratne on the

evidence relating to the Respondents ability to communicate in Sinhala. In this regard it is

pertinent to note that the Learned Trial Judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour and

deportment of all witnesses including the Respondent, who appeared before him.

In fact, the Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal, in their Judgment had not specifically

referred to any matter on which the Learned High Court Judge erred. In their Judgement the

Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal has said The main contention of the petitioner was that

the petitioner was tortured and inhumanly treated before obtaining the confession and thus it

was not at all voluntary and apart from that the typist who recorded the confession was dictated

by the ASP Nimal Ratnayake and not by the petitioner or the translator (at page 5). This

passage in the Judgment reflects that the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal have

misapprehended themselves on the position of the Respondent. The Respondents position is that

he never made a statement to SP Nimal Ratnayake and, at a later part in the Judgment, the

learned Justices had correctly observed that The position taken up by the petitioner at the

inquiry is that he never made the statement and in fact what he made was a statement to an

officer named Subair and no other. But it is observed that the ASP was not cross examined on

16

this, furthermore the evidence given by the ASP is uncontradicted and consistent (at page 6

emphasis added)

The Learned Justices however, having held as mentioned above observed that what has to be

decided here is whether the learned High Court Judge errored (sic) in deciding that the above

mentioned confession was made voluntarily or not (at page 6). In this process, thereafter, the

Learned Justices had not proceeded to consider the Respondents assertion that he was subjected

to assault and the evidence of prosecution witnesses including the JMO who examined the

Respondent twice, but observed The fact that whether the ASP to whom the confession was

made to was able to translate the same this court has to consider very seriously (at page 6).

In my view, by adopting the approach as reflected in the above portions of the Judgment, the

Learned Justices had failed to apprehend the distinction between these two issues, namely

voluntariness in the context of Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance and the issue on the

competency of the ASP to translate the statement, which has nothing to do with the issue on

voluntariness based on threat, promise or inducement as set out in Section 24 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

As I have already enumerated in this Judgement, the distinction between the challenges to a

confession based on voluntariness and challenges on other grounds has a clear impact on the

standard of proof. In the latter instances it is necessary to have a reasonable doubt whereas in

the former instance a confession can be declared irrelevant if it appears to court that the

confession is made due to threat, promise or inducement.

In fact, having examined the evidence of the SP in this regard, the Learned Justices had to come

to a finding that there is a reasonable doubt on the competency of the SP to translate the

statement from Tamil to Sinhala. Presence of a mere doubt is insufficient to declare a confession

irrelevant. Acting on conjecture or surmise cannot be permitted. The view of the Learned

Justices that .. the ASP himself translating the confession raises a doubt as to whether the

statement of the petitioner was translated in verbatim to the typist or not (at page 7), in my

view appears to have reached on conjecture and not on a reasonable doubt based on evidence

available. This is further reflected in their finding that to the petitioner it may have been a

17

daunting experience when the ASP himself was translating in view of his official position (at

page 7). It is rather difficult to comprehend this reasoning. The lack of clarity on the reasoning of

Learned Justices is further reflected in the following passage of the Judgment: Therefore this

court is of the view that since the recording of the confession expanded to nearly six days, the

most prudent thing the ASP could have done is to obtain the services of a translator on at least

on one or two days. (at page 7 - emphasis added). It is on this basis the Learned Justices of the

Court of Appeal held that the confession recorded in the instant case is in contravention of

the provisions of section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance. (at page 7). A clear distinction exists on

prudency and illegality. Lack of prudency does not necessarily lead to an illegality or

unlawfulness.

It is also pertinent to note that the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal has used the SPs

evidence that he referred to the dictionary in certain instances in explaining legal provisions to

conclude that there is a doubt whether the whole of the statement was translated in verbatim. In

this regard it is pertinent to note that the SPs evidence on this aspect is clear and the use of

dictionary was confined to the instance where he translated legal provisions in the Sinhala text to

Tamil. He does not say that he had to seek the aid of the dictionary in any other instance.

In my view the Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred by failing to analyse and evaluate

all relevant evidence presented at the voir dire inquiry, as required by law. Furthermore, the

Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal had erred by failing to adopt the proper legal tests as

enumerated hereinbefore, in holding that the confession is irrelevant under Section 24 of the

Evidence Ordinance. In view of these findings, I answer all three legal questions in the

affirmative.

I will now consider the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Respondent, that this is a fit

case to act on the proviso to Section 334 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of

1979 as amended even if the Court finds that the Learned Justices of the Court of Appeal had

erred. It is trite law that the dismissal of the appeal under this provision could take place if and

only if no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. In this instance, due to the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the prosecution has been deprived of the opportunity to present

one of the main items of evidence available against the Respondent at the trial. Such deprivation

18

has caused grave prejudice to the prosecution. Hence, this is not an instance where the Court

could dismiss the appeal.

For the reasons I have enumerated hereinbefore, I allow the appeal and set aside the Judgement

of the Court of Appeal dated 02.12.2021 and affirm the Order of the High Court dated

25.08.2017.
