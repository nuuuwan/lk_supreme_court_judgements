"Every inquiry under this section shall be concluded within sixty days"
"of the date fixed for the filing of objections."
"In this case the appellant by her petition tendered to the District Court"
"prima facie established that she has been in possession of the property"
"on her own account by virtue of a deed from an independent source. Her"
"possession  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  judgment-debtor.  In  Case  No."
"6482/L, the judgment-creditor was declared the owner of the property."
"Before this declaration was made, the judgment-creditor had obtained a"
"loan from Seylan Bank mortgaging this property. Due to his failure to pay"
"the loan, the Bank had sold the property by a public auction in terms of"
"the provisions of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act,"
"No.  4  of  1990  and  issued  the  Certificate  of  Sale  marked  P4  with  the"
"section  328  application.  Thereafter  the  Bank  sold  the  property  to  the"
"appellant by deed marked P2."
"As seen from the first paragraph of page 13 and the second paragraph of"
"page 14 of the judgment in Case No. 6482/L, the District Court refused"
"to stop the said public auction and expressly stated that the judgment"
"has no effect on the rights of the Bank. At the time the fiscal ejected the"
"appellant  and  handed  over  the  property  to  the  judgment-creditor,  the"
"latter was not the owner of the property. In point of fact, the judgment-"
"creditor lost ownership to the property long before the judgment in Case"
"No. 6482/L."
"Section  328  does  not  expressly  state  that  an  application  under  that"
"section  must  be  filed  in  the  main  case,  although  it  would  have  been"
"prudent to make the application in the main case itself given the nature"
"of the inquiry contemplated under this section."
