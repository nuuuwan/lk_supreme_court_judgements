In the execution of the decree in Case No. 6482/L of the District Court of

Kegalle, the appellant together with her family was ejected by the fiscal

on 07.12.2016. The appellant filed a separate application in the District

Court of Kegalle (148/C) under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code

3

SC/APPEAL/04/2023

within fifteen days of dispossession by way of petition and affidavit with

supporting documents seeking to restore her to possession. At the

inquiry into this application, the judgment-creditor (the 1st defendant-

petitioner-respondent) raised a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of the application on the basis that the appellant ought

to have made the application in the main case (6482/L) rather than in a

separate case. The learned District Judge by order dated 31.01.2019

overruled this preliminary objection emphasizing that there is a serious

matter to be looked into (which I will advert to later) and fixed the main

application for inquiry.

The judgment-creditor filed an appeal with leave obtained in the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Kegalle against the said order of the District

Court. The High Court by its judgment dated 10.07.2020 set aside the

order of the District Court on the basis that a separate action cannot be

filed seeking relief under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High

Court on the following two questions of law as formulated by the

appellant:

(a) Did the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by

failing to appreciate that the petitioners application under

section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code is in compliance with

all the requirements of the provisions of law?

(b) Did the Provincial High Court err in law in deciding that the

application by the petitioner under section 328 of the Civil

Procedure Code being registered as a separate action of claim

without being registered under the main action where the

decree has been entered, is not a mere technicality but a

fundamental error of procedure on the part of the petitioner,

4

SC/APPEAL/04/2023

when in fact the petitioner had sufficiently complied with all

the requirements in section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code?

In the first place, the High Court could not have entertained the leave to

appeal application in view of the positive bar in section 329 of the Civil

Procedure Code which states:

No appeal shall lie from any order made under section 326 or section

327 or section 328 against any party other than the judgment-

debtor. Any such order shall not bar the right of such party to

institute an action to establish his right or title to such property.

If there is no right of appeal, there is no right for leave to appeal. However,

the invocation of revisionary jurisdiction remains unaffected.

As the learned District Judge has stated, a serious miscarriage of justice

appears to have occurred in the execution of the decree.

Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Where any person other than the judgment-debtor or a person in

occupation under him is dispossessed of any property in execution

of a decree, he may, within fifteen days of such dispossession, apply

to the court by petition in which the judgment-creditor shall be

named respondent complaining of such dispossession. The court

shall thereupon serve a copy of such petition on such respondent

and require such respondent to file objections, if any, within fifteen

days of the service of the petition on him. Upon such objections being

filed or after the expiry of the date on which such objections were

directed to be filed, the court shall, after notice to all parties

concerned, hold an inquiry. Where the court is satisfied that the

person dispossessed was in possession of the whole or part of such

property on his own account or on account of some person other than

5

SC/APPEAL/04/2023

the judgment-debtor, it shall by order direct that the petitioner be put

into possession of the property or part thereof, as the case may be.

Every inquiry under this section shall be concluded within sixty days

of the date fixed for the filing of objections.

In this case the appellant by her petition tendered to the District Court

prima facie established that she has been in possession of the property

on her own account by virtue of a deed from an independent source. Her

possession had nothing to do with the judgment-debtor. In Case No.

6482/L, the judgment-creditor was declared the owner of the property.

Before this declaration was made, the judgment-creditor had obtained a

loan from Seylan Bank mortgaging this property. Due to his failure to pay

the loan, the Bank had sold the property by a public auction in terms of

the provisions of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 4 of 1990 and issued the Certificate of Sale marked P4 with the

section 328 application. Thereafter the Bank sold the property to the

appellant by deed marked P2.

As seen from the first paragraph of page 13 and the second paragraph of

page 14 of the judgment in Case No. 6482/L, the District Court refused

to stop the said public auction and expressly stated that the judgment

has no effect on the rights of the Bank. At the time the fiscal ejected the

appellant and handed over the property to the judgment-creditor, the

latter was not the owner of the property. In point of fact, the judgment-

creditor lost ownership to the property long before the judgment in Case

No. 6482/L.

Section 328 does not expressly state that an application under that

section must be filed in the main case, although it would have been

prudent to make the application in the main case itself given the nature

of the inquiry contemplated under this section.

6

SC/APPEAL/04/2023

Section 344 quoted below is applicable to the parties to the action. The

appellant was not a party to Case No. 6482/L.

All questions arising between the parties to the action in which the

decree was passed, or their legal representatives, and relating to the

execution of the decree, shall be determined by order of the court

executing the decree, and not by separate action.

In any event, a blatant miscarriage of justice cannot be suppressed by

technicalities. The procedural laws are there not to thwart justice but to

facilitate justice.

The two questions of law on which leave was granted are answered in the

affirmative.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the order of the

District Court dated 31.01.2019.

The District Court is directed to conclude the inquiry within sixty days of

the receipt of this judgment.

The judgment-creditor shall pay Rs. 200,000 to the appellant as costs of

this appeal and the appeal of the court below.
