"the  Respondents  are  correct.  The  applicable  standard  of  proof  in  such  applications  is  one  of  a"
"balance of probability."
"In  Gunawardena v. Perera and others [1983] 1 SLR 305 at page 313, Soza, J. stated;"
"“There can be no doubt that the burden is on the Petitioner to establish the"
"facts  on  which  she  invites  the  Court  to  grant  her  the  relief  she  seeks  […]  the"
"standard  of  proof  […]  is  proof  by  a  preponderance  of  probabilities  […]  It  is"
"generally  accepted  that  within  this  standard  there  could  be  varying  degrees  of"
"probability. The degree of probability required should be commensurate with the"
"gravity  of  the  allegation  sought  to  be  proved.  This  Court  when  called  upon  to"
"determine the question of infringement of fundamental rights will insist on a high"
"degree of probability as for instance a court having to decide a question of fraud"
"in a civil suit would. The conscience of the Court must be satisfied that there has"
"been an infringement.”"
