"Thus, there is no doubt whatsoever, that this Court will, at all times, protect, secure and"
"advance  human  dignity  and  protect  all  persons  from  torture,  cruel,  inhuman  and  degrading"
"treatment, under any condition, even in times of war, public danger or other emergency."
"Hence, when allegations of violation of Article 11 are made before this Court, the Court"
"must always ensure that full and meaningful steps are taken to safe guard such rights enshrined in"
"the Constitution."
"In order to fulfill such obligations this Court should primarily decide, upon evidence placed"
"before Court, whether the version of the Petitioner is correct or whether the version relied upon by"
"the  Respondents  are  correct.  The  applicable  standard  of  proof  in  such  applications  is  one  of  a"
"balance of probability."
