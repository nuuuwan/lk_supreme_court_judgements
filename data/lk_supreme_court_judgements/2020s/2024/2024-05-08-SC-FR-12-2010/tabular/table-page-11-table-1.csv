"“The duty of the 1st Respondent as a public servant had to perform is set out"
"in Section 74(5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No 1 of 1981 and empowered"
"the police to take such steps and use such force as may be reasonably necessary"
"for  prevention  of  contravention  of  election  laws.  Section  74(1)(b)  of  the  Act"
"prohibits the display of posters, in a place where the public have a right of access."
"The offence of such display of posters is a cognizable offence punishable with fine"
"or imprisonment or both. Therefore, the police arrested everybody at that time and"
"that arrest was lawful” (emphasis added)"
