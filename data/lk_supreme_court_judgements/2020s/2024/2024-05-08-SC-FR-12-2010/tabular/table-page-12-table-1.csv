"However, in the written submissions the 1st Respondent justifies using of force by police officers"
"in preventing a contravention of the provisions of the Elections Law. Hence, it appears that the 1st"
"Respondent by his written submissions, justifies the punch or the alleged assault on the face of the"
"Petitioner by police officers using a clenched fist."
"The next matter this Court is called upon to examine is who punched the Petitioner? Is it"
"the 1st Respondent? If so, did the 1st Respondent actually use ‘force’ on the Petitioner to prevent a"
"contravention of the Elections Law as stated in his written submissions? What is the ‘force’ used"
"by the 1st Respondent? Was it necessary or was it reasonable? Did the assault or the punch or the"
"blow given by the 1st Respondent as contended by the Petitioner, lead to the Petitioner’s loosening"
"of teeth?"
"The docket bears out that the 1st Respondent was indicted under Section 316 of the Penal"
"Code for causing grievous hurt on the Petitioner and was found guilty for an offence committed"
"under  Section  314  of  the  Penal  Code  and  sentenced.  Similarly,  the  docket  bears  out  that  the"
"Petitioner and four others were acquitted by the Magistrate of the charges filed against them under"
"Section 74(1) of the Presidential Elections Act."
"Whilst the Petitioner strenuously contended before this Court, that the punch inflicted on"
"the open mouth of the Petitioner resulted in the loosening of teeth and subsequent removal of three"
"teeth, the submission of the 1st Respondent was that the removal of the teeth was due to a surgery"
"performed by a doctor and not to any act of the 1st Respondent."
"The 1st Respondent also submitted based on the JMO’s report, that the Petitioner suffered"
"from severe periodontitis, which condition caused inflammation of the gums and therefore removal"
"of teeth was not due to any blow received from the 1st Respondent but due to weak teeth which the"
"Petitioner  was  having  prior  to  the  alleged  incident  and  thus,  the  Petitioner’s  injury  is  not"
"qualitatively of a reprehensible kind."
"The  1st  Respondent  further  submitted  that  according  to  the  JMO’s  report,  no  external"
"injuries on the face of the Petitioner had been observed and therefore without any external injury"
"the  Petitioner  cannot  contend,  that  there  was  a blow  or  that  the  1st  Respondent  used  his  fist  to"
"punch, especially in the absence of a crack on the lips or on the face of the Petitioner. Therefore"
"the 1st Respondent submitted, that the Petitioner has failed to prove with a high degree of certainty"
"that the 1st Respondent violated Article 11 of the Constitution."
"In  response  to  the  said  submissions  of  the  1st  Respondent,  the  Petitioner  contended,"
"although the 1st Respondent attempted to infer (through the subsequent IB extracts) that the injury"
"in question would have been resulted by the Petitioner falling when fleeing from the scene of the"
"incident, that such an inference cannot be drawn since the Petitioner did not suffer any external"
"injuries on his  face or mouth  as reflected in  the MLR. Further, the Petitioner contended, if the"
"Petitioner fell on his face, he would have suffered some external injuries and it is very unlikely"
"that one would fall on his face and only hit his teeth directly on the ground and get injured only"
"internally."
"Thus,  the  Petitioner  contended  that  the  explanation  of  the  1st  Respondent  is  beyond"
"comprehension.  The  Petitioner  re-iterated that  the  1st  Respondent  punched  the Petitioner  in  his"
"mouth while it was open, which resulted in no external injuries but in fact caused bleeding from"
