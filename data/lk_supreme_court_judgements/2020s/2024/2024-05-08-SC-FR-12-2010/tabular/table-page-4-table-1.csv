"whether  the  Petitioner  was  with  Palangasinghe  or  fled  away  when  the  jeep  in  which  the  1st"
"Respondent travelled approached the three persons."
"The 1st Respondent vehemently denied that he assaulted or punched the Petitioner or that"
"the 2nd Respondent accompanied the 1st Respondent on his patrol rounds and categorically denied"
"the narration of the Petitioner and went on to aver that it is a malicious fabrication and a deliberate"
"utterance of falsehood."
"The  objections  of  the  2nd  Respondent  was  a  general  denial  of  the  alleged  incident."
"Nevertheless,  he  admitted  that  he  too  went  on  routine  night  patrol  in  Hakmana  town  on  the"
"direction of the 1st Respondent [the officer-in-charge of the station], on the relevant night with"
"another officer and returned to the station  the next day morning. He also pleaded that he, with"
"another  police  officer  produced  Palangasinghe  to  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO)  on  20th"
"December, 2009 and annexed all the police entries of the said two dates to his affidavit."
"To the objections of the 1st Respondent was annexed a copy of the ‘B’ report [1R2] dated"
"21-12-2009 and extracts of police entries [1R1, 1R3 and 1R4] to substantiate his stand. 1R1 is an"
"in-out entry. 1R3 and 1R4 are notes pertaining to the arrest of Palangasinghe."
"This Court observes that whilst 1R3 refers to the arrest  per se, 1R4 refers to a more detailed"
"description of the arrest in line with the position taken up by the 1st Respondent in his objections"
"to this Court. Nevertheless, the Court notes that there is a significant discrepancy between 1R4 and"
"the selfsame arrest note tendered to this Court by the 2nd Respondent with his affidavit, wherein"
"specific reference is made to a person carrying a bucket of paste, two persons running away when"
"the  police  jeep  approached  them,  one  falling  down  on  the  road  and  thereafter  getting  up  and"
"running away."
"This Court also observes, that there are two documents marked 1R2 tendered to this Court,"
"the aforesaid B report and a  further report dated 07-01-2010. However, in the 1st Respondent’s"
"objections, no reference whatsoever is made to the further report and its content."
"The Petitioner in his counter affidavit denied the version of the 1st and 2nd Respondents"
"and re-iterated his stand, that the Petitioner identified both the 1st and 2nd Respondents at the scene"
"of the incident and the participation of the 2nd Respondent in the assault. Further, he pleaded that"
"he has no reason to falsely implicate the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner also re-iterated that he was"
"punched on the face by the 1st Respondent."
"Answering  further,  the  Petitioner  averred  that  the  arrest  note  [1R3]  prepared  by  the  1st"
"Respondent and marked and produced by him with his affidavit, contradicts the subsequent note"
"[1R4]  purportedly  prepared  on  10th  December,  2009  [a  date  prior  to  the  date  of  incident]  and"
"affixed on the information book on 20th December, 2009. The said 1R4 arrest note, the Petitioner"
"avers gives a more detailed report about the incident, viz., at the scene where Palangasinghe was"
"arrested there were two others with him; one was carrying a bucket; the said two persons ran away"
"from the scene; one knocked on an obstacle at the centre of the road, fell, thereafter got up and ran"
"away; and that the 1st Respondent could not apprehend the persons who fled. Further, the Petitioner"
"alleged that the version of the 1st Respondent as referred to in his objections filed of record is only"
