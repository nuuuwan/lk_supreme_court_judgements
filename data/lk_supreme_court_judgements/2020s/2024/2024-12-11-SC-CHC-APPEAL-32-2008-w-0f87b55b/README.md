Argued on: 11/09/2024

Decided on: 11/12/2024

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[1] By Plaint dated 25/01/2001, the Plaintiff-Respondent (sometimes referred to as the

Plaintiff Bank) filed this action against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants (now between

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Appellants) and sought to recover a sum of Rs.

8,307,207.19 together with due interest.

[2] In paragraph 4 of the Plaint, it is stated that the Plaintiff-Bank at the request of the

Defendants granted Bill Discounting facilities to the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

[3] In paragraph 5 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff stated that the 1st and 2nd Defendants

undertook to repay the said Bill Discounting facility up to Rs. 6,163,166.32 on the

due date together with interest thereon at the rate of 22% per annum.

[4] In paragraph 6 and 7 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff stated that as security for repayment

of the said Bill Discounting Facility, the 3rd Defendant by Mortgage Bond Nos. 838

and 1206, marked A and B in this Plaint, mortgaged and hypothecated land and

premises morefully described in the schedule thereto, and that by the said Mortgage

Bonds the 1st and 2nd Defendants agreed to repay on demand the full sum set out

therein.

[5] In paragraph 9 of the Plaint, it is stated that the said sum is due and owing from the

1st and 2nd Defendants to the Plaintiff-Bank upon the Bill of Exchange No. 41825

dated 01/07/1998, which became payable on 31/07/1998, marked and pleaded as

D in this Plaint.

P a g e 4 | 14

[6] Claiming in paragraph 12 of the Plaint, that the Defendants have made default in the

repayment of the said banking facility, the Plaintiff filed this action as aforesaid, to

sue the Defendants jointly and/ or severally for the recovery of the said sum of Rs.

8,307,207.19 together with interest at the rate of 24% p.a.

[7] The 2nd and 3rd Defendants filed separate Answers, both dated 19/01/2004.

[8] In paragraph 4 of the answer, the 2nd Defendant admitted the averments contained

in paragraphs 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the Plaint, however, stated inter alia, that the

Plaintiffs claim is not justified and is bad in law. In the admissions recorded in the

Commercial High Court on 09/03/2005, the 2nd Defendant has admitted paragraph

5 of the Plaint.

[9] In paragraph 10 of the Answer, the 3rd Defendant states that she is a person governed

by Tesawalami and is subjected to matrimonial powers of her husband, thus

without consent or concurrence of her husband, the execution of the said Mortgage

Bonds lacks legal validity.

[10] Having considered the pleadings, the evidence led and the written submissions

tendered by the respective parties the learned High Court Judge by judgment dated

01/04/2008 decided that the Plaintiff-Bank has proved its case and accordingly

made judgment in favor of the Plaintiff-Bank.

[11] Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Appellants, by

separate petitions dated 30/05/2008 and 29/05/2008 respectively, are before this

Court to set aside the said Judgment dated 01/04/2008, delivered by the Commercial

High Court of Colombo.

[12] The Plaintiff submits that since the 1st Defendant, the mother of the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants is deceased, this action proceeded only against the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants.

P a g e 5 | 14

[13] The 2nd Defendant has admitted that the 1st and 2nd Defendants obtained Bill

Discounting Facilities up to Rs. 6,163,166.32, as security subject to the terms and

conditions set out in the Mortgage Bonds Nos. 838 and 1206, marked A and B

(now marked P2 and P3), and agreed to repay on demand the full sum set out

therein.

[14] The said facility was granted to the 1st and 2nd Defendants as borrowers and the 3rd

Defendant as obligor.

[15] The Plaintiffs evidence in chief was by affidavit and the Plaintiff produced

documents marked P1 to P15. The following security documentation was

tendered in connection with the said facility obtained.

The offer letter of the Bill Discounting Facility which the 1st and 2nd

Defendants signed and accepted, marked P1

The Mortgage Bonds Nos. 838 and 1206 executed by the 1st and 2nd

Defendants, marked P2 and P3

The bill of exchange No. 41825 drawn by the 1st and 2nd Defendants agreeing

to pay the sum mentioned therein on the due date, marked P5

The statement of accounts, marked P12, which reflects the sum of Rs.

8,307,207.19 due to the Plaintiff from the Defendants upon the bill of

exchange, marked P5.

[16] The Plaintiff has also led in evidence letters written to the 1st and 2nd Defendants,

marked P6 to P10, which sets out the monies due and owing.

[17] By letter dated 08/04/1999 marked P11, the 2nd Defendant has agreed to re pay

Bill of Exchange No. 41825 for Rs. 6,163,166.30 and has acknowledged the

Plaintiffs letter dated 17/03/99, as the final reminder to settle the overdue Bill.

P a g e 6 | 14

[18] In the circumstances, the Plaintiff-Bank takes up the position that the Defendants

admitted that the said sum of Rs. 6,163,168.32 was given by the Bill of Exchange

produced marked P5 and that the Defendants had failed to pay the said sum with

interest as shown in the statement of accounts marked P12.

[19] It is not in dispute that at the request of the Defendants, the Plaintiff granted bill

discounting facilities to the 1st and 2nd Defendants and that the 3rd Defendant signed

Mortgage Bonds No. 838 dated 20/06/1996 and No. 1206 dated 01/07/1998, as

security for repayment on demand sums of monies that are due and owing from the

Defendants to the Plaintiff-Bank by the said facility.

[20] The Defendants by their letter dated 08/04/1999, has acknowledged the said debt

and agreed to repay the same. Additionally, in cross examination, the 2nd Defendant

has admitted obtaining the said bill discounting facility and its non-payment. [vide

proceedings dated 17/01/52007]

Q: There is a due date upon which you have to make payment in terms of the bill

discounting facility

A: Yes

Q: and you did not make the payment.

A: Yes

[21] In the circumstances, it is the position of the Plaintiff-Bank that the 2nd Defendant

has admitted that he received and benefited by the bill discounting facility and that

having agreed to pay the sum of Rs. 6,163,168.32 upon the said Bill, has failed to

do so.

[22] The 2nd Defendants position before the Commercial High Court was that he had

settled in excess of Rs. 5.3 million to the Plaintiff-Bank and has produced receipts

to confirm the said payment, which the 2nd Defendant contends, the Plaintiff-Bank

has not challenged.

P a g e 7 | 14

The claim by the 2nd Defendant-Appellant of settling in excess of Rs. 5.3 million.

[23] The offer letter dated 01/07/1998, marked P1, was an application to reschedule the

existing Bill Discounting facility of Rs. 5,000,000/- to a new limit of Rs.

6,163,166.32 approved by the Plaintiff-Bank, under the offer letter dated

01/07/1998, which is now claimed by the Plaintiff-Bank as due.

[24] In paragraph 9 of the affidavit dated 06/12/2006, tendered as evidence in chief by

the 2nd Defendant, states that, payments amounting to a sum in excess of Rs. 5.3

million in respect of the bill discounting facility granted in 1994 and the

enhancement in 1998 had been made, and has tendered copies of the receipts issued

by the Plaintiff-Bank, acknowledging payments of the said sum, marked 2D2 to

2D29.

[25] In cross examination the 2nd Defendant admitted that in 1998, the outstanding

interest of Rs. 1,100,000 due on the previous facility was capitalized and included

in the principal amount which was due and owing to the Plaintiff-Bank.

[26] The 2nd Defendant has admitted that he agreed with the bank to add the outstanding

interest to the Bill Discounting facility obtained in 1998, which is reflected in

Document marked P5, and that he agreed to pay the sum mentioned in P5, which

is the Bill Discounting facility upon which this action has been instituted. It is also

admitted by the 2nd Defendant that 2D1 to 2D26 were payments made prior to

the existence of P5.

[27] In this background, in Judgment dated 01/04/2008, the learned Judge of the

Commercial High Court has correctly observed that;

It is further admitted by the 2nd Defendant that he agreed to pay the sum stated in

the document marked P5. In cross examination the 2nd Defendant also admitted that

although he undertook to pay the sum stated in the above document marked P5, he

has failed to make the payments accordingly. it is observed in the cross examination

P a g e 8 | 14

that the 2nd Defendant has admitted the fact that the documents marked 2D (2) to

2D (27) indicate the part payments made prior to the date of the document marked

P5.

[28] In the aforesaid circumstances, taking into consideration the payments made by the

2nd Defendant, I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Commercial High

Court made no error in calculating the sum claimed by the Plaintiff-Bank.

[29] When this matter was taken up for hearing before this Court, the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant challenged the Plaintiffs action in the Commercial High Court, on the

basis that;

I. the 1st Defendant had passed away in or about July 2000, long prior to the

filling of this action. Therefore, naming the 1st Defendant in the Plaint is bad

in law,

II. a misjoinder of the alleged causes of action pleaded against the 1st and 2nd

Defendants in respect of the Bill Discounting Facility and against the 3rd

Defendant in respect of the Mortgage Bonds in suit,

III. as per the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, a Bill must be presented for payment

to the 2nd Defendant before making a claim, which was not done in

accordance with Section 45 of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, [30] At the very outset, if I may deal with No. III above, the argument that the Bill of

Exchange was not presented for payment in accordance with Section 45 of the Bills

of Exchange Ordinance was raised for the first time in these proceedings during the

pre-hearing written submissions. This argument is wholly inconsistent with the

principles professed in Section 150, Explanation 2, of the Civil Procedure Code

which explicitly states that "The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the

partys pleading, i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. And no party can be

allowed to make at the trial a case materially different from that which he has placed

on record, and which his opponent is prepared to meet. And the facts proposed to

P a g e 9 | 14

be established must in the whole amount to so much of the material part of his case

as is not admitted in his opponents pleadings.

[31] In the present case, the Defendants-Appellants did not raise this issue in their

pleadings, nor was it framed as an issue during trial. Furthermore, this position was

never put in issue when the Plaintiffs witness was under cross examination. By

raising this argument only at the pre-hearing stage, the Defendants-Appellants has

materially altered their case which goes against the procedural safeguards provided

in the Civil Procedure Code. As observed in Thalwatte vs. Somasundaram1, a party

cannot raise new grounds on appeal or at a later stage of proceedings if such issues

were neither reflected in the pleadings nor framed as issues during trial. In this case,

the Supreme Court refused to entertain a new argument on appropriation of

payments because it fundamentally altered the nature of the case originally

presented.

[32] Similarly, the Defendants-Appellants in the present case failed to raise any objection

regarding the presentation of the Bill during trial or cross-examination, and the

pleadings contain no defence on this ground. Allowing such a defence to be

introduced at this stage would prejudice the interests of the Plaintiff-Bank, which

was not afforded an opportunity to address or counter this argument at any stage

during the trial.

[33] This Court is of the view that introducing a new defence post-trial, undermines

procedural integrity and fairness, especially when such a defence involves mixed

questions of fact and law that should have been considered during the trial stage.

Accordingly, the argument regarding non-presentation of the Bill for payment does

not merit consideration.

Nos. I and II

[34] This action was filed on the basis that the Defendants were jointly and/ or severally

liable for the recovery of the stated sum. Where one of the makers of a joint

promissory note granted in consideration of a sum of money lent by the payee to the

makers, dies, on the note itself it is open to the payee to sue only the surviving

maker. (Vaitilingam vs. Karunakarar2).

[35] It is an admitted fact that the action of the Plaintiff-Bank has been instituted on the

basis that at all times material to this action, the 1st and 2nd Defendants have been

carrying on business in partnership under the name, style and firm of E.

Nallathamby, at No. 141, main street, Negambo.

[36] The 1st and 2nd Defendants drew and accepted the Bill of exchange dated

01/07/1998, agreeing to pay the sum mentioned and delivered to the Plaintiff-Bank,

which is produced marked P5. As per the said document marked P5, the 1st and

2nd Defendants promised and agreed that they will pay the said sum of Rs.

6,163,166.32 to the Plaintiff-Bank on the due date.

[37] On the death of a partner who had granted the note, its holder sued thereon the

surviving partners only. It was held that the action was not bad for non-joinder of

the legal representatives of the deceased partner. In the case of a partnership, each

member is severally bound, and may be sued separately on a note made by one in

the name of the partnership (Muttiah Chetty vs. De Silva et al3).

[38] In Uragoda v. Jayasinghe and Others4 the plaintiff sued Dr. Uragoda (1st

defendant) and the partners of "Glass House" (2nd to 6th defendants) and sought

2 22 NLR 343

3 3NLR 59

4 2004 1SLR 108

P a g e 11 | 14

damages for alleged medical negligence. The defendants raised an objection during

the trial and argued that they could not be sued together. The court held that as per

section 22 of the Civil Procedure Code, objections regarding the misjoinder must be

raised at the earliest possible opportunity and such objections are required to be

made prior to the commencement of the hearing. The court observed that if such

objections were not raised within this time, the defendants are deemed to have

waived their right to object. The court further explained that as per Section 91 of the

Civil Procedure Code. such objections should be submitted before the hearing by

filing a motion accompanied by a written memorandum.

The Court cited Adlin Fernando v. Lionel Fernando5 where Ranaraja, J. has stated

that provisions relating to joinder are procedural and not substantive, and courts

should adopt a common-sense approach in deciding questions of misjoinder or non-

joinder. The court also cited Podihamy v Simon Appuhamy6 where it was held that

the court should not be fettered by technical objections on matters of procedure.

Similarly, in the present case, the claims against the Defendants, arising from the

Bill Discounting Facility and associated Mortgage Bonds are interconnected and

stem from a shared factual and a transactional background. Therefore, this Court

does not observe any irregularity in disposing those two matters in the same trial.

[39] Moreover, there is no provision in the Civil Procedure Code or any other law

requiring an action to be dismissed where there is a misjoinder of causes of action.;

and that is therefore, improper for the Court to dismiss an action on the ground of

misjoinder of Defendants and causes of action, without giving an opportunity to the

5 1995 2SLR 25

6 47 NLR 503

P a g e 12 | 14

Plaintiff to amend his Plaint. (D. Appuhamy et al. vs. T. Pangnananda Thero et

al7, Wismaloma et al. vs. Azapatha8)

[40] Therefore, invoking a question on misjoinder at the appeal stage, does not merit

consideration. For these reasons I reject the propositions taken by the Defendants-

Appellants in respect of Nos. I, II, and III as stated earlier in this Judgment.

The Application of Tesawalamai law to the 3rd Defendant-Appellant.

[41] In paragraph 3 of the Answer dated 19/01/2004 and in the admissions recorded in

the proceedings dated 09/03/2005, the 3rd Defendant admitted that she was aware of

a contract which was entered into between the parties. Also has taken up the position

that she is a person governed by Thesawalamai and thus is subjected to the

matrimonial power of her husband and that by law, all acts and deeds concerning

her property require the consent and concurrence of her husband. It is also the

position of the 3rd Defendant that it is an imperative requirement that no action can

be filed against her without making her husband a party to an action.

[42] On the legal validity of the said Mortgage Bonds No. 838 and 1206 dated

20/06/1996 and 01/07/1998 respectively, the only substantive question of law put

in issue by the 3rd Defendant was regarding the legal validity of the execution of the

Bonds, for the reason that the 3rd Defendants husband did not grant his consent or

concurrence either for the said authorization or the execution of the said Mortgage

Bonds.

[43] On the above stand, the Commercial High Court concluded that;

The 1st Defendant who is the lawful Attorney of the 3rd Defendant and her husband,

under and by virtue of Power Attorney attested in England by J. M. Jones Notary

7 67 NLR 89

8 45 CLW 67

P a g e 13 | 14

Public on 19th Match 1996 has duly executed the said Mortgage Bonds and duly

mortgaged and hypothecated the said property with the Plaintiff-Bank.

[44] In proceedings before the Commercial High Court, the learned Counsel appearing

for the 3rd Defendant stated that --- in the light of Honours order refusing a

postponement for the 3rd Defendant to give evidence ---- I close my case without

calling any witnesses [Vide proceedings dated 19/07/2007], which is an

acknowledgment that the 3rd Defendant failed to tender the affidavit in evidence or

to assert her position in evidence.

[45] Commenting on the 3rd Defendants case before Court, the learned Judge of the

Commercial High Court concluded that;

It is to be noted at this juncture that the 3rd Defendant in this action has tendered

the examination-in-chief by way of an affidavit. But has not subjected herself for

cross examination to assert her position in this action. After filling the affidavit has

not made her appearance [sic]. Therefore, any position taken by the 3rd Defendant

has not been proved and has not established her rights.

[46] Therefore, the proceedings before the Commercial High Court, dated 19/07/2007

makes it abundantly clear that the learned Counsel closed the case for the 3rd

Defendant, without calling the 3rd Defendant or any other witness to give evidence,

on her behalf.

[47] In this regard, it is pertinent to note that, as held in the case of Mohamed Feuz and

another vs. Sala Umma and another9 where Basnayake CJ held, that evidence does

not become legal evidence by mere fact that it passes into the record of the

9 LVII CLW 47

P a g e 14 | 14

proceedings unnoticed by the judge or without objection being taken from the

opposite side.

[48] For the above reasons I am of the view that the 3rd Defendant has not asserted her

position taken in the said answer dated 19/01/2004, by evidence before Court, to

establish that she is governed by the law of Thesawalamai.

[49] In the said circumstances, I agree with the conclusions made by the learned Judge

of the Commercial High Court and I am of the view that, the stand taken by the 3rd

Defendant, that she is a person governed by Thesawalamai law was not established

and therefore, the 3rd Defendants obligation to pay the Plaintiff-Bank survives.

[50] For these reasons, the Judgement of the Commercial High Court is affirmed; both

appeals are dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 150,000/-
