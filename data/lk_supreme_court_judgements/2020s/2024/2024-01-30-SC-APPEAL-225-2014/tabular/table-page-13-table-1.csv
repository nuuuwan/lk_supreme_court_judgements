"In Bandara v. Piyasena (1974) 77 NLR 102 where facts were similar to",""
"the facts of the instant appeal, the Supreme Court held as follows:",""
"","Learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned District"
"","Judge has clearly held that the house in the premises in suit was"
"","the house taken by the defendant on the lease bond P4 of 5.12.1960."
"","The question does arise as to whether the plaintiff can maintain this"
"","action for ejectment of the defendant. The defendant has sought to"
"","resist the claim of the plaintiff on the footing of certain interests in"
"","this land which he has acquired on a deed of 10.5.1962 during the"
"period  of","the 
lease.  The  District  Judge  observes 
that  as 
the"
"","defendant is a co-owner of this land, the plaintiff is not entitled to"
"","maintain this action against the defendant for a declaration of title"
"","to a building put up by him in the common property."
"","Dr. Wickremesinghe has drawn our attention to Maasdorp Book III"
"","page 216, where he observes that a lessee is not entitled to dispute"
"","his  landlordâ€™s  title  and  consequently  he  cannot  refuse  to  give  up"
"","possession  of  the  property  at  the  termination  of  his  lease  on  the"
"","ground that he is himself the rightful owner of the said property. His"
"","duty in such a case is first to restore the property to the lessor and"
"","then litigate with him as to the ownership. (See also Voet 19 Tit. 2"
"","Section  32)  where  it  has  been  set  out  that  the  setting  up  of  any"
"","defence of ownership of the lessee cannot stay the restoration of the"
"property","leased,  even  though,  perhaps,  the  proof  of  ownership"
"","cannot be easy for the lessee. He ought in every event to give back"
"","possession first and then litigate about the proprietorship."
"","In  the  light  of  these  principles  which  are  not  questioned  by  Mr."
"","Amerasinghe,  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent,  we  are  of  the"
"view 
that","there 
is  a  merit 
in 
the  submissions  made  by  Dr."
"","Wickremesinghe that the District Judge was in error in holding that"
