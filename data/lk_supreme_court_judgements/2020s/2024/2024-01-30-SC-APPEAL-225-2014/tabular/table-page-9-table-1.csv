"alleged  to  have  been  executed  on  16.08.1990,  which 
is  during  the"
"operation of the lease agreement. It is not even a photocopy of the original"
"deed. It is not a registered deed at the Land Registry. By way of issues,"
"the position taken up by the 2nd defendant was not that he is a co-owner"
"of the land but that he is the owner of premises No. 13 by deed 2V1 (vide"
"issue No. 26)."
"The plaintiff’s action is neither a rei vindicatio nor a declaration of"
"title, but rather, an action for ejectment"
"The plaintiff’s action is not a rei vindicatio action. Although the plaintiff"
"sought  a  declaration  of  title  to  the  premises  in  suit  in  addition  to  the"
"ejectment  of  the  defendants,  what  the  plaintiff  filed  was  an  action  for"
"ejectment based on the violation of the lease agreement. In an ejectment"
"action,  the  plaintiff  must  show  a  present  right  to  possession  of  the"
"property  withheld  by  the  defendant.  In  cases  where  a  plaintiff  files  an"
"action for ejectment on a breach of agreement, as in this instance, there"
"is no legal requirement to seek a declaration of title to the premises in"
"suit, although it is done as a matter of practice. If a declaration of title is"
"sought 
in  such  action,  the  Court  can  grant  that  relief  against  the"
"defendant not because the plaintiff has proved title to the premises but"
"because the defendant is debarred from disputing the plaintiff’s title by"
"operation of law. This was lucidly explained by Gratiaen J. in Pathirana"
"v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172-173:"
