"for the plaintiff only for his half share. On appeal, Bonser C.J. stated at"
"Now, it appears that the plaintiff can only prove title to a half of the"
"land.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  this  case  to  state  the"
"devolution of the title, for even though the ownership of one-half of"
"this land were in the defendant himself, it would seem that by our"
"law, having been let into possession of the whole by the plaintiff, it"
"is not open to him to refuse to give up possession to his lessor at the"
"expiration of his lease. He must first give up possession, and then it"
"will be open to him to litigate about the ownership (see Voet XIX. 2."
"32)."
