"absence of declaration of title in favour of the Plaintiff is not entitled"
"act upon such cause of action already prescribed."
"Prescription  can  take  the  form  of  acquisitive  prescription,  serving  as  a"
"mode of acquiring title, or extinctive prescription, acting as a defence or"
"bar to prosecution. The plea of prescription to be sustained in law must"
"be taken up in the pleadings. It cannot be raised as an issue at the trial"
"without expressly pleaded in the answer, unless the plaintiff consents to"
"it. It cannot be raised as an issue while the trial is in progress. Needless"
"to say, it cannot be taken up for the first time in appeal."
"The Prescription Ordinance only limits the time within which an action"
"may  be  instituted  but  it  does  not  prohibit  an  action  being  instituted"
"outside  the  stipulated  time  limit.  If  the  objection  is  not  raised  by  the"
"opposite  party  in  the  pleadings,  the  opposite  party  is  deemed  to  have"
"waived it and acquiesced in the action being tried on the merits."
"The judge cannot take up the plea of prescription ex mero motu because"
"a party can waive such objection. Chitty on Contract, Vol I, 33rd edn, para"
"28-108 states “A party is not bound to rely on limitation as a defence if he"
"does not wish to do  so. In general, the court will not raise the point suo"
"officio  even  if  it  appears  from  the  face  of  the  pleading  that  the  relevant"
"period of limitation has expired.” Chitty at para 28-127 states “Limitation"
"is a procedural matter, and not one of substance”."
