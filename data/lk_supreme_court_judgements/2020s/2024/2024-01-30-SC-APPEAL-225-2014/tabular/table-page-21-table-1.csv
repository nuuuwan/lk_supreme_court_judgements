"In this action the answer did not state that the cause of action was",""
"prescribed in law. For the first time this defence was permitted after",""
"the commencement of the evidence. A practice which in my view is",""
"both repugnant to law, reasonableness and fair play and from which",""
"judges  should  desist.  In  any  event  the  defendant-respondent  has",""
"denied  all  the  acts  of  nuisance  acts  pleaded,  but  also  for  some",""
"inexplicable reason  pleaded non-deterioration. Therefore, a plea of",""
"prescription cannot arise without the act or acts of nuisance being",""
"admitted  whereas  the  defendant-respondent  has  in  his  answer",""
"specifically denied them. The plea is, therefore, not only in law, but",""
"also  at 
the  stage","it  was  so  done,  both  bad 
in 
law,  but  also"
"contradictory in itself.",""
"The  acceptation  of","these 
issues 
is  also  repugnant 
to 
the 
law"
"inasmuch as the date of commencement of prescription is vague in",""
"that the absence of a plea as to whether it was the acts of nuisance",""
"or the date of the notice to quit. It is, therefore, additionally for the",""
"same reason of reasonableness that as is required by section 44 of",""
"the  Civil  Procedure  Code  that  a  plea  of  the  reasons  for  the  non-",""
"operation or application of prescription is mandatory that it is equally",""
"reasonable  and 
fair","that 
the 
law  requires 
that 
the  defence  of"
"prescription be specifically pleaded in the answer.",""
"I am, therefore, of the view that issues 7, 8 and 9 should not have",""
"been  accepted  as","issues 
for  adjudication  and 
that 
the  order"
"accepting  them  is  bad,  insupportable  and  made  per  incuriam.  I,",""
