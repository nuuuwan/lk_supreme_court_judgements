"should  not  have  accepted  those  issues  as  the  defendant  did  not  plead"
"such defence in the answer. Justice Weerasekera at 309-310 states:"
"Presumably, the defence taken in the issue is based on section 10 of"
"the Prescription Ordinance. The acts of nuisance complained of are"
"thus sought to be shown to have taken place long prior to the 3-year"
"period. To that the plaintiff-appellant’s answer is that the application"
"of the defendant-respondent to the National Housing Department for"
"the  premises  to  purchase  was  finally  concluded  only  2  months"
"before the institution of the action."
"Be that as it may the position in law is quite clear and settled. In the"
"case of Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekera 50 NLR 253 Basnayake"
"J. held: “Where the effect of the Prescription Ordinance is merely to"
"limit the time within which an action may be brought, the Court will"
"not take the statute into account unless it is expressly pleaded by"
"way of defence.”"
"It is, therefore, settled law and that for salutary reasons lest all the"
"basic rules of law particularly that of the rule of audi alteram partem"
"that if a party to an action intends to raise the plea of prescription it"
"is obligatory on his part to plead that in his pleadings. I say salutary"
"because  reason,  justice  and  fair  play  demands  that  the  opposing"
"party be given an opportunity of making such a plea and that party"
"or no party should not be taken unawares of a defence taken that"
"the action is barred by lapse of time."
