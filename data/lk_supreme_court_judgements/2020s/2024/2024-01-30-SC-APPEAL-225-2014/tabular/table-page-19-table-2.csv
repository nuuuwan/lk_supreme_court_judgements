"In  Brampy  Appuhamy  v.  Gunasekere","(1948)  50  NLR  253  at  255"
"Basnayake J. (later C.J.) held:",""
"","An  attempt  was  made  to  argue  that  the  defendant’s  claim  was"
"","barred by the Prescription Ordinance (Cap. 55). The plea is not taken"
"","in  the  plaintiff’s  replication.  There  is  no  issue  on  the  point,  nor  is"
"","there  any  evidence  touching  it.  The  plaintiff  was  represented  by"
"","counsel throughout the trial. In these circumstances the plaintiff is"
"","not entitled to raise the question at this stage. It is settled law that"
"","when,  as  in  the  case  of  sections  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10  and  11  of  the"
"","Prescription Ordinance, the effect of the statute is merely to limit the"
"","time in which an action may be brought  and not to extinguish the"
"","right,  the  court  will  not  take  the  statute  into  account  unless  it  is"
"specially pleaded by way of defence.",""
