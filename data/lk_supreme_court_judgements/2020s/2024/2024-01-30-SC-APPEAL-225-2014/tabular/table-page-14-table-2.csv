"We would accordingly enter judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for."
"The plaintiff shall be entitled to the costs of action and of this appeal."
"The High Court states “the 2nd defendant cannot be treated as a lessee of"
"the plaintiff in the eyes of the law and he claimed to be another co-owner"
"of the property.” I accept that the 2nd defendant cannot be treated as a"
"lessee of the plaintiff. But as I stated previously the 2nd defendant comes"
"under the original lessee, the 1st defendant. With the eviction of the 1st"
"defendant, her subordinates, agents, servants etc. should all leave. The"
"normal  rule  is  that  the  branch  falls  with  the  tree;  ending  of  the  1st"
"defendant’s standing in the premises would also have the effect of ending"
"that of her  subordinates.  The 2nd defendant cannot create a  purported"
"ownership or co-ownership during the subsistence of the lease agreement"
"and thwart the action of the plaintiff."
"For the sake of completeness, it is worth noting that if an action is filed"
"for  ejectment  against  such  defendant  who  originally  entered 
into"
"possession 
in  a  subordinate  character,  and  such  defendant  claims"
"prescriptive  title  to  the  property  (which  is  an  arduous  task)  by  stating"
"that he changed the character of possession from subordinate to adverse"
"by  an  overt  act 
(as 
the  starting  point  of  adverse  possession)  and"
"continued  such  adverse  possession  for  over  10  years  as  required  by"
"section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the rigidity of the said principle"
"can be relaxed. In such circumstances, the defendant is not compelled to"
"surrender possession as a prerequisite for establishing his prescriptive"
"title."
