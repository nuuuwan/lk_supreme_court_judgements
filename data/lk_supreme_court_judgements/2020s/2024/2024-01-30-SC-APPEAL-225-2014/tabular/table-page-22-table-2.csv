"Prasanna Jayawardena J. held that the defendant could not have taken"
"up the defence of prescription for the first time in appeal."
"[I]t is settled Law that, a party is prohibited from raising an issue"
"regarding  prescription  for  the  first  time  in  appeal.  As  Bonser  C.J."
"described in the early case of TERUNNANSE vs. MENIKE [1 NLR 200"
"at p.202], a defence of prescription is a “shield” and not a “weapon"
"of  offence”.  Adopting  the  phraseology  used  by  the  learned  Chief"
"Justice  over  a  century  ago,  it  may  be  said  that,  if  a  Defendant"
"chooses not to pick up the shield of prescription when he goes into"
"battle at the trial, the ‘rules of combat’ are that he forfeits the use of"
"that shield in appeal."
