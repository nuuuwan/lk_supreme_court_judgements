"v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172-173:"
"In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is"
"entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery"
"of  the  property  and  for  the  ejectment  of  the  person  in  wrongful"
"occupation.  “The  plaintiff’s  ownership  of  the  thing  is  of  the  very"
"essence of the action”. Maasdorp’s Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96."
