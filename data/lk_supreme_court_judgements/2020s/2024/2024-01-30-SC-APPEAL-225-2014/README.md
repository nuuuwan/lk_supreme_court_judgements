Background

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Matale on 22.05.2002

on the basis that he leased out premises No. 13, Kalawewa Road,

Galewela, morefully described in the schedule to the plaint, to the 1st

defendant by lease agreement marked P2 dated 05.09.1988 for a period

of four years from 01.09.1988 to 01.09.1992 subject to the terms and

conditions stated therein but the 1st defendant together with her brother,

the 2nd defendant, continues to be in possession without yielding up

possession of the premises to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought a

declaration of title to the said premises, ejectment of the two defendants

therefrom and damages.

4

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

The 1st defendant in the answer admitted that she was the lessee of the

premises by P2 but stated that she was never given possession of the

premises. She prayed for an order directing the plaintiff to release the

refundable deposit of Rs. 100,000 deposited with the plaintiff at the time

of the execution of the said lease agreement. The 1st defendant did not in

my view contest the plaintiffs case in all three Courts. The 1st defendant

did not give evidence, nor did she call any witnesses despite the plaintiff

giving affirmative evidence that possession of the premises was handed

over to the 1st defendant in the presence of the 2nd defendant and the

defendants father, Illiyas, at the time of the execution of P2. Illiyas is also

a witness to the lease agreement. As the learned District Judge inter alia

has stated in the judgment, in the year 1988, a sum of Rs. 100,000 is a

substantial amount and if possession was not handed over to the 1st

defendant, she would not have waited until 2003 to recover that money.

There is not even a police complaint alleging that possession was not

handed over to her upon the execution of the lease agreement.

Conversely, the plaintiff made a police complaint dated 18.09.1992

marked P14 (17 days after the effluxion of the lease agreement) stating

that the defendants are not vacating the premises.

The 1st defendant is the elder sister of the 2nd defendant. The 2nd

defendant is also in possession of the premises. It is the complaint of the

plaintiff that the 1st defendant sublet or allowed the 2nd defendant also to

conduct the business in the premises in violation of clause 5 of the lease

agreement. It is the 2nd defendant who contested the plaintiffs case. The

2nd defendant took up the position in the answer that he became a co-

owner of the land by purchasing 1/45 share of the land including

premises No. 13 from another person by deed marked 2V1 dated

16.08.1990 and therefore without first filing a partition action to end the

co-ownership, the plaintiff cannot maintain this action.

5

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

After trial, the learned District Judge entered judgment for the plaintiff

except the relief for declaration of title.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court and dismissed the plaintiffs action on the basis that the

plaintiff filed the action as the sole owner of the property but the 2nd

defendant is a co-owner of the property and therefore the 2nd defendant

cannot be ejected from the property. In addition, the High Court

concluded that the plaintiffs cause of action is prescribed since the

plaintiff filed the action 6 years after the termination of the lease

agreement.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeal mainly on three questions of law:

(a) Is the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal contrary to law,

more specifically, section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance?

(b) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal misdirect itself in law by failing

to understand the real nature of the dispute presented for

adjudication?

(c) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in holding that the

cause of action of the plaintiff is prescribed in law?

Can the plaintiffs action be dismissed on the basis that the 2nd

defendant is a co-owner of the land?

The learned District Judge accepted the evidence of the plaintiff that at

the time of the execution of the lease agreement, the possession of the

premises was handed over to the 1st defendant in the presence of the 2nd

defendant who is the brother of the 1st defendant and their father. The

High Court does not dispute this finding of fact by the trial Judge.

6

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

The 2nd defendant came into possession of the premises under the 1st

defendant lessee, his elder sister. The 2nd defendant does not have

independent survival in the premises. He will have to shelter behind the

protection of her sister. Every subordinate interest must perish with the

superior interest on which it is dependent.

What does section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance enact?

No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such

tenant, shall during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to

deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the beginning of the

tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and no person who

came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in

possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had

a title to such possession at the time when such licence was given.

The lessee cannot question the lessors right, title or interest in the

premises for the latter to lease it out to him. The reason being that a

person need not necessarily be the owner of the premises to enter into

such an agreement with another. Even in the absence of ownership, these

agreements establish valid legal relationships such as landlord and

tenant, lessor and lessee, licensor and licensee between the parties,

although they may not be binding on the actual owner. (Professor George

Wille, Landlord and Tenant in South Africa, 4th Edition, page 20; Dr. H.W.

Tambiah, Landlord and Tenant in Ceylon, page 48; Imbuldeniya v. De

Silva [1987] 1 Sri LR 367 at 372, 380, Gunasekera v. Jinadasa [1996] 2

Sri LR 115 at 120; Pinona v. Dewanarayana [2004] 2 Sri LR 11)

In Ruberu v. Wijesooriya [1998] 1 Sri LR 58 at 60, Gunawardana J. held:

Whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is foreign to

a suit in ejectment against either. The licensee (the defendant-

respondent) obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it upon the

7

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

terms that he will not dispute the title of him, i.e. the plaintiff-

appellant without whose permission, he (the defendant-respondent)

would not have got it. The effect of the operation of section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title

under which he is in occupation he must, first, quit the land. The fact

that the licensee or the lessee obtained possession from the plaintiff-

appellant is perforce an admission of the fact that the title resides in

the plaintiff. No question of title can possibly arise on the pleadings

in this case, because, as the defendant-respondent has stated in his

answer that he is a lessee under the plaintiff-appellant, he is

estopped from denying the title of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an

inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will ever be permitted

either to question the title of the person who gave him the lease or

the licence or the permission to occupy or possess the land or to set

up want of title in that person, i.e. of the person who gave the licence

or the lease. That being so, it is superfluous, in this action, framed

as it is on the basis that the defendant-respondent is a licensee, to

seek a declaration of title.

In the case of Reginald Fernando v. Pubilinahamy [2005] 1 Sri LR 31 the

Supreme Court declared:

Where the plaintiff (licensor) established that the defendant was a

licensee, the plaintiff is entitled to take steps for ejectment of the

defendant whether or not the plaintiff was the owner of the land.

Gunasinghe v. Samarasundara [2004] 3 Sri LR 28 and Dharmasiri v.

Wickrematunga [2002] 2 Sri LR 218 are also cases that share the same

view.

The 2nd defendant cannot defeat the plaintiffs action on the basis that

the plaintiff does not have absolute title to the premises No. 13. The

8

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

plaintiff need not prove title to the land for the ejectment of the defendant.

The title is presumed to be with the plaintiff. Once the Court decides that

the defendant is a lessee or licensee of the plaintiff, whether the plaintiff

is the owner of the entire premises or part of it or has no title at all to the

premises is irrelevant.

The High Court misdirected itself about the whole case. The High Court

did not refer to any of these legal principles. The High Court did not

understand the case presented by the plaintiff before the District Court.

It decided the appeal on the basis that the 2nd defendant is a co-owner of

the land and therefore he cannot be ejected from the premises in suit by

the plaintiff who is also a co-owner. The High Court concluded:

On the other hand it is significant to note that the Plaintiff has come

before court alleging that the 2nd Defendant is in unlawful

possession and it seems that no contractual relationship whatsoever

between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant. The learned counsel for

the Plaintiff contended that the 2nd Defendant should have

surrendered the possession of the premises in suit and litigated

before a competent court thereafter. However, as discussed earlier

the 2nd Defendant cannot be treated as a lessee of the Plaintiff in

eyes of law and he claimed to be another co-owner of the property.

It is to be born in mind that the Plaintiff is evidently a co-owner of

the property and he is not entitled to have a declaration of title as

prayed for due to the reasons already discussed. Therefore it is my

opinion that the learned District Judge erred in concluding that the

Plaintiff is entitled to eject the 2nd Defendant who claimed to be

another co-owner of the property in suit.

As I have explained below, the plaintiff did not file the action as the owner

or a co-owner of the premises. In any event, the 2nd defendant did not

prove that he is a co-owner of the land. He tendered a deed marked 2V1

9

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

alleged to have been executed on 16.08.1990, which is during the

operation of the lease agreement. It is not even a photocopy of the original

deed. It is not a registered deed at the Land Registry. By way of issues,

the position taken up by the 2nd defendant was not that he is a co-owner

of the land but that he is the owner of premises No. 13 by deed 2V1 (vide

issue No. 26).

The plaintiffs action is neither a rei vindicatio nor a declaration of

title, but rather, an action for ejectment

The plaintiffs action is not a rei vindicatio action. Although the plaintiff

sought a declaration of title to the premises in suit in addition to the

ejectment of the defendants, what the plaintiff filed was an action for

ejectment based on the violation of the lease agreement. In an ejectment

action, the plaintiff must show a present right to possession of the

property withheld by the defendant. In cases where a plaintiff files an

action for ejectment on a breach of agreement, as in this instance, there

is no legal requirement to seek a declaration of title to the premises in

suit, although it is done as a matter of practice. If a declaration of title is

sought in such action, the Court can grant that relief against the

defendant not because the plaintiff has proved title to the premises but

because the defendant is debarred from disputing the plaintiffs title by

operation of law. This was lucidly explained by Gratiaen J. in Pathirana

v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172-173:

In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery

of the property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful

occupation. The plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the very

essence of the action. Maasdorps Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96.

10

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

The scope of an action by a lessor against an overholding lessee for

restoration and ejectment, however, is different. Privity of contract

(whether it be by original agreement or by attornment) is the

foundation of the right to relief and issues as to title are irrelevant to

the proceedings. Indeed, a lessee who has entered into occupation

is precluded from disputing his lessors title until he has first

restored the property in fulfilment of his contractual obligation. The

lessee (conductor) cannot plead the exceptio dominii, although he

may be able easily to prove his own ownership, but he must by all

means first surrender his possession and then litigate as to

proprietorship Voet 19.2.32.

Both these forms of action referred to are no doubt designed to

secure the same primary relief, namely, the recovery of property. But

the cause of action in one case is the violation of the plaintiffs rights

of ownership, in the other it is the breach of the lessees contractual

obligation.

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way

of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in

truth an action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding

tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the

declaration is based on proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of

the contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the lessor is

the true owner.

Hence the High Court was wrong to have looked at the appeal on the

basis that the plaintiff has filed this action based on his title and no more.

The nature of the plaintiffs action is clear by the following observation

made by the learned High Court Judge himself in the impugned

judgement: A perusal of the plaint it is clear that albeit the present action

is in the nature of a declaration of title no chain of title was set out in the

11

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

plaint other than simply referring to a single title deed upon which he said

to have derived title to the premises in suit.

Can a defendant who enters into a land in a subordinate character

claim title to the land in the same action?

According to Roman Dutch Law principles, a defendant who enters into

a land in a subordinate character such as a lessee, licensee, tenant,

mortgagee etc. cannot claim ownership to the land in the same action. To

assert ownership, he must first quit the land and then fight for his rights.

Voet 19.2.32 as translated in Selective Voets commentary on the

Pandects Vol 3, Percival Gane tr, Butterworth & Co. (Africa) Ltd (1956)

447 states:

Lessee cannot dispute lessors title, tho third party can. Nor can the

setting up of an exception of ownership by the lessee stay this

restoration of the property leased, even though perhaps the proof of

ownership would be easy for the lessee. He ought in every event to

give back the possession first, and then litigate about the

proprietorship.

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 173, Gratiaen J.

endorsed this view.

Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law, Vol III (C.G. Hall ed, 8th edn,

Juta and Co. 1970) 185 states:

A lessee, as already stated, is not entitled to dispute his landlords

title, and consequently he cannot refuse to give up possession of the

property at the termination of his lease on the ground that he is

himself the rightful owner of it. His duty in such a case is first to

restore the property to the lessor and then to bring an action for a

declaration of rights.

12

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In Alvar Pillai v. Karuppan (1899) 4 NLR 321, the plaintiff sued the

defendant to recover possession of the entire land on the basis that the

term of lease had expired. The defendant refused to give up possession of

the whole land on the basis that he was the tenant under the plaintiff

only for a half of the said land. He set up a title under another person to

the other half. Although the defendant was initially placed in possession

by the plaintiff on the whole land, the District Judge entered judgment

for the plaintiff only for his half share. On appeal, Bonser C.J. stated at

322:

Now, it appears that the plaintiff can only prove title to a half of the

land. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to state the

devolution of the title, for even though the ownership of one-half of

this land were in the defendant himself, it would seem that by our

law, having been let into possession of the whole by the plaintiff, it

is not open to him to refuse to give up possession to his lessor at the

expiration of his lease. He must first give up possession, and then it

will be open to him to litigate about the ownership (see Voet XIX. 2.

32).

In Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne [1997] 1 Sri LR 197 the Court espoused

a similar viewpoint.

In the Supreme Court case of Wimala Perera v. Kalyani Sriyalatha [2011]

1 Sri LR 182 it was held:

A lessee is not entitled to dispute his landlords title by refusing to

give up possession of the property at the termination of his lease on

the ground that he acquired certain rights to the property subsequent

to him becoming the lessee and during the period of tenancy. He

must first give up possession and then litigate about the ownership

he alleges.

13

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In Bandara v. Piyasena (1974) 77 NLR 102 where facts were similar to

the facts of the instant appeal, the Supreme Court held as follows:

Learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned District

Judge has clearly held that the house in the premises in suit was

the house taken by the defendant on the lease bond P4 of 5.12.1960.

The question does arise as to whether the plaintiff can maintain this

action for ejectment of the defendant. The defendant has sought to

resist the claim of the plaintiff on the footing of certain interests in

this land which he has acquired on a deed of 10.5.1962 during the

period of the lease. The District Judge observes that as the

defendant is a co-owner of this land, the plaintiff is not entitled to

maintain this action against the defendant for a declaration of title

to a building put up by him in the common property.

Dr. Wickremesinghe has drawn our attention to Maasdorp Book III

page 216, where he observes that a lessee is not entitled to dispute

his landlords title and consequently he cannot refuse to give up

possession of the property at the termination of his lease on the

ground that he is himself the rightful owner of the said property. His

duty in such a case is first to restore the property to the lessor and

then litigate with him as to the ownership. (See also Voet 19 Tit. 2

Section 32) where it has been set out that the setting up of any

defence of ownership of the lessee cannot stay the restoration of the

property leased, even though, perhaps, the proof of ownership

cannot be easy for the lessee. He ought in every event to give back

possession first and then litigate about the proprietorship.

In the light of these principles which are not questioned by Mr.

Amerasinghe, learned Counsel for the respondent, we are of the

view that there is a merit in the submissions made by Dr.

Wickremesinghe that the District Judge was in error in holding that

14

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

the plaintiff cannot maintain this action against the defendant, since

the defendant had acquired certain rights on 10.5.1962 subsequent

to his becoming a lessee and during the period of the lease.

We would accordingly enter judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for.

The plaintiff shall be entitled to the costs of action and of this appeal.

The High Court states the 2nd defendant cannot be treated as a lessee of

the plaintiff in the eyes of the law and he claimed to be another co-owner

of the property. I accept that the 2nd defendant cannot be treated as a

lessee of the plaintiff. But as I stated previously the 2nd defendant comes

under the original lessee, the 1st defendant. With the eviction of the 1st

defendant, her subordinates, agents, servants etc. should all leave. The

normal rule is that the branch falls with the tree; ending of the 1st

defendants standing in the premises would also have the effect of ending

that of her subordinates. The 2nd defendant cannot create a purported

ownership or co-ownership during the subsistence of the lease agreement

and thwart the action of the plaintiff.

For the sake of completeness, it is worth noting that if an action is filed

for ejectment against such defendant who originally entered into

possession in a subordinate character, and such defendant claims

prescriptive title to the property (which is an arduous task) by stating

that he changed the character of possession from subordinate to adverse

by an overt act (as the starting point of adverse possession) and

continued such adverse possession for over 10 years as required by

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, the rigidity of the said principle

can be relaxed. In such circumstances, the defendant is not compelled to

surrender possession as a prerequisite for establishing his prescriptive

title.

15

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

Professor G.L. Peiris in his book Law of Property in Sri Lanka, Vol I, (2nd

edn, 1983) 112, citing inter alia Angohamy v. Appoo (Morgans Digest

281), Government Agent, Western Province v. Perera (1908) 11 NLR 337,

and Alwis v. Perera (1919) 21 NLR 321 states:

The principle that an occupation which began in a dependent or

subordinate capacity can be converted into adverse possession by

an overt act or a series of acts indicative of a challenge to the owners

title, is clearly deducible from the decided cases.

The presumption is that a person who commences his possession in a

subordinate character continues such possession in that character. To

demonstrate a shift from one character to another, cogent and affirmative

evidence is required.

In Ran Naide v. Punchi Banda (1930) 31 NLR 478, Jayawardene A.J.

observed:

Where a person who has obtained possession of a land of another

in a subordinate character, as for example as a tenant or mortgagee,

seeks to utilize that possession as the foundation of a title by

prescription, he must show that by some overt act known to the

person under whom he possesses he has got rid of that subordinate

possession and commenced to use and occupy the property ut

dominus (Government Agent v. Ismail Lebbe (1908) 2 Weer. 29). It is

for him to show that his quasi-fiduciary position was changed by

some overt act of possession. This view was adopted by the Privy

Council in Naguda Marikar v. Mohamadu (1903) 7 N.L.R. 91) and

also by the Supreme Court in Orloff v. Grebe (1907) 10 N.L.R. 183).

In Seeman v. David [2000] 3 Sri LR 23 at 26, Weerasuriya J. stated:

16

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

It is well settled law that a person who entered property in a

subordinate character cannot claim prescriptive rights till he changes

his character by an overt act. He is not entitled to do so by forming

a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of ouster. The proof of

adverse possession is a condition precedent to the claim for

prescriptive rights.

The same conclusion was reached in Thillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21

NLR 12 at 19 and Mitrapala v. Tikonis Singho [2005] 1 Sri LR 206 at 211-

212.

In the case of De Soysa v. Fonseka (1957) 58 NLR 501 at 502, Basnayake

C.J. held:

There is no evidence that the user which commenced with the leave

and licence of the owner of No. 18 was at any time converted to an

adverse user. When a user commences with leave and licence the

presumption is that its continuance rests on the permission originally

granted. Clear and unmistakable evidence of the commencement of

an adverse user thereafter for the prescribed period is necessary to

entitle the claimant to a decree in his favour. There is no such

evidence in the instant case.

In the Privy Council case of Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva (1951) 52 NLR

289, it was held that If a person goes into possession of land as an agent

for another, prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest

that he is holding adversely to his principal.

In Naguda Marikar v. Mohammadu (1898) 7 NLR 91, the Privy Council

held that in the absence of any evidence to show that the plaintiff had got

rid of his character of agent, he was not entitled to the benefit of section

3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

17

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In the case of Navaratne v. Jayatunge (1943) 44 NLR 517, Howard C.J.

remarked:

The defendant entered into possession of the lands in dispute with

the consent and the permission of the owner. Being a licensee, she

cannot get rid of this character unless she does some overt act

showing an intention to possess adversely.

In the more recent case of Ameen and Another v. Ammavasi Ramu

(SC/APPEAL/232/2017, SC Minutes of 22.01.2019), one of the questions

to be decided was whether the defendant, who was a licensee, was

entitled to put forward a plea of prescription. De Abrew A.C.J. stated:

When a person starts possessing an immovable property with leave

and licence of the owner, the presumption is that he continues to

possess the immovable property on the permission originally granted

and such a person or his agents or heirs cannot claim prescriptive

title against the owner or his heirs on the basis of the period he

possessed the property.

Can a plea of prescription be raised for the first time on appeal?

The defendants in the answers did not take up the position that they have

acquired prescriptive title to the premises or that the cause of action of

the plaintiff is prescribed. Nor did they raise an issue to that effect.

However, on appeal before the High Court, counsel for the 2nd defendant

appears to have taken up the position that the plaintiffs cause of action

is prescribed. Although the judgment of the High Court in this regard is

not clear, it is clear that the High Court has accepted the argument on

prescription as another ground to allow the appeal. The High Court holds:

A simple reading of the plaint makes it clear that the Plaintiff has

filed this action based on his title and no more. In fact it is alleged

18

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

that the 1st Defendant is liable to be ejected as the lease agreement

has expired already but it seems as pointed out by the learned

counsel for the 2nd Defendant that if there was such cause of action

arose on such agreement it is prescribed as the present action was

filed in 2002 namely after 06 years. I am of the view that in the

absence of declaration of title in favour of the Plaintiff is not entitled

act upon such cause of action already prescribed.

Prescription can take the form of acquisitive prescription, serving as a

mode of acquiring title, or extinctive prescription, acting as a defence or

bar to prosecution. The plea of prescription to be sustained in law must

be taken up in the pleadings. It cannot be raised as an issue at the trial

without expressly pleaded in the answer, unless the plaintiff consents to

it. It cannot be raised as an issue while the trial is in progress. Needless

to say, it cannot be taken up for the first time in appeal.

The Prescription Ordinance only limits the time within which an action

may be instituted but it does not prohibit an action being instituted

outside the stipulated time limit. If the objection is not raised by the

opposite party in the pleadings, the opposite party is deemed to have

waived it and acquiesced in the action being tried on the merits.

The judge cannot take up the plea of prescription ex mero motu because

a party can waive such objection. Chitty on Contract, Vol I, 33rd edn, para

28-108 states A party is not bound to rely on limitation as a defence if he

does not wish to do so. In general, the court will not raise the point suo

officio even if it appears from the face of the pleading that the relevant

period of limitation has expired. Chitty at para 28-127 states Limitation

is a procedural matter, and not one of substance.

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In Juanis Appuhamy v. Juan Silva (1908) 11 NLR 157, Hutchnson C.J.

and Wood Renton J. (later C.J.) state that it is competent for a party to

waive a claim by prescription.

It is not obnoxious to law or public policy for parties to agree not to plead

prescription (Hatton National Bank Ltd v. Helenluc Garments Ltd [1999] 2

Sri LR 365). Chitty (ibid) dealing with the English Law states at para 28-

109 An express or implied agreement not to plead the statute, whether

made before or after the limitation period has expired, is valid if supported

by consideration (or made by deed) and will be given effect to by the Court.

Prof. C.G. Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts, Vol II, para 844, states:

It is not contrary to public policy for parties to enter into an agreement not

to plead limitation. Such an agreement is valid and enforceable in English

Law if supported by consideration, whether it be made before or after the

limitation period has expired. The same observation holds good for our law,

except that such an agreement need not be supported by consideration.

In Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekere (1948) 50 NLR 253 at 255

Basnayake J. (later C.J.) held:

An attempt was made to argue that the defendants claim was

barred by the Prescription Ordinance (Cap. 55). The plea is not taken

in the plaintiffs replication. There is no issue on the point, nor is

there any evidence touching it. The plaintiff was represented by

counsel throughout the trial. In these circumstances the plaintiff is

not entitled to raise the question at this stage. It is settled law that

when, as in the case of sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the

Prescription Ordinance, the effect of the statute is merely to limit the

time in which an action may be brought and not to extinguish the

right, the court will not take the statute into account unless it is

specially pleaded by way of defence.

20

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In Gnananathan v. Premawardena [1999] 3 Sri LR 301, the defence taken

in issue Nos. 7-9 was based on section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance.

These issues on prescription were raised after the commencement of the

trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal took the view that the District Judge

should not have accepted those issues as the defendant did not plead

such defence in the answer. Justice Weerasekera at 309-310 states:

Presumably, the defence taken in the issue is based on section 10 of

the Prescription Ordinance. The acts of nuisance complained of are

thus sought to be shown to have taken place long prior to the 3-year

period. To that the plaintiff-appellants answer is that the application

of the defendant-respondent to the National Housing Department for

the premises to purchase was finally concluded only 2 months

before the institution of the action.

Be that as it may the position in law is quite clear and settled. In the

case of Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekera 50 NLR 253 Basnayake

J. held: Where the effect of the Prescription Ordinance is merely to

limit the time within which an action may be brought, the Court will

not take the statute into account unless it is expressly pleaded by

way of defence.

It is, therefore, settled law and that for salutary reasons lest all the

basic rules of law particularly that of the rule of audi alteram partem

that if a party to an action intends to raise the plea of prescription it

is obligatory on his part to plead that in his pleadings. I say salutary

because reason, justice and fair play demands that the opposing

party be given an opportunity of making such a plea and that party

or no party should not be taken unawares of a defence taken that

the action is barred by lapse of time.

21

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

In this action the answer did not state that the cause of action was

prescribed in law. For the first time this defence was permitted after

the commencement of the evidence. A practice which in my view is

both repugnant to law, reasonableness and fair play and from which

judges should desist. In any event the defendant-respondent has

denied all the acts of nuisance acts pleaded, but also for some

inexplicable reason pleaded non-deterioration. Therefore, a plea of

prescription cannot arise without the act or acts of nuisance being

admitted whereas the defendant-respondent has in his answer

specifically denied them. The plea is, therefore, not only in law, but

also at the stage it was so done, both bad in law, but also

contradictory in itself.

The acceptation of these issues is also repugnant to the law

inasmuch as the date of commencement of prescription is vague in

that the absence of a plea as to whether it was the acts of nuisance

or the date of the notice to quit. It is, therefore, additionally for the

same reason of reasonableness that as is required by section 44 of

the Civil Procedure Code that a plea of the reasons for the non-

operation or application of prescription is mandatory that it is equally

reasonable and fair that the law requires that the defence of

prescription be specifically pleaded in the answer.

I am, therefore, of the view that issues 7, 8 and 9 should not have

been accepted as issues for adjudication and that the order

accepting them is bad, insupportable and made per incuriam. I,

therefore, reject them.

In the Supreme Court case of Tilakaratne v. Chandrasiri and Another

(SC/APPEAL/172/2013, SC Minutes of 27.01.2017), prescription was

not pleaded as a defence in the answer, no issue regarding prescription

was framed at the trial and there was no suggestion made at the trial that

22

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

the plaintiffs action was prescribed. However, at the hearing of the

appeal before the High Court, counsel for the defendants submitted that

the plaintiffs action was one for Goods Sold and Delivered which, by

operation of section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance, was prescribed after

the expiry of one year from the date of the last sale which took place on

30th March 2005 as per the entries in a notebook marked P2. The High

Court accepted this argument and dismissed the plaintiffs action.

Prasanna Jayawardena J. held that the defendant could not have taken

up the defence of prescription for the first time in appeal.

[I]t is settled Law that, a party is prohibited from raising an issue

regarding prescription for the first time in appeal. As Bonser C.J.

described in the early case of TERUNNANSE vs. MENIKE [1 NLR 200

at p.202], a defence of prescription is a shield and not a weapon

of offence. Adopting the phraseology used by the learned Chief

Justice over a century ago, it may be said that, if a Defendant

chooses not to pick up the shield of prescription when he goes into

battle at the trial, the rules of combat are that he forfeits the use of

that shield in appeal.

In the instant case, the High Court erred when it decided on appeal that

the plaintiffs action is prescribed.

Conclusion

I answer the three questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted

in the affirmative. The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is set

aside and the judgment of the District Court is restored. The appeal is

allowed.

The subject matter of this action is business premises. The defendants

refused to hand over possession of the premises after the expiry of the

lease agreement for more than 20 years. Apart from other reliefs the

23

SC/APPEAL/225/2014

plaintiff is entitled to have with the appeal being allowed, the 1st and 2nd

defendants each shall pay Rs. 250,000 to the plaintiff (in total Rs.

500,000) as costs of this Court in addition to the payment of incurred

costs in the trial Court and the High Court.
