"the bank cannot recover more than what is due to the bank by selling a mortgaged property. In"
"fact, the bank cannot recover more than what is stated in the resolution passed by the board."
"Further, Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (3rd edition), Volume 3 at page"
"262 defines the word ‘sale’ as “undoubtably, in general, implies an exchange for money…”."
"Further, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th Edition) at page 1603 defines ‘sale’ as “the transfer or"
"property or title for a price.” Furthermore, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of"
"the English Language Unabridged defines the word ‘resale’ as “1. the act of selling again"
"usually to the next link in a chain of distribution, 2. a sale at second hand, 3.an additional sale"
"to  the  same  buyer.”  A  careful  analysis  of  the  interpretations  given  to  the  words  ‘sale’  and"
"‘resale’ show that the transfer of a property for consideration to a buyer."
"Section 20 of the said Ordinance has used the word ‘sell’. Further, in section 31 of the said"
"Ordinance, the legislature has used the word ‘resell’. However, section 27 of the Ordinance has"
"used  the  word  ‘sold’.  Therefore,  a  careful  analysis  of  the  words  ‘sell’  and  ‘resell’  used  in"
"sections  19  and  31  respectively  in  the  Bank  of  Ceylon  Ordinance  shows  that  a  different"
"meaning is not given to the word ‘sold’ in section 27 of the said Ordinance. Therefore, section"
"27 is applicable to both sections 20 and 31 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance."
"A careful consideration of the provisions of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance shows that the bank"
"is  not  authorised  by  the said  Ordinance  to  make  a  profit  by  selling the  mortgaged  property"
"purchased at a nominal price at a public auction. Further, it would result in unjust enrichment"
"to the bank as the market value of the mortgaged property is often much higher than the amount"
"of the loan obtained by mortgagors."
"In the aforementioned circumstance, I am of the view that the restrictive interpretation given"
"to section 27 of the Bank of Ceylon  Ordinance by the learned  Senior State Counsel  for the"
"respondent, based on the words “sale” and “resale”, is untenable. Thus, the bank retaining the"
"excess  money  of  the  proceeds  from  a  resale  of  the  mortgaged  property  to  a  third  party"
"contravenes the provisions of the said Ordinance. Particularly section 27 of the said Ordinance."
