"(hereinafter referred to as the “Bank of Ceylon Ordinance”) in refusing to refund the money"
"after  the  property  mortgaged  to  the  bank  was  re-sold  to  a  third  party.  Thus,  it  violated  his"
"Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"The petitioner stated that the Katukenda Trading Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as"
"the “borrowing company”), obtained a sum of Rs. 1,000,000 as a loan from the Wellawatte"
"branch of Bank of Ceylon (hereinafter referred to as the “bank”). As a security for the said"
"loan, the petitioner, being a director of the said borrowing company, mortgaged his personal"
"property  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “mortgaged  property”)  under  a  Mortgage  Bond  No."
"2636 dated 3rd of January, 2000 which was attested by Chandani Mathew, Notary Public. The"
"petitioner  stated  that  he  paid  a  sum  of  Rs.1,128,000/-  in  settlement  of  the  loan.  However,"
"despite  the  said  payments,  the  bank  exercised  the  powers  under  the  said  Ordinance  and"
"auctioned the said property. However, as there were no bidders at the said public auction, the"
"bank purchased the mortgaged property that was worth about Rs.17,500,000/- for only a sum"
"of Rs.1000/-."
"Furthermore, the petitioner stated that upon hearing that the bank was opting for a resale, he"
"introduced one of his relations to the bank in order to purchase the property under reference for"
"a sum of Rs. 12,500,000/- and to settle the mortgage. However, the former Assistant General"
"Manager of the Bank refused to sell the property to his relative and stated that being the new"
"owner of the mortgaged property, the Bank would decide to whom the property would be sold."
"Subsequently, the respondent bank is alleged to have sold the said property to a third-party on"
"the 2nd of October, 2009."
"The petitioner further stated that since the mortgaged property is worth about Rs.17,500,000/-"
"and the loan was obtained only for Rs. 1,000,000/-, he had requested the Chairman of the bank"
"to give him the details of the outstanding sum, the interests and other dues on the loan granted"
