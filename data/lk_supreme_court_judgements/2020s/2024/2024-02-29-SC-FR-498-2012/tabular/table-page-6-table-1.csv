"auction in terms of section 27 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance. Further, due to the absence of"
"a third party at the public auction, the mortgaged property was purchased by the bank in terms"
"of section 30(1) of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance."
"However, as  the property in  question had not  been purchased by a third  party at  the public"
"auction, the bank purchased the said  property at  a nominal  value  of Rs. 1,000/- in  terms  of"
"section 30(1) of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance. Thus, the petitioner in the instant application"
"cannot claim the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the property under section 27 of the"
"Bank of Ceylon Ordinance. It was further submitted that sections 27 and 31 of the Bank of"
"Ceylon Ordinance enable the bank to re-sell the property purchased by the bank to a third party."
"Furthermore, it was contended that in any event the bank is not under any obligation to pay the"
"balance of the proceeds to the petitioner, as at the time the property was sold the owner of the"
"said property was the bank and not the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner is not entitled to receive"
"the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the property in question, as there is no statutory or"
"legal requirement to pay the balance of the proceeds of the sale to the original borrower."
