After the filing of objections, both parties had agreed to conclude the inquiry by way of written submissions and the High Court had fixed the matter for judgment on the written submissions as agreed by the parties.

In relation to the stance taken up by the Petitioner in its written submissions dated 19.12.2018, it has brought this Courts attention to section 28 of the National Insurance Trust Fund Act No.28 of 2006 which established the said NITF, and the said section further states that benefits from the Fund shall be paid to persons to whom the said Act applies, and such monies as are specified in section 18 of the Act shall be paid to the Fund. It must be noted here that the said Act was passed in 2006 while the relevant Insurance Policies were obtained in 1998. However, as per the aforementioned section 18(c), all monies lying to the credit of the Strike, Riot and Civil Commotion and Terrorism Fund established in terms of the Cabinet Decision of November 18th, 1987 in Accounts in Peoples Bank, Union Place and Bank of Ceylon, Corporate Branch should be paid into the NITF. This provision apparently indicates that the NITF has absorbed the Government Terrorism Fund referred to in the Terrorism Endorsement in the Insurance Policies. The Petitioner has further referred to certain regulations made by the Minister in charge of the subject in terms of section 28 (2)(c) of the said Act published in the Gazette Number 1542/11 dated 25th March 2008. However, those provisions that came into existence after the Petitioner and the Respondent entered into the contract of insurance as found in the relevant insurance policies cannot establish a contractual nexus between the Respondent and the Government Terrorism Fund or NITF.",

Thus, the Petitioner submits that no dispute can ever arise and/or has arisen between the Petitioner and the Respondent which is subject to the arbitration agreement contained in the contract of insurance. In this regard, the Petitioner brought this Courts attention to the evidence of the Respondent where during cross examination the Respondent admitted the liability of the NITF to pay what is covered under the said endorsement. The Petitioner has also referred to some communications between the Petitioner and the Respondent where it is either mentioned that the Petitioner would be presenting the claim to the NITF or that the claim was rejected by the NITF. Hence, the Petitioner states that the Respondent was aware of the involvement of the NITF and has conceded that the dispute is with the NITF. The Petitioner, therefore, argues that there is no dispute between the Petitioner and the Respondent that would fall within the terms of submission to arbitration as required by section 32(1)(a)(iii) of the Arbitration Act.

As per the notices of Arbitration, each reference for Arbitration has been done in term of Clause 8 of the General Exceptions in the relevant policies. Such reference was based on disclaiming of liability in respect of insurance claims made under the relevant policies. Said Clause 8 provides for the parties to the relevant policy to refer all differences arising out of the relevant policy for arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. When it refers to all differences, it encompasses any dispute that is arisen out of the contract of insurance. Thus, there is an arbitration agreement between the parties to the relevant insurance policy as far as each policy is concerned. It should be noted that neither any person from any authority which was responsible for the Government Terrorism Fund or later the NITF (once it came into existence in terms of the Act No. 28 of 2006) had taken part in signing the policies for them to become a party to the policy. It is also common ground that the Petitioner collected the relevant premiums from the Respondent including the premiums for the protection under the Terrorism Endorsement which endorsement became part of each relevant policy. If one looks at the relevant Terrorism Endorsement quoted above, it is clear that the said extension is granted by the Petitioner for and on behalf of the Government Terrorism Fund.

    "text": "for the enforcement of obligation. As per the submissions made, originally, the Government Terrorism Fund was established through a decision of a Cabinet meeting. Thus, such a Fund cannot be considered as a legal person. The Terrorism Endorsement in the policy quoted above does not refer to any authority or legal person who is responsible for the Fund. The NITF Act which came into existence in 2006 has established a Board which is a corporate body for administration of the NITF. However, there is no such Board referred to in the said Government Terrorism Fund Endorsement found in the Policies. Hence, if it is an agency, there is no disclosure of any principal who should be liable relating to Terrorism Endorsement in the policy. Thus, as per the material placed, there is nothing to show that there was a contractual nexus creating obligations between the Respondent and the said Government Terrorism Fund or NITF or any authority responsible for such Fund. Each relevant insurance policy was between the Petitioner and the Respondent, and it is the Petitioner who granted the terrorism cover on behalf of the said Fund. Further, in my view it is the Petitioners responsibility and obligations that devolve on the Fund. The Respondent is not a party to any contract, agreement or arrangement between the Fund or any authority responsible for the Fund. Thus, in my view, it is the responsibility of the Petitioner to fulfill its obligations through the Fund as per any arrangements it has with the Fund. However, there is no contractual nexus between the Fund and the Respondent. As per each Policy of Insurance, the contract is between the Petitioner and the Respondent. Thus, the Arbitration agreement contained therein is between the Petitioner and the Respondent. As stated in the Majority decision of the Arbitration award, there is no provision found in the policies that allows the then Government Terrorism Fund to refuse payment on the basis that the relevant vehicles were not in the care, custody and the control of the Respondent. As a party to the contract of insurance, when the insurer refuses the claim on the basis that the NITF refused payment, there is a clear dispute with regard to the payment of claim arising out of the relevant policy of insurance, especially in terms of the Terrorism Endorsement. As explained above, parties to each relevant policy are the Petitioner and the Respondent and there is no contractual nexus proved between the Petitioner and the NITF. It is not in dispute that the premiums relevant to each policy including the amount relevant to the Terrorism Endorsement were collected by the Petitioner and as per some arrangement between the Petitioner and the Government Terrorism Fund, the Petitioner would have transmitted the relevant amounts to the said Fund or the NITF. Due to this arrangement, parties would have stated in the Terrorism Endorsement that the liability arising out of terrorism related damages or loss covered by the insurance policy devolves on the said Fund. However, to claim it from the Fund, there is no contractual relationship between the Respondent and the Terrorism Fund or the NITF. The contract of insurance that contained an arbitration agreement was between the Petitioner and the Respondent and, the dispute with the refusal of the claim has arisen from that agreement. Further, there is an arbitration agreement to refer all differences arising out of the policy for arbitration. The words All differences is a very wide term that include any dispute arising out of the relevant insurance policy. For the reasons given above, I am unable to agree with the submissions of the Petitioner that there could be no dispute between the Petitioner and the Respondent, on the basis that the liability for any claim arising out of the terrorism cover is determined and borne by the NITF",

If there is any liability to devolve on the NITF as per any arrangement between the Petitioner and the NITF or the then Government Terrorism Fund, it is the Petitioners liability arising out of the contract of insurance between the Petitioner as the insured and the Respondent as the insurer and nothing else. As per the Terrorism Endorsement quoted above, when the Fund alleges that by reason of the provisions of this extension any loss or damage is not covered by this insurance, the burden of proving such loss or damage is covered, is upon the insured. The reason that appeared to have been given by the NITF was that the vehicles were not in the care, custody and control of the Respondent. No such ground is found in the relevant policies to absolve the insurer or the Fund from liability. As such, there is nothing to be proven by the Respondent against such refusal after proving that the harm, damage or loss caused was due to the terrorist activities that existed at the relevant time. On the other hand, when there is a war, terrorist activities or natural disasters it is natural to expect that the insured may leave behind the insured property. Moreover, the decision on facts is solely with the Arbitrators and the learned High Court Judge is not expected to sit in appeal against the findings of facts by the Arbitrators. As explained above, the contract of insurance was between the Petitioner and the Respondent. There was no contractual nexus between the Respondent and the Government Terrorism Fund or the NITF and or any authority that was responsible for such Fund. The dispute has arisen from the contract of insurance due to the refusal to pay the claim after collecting the premium for Terrorism Endorsement. Whether the Petitioner is liable or not as per the contract of insurance itself is a part of the dispute. There was an arbitration agreement as explained above to refer all differences arising out of the contract of insurance found in the policy to refer for arbitration. Thus, the Arbitrators had the jurisdiction to hear and decide the dispute. In my view, the Majority award dealt with a dispute contemplated by or falling within the terms of submission for arbitration and contains decisions on matters within the scope of the submission to arbitration. As this was to enforce an award made in Sri Lanka, to set aside, it must fall within the ambit of section 32 (1) (a)(i) or(ii) or (iii) or(iv) or (b)(i) or (ii) of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995. Other than that, the High Court is not empowered to sit in appeal over the decision of the Arbitrators. No such ground as contemplated by the said section has been established before the High Court. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the following decision made by our superior courts. Light Weight Body Armour Ltd. Vs. Sri Lanka Army (2007) 1 Sri L R 411 In exercising jurisdiction under section 32 Court cannot sit in appeal over the conclusions of the Arbitral Tribunal by scrutinizing and reappreciating the evidence considered by the Arbitral Tribunal. The Court cannot re-examine the mental process of the Arbitration Tribunal contemplated in its findings nor can it revisit the reasonableness of the deductions given by the Arbitrator- since the arbitral tribunal is the sole judge of the quantity and the quality of the mass of evidence led before it by the parties Section 32 contains the sole grounds upon which an award may be challenged or set aside, courts have no jurisdiction to correct patent and glaring errors of law in an Award unless the",
