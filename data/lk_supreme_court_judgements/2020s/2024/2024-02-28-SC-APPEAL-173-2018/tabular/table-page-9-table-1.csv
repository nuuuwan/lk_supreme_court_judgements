"arising out of contract of insurance or that the alleged disputes are not covered by the arbitration"
"agreement.  If there is any liability to devolve on the NITF as per any arrangement between the"
"Petitioner and the NITF or the then Government Terrorism Fund, it is the Petitionerâ€™s liability"
"arising out of the contract of insurance between the Petitioner as the insured and the Respondent"
"as the insurer and nothing else."
"As per the Terrorism Endorsement quoted above, when the Fund alleges that by reason of the"
"provisions of this extension any loss or damage is not covered by this insurance, the burden of"
"proving such loss or damage is covered, is upon the insured. The reason that appeared to have"
"been given by the NITF was that the vehicles were not in the care, custody and control of the"
"Respondent. No such ground is found in the relevant policies to absolve the insurer or the Fund"
"from liability. As such, there is nothing to be proven by the Respondent against such refusal"
"after proving that the harm, damage or loss caused was due to the terrorist activities that existed"
"at  the  relevant  time.  On  the  other  hand,  when  there  is  a  war,  terrorist  activities  or  natural"
"disasters  it  is  natural  to  expect  that  the  insured  may  leave  behind  the  insured  property."
"Moreover, the decision on facts is solely with the Arbitrators and the learned High Court Judge"
"is not expected to sit in appeal against the findings of facts by the Arbitrators."
"A
s explained above, the contract of insurance was between the Petitioner and the Respondent."
"There was no contractual nexus between the Respondent and the Government Terrorism Fund"
"or the NITF and or any authority that was responsible for such Fund. The dispute has arisen"
"from the contract of insurance due to the refusal to pay the claim after collecting the premium"
"for  Terrorism  Endorsement.  Whether  the  Petitioner  is  liable  or  not  as  per  the  contract  of"
"insurance itself is a part of the dispute. There was an arbitration agreement as explained above"
"to refer all differences arising out of the contract of insurance found in the policy to refer for"
"arbitration.  Thus,  the  Arbitrators  had  the  jurisdiction  to  hear  and  decide  the  dispute.  In  my"
"view, the Majority award dealt with a dispute contemplated by or falling within the terms of"
"submission for arbitration and contains decisions on matters within the scope of the submission"
"to  arbitration.  As  this  was  to  enforce  an  award made  in  Sri  Lanka,  to  set  aside,  it  must  fall"
"within the ambit of section 32 (1) (a)(i) or(ii) or (iii) or(iv) or (b)(i) or (ii) of the Arbitration"
"Act No. 11 of 1995. Other than that, the High Court is not empowered to sit in appeal over the"
"decision  of  the  Arbitrators.  No  such  ground  as  contemplated  by  the  said  section  has  been"
"established before the High Court. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the following decision"
"made by our superior courts."
