"between the Respondent and the NITF or the Government Terrorism Fund as alleged by the"
"Petitioner,  it  is  questionable  the  necessity  for  the  Petitioner  to  be  involved  in  claims  or"
"communications in that regard."
"As per the notices of Arbitration, each reference for Arbitration has been done in term of Clause"
"8 of the General Exceptions in the relevant policies. Such reference was based on disclaiming"
"of  liability  in  respect  of  insurance  claims  made  under  the  relevant  policies.  Said  Clause  8"
"provides for the parties to the relevant policy to refer all differences arising out of the relevant"
"policy for arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. When it refers to all differences, it"
"encompasses  any  dispute  that  is  arisen  out  of  the  contract  of  insurance.  Thus,  there  is  an"
"arbitration agreement between the parties to the relevant insurance policy as far as each policy"
"is concerned."
"I
t should be noted that neither any person from any authority which was responsible for the"
"Government Terrorism Fund or later the NITF (once it came into existence in terms of the Act"
"No. 28 of 2006) had taken part in signing the policies for them to become a party to the policy."
"It  is  also  common  ground  that  the  Petitioner  collected  the  relevant  premiums  from  the"
"Respondent including the premiums for the protection under the Terrorism Endorsement which"
"endorsement  became  part  of  each  relevant  policy.  If  one  looks  at  the  relevant  Terrorism"
"Endorsement quoted above, it is clear that the said extension is granted by the Petitioner for"
"and on behalf of the Government Terrorism Fund. This could have happened due to situations"
"such as;"
"A)  There  was  an  administrative  or  contractual  or  statutorily  established  or  supported"
"arrangement or agreement between the Petitioner and the relevant Authority that was"
"responsible  for  the  said  Fund  at  the  time  of  entering  into  the  Policies  without  any"
"involvement of the Respondent to grant such cover through the Petitioner. (However,"
"it is clear that NITF Act was passed only in 2006. No statute or regulation relevant to"
"the time of entering into the policies prior to 2006 has been brought to the notice of the"
"Court  other  than  stating  that  the  Government  Terrorism  Fund  was  established  by  a"
"Cabinet Decision)."
"B)  The Petitioner was acting as the Agent of the relevant Fund or the Authority responsible"
"for the said Government Terrorism Fund."
"Whatever  it  is,  it  appears  that  an  arrangement  has  been  made  in  a  manner  to  devolve  any"
"liability that may accrue to the Petitioner to the said Fund. If it is a separate arrangement or an"
"agreement between the Petitioner and the Fund or the relevant authority, as the Fund or the"
"relevant authority responsible is not a party to the relevant policy, the Respondent has to claim"
"and go after the Petitioner for any liability in terms of the insurance policy and claim it from"
"the  Petitioner.  If  Petitioner  is  liable  or  proved  liable  it  is  up  to  the  Petitioner  to  cause  the"
"settlement of claims through the Fund as per the agreement or arrangement between it and the"
"Fund or the Authority that is responsible for the Fund. The Respondent or the Claimant cannot"
"go  after  the  Fund  or  the  relevant  Authority  since  there  is  no  contractual  nexus  between  the"
"Claimant and the Fund or the relevant authority. Even if it is an undisclosed agency between"
"the Petitioner and the Government Terrorism Fund, the Respondent or the Claimant still has to"
"go  after  the  Petitioner  to  enforce  any  obligation.  It  is  only  when  a  disclosed  agency  exists"
"between the Petitioner and the said Fund, the Respondent can go after the disclosed principal"
