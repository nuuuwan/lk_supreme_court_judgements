"for the enforcement of obligation. As per the submissions made, originally, the Government"
"Terrorism Fund was established through a decision of a Cabinet meeting. Thus, such a Fund"
"cannot be considered as a legal person. The Terrorism Endorsement in the policy quoted above"
"does not refer to any authority or legal person who is responsible for the Fund. The NITF Act"
"which  came  into  existence  in  2006  has  established  a  Board  which  is  a  corporate  body  for"
"administration of the NITF. However, there is no such Board referred to in the said Government"
"Terrorism  Fund  Endorsement  found  in  the  Policies.  Hence,  if  it  is  an  agency,  there  is  no"
"disclosure  of  any  principal  who  should  be  liable  relating  to  Terrorism  Endorsement  in  the"
"policy. Thus, as per the material placed, there is nothing to show that there was a contractual"
"nexus creating obligations between the Respondent and the said Government Terrorism Fund"
"or  NITF  or  any  authority  responsible  for  such  Fund.  Each  relevant  insurance  policy  was"
"between the Petitioner and the Respondent, and it is the Petitioner who granted the terrorism"
"cover on behalf of the said Fund. Further, in my view it is the Petitioner’s responsibility and"
"obligations that devolve on the Fund. The Respondent is not a party to any contract, agreement"
"or arrangement between the Fund or any authority responsible for the Fund. Thus, in my view,"
"it is the responsibility of the Petitioner to fulfill its obligations through the  Fund as per any"
"arrangements it has with the Fund. However, there is no contractual nexus between the Fund"
"and the Respondent. As per each Policy of Insurance, the contract is between the Petitioner and"
"the Respondent. Thus, the Arbitration agreement contained therein is between the Petitioner"
"and the Respondent."
"As stated in the Majority decision of the Arbitration award, there is no provision found in the"
"policies that allows the then Government Terrorism Fund to refuse payment on the basis that"
"the relevant vehicles were not in the care, custody and the control of the Respondent. As a party"
"to  the  contract  of  insurance,  when  the  insurer  refuses  the  claim  on  the  basis  that  the  NITF"
"refused payment, there is a clear dispute with regard to the payment of claim arising out of the"
"relevant policy of insurance, especially in terms of the Terrorism Endorsement. As explained"
"above,  parties  to  each  relevant  policy  are  the  Petitioner  and  the  Respondent  and  there  is  no"
"contractual  nexus  proved  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  NITF.  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the"
"premiums relevant to each policy including the amount relevant to the Terrorism Endorsement"
"were collected by the Petitioner and as per some arrangement between the Petitioner and the"
"Government Terrorism Fund, the Petitioner would have transmitted the relevant amounts to"
"the said Fund or the NITF. Due to this arrangement, parties would have stated in the Terrorism"
"Endorsement that the liability arising out of terrorism related damages or loss covered by the"
"insurance policy devolves on the said Fund. However, to claim it from the Fund, there is no"
"contractual relationship between the Respondent and the Terrorism Fund or the NITF."
"T
he contract of insurance that contained an arbitration agreement was between the Petitioner"
"and  the  Respondent  and,  the  dispute  with  the  refusal  of  the  claim  has  arisen  from  that"
"agreement. Further, there is an arbitration agreement to refer all differences arising out of the"
"policy for arbitration. The words “All differences” is a very wide term that include any dispute"
"arising out of the relevant insurance policy."
"F
or the reasons given above, I am unable to agree with the submissions of the Petitioner that"
"there  could  be  no  dispute  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  Respondent,  on  the  basis  that  the"
"liability for any claim arising out of the terrorism cover is determined and borne by the NITF"
