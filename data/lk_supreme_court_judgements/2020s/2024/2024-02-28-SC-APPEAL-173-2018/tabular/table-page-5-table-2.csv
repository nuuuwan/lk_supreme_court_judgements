"as directed by the Court, additional written submissions, dated 15.07.2020 and 03.06.2020 have"

he  Petitioner  attempts  to  indicate  that  there  is  a  jurisdictional  error  made  by  the  Arbitral"

"no liability on the Petitioner as the liability for any claim arising out of the terrorism cover is"
"determined and borne by the NITF. The Petitioner further argues that  the Arbitration award"
"deals with disputes not contemplated by and /or arising out of Contracts of Insurance, and thus,"
"falls beyond the scope of the submission to Arbitration or the alleged dispute is not covered by"
"the Arbitration agreement."

"“ … It is further declared and agreed that this extension is granted for and on behalf of the"

"that by reason of the provisions of this extension any loss or damage is not covered by this"
"insurance,  the  burden  or(sic)  proving  such  loss  or  damage  is  covered  shall  be  upon  the"
"insured…."
"It  is  hereby  declare(sic)  and  agreed  that  the  Riot  &  Strike  Extension  if  granted  for  and  on"
"behalf of the government fund for  Strike, Riot and Civil Commotion and Terrorism and any"
"liability whatsoever under this specific extension shall devolve solely upon the said fund.”"
