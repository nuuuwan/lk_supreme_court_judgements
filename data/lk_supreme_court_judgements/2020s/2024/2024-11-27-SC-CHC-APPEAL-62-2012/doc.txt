Janak De Silva, J.

The Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) applied to the Plaintiff-Respondent (Respondent)

for a housing loan. The housing loan application identified the property to be purchased

as 18/9, Chitra Lane, Colombo 05 (demised premises).

The Respondent by letter dated 23.05.2006 intimated its decision to offer the Appellant

a loan of Rs. 18,200,000/= or 80% of the market value, whichever is lower, repayable over

a period of 180 months at the interest rate of 13.90% which was to be reviewed annually.

This letter contained several terms and conditions of the loan.

The Appellant signed the letter of acceptance on 23.05.2006 itself and accepted the loan

subject to the terms and conditions of the letter dated 23.05.2006.

Page 3 of 37

The Respondent by letter of offer dated 05.06.2006 sent a more detailed letter setting

out the terms and conditions of the loan which was signed and accepted by the Appellant

on the same day.

Accordingly, a sum of Rs. 18,200,000/= was lent and advanced to the Appellant. The

Appellant used the loan proceeds and bought the demised premises from Jayawardena

Vidana Arachchige Lakshman Nalaka, who claimed to be seized and possessed and/or

otherwise well and sufficiently entitled to the demised property. It was signed on his

behalf by Vijith Sarath Kumara, who claimed to be the Attorney of Jayawardena Vidana

Arachchige Lakshman Nalaka. The Transfer Deed bearing No. 3135 dated 05.06.2006 was

attested by Mallikaratchige Dilrukshi Lalani Perera of the firm Julius & Creasy.

On the same day, the Appellant mortgaged the demised property to the Respondent as

security for the loan repayment by Primary Mortgage Bond No. 3136 dated 05.06.2006

(Mortgage Bond), attested by the said Mallikaratchige Dilrukshi Lalani Perera of the firm

Julius & Creasy.

The Appellant paid five loan instalments and defaulted afterwards. In this action, the

Respondent seeks to recover the amount due on the housing loan transaction. The

Appellant contends that good and valid title to the demised premises did not pass to him

resulting in the total failure of the consideration. Hence he asserts that nothing is due.

Furthermore, the Appellant has made a claim-in-reconvention in a sum of Rs. 50 million

for damages suffered due to breach of duty of care on the part of the Respondent.

The learned Commercial High Court judge entered judgment as prayed for in the plaint

and dismissed the claim-in-reconvention. The Appellant appeals.

There are two primary questions that arise for determination in this appeal. Firstly,

whether there has been a total failure of consideration of the housing loan. Secondly,

Page 4 of 37

whether the Respondent has any duty of care towards the Appellant and if so, whether it

was breached.

The Appellant has based his submissions on English law principles. Moreover, there is a

clear difference between the concepts of justa causa and consideration. Hence, the need

to first determine the applicable law.

Introduction of English Law

Although our common law is the Roman-Dutch law, English law has been introduced into

our legal system through legislation enacted by the British, express enactment that it will

apply in certain areas, enactment of local laws taken from an English Act and application

through judicial interpretation.

I shall examine only the introduction of English law in certain areas through express

enactment as it is sufficient to dispose of the questions which arise for determination in

this appeal.

English judges who were serving in Ceylon (as it was then known) were called upon to

apply Roman-Dutch law principles to the commercial disputes before them. This no doubt

was problematic as it was thought that some of the English judges had contempt for the

principles of Roman-Dutch law [Lee, article in the Journal of Comparative Legislation, N.S.

vol. vii, p. 237]. It brought about a mosaic of judicial precedent. Although at times, Roman-

Dutch law principles were applied without any reservation, there were instances when it

was refused due to the absence of a corresponding English law principle or was applied

with modifications thought fit by the judge.

Thus, in Boyd v. Staples [(1820-33) Ramanathans Reports 19 at 21] it was held that the

English statutory limitation is not the law of this Island, the Roman-Dutch law and the

regulations of the Government are guided in the administration of justice. On the contrary,

in Sedembranader v. Sangerapulle [(1843-1855) Ramanathans Reports 19)], decided in

Page 5 of 37

1845, Oliphant C.J. commented that the rule that interest might not be recovered in any

action in excess of the principle is unknown to the English law and refused to apply the

rule as there was no equity in it. Somewhat of a middle path was taken, in In Re the

application of Siva Pooniam for a writ of habeas corpus [(1820-33) Ramanathans

Reports 78 at 80] when it was held:

It has been always understood and this Court has always acted on the

understanding that the basis of law in this Island is the Dutch Roman law as

administered at the period of conquest in 1769, with such deviations, expedients

and useful alterations as, in the words of the character, shall be either absolutely

necessary and unavoidable, or evidentially beneficial and desirable.

The starting point for agitation for clarity and application of English law to commercial

disputes is the decision in Gerard and Brown v. Fulton [(1847-63) Ramanathans Reports

124] where Carl, J. was uncertain whether English law or Roman-Dutch law applied in

considering the days of grace permitted for the acceptance or payment of a bill of

exchange. Finally, he applied the principles of Roman-Dutch law but only after delaying

the judgment and consulting the Chief Justice.

The state of uncertainty of the law and the reasons for the introduction of English law to

commercial matters are succinctly explained by Tambiah [Principles of Ceylon Law, H.W.

Cave and Company, 1972, page 529] as follows:

Attempts to equate the principles of English law and Roman-Dutch law on

commercial matters by the judges brought about chaos and obscurity in

commercial law, resulting in great dissatisfaction among the powerful English

commercial circles in Ceylon. As a result of persistent agitation by the powerful

community, the English law on commercial matters was introduced by legislation.

Page 6 of 37

There are two such enactments which needs consideration. They are Ordinance No. 5 of

1852 and Ordinance No. 22 of 1866.

Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 sought to introduce into Ceylon the law of England in certain

cases. It appears that this legislation was enacted due to the representations made by the

Chamber of Commerce. Governor Sir John Anderson in his address to the Legislative

Council on 2nd September 1851 [See Addresses delivered in the Legislative Council of

Ceylon by Governors of the Colony, Vol. I, page 239], stated that in January 1850 the

Chamber of Commerce had, in an address presented to him, made certain complaints as

to the ill-working of the present laws in some respect and called for certain amendments

to be made.

He had referred certain passages of their address to the judges of the Supreme Court

requesting the judges to state if any amendments in the law as desired by the Chamber

was called for; and if so, what course they would recommend should be followed. The

judges had suggested several alterations in the laws and among others they considered

that all matters connected with shipping and all other maritime matters, and all questions

regarding bills of exchange should be decided by the Law of England. Thereafter

Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 was enacted.

Section 2 of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 read as follows:

The law to be hereafter administered in this Colony in respect of all contracts and

questions arising within the same upon or relating to bills of exchange, promissory

notes and cheques, and in respect of all matters connected with any such

instruments, shall be the same in respect of the said matters as would be

administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if the contract

had been entered into, or if the act in respect of which any such question shall have

arisen, had been done in England; unless in any case other provision is or shall be

made by any Ordinance now in force in this Colony or hereafter to be enacted."

Page 7 of 37

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance published in the

Ceylon Government Gazette No. 7,539 dated July 30, 1926 states that it reproduces

practically without alteration the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 of England which was in force

in Ceylon by virtue of Section 2 of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852. This was done as it was

considered desirable in view of the fact that many of the District Judges are not provided

with the English acts. Since this obviated the need to retain Section 2 of Ordinance No. 5

of 1852, it was repealed by Section 97(3) of Bills of Exchange Ordinance No. 25 of 1927

(Bills of Exchange Ordinance).

However, in order to address any argument based on any omission, Section 98 (2) of the

Bills of Exchange Ordinance provided that the rules of the common law of England,

including the law merchant, except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express

provisions of that Ordinance, or any other enactment for the time being in force, shall

apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques.

Within fourteen years of the enactment of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852, a further step was

taken by Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 towards introducing English law principles to govern

other areas of commercial law matters in Ceylon.

Governor Sir Hercules Robinson, addressing the Legislative Council on 3rd October 1866

[See Addresses delivered in the Legislative Council of Ceylon by Governors of the Colony,

Vol. 2, page 97] observed that Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 had been enacted to introduce

the law of England to the colony in maritime matters and in contracts and questions

arising out of bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques. Nevertheless, he declared

that the legislature was of the view that there were other commercial questions in which

it is desirable to assimilate our law with that of England such as questions relating to the

laws of partnership, joint stock companies, corporations, banks and banking, principals

and agents and life and fire insurance. In fact, he claimed that though it has not been

formally declared to be in force, the English law has been for years virtually administered

Page 8 of 37

in these matters and that for this purpose Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 would be laid before

the Council.

The judges of the Supreme Court were again consulted on this matter. They were of the

view that an Ordinance on these lines was desirable. They only opposed to it being one in

connection with immovable property [See Sessional Paper No. 12 of 1866].

Section 3 of Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 read as follows:

In all questions or issues which may hereafter arise or which may have to be

decided in this Colony, with respect to the law of Partnerships, Joint Stock

Companies, Corporations, Banks and Banking, Principals and Agents, Carriers by

land, Life and Fire Insurance, the law to be administered shall be the same as would

be administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if such

question or issue had arisen or had to be decided in England, unless in any case

other provision is or shall be made by any Ordinance now in force in this Colony or

hereafter to be enacted.

Provided that nothing herein contained shall be taken to introduce into this Colony

any part of the Law of England relating to the tenure or conveyance, or assurance

of, or succession to, any land or other immovable property, or any estate, right, or

interest therein.

In view of the repeal of Section 2 of the Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 as adumbrated above,

Sections 2 and 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance as set out in Legislative Enactments 1956

(Revised Edition) reads as follows:

2. The law to be hereafter administered in Ceylon in respect of all contracts or

questions arising within the same relating to ships and to the property therein, and

to the owners thereof, the behaviour of the master and mariners, and their

respective rights, duties, and liabilities, relating to the carriage of passengers and

Page 9 of 37

goods by ships, to stoppage in transit, to freight, demurrage, insurance, salvage,

average, collision between ships, to bills of lading, and generally to all maritime

matters, shall be the same in respect of the said matters as would be administered

in England in the like case at the corresponding period, if the contract had been

entered into or if the act in respect of which any such question shall have arisen had

been done in England, unless in any case other provision is or shall be made by any

enactment now in force in Ceylon or hereafter to be enacted.

3. In all questions or issues which may hereafter arise or which may have to be

decided in Sri Lanka with respect to the law of partnerships, corporations, banks

and banking, principals and agents, carriers by land, life and fire insurance, the law

to be administered shall be the same as would be administered in England in the

like case, at the corresponding period, if such question or issue had arisen or had

to be decided in England, unless in any case other provision is or shall be made by

any enactment now in force in Ceylon or hereafter to be enacted :

Provided that nothing herein contained shall be taken to introduce into Ceylon any

part of the Law of England relating to the tenure or conveyance, or assurance of, or

succession to, any land or other immovable property, or any estate, right, or interest

therein. (emphasis added)

For the reasons elucidated, I am of the view that this legislative history must play a pivotal

role in the interpretation of the scope and ambit of Section 3 of Civil Law Ordinance. I shall

revert to this later in interpreting the words Banks and Banking and All Questions or Issues

therein.

The proviso makes it clear that Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance did not intend to

introduce any part of the Law of England relating to the tenure or conveyance, or

assurance of, or succession to, any land or other immovable property, or any estate, right,

Page 10 of 37

or interest therein. These matters will continue to be governed by Roman-Dutch law or

any law that has been enacted subsequently.

Where English law is the applicable law by virtue of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance,

both English statutory law and common law will apply [See Peoples Bank v. Yashoda

Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. (2009 BLR 167), Wright and Three Others v. Peoples Bank (1985) 2

Sri.L.R. 292 at 295; Tambiah, Principles of Ceylon Law, H.W. Cave and Company, 1972, page

533, Weeramantry, Law of Contracts, First Indian Reprint 1999, Vol. I, page 46].

Moreover, even where legislative provisions have been subsequently enacted in Sri Lanka

on a particular subject identified in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance, English law will

apply where no specific provision has been made therein [See The Mahakande Housing

Company Ltd. v. Duhilamomal and Others (1981) 2 Sri.L.R. 232, Peoples Bank v. Yashoda

Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. (2009 BLR 167)].

Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance requires Court to apply, not only the English law in

force at the time of its enactment, but also any subsequent statute [Wright and Three

Others v. Peoples Bank (supra), cf. Usman v. Rahim (32 N.L.R. 259), Weeramantry

(supra.)].

Finally, it must be noted that the Civil Law Ordinance did not introduce English procedural

law, but only the substantive law in England [See Mudalihamy v. Punchi Banda (15 N.L.R.

350), The Government of The United States of America v. The Ship Valiant Enterprise

(63 N.L.R. 337 at 343)].

Corresponding Period

In Peoples Bank v. Yashoda Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. (supra), it was held that the relevant

period in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance is a date after the date of the institution

and/or a date after the answer has been filed. The Court was guided by the approach

adopted in The Shantha Rohan [(1994) 3 Sri.L.R. 54] where the Court of Appeal was

Page 11 of 37

interpreting the words "for the time being in force" used in Section 13(2) of the Judicature

Act.

It does not appear that the court gave its mind to the long-established common-law rule

that the rights of the parties must be determined as at the date of the institution of the

action [See Ponnammah v Arumugam (8 N.L.R. 223 at 226), Silva v. Nona Hamine (10

N.L.R. 44), Ponnamma v. Weerasuriya (11 N.L.R. 217), Silva v. Fernando et al (15 N.L.R.

499), Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo et al (22 N.L.R. 268 at 272), Sharieff et al v.

Marikkar et al (27 N.L.R. 349), Eminona v. Mohideen (32 N.L.R. 145), De Silva et al v.

Goonetileke et al (32 N.L.R. 217), De Silva v. Edirisuriya (41 N.L.R. 457), Lenorahamy v.

Abraham (43 N.L.R. 68), Kader Mohideen & Co. Ltd., v. Gany ( 60 N.L.R. 16), Abayadeera

and 162 others v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundera, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo and

Another (1983) 2 Sri. L. R. 267, Talagune v. De Livera (1997) 1 Sri.L.R. 253, Kalamazoo

Industries Ltd. and others v. Minister of Labour and Vocational Training and Others

(1998) 1 Sri.L.R. 235, Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank (1998) 3 Sri.L.R. 197, Jayaratna v.

Jayarathna and another (2002) 3 Sri.L.R. 331, Sithy Makeena and others v. Kuraisha and

others (2006) 2 Sri.L.R. 341, cf. Sabapathipillai et al v. Vaithialingam (40 N.L.R. 107),

Thangavadivel v. Inthiravathy (53 N.L.R. 369), Mariam Nurban Hussain Teyabally v.

Hon. R. Premadasa and two others [S.C. No. 69/92, S.C.M. 05.11.1993], Master Divers

(Pvt) Ltd. v. Karunaratne and others [CA (PHC) APN 140/2012, C.A.M. 09.08.2018].

In my view, the words at the corresponding period appearing in Section 3 of the Civil

Law Ordinance is insufficient to displace the common law rule that the rights of the parties

must be determined as at the date of the institution of the action.

Accordingly, where English law is applicable by virtue of Section 3 of the Civil Law

Ordinance, it is the English law prevailing at the date of the institution of the action that

must be applied to determine all questions or issues that may have to be decided with

respect to the law of banks and banking. However, I hasten to add that the position in

Page 12 of 37

English law relevant to the questions or issues that arise for determination does not differ

depending on the date of the institution of the action and/or a date after the answer has

been filed.

Banks and Banking

In Indian Bank v. Acuity Stock Brokers (Pvt) Limited [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 149 at pages 155-

6) Suresh Chandra J. appears to have adopted a narrower interpretation to banking in

holding that:

There is no clearcut demarcation of the transactions that one has with a Bank

being classified as Banking Transactions. It is usual to consider lodging money into

a bank account, withdrawing money, adding interest to an account, direct debits,

deducting bank charges, basically any sort of activity involving a change of money

in an account is a banking transaction which are usually listed in a bank account

statement.

I find it difficult to accede to such a narrow interpretation of banking. In Tennant v. Union

Bank of Canada (1894 AC 31 at 46)] it was held that banking is an expression wide enough

to embrace every transaction coming within the legitimate business of a banker. In

Nimalaratne Perera v. Peoples Bank [(2005) 2 Sri.L.R. 67 at 70] Amaratunga, J. adopted

this wider exposition and held that:

By Ordinance No. 22 of 1866, English Law relating to Banks and banking was

introduced into Ceylon and in all questions which arise in Ceylon with respect of the

law of banks and banking, the law to be administered is the same as would be

administered in England in the like case. The expression banking embraces every

transaction coming within the legitimate business of a banker [Tennant v. Union

Bank of Canada (1894 AC 31)]. Maintaining a current account between a bank and

a customer and granting a loan or other banking facilities are legitimate

Page 13 of 37

businesses relating to banking and accordingly the law applicable is the English

Law.(emphasis added)

I am in respectful agreement with this wider formulation of banking given the legislative

history of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance adumbrated earlier.

Moreover, the two words banks and banking in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance must

be read conjunctively. This view is supported by the dicta of Weeramantry, J. De Costa v.

Bank of Ceylon (72 N.L.R. 457 at 509) and Wijayatilake, J. in De Costa v. Bank of Ceylon

(supra. at 547). Not every question or issue where a Bank is a party will necessarily require

the application of English law. Similarly, not every question or issue which involves banking

necessarily makes English law the applicable law. It must be a question or issue with

respect to the law of banks and banking.

To that extent, I am in respectful agreement with the decision in Indian Bank v. Acuity

Stock Brokers (Pvt) Limited [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 149] where it was held that there are many

transactions, where the Banks are parties, which do not come within the realm of Banking

transactions and regarding which the Roman-Dutch law applies.

The Respondent is admittedly a Bank licensed under the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as

amended. Section 86 therein defines banking business to mean the business of

receiving funds from the public through the acceptance of money deposits payable upon

demand by cheque, draft, order or otherwise, and the use of such funds either in whole

or in part for advances, investments or any other operation either authorized by law or by

customary banking practices.

This action is based on a housing loan granted by the Respondent, a bank, to the

Appellant. The two primary questions or issues that arise for determination are with

respect to the law of banks and banking. They fall within banking in Section 3 of the Civil

Law Ordinance.

Page 14 of 37

Therefore, the question or issue on the alleged failure of consideration and its legal effect

must be determined by applying English law.

All Questions or Issues

Upon an examination of the answer of the Appellant, it is clear that the claim-in-

reconvention is based on the liability imputed to the Respondent for alleged breach of

contract which is co-extensive with liability in tort independently of the existence of the

contract.

Therefore, a consideration must be made of judicial precedent to ascertain the intention

of the legislature in using the words All questions or issues in Section 3 of the Civil Law

Ordinance.

My search for any judicial precedent instructive of the true interpretation of Section 3 of

the Civil Law Ordinance has been somewhat fruitless due to the lack of any intricate

attempt to fully expound the scope and ambit thereof.

In Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (33 N.L.R. 249 at 253) it was held that

the right of a pledgee to sell his security without recourse to a court of law is peculiar to

the English law of mortgage and pledge, and the common law of the land in the matter of

mortgage and pledge does not give place to the English law of mortgage and pledge, and

the common law of the land in the matter of mortgage and pledge does not give place to

the English law when the mortgage or pledge is a Bank. Nevertheless, this does not form

the ratio decidendi as none of the banks involved in that action sought to sell the security

they held without recourse to a court of law.

Similarly, in Mitchell v. Fernando (46 N.L.R. 265 at 269) Keuneman, J. was of the view that

the matter before court relates to the mortgage of movables and is not a matter with

respect to Joint Stock Companies. Court simply applied the dicta in Hong Kong and

Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra).

Page 15 of 37

The Court did not, in either of these cases, enter into an elaborate examination of Section

3 of the Civil Law Ordinance in order to determine its scope and ambit.

In Bank of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (59 N.L.R. 188) the question arose whether the drawer of

a crossed Not Negotiable cheque the amount of which is subsequently altered

fraudulently by a third party is entitled to recover from the collecting banker the amount

by which the cheque is so fraudulently raised. It was held (at page 189) that as our law on

the subject of a bankers liability is the same as in England (Section 3 of the Civil Law

Ordinance), except where special provision has been made in our law, the defendant

would be liable to pay to the plaintiff the amount that has been paid to the defendant by

his bank without his authority.

However, the decision in Bank of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (supra) was disapproved in Daniel

Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (67 N.L.R. 457) on the basis that the question whether the

action was really one where the banker was sought to be made liable on the basis of

conversion did not receive due attention by Court.

In Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra) the action was filed based on the English tort

of conversion. The question arose whether the English doctrine of conversion is part of

our law. The trial judge was of the view that it was in view of Section 98(2) of the Bills of

Exchange Ordinance and Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. In appeal, all three judges

agreed that the English doctrine of conversion was not part of the law of Ceylon.

Fernando, J. (at page 461) took the view that since the action was founded on a delict, the

Roman-Dutch law had to be applied. He held further that Section 98 (2) of the Bills of

Exchange Ordinance was only intended to apply to any omissions or deficiencies in the

Ordinance in respect of the law relating, inter alia, to cheques, and cannot form the basis

of a proposition that, where the delict of conversion was in relation to a cheque, therefore

the English common law of conversion is introduced into our law.

Page 16 of 37

Nevertheless, Fernando, J., did not engage in any detailed exposition of the scope and

ambit of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. Instead, the decisions in Hong Kong and

Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra) and Mitchell v. Fernando (supra) were cited with

approval.

Tambiah, J. having agreed with the findings of Fernando, J. went on to examine at length

the question whether the English doctrine of conversion is part of our law. He concluded

that the English doctrine of conversion was never tacitly adopted in Ceylon and is not part

of our common law.

Thereafter, Tambiah, J. went on to examine whether the English doctrine of conversion

has been applied to Bills of Exchange by statutory provision. In this examination he

considered Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. After considering the decisions in Hong

Kong and Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra), Mitchell v. Fernando (supra) and Bank

of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (supra), Tambiah, J., disagreed with the reasons given by

Basnayake, CJ., in Bank of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (supra) and concluded that despite section

3 of the Civil Law Ordinance, the common law of Ceylon on delict remained unaltered.

Alles, J. agreed with the judgment of Fernando, J.

However, none of the three justices made any detailed exposition of the scope and ambit

of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. The examination of the scope and ambit of Section

3 of the Civil Law Ordinance was perfunctory. To be fair by Court, the question of

examining the applicability of English law due to any connections with Banking matters

did not arise as the liability to be considered was not of a banker but of a person to whom

the cheque had been transferred by the forger or his agent.

Hence, the decisions in Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra), Mitchell

v. Fernando (supra) and Bank of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (supra) is of little assistance in

Page 17 of 37

expounding the scope and ambit of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance, and in particular

in relation to Banks and Banking.

Within about four years of the decision in Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra), a

bench of five judges of the Supreme Court was constituted in De Costa v. Bank of Ceylon

(72 N.L.R. 457) to settle the conflict of opinion as to whether the English law doctrine of

conversion is part of the law of Ceylon. Two out of the five judges, Fernando, C.J., and

Alles J. had been members of the bench in Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra).

Fernando, C.J. held (at page 465) that our Courts have not introduced and adopted the

basis of liability for conversion which obtains under the English common law. Hence his

conclusion was that this doctrine is not part of the common law of Ceylon.

Nevertheless, he went on to consider whether it has been introduced through statute

law. He first considered Section 2 of the Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 which read as follows:

The law to be hereafter administered in this Colony in respect of all contracts and

questions arising within the same upon or relating to bills of exchange, promissory

notes and cheques, and in respect of all matters connected with any such

instruments, shall be the same in respect of the said matters as would be

administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if the contract

had been entered into, or if the act in respect of which any such question shall have

arisen had been done in England; unless in any case other provision is or shall be

made by any Ordinance now in force in this Colony or hereafter to be enacted.

He held (at page 466) that at the time of the enactment of this section, the law of England

concerning contracts upon bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques, was the

common law, including the law merchant as developed at that stage, and thus Section 2

had accordingly the effect that the rights, duties and liabilities of parties to the contract

upon any such negotiable instrument would be regulated by the English common law.

Page 18 of 37

However, he held that there was more to it since Section 2 provided that the English law

would apply also in respect of all questions relating to such instruments and of all matters

connected with such instruments. If then a question arose as to the liability of a collecting

Banker to the true owner of a cheque, it could fairly be said that there was involved a

question relating to a cheque: one of the special incidents affecting a cheque, and perhaps

the most important such incident, is the collection of a cheque by one Bank from another,

and indeed the commercial practice of the making of payments in discharge of monetary

liabilities by means of cheques is rendered effective through the system of the collection

by Banks of the proceeds of cheques, and if in English law a Banker incurred a liability to

the true owner of a cheque because he had collected the proceeds and credited them to

the account of a customer, the law by reason of which that liability arose could fairly be

regarded as the law in respect of a question relating to a cheque.

Accordingly, he held that so long as Section 2 of the Ordinance of 1852 was in force, the

liability of a collecting Bank in Ceylon in circumstances such as exist in that case had to be

determined by the application of the English law. Thereafter he went on to examine the

English Act of 1882 and held (at page 469) that all of its provisions applied in Ceylon by

virtue of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 and that from 1882, the liability of a collecting Bank in

Ceylon was the same as that which arose in England in similar circumstances.

Nevertheless, he held (at page 472) that after the Bills of Exchange Ordinance was

enacted in 1927, it is that law and not Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 which is applicable, and

that although the English doctrine of conversion is not part of the common law of Ceylon,

the Bills of Exchange Ordinance (Cap. 82) has the effect that the liability of a collecting

Bank in Ceylon to the true owner of a cheque is the same as would arise in England in a

like case.

Page 19 of 37

Sirimane, J. held that in consequence of the two enactments, Section 2 of Civil Law

Ordinance, and Section 98 (2) of Bills of Exchange Ordinance), he was of the view that in

all matters connected with bills of exchange a person who would be liable in English Law

would also be liable in Ceylon, and to that extent the English Law of conversion is part of

our law.

He sought to fortify this conclusion by reference to Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance.

He held (at page 484) that different branches of the law often overlap, and cannot be

looked at in separate water-tight compartments. Conversion has been adapted, modified,

and applied to bankers and the business carried on by them, so much so that no book on

the law of banking can be complete without a discussion on this subject. It has grown with

the law of banks and banking, and become part of that law. He went on to state that if

the Plaintiff in that case had consulted a lawyer in regard to the liability of the banker, he

would not expect the latter to refer to a treatise on the doctrine of conversion, or the

Roman Dutch Law relating to delicts, or the Principles of Negligence but rather to a text

book on the law of banks and banking.

Alles, J. took the view that Section 2 of the Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 did not contemplate

the introduction of the English doctrine of conversion into our law dealing with cheques.

Having examined Section 2, he held (at page 494) that although there must have been an

inherent desire of the Englishmen of the time, for the purposes of promoting trade and

commerce in their colonies to introduce bodily the law of England of the relevant period

relating to bills of exchange, it does not appear to him, that the language of Section 2 gave

effect to that intention.

Alles, J. also considered the application of Section 3 of Civil Law Ordinance. After a

perfunctory examination, he agreed with the views of Tambiah, J. in Daniel Silva v.

Johanis Appuhamy (supra) and the decisions in Hongkong & Shanghai Bank Corporation

v. Krishnapillai (supra) and Mitchell v. Fernando (supra) that the rights and liabilities of

Page 20 of 37

the banker under our law are not affected by the introduction of the English law of Banks

and Banking.

Weeramantry, J. agreed with the conclusion in Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra)

that the doctrine of conversion forms no part of the general law of Ceylon. However, he

observed that the case of Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra) does not offer any

guidance on whether the transaction under examination attracts the English or the

Roman-Dutch law by reason of its connection with matters of banking as it did not have

to deal with the liability of a banker.

Weeramantry, J. differed from that decision and held (at page 509) that rights of a bona

fide holder for value of a negotiable instrument is governed by English law. It was held

that such a transaction attracts the English law relating to conversion although the

doctrine of conversion forms no part of our general law.

Weeramantry, J. however observed that the conclusion that the English law of conversion

does not as a general doctrine form part of the law of this country does not dispose of the

matter before court, in view of the further questions whether, in so far as concerns

cheques and matters of banks and banking, the English principles of conversion are drawn

into our legal system.

He held that it would be unrealistic to take the view that the law relating to conversion

forms no part of the law of banks and banking and that the Civil Law Ordinance as

amended by Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 brought into this country the English rules relating

to conversion in so far as they had become the subject of special application to the law of

banks and banking. Much emphasize was laid on the fact that one party to the impugned

transaction was a bank.

Page 21 of 37

Wijayatilake, J. held (at page 545) that English law was applicable in view of Section 2 of

Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 and laid much emphasis on the words and in respect of all

matters connected with such instruments or if the act in respect of which any question

shall have arisen, had been done in England.

Hence it is clear that neither Fernando, C.J., nor Alles, J. engaged in a detailed exposition

of the scope and ambit of Section 3 of Civil Law Ordinance in Daniel Silva v. Johanis

Appuhamy (supra) or in De Costa v. Bank of Ceylon (supra). Wijayatilake, J. did not

consider it in De Costa v. Bank of Ceylon (supra). However, Weeramantry, J. and Sirimane,

J. did so in that case. Their approach exemplifies the need to bear in the mind the

legislative history to identify the intention of the legislature.

In my view, the correct approach to interpreting Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance is to

examine the import of each and every word in that section. We must act on the

assumption that the legislature did not use any surpluses. The legislative history must be

our guiding light in this exercise. In fact, we now know that the legislature was clearly

aware of the circumstances which led to its enactment. As Tambiah aptly explains, the

English law on commercial matters was introduced to Ceylon by legislation in view of the

chaos and obscurity brought about by attempts by English judges to equate the principles

of English law and Roman-Dutch law on commercial matters.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance requires, in

addition to interpreting Corresponding Period and Banks and Banking which I have sought

to do above, an interpretation of the words All Questions or Issues as well. Such an

approach gives due deference to the legislative history adumbrated earlier.

In granting of loans or carrying on any other banking facilities, there may be situations

where a question on the liability of a bank may arise under contract as well as tort [See

Trans Orbit Global Logistics (Pvt) Limited v. Peoples Bank [S.C. Appeal 92/2020, S.C.M.

13.12.2021)].

Page 22 of 37

This is the settled position in English law after years of judicial and academic debate [See

Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. (1995) 2 AC 145, Burrows (Remedies for Torts and

Breach of Contract, (2nd Ed., page 4, Butterworths, 1994)].

Chitty on Contracts [28th ed., (Vol. 1)(1999), pages 38 and 39] in discussing the

development of the law with regard to the relationship between contract and tort states

as follows:

"Where the constituent elements of a claimant's case are capable of being put

either in terms of a claim in tort or for breach of contract, the general rule is that

the claimant may choose on which basis to proceed, though this rule is subject to a

number of qualifications, notably where to do so would be inconsistent with the

terms of the contract. This traditional position was clearly affirmed by the House of

Lords in the important decision Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. which drew to

close the uncertainty on this point caused by a dictum of Lord Scarman in the Privy

Council in 1985 in Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd, v. Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd ............ This

dictum (of Lord Scarman) appeared to favour the exclusion of claims in tort where

the parties were in a contractual relationship, though the context of its acceptance

by later Courts was typically the denial of liability of recovery of pure economic loss

in the tort of negligence. However, paradoxically, the House of Lords' decision on

the nature and ambit of the tortious liability to be found on the facts before it in

Henderson v. Marrett Syndicates Ltd. created new and very considerable

uncertainty as regards the relationship of contractual and tortious claims between

parties to a contract. For, it accepted that its own earlier decision in Hedley Byrne

& Co. Ltd. v. Heller and Partners Ltd should be interpreted as establishing a "broad

principle" of liability in tortious negligence based on the defendant's assumption of

responsibility, an assumption which would appear to be satisfied whenever a party

Page 23 of 37

to a contract either possessing or holding himself out as possessing a special skill

agrees to perform a service for the other party."

In Jayamohan v. Hatton National Bank Ltd. [(2001) 3 Sri.L.R. 392 at 404], Wigneswaran,

J. having cited this extract with approval went on to state that Lord Goff of Chieveley had

in Henderson's case held that a very broad principle of liability based on an "assumption

of responsibility" had been established after the decision in Hedley Byrne's case and that

this principle suggested a very considerable overlap between the tort of negligence and

liability in contract between parties to contracts.

Moreover, Banks have been held liable for breach of contract as well as in tort [See

Barclays Bank plc v. Quincecare Ltd. and another [(1992) 4 All ER 363 at 375-6].

Where such questions or issues arise both under contract as well as tort in relation to

an action brought against a bank by its customer on a banking transaction, they are all

questions or issues which arise with respect to the law of banks and banking, and the

law to be administered shall be the same as would be administered in England in the like

case, at the corresponding period. I am fortified to adopt this approach upon a

consideration of the reasons for introducing English law to specified areas by the Civil Law

Ordinance as adumbrated above.

Moreover, a similar approach was approved of by Fernando, CJ in De Costa v. Bank of

Ceylon (supra. at 466) in interpreting Section 2 of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852. It was held:

At the time of the enactment of this section, the law of England concerning

contracts upon bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques, was the common

law, including the law merchant as developed at that stage, and s. 2. had

accordingly the effect that the rights, duties and liabilities of parties to the contract

upon any such negotiable instrument would be regulated by the English common

law. But this was not the only effect of the section; for it provided that the English

Page 24 of 37

law would apply also in respect of all questions relating to such instruments and

of all matters connected with such instruments. If then a question arose as to the

liability of a collecting Banker to the true owner of a cheque, it could fairly be said

that there was involved a question relating to a cheque: one of the special

incidents affecting a cheque, and perhaps the most important such incident, is the

collection of a cheque by one Bank from another, and indeed the commercial

practice of the making of payments in discharge of monetary liabilities by means of

cheques is rendered effective through the system of the collection by Banks of the

proceeds of cheques, and if in English law a Banker incurred a liability to the true

owner of a cheque because he had collected the proceeds and credited them to

the account of a customer, the law by reason of which that liability arose could

fairly be regarded as the law in respect of a question relating to a cheque.

[]

The particular provision of s. 2 of the Ordinance of 1852 which I am now examining

is the declaration that "in all questions relating to cheques, the law to be

administered shall be the same as would be administered in England in like case".

The construction of this provision requires primarily a determination whether

there is for decision some question relating to a cheque; and if the determination

is that there is such a question, then the English law must be administered to

decide the question. I can concede that not every matter concerning a cheque, such

as the mere theft of a cheque or the placing of a cheque in the custody of some

person, is a "question" contemplated in the provision. But where the alleged or

proved circumstances indicate some dealing with a cheque which is peculiar to

its character as a cheque, and which is for a purpose connected with that

character, and some question then arises as to the effect or consequences of such

dealing, does not that question relate to a cheque? If this be not so, the reference

Page 25 of 37

in the provision under consideration to "questions relating to cheque" apparently

adds nothing to the matters denoted in the earlier reference in s. 2 to "contracts"

upon cheques. Moreover, the subsequent reference in s. 2 to "all matters connected

with cheques" would appear to be quite without purpose if a dealing of the nature

I am contemplating is not to be regarded as such a matter. I rely in this connection

on the reasons stated by Lord Denning for the opinion that the collection of cheques

by a Banker is characteristic of a Banker's business. (United Dominions Trust v.

Kirkwood [(1966) 1 A. E. R. 968.]). (emphasis added)

The claim-in-reconvention is based upon the alleged breach of a duty of care arising from

the alleged undertaking of the Respondent to advise the Appellant on the title to the

demised property. The alleged undertaking was given qua banker with respect to a loan

transaction. It is a question or issue with respect to the law of banks and banking.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the action instituted by the Respondent to recover

the amount due on the housing loan agreement as well as the claim-in-reconvention

made by the Appellant based on an alleged breach of duty of care must be determined by

applying English law.

Failure of Consideration in English Law

The defense of the Appellant to the pleaded cause of action is that valid title to the

demised premises did not pass to the Appellant on Deed No. 3135 and consequently there

was a total failure of the consideration of Rs. 18,200,000/=. Accordingly, it is contended

that no money is due to the Respondent from the Appellant.

Before I proceed to examine the housing loan agreement to identify its consideration, an

examination of the position in English law on the meaning attributed to consideration in

general and in the context of failure of consideration must be done.

Page 26 of 37

There are at least three possible meanings that can be attributed to the expression

consideration in English law. The primary meaning is based on reciprocity and is the

advantage conferred or detriment suffered which is necessary to turn a promise not

under seal into a binding contract. Lord Wilberforce in Midland Bank Trust Co. Ltd. and

Another v. Green [(1981) AC 513 at 531] held that valuable consideration is an

expression denoting an advantage conferred or detriment suffered.

The locus classicus of the meaning of consideration in English law is found in Currie and

Others v. Misa [(1875) LR 10 Ex 153 at 162] and reads as follows:

a valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right,

interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment,

loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.

Academic opinion differs on the reciprocity approach to consideration. McKendrick

[Contract Law, 11th ed., 2015, pages 67-68] provides a succinct summary of the debate

between Treitel and Atiyah on the traditional interpretation. I need not venture to take a

definitive position in view of the meaning attributed to consideration in English law in the

context of failure of consideration which is discussed below.

Secondly, the expression consideration is equated to causa or justa causa as known to

Roman law and reflected in the traditional conveyancing expression in consideration of

natural love and affection [See Birks, An Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1985),

page 223].

Page 27 of 37

The third meaning of the expression consideration is found in the context of failure of

consideration and its locus classicus is found in the speech of Viscount Simon LC in Fibrosa

Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd. [(1943) AC 32 at 48] where he

stated:

In English law, an enforceable contract may be formed by an exchange of a

promise for a promise, or by the exchange of a promise for an actand thus, in the

law relating to the formation of a contract, the promise to do a thing may often be

the consideration, but when one is considering the law of failure of consideration

and the quasi-contractual right to recover money on that ground, it is, generally

speaking, not the promise which is referred to as the consideration, but the

performance of the promise. The money was paid to secure performance and, if

performance fails the inducement which brought about the payment is not

fulfilled. (emphasis added)

This approach was approved nearly half a century later in Rover International Ltd v.

Cannon Film Sales Ltd [(1989) 1 WLR 912 at 923] by Kerr LJ who held that the test is

whether or not the party claiming total failure of consideration has in fact received any

part of the benefit bargained for under the contract or purported contract.

According to this approach, what is crucial is that the recipient of the payment should

have given or done at least part of what was understood to be due in return for the

payment. There is strong academic support for this approach [Andrew Burrows, The Law

of Restitution (2nd ed, 2002) 324-325; Andrew Burrows, Ewan McKendrick and James

Edelman Cases and Materials on the Law of Restitution (2nd ed, 2006) 251; Graham Virgo

The Principles of the Law of Restitution (2nd ed, 2006) 306].

However, recently a different approach has been taken in holding that failure of

consideration is not exclusively concerned with performance. The view has been

expressed that failure of consideration focuses not on performance, but on the underlying

Page 28 of 37

legal validity of the transaction [See Guinness Mahon & Co Ltd v. Kensington and Chelsea

Royal London Borough Council [(1999) QB 215], Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale

v. Islington London Borough Council [(1996) AC 669]

Either way, I am of the view that there is no failure of consideration in the present case.

The Appellant seeks to make out that there was an obligation on the part of the

Respondent to pass good and valid title to the demised premises to the Appellant which

did not happen due to the negligence of the Respondent and the Notary appointed by the

Respondent. It is on this basis that the Appellant claims that there has been a failure of

consideration.

This is factually misconceived. The Appellant applied for a housing loan. The Respondent

agreed to lend a sum of Rs. 18,200,000/= to the Appellant on the undertaking that he will

repay the loan in agreed instalments. Admittedly the loan was received by the Appellant.

For failure of consideration to occur, the Appellant should have been deprived of the

benefit of the performance of the promise made to him. On the contrary, the Appellant

received the benefit of the performance of the promise made by the Respondent, namely

the lending of money.

In these circumstances, I hold that there is no failure of consideration for the housing loan

agreement. The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court correctly entered judgment

as prayed for in the plaint.

Claim-in-Reconvention

According to the Appellant, he is a Premier Customer of the Respondent and as such

enjoys several concessions and privileges over and above normal customers. Around

2004, he was looking out to purchase a housing property. A broker named Mohan

informed him that the demised property was for sale. The Appellant intimated his interest

to purchase the demised premises to the Respondent.

Page 29 of 37

The Appellant claims that the Respondent had not only agreed to grant the housing loan

but had also agreed to advise on the title to the property, and to arrange notarial services

for the execution of the transfer deed notwithstanding the usual practice of the buyer

nominating his own notary to write the transfer deed.

The Respondent had, as part of the services offered to a Premier Customer, met with

the intermediaries, retained the services of their own lawyers Julius & Creasy to carry out

a title search, recommended the title, sent their officers to the demised premises and

checked out all relevant matters.

According to the Appellant, the Respondent represented and warranted that the title was

perfect by causing a deed of transfer to be drawn up and providing facilities to the

Appellant for the purchase of the demised property. It is further alleged that the

Respondent did not recommend a title insurance to be taken and thereby represented

that there was no defect or any other deficiency in the title.

The Appellant alleges that the intention of the Respondent was purely to engage in

business without realizing that it owed a duty of care towards the Appellant. It is alleged

that this fact is evident by the actions of the Respondent to retain a lawyer from lawyers

retained by it to attest the deed of transfer pertaining to the demised premises.

It is alleged that the documentation used to transfer the demised premises, in particular

the alleged defects in the attestation clause, establish the negligence of the Respondent

and its notary in the matter of ascertaining the identity of the vendor of the demised

premises.

Duty of Care in English Law

There is no general legal obligation for a bank to advice its clients or to warn them of

potential risks in most ordinary banking transactions including lending. Moreover, even

Page 30 of 37

where a banking transaction is an inherently hazardous transaction, that by itself is

generally insufficient to give rise to a duty of care.

For a bank to owe such a duty, the customer must request advice and the bank must

accept or the customer and the bank must agree to an arrangement under which the bank

is to provide advice.

The duty will be contractual where the claimant can prove a contract under which the

bank has agreed to advise. However, banks often take the precaution of excluding such

characterization of the relationship in the contractual documentation. Therefore, more

often than not, a claimant is left with establishing a tortious duty to advise on the part of

the bank. Such a duty arises in exceptional circumstances [See Lloyds Bank Plc v. Cobb

(1991) 12 Legal Decisions Affecting Bankers 210 (CA), Williams & Glyns Bank Ltd. v.

Barnes [1981] Com LR 205)].

The general proposition that banks owe no duty to advise their customers or to warn

them of probable risks applies to most ordinary banking transactions, not only to lending.

Even intrinsically risky transactions are not generally sufficient to give rise to a duty.

Thus, in Redmond v. Allied Irish Bank Plc [(1987) 2 FTLR 264], the customer paid into his

account endorsed, non-transferable cheques marked as payable only to the account of a

third party. It was held that the bank had no duty to warn the customer of the dangers

involved in this risky practice. In Finch and another v. Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others

[(2016) EWHC 1236 (QB)] it was held that a bank owed no duty to advise its customer as

to the existence and effect of a particularly onerous term in the loan agreement that the

bank was offering.

The claim-in-reconvention specifically claims that there was a breach of a duty of care.

The contractual arrangements between the parties do not contain any express provision

Page 31 of 37

to take care. The case of the Appellant is that the Respondent agreed to advise the

Appellant.

I shall begin by examining the decision in Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd

[(1964) AC 465] upon which the Appellant has based his claim-in-reconvention.

In Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd (supra) the question arose whether

bankers could be held liable in tort in respect of the gratuitous provision of a negligently

favourable reference for one of their customers, when they knew or ought to have known

that the customer would rely on their skill and judgment in furnishing the reference, and

the customer in fact relied upon it and consequently suffered financial loss.

The locus classicus on this issue is found in the speech of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest (at

paragraphs 502-503) who laid down as a general principle that:

[] it follows and that it should now be regarded as settled that if someone

possessed of a special skill undertakes, quite irrespective of contract, to apply that

skill for the assistance of another person who relies on such skill, a duty of care will

arise. The fact that the services is to be given by means of, or by the instrumentality

of, words can make no difference. Furthermore, if in a sphere in which a person is

so placed that others could reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or on his

ability to make careful inquiry, a person takes it on himself to give information or

advice to, or allows his information or advice to be passed on to, another person

who, as he knows or should know, will place reliance on it, then a duty of care will

arise.

Their Lordships confirmed that this principle applies to banks providing advice in the

course of business to their customers, and approved Lord Finlay LCs statement in Banbury

v. Bank of Montreal [(1918) A.C. 626] that a banker is under no obligation to advise, but

if he takes upon himself to do so, he will incur liability if he does so negligently.

Page 32 of 37

All the law Lords in Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd (supra) approached

the issue in terms of one party having assumed or undertaken responsibility towards the

other. Nevertheless, it is now established that the principle enunciated therein extends

beyond the provision of information and advice to include performance of other services.

In Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd (supra) the House of Lords distinguished

between deliberate advice and casual or perfunctory conversations. In the former

case, the bank will be considered to have assumed responsibility while in the latter case,

it will not.

Two examples are found in Michael Wilson and another v. MF Global UK Ltd. and

another [(2011) EWHC 138 (QB)] and The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman Sachs

International [(2016) EWHC 2530 (Ch)]. In Wilson (supra. para. 96) it was held that the

conversations in which the advice was allegedly given were best characterised as

exchanging information and bouncing ideas off each other or swapping hunches about

the market, much of it being spontaneous and off the cuff. The court declined to hold

that the defendant had assumed any responsibility for what was said.

On the contrary, in The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman Sachs International

[(2016) EWHC 2530 (Ch), para. 258] a claim concerning the sale of complex investment

products, Rose, J. drew what was described as a critical distinction between a situation

where the bank gives advice on stock market opportunities going beyond the normal

remit of a counterparty bank and situations where senior executives of the bank and

the client have general discussions in an informal setting about how the individuals see

the markets developing and about the prospects for particular stocks or sectors. Liability

may be attached to the former, while no liability is attached to the latter.

The most difficult question in determining whether a bank has breached any duty of care

in tort is to determine whether it has assumed responsibility. The ultimate question is

whether, viewed objectively, the facts of the transaction show that the bank assumed a

Page 33 of 37

responsibility to advise on its suitability [Fine Care Homes Ltd v. National Westminster

Bank Plc and another [2020] EWHC 3233 (Ch) at paragraph 107].

Evaluation of Evidence

There is nothing in the loan agreement to indicate that the Respondent took upon itself

the obligation to pass valid title to the demised premises to the Appellant. In this context,

I must refer to the distinction between warranty of title and an undertaking to warrant

and defend title. In Chellappah v. McHeyzer et al. (38 NLR 393 at 396) Soertsz, J. held:

An express warranty of title occurs when a vendor in so many words warrants that

he has a good and lawful title. Whereas in every contract of sale, other than one in

which the vendor definitely states that he will not warrant and defend title, there is

implied, if it is not expressed, an undertaking to warrant and defend title if and

when it is challenged. In the present case, clearly there is no express warranty of

title but only an explicit undertaking to warrant and defend it.

In Prenn v. Simmonds [(1971) 1 WLR 1381 at 1385] Lord Wilberforce held that for the

purpose of construing written agreement evidence should be restricted to evidence of

the factual background known to the parties at or before the date of the contract including

evidence of the genesis and objectively the aim of the transaction.

The evidence establishes that it is the Appellant who identified the demised premises for

purchase and sought a housing loan and approached the Respondent for the loan.

The Deed of Transfer No. 3135 by which the Appellant sought to obtain title to the

demised premises and the Mortgage Bond No. 3136 were executed on the same day,

namely 5th June 2006.

In clause 3 of the Mortgage Bond No.3136 dated 5thJune 2006, the Appellant has given a

warranty of title in stating that he has good right and full power to mortgage and

hypothecate the demised premises.

Page 34 of 37

By clause 2 therein, the Appellant agreed with the Respondent to warrant and defend the

title to the demised premises.

Clearly, the Appellant gave the Respondent a warranty of title as well as agreeing to

warrant and defend the title to the demised premises.

These warranties given on the date of execution of both the deed of transfer and

mortgage bond run counter to the assertion of the Appellant that the Respondent was

under a duty to pass valid and legal title to the demised premises. The Appellant could

not have warranted title to the Respondent and also undertaken to warrant and defend

title had the Respondent undertaken to pass good and valid title to the demised premises

to the Appellant. This is fatal to the claim of the Appellant that the Respondent agreed to

advise on the title to the demised property.

An important element of the advisory claim of the Appellant is that the Respondent

arranged notarial services for the Appellant through its lawyer Mallikaratchige Dilrukshi

Lalani Perera of M/s Julius & Creasy. Nevertheless, according to letter dated 05.06.2006

(P5), the Appellant had written to M/s Julius & Creasy requesting them to act on his behalf

in respect of the purchase of the demised premises in his name. Therein he has specifically

acknowledged that he is aware that M/s Julius & Creasy are acting as lawyers for the

Respondent in respect of the mortgage of the demised premises to be executed by the

Appellant and that he has no objection to M/s Julius & Creasy acting on his behalf as well.

The Appellant contends that this letter was prepared by the Respondent and he had no

choice other than to sign it as otherwise the loan would not have been granted. However,

he did of course have choices such as seeking independent advice from another notary

which he did not.

Moreover, the attempt to assimilate the role of the said notary as that of the Respondent

is factually misconceived. The said notary was a member of the M/s Julius & Creasy

Page 35 of 37

retained by the Respondent to provide professional advice to its in relation to the

transaction. She was also retained by the Appellant to advise him with the full knowledge

of the professional relationship between the said notary and the Respondent.

In this context, the decision in Bristol & West Building Society v. Mothew [(1998) Ch 1] is

instructive.

The plaintiff advanced money to a husband and wife secured by way of a first mortgage

on the house they were buying. The defendant solicitor, was acting on behalf of both the

plaintiff and the husband and wife throughout the purchasing process.

The loan did not cover the entire purchase price the lenders therefore required an

express assurance that the balance would be supplied by the purchasers personal

finance, rather than a second mortgage loan.

The defendant solicitor mistakenly provided this assurance, and so when the purchasers

defaulted on their repayments and the lenders enforced their security by selling the

property at a loss. The plaintiff sought to recover their whole net loss from the defendant

for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of trust or fiduciary duty.

Lord Millett (at page 18) considered the position of a fiduciary who acts for two principals

with potentially conflicting interests without the informed consent of both and held that

there is a breach of the obligation of undivided loyalty. In that situation the fiduciary puts

himself in a position where his duty to one principal may conflict with his duty to the other

and described it as the double employment rule.

It was held (at page 19) that the breach of the rule automatically constitutes a breach of

a fiduciary duty. However, Lord Millett went on to hold that the plaintiff could not

complain of this given that it was aware that the defendant was acting for the purchasers

when it instructed him and that was the very reason why it chose the defendant to act

for it. This is exactly on point with the facts of this appeal.

Lord Millett went on to state that even if a fiduciary is properly acting for two principals

with potentially conflicting interests he must act in good faith in the interests of each and

must not act with the furthering the interests of one principal to the prejudice of those of

the other. He must serve each as faithfully and loyally as if he were his only principal.

Taking the case of the Appellant at the highest, even if it is assumed that the notary was

negligent in executing the deed of transfer by failing to properly investigate the title, the

liability lies with the said notary and not the Respondent as rightly pointed out by the

learned Judge of the Commercial High Court.

The Appellant also seeks to rely on the Respondent obtaining all documentation relating

to the title to the demised property to be consistent with its obligation to ensure that the

Appellant gets good title, and would be able to afford good security for the loan to the

bank.

Nevertheless, the purpose of taking a collateral as security for the grant of a housing loan

and the grant of the housing loan itself must be viewed from different perspectives, that

of the Appellant and the Respondent.

As Lord Millett observed in the Privy Council in National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd

v. Hew and Others [(2003)UKPC 51, para. 21] even where a lender insists that the money

lent be used in a particular way, it does not even amount to tacit advice that the proposed

project is a viable one. He went on to explain that (at para. 22):

It may well have been foolhardy of Mr. Hew [the customer] to embark on the

project without obtaining estimates of the likely costs and cash flow forecasts; but

the bank was under no duty to advise him against such a course. It may have been

unwise of Mr. Cobham [the bank manager] to have lent the money without insisting

on being provided with such estimates and forecasts and without having conducted

a feasibility study of his own. But as Mr. Cobham explained, any such study would

Page 37 of 37

have been for the Banks protection, not Mr. Hews. The reason he did not call for

such a study is that he did not think that the Banks interests required it; the Bank

had sufficient security to support a much larger loan than anything that was

contemplated at the time. This is a useful illustration of the truism that the

viability of a transaction may depend on the vantage point from which it is

viewed; what is a viable loan may not be a viable borrowing. This is one reason

why a borrower is not entitled to rely on the fact that the lender has chosen to

lend him the money as evidence, still less as advice, that the lender thinks that

the purpose for which the borrower intends to use it is sound. (emphasis added)

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Respondent did not undertake to advise the

Appellant on the housing transaction or give any warranty of title to the demised

premises. The claim-in-reconvention must necessarily fail.

The judgment of the Commercial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo

dated 08.08. 2012 is affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 1,00,000/=.

Appeal dismissed.
