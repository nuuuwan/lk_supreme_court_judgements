"I must refer to the distinction between warranty of title and an undertaking to warrant"
"and defend title. In Chellappah v. McHeyzer et al. (38 NLR 393 at 396) Soertsz, J. held:"
"“An express warranty of title occurs when a vendor in so many words warrants that"
"he has a good and lawful title. Whereas in every contract of sale, other than one in"
"which the vendor definitely states that he will not warrant and defend title, there is"
"implied, if it is not  expressed, an undertaking to  warrant and defend title if and"
"when it is challenged. In the present case, clearly there is no express warranty of"
"title but only an explicit undertaking to warrant and defend it.”"
