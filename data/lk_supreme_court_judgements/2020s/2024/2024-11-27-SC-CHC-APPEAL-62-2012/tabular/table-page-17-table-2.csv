"Nevertheless, he went on to consider whether it has been introduced through statute"
"law. He first considered Section 2 of the Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 which read as follows:"
"“The law to be hereafter administered in this Colony in respect of all contracts and"
"questions arising within the same upon or relating to bills of exchange, promissory"
"notes  and  cheques,  and 
in  respect  of  all  matters  connected  with  any  such"
"instruments,  shall  be  the  same 
in  respect  of  the  said  matters  as  would  be"
"administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if the contract"
"had been entered into, or if the act in respect of which any such question shall have"
"arisen had been done in England; unless in any case other provision is or shall be"
"made by any Ordinance now in force in this Colony or hereafter to be enacted.”"
