"where  a  banking  transaction  is  an  inherently  hazardous  transaction,  that  by  itself  is"
"generally insufficient to give rise to a duty of care."
"For  a  bank  to  owe  such  a  duty,  the  customer  must  request  advice  and  the  bank  must"
"accept or the customer and the bank must agree to an arrangement under which the bank"
"is to provide advice."
"The duty will be contractual where the claimant can prove a contract under which the"
"bank has agreed to advise. However, banks often take the precaution of excluding such"
"characterization of the relationship in the contractual documentation. Therefore, more"
"often than not, a claimant is left with establishing a tortious duty to advise on the part of"
"the bank. Such a duty arises in exceptional circumstances [See Lloyds Bank Plc v. Cobb"
"(1991)  12  Legal  Decisions  Affecting  Bankers  210  (CA),  Williams  &  Glynâ€™s  Bank  Ltd.  v."
"Barnes [1981] Com LR 205)]."
"The  general  proposition  that  banks  owe  no  duty  to  advise  their  customers  or  to  warn"
"them of probable risks applies to most ordinary banking transactions, not only to lending."
"Even intrinsically risky transactions are not generally sufficient to give rise to a duty."
"Thus, in Redmond v. Allied Irish Bank Plc [(1987) 2 FTLR 264], the customer paid into his"
"account endorsed, non-transferable cheques marked as payable only to the account of a"
"third party. It was held that the bank had no duty to warn the customer of the dangers"
"involved in this risky practice.  In Finch and another v. Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others"
"[(2016) EWHC 1236 (QB)] it was held that a bank owed no duty to advise its customer as"
"to the existence and effect of a particularly onerous term in the loan agreement that the"
"bank was offering."
"The claim-in-reconvention specifically claims that there was a breach of a duty of care."
"The contractual arrangements between the parties do not contain any express provision"
