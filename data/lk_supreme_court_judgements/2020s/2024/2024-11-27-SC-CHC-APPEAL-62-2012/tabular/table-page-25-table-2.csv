"Kirkwood [(1966) 1 A. E. R. 968.]).‚Äù (emphasis added)"
"The claim-in-reconvention is based upon the alleged breach of a duty of care arising from"
"the  alleged  undertaking  of  the  Respondent  to  advise  the  Appellant  on  the  title  to  the"
"demised property. The alleged undertaking was given qua banker with respect to a loan"
"transaction. It is a question or issue with respect to the law of banks and banking."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the action instituted by the Respondent to recover"
"the  amount  due  on  the  housing  loan  agreement  as  well  as  the  claim-in-reconvention"
"made by the Appellant based on an alleged breach of duty of care must be determined by"
"applying English law."
"Failure of Consideration in English Law"
"The  defense  of  the  Appellant  to  the  pleaded  cause  of  action  is  that  valid  title  to  the"
"demised premises did not pass to the Appellant on Deed No. 3135 and consequently there"
"was a total failure of the consideration of Rs. 18,200,000/=. Accordingly, it is contended"
"that no money is due to the Respondent from the Appellant."
"Before I proceed to examine the housing loan agreement to identify its consideration, an"
"examination of the position in English law on the meaning attributed to consideration in"
"general and in the context of failure of consideration must be done."
