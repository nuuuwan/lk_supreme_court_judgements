"the banker under our law are not affected by the introduction of the English law of Banks"
"and Banking."
"Weeramantry, J. agreed with the conclusion in Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra)"
"that the doctrine of conversion forms no part of the general law of Ceylon. However, he"
"observed that the case of Daniel Silva v. Johanis Appuhamy (supra) does not offer any"
"guidance  on  whether  the  transaction  under  examination  attracts  the  English  or  the"
"Roman-Dutch law by reason of its connection with matters of banking as it did not have"
"to deal with the liability of a banker."
"Weeramantry, J. differed from that decision and held (at page 509) that rights of a bona"
"fide holder for value of a negotiable instrument is governed by English law.  It was held"
"that  such  a  transaction  attracts  the  English  law  relating  to  conversion  although  the"
"doctrine of conversion forms no part of our general law."
"Weeramantry, J. however observed that the conclusion that the English law of conversion"
"does not as a general doctrine form part of the law of this country does not dispose of the"
"matter  before  court,  in  view  of  the  further  questions  whether,  in  so  far  as  concerns"
"cheques and matters of banks and banking, the English principles of conversion are drawn"
"into our legal system."
"He held that it would be unrealistic to take the view that the law relating to conversion"
"forms  no  part  of  the  law  of  banks  and  banking  and  that  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  as"
"amended by Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 brought into this country the English rules relating"
"to conversion in so far as they had become the subject of special application to the law of"
"banks and banking. Much emphasize was laid on the fact that one party to the impugned"
"transaction was a bank."
