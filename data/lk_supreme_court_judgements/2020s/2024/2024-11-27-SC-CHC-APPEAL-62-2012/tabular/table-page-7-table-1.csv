"The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance published in the"
"Ceylon  Government  Gazette  No.  7,539  dated  July  30,  1926  states  that  it  reproduces"
"practically without alteration the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 of England which was in force"
"in  Ceylon  by  virtue  of  Section  2  of  Ordinance  No.  5  of  1852.  This  was  done  as  it  was"
"considered desirable in view of the fact that many of the District Judges are not provided"
"with the English acts. Since this obviated the need to retain Section 2 of Ordinance No. 5"
"of 1852, it was repealed by Section 97(3) of Bills of Exchange Ordinance No. 25 of 1927"
"(Bills of Exchange Ordinance)."
"However, in order to address any argument based on any omission, Section 98 (2) of the"
"Bills  of  Exchange  Ordinance  provided  that  the  rules  of  the  common  law  of  England,"
"including  the  law  merchant,  except  in  so  far  as  they  are  inconsistent  with  the  express"
"provisions of that Ordinance, or any other enactment for the time being in force, shall"
"apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques."
"Within fourteen years of the enactment of Ordinance No. 5 of 1852, a further step was"
"taken by Ordinance No. 22 of 1866 towards introducing English law principles to govern"
"other areas of commercial law matters in Ceylon."
"Governor Sir Hercules Robinson, addressing the Legislative Council on 3rd October 1866"
"[See Addresses delivered in the Legislative Council of Ceylon by Governors of the Colony,"
"Vol. 2, page 97] observed that Ordinance No. 5 of 1852 had been enacted to introduce"
"the  law  of  England  to  the  colony  in  maritime  matters  and  in  contracts  and  questions"
"arising out of bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques. Nevertheless, he declared"
"that the legislature was of the view that there were other commercial questions in which"
"it is desirable to assimilate our law with that of England such as questions relating to the"
"laws of partnership, joint stock companies, corporations, banks and banking, principals"
"and agents and  life and fire insurance.  In fact, he claimed  that  though it has not been"
"formally declared to be in force,  the English law has been for years virtually administered"
