"By clause 2 therein, the Appellant agreed with the Respondent to warrant and defend the"
"title to the demised premises."
"Clearly,  the  Appellant  gave  the  Respondent  a  warranty  of  title  as  well  as  agreeing  to"
"warrant and defend the title to the demised premises."
"These  warranties  given  on  the  date  of  execution  of  both  the  deed  of  transfer  and"
"mortgage bond run counter to the assertion of the Appellant that the Respondent was"
"under a duty to pass valid and legal title to the demised premises.  The Appellant could"
"not have warranted title to the Respondent and also undertaken to warrant and defend"
"title had the Respondent undertaken to pass good and valid title to the demised premises"
"to the Appellant. This is fatal to the claim of the Appellant that the Respondent agreed to"
"advise on the title to the demised property."
"An  important  element  of  the  advisory  claim  of  the  Appellant  is  that  the  Respondent"
"arranged notarial services for the Appellant through its lawyer Mallikaratchige Dilrukshi"
"Lalani Perera of M/s Julius & Creasy. Nevertheless, according to letter dated 05.06.2006"
"(P5), the Appellant had written to M/s Julius & Creasy requesting them to act on his behalf"
"in respect of the purchase of the demised premises in his name. Therein he has specifically"
"acknowledged  that  he  is  aware  that  M/s  Julius  &  Creasy  are  acting  as  lawyers  for  the"
"Respondent in respect of the mortgage of the demised premises to be executed by the"
"Appellant and that he has no objection to M/s Julius & Creasy acting on his behalf as well."
"The Appellant contends that this letter was prepared by the Respondent and he had no"
"choice other than to sign it as otherwise the loan would not have been granted. However,"
"he did of course have choices such as seeking independent advice from another notary"
"which he did not."
"Moreover, the attempt to assimilate the role of the said notary as that of the Respondent"
"is  factually  misconceived.  The  said  notary  was  a  member  of  the  M/s  Julius  &  Creasy"
