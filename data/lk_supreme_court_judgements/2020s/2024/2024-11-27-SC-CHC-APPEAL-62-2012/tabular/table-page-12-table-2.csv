"holding that:"
"“There  is  no  clearcut demarcation  of  the  transactions  that  one  has  with  a  Bank"

"a bank account, withdrawing money, adding interest to an account, direct debits,"
"deducting bank charges, basically any sort of activity involving a change of money"
"in an account is a banking transaction which are usually listed in a bank account"
"statement.”"
