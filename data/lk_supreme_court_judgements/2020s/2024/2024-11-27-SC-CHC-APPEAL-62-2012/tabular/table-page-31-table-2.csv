"The locus classicus on this issue is found in the speech of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest (at"
"paragraphs 502-503) who laid down as a general principle that:"
"“[…]  it  follows  and  that  it  should  now  be  regarded  as  settled  that  if  someone"
"possessed of a special skill undertakes, quite irrespective of contract, to apply that"
"skill for the assistance of another person who relies on such skill, a duty of care will"
"arise. The fact that the services is to be given by means of, or by the instrumentality"
"of, words can make no difference.  Furthermore, if in a sphere in which a person is"
"so placed that others could reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or on his"
"ability to make careful inquiry, a person takes it on himself to give information or"
"advice to, or allows his information or advice to be passed on to, another person"
"who, as he knows or should know, will place reliance on it, then a duty of care will"
"arise.”"
