"Sirimane,  J.  held  that  in  consequence  of  the  two  enactments,  Section  2  of  Civil  Law"
"Ordinance, and Section 98 (2) of Bills of Exchange Ordinance), he was of the view that in"
"all matters connected with bills of exchange a person who would be liable in English Law"
"would also be liable in Ceylon, and to that extent the English Law of conversion is part of"
"our law."
"He sought to fortify this conclusion by reference to Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance."
