"Nevertheless,  Fernando, J., did not engage in any detailed exposition of the scope and"
"ambit of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. Instead, the decisions in Hong Kong and"
"Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra) and Mitchell v. Fernando (supra) were cited with"
"approval."
"Tambiah, J. having agreed with the findings of Fernando, J. went on to examine at length"
"the question whether the English doctrine of conversion is part of our law. He concluded"
"that the English doctrine of conversion was never tacitly adopted in Ceylon and is not part"
"of our common law."
"Thereafter, Tambiah, J. went on to examine whether the English doctrine of conversion"

"of  Ceylon  v.  Kulatilleke  (supra),  Tambiah,  J.,  disagreed  with  the  reasons  given  by"
"Basnayake, CJ., in Bank of Ceylon v. Kulatilleke (supra) and concluded that despite section"
"3 of the Civil Law Ordinance, the common law of Ceylon on delict remained unaltered."
"Alles, J. agreed with the judgment of Fernando, J."
"However, none of the three justices made any detailed exposition of the scope and ambit"
"of Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. The examination of the scope and ambit of Section"

"examining the applicability of English law due to any connections with Banking matters"
"did not arise as the liability to be considered was not of a banker but of a person to whom"
"the cheque had been transferred by the forger or his agent."
"Hence, the decisions in Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank v. Krishnapillai (supra), Mitchell"
"v.  Fernando  (supra)  and  Bank  of  Ceylon  v.  Kulatilleke  (supra)  is  of  little  assistance  in"
