"retained  by  the  Respondent  to  provide  professional  advice  to  its  in  relation  to  the"
"transaction. She was also retained by the Appellant to advise him with the full knowledge"
"of the professional relationship between the said notary and the Respondent."
"In this context, the decision in Bristol & West Building Society v. Mothew [(1998) Ch 1] is"
"instructive."
"The plaintiff advanced money to a husband and wife secured by way of a first mortgage"
"on the house they were buying. The defendant solicitor, was acting on behalf of both the"
"plaintiff and the husband and wife throughout the purchasing process."
"The  loan  did  not  cover  the  entire  purchase  price  –  the  lenders  therefore  required  an"
"express  assurance  that  the  balance  would  be  supplied  by  the  purchaser’s  personal"
"finance, rather than a second mortgage loan."
"The defendant solicitor mistakenly provided this assurance, and so when the purchasers"
"defaulted  on  their  repayments  and  the  lenders  enforced  their  security  by  selling  the"
"property at a loss. The plaintiff sought to recover their whole net loss from the defendant"
"for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of trust or fiduciary duty."
"Lord Millett (at page 18) considered the position of a fiduciary who acts for two principals"
"with potentially conflicting interests without the informed consent of both and held that"
"there is a breach of the obligation of undivided loyalty. In that situation the fiduciary puts"
"himself in a position where his duty to one principal may conflict with his duty to the other"
"and described it as “the double employment rule”."
"It was held (at page 19) that the breach of the rule automatically constitutes a breach of"
"a  fiduciary  duty.  However,  Lord  Millett  went  on  to  hold  that  the  plaintiff  could  not"
"complain of this given that it was aware that the defendant was acting for the purchasers"
"when it instructed him and that was the very reason why it chose the defendant to act"
"for it. This is exactly on point with the facts of this appeal."
