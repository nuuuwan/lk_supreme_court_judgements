"Way of Necessity",""
"31.","A way of necessity can generally only be claimed when no alternative"
"","route is available to the claimant. Historically, a way of necessity is a"
"","right  of  way  granted  in  favour  of  a  property  over  an  adjoining  one,"
"","serving  as  the  only  means  of  ingress  to  and  egress  from  the  former"
"","property. Therefore, if an alternative, reasonable, and sufficient route"
"","exists, the claim fails. The key criterion for this issue is necessity, not"
"","convenience; however, it is not required to prove absolute necessity."
"32.","If a person is entitled to a reasonable and sufficient means of access to"
"","a  public  road  from  their  property,  they  cannot  claim  the  best  and"
"","nearest  route  on 
the  grounds  of  necessity 
if  another,  albeit 
less"
"","convenient, route is available. In Fernando v. Fernando 13 it was held"
"","that the plaintiff was not without other means of access to and from his"
"","land.  It  appeared  that  his  residence  was  to  the  south  of  the  land  he"
"","claimed as the dominant tenement. Daiton J. noted:"
"","""His  complaint  seems  to  be,  in  his  own  words,  that  he  has  no  easier"
"","means of access or no closer road leading to the high road other than"
"","the roadway he now claims. The gamsabhawa road joins the main road"
