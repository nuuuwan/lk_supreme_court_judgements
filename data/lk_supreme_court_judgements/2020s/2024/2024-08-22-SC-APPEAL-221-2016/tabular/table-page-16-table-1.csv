"","Defendants failed to provide definite evidence that they had been using"
"","the purported right of way as shown in plan 250/84."
"29.","The  relinquishment  or  renunciation  of  any  right  of  way  by  Hilarian"
"","Fernando  in  the  deed  of  transfer  in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff  binds  his"
"","successors,  namely 
the  Defendants. 
If 
the  owner  of  a  dominant"
"","tenement is a party to a deed which confers no right of way over the"
"","servient tenement, he must be treated to have abandoned the right of"
"","way. Such an abandonment is deliberate and intentional.  Under Section"
"","115  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  an  estoppel  will  operate  against  the"
"","Defendants 
just  as 
it  would  have  against  Hilarian  Fernando. 
  For"
"","termination 
of 
servitudes 
by 
abandonment

"30.","In the circumstances, the conclusions reached by both the District Court"
"","as well as the High Court that the defendants enjoy the right of way as"
"","of right cannot be faulted."
