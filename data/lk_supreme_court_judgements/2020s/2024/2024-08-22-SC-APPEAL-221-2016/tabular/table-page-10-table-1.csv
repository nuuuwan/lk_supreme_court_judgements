"","court statement such as an admission in an answer but filed before Court"
"","is probative of its truth against the Defendant….”."
"15.","It  is  further  noteworthy  that  the  Plaintiff's  title  deed,  marked  as  P1"
"","during  the  trial,  was  admitted  without  any  objections.  This  should  be"
"","considered  as  an  acknowledgment  of 
the  deed's 
contents,  which"
"","conferred title upon the Plaintiff."
"16.","I conclude that the learned High Court Judges correctly determined that"
"","the  Plaintiff-Respondent 
is  the  rightful  owner  of  the 
land,  thereby"
"","refuting the Defendants’ claims and affirming the Plaintiff’s entitlement"
"","to  bring  the  actio  negatoria.  Consequently,  the  arguments  that  the"
"","Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action, or that the land is co-owned,"
"","thereby granting the Defendants a right of way, are without merit. This is"
"","evidenced by the fact that the Defendants did not seriously challenge the"
"","correctness of this finding before the Supreme Court."
"17.","Having resolved the issue of title, which is a fundamental element of actio"
"","negatoria,  I  now  turn  to  the  remaining  questions:  (a)  the  nature  and"
"","scope of actio negatoria, (b) whether the Defendants have established a"
"","servitudinal 
right  over 
the  Plaintiff’s 
land, 
and 
(c)  whether 
the"
"","Defendants can claim a right of way by necessity over the Plaintiff’s land."
