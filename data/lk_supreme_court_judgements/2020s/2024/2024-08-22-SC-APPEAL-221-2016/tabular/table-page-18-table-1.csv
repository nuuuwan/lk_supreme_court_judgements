"","my  opinion  be 
impossible 
to  hold 
that 
the  plaintiff  has  shown"

"33.","A right of way of necessity cannot be granted if there is another though"
"","less convenient path along which access can be had to the public road."
"34.","In 
light  of 
the  principles  established  by  precedents,  determining"
"","whether 
an 
existing 
alternative 
route 
is  difficult  or  practically"
"","impossible to use is a question of fact that must be assessed based on"
"","the specific circumstances of each case.14"
"35.","Evidence was placed before court indicating that the Defendants have a"
"","definite right of way to their land through the premises of the bus stand"
"","as shown in the diagram above.  There is no indication that this route is"
"","prohibited  by  regulations,  nor  is  there  any  evidence  of  significant"
"","difficulties preventing the Defendants from using this alternative route."
