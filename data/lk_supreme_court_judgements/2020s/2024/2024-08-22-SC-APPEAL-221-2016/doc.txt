Factual Matrix:

1. The Plaintiff (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'Respondent')

pleaded a cause of action seeking a declaration that the Defendants

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'Appellants') are not entitled to

a right of way across the Plaintiff's land. The Plaintiff's property, as

depicted in the accompanying diagram, abuts the Colombo-Chilaw Road.

The central issue for determination is whether the Defendants have a

Page 4 of 19

legitimate right of way over the Plaintiff's land, as claimed by the

Defendants and contested by the Plaintiff.

2. The Defendants claimed a 10-foot-wide right of way across the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondents land to access their property located to the

East. The Plaintiff sought a declaration that the Defendants had no

entitlement to any such servitude over his land, while the Defendants, in

their counterclaim, asserted they had acquired a prescriptive right of

servitude. They based their claim on what they argued was their own

long-standing use of the land, as well as that of their predecessors in title.

It must be stated that the immediate predecessor in title of the

Page 5 of 19

Defendants was one Hilarian Fernando who was the husband of the 1st

Defendant and the father of the 2nnd Defendant.

3. After an extensive trial in which substantial evidence was adduced by

both parties, the trial judge, in a judgment dated May 19, 2010, ruled in

favour of the Plaintiff. The judge granted the reliefs sought in prayers (a)

and (d) of the plaint, while dismissing the Plaintiffs claim for damages

against the Defendants.

4. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Judge, the Defendant

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala. In a judgment

dated August 24, 2015, the High Court Judges of the Civil Appellate Court

affirmed the District Judges judgment of May 19, 2010.

5. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Civil Appellate Court dated August 24,

2015, the Defendant filed this instant appeal to this Court.

Appeal of the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner

6. This Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions raised by

the Defendant-Appellant.

Page 6 of 19

i. Whether the learned High Court Judges erred in law by answering

issue No. 07 in the affirmative, specifically

a) Are the Defendants using the said path across the plaintiffs land

to gain access to their property?

b) Is there an alternative right of way to access the Defendants

land?

ii. Whether the learned High Court Judge erred in law by finding that

the Appellants have an alternative road access.

iii. Whether the findings made by the learned High Court Judges are

bad in law and in fact and unsupported by evidence led at the trial.

iv. Whether the learned High Court Judges erred in law in their finding

that the Petitioners have an alternative road access.

v. Whether the findings of the learned High Court Judges are wrong.

vi. Whether the judgment of the learned High Court Judges is wrong

and/or erroneous.

Determination of Ownership of the Plaintiff and its implications for Actio

Negatoria

7. The primary argument advanced by the Defendant-Appellants before the

High Court concerned the Plaintiffs ownership of the disputed land.

Page 7 of 19

Although this specific issue was not raised before this Court, it is essential

to first establish in actio negatoria that the Plaintiff-Respondent is indeed

the legitimate owner of the land. This is crucial as the action, known as

actio negatoria, must be instituted by an owner of a land over which a

Defendant claims a servitude.

8. Before the High Court, the Defendant-Appellants contended that the

Plaintiff could not institute an actio negatoria, asserting that he had not

established his title to the land.

9. The Plaintiff's claim was based on Deed No. 2876 dated August 5, 1996,

which traced the title through a series of deeds, including a partition deed

dating back to 1917. The land had undergone multiple transactions, with

various portions being transferred over the years. The Defendant-

Appellants, the widow and daughter of Hilarian Fernando, contended

that certain transfers, particularly Deed No. 823 of 1984 in favour of

Hilarian Fernando, initiated the prescriptive period for the right of way

over the Plaintiff's land. Consequently, they argued that the Plaintiff's

claim that the Defendants cannot enjoy a right of way is unsustainable.

10. However, the learned High Court Judges correctly determined that Deed

No. 823, dated July 22, 1984, in favour of Hilarian Fernando, did not

Page 8 of 19

include a right of way in any of its schedules over any land. The mere fact

that one of the boundaries mentioned in the deed's schedules is

described as a roadway does not imply that the grantors of Deed No. 823

conferred a right of way to the grantee, Hilarian Fernando, the

predecessor in title of the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

11. Consequently, the learned judges of the Civil Appellate Court concluded

that the Plaintiffs predecessors had not fully relinquished their rights to

the land, thereby affirming that the Plaintiffs title, derived from Deed No.

2876, remains valid.

12. Furthermore, the Defendant-Appellants argued that the land was co-

owned, which they claimed granted them a right of way. However, this

assertion was rightly rejected by the High Court Judges, who determined

that all relevant co-owners had consented to the Plaintiff's deed, thereby

affirming the Plaintiff's exclusive ownership of the land.

13. Several factors further confirm the Plaintiff's ownership of the purported

servient tenement. Notably, when the Defendants pleaded in prayer (a)

to the answer that the Plaintiffs action should be dismissed because they

had established a right of way by prescription over the Plaintiffs land,

they effectively admitted that the Plaintiff is the owner of the land in

Page 9 of 19

question. This prayer to the answer serves as an explicit

acknowledgment and admission of the Plaintiff's ownership of the land

over which the Defendants claim the right of way.

14. Furthermore, it is well established that assertions or averments in

pleadings do not need to be expressly recorded as admissions to qualify

as admissions of a disputed fact. As I articulated in Mohamed Mahful

Abdul Wakeel and 2 others v Hewage Sirisena and Gunawathie and

Others1, such assertions can suffice for proof without explicit admission.

. We come across "admissions" for the first time only in Section 17 of

the Evidence Ordinance because the first exception to the hearsay rule in

the Evidence Ordinance begins from Section 17. Section 17(1) of the

Evidence Ordnance defines an admission as a statement, oral or

documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or

relevant fact. Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance deals with informal

admissions, whereas Section 58 deals with formal admissions

Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance makes it quite clear that an out of

Page 10 of 19

court statement such as an admission in an answer but filed before Court

is probative of its truth against the Defendant..

15. It is further noteworthy that the Plaintiff's title deed, marked as P1

during the trial, was admitted without any objections. This should be

considered as an acknowledgment of the deed's contents, which

conferred title upon the Plaintiff.

16. I conclude that the learned High Court Judges correctly determined that

the Plaintiff-Respondent is the rightful owner of the land, thereby

refuting the Defendants claims and affirming the Plaintiffs entitlement

to bring the actio negatoria. Consequently, the arguments that the

Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action, or that the land is co-owned,

thereby granting the Defendants a right of way, are without merit. This is

evidenced by the fact that the Defendants did not seriously challenge the

correctness of this finding before the Supreme Court.

17. Having resolved the issue of title, which is a fundamental element of actio

negatoria, I now turn to the remaining questions: (a) the nature and

scope of actio negatoria, (b) whether the Defendants have established a

servitudinal right over the Plaintiffs land, and (c) whether the

Defendants can claim a right of way by necessity over the Plaintiffs land.

Page 11 of 19

The nature and scope of Actio Negatoria

18. In Saparamadu v. Melder2 the plaintiff who had only a servitude

(not soil rights) over the disputed land had prayed "for a declaration

that the defendant is not entitled to use the road reservation .... in any

manner whatsoever".3 In other words, the Plaintiff sought a

declaration that the land in question is free from any servitude. The

court held that "such an action can only be filed by someone who has

soil rights and not by someone who himself enjoys only a servitude"4

(see paragraph at p.152).

19. This legal proposition was based on the scope of the action, as

described in Wille's Principles of South African Law, 8th Edition, p.

326, which was cited by the Court of Appeal at p. 151 of the

referenced judgment.

"If a person unlawfully claims a servitude over land or claims greater

rights under a servitude than it actually comprises, the owner of the

land may bring an action against him, known as the actio negatoria,

for a declaration that his land is free from the servitude claimed, or

2 (2004) 3 Sri.LR 148.

3 Ibid., last paragraph p. 151.

4 Ibid at p. 152.

Page 12 of 19

free from the excessive burdens as the case may be. This action can be

instituted by none but the owner of the land in question."5

20. Thus, the Court of Appeal in Saparamadu v. Melder concluded that

... in the instant case the plaintiff-respondent has prayed for a

declaration that the defendant-appellant has no right to use the right

of way in question. We are of the view that she (plaintiff) cannot have

and maintain this action in the present form against the defendant-

appellant as she has no soil rights in respect of the said road

reservation...".

21. However, His Lordship J.A.N.de Silva (as His Lordship then was)

stated at p.152 that when a person who enjoys a servitude is

obstructed, he could bring an action against the person who

obstructs to restrain him from interfering with the enjoyment of the

servitude and invoked the following passage from Willes Principles

of South African Law (8th Edition) p.325.

"If the exercise or enjoyment of the servitude be obstructed or

infringed in any respect, the holder of the servitude may by means of

5 See Willes citation of Voet 8.5.5 for judgments to support the proposition in the passage.

Page 13 of 19

actio confessorio, enforce his right or obtain other appropriate legal

redress against the offender.6

22. The holder of the servitude may in addition, claim damages for any loss

caused to him.7 Therefore, it is evident that the plaintiff in Saparamadu v.

Melder should have filed her action in the form of actio confessoria rather

than actio negatoria. The mistake lies in the fact that actio negatoria is

available to a landowner (or someone with soil rights), while actio

confessoria is available to a person who holds only a servitude without

soil rights.

23. Hall and Kellaway on Servitudes8 states that,

The actions recognised by Roman Dutch law were the actio confessoria

and the actio negatoria or contraria, the former being an action to enforce

a servitude, and the latter to declare a property free from a servitude. The

actio confessoria embraced (a) the removal of all obstructions or

replacement of anything destroyed, through which the servitude is

rendered useless (b) .... (c) .... . (Voet, 8.5.3). The actio negatoria could be

brought by an owner against anyone claiming the right to exercise a

6 Wille cites Voet 8.5.1, 8.5.2 and 8.5.3.

7 Ibid p 325.

8 See 2nd Edition at pp 315-136.

Page 14 of 19

servitude over his property for the purpose of ascertaining whether the

servitude existed".

24. Maasdorp's Institutes of South African Law9 explains that the

traditional actions, known as actio confessoria and actio negatoria or

contraria, still influence modern principles, even though the procedures

have evolved. The tome further states that the general rule is that only

the person in whose favour a servitude has been created can enforce it,

as servitudes are indivisible by nature.10

25. The questions of law raised before this Court does not call in question the

form of action that actio negatoria should take and this Court summarizes

position as follows:

Actio negatoria or contraria is an action to declare a property free from

servitude, which can only be brought by the owner or someone with soil

rights. In contrast, actio confessoria is an action to enforce a servitude,

which can only be filed by the person in whose favour the servitude has

been established.

26. I now turn to the two remaining matters that are central to the

9 Volume II at p 177

10 See page 178.

Page 15 of 19

questions of law before this Court: whether the Defendants have

established a servitudinal right over the Plaintiffs land, and whether

the Defendants can claim a right of way by necessity over the Plaintiffs

land.

Does a servitudinal right by virtue of prescription inhere in the

Defendants?

27. In the course of the judgment, I noted that Deed No. 823, dated July 22,

1984, conferred no explicit right of way on Hilarian Fernando, the

Defendants' predecessor in title, to traverse a servient tenement. When

the Plaintiff acquired title through Deed No. 2876 on August 5, 1996,

Hilarian Fernando signed as a vendor on the deed.

28. This clearly indicates that the Defendants' predecessor in title

relinquished any rights or entitlements over the land in question.

Furthermore, there is no conclusive evidence to establish that they had

been using the servient tenement for over 10 years, aside from the plan

No. 250/84, marked as Vi during the trial. The learned District Judge

explicitly stated in her judgment that the court could not rely on this

plan, as the surveyor who prepared it testified that it was drawn based

on instructions from Hilarian Fernando, the Defendants' predecessor in

Page 16 of 19

title. Consequently, the learned High Court Judge concluded that the

Defendants failed to provide definite evidence that they had been using

the purported right of way as shown in plan 250/84.

29. The relinquishment or renunciation of any right of way by Hilarian

Fernando in the deed of transfer in favour of the Plaintiff binds his

successors, namely the Defendants. If the owner of a dominant

tenement is a party to a deed which confers no right of way over the

servient tenement, he must be treated to have abandoned the right of

way. Such an abandonment is deliberate and intentional. Under Section

115 of the Evidence Ordinance, an estoppel will operate against the

Defendants just as it would have against Hilarian Fernando. For

termination of servitudes by abandonment see Nagamani v

Vinayagamoorthy11; Fernando v Mendis.12

30. In the circumstances, the conclusions reached by both the District Court

as well as the High Court that the defendants enjoy the right of way as

of right cannot be faulted.

12 14 N.L.R 101.

Page 17 of 19

Way of Necessity

31. A way of necessity can generally only be claimed when no alternative

route is available to the claimant. Historically, a way of necessity is a

right of way granted in favour of a property over an adjoining one,

serving as the only means of ingress to and egress from the former

property. Therefore, if an alternative, reasonable, and sufficient route

exists, the claim fails. The key criterion for this issue is necessity, not

convenience; however, it is not required to prove absolute necessity.

32. If a person is entitled to a reasonable and sufficient means of access to

a public road from their property, they cannot claim the best and

nearest route on the grounds of necessity if another, albeit less

convenient, route is available. In Fernando v. Fernando 13 it was held

that the plaintiff was not without other means of access to and from his

land. It appeared that his residence was to the south of the land he

claimed as the dominant tenement. Daiton J. noted:

"His complaint seems to be, in his own words, that he has no easier

means of access or no closer road leading to the high road other than

the roadway he now claims. The gamsabhawa road joins the main road

13 31 N.L.R 107.

Page 18 of 19

a little to the south of the right of way claimed. This is, therefore, a

further means of access open to him. Upon the evidence led, it would in

my opinion be impossible to hold that the plaintiff has shown

conclusively that he is entitled to the road claimed as a way of

necessity".

33. A right of way of necessity cannot be granted if there is another though

less convenient path along which access can be had to the public road.

34. In light of the principles established by precedents, determining

whether an existing alternative route is difficult or practically

impossible to use is a question of fact that must be assessed based on

the specific circumstances of each case.14

35. Evidence was placed before court indicating that the Defendants have a

definite right of way to their land through the premises of the bus stand

as shown in the diagram above. There is no indication that this route is

prohibited by regulations, nor is there any evidence of significant

difficulties preventing the Defendants from using this alternative route.

36. Accordingly, both the learned District Judge and the High Court Judges

correctly ruled in favour of the Plaintiff on the issues of prescriptive use

14 See Marasinghe v Samarasinghe 73 N.L.R 433; Mohoti Appu v Wijewardema 60 N.L.R 46; Sumangala v Appuhamy 46 N.L.R 137; Chandrasiri v Wickremasinghe 70 N.L.R. 15

Page 19 of 19

of the right of way and the way of necessity. This Court finds no reason

to interfere with those findings.

37. In the circumstances, we proceed to affirm the judgments of both the

District Court and the High Court of Civil Appeals and dismiss the

appeal of the Defendant-Respondent-Respondents. We answer the

questions of law raised before this Court in favour of the Plaintiff-

Appellant. The learned District Judge is directed to enter judgment and

decree as prayed for by the Plaintiff.
