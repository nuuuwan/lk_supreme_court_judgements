SC/APPEAL/153/2019

Samayawardhena, J.

Background

The plaintiff filed action against the defendant in the District Court of

Marawila seeking a decree of divorce on the ground of constructive

malicious desertion and custody of their four children. The defendant-

wife filed an application under section 614 of the Civil Procedure Code

dated 26.01.2006 seeking alimony pendente lite until the determination

of the divorce action and costs of litigation. After a lengthy inquiry, the

District Court by order delivered on 04.05.2017 directed the plaintiff to

pay Rs. 60,000 per mensem as alimony pendente lite. The District Court

did not order costs of litigation, possibly due to oversight. On appeal by

the plaintiff, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunegala, by judgment

dated 11.01.2018, affirmed the order of the District Court. This appeal

by the plaintiff is against the judgment of the High Court.

On 12.06.2019, this Court granted leave to appeal against the said

judgment on the question whether the amount ordered as alimony is

excessive in terms of section 614(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. At the

argument on 31.05.2023, learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff

refined this question stating that the order of the District Court is not in

compliance with the proviso to section 614(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

However, this was raised as an additional question of law.

Section 614 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

614(1) In any action under this Chapter, whether it be instituted by

a husband or a wife, the wife may present a petition for alimony

pending the action. Such petition shall be preferred and dealt with

as of summary procedure, and the husband shall be made

respondent therein; and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of

the statements therein contained, may make such order on the

5

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

husband for payment to the wife of alimony pending the action as it

may deem just:

Provided that alimony pending the action shall in no case be less

than one-fifth of the husbands average net income for the three

years next preceding the date of the order, and shall continue, in

case of a decree for dissolution of marriage or of nullity of marriage,

until the decree is made absolute or is confirmed, as the case may

be.

(2) A husband may present a petition for alimony pending the action.

The provisions of the preceding subsection shall apply, mutatis

mutandis, to such application.

(3) Where one of the spouses is not possessed of sufficient income or

means to defray the cost of litigation, the court may at any stage of

the action order the spouse who is possessed of sufficient income or

means to pay to the other spouse such sum on account of costs as it

considers reasonable.

It may be noted that subsections (2) and (3) above were introduced by the

Civil Procedure (Amendment) Law, No. 20 of 1977.

Based on section 614(1), the argument of learned Presidents Counsel for

the plaintiff (as morefully described in the post-argument written

submissions) is two-fold:

(a) The defendant did not follow the summary procedure; and

(b) The order is not based on the net income of the plaintiff for the

three years immediately preceding the date of the order.

Hence, it is argued that the order of the District Court and the judgment

of the High Court are bad in law and should be set aside.

6

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

I must state that leave was not granted on (a) above although learned

Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff has dedicated significant portion of

his post-argument written submissions on that matter.

Let me now consider both the said arguments in turn.

Failure to follow summary procedure

In terms of section 614(1), the petition shall be preferred and dealt with

as of summary procedure. The summary procedure is set out in sections

373-391 of Chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure Code.

In the instant case, admittedly, summary procedure was not followed

although the application was filed by petition and affidavit before the

District Court. After the plaintiff filed objections, the matter was fixed for

inquiry. However, halfway through the inquiry, on 22.01.2009, the Court

brought the matter of failure to adopt the summary procedure to the

attention of the parties. Both parties consented to the procedure adopted

and agreed to continue with the inquiry.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff now argues that the parties

cannot by consent follow a different procedure and the failure to follow

the summary procedure renders the whole proceedings void ab initio. I

have no hesitation in rejecting this argument.

If the Court has plenary jurisdiction to hear a case, a party who has

acquiesced in the wrong procedure being adopted cannot later raise

objections to the procedure once he realises that the order is against him.

All objections to the procedure should be raised at the earliest

opportunity before the trial Court and not in the appellate Court.

Otherwise, such objections are deemed to have been waived.

In Dabare v. Appuhamy [1980] 2 Sri LR 54 the defendant sought

dismissal of the plaintiffs action on res judicata. This was rejected by the

7

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

trial Court. On appeal, the contention of the plaintiff was that the

dismissal of his former action was invalid as the Court had followed the

wrong procedure, in that, instead of summary procedure, regular

procedure had been followed. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument

and allowed the appeal. The Court stated that notwithstanding that the

wrong procedure had been followed, the order of dismissal made by the

Court was valid since the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine

the action and the plaintiff did not take objection to the wrong procedure

being followed at that time.

In the instant case, the parties have consented to the wrong procedure

being adopted by signing the case record when they were represented by

their lawyers. Therefore, the plaintiff is estopped from taking up that

objection before this Court.

The relevancy of the income of the plaintiff for the three years

immediately preceding the date of the order

Learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff argues that the impugned

order delivered over eleven years after the application was filed, without

any evidence being produced pertaining to the plaintiffs net income for

the three years preceding the date of the impugned order, is fatally bad

and defective for non-compliance with the proviso to section 614. His

argument is that the documents marked by the defendant at the inquiry

were all beyond three years from the date of the order and therefore could

not have been taken into consideration in deciding the quantum of

alimony. I find myself unable to agree with this argument.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel presupposes that the

proviso to section 614(1) imposes conditions upon a wife seeking alimony

in a divorce action. It is not so. Prior to the Civil Procedure (Amendment)

Law, No. 20 of 1977, in terms of section 614, only the wife, whether she

8

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

was the plaintiff or the defendant, could ask for alimony from the

husband; vice versa was not possible. This proviso has been in effect

since the beginning.

The proviso to section 614(1) is not against the wife but in favour of her.

It does not impose any condition on her but rather facilitates her in

obtaining a sufficient amount as alimony from her husband. What does

this proviso say? It says alimony shall in no case be less than one-fifth of

the husbands average net income for the three years next preceding the

date of the order. This means, the alimony order must exceed one-fifth

of the husbands average net income for the three years preceding the

date of the order. This does not imply that the evidence related to income

must be limited to the earnings for the three years immediately preceding

the date of the order. If sufficient evidence has not been presented

regarding the average net income of the husband for the three years next

preceding the date of the order, the Court does not lack jurisdiction to

make an order for alimony, but the applicant is not guaranteed a

minimum amount.

In reference to the proviso to section 614(1), Dr. Shirani Ponnambalam

in her book titled Law and the Marriage Relationship in Sri Lanka, 2nd

Edition (1987), page 401 states:

When quantifying alimony pendente lite the Sri Lankan law,

following early English law practice, ensures that the alimony

awarded is in no case less than one-fifth of the husbands average

net income for the three years next preceding the date of the order.

This rule has been abolished in the English law. See P.M. Bromley,

Family Law (5th ed. London 1976) p.529, note 1.

In the instant case, for instance, the plaintiff has stated in evidence that

his monthly average net income was Rs. 75,000. If it was accepted by

9

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

Court, the Court should have ordered him to pay more than Rs. 15,000

as alimony to the wife, if the order was delivered within three years.

Assuming the defendant claims that his income later decreased to Rs.

25,000, then he would still be required to pay more than Rs. 5,000 as

alimony. Notably, the Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 5,000 mentioned above

represent the minimum payment, not the maximum. The precise amount

to be paid shall be determined by assessing the evidence led at the inquiry

in its overall context.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff that the

documents marked by the defendant are beyond three years from the

date of the order and therefore could not have been taken into account

in calculating the quantum of alimony is unacceptable. Those documents

are not obnoxious to the proviso to section 614(1).

Although, at first glance, section 614 does not explicitly require the

consideration of the financial status of the applicant-wife in ordering

alimony, our Courts have consistently taken into account the financial

status of the wife when determining the quantum of alimony. However,

this does not mean that if the wife has some income, she must use it for

litigation, and that in such circumstances, the Court lacks the power to

order alimony against the husband. It is hard to lay down fixed criteria

in the determination of the quantum of alimony pending action. The

decision shall depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each

case.

In Jeffery v. Jeffery [1949] HCA 28 at 581, the High Court of Australia

stated:

It would be wrong to lay down a rule that as long as a wife had any

means whatever she could not obtain an order for alimony pendente

lite. She is not bound to exhaust the whole of a small capital in order

10

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

to maintain herself during the pendency of a suit. Each case must

be considered in all its circumstances and particularly with regard

to the station in life and the financial position of each of the parties.

In an alimony inquiry, the Court is not required to go into the merits of

the main case. As S.N. Silva J. (as His Lordship then was) stated in

Edirippuli v. Wickramasinghe [1995] 2 Sri LR 22 at 24:

The merits of the action and the question of matrimonial fault are not

gone into at an inquiry into an application for alimony and costs

made under Section 614. If the merits are gone into at this stage it

would result in the question of matrimonial fault being determined

prior to even the pleadings are completed. The only matters at issue

in an application for alimony pendente lite are the need for financial

support on the part of the applicant spouse, that stems from the lack

of his or her income and income of the respondent spouse.

In any event, the defendant could not lead evidence on the husbands

income for the three years next preceding the date of the order, due to

reasons beyond her control. The plaintiff prolonged the inquiry by filing

various applications and appeals. The evidence at the inquiry had been

led before several judges. When an inquiry spans a decade, this is not

uncommon. Following the conclusion of the inquiry, there was a delay in

appointing a judge to deliver the order. Ultimately, the order was

delivered by a judge before whom no evidence was led. Can the defendant

be found fault with for those matters? The answer should be in the

negative. In such circumstances, the Court can invoke legal maxims such

as lex non cogit ad impossibilia (the law does not compel the performance

of what is impossible) and actus curiae neminem gravabit (the act of the

Court shall prejudice no man) to prevent injustice to a party to the action.

11

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

In the case of The Young Mens Buddhist Association v. Azeez and Another

[1995] 1 Sri LR 237, the leave to appeal application was filed before the

Court of Appeal out of time. When this was raised before the Supreme

Court, Kulatunga, J. (with the agreement of G.P.S. de Silva C.J. and

Ramanathan J.) held at 241:

I am of the view that taking into consideration all the facts, including

conditions of civil unrest which prevailed in the country and the fact

that the judgment was delivered on a date other than the date which

the Court had fixed for delivery of judgment, no lapse, fault or delay

can be attributed to the plaintiff-appellant in filling the application

for leave to appeal on 25.10.95; hence the principle lex non cogit ad

impossibilia would apply, in addition to the principle actus curiae

neminem gravabit.

The Supreme Court has reiterated this in several cases including

Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and Others [1988] 1 Sri LR 384 at 402.

The plaintiff is a successful businessman. A large number of documents

have been marked by the defendant through several witnesses to show

the plaintiffs income. Unlike a person who draws a monthly fixed salary,

it is not easy to prove someone elses business income.

It may be in that context, the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999, shifts the

burden to the respondent to show cause why the application for

maintenance should not be allowed. Section 11(1) of the Maintenance Act

reads as follows:

Every application for an order of maintenance or to enforce an order

of maintenance shall be supported by an affidavit stating the facts

in support of the application, and the Magistrate shall, if satisfied

that the facts set out in the affidavit are sufficient, issue a summons

together with a copy of such affidavit, on the person against whom

12

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

the application is made to appear and to show cause why the

application should not be granted:

In the Supreme Court case of Pushpa Rajani v. Sirisena

(SC/APPEAL/117/2010, SC Minutes of 08.05.2013) Wanasundera J.

observed:

When an application for maintenance is made before the Magistrate

with an affidavit by the Applicant, from there onwards, the

Magistrate is bound to act on the evidence before Court sworn in the

affidavit. If what is said on oath in the affidavit by the Applicant is

satisfactory and sufficient to create a prima-facie case to be tried by

the Magistrate, it is only then that the Magistrate sends the

summons. The summons tells the Respondent to show cause why

the application should not be granted. In any civil case the

summons issued directs the receiver only to file in Court the answer

to the plaint therewith and not to show cause.

Her Ladyship then concluded:

Therefore as it is mentioned in Section 11 of the Act, in the

Magistrates Court the Respondent has to show cause why the

application should not be granted. The burden of proof of his income

is cast on the Respondent and not the Applicant in such an instance.

Section 614(1) is also to a similar effect. The procedure to be adopted is

summary procedure where, upon issuance of order nisi, the husband is

required to show cause against making it absolute.

It should be borne in mind that the order for alimony is a temporary order

made until the dissolution of the marriage, and such order can also be

varied based on a change of circumstances. Hence there is absolutely no

necessity to have a long drawn out inquiry for alimony. It is unfortunate

13

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

that this inquiry has taken more than a decade due to various reasons,

including intervening appeals preferred by the plaintiff, which, according

to the defendant, were done to delay the finality of the alimony inquiry.

As a general rule, alimony inquiries must be concluded as early as

possible. If the Court thinks that the opposite party is adopting dilatory

strategies to frustrate the early conclusion of the inquiry, the Court may,

by invoking the inherent powers of the Court referred to in section 839 of

the Civil Procedure Code, issue an interim order for alimony, inducing

the parties to conclude the inquiry speedily. (cf. Aslin Nona v. Peter Perera

(1945) 46 NLR 109)

Although no evidence had been led before the judge who wrote the

alimony order, the order of the learned District Judge is a well-considered

one. The learned District Judge has analysed all the documentary and

oral evidence led at the inquiry. There is no necessity to repeat them in

this judgment. In the course of the judgment, he has inter alia stated that

notwithstanding the plaintiff is admittedly the owner of three business

establishments, he has not given correct details of his income. The

learned Judge has decided that, given the facts and circumstances of this

case, he cannot accept the plaintiffs version that he earns only Rs.

75,000 as profits per mensem. Eventually, he has come to the following

conclusion.

2003.09.19 2004.12.18 51

.

His conclusion is that the plaintiff earns more than Rs. 250,000 per

month, and therefore, the plaintiff should pay Rs. 60,000 per month as

alimony to the defendant. Despite the defendant seeking alimony and

costs of litigation separately, the learned District Judge has not ordered

costs of litigation. It is assumed that the costs of litigation are included

in this, although alimony pendente lite (governed by section 614(1) of the

Civil Procedure Code) and costs of litigation (governed by section 614(3)

of the Civil Procedure Code) are regulated by two separate provisions.

It is the submission of learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff that

the District Judges order is based on assumptions. I cannot agree. The

Court needs to arrive at findings on the evidence led at the inquiry. Such

findings are not based on assumptions. Given the facts and

circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the amount ordered is

not excessive.

Conclusion

I answer the two questions of law in favour of the defendant.

The order of the District Court pronounced on 04.05.2017 and the

judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 11.01.2018 are affirmed.

15

SC/APPEAL/153/2019

The order of the District Court should take effect from the date of the

alimony application.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
