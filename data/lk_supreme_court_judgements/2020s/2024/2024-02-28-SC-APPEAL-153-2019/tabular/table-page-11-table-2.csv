"Court,  Kulatunga,  J.  (with  the  agreement  of  G.P.S.  de  Silva  C.J.  and"
"Ramanathan J.) held at 241:"
"I am of the view that taking into consideration all the facts, including"
"conditions of civil unrest which prevailed in the country and the fact"
"that the judgment was delivered on a date other than the date which"
"the Court had fixed for delivery of judgment, no lapse, fault or delay"
"can be attributed to  the plaintiff-appellant in filling the application"
"for leave to appeal on 25.10.95; hence the principle “lex non cogit ad"
"impossibilia” would apply, in addition to the principle “actus curiae"
"neminem gravabit”."
