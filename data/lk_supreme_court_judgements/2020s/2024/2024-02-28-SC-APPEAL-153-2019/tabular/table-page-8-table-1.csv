"husband;  vice  versa  was  not  possible.  This  proviso  has  been  in  effect"

"this proviso say? It says alimony “shall in no case be less than one-fifth of"
"the husband’s average net income for the three years next preceding the"
"date of the order”. This means, the alimony order must exceed one-fifth"
"of the husband’s average net income for the three years preceding the"
"date of the order. This does not imply that the evidence related to income"

"the  date  of  the  order.  If  sufficient  evidence  has  not  been  presented"

"minimum amount."
