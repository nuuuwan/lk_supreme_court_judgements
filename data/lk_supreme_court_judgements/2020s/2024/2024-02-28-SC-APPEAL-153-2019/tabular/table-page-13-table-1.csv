"SC/APPEAL/153/2019"
"that this inquiry has taken more than a decade due to various reasons,"
"including intervening appeals preferred by the plaintiff, which, according"
"to the defendant, were done to delay the finality of the alimony inquiry."
"As  a  general  rule,  alimony  inquiries  must  be  concluded  as  early  as"
"possible. If the Court thinks that the opposite party is adopting dilatory"
"strategies to frustrate the early conclusion of the inquiry, the Court may,"
"by invoking the inherent powers of the Court referred to in section 839 of"
"the  Civil  Procedure  Code,  issue  an  interim  order  for  alimony,  inducing"
"the parties to conclude the inquiry speedily. (cf. Aslin Nona v. Peter Perera"
"(1945) 46 NLR 109)"
"Although  no  evidence  had  been  led  before  the  judge  who  wrote  the"
"alimony order, the order of the learned District Judge is a well-considered"
"one. The learned District Judge  has analysed all the documentary and"
"oral evidence led at the inquiry. There is no necessity to repeat them in"
"this judgment. In the course of the judgment, he has inter alia stated that"
"notwithstanding the plaintiff is  admittedly  the owner of three business"
"establishments,  he  has  not  given  correct  details  of  his  income.  The"
"learned Judge has decided that, given the facts and circumstances of this"
"case,  he  cannot  accept  the  plaintiffâ€™s  version  that  he  earns  only  Rs."
"75,000 as profits per mensem. Eventually, he has come to the following"
"conclusion."
