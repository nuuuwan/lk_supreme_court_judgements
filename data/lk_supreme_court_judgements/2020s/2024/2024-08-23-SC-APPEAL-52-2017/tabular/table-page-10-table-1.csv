"","inquiry  proceedings  that  were  initiated  at  the  instance  of  the  3rd"
"","Defendant  and  these  proceedings  cannot  attract  the  classification  of"
"","malicious prosecution. In my view, this case is entirely different. The"
"","plaint  does  not 
set  out  a  cause  of  action  based  on  malicious"
"","prosecution; and nowhere does it mention or even imply a prosecution."
"20.","The Plaintiff's cause of action centers on being subjected to a purported"
"","disciplinary 
inquiry,  which  allegedly 
led 
to  mental, 
social,  and"
"","economic  loss,  attributed  to  the  malicious,  negligent,  and  reckless"
"","actions of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Defendants."
"21.","In Alwis v Ahangama10  Mark Fernando., J refers to a passage where"
"","one  of  the  categories  of  wrongs  for  which  actio  injuriarum  provides  a"
"","remedy is described as 'abuse of legal procedure."
"22.","Under that category, McKerron first addresses 'malicious prosecution'"
"","and then other malicious proceedings. McKerron's inclusion of 'other"
"","malicious  proceedings'  within  the  scope  of  actio  injuriarum  as  a  civil"
"","remedy confirms that injuria is not limited to court prosecutions but"
"","extends to all types of 'proceedings."
"23.","The head of liability of “Abuse of legal procedure” establishes that an"
"","act may amount to “an injuria” even though no court “proceedings” have"
"","taken place or are in contemplation."
