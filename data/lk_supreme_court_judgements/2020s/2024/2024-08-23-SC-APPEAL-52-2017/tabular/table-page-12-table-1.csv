"Dr.U.L.A.  Majeed  in  his  “A Treatise on the Law of Delict (Tort)”"
"recognizes a wider category of civil action against public authorities15."
"The learned author observes;"
"“…. But it is not the breach of duty alone which gives rise to the cause of action,"
"but “an injury” is the suffering of pecuniary loss. The current of the decisions is"
"against  this  view,  which  finds  no  support  from  general  principles.  On  general"
"principles it is to express but a truism to say that the foundation of an action for"
"damage is not that damage has been caused, but that there has been a violation"
"of a private right resulting in pecuniary or moral damage. Injuria sine damno"
"gives a cause of action, while damnum sine injuria does not…….”"
