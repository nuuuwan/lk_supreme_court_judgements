"30.","As the learned High Court judges have determined, this is the point"
"","from  which  the  two-year  time  bar  for  the  delict  of  injuria  must  be"
"","calculated. It was on this date that the Plaintiff became aware that the"
"","disciplinary 
proceedings 
against 
him  were 
initiated  without"
"","reasonable and probable cause."
"31.","I  therefore  hold  that  the  Plaintiffâ€™s  action  is  maintainable,  being  an"
"","action in respect of an injuria allegedly committed jointly and severally"
"","by the Defendants by (a) maliciously and (b) without reasonable and"
"","probable cause, (c) by the initiation of a complaint against the Plaintiff,"
"","(d) which resulted in disciplinary proceedings against the Plaintiff and"
"","the  alleged  damage 
to  his 
reputation  and 
social  and  economic"
"","deprivations."
