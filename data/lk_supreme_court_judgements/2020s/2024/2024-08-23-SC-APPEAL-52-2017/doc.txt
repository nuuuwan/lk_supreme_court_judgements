1. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (the Plaintiff) was a

laboratory technician at the University of Colombo (the 1st

Defendant), while the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (the

2nd Defendant) was the Vice Chancellor of the said university and the

3rd Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant (the 3rd Defendant) was the head

of the Department of Biology and Molecular Biology.

2. The Plaintiff instituted this action against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants

on June 21, 2003 in the District Court of Colombo inter alia for a sum of

Rs. 5 million as damages caused by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants by

conducting a purported disciplinary inquiry against the Plaintiff.

3. The 3rd Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant (the 3rd Defendant) prior to

filing her answer, filed a motion dated February 24, 2014 and brought

to the notice of court that-

a) the plaint does not disclose a cause of action against the 3rd

Defendant

b) the plaint does not conform to the mandatory provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code

c) the plaint does not conform to the imperative provisions regarding

the pleadings in defamatory action

d) there is a misjoinder of parties and causes of action

e) the cause of action is prescribed before law

Page 6 of 14

f) the plaint does not disclose a cause of action against the 3rd

Defendant

4. The said motion had been filed in accordance with the propositions

decided in cases such as Actalina Fonseka v Fonseka 1 and Fernando

v Standard Chartered Bank.2

5. Since these were questions which the parties wanted the court to

examine as preliminary matters of law, the court agreed to have these

questions disposed of in limine.

6. The learned Additional District Judge of Colombo delivered her order

dated June 26, 2015 overruling the aforesaid objections raised by the 3rd

Defendant and decided to proceed with the trial.

7. The 3rd Defendant preferred an application for leave to appeal to the

High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province and by order dated

June 07, 2016, the learned Judges of the Civil Appellant High Court of

the Western Province refused to grant leave to appeal in the said

application.

8. It is from this order dated June 07, 2016 that the 3rd Defendant filed the

petition dated July 11, 2016 seeking leave from this court and

subsequently this court granted leave to the 3rd Defendant.

9. This court will address the key legal issues, categorized under several

headings for clarity, though some of these may overlap. It must be

admitted that some of them overlap with each other.

Whether the plaint does not confirm to the imperative provisions regarding

the pleading in defamatory actions?

10. The above question proceeds on the basis that the Plaintiff filed this

action for defamation. Whilst the 3rd Defendant submitted that the

action of the Plaintiff was based on defamation, the Plaintiff asserted

that his action was premised on malicious prosecution. The learned

High Court Judges who refused leave for the 3rd Defendant also

acknowledge that the action is one of defamation. Although the phrase

malicious prosecution is not used in the plaint, the plaint does speak

of , (Disgrace, humiliation and

mental distress).

11. In the prayer to the plaint damages have been sought for ,

(mental, social and economic loss). In the

view of the learned High Court Judges, this is an action for malicious

prosecution.

12. In my view, the Plaintiff's cause of action cannot be strictly

compartmentalized into categories such as malicious prosecution, as

Page 8 of 14

the learned High Court Judges suggested, or defamation, as argued by

the 3rd Defendant.

13. If the cause of action as set out in the plaint is for malicious prosecution

and nothing else, then the Plaintiffs action must be dismissed if he is

unable to prove a prosecution. The following cases establish that the

prosecution contemplated in the delict of malicious prosecution must

take the form of judicial proceedings. See Dissanayake v Gunaratne3,

Donis v Silva4, Kotelawala v Perera5, Saravanamuttu v Kanagasabai6

and Hathurusinghe v Kudaduraya7.

14. Moreover, McKerron in his Treatise of Law of Delict8 sets out that in

order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, the Plaintiff

must show that,

a. the defendant instituted or instigated the proceedings;

b. the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause

c. the defendant was actuated by malice; and

d. the proceedings terminated in his favour.

15. McKerron also states in a footnote to this passage that in principle, the

Plaintiff must also show either that the proceedings in question

occasioned him patrimonial loss, or that they were calculated to injure

his reputation.

16. Under these circumstances, the inclusion of reputational damage in the

plaint does not, by itself, transform the action into a defamation suit.

17. In Silva v Silva 9 it was laid down that in a case of malicious prosecution

the onus of proof is on the Plaintiff. He must prove on a preponderance

of evidence or on a balance of probabilities,

I. there was a prosecution on a charge that was false.

II. such prosecution was instituted maliciously or with animus

injuriandi and not with a view to vindicating public justice.

III. there was want of reasonable or probable cause for such action.

IV. the prosecution terminated in favour of the Plaintiff as against

the complainant.

18. Thus, in our precedents on malicious prosecution, it is well established

that the perceived notion of ensuring public justice has been

emphasized. All this shows quite unmistakably that the delict of

malicious prosecution embodies within it the institution of legal

proceedings in court.

19. This has to be contrasted with the disciplinary inquiry that was

conducted against the Plaintiff in the case. These were domestic

9 (2002) 2 Sri LR 29.

Page 10 of 14

inquiry proceedings that were initiated at the instance of the 3rd

Defendant and these proceedings cannot attract the classification of

malicious prosecution. In my view, this case is entirely different. The

plaint does not set out a cause of action based on malicious

prosecution; and nowhere does it mention or even imply a prosecution.

20. The Plaintiff's cause of action centers on being subjected to a purported

disciplinary inquiry, which allegedly led to mental, social, and

economic loss, attributed to the malicious, negligent, and reckless

actions of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Defendants.

21. In Alwis v Ahangama10 Mark Fernando., J refers to a passage where

one of the categories of wrongs for which actio injuriarum provides a

remedy is described as 'abuse of legal procedure.

22. Under that category, McKerron first addresses 'malicious prosecution'

and then other malicious proceedings. McKerron's inclusion of 'other

malicious proceedings' within the scope of actio injuriarum as a civil

remedy confirms that injuria is not limited to court prosecutions but

extends to all types of 'proceedings.

23. The head of liability of Abuse of legal procedure establishes that an

act may amount to an injuria even though no court proceedings have

taken place or are in contemplation.

10 (2000) 3 Sri LR 226 at p. 235.

24. As Mark Fernando J pointed out in Alwis v Ahangama11,

Attempts to confine the wrong to malicious prosecution as understood in the

English Law have been rejected both in South Africa and in Sri Lanka.

Watermeyer, J. said in Collins v. Minnaar12,

Now, whatever the English law may be about malicious prosecution, we must

be guided by the principles of the Roman-Dutch law, and in Roman-Dutch law

what is complained of is an injury

25. In Podi Singho v Appuhamy13 de Sampayo AJ said:

Besides, the Roman-Dutch action for injury is quite different from the English

action for malicious prosecution, and I think it is sufficient if the defendant set

the authorities in motion to the detriment of the plaintiff.

26. Wijegunatilleke v. Joni Appu14, was a case in which the trial Judge

had called the action one for malicious prosecution, and regarded it as

identical with the action of that name as known to the English law.

Schneider, A.J, observed:

The correct view of our law is that expressed by Bonser.CJ, in Haide

Hangidia v. Abraham Hamy (an unreported 1898 decision] ...

He then brought an action against the defendant in the form of an English action

for malicious prosecution. I asked what authority there is for such an action, and

none was produced. It is clear that an action on this case for injury lies. That is a

form of action free from the technicalities of the English form of action.

27. Dr.U.L.A. Majeed in his A Treatise on the Law of Delict (Tort)

recognizes a wider category of civil action against public authorities15.

The learned author observes;

. But it is not the breach of duty alone which gives rise to the cause of action,

but an injury is the suffering of pecuniary loss. The current of the decisions is

against this view, which finds no support from general principles. On general

principles it is to express but a truism to say that the foundation of an action for

damage is not that damage has been caused, but that there has been a violation

of a private right resulting in pecuniary or moral damage. Injuria sine damno

gives a cause of action, while damnum sine injuria does not.

28. Therefore, the actio injuriarum is much wider in its scope than the

malicious prosecution known to the English law. The action lies

whenever a defendant has acted dolo malo to the detriment of the

defendant. The action stands or falls on proof of malice and the plaint

formulated by the Plaintiff fulfills the requirements for an injuria.

Time-Bar

29. Related to the issue of law is the question of whether the action is time-

barred, as raised by the 3rd Defendant, citing Section 9 of the

Prescription Ordinance. The amended charge sheet was served to the

Plaintiff on 24.07.2006, and the domestic inquiry concluded on

29.07.2009. However, I do not consider these dates as the starting point

for the two-year limitation period. The University Services Appeals

Board (USAB) delivered its final decision exonerating the Plaintiff on

29.01.2013. Subsequently, the charges were quashed on that date, and

the plaint was filed on June 21, 2013.

15 See p 14

Page 13 of 14

30. As the learned High Court judges have determined, this is the point

from which the two-year time bar for the delict of injuria must be

calculated. It was on this date that the Plaintiff became aware that the

disciplinary proceedings against him were initiated without

reasonable and probable cause.

31. I therefore hold that the Plaintiffs action is maintainable, being an

action in respect of an injuria allegedly committed jointly and severally

by the Defendants by (a) maliciously and (b) without reasonable and

probable cause, (c) by the initiation of a complaint against the Plaintiff,

(d) which resulted in disciplinary proceedings against the Plaintiff and

the alleged damage to his reputation and social and economic

deprivations.

Misjoinder of Parties and Cause of Action

32. The Plaintiff has pleaded a joint and several cause of action against the

three Defendants, stemming from the same disciplinary proceedings

that the Plaintiff alleges were maliciously instituted against him. An

effective adjudication on the alleged joint and several liability can only

occur if the three Defendants are tried together. Allowing a suit to grow

out of another suit would be an abuse of process, and the ends of justice

are best served by avoiding a multiplicity of suits. As Prasanna

Jayawardena, PC. J pertinently observed in Seylan Bank PLC v. New

Lanka Merchants Marketing (Pvt) Ltd and Others

A Court should keep in mind the desirability of reducing the multiplicity of

litigation...16

33. In the circumstances, the preliminary objections raised by the 3rd

Defendant on the maintainability of the Plaintiffs action cannot be

sustained and we proceed to affirm the orders made by the Civil

16 SC Appeal 198/2014 at p24.

Page 14 of 14

Appellate Court dated 7th June 2016 and the District Court 26th June

2015. The questions of law raised before this Court are answered in

favour of the Plaintiff.

34. Accordingly, the appeal of the 3rd Defendant is dismissed and the

learned District Judge of Colombo is directed to hear and conclude the

original court action as expeditiously as possible.
