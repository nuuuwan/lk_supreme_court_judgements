"This approach is consistent with the ‘presumption of validity’ according to which"
"administrative action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a court"
"[Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC"
"295]. However, this ‘presumption of validity’ exists pending a final decision by the"
"court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn"
"in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at 156 and 161, and 173-"
