"Others [(2013) 2 SCR 125], Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ, delivering the majority judgment"
"of the Supreme Court of Canada, held at paragraph 29:"
"“The  one  [doctrine]  relevant  on  this  appeal  is  the  doctrine  of  issue  estoppel.   It"
"balances judicial finality and economy and other considerations of fairness to the"
"parties. It holds that a party may not relitigate an issue that was finally decided in"
"prior  judicial  proceedings  between  the  same  parties  or  those  who  stand  in  their"
"place. However, even if these elements are present, the court retains discretion to"
"not apply issue estoppel when its application would work an injustice.”"
