"judgment of the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions:"
"(1) The  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  failing  to  consider  that  the  Petitioner-Respondent"

"of Scrubs Division and/or very specifically it is unlawfully occupying the allotment"
"of land more fully described in the Notice to Quit, marked “K”,"
"(2) In  the  aforesaid  circumstances  the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  holding  that  the"
"Petitioner Company is entitled to the relief sought in its Petition dated 16.11.2011,"
"marked P1,"
"(3) The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Competent Authority has no authority"
"to re-issue the impugned notice to quit in view of the previous notice to quit which"
"was quashed  by the Court of Appeal. The 2nd Respondent-Petitioner states that the"
"said previous notice to quit was quashed on a different premise, namely “The Court"
"is  not  possessed  with  sufficient  material  to  determine  that  the  Land  Reform"
"Commission possessed the Scrub Estate described in the Schedule, to enable such"
"to be vested in the 1st Respondent” (vide page 5 of H3 annexed to the Petition dated"
