"Another  [(1983)  1  WLR  524  at  538-539]  where  the  court  held  that  in  proceedings  for"
"judicial review:"
"“[…] there are no formal pleadings and it will frequently be difficult if not impossible"
"to identify a particular issue which the “first” application will have decided…Further,"
"we doubt whether a decision in such proceedings, in the sense necessary for issue"
"estoppel  to  operate,  is  a  final  decision:  the  nature  of  the  relief,  in  many  cases,"
"leaves open reconsideration by the statutory or other tribunal of the matter in"
"dispute.” (emphasis added)"
