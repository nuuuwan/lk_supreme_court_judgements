"Estate” and “Scrubs Division”."
"The Court of Appeal in its judgment (at pages 4, 5) states as follows:"
"“The version of the Respondents as stated in the objections is that the land in issue"
"is the Scrub Division of Olipent Estate in Nuwara Eliya. The land was handed over"
"to the 1st Respondent by the Government Agent of Nuwara Eliya on 16.07.1979. But"
"the Respondent does not have any document to support this position. The land in"
"issue is identified by the Respondent as “Scrub Division of Olipent Division” (sic) and"
"the land that is described in the quit notice has no reference to a Olipent Division"
"and the land that was vested in the 1st Respondent by document marked G has no"
"reference to a Olipent Division……"
"“But if the land in issue was part of Pedro Estate as described in the schedule to the"
"lease  agreement  that 
land  was  not  owned  by  the  Land  Reform  Commission."
"According  to  the  document  marked,  B  the  Pedro  Estate  was  owned  by  the  Land"
"Reform Commission as at 18th June 1992. And on this basis the ownership had been"
"transferred to the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation on 18th April 1994. (vide"
"document F). The Court is not possessed with sufficient material to determine that"
"the Land Reform Commission possessed the Scrub Estate described in the schedule"
"to  enable  such  to  be  vested 
in  the  1st  Respondent.  Therefore  the  court  can"
"reasonably  conclude  that  the  1st  Respondent  had  no  authority  to  act  under  the"
"provisions of Section 3 of the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act, No. 7 of 1979"
"as amended, as the land in issue is not owned by the National Housing Development"
"Authority. The notice to quit should be issued by the competent authority. ”"
