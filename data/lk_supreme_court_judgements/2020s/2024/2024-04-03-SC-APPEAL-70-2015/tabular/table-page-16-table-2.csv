"and Another [supra., at 539] the Court quoted with approval the following passage from"
"Wade on Administrative Law [5th ed., (1982), page 246]:"
"“in  these  proceedings  the  court  ‘is  not  finally  determining  the  validity  of  the"
"tribunal’s order as between the parties themselves’ but ‘is merely deciding whether"
"there  has  been  a  plain  excess  of  jurisdiction  or  not.’  They  are  a  special  class  of"
"remedies designed to maintain due order in the legal system, nominally at the"
"suit  of  the  Crown,  and  they  may  well  fall  outside  the  ambit  of  the  ordinary"
"doctrine of res judicata. But the court may refuse to entertain questions  which"
"were or could have been litigated in earlier proceedings, when this would be an"
"abuse of legal process: and in the case of habeas corpus there is a statutory bar"
"against repeated applications made on the same grounds.” (emphasis added)"
