"These decisions are based on the statement made by Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United"
"Africa Company Limited [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172]:"
"“If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There"
"is no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void"
"without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it"
"to be so. And every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad."
"You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.”"
