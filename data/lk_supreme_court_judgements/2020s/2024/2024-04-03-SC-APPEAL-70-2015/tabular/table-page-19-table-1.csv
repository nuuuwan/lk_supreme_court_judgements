"Nevertheless, the Respondent claims that such vesting was null and void in law or was of"
"no force or avail in law, and in fact did not vest any part of Pedro Estate in the NHDA. The"
"claim is based on the assertion that as at the date of the vesting order, the LRC was not"
"the owner of the said land due to it becoming vested in the SLSPC by Government Gazette"
"(Extra Ordinary) No. 815/510 dated 21.04.1994."
"The Respondent relies on the decisions in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera (1 Sriskanthaâ€™s"
"Law Reports 164 at 168) and Bandahamy v. Senanayake (62 NLR 313) and submitted that"
"void  acts  are  destitute  of  legal  effect  and  their  validity  can  be  attacked  if  necessary  in"
"collateral  proceedings  when  it  is  sought  to  be  enforced  against  a  party.    They  can  be"
"ignored with impunity until sought to be enforced."
"These decisions are based on the statement made by Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United"
"Africa Company Limited [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172]:"
