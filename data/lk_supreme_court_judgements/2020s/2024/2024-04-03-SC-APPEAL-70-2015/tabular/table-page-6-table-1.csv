"(4) The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the 1st Respondent had failed to identify"
"the corpus, when the impugned notice to quit had identified the corpus by reference"
"to boundaries based on specific metes and bounds set out in a Plan drawn by the"
"Surveyor General’s Department bearing No. P.P. 1823. The boundaries set out in the"
"said Plan (evinced by the Schedule 1 of 2R6) are the same boundaries found in Plans"
"bearing Nos. 126N and 126L, annexed as 2R12 and 2R13 and the said boundaries"
"are also the same and identical boundaries found in the Notice to Quit marked “K”"
"annexed to the Petition. In any event clearly the onus of identifying the corpus and"
"establishing a claim in respect of the corpus is on the Petitioner-Company."
