"The Respondent pleaded that Pedro Estate situated in Nuwara Eliya became vested in the"
"Land Reform Commission (LRC) in 1975. Later, Pedro Estate with several other estates"
"were vested in the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) by order published in"
"Government Gazette (Extra Ordinary) No. 815/510 dated 21.04.1994 made under Section"
"27A of the LRC Act."
"The SLSPC granted a lease of Pedro Estate to the Respondent for a period of 53 years by"
"lease No. 448 dated 30.04.1996. Pedro Estate consists of several divisions, one of which"
"is called “Scrubbs Division” which is 164 acres 2 roods 16 perches in extent."
"By  an  order  dated  25.07.2000  made  by  the  Minister  of  Public  Administration,  Home"
"Affairs and Plantation Industries, purporting to act under Section 27A(1) of the LRC Act,"
"and published in Gazette (Extra Ordinary) No. 1145/19 dated 17.08.2000, purported to"
"vest an extent of 2.024 hectares (5 acres)  of the Scrub Estate in the National Housing"
"Development Authority (NHDA)."
"Although the Respondent has not specifically admitted that part of Pedro Estate formed"
"the corpus of this order dated 25.07.2000, it is clear that the case pleaded was that since"
"Pedro Estate ceased to be owned by the LRC by 21.04.1994, by virtue of the vesting in the"
"Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) by Government Gazette (Extra Ordinary)"
"No. 815/510 dated 21.04.1994, the Minister was not entitled to deal with Pedro Estate in"
"terms of Section 27A (1) of the LRC Act."
"Accordingly, the Respondent contended that the said vesting by order dated 25.07.2000"
"was null and void in law or was of no force or avail in law, and in fact did not vest any part"
"of Pedro Estate in the NHDA. The Respondent further contended that previously, the 1st"
"Respondent had issued a similar quit notice which was impugned by the Respondent in"
"C.A.  (Writ)  Application  No.  323/2006  (“Quit  Notice  of  26.08.2005”)  and  the  Court  of"
"Appeal had issued a writ of Certiorari quashing the said quit notice."
