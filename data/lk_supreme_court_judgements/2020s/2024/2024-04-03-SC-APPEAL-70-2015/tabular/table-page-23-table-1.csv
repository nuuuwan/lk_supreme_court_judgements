"Application No. 323/2006]. The application in C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006 was"
"filed on 20th February 2006. The Respondent did not seek a writ of certiorari to quash the"
"order  published  in  the  Gazette  (Extra  Ordinary)  No.  1145/19  dated  17.08.2000  made"
"pursuant  to  Section  27A  (1)  of  the  LRC  Act.  No  such  relief  was  sought  even  in  these"
"proceedings.  It  is  axiomatic  that  discretionary  relief  such  as  a  writ  of  certiorari  can  be"
"refused for undue delay."
"The  Respondentâ€™s  position  both  in  C.A.  (Writ)  Application  No.  323/2006  and  in  these"
"proceedings is that the 1st Respondent could not have issued any quit notice for Scrubbs"
"Division of Pedro Estate as it is owned by the SLSPC and leased to the Respondent in 1994"
"and  therefore  the  NHDA  did  not  get  title  by  the  order  published  in  the  Gazette  (Extra"
"Ordinary) No. 1145/19 dated 17.08.2000 made pursuant to Section 27A (1) of the LRC Act."
"Thus, the title of the NHDA to issue the impugned Quit Notice of 26.08.2005 and Quit"
"Notice of 19.11.2011 in C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006 and in these proceedings"
"respectively were core issues in both proceedings. Therefore, that issue could not have"
"been  and  cannot  be  impugned  in  C.A.  (Writ)  Application  No.  323/2006  and  in  these"
"proceedings.  An 
issue 
is  not  collateral 
if 
it 
is  the  central 
issue  to  be  decided  [See"
"Wandsworth LBC v. Winder [(1985) AC 461]."
"For the foregoing reasons, I reject the contention of the Respondent that the validity of"
"the order published in the Gazette (Extra Ordinary) No. 1145/19 dated 17.08.2000 made"
"pursuant to Section 27A (1) of the LRC Act can be impugned in these proceedings by way"
"of collateral challenge."
"In  any  event,  since  the  Respondent  has  failed  to  establish  that  the  corpus 
in  this"
"application is part of the land leased to the  Respondent, the necessity to consider the"
"validity  of  the  order  published 
in  the  Gazette  (Extra  Ordinary)  No.  1145/19  dated"
"17.08.2000 made pursuant to Section 27A (1) of the LRC Act does not arise."
