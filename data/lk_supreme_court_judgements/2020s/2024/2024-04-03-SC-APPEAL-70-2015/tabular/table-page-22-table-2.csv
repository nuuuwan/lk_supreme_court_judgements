"Accordingly,  the  contention  of  the  Respondent  that  there  was  no  need  to  impugn  the"
"order  published  in  the  Gazette  (Extra  Ordinary)  No.  1145/19  dated  17.08.2000  made"
"pursuant  to  Section  27A(1)  of  the  LRC  Act  vesting  the  corpus  in  issue  on  the  NHDA  is"
"misconceived in law."
"The Respondent sought to overcome this legal impediment by contending that the said"
"order can be impugned in collateral proceedings.  Reliance was placed on a judgment of"
"mine 
in  the  Court  of  Appeal 
in  McCallum  Brewing  Company  (Private)  Limited  v."
"Commissioner General of Excise and Another [C.A. Writ 469/2008, C.A.M. 18.12.2019]"

"collateral challenge."
"Our attention was further invited to Administrative Law: Text and Materials [Beatson,"

"Nevertheless, the question of collateral challenge does not arise in the circumstances of"
