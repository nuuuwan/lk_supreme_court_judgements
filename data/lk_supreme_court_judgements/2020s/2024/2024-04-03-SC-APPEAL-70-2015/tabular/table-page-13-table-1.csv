"Confronted with the dilemma created by the use of two different names, i.e. Scrub Division"
"of Oliphant Estate or Pedro Estate, to identify the corpus, the Court of Appeal considered"
"both positions."
"As for Scrub Division of Oliphant Estate, it was held that there is no document showing"
"the vesting of title to the said land on the 1st Respondent. Moreover, Court observed that"
"the land described in the Quit Notice of 26.08.2005 has no reference to an Oliphant Estate."
"Should the corpus be part of Pedro Estate, Court held that the LRC did not have any title"
"to pass on to the 1st Respondent as it was transferred to the SLSPC on 18th April 1994."
"Res Judicata/Estoppel"
"The Respondent contends that no appeal was lodged against the judgement delivered in"
"C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006 and as such the said judgment is final and binding"
"on all the parties. The Court of Appeal appears the proceed on the basis that the Quit"
"Notice of 19.11.2011 is null and void and could not have been issued in view of the above"
"findings by the Court of Appeal in C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006."
"The crux of this contention is that the issue is res judicata or alternatively there is issue"
"estoppel as the Quit Notice of 19.11.2011 impugned in these proceedings is the same as"
"Quit Notice of 26.08.2005 quashed in C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006."
"In Jayantha Ralalage  Ranmenika and  Another v. Kiribandage Yogarathne and Others"
"[C.A. Appeal No. 471/2000(F), C.A.M. 23.09.2019] I had to consider the applicability of"
"issue estoppel in Sri Lanka and concluded that as issue estoppel is part of English Law of"
"Evidence in civil cases,  it is part of  our law in civil cases in view of section 100 of the"
"Evidence Ordinance. Nevertheless, it must be considered whether proceedings for judicial"
"review is a civil case in that sense."
