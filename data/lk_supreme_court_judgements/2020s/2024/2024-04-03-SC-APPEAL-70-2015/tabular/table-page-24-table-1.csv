"The evidence establishes that the corpus was vested in the 1st Respondent in 2000. This"
"was to be used for a housing project for the members of the 2nd Respondent-Appellant"
"(“Appellant”)."
"According to the documentation filed by the Appellant, this housing project originated in"
"1979. The name Oliphant Estate appears to have been used at that time to identify the"
"corpus. On 16.07.1979, the Divisional Secretary of Nuwara Eliya handed over possession"
"of the corpus to the District Manager of the 1st Respondent as evinced by the handing"
"over document marked 2R2f."
"Subsequent to possession being taken over, the District Manager of the 1st Respondent"
"informed the 1st Respondent by letter dated 17.07.1979 that the possession of the corpus"
"was  taken  over  by  him  and  that  until  such  time  construction  of  the  housing  project"
"commences there is no necessity to employ security guards for the land as it was agreed"
"to  allow  the  SLSPC  to  continue  to  harvest  tea  from  the  corpus  and  manage  it  until"
"commencement of the construction of the housing project. This explains the reason for"
"the Respondent to remain in possession of the corpus which was formally vested in the"
"1st Respondent in 2000. I  may add  that  most of  this  evidence was not available to the"
"Court of Appeal in C.A. (Writ) Application No. 323/2006."
"On  the  evidence  before  us,  the  1st  Respondent  was  the  owner  of  the  corpus  and  was"
"empowered by the Act to issue the impugned Quit Notice of 19.10.2011."
"For the foregoing reasons, questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 are answered in the affirmative."
"Accordingly, the judgement of the Court of Appeal dated 02.09.2013 is set aside and the"
"application dismissed."
