"The  petitioner  was  twenty  three  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  incident  and  was  a"
"student of the ‘City School of Architecture’.  It was stated that he was an ‘Ordinary rating’ in"
"the Sri Lanka Volunteer Naval  Force and a member of the water polo team  of the Sri Lanka"
"Navy."
"Further,  an  exhibition  was  organized  by 
the  Sri  Lanka 
Institute  of  Architects  at 
the"
"Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Center (hereinafter referred to as ‘BMICH’)"
"from 
the  22nd 
to  26th  of  February,  2012.  The  petitioner  stated 
that 
the  City  School  of"
"Architecture at which he was studying had a stall at the said exhibition and the petitioner was"
"one  of  the  students  in  charge  of  the  said  stall.  The  petitioner  further  stated  that  during  the"
"exhibition he and the other students who were working at the stall entered and exited BMICH"
"through ‘Gate No 03’ on a pass issued by the management of the BMICH."
"The  petitioner  stated  that  the  exhibition  ended  at  10.00  p.m.  on  the  26th  of  February,  2012."
"Thereafter, the petitioner along with two of his friends, loaded part of the equipment from their"
"stall into the lorry belonging to the petitioner’s father and left BMICH along with another lorry"
"carrying equipment from their stall through Gate No. 03."
"After  the  goods  were  unloaded,  both  vehicles  returned  to  BMICH  to  collect  the  rest  of  the"
"equipment  from  the  stall  as  the  management  of  BMICH  wanted  the  equipment  cleared  out"
"before the next day. Thereafter, the other lorry entered BMICH through Gate No. 03 ahead of"
"the petitioner’s lorry."
"However, when the petitioner attempted to follow the other lorry into the said premises, he was"
"stopped  at 
the  gate  by 
the  1st  respondent.  The  petitioner  stated 
that  he  showed 
the  1st"
"respondent  a  pass  and  his  student  identity  card  issued  by  the  City  School  of  Architecture."
"However,  the  1st  respondent  refused  to  allow  the  petitioner  to  enter  the  premises  with  that"
"particular  pass.  Hence,  the  petitioner  parked  his  lorry  on  the  side  of  the  road  and  got  down"
"from it and walked in through the gate. Thereafter, he gave a telephone call to the management"
"of the City School of Architecture to inform them of the refusal by the 1st respondent to take"
"his lorry inside BMICH."
"While 
the  petitioner  was  attempting 
to  contact 
the  management  of 
the  City  School  of"
"Architecture,  he  observed  that  the 1st respondent  was  walking  towards the conference center."
"The petitioner further stated that while he was on the telephone, the 1st respondent came back"
"and closed the gate preventing the petitioner from leaving the BMICH compound."
