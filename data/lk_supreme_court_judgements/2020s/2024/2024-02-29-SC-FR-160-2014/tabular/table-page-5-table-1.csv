"they  did  not  know  the  reason  for  it.  Then,  the  4th  respondent  slapped  one  of  the  petitioner’s"
"friends and asked them to leave if they did not know what happened."
"Thereafter, the petitioner stated that his legs and hands were untied and he was pushed into the"
"rear portion of the jeep. Further, he stated that the 4th respondent had sat in the front seat of the"
"jeep.  Furthermore, the 2nd respondent and the unidentified person wearing a black t-shirt got"
"into the back of the jeep with the petitioner."
"The petitioner further stated that he was taken to the Cinnamon Garden Police Station where"
"the 2nd respondent held the petitioner by the neck and dragged him into the Police Station and"
"the 4th respondent followed them into the Police Station."
"At  the  Minor  Offences  Branch,  the  2nd  respondent  pushed  the  petitioner  to  the  floor  and"
"ordered him to sit on the floor. Thereafter, an unknown policeman approached him and pointed"
"a gun at him, asking the respondents “why did you bring him here? You should have killed him"
"there  itself”  and  then  trampled  the  right  hand  of  the  petitioner  with  his  shoe.  The  petitioner"
"further  stated  that  the  said  policeman  slapped  him  on  the  face.  The  petitioner  heard  the  2nd"
"respondent saying “don’t hit him now. We have already assaulted him well. We will take care"
"of him later tonight”."
"Thereafter,  the  Principal  of  the  City  School  of  Architecture  arrived  at  the  Police  Station  and"
"spoke to the petitioner on the events that took place and the petitioner who was in extreme pain"
"told him with the greatest difficulty what had transpired. The principle then spoke to the police"
"officers who were at the Police Station and left. The petitioner’s parents were informed of his"
"plight by his friends and they arrived at the police station. However, when his parents arrived,"
"he was in a semi-conscious state and was unable to speak to them."
"Afterwards, the petitioner vaguely remembered hearing that he was to be taken to the J.M.O."
"and was lifted and put into a vehicle where his father was also present. He stated that he was"
"then  taken  to  a  doctor.  However,  he  did  not  examine  the  petitioner  but  gave  a  ‘chit’  to  the"
"police officer to have the petitioner admitted to the hospital. The petitioner stated that he had"
"no recollection of the events that took place later that night and he was informed by his parents"
"that  he  was  taken  to  the  Colombo  National  Hospital  where  he  was  admitted  to  the  ‘accident"
"ward’. The petitioner further stated that he remembers being on a trolley to which one of his"
"hands was handcuffed and two policemen were guarding him."
