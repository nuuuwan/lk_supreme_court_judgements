"The  1st  respondent  filed  objections  and  stated  that  he  was  a  Police  Sergeant  working  at  the"
"Police  Station  at  BMICH.  He  further  stated  that  it  is  an  important  location  where  special"
"security is needed and therefore, a separate police post was established at the BMICH premises"
"in order to guard the said premises. It was also stated that stringent traffic controlling measures"

"The 1st respondent stated that on the 26th of February, 2012 he assumed duty  at ‘Gate No. 3’"
"situated at Sarana Road, Colombo 07 at around 10.00 p.m. He further stated that since it was"
"the  final  day  of  the  said  exhibition,  Gate  No.  3  was  allocated  to  the  vehicles  which  were"
"coming to clear the goods brought inside for the said exhibition and a large number of heavy"
"vehicles were lined up outside the said gate to enter the BMICH premises."
"Due  to  security  reasons  and  space  available  within  the  premises,  only  a  limited  number  of"
"vehicles  were  allowed  to  enter  the  premises  at  a  given  time.  Thus,  the  vehicles  which  were"
"lined  up  outside  Sarana  Road  were  allowed  to  enter  the  BMICH  premises  after  departure  of"
"vehicles which were inside the premises."
"The  1st  respondent  further  stated  that  when  he  assumed  duties,  there  was  a  long  queue  of"
"vehicles including lorries, trucks and cabs outside the gate which were waiting for their turn to"
"enter the premises and he was controlling the vehicle inflow to the BMICH premises where he"
"allowed  the  vehicles  to  enter  according  to  the  order  in  the  queue.  He  further  stated  that  the"
"entrance of the gate was always kept clear in order to allow the vehicles to exit the premises."

"would not be blocked for the exiting vehicles."
"However, during this time the petitioner came in his lorry disregarding the queue and stopped"
"the  lorry  in  front  of  the  gate  and  blocked  the  entrance.  The  petitioner  then  informed  the  1st"
"respondent  to  allow  him  to  take  his  vehicle  inside  the  said  premises.  At  that  time,  the  1st"
"respondent  informed  the  petitioner  that  he  could  not  be  allowed  to  enter  the  said  premises"
"disregarding  the  others  in  the  queue,  as  they  were  waiting  for  a  long  time  to  enter  the  said"
"premises. Hence, the petitioner was ordered to join the queue of the vehicles waiting to enter"
