Decided on : 29th of February, 2024

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and set

aside the judgment of the District Court dated 6th of September, 2000.

The 2nd Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd plaintiff) along

with the 1st plaintiff (now deceased) and the 3rd Plaintiff filed the above style action in the

6

District Court of Bandarawela as trustees of the Dassanayake Trust against the 1st Defendant-

Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 1st defendant), the 2nd defendant(now

deceased) and three other defendants inter alia, praying for ejectment on the ground of

subletting the premises described in the schedule to the plaint.

In the plaint dated 29th of August, 1988, the plaintiff pleaded that without their written consent

the 1st defendant sublet the premises, at No. 9, Thambipilliai Avenue, Haputale described in

the schedule to the plaint to the 2nd to 5th defendants in January, 1998.

The 1st and 2nd defendants filed an answer and denied the allegation of subletting the premises.

It was pleaded that the 2nd defendant was the brother-in-law of the 1st defendant, and the 3rd to

5th defendants were unknown and fictitious persons. Accordingly, the 1st and 2nd defendants

prayed for the dismissal of the plaint with costs.

Summons could not be served on the 3rd to 5th defendants and therefore, the action against them

was withdrawn by the plaintiffs. Hence, the District Court made an order to proceed only

against the 1st and 2nd defendants.

Moreover, the said house had five rooms, and is subject to the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972. Further,

the 2nd defendant who is the brother-in-law of the 1st defendant was also occupying the premises

in suit with his family.

After an inter-parte trial, the learned District judge delivered the judgment and dismissed the

plaint. In the said judgment it was inter alia held that the plaintiff has not proved the case on a

balance of probability.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal. After

hearing the appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the District Court and allowed

the appeal by judgment dated 29th November, 2013. In the said judgment, the Court of Appeal

held inter alia;

During the cross examination of the 1st Respondent, the Appellant has

produced a certified copy of the Electoral Register marked P5. According to

P5, the 1st Respondent was the chief house holder of premises No. 705A

Railway Station RoadSaid evidence has clearly shown that during the period

relevant to this action, the 1st Respondent was not in occupation of the premises

in suit, i.e., No. 09 Thambipillai Mawatha, Haputale. Also it was crystallised

7

that the 1st Respondent was in occupation of the premises No. 705A, Railway

Station Road.

When I consider the said evidence it is my considered view that the Appellants

has led sufficient prima facie evidence to establish that there was subletting by

proof of the fact that 2nd defendant was in the premises attend to his own work

and that 1st Respondent appeared to have relinquished his control of the

premises

At the trial, the 2nd Respondent has not given evidence. Therefore, it seems that

the Respondents have not only failed to challenge the evidence of the

Appellants but also to corroborate the evidence of the 1st Respondent. In the

said circumstances it can be concluded on a balance of probability that the 1st

Respondent has sublet the premises in suit to the 2nd Respondent

Furthermore it was held by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal, who stated;

the Appellants has led sufficient prima facie evidence establishing that

there was subletting by proof of the fact that the 2nd defendant was in the

premises attend to his own work and that 1st respondent (Appellant)

appeared to have relinquished his control of the premises. The burden must

then necessarily shift to the 1st Respondent to explain the presence of the 2nd

Respondent

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 29th of November, 2013

the defendants sought Special Leave to Appeal and this court granted Special Leave to Appeal

on the following questions of law:

(a) Has the Court of Appeal gravely erred in regard to its evaluation of the evidence in

this case particularly in relation to P5 and P6?

(b) Is there any evidence in this case to establish that the 1st defendant can in law be

considered to have sublet the premises in suit or a part thereof to the 2nd defendant?

8

Has the 1st defendant sublet the premises in suit or part of it?

The 2nd plaintiff gave evidence at the trial and stated that his deceased father and his sister, the

deceased 1st plaintiff, gave the said premises on rent to the 1st defendant. Further, he had visited

several times to see the premises in suit.

He further stated that when he went to the said premises along with his sister who is the 1st

plaintiff in January 1988, the 1st defendant was not in the said premises. However, the 3rd, 4th

and the 5th defendants were occupying two rooms of the said premises. Further, all the other

rooms in the home were occupied by the 1st defendant, and the 2nd defendant and his family.

Moreover, the 1st plaintiff spoke with the 3rd to 5th defendants, the female Tamil teachers who

were residing in the premises, who said that they were residing in that home, and that they paid

the rent to the 1st defendant.

Moreover, the plaintiffs produced the Electoral Register for the occupants of the house No.

705A, Station Road, Haputale, in order to establish that the 1st defendant had ceased to occupy

the premises in suit.

The 1st defendant gave evidence and said that the premises were let out to him in 1979 by the

1st plaintiff. He stated that the house at Railway Station Road, Haputale was his fathers house

and that it was given to his elder brother. Hence, he took the premises in suit on rent.

The 1st defendant further stated that he occupied the premises in suit with his mother, his

younger sister and her husband who is the 2nd defendant. In the circumstances, he denied that

he sublet the said the premises to his brother-in-law, the 2nd defendant or to anyone else.

The 1st defendant admitted under cross-examination that he went to Saudi Arabia for

employment in 1982 and had returned in 1984. Thereafter, once again he went to the said

country in 1993 and returned in 1994. The 1st defendant stated that he paid the rent and that his

younger sister or her husband made no payment whatsoever.

He further stated that he was not occupying his fathers house at No. 50/1, Railway Station

Road, Haputale until 1979. He also stated that his father died in 1978 and thereafter, his elder

brother has been residing in that house with his sisters. However, the 1st defendant admitted

that his name was registered in the Electoral Registers for the house at No. 50/1 Railway Station

Road, Haputale.

Analysis

The 1st defendant stated that the 2nd defendant was married to his sister and that they were

occupying the premises in suit. Although the 1st Defendant had taken up the position that after

1979, he was not residing in the house at No. 50/1, Railway Station Road, Haputale, because

his brother got that house from the father, the Electoral Register showed that his name appeared

as the Chief Occupant of the said house in the year 1988 along with the 2nd defendant and two

others. It is pertinent to note that the summons in the case was served by the process sever on

the 1st defendant at No. 50/1, Railway Station Road, Haputale. Further, the caption of the plaint

refers to the said address as the address of the defendant.

The oral testimony of the 2nd plaintiff, established that in addition to the 1st defendant there was

at least one other family occupying the premises. Further, the 2nd plaintiff produced the

Electoral Register to show that the 1st defendant was residing at No. 50/1, Railway Station

Road, Haputale. Hence, the burden was shifted to the 1st defendant to explain the nature and

the mode of occupancy of the 2nd defendant. A similar view of the burden of proof was

discussed in Sangadasa vs. Hussain and Another [1999] 2 SLR 395 where it was held;

"It is sufficient for a landlord to establish a prima facie case of subletting and

the burden them shifts to the tenant to explain the nature of the occupation of

the alleged subtenant

However, the learned District Judge held that the plaintiff did not prove its case. As stated

above, the plaintiffs established a prima facie case that the 1st defendant has sub-let the house

to the 2nd defendant and his family. Hence, the learned District Judge erred in law when he held

that the plaintiff did not prove the case. It is pertinent to note that the Court of Appeal correctly

held that the 1st defendant has sub-let part of the premises to the 2nd defendant. Thus, I am of

the view that the Court of Appeal is correct in coming to the aforementioned finding after

considering the evidence led at the trial. Accordingly, I answer the following questions of law

as follows;

10

(a) Has the Court of Appeal gravely erred in regard to its evaluation of the evidence in this

case particularly in relation to P5 and P6?

No

(b) Is there any evidence in this case to establish that the 1st defendant can in law be

considered to have sublet the premises in suit or part thereof to the 2nd defendant?

Yes

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The District Court judgment is affirmed. No costs.
