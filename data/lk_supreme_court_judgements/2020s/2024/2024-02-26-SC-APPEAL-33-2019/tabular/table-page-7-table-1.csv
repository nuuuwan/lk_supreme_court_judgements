"","Section 23 of the present Judicature Act is similar to the provisions"
"","contained in section 73 of the repealed Courts Ordinance. Section 23"
"","occurs in Chapter IV of the Judicature Act which spells out the civil"
"","jurisdiction  of  the  District  Courts.  In  my  opinion  section  23  of  the"

"","or orders of the District Court made in the exercise of its ordinary,"
"general,  civil","jurisdiction  and  has  no  application  to  the  special"
"","jurisdiction conferred on the District Court as in the instant case. As"
"","already  stated,  the  jurisdiction  exercised  by  the  District  Court  in"
"","terms of sections 72(7) and 72(8) of the Act is the jurisdiction of a"
"","Court of execution in respect of an extra judicial order. It is basically"
"","not different from the jurisdiction exercised by the Magistrate’s Court"
"","in proceedings for the recovery of taxes in default under the Income"
"","Tax Ordinance. It is settled law that there is no right of appeal from"
"","an order made by a Magistrate’s Court in such proceedings – vide"
