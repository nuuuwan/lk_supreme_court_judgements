1. The Petitioner, namely, Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Petitioner) filed this application on 10th January 2019 against the Respondents

above named seeking relief in respect of the alleged infringement of his fundamental

rights guaranteed by and under the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, on 27th May 2019, when the case was called for support, and

having heard both Counsel on their respective cases, the Court granted leave to proceed

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 20

for the alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution in the manner and

circumstances hereinafter described.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2. The narration of the events by the Petitioner and the Respondents leading up to the

instant fundamental rights application is as follow.

3. In accordance with the agreement executed on or about July 1991, the Petitioner was

assigned quarters bearing No. 2 (upstairs), Park Lane, Off-Park Road, Colombo 05,

with a floor area of 1100 sq. feet as designated official housing for a Public Health

Department Medical Officer employed by the Colombo Municipal Council (hereinafter

referred to as the "1st Respondent Council"). This is documented in R1, appended to

the Statement of Objections filed by the 1st, 3rd to 6th Respondents on 15th July 2019

(hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement").

4. Similarly, on or about 27th October 1992, the premises directly below the Petitioner's

aforementioned quarters were designated as official housing for another qualified

officer appointed as a Medical Officer in the 1st Respondent Council's Public Health

Department. This allocation pertains to quarters bearing No. 4, Park Lane, Off-Park Road,

Colombo 05.1

5. Effective 23rd March 2000, the Petitioner was promoted to Chief Medical Officer.

Following the Petitioner's appointment and the subsequent vacancy of quarters bearing

No. 4, Park Lane, Off-Park Road, Colombo 05, a formal request was submitted by the

Petitioner on 28th February 2003, addressed to the Municipal Commissioner of the 1st

Respondent Council, seeking temporary consolidation of the Petitioner's existing

1 vide Exhibit R2, appended to the Statement of Objections dated 15 July 2019

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 20

residence (quarters bearing No. 2 , upstairs) with the vacant quarters bearing No. 4

extending the floor area.

6. For such consolidation, structural modifications were undertaken, including the

construction of a staircase to physically connect the two units. The Petitioner states that,

as this structural change was temporary in nature, it was never sent to the Mayor or

Council for approval. Moreover, there had been an audit query by the Government Audit

Superintendent of the Auditor Generals Department of Sri Lanka regarding the

Petitioner utilizing two quarters with an aggregate floor area of 2200 sq. ft. However,

the Council had replied favourably towards the Petitioner stating, inter alia, that he was

holding an important position and that he was entitled to a larger floor area than what

was originally assigned to him.

7. These combined quarters (henceforth referred to as the "official living quarters") had

subsequently served as the duly approved residence for the Chief Medical Officer from

1st July 2003, for a period of eleven years. Notably, recognition of these quarters as the

"scheduled quarters" for the Chief Medical Officer position was established under Clause

1.1 of Chapter XIX of the Establishments Code.

8. On 02nd May 2014, a formal request for the allocation of the subject premises as official

living quarters was submitted by Dr. (Mrs.) A. Kariyawasam, the then Deputy Chief

Medical Officer of Health (Laboratory Services) and the wife of the Petitioner (henceforth

referred to as "Petitioner's wife"). This request, addressed to the Chief Medical Officer

(at the time, the Petitioner), sought occupancy effective from 15th May 2014, with salary

deductions for related rentals.2

dated 15 July 2019

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 20

9. A review of this letter reveals a subsequent Minute, dated 5th May 2014, penned by the

Petitioner, instructing the Assistant Secretary and First Clerk ("AS/FC") to "take necessary

action to transfer" the premises as requested by his wife. This instruction was duly

implemented.

10. Upon retirement on 20th May 2014, the Petitioner was obligated to vacate the official

living quarters as per the agreement with the 1st Respondent Council. However, the

Petitioner did not vacate the said premises.

11. Meanwhile, the Respondents had initiated the Petitioner's pension process with the

Department of Pensions, forwarding necessary documents and requesting a pension

number in November 2014. The Petitioner states that he completed the forms in respect

of his pension around this time, following which a commuted pension of Rs.

1,250,971.06 was deposited into his People's Bank account in January 2015. Petitioner

contended these actions of requiring him to fill out fresh forms be a calculated move to

delay the payment of his pension.3

12. Moreover, the Petitioner's wife's request to transfer the official living quarters to her

name was ultimately denied by the Standing Committee on Pensions, Gratuities, E.P.F.,

Pension Allowance, and Employees Welfare Activities of the 1st Respondent Council. This

decision, reached on 16th February 2015, was duly communicated to both the Petitioner

and his wife. Despite being informed of this formal rejection, the Petitioner and his wife

continued to occupy the aforementioned official living quarters.

13. The Respondents submitted in their Written Submissions dated 17th January 2024 that

a policy decision was made at the Council's 27th June 2013 General Meeting (Item No.

960) to withhold pension and gratuity payments until occupants vacate official quarters.

This policy, of which the Petitioner (Chief Medical Officer of the 1st Respondent Council's

3 Petition of the Petitioner dated 10 January 2019, para 59

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 20

Public Health Department) was allegedly aware, aimed to incentivize timely

relinquishment of housing. Furthermore, the Respondents cited a letter dated 29th April

2016 from the Auditor General criticizing the 1st Respondent Council's inaction. The

letter refers to Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of Chapter XIX, Establishments Code, which

empower the Council to evict occupants and deduct "penal rent" from salaries and

pensions for unauthorized occupancy.

14. In response to the aforementioned audit query and in accordance with the provisions

of the Establishment Code, the Respondents calculate a "penal rent" of Rs. 8,018,751.27

for the Petitioner's unauthorized occupancy of the Chief Medical Officer's quarters from

20th November 2014, to 11th September 2018. This sum reflects deductions from the

Petitioner's salary at an 8% rate. To legally pursue the recovery of possession, the 1st

Respondent Council, acting in accordance with Section 3 of the Local Authority Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978, issued a "Notice to Quit" dated 05th

February 2015 to the Petitioner.4

15. The Petitioner states in paragraph 33 of his Petition that he preferred an appeal dated

29th August 2016 to the Minister of Provincial Council and Local Government, Mr. Faizer

Mustapha, in terms of Section 4 of the Local Authorities Recovery of Quarters Act [sic]5

with the view of getting the quarters transferred to his wife.6 The Petitioner further states

that the honourable Minister then informed the Petitioner that his wife could stay until

retirement and that the Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial

Councils assured that no action would be taken by the Municipal Commissioner.

However, no proof of these purported statements of assurances has been adduced

before this Court.

6 The Appeal produced marked P31 appended to the Petition of the Petitioner.

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 20

16. Despite receiving the "Notice to Quit," the Petitioner refused to vacate the premises.

Consequently, the 2nd Respondent, in accordance with Section 6 of the Local Authority

Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978, initiated legal proceedings in the

Colombo Magistrate's Court.7 On 18th January 2017, the court ordered the Petitioner's

eviction. While the 2nd Respondent attempted to execute this order, the Petitioner and

his wife resisted by locking the quarters. The Petitioner states that he then obtained an

interim order from the Court of Appeal staying the operation of the order of the learned

Magistrate.8 Thereafter, the Petitioner and his family continued their occupancy until

11th September 2018, even after his wife's retirement on 06th July 2018.

17. Despite continuous inquiries from the 1st Respondent Council regarding vacating the

official quarters for pension processing, the Petitioner persisted in occupancy for nearly

four years. Finally, on 11th September 2018, the Petitioner communicated his readiness

to surrender the premises and handed over vacant possession of the same. It is after

this handover the Petitioner inquired about his pension via a letter dated 03rd October

2018. Notably, prior inquiries regarding pension payments were made in September

and October 2015, followed by a period of silence until the premises were vacated.

18. In his petition, the Petitioner asserted that an amount of Rs. 3,075,000 is due for the

failure to disburse pension payments since the Petitioner's retirement date for a period

of four and a half years.

19. The position of the Petitioner was that Petitioners pension cannot be reduced or

withheld in terms of the Minutes on Pensions No. 12(1) before the conclusion of a

disciplinary inquiry. In light of these submissions, the Counsel for the Petitioner in their

7 Case No. D 65810/05

8 Order dated 04 April 2017 of Case bearing No. CA 119/2017 Writ produced marked P33 appended to the Petition of the Petitioner. This Case bearing No. CA 119/2017 Writ was subsequently withdrawn on 10 September 2018.

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 20

written submissions dated 17th November 2021 alleged that Petitioners fundamental

rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) have been violated. However, I must

point out that, when the matter was supported on 27th May 2019, leave was granted

only on Article 12(1).

ANALYSIS

20. The Petitioner's breach of contractual obligations regarding the relinquishment of his

official quarters upon retirement is evident through a series of actions spanning several

years. Having initially been allocated the quarters located at No. 2 , Park Lane, Off Park

Road, Colombo 05, on 01st July 1991, the Petitioner, upon assuming the role of Chief

Medical Officer of Health on 23rd March 2000, subsequently expressed the need for a

more suitable official residence, leading to the approval to combine quarters No. 2

with No. 4, Park Lane. Structural modifications were enacted to facilitate this

arrangement, effectively designating the combined premises as the official quarters for

the Chief Medical Officer of Health from 01st July 2003.

21. The provisions of the aforesaid Agreement entered into between the Petitioner and the

1st Respondent Council states as follows:

, ,

,

,

.

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 20

[In the event of the said officials retirement, or resignation from Colombo Municipal

Council, or dismissal from the position, or transfer to another government agency or

local government agency, or, in the event of being transferred to another position

within this municipal council or for any other reason should the current holder of this

title no longer hold this position, the municipal commissioner shall give notice to

return the house taken immediately after such occurrence, within the period specified

in the said notice to hand over clear and vacant possession of the house to the

Colombo Municipal Council]9

22. Furthermore, the Agreement stipulates that if the Petitioner neglects to vacate the

official living quarters located on the premises and fails to relinquish possession of the

aforementioned living quarters to the Respondent Council, the Petitioner shall be

subject to legal action under the provisions of the Local Authority Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978.10

23. However, upon the Petitioner's retirement on 20th May 2014, instead of vacating the

premises as stipulated in the agreement, both he and his wife, despite the latter's

ineligibility for such designated quarters, continued to occupy the premises for a

duration spanning until 11th September 2018. Despite legal action initiated by the

Council, including the issuance of a Notice to Quit and subsequent court proceedings,

the petitioner persisted in resisting eviction efforts, even going so far as to lock the

premises to impede the execution of court orders.

24. From the facts before us, it is amply clear the Petitioners occupation of the said premises

following his retirement was unlawful. This unlawful occupation not only incurred legal

9 Clause 1

10 Clause 9

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 20

expenses for the Council but also disrupted the rightful occupancy of the Chief Medical

Officer of Health's scheduled quarters.

25. Additionally, the attempts made to improperly transfer the premises to the Petitioner's

wife, which were rightfully rebuffed, further underscore the gross disregard the

Petitioner has had towards his contractual duties as well as the regulatory authority of

the Council. This protracted episode of non-compliance, coupled with the collusion

between the Petitioner and his wife to prolong their occupancy, necessitated decisive

legal intervention and exemplifies a flagrant breach of contractual obligations, causing

undue financial strain on the taxpayer and administrative disruption.

26. In this context, the Petitioner contended that the premises were transferred to his wife,

who, at the time, held the position of Deputy Chief Medical Officer (Laboratory Services),

for the purpose of serving as her official residential accommodation. However, the

Respondents refuted the same on two grounds. First, the Petitioner's wife does not meet

the criteria outlined in Clause 4.2 of Chapter XIX of the Establishments Code to qualify

as an eligible official entitled to official residential accommodation. Second, the

Petitioner had no authority whatsoever to allocate or transfer and/or to issue any officer

instructions to allocate or transfer such accommodation among officials.

27. Furthermore, the ineligibility of the Petitioners wife to be allocated official quarters was

duly acknowledged, with the Auditor General further validating this observation through

an Audit Query and in a report submitted to the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA)

of the Parliament. This information is documented in the submission marked R6 and

included in the Statement of Objections on behalf of the 1st, 3rd to 6th Respondents

dated 15th July 2019.

28. The Petitioner alleged that the then Minister, upon an appeal under Section 4 of the

Local Authority Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978, stated that

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 20

Petitioners wife may remain at the quarters until her retirement,11 the Petitioner has not

adduced any proof of the same. Even if such an informal statement was made, as the

Petitioner contended, such a promise would be of no avail in law as Section 4 requires

a formal decision to be made by the Minister.

29. In concluding the examination of these facts, it becomes evident that the failure of the

Petitioner to surrender possession of the official residential quarters was unlawful and

this failure provided ample justification for the 1st Respondent Council to pursue

necessary legal measures to regain control of the premises.

30. The provision outlined in Clause 9 of the Agreement establishes a condition wherein it

requires the Petitioner to surrender the official living quarters to the 1st Respondent

Council. This condition serves as a basis for legal recourse under the Local Authority

Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978 in the event of non-compliance.

The issuance of a Notice to Quit, pursuant to section 3 of this statute, signifies the

initiation of legal proceedings against the Petitioner. Section 5 of the Law imposes an

obligation on the Petitioner to adhere to such notices. Failure to comply may lead to

action before a Magistrate's court in accordance with section 6 of the Law, as outlined

in section 6(1).

31. While the extended occupation of the premises by the Petitioner was no doubt unlawful

and unauthorized, it was the contention of the Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Respondents, in withholding the Petitioners pension, have acted in a manner unlawful,

indefensible, unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious in violation of principles of legitimate

expectation, natural justice and reasonableness.

32. In the present case, despite the issuance of the Notice to Quit, the Petitioner had failed

to surrender vacant possession of the designated quarters. Consequently, the 2nd

11 Petition of the Petitioner, para 33

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 20

Respondent had obtained an eviction order from the Magistrate's Court of Colombo on

18th January 2017, which the Petitioner resisted.

33. The provisions for deducting rental fees for official living quarters from salaries are

outlined in Clauses 5.4 and 5.4.1 of Chapter XIX of the Establishments Code, and

according to these provisions, deductions for the designated official living quarters were

appropriately made from both the Petitioner and his wife.

34. Additionally, due to the Petitioner's refusal to surrender vacant possession of the

aforementioned quarters following his retirement, the Audit Superintendent of the

Auditor General's Department, through a letter dated 29th April 2016, emphasized the

Council's failure to adhere to Clause 7.1 and Clause 7.2 of Chapter XIX of the

Establishments Code. These clauses authorize the Council to evict the Petitioner from

the premises and impose a penal rent for overstaying.

35. Accordingly, there is no doubt that the Respondent Council is to take all lawful steps to

recover the premises as well as rent payment when officials such as the Petitioner

happen to occupy their quarters beyond the period of entitlement.

36. However, it was contended on behalf of the Petitioner, relying on Section 12(1) of the

Minutes on Pensions, that a persons pension can only be withheld or deducted if; (a)

disciplinary proceedings were pending or contemplated at the time of the retirement

from public service of the said person or, (b) an inquiry is pending at the time of

retirement. In support of this position Counsel for the Petitioner relied on the cases of

Upali Sarath Kumara v. Anura Sathurasinghe and Others,12 Wilson Godawela v.

Chandradasa and Others13 and Jayarathne v. Wickremaratne and Others.14

12 SCFR 384/2016, SC Minutes of 03 December 2018

13 [1995] 2 Sri LR 338

14 [2003] 2 Sri LR 276

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 20

37. I see it pertinent to be cognizant of some other elements of the case of Jayarathne v.

Wickremaratne and Others15 which the Petitioner did not highlight in his submissions.

The said case also provides, citing Gunawardane v. Attorney-General16 that,

minutes of pension does not confer upon a retired government servant any legal

right in respect of pension minutes of pension merely regulates the administration

of pensions by those in whose hand that duty is placed.

38. Section 12(1) of the Minutes on Pension provides as follows:

Where the explanation tendered by a public servant against whom, at the time of

his retirement from public service, disciplinary proceedings were pending or

contemplated in respect of his negligence, irregularity or misconduct is considered to

be unsatisfactory by the competent authority, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of

Public Administration, Local Government and Home Affairs May either withhold or

reduce any pension, gratuity or other allowance payable to such public servant under

these Minutes.

39. It is clear that any withholding of pension benefits under Section 12(1) of the Minutes

on Pensions has to be done in the manner provided in the aforementioned cases: to this

extent, I am in complete agreement with the Petitioner. However, the above cases are

readily distinguishable from the case at hand. The Respondents could not have

contemplated a disciplinary inquiry with regard to the Petitioners unlawful occupation

of his official quarters at the time of retirement as the said occupation only became

unlawful after his retirement. Furthermore, Section 12(1) of the Minutes on Pensions is

concerned with disciplinary matters of officers and the instant case is not of that

15 ibid at 280

16 49 NLR 359

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 20

character. Therefore, Section 12(1) of the Minutes on Pensions has no bearing on the

instant case.

40. As apparent from the material before us, which I have adverted to earlier, the

Respondent Council had initiated court proceedings before the Colombo Magistrates

Court under Section 6 of the Local Authority Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No.

42 of 1978. Moreover, the Auditor General Department, by letter marked R6, dated

29th April 2016, has recommended that action may be taken as appropriate under

Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of Chapter XIX of the Establishment Code.

41. It is very clear that, based on the finding of the Magistrates Court as well as the Auditor

General, the Petitioner is liable to pay penal rent for the unauthorized period of

occupation in the premises previously assigned to him as official quarters. In line with

Section 43A of the Minutes on Pensions and Clause 4: 2: 5 of Chapter XXIV of the

Establishment Code, the Respondents may take necessary steps to recover the total sum

owed by the Petitioner for this unauthorized occupation, as penal rent or otherwise, by

deducting the same from his pension payments.

Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

42. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides that [a]ll persons are equal before the law and

are entitled to the equal protection of the law.

43. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides for the fundamental right to equal treatment

and equal protection before the law and is accepted as not only a rule against

discriminatory treatment but also as a right antithetical to arbitrariness, mala fides and

such other injustices known to law, encapsulating the Rule of Law itself.

44. The Petitioner suggested that he has been the subject of arbitrary, mala fide, ad hoc and

ad hominem policies and treatments. According to the written submissions on behalf of

the 1st, 3A, 4th and 5A Respondents, a policy decision not to process the pension and

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 20

pension gratuity until occupants hand over possession of their official quarters was

taken under Item No. 960 at a General Meeting of the Council held on 27th June 2013.

And the Petitioner, being a Head of a Department of the Council at that time, ought to

have been aware of this decision.

45. The said Respondents further submitted that the Petitioner was, in fact, aware of this

policy decision and submitted documents marked R15 and R1617 as proof of the

same. Following the said policy decision, the Municipal Treasurer had circulated a

Circular dated 02nd September 2013, among the heads of departments including the

Petitioner. The Respondent submitted that the Petitioner upon receipt of the same had

made a minute in his own handwriting instructing the Assistant Secretary and the

Accountant to take necessary action. Perusal of the document marked R16 clearly

indicates that the Municipal Treasurer had informed the Petitioner of this policy decision

by the said Circular. As such, there is no doubt that the Petitioner had, in fact, been well

aware of the said policy decision at the time of his retirement. While being so aware,

there is no indication that he has ever sought to challenge the validity of the same

before any court of law. As such, it cannot be said that this particular policy is ad hoc or

that it was implemented as against the Petitioner in bad faith.

46. Moreover, once the Petitioner ceased to occupy the premises in question, the

Respondents have set in motion the process to continue the payment of his pension.

After vacant possession of the quarters in question was handed over to the 1st

Respondent Council, the Petitioner claimed to have inquired regarding the payment of

his pension by communication dated 03rd October 2018 to the Municipal Commissioner.

According to the Petitioner, following this inquiry, he had received a letter dated 15th

October 2018 from the Deputy Commissioner along with a new set of application forms

17 Appended to the Statement of Objections of the 1st, 3A, 4th and 5A Respondents dated 15 July 2019

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 20

to be filled and submitted.18 However, the Petitioner has not submitted this new set of

forms as he had already submitted some forms as far back as 2014.19 The Petitioner

further contended that new forms are not applicable to the Petitioner, as he had already

retired by the time the new forms were introduced by Pension Circular No. 03/2015

dated 24th April 2015. The Petitioner argued that these new application forms were

introduced into the mix by the Respondents to find an avenue to frustrate the rights of

the Petitioner with regard to his pension.

47. It is true that the Petitioner is not strictly required to file the new set of applications

forms. However, that, on its own, is insufficient to establish a violation of fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It is trite law that not every

wrongful act amounts to a violations fundamental rights and missteps of this nature can

very well result from various factors other than administrative wrongs recognized by

law. Whether there is a violation of fundamental rights by any wrongful act or missteps,

so to speak, is largely dependent upon the circumstances of each individual case.

48. As apparent from the record, once the Petitioner handed over possession of the

premises and preferred a communication dated 03rd October 2018 to the Municipal

Commissioner concerning the non-payment of his pensions, he had received a reply 12

days later indicating that new forms needed to be filled. It is clear appears that, after

recovering possession of the official quarters in question, the 1st Respondent Council

had attempted to address the grievances of the Petitioner by requiring him to fill out

the new set of forms, which the Petitioner had resisted. While the mistaken request to

submit a new set of forms may have caused an inconvenience to the Petitioner, there

are no indications that it was so done in bad faith.

18 Written Submissions of the Petitioner dated 17 November 2021, para 11

19 Marked 8R1

SC (FR) Application 08/2019 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 20

49. No doubt there are some procedural oversights surrounding the processing of

Petitioners pension application. The clearest of which relates to the issuance of the

Petitioners commuted pension in January 2015 overlooking his unlawful occupancy of

the quarters and the subsequent failure of the Council to act under the provisions of the

Establishments Code as observed in Auditor General Department letter dated 29th April

2016, marked R6. Very clearly, the Petitioner has only benefitted from these oversights.

50. From the circumstances of the instant case, especially the continued willingness of the

Respondents to process the Petitioners pension, I am of the view that Petitioner has

failed to establish any unreasonableness, mala fides or any such other wrong known to

law on the part of the Respondents which affected him adversely. As such, I am of the

view that there is no violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Municipal Council and the Department of Pensions

shall take necessary steps under the Establishment Code and the Minutes on Pensions

to dispense the Petitioners pension.

Application Dismissed.
