"","Petitionerâ€™s wife may remain at the quarters until her retirement,11 the Petitioner has not"
"","adduced any proof of the same. Even if such an informal statement was made, as the"
"","Petitioner contended, such a promise would be of no avail in law as Section 4 requires"
"","a formal decision to be made by the Minister."
"29.","In concluding the examination of these facts, it becomes evident that the failure of the"
"","Petitioner to surrender possession of the official residential quarters was unlawful and"
"","this  failure  provided  ample  justification  for  the  1st  Respondent  Council  to  pursue"
"","necessary legal measures to regain control of the premises."
"30.","The provision outlined in Clause 9 of the Agreement establishes a condition wherein it"
"","requires  the  Petitioner  to  surrender  the  official  living  quarters  to  the  1st  Respondent"
"","Council.  This  condition  serves  as  a  basis  for  legal  recourse  under  the  Local  Authority"
"","Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978 in the event of non-compliance."
"","The  issuance  of  a  Notice  to  Quit,  pursuant  to  section  3  of  this  statute,  signifies  the"
"","initiation of legal proceedings against the Petitioner. Section 5 of the Law imposes an"
"","obligation on the Petitioner to adhere to such notices. Failure to comply may lead to"
"","action before a Magistrate's court in accordance with section 6 of the Law, as outlined"
"","in section 6(1)."
