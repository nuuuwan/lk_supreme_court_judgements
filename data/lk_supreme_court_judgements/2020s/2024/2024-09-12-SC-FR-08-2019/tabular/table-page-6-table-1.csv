"","residence (quarters bearing No. 2 ½, upstairs) with the vacant quarters bearing No. 4"
"","extending the floor area."
"6.","For 
such  consolidation, 
structural  modifications  were  undertaken, 
including 
the"
"","construction of a staircase to physically connect the two units. The Petitioner states that,"
"","as this  structural change was temporary in nature, it was never  sent to the Mayor or"
"","Council for approval. Moreover, there had been an audit query by the Government Audit"
"","Superintendent  of  the  Auditor  General’s  Department  of  Sri  Lanka  regarding  the"
"","Petitioner utilizing two quarters with an aggregate floor area of 2200 sq. ft. However,"
"","the Council had replied favourably towards the Petitioner stating, inter alia,  that he was"
"","holding an important position and that he was entitled to a larger floor area than what"
"","was originally assigned to him."
"7.","These combined quarters (henceforth referred to as the ""official living quarters"") had"
"","subsequently served as the duly approved residence for the Chief Medical Officer from"
"","1st July 2003, for a period of eleven years. Notably, recognition of these quarters as the"
"","""scheduled quarters"" for the Chief Medical Officer position was established under Clause"
"","1.1 of Chapter XIX of the Establishments Code."
"8.","On 02nd May 2014, a formal request for the allocation of the subject premises as official"
"","living  quarters  was  submitted  by  Dr.  (Mrs.)  A.  Kariyawasam,  the  then  Deputy  Chief"
"","Medical Officer of Health (Laboratory Services) and the wife of the Petitioner (henceforth"
"","referred to as ""Petitioner's wife""). This request, addressed to the Chief Medical Officer"
"","(at the time, the Petitioner), sought occupancy effective from 15th May 2014, with salary"
"","deductions for related rentals.2"
