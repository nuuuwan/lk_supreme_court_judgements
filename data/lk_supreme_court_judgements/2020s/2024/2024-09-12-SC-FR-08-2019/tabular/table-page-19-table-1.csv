"49.  No  doubt","there  are  some  procedural  oversights  surrounding 
the  processing  of"
"","Petitioner’s  pension  application.  The  clearest  of  which  relates  to  the  issuance  of  the"
"","Petitioner’s commuted pension in January 2015 overlooking his unlawful occupancy of"
"","the quarters and the subsequent failure of the Council to act under the provisions of the"
"","Establishments Code as observed in Auditor General Department letter dated 29th April"
"","2016, marked ‘R6’. Very clearly, the Petitioner has only benefitted from these oversights."
"50.","From the circumstances of the instant case, especially the continued willingness of the"
"","Respondents to process the Petitioner’s pension, I am of the view that  Petitioner has"
"","failed to establish any unreasonableness, mala fides or any such other wrong known to"
"","law on the part of the Respondents which affected him adversely. As such, I am of the"
"","view that there is no violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under"
"","Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Municipal Council and the Department of Pensions"
"","shall take necessary steps under the Establishment Code and the Minutes on Pensions"
"","to dispense the Petitioner’s pension."
