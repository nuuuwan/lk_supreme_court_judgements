"","to be filled and submitted.18 However, the Petitioner has not submitted this new set of"
"","forms  as  he  had  already  submitted  some  forms  as  far  back  as  2014.19  The  Petitioner"
"","further contended that new forms are not applicable to the Petitioner, as he had already"
"","retired  by  the  time  the  new  forms  were  introduced  by  Pension  Circular  No.  03/2015"
"","dated  24th  April  2015.  The  Petitioner  argued  that  these  new  application  forms  were"
"","“introduced into the mix by the Respondents to find an avenue to frustrate the rights of"
"","the Petitioner with regard to his pension”."
"47.","It is true that the Petitioner is not  strictly required to file the new  set of applications"
"","forms. However, that, on its own, is insufficient to establish a violation of fundamental"
"","rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It is trite law that not every"
"","wrongful act amounts to a violations fundamental rights and missteps of this nature can"
"","very  well  result  from  various  factors  other  than  administrative  wrongs  recognized  by"
"","law. Whether there is a violation of fundamental rights by any wrongful act or missteps,"
"","so to speak, is largely dependent upon the circumstances of each individual case."
"48.","As  apparent  from  the  record,  once  the  Petitioner  handed  over  possession  of  the"
"","premises  and  preferred  a  communication  dated  03rd  October  2018  to  the  Municipal"
"","Commissioner concerning the non-payment of his pensions, he had received a reply 12"
"","days later indicating that new forms needed to be filled. It is clear appears that, after"
"","recovering possession of the official quarters in question, the 1st Respondent Council"
"","had attempted to address the grievances of the Petitioner by requiring him to fill out"
"","the new set of forms, which the Petitioner had resisted. While the mistaken request to"
"","submit a new set of forms may have caused an inconvenience to the Petitioner, there"
"","are no indications that it was so done in bad faith."
