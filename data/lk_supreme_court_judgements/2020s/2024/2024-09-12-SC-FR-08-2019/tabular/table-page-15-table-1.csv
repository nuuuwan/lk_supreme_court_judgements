"37.","I see it pertinent to be cognizant of some other elements of the case of Jayarathne v."
"","Wickremaratne and Others15 which the Petitioner did not highlight in his submissions."
"","The said case also provides, citing Gunawardane v. Attorney-General16 that,"
"","“… minutes of pension does not confer upon a retired government servant any legal"
"","right in respect of pension… minutes of pension merely regulates the administration"
"","of pensions by those in whose hand that duty is placed.”"
"38.","Section 12(1) of the Minutes on Pension provides as follows:"
"","“Where the explanation tendered by a public servant against whom, at the time of"
"","his  retirement  from  public  service,  disciplinary  proceedings  were  pending  or"
"","contemplated in respect of his negligence, irregularity or misconduct is considered to"
"","be unsatisfactory by the competent authority, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of"
"","Public Administration, Local Government and Home Affairs May either withhold or"
"","reduce any pension, gratuity or other allowance payable to such public servant under"
"","these Minutes."
"39.","It is clear that any withholding of pension benefits under Section 12(1) of the Minutes"
"","on Pensions has to be done in the manner provided in the aforementioned cases: to this"
"","extent, I am in complete agreement with the Petitioner. However, the above cases are"
"","readily  distinguishable 
from  the  case  at  hand.  The  Respondents  could  not  have"
"","contemplated a disciplinary inquiry with regard to the Petitioner’s unlawful occupation"
"","of  his  official  quarters  at  the  time  of  retirement  as  the  said  occupation  only  became"
"","unlawful after his retirement. Furthermore, Section 12(1) of the Minutes on Pensions is"
"","concerned  with  disciplinary  matters  of  officers  and  the  instant  case  is  not  of  that"
