ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 02-05-2024.

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners and also the

submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for all the Respondents

other than the 12th Respondent and concluded the argument. The Petitioners in this case are

owners/ cultivators/ occupiers of pieces of lands situated around the roadway depicted in the

sketch produced by the Petitioners marked P10. In the said sketch, the situation of their lands

in relation to the land of the 12th Respondent are clearly depicted.

[SC FR 253/2020] - Page 5 of 8

The primary complaint made by the Petitioners in their Petition is against the alleged

involvement of the 1st-7th Respondents in constructing a fence across this roadway blocking

their free movement and the use of that roadway (Vide, paragraph 5(J) of the Petition dated

10-08-2020). The alleged unlawfully constructed fence is also shown in the said sketch marked

P10. It was the complaint of the Petitioners that the said alleged arbitrary construction of the

fence had prevented them from accessing their paddy fields which are also shown on the

extreme northern side in the said sketch P10.

It is on this basis that the Petitioners have alleged that the said Respondents have infringed

their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Petitioners in their Petition have also complained that the said Respondents had proceeded to

arrest the 1st Petitioner on 24-04-2020 without any lawful justification.

Upon this Petition being supported for Leave to Proceed, this Court by its order dated 04-09-

2020, having considered the submissions made by both parties, had decided to grant Leave

to Proceed in respect of the alleged infringement of Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners

guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution.

The Respondents, in particular, the 1st Respondent, the Officer-in-Charge of Police Station

Moragahahena, has tendered to this Court, his affidavit annexing the relevant Notes of

Investigation pertaining to the incident complained of, by the Petitioners. Perusal of the

Investigation Notes produced marked 1 R1, 1 R2, 1 R3, 1 R4, 1 R5, 1 R6, 1 R7, 1 R8, 1

R9 & 1 R10 clearly shows that there has been a dispute continuing for some time, between

the 12th Respondent and the Petitioners in relation to the roadway shown in the sketch

produced by the Petitioners marked P10.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioners in the course of his submissions admitted that it was the

Petitioners who initially engaged in clearing this road which is shown on the sketch P10.

We observe that this had been the root cause for the eruption of the dispute between the

Petitioners and the 12th Respondent which then had prolonged. That is a common ground

between the parties.

[SC FR 253/2020] - Page 6 of 8

It is opportune at this stage, to straightaway refer to the letter dated 28-03-2022 produced

marked 13 R8 annexed to the affidavit filed by the 13th Respondent who is the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Kalutara District. This letter (13 R8) which has been

addressed to both the Petitioners and the 12th Respondent, contains the decision, the said

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services had arrived at, after the inquiry relating to the

dispute between those parties over the relevant roadway. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners

admits that the roadway referred to in the decision contained in 13 R8 is the roadway shown

on the sketch produced by the Petitioners marked (P10). What is important in this decision

is the fact that the 13th Respondent (the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services) has

decided that the roadway relevant to this dispute which is also the roadway shown on sketch

P10 should remain only as a four feet wide roadway. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners in

the course of his submissions conceded that the Petitioners are bound by the said decision of

the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services (13 R8) as they have not canvassed it

thereafter in any other higher fora.

Admittedly, the Petitioners have cleared this roadway from its then existed four feet width to

make it a wider roadway. The Petitioners have admitted that they had engaged the services

of a backhoe to achieve this purpose. Going by the paragraph 2 of the decision of the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services (13 R8), we observe that the Petitioners had succeeded

in widening this roadway four feet to a twelve feet width.

Petitioners in their Petition have specifically stated that they are not claiming anything against

the 13th Respondent (the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services) who decided that the

roadway shown on sketch P10 should remain only as four feet wide roadway (paragraph 4

(m) of the Petition). As has already been mentioned above, the Petitioners have not

challenged the decision contained in 13 R8 thereafter. Therefore, we have to go on the basis

that the impugned roadway can be used by its users, only as a four feet wide roadway. That

is the established entitlement for the Petitioners as well. On their own admission, the

Petitioners had widened this roadway and converted it to a twelve feet wide roadway. There

is no justification before us for the said action of unlawful widening of this roadway by the

Petitioners. Even if the Petitioners claim an entitlement to such a wide road, it is not a matter

which this Court can adjudicate in this case which is a Fundamental Rights violation Petition

by the executive or administrative action. In such a claim, the Petitioners need to advice

themselves regarding any such possibility. We can see that it is also not the wish of the

Petitioners in the instant case. That is because the Petitioners have filed this Petition only with

[SC FR 253/2020] - Page 7 of 8

a view to vindicate the alleged infringement of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under

Articles 12(1) & 13(1) of the Constitution.

We observe that although the arrest of the 1st Petitioner had been done on 17-02-2021, the

1st complaint in relation to the clearing of this roadway has been made as far back as 09-04-

2020. This is manifest from the document produced marked 1 R1. This complaint has been

made to Moragahahena Police Station by the 12th Respondent. We observe that from that

date onwards, the officers of Moragahahena Police Station were compelled to get themselves

involved from time to time in settling the ongoing disputes that had taken place on several

days between the period of the 1st complaint i.e. 09-04-2020 and the date of arrest i.e., 17-

02-2021. We also observe that prior to the arrest of the 1st Petitioner which was made on 17-

02-2021, the Officer-in-Charge of Moragahahena Police Station had filed a report produced

marked 1 R9 which is dated 16-10-2020 reporting these incidents to the Magistrate’s Court.

In the Report (1 R9), the Officer-in-Charge of Moragahahena Police Station (1st Respondent)

has reported to Cout that the 1st Petitioner had committed offences punishable under Sections

314, 316, 433 and 486 of the Penal Code. The 1st Respondent in the same report had

requested further time to arrest the 1st Petitioner and produce before Court. It is much after

the said report was filed in Court that the 1st Respondent had proceeded to arrest the 1st

Petitioner. We observe that this arrest also has been made upon the 1st Petitioner appearing

before the Police Station on notice. Moreover, we observe that the 1st Petitioner has been

released on the same day upon his entering into a surety bond at the Police Station itself.

This is clear from the document produced, marked 1 R10. Although, the Petitioners may

have denied these notes, we observe that the Petitioners have not countered the fact the 1st

Petitioner was arrested on 17-02-2021 and released on the same day after entering into a

bond at the Police Station itself. In these circumstances, we are unable to hold that the 1st -

7th Respondents are responsible for any sort of infringement of any Fundamental Rights of

the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 13(1) of the Constitution.

As has been adverted to above, upon a complaint made by the 12th Respondent in relation to

any unlawful acts being committed pertaining to this roadway, we are unable to hold that the

1st -7th Respondents should never have got involved in settling this dispute as it has been

brought to the notice of Police.

[SC FR 253/2020] - Page 8 of 8

Indeed, from the 1st complaint on 09-04-2020 up to the arrest of the 1st Petitioner on 17-02-

2021, we cannot see any arbitrary action on the part of the Polie Officers of Moragahahena

Police Station as they had only engaged in their duties lawfully in order to maintain peace in

the area and preserve law and order situation in the area. Therefore, we are also unable to

hold with the Petitioners that the 1st -7th Respondents have infringed the Fundamental Rights

of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

For the above reasons, we hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to succeed with this

Petition. We decide to refuse this Petition. This Petition must stand dismissed without costs.
