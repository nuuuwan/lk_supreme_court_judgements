"as  security  under  subsection  (1A)  to  be  deposited  in  an  account"
"bearing interests, in any approved bank in Sri Lanka."
"Similar provisions as to depositing money as security were introduced by"
"section 31DDDDD of the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of"
"2022 when the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is invoked."
"The manner in which the cash deposited in the Labour Tribunal is to be"
"disbursed at the conclusion of the appellate process is comprehensively"
"set out in section 31DDDD."
"Is furnishing security within the appealable time mandatory?"
"The next question is whether the time limit for filing an appeal and the"
"requirement to provide security within that period are mandatory. In my"
"view,  both  requirements  are  mandatory.  To  hold  that  the  former  is"
"mandatory but the latter is directory contradicts the clear intention of the"
"legislature."
"In Sri Lanka General Workers Union v. Samaranayake [1996] 2 Sri LR 268"
"at 276 Justice Mark Fernando stated that “the time limit of thirty days for"
"the deposit of security laid down by section 31D is not mandatory.” Having"
"said so, His Lordship further elucidated that “That does not mean that the"
"time limit can be ignored. Where the objection is taken, the burden is on"
"the Appellant to satisfy the High Court that it should exercise its discretion"
