"Article 23(1) of the Constitution:",""
"","(1) All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala"
"","and Tamil, together with a translation thereof in English:"
"","P
rovided that Parliament shall, at the stage of enactment of any law determine which"
"","text shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency between texts:"
"","P
rovided further that in respect of all other written laws and the text in which such written"
"","l
aws was enacted or adopted or made, shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency"
"","between such texts."
"Thus, when there is a disparity between the Sinhala text and English Text, the Sinhala text must prevail.",""
"This is because as per Article 23(1) of the Constitution, all laws are enacted in Sinhala and Tamil and",""
"not  in  English.  Furthermore,  we  have  to  be  mindful  that  the  English  version  of  any  law  is  only  a",""
"translation of the law which may necessarily have been enacted in Sinhala and Tamil.",""
"S","ection 11 of the ICCPR Act only states that in the event of any inconsistency between the Sinhala and"
"Tamil texts  of the Act, the Sinhala text  shall prevail. Thus, we observe that  it  is the Sinhala version",""
"which must prevail in case of a discrepancy between the different languages.",""
"T","he matter does not end there. We now have to consider as to what the Parliament had intended to"
"achieve through the promulgation of the ICCPR Act. It is to that issue we would now turn.",""
"I","n order to consider the intention of the Parliament, it is necessary first to consider the background"
"under which the ICCPR Act was promulgated.  Generally, it is in the recitals found in the Preamble of",""
"the Act  that  the mischief to be remedied,  and  the scope of the Act  are described.  Therefore, let  us",""
"reproduce the Preamble of the ICCPR Act below. It is as follows:",""
"","â€œ
 
WHEREAS Sri Lanka is a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"
"","which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 16th December, 1966 and"
"","entered into force on 23rd March, 1976:"
"","A
ND WHEREAS Sri Lanka has acceded to the aforesaid Covenant on 11th June, 1980:"
