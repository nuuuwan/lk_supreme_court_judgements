"being tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted."
"This becomes clear when one juxtaposes Section 4(3) of the ICCPR Act with its corresponding provision"
"in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"T
hus,  the  Civil  and  Political  right  which  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights  had"
"sought to protect under its Article 14(7) is the protection against being tried or punished again for an"
"offence for which the Appellant has already been finally convicted or acquitted. We find no provision"
"in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which had sought to protect the Appellant"
"being tried or punished for an offence from which he has been discharged."
"M
oreover, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights could not have been drafted in Sinhala"
"but  in  one  or  more  international  languages  of  which  English  is  one.  Perusal  of  Section  4  (3)  of  the"
"English ICCPR Act shows clearly that it is substantially a reproduction of the provision in Article 14(7) of"
"the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The purpose of the said provision is clear. That"
"is to protect all persons from being tried or punished for any criminal offence for which such person has"
"already been convicted or acquitted according to law."
"F
urthermore, we see that there are two categories of persons who cannot be tried or punished again"
"for the same offence under Section 4 (3) of English ICCPR Act. The first category is persons who have"
"already been convicted for the same offence. The Second category is those who have been acquitted"
"from the same offence."
"H
owever, Section 4 (3) of the Sinhala ICCPR Act has used the phrase “නිදහස් කරනු ලැෙ ඇති ”  instead"
"of the word ‘acquitted’. The meaning of the phrase “නිදහස් කරනු ලැෙ ඇති ” is, discharged."
"I
f we are to adopt the strict interpretation of the phrase “නිදහස් කරනු ලැෙ ඇති ”, upholding the argument"
"of the Appellant to hold that the relevant category of persons who cannot be tried or punished again"
"for the same offence under Section 4 (3) of the Sinhala ICCPR Act, is the category of those who have"
"been  once  discharged  from  the  same  offence,  then  the  resultant  position  would be  that  there  is  no"
"provision to  protect  the category of persons who  have been acquitted once from the same offence."
"Ironically, this would lead to the interpretation that Section 4 (3) of Sinhala ICCPR Act has not extended"
