"with the said murders?"
"At the hearing of the appeal, the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  Appellant,  submitted  that  even 
if  the  testimony  of  the 
injured"
"Thotapitiya  Arachchilage  Kusumawathie  is  accepted  as  a  whole  and  the"
"prosecution  case  is  placed  at  its  best,  still  there  was  insufficiency  of"
"evidence,  either  in  the  form  of  direct  or  circumstantial  evidence,  in"
"order to justify drawing an irresistible and necessary inference as to his"
"guilt  to  the  count of  attempted  murder.  He  further  contended  that  the"
"prosecution  had  failed  to  establish  that  the  Appellant’s  participatory"
"presence  to  the  attempted  murder  of  Kusumawathie  to  the  required"
"degree  of  proof.  Similarly,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel stressed  on"
"the  point 
that 
there  was  no  evidence  at  all 
to  establish 
that 
the"
"Appellant  was  even  merely  present  when 
the 
two  murders  were"
"committed,  and  that  factor  had  effectively  negated  justification  of  any"
"inference  drawn  by  the  Court  on  his  complicity  to  the  said  murders."
"Therefore, the learned President’s Counsel contended that the appellate"
"Court  had 
fallen 
into  grave 
error 
in 
affirming 
the  Appellant’s"
"convictions  to  the  count  of  attempted  murder  as  well  as  to  the  two"
"counts of murder."
