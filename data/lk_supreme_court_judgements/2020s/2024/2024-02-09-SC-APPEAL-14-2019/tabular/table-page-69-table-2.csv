"Supreme Court Mohan Baitha and Others v State of Bihar and Another",""
"(2001) 4 SCC 350, where it is stated that;",""
"‘same 
transaction' 
from 
“The  expression","its  very  nature 
is"
"incapable 
of  an 
exact  definition. 
It 
is  not","intended 
to  be"
"","interpreted  in  any  artificial  or  technical  sense.  Common  sense"
"","and  the  ordinary  use  of  language  must  decide  whether  on  the"
"","facts of a particular case, it can be held to be in one transaction. It"
"is  not  possible 
to 
enunciate  any","comprehensive 
formula  of"
"","universal application for the purpose of determining whether two"
"or  more 
acts 
constitute 
the 
same","transaction. 
But 
the"
"","circumstances of a given case indicating proximity of time, unity"
"","or  proximity  of  place,  continuity  of  action  and  community  of"
"","purpose or design are the factors for deciding whether certain acts"
"","form  parts  of  the  same  transaction  or  not.  Therefore,  a  series  of"
"acts  whether  are  so  connected  together  as  to","form  the  same"
"","transaction  is  purely  a  question  of  fact  to  be  decided  on  the"
"aforesaid criteria” (emphasis added).",""
