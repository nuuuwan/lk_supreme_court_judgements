"S.C. Appeal No. 14/2019"
"circumstantial  evidence.  Cannon  J,  referring  to  the  contention  by  the"
"appellant  before 
that  Court 
stating 
that 
the 
evidence 
related 
to"
"circumstances  that  are  only  of  suspicion  against  him,  stated  (at  p.149)"
"fact, 
taken  separately,  may  be  so 
termed,  but  the  question 
for 
“…  each"
"consideration  is  whether,  taken  cumulatively,  they  are  sufficient  to  rebut  the"
"presumption of innocence”. The conclusions reached by the trial Court as"
"well  as  the  appellate  Court 
  could  not  be  faulted, 
in  view  of 
the"
"considerations I have already referred to in this Judgment, taken along"
"with 
the  pronouncement 
in 
the 
Judgment  of  Attorney  General  v"
"Seneviratne  (supra)  that  “The  Jury,  who  are  judges  of  fact,  are  entitled,  as"
"they did in the present case, to conclude that where murder and robbery form"
"part of the same transaction, the person who committed the robbery committed"
"the murder also” which I reformulate in relation to the instant appeal to"
"denote  that  the  trial  Court,  being  the  tribunal  of  fact,  is  entitled  to"
"conclude  that    the  persons  who  committed  the  attempted  murder  also"
"committed the two  murders  where the  attempted  murder and the two"
"murders form part of the same transaction,"
