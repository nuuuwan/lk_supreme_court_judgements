"circumstances of the case."
"The  underlying  principle  of  law  contained  in  Section  32  of  the"
"Penal Code,  in  imputing  criminal liability on  a  person  for  the  criminal"
"act  of  another, 
is  evident  from  the  words;  “accused  must  have  been"
"actuated by a common intention with the doer of the act at the time the offence"
"was committed”. Dr.  Gour  in his book Penal Law of India (11th Edition),"
"(at p. 314), states that in order to impute criminal liability under Section"
"34 of the Penal Code of India (which is the counterpart provision to our"
"Section  32)  “the  essence  of  Section  34  is  that  the  person  must  be  physically"
"present  at  the  actual  commission  of  crime.  This  must  be  coupled  with  actual"
"participation.” With the imposition of the requirement of the person, on"
"whom  the  liability  under  Section  32  is  sought  to  be  imputed,  must  be"
"present at the  actual  commission  of  crime,  the  principle  of  law  quoted"
"above in (f) becomes relevant in view of the contention advanced by the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel 
in  relation 
to 
the  count  of  attempted"
"murder. The said principle of law states “mere fact of the presence of the"
"accused  at  the  time  of  the  offence 
is  not  necessarily  evidence  of  common"
"intention.”"
