"S.C. Appeal No. 14/2019"
"denial of the witness of this suggestion was not probed any further and"
"there  was  no  evidence  elicited  by  the  Appellant  to  substantiate  that"

"evidence  is  that there  was  no  recent  incident  that triggered  the  violent"
"attack on Kusumawathie and her children."
