"inferences, but no new principle is introduced.”"
"The word “inference” is defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary 9th"
"Ed, (p.847) as “a conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a"
"logical  consequence  from  them.”    Basnayake  CJ  echoed  this  position  in  the"
"judgment  of  The  Queen  v  Ekmon  and  Others  (1962)  67  NLR  49,  by"
"observing that (at p.62), a “… presumption is not the same as inference. In"
"presumption the presumed fact is taken to be true or  entitled to belief without"
"examination  or  proof  unless  and  until  it  is  disproved  while  inference  is  the"
"conclusion drawn from one or more proved facts or a combination of them”."
