"S.C. Appeal No. 14/2019"
"Howard CJ in the judgment of King v. Herashamy (1946) 47 N. L. R. 83,"
"in which it was held that (at p.89), “ … to convict all of the accused of the"
"offence  of  attempted  murder  each  one  of  them  at  the  time  of  the  assault  was"
"actuated by a common intention not only to beat but also to cause his death or"
"such  bodily  injuries  as  were  sufficient  to  cause  his  death”.  In  the  instant"
"appeal,  the  High  Court  was  convinced  that  the  evidence  presented  by"
"the  prosecution 
satisfied 
these 
requirements 
and 
the  offence  of"
"attempted  murder  was  complete  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  concurred"
"with  that  conclusion.  These  two  conclusions  reached  by  the  Courts"
"below,  which  I  find  to  be  correct  in  both  law  and  in  fact  as  they  were"
"reached after taking into consideration of the circumstances referred to"
"above 
in 
its  totality.  Hence,  even 
if  this  Court  were  to  accept 
the"
"contention of the learned President’s Counsel that, in the absence of any"
"specific act attributed to him during the attack, other than being merely"
"present  with  a 
club 
in  his  hand,  as  opposed 
to 
confirming  his"
"participatory presence, that fact alone does not suffice to absolve him of"
"the 
criminal 
liability 
for 
the 
attempted  murder  of  Kusumawathie"
"vicariously, because the evidence clearly point to a necessary inference"
"that there was indeed a “pre-arranged plan” to which he too was a party"
"and  therefore  his  presence  at  the  commission  of  that  offence  could  be"
"taken a participatory presence."
