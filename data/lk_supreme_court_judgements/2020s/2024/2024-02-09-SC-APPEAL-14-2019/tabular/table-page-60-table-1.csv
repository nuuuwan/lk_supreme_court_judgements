"The Court rejected this contention. The reasoning of the Court is"
"indicative from the following paragraph quoted below;"
"â€œWe  are  unable  to  distinguish  the  case  of  the  6th  accused  from"
"that 
against 
the other 
three 
appellants. It is true that he was"
"physically  not  present 
at 
the 
time 
the  deceased  man  was"
"murdered but we are of opinion that having regard to all the facts"
"and circumstances he was an abettor of this murder, and as such"
"equally 
liable  with  his  co-conspirators.  His 
learned  Counsel"
"conceded  that  the  6th  accused  was  privy to the  tying  up  of  the"
"deceased 
in 
the 
jungle. It 
is  clear 
that  not  only  was 
it 
the"
"intention of the robbers to tie up the deceased man in the jungle"
"but it was also the intention to kill him there, and, therefore, the"
"6th 
accused is equally guilty with his co-conspirators 
in"
"everything  they  did 
in  order  to  give  effect  to  their  common"
"plan. We  agree  with  the  submissions  of  the  Attorney-General"
"with regard to the 6th accused.  He knew that the deceased had to"
"die.  He gave no  evidence at the  trial.   He is an ex-police officer"
"and  with  true  police  caution  he  did  not  like  to  be  seen  carrying"
"the 
incriminating 
suitcase 
in  which 
the  uniform  which  he"
"was to use the following day was packed. We do not think the fact"
"that  the  6th  accused  was  on  the  road  by  the car  while  the  others"
"murders the deceased makes any difference to his case. Somebody"
"had  to  be  by  the  big  car. This  is  a  main  road  and  any  passer-by"
"who  saw  a 
large  car standing  unattended  on  a 
lonely 
forest"
