"4.","A statement1 by the Appellant was recorded by a Police Constable, subsequent to which"
"","certain jewellery items, and later, a mobile phone, were discovered in the Appellant’s"
"","residence."
"5.","The  Appellant  contests  the  authenticity  of  පැ4  on  two  grounds.  First,  the  Appellant"
"","categorically denies having made such a statement. Second, the Appellant seeks to cast"
"","doubt on the legitimacy of පැ4, citing a discrepancy in dates: the statement is dated 24th"
"","June 2010, whereas the Appellant’s arrest occurred on 4th July 2010. This temporal gap,"
"","the Appellant argues, raises a question as to why the arrest did not follow promptly after"
"","the recording of such a statement."
"6.","Before analysing the merits of the Appellant’s case, it is pertinent to trace the trial, the"
"","evidence 
led  and 
the 
findings  of, 
firstly, 
the 
learned  Additional  Magistrate  and,"
"","subsequently, those of the learned High Court Judge."
"7.","In the trial before the Magistrate Court, the Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges,"
"","and the following witnesses were called on behalf of the prosecution: the Complainant"
"","(PW01),  wife  of  PW01,  IP  Pathmina  Illangakoon  (PW02),  AAN  Kamal  Adhikari  (PW03)"
"","Investigating Officer IP Shaminda Perera (PW04), and the Arresting Officer (PW05)."
"8.","PW05, in giving evidence, categorically stated the following: a complaint was received"
"","from PW01 in respect of a housebreaking and theft in December 2009, and subsequent"
"","to investigations, the Appellant was arrested on 4th July 2010. He further stated that, the"
"","Appellant’s  statement  was  recorded  by  one  P.C.  39184  Sirisena.  Subsequent  to  the"
"","recording of such statement, certain jewellery items and eventually a mobile phone were"
"","found 
in  the  possession  of  the  Appellant,  more  specifically 
in  his  residence,  and"
"","produced to the respective police station."
