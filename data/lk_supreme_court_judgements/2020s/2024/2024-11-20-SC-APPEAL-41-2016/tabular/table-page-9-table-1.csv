"20.","Further,  the  Respondents  have  satisfied  to  this  Court  that  at  the  instance  evidence"
"","relating to the date of arrest and recording of the statement was tendered, the Original"
"","Information Book was available to the perusal of the learned Magistrate and the defence"
"","in  open  court. 
In  such 
instance,  the  Appellant  cannot  credibly  contend  that  the"
"","Respondents  are  precluded  from  submitting  documents  which  merely  confirm  the"
"","unchallenged evidence that the Appellant, was, in fact, arrested on 04th July 2010, and"
"","his statement was recorded thereafter – a minuscule typographical inconsistency in the"
"","nature presented in this case is not, in my view, a material error capable of extinguishing"
"","the strength of the evidence posed against the Appellant in establishing his guilt."
"21.","For the purposes of completeness, I will briefly deal with the Appellant’s challenge to"
"","the application of s114 of the Evidence Ordinance. It is trite law that a man in possession"
"","of stolen goods following the theft raises the presumption that he is the thief or received"
"","the  goods  knowing  them  to  be  stolen  unless  he  can  account  for  his  possession.  The"
"","Appellant, when presented the opportunity in the Magistrate Court, did not present any"
"","evidence to offer an explanation to his possession nor did he dispute the evidence of"
"","the prosecution and therefore failed to rebut such a presumption. I am inclined to agree,"
"","as a result, with the Respondents’ position, and the subsequent opinions of the Learned"
"","Additional Magistrate and Judge of the High Court, that the case against the Appellant"
"","has 
been 
proved 
upon 
sufficient, 
adequate 
and 
uncontradictory 
evidence,"
"","notwithstanding  the  discrepancy  in  the  dating  of  the  Appellant’s  recorded  statement"
"","arising from a mere typographical mistake common in the act of manual data entry."
"22.","The Respondents have cited a line of authorities in the written submissions dated 23rd"
"","March  2018 
in  support  of 
the  position 
that  evidence  not  challenged 
in  cross-"
"","examination can be considered to be an undisputed fact and, in given circumstances,"
"","can lead to an inference of admission of that fact."
