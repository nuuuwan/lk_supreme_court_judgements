"","either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless"
"","he can account for his possession;”."
"13.","The learned High Court Judge reasons that, in failing to adduce evidence to reasonably"
"","explain how the goods that form the subject of the theft came to be in his possession,"
"","the Appellant has failed to rebut the evidence of the prosecution to prove that he did"
"","not  commit  the  offences  he  is  accused  of,  namely  the  offence  of  retaining  stolen"
"","property under s394 of the Penal Code."
"14.","The learned High. Court Judge considered, amongst other considerations, the fact that"
"","the  prosecution  had  led  the  evidence  of  the  virtual  complainant,  the  officers  who"
"","investigated  the  complaint  and  closed  the  case.  When  the  defence  was  called,  the"
"","Appellant neither gave evidence nor called any witnesses to offer an explanation as to"
"","his possession of the stolen articles. Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge took the"
"","view that, in the absence of such explanation, a presumption against the Appellant has"
"","been raised, and was not successfully rebutted."
"15.","The Appellant disputes the operation of the above presumption on the basis that the"
"","statement, පැ4, upon which the stolen goods were recovered, is dated prior to his arrest"
"","and, further, as a result, further raises doubts as to why his arrest did not occur earlier."
"16.","The  written 
submissions  of 
the  1st 
and  2nd  Plaintiff-Respondents-Respondents"
"","(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “Respondents”)  dated  23rd  March  2018  reiterate  the"
"","narration of events presented in the evidence of PW05; the Appellant was arrested on"
"","04th July 2010 following a complaint, and a statement was recorded on the same day"
"","soon after the Appellant’s arrest."
