"23.","In the Court of Appeal judgment, P.V. Hemalatha Kulasiri v Republic of Sri Lanka,4"
"","His Lordship Sisira De Abrew J opined:"
"","“In my view, when an item of evidence is led in a criminal trial through a reliable"
"","witness and the opportunity to challenge such an item of evidence is not availed of"
"","by the opposing party it is justifiable to conclude that he does not do so for the reason"
"","that, if challenged, it would be unfavourable to the opposing party."

"","of Punjab5 in support of his reasoning, in which the Supreme Court held that:"
"","“It  is  a  rule  of  essential  justice  that  whenever  the  opponent  has  declined  to  avail"
"","himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination it must follow that"
"","the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted."
"25.","Likewise, the Appellant’s failure, or rather, election to fail to challenge the evidence of"
"","the prosecution renders the belated complaint of the Appellant only upon appeal to be"
"","futile;  this  Court  cannot  assist  an  accused  whose  silence  at  the  trial  stage  has  been"
"","correctly interpreted to infer an admittance by the accused of the evidence presented"
"","against  him.  Manifestly,  even  in  a  situation  where  the  erroneously  dated  recorded"
