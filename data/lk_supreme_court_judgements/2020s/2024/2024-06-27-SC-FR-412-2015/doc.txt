P. Padman Surasena, J.

The Petitioner, filed the Petition pertaining to the instant case in this Court on 09-11-2015,

praying inter alia, for;

i. Leave to proceed under Article 11, 12(1), 13(1) and (2) of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

[SC (FR) 412/2015] - Page 3 of 7

ii. a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under Articles

11, 12(1), 13(1) and (2), of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka are been violated by the 1st to the 3rd Respondents.

iii. an Interim Order directing the Hon. Attorney General to hold an inquiry and indict all

those who are accused in this case for the offence of Torture and Cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment as per the powers given to the Attorney General by Act No 22 of

1994.

iv. an interim Order directing the Inspector General of Police to hold an immediate internal

inquiry against the 1st and 2nd Respondents of the Police Department and take

administrative action against them if found guilty of said violations.

v. Granting of costs

vi. Rupees 500,000,000/- as compensation

This Court on 11-03-2016, having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner and the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Respondents, had decided to

grant Leave to Proceed in respect of the alleged violations of the Fundamental Rights

guaranteed to the Petitioner under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution by the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Defendants.

In the course of the argument, the learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted that the

Petitioner has failed to file the Petition in the instant case within the time permitted by law.

i.e., within one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution. It was on that basis

that he submitted that this Court should dismiss this Petition as it cannot be maintained any

further in Court.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner sought to counter that argument by stating that the

Petitioner has lodged a complaint in the Human Rights Commission which gives him an

entitlement to maintain this case. I would now proceed to consider this argument as it pertains

to a preliminary issue.

The Petitioner has filed the instant application on 19th November 2015. The latest alleged act

of infringement i.e. of Article 13 (2), according to the Petition, had occurred from the 16th

September 2015 to the 19th of September 2015. This is because the Petitioner has admitted

[SC (FR) 412/2015] - Page 4 of 7

in his Petition1 that he was produced before the Minuwangoda Magistrates Court on the 19th

of September 2015 upon which the learned Magistrate of Minuwangoda had ordered that the

Petitioner be remanded till the 28th September 2015. The learned Magistrate of Minuwangoda

had thereafter had extended the period of remand of the Petitioner till the 02nd October 2015.

Thereafter, the Petitioner was released from custody on the 01st October 2015.

The Petitioner states that he got himself admitted to Gampaha hospital thereafter and the

hospital had discharged him on 5th October 2015.

It is trite law that in terms of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution, a fundamental rights

application must be filed within one month (30 days) of the alleged infringement. Thus, even

if we consider the supposed date of discharge from the Gampaha Hospital as the date upon

which the one-month time bar begins to run (without conceding that this is the correct

position), the resultant position would be that the Petitioner has filed his Petition in the instant

case, one month and 4 days after the date of his discharge from the hospital. If one is to go

by the date of his being released from the Prisons custody, then the resultant position would

be that the Petitioner has filed his Petition in the instant case one month and 8 days after the

date of his release. On either of the above scenarios, on account of Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution, the Petition in the instant case has been filed outside the time limit permitted by

law.

There is yet another question to be considered. That is the question of applicability of the

provision of law in Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of

1996. This is because the Petitioner has averred in his Petition2 that he had lodged a complaint

dated 08th October 2015, at the Human Rights Commission under the No. HRC/3486/2015. In

that paragraph, the Petitioner has stated that he would produce a copy of the complaint to

Court in due course. although the Petitioner has stated in that paragraph that he would mark

the complaint he had lodged at the Human Rights Commission as P3, no such document was

ever produced by the Petitioner even thereafter.

Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 is as follows.

1 Paragraph 30 of the Petition dated 09th November 2015. 2 Paragraph 40 of the Petition dated 09th November 2015.

[SC (FR) 412/2015] - Page 5 of 7

where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14, to the

Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement

of a fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the period within

which the inquiry into such complaint is pending 3 before the Commission, shall

not be taken into account in computing the period of one month within which an

application may be made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126

(2) of the Constitution.

What section 13 (1) states is, not to take, the period within which the inquiry into a complaint

is pending before the Commission, into account, for the purpose of computing the period of

one month referred to in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

a) In the case of Thilangi Kandambi Vs. State Timber Corporation and others,4

Janak De Silva J (with Murdu N. B. Fernando PC, J and Kumuduni

Wickremasinghe J agreeing), interpreting the above provisions of law held that

the jurisprudence has established the following principles:The initial view was

that mere production of a complaint made to the Human Rights Commission of

Sri Lanka within one month of the alleged infringement is sufficient to get the

benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of

Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43,

Alles v. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province, (S.C.F.R.

448/2009, S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].

b) However, the correct position is that a petitioner must show evidence that the

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has conducted an inquiry regarding the

complaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a complaint is

inadequate. [Subasinghe v. Inspector General of Police, SC (Spl) 16/1999,

S.C.M. 11.09.2000; Kariyawasam v. Southern Provincial Road Development

Authority and 8 Others, (2007) 2 Sri.L.R. 33; Ranaweera and Others v. Sub-

Inspector Wilson Siriwardene and Others (2008) 1 Sri.L.R. 260; K.H.G. Kithsiri

v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, S.C.M. 10.01.2018); Wanasinghe v.

Kamal Paliskara and Others, (S.C.F.R. 216/2014, S.C.M. 23.06.2021)].

3 Emphasis added. 4 S.C. F.R. Application No. 452/2019, S.C.M 14.12.2022.

[SC (FR) 412/2015] - Page 6 of 7

c) A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 where the complaint to the Human

Rights Commission is made one month after the alleged violation [Alagaratnam

Manoranjan v. G.A. Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern Province, (S.C.F.R.

261/2013, S.C.M. 11.09.2014)]

d) The provisions of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

Act No. 21 of 1996 is not available to a petitioner who has made a complaint

to the Human Rights Commission only to obtain an advantage by bringing his

application within Article 126(2) of the Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer

Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)]

Turning back to the instant case, I only find a bare averment (afore-stated paragraph 40 and

the corresponding paragraph in the Petitioners affidavit) indicating that he had lodged a

complaint at the Human Rights Commission.

The Petitioner in the instant case, has failed neither to adduce any evidence to show that

there has been an inquiry pending before the Human Rights Commission nor made any

attempt to explain the long delay in filing his Petition.

In the above circumstances, it is apparent that there is no merit in the submissions made by

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that the Petitioner has an entitlement to maintain this

case on the strength of Paragraph 40 of his Petition.

Thus, for the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the Petitioner has failed to file the Petition in

the instant case within one-month time period specified in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

Therefore, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel for the 1st

Respondent and proceed to dismiss this Petition without costs.
