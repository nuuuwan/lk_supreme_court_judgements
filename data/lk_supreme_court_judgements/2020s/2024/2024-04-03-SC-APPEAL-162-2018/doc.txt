Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia against

the defendant, seeking specific performance of the agreement to sell the

land described in the schedule to the plaint. The defendant sought

dismissal of the action. After trial, the District Court entered judgment

for the plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed that

judgment. This Court granted leave to appeal to the defendant against

the judgment of the High Court. Before the case was taken up for

argument, the defendant died. The petitioner, namely W.W.D. Sanath

Nandana, made an application by way of petition and affidavit supported

by documents marked X, X1-X4 seeking him to be substituted in place

of the deceased defendant to proceed with this appeal on the basis that

the defendant by Deed of Gift marked X4 gifted the land in suit to him

subject to the outcome of the pending cases. The petitioner further stated

that the defendants wife predeceased the defendant and they do not have

children or legal heirs. The plaintiff objects to this application for

4

SC/APPEAL/162/2018

substitution on the basis that (a) the deed X4 is a forgery and (b) the

defendant did not have right to the land at the time of the execution of

the deed. This order is regarding substitution pending appeal.

Substitution in the District Court is mainly governed by Chapter XXV of

the Civil Procedure Code (sections 392-404). The Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2017 simplified the complicated procedure

regarding substitution by repealing sections 393 to 398 of the principal

enactment and substituting them with new provisions, as well as

amending section 27. The special feature of this amendment is to make

it compulsory for each party to file a memorandum nominating at least

one person and not more than three persons to be his legal

representatives for the purpose of proceeding with the action in the event

of his death pending final determination of the action. If the

memorandum has not been filed, the steps stipulated in the said Chapter

must be followed for substitution. The legislature introduced special

provisions to simplify the substitution procedure in partition actions too

by repealing and replacing section 81 of the Partition Law by the Partition

(Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 1997. Strict adherence to these provisions by

all District Judges could help save judicial time spent on substitutions.

Substitution in the Court of Appeal is governed by section 760A of the

Civil Procedure Code.

760A. Where at any time after the lodging of an appeal in any civil

action, proceeding or matter, the record becomes defective by reason

of the death or change of status of a party to the appeal, the Court

of Appeal may in the manner provided in the rules made by the

Supreme Court for that purpose, determine who, in the opinion of the

court, is the proper person to be substituted or entered on the record

in place of, or in addition to, the party who has died or undergone a

5

SC/APPEAL/162/2018

change of status, and the name of such person shall thereupon be

deemed to be substituted or entered of record as aforesaid.

Unlike in the proceedings before the District Court, where substitution is

governed by several sections of the Civil Procedure Code applicable at

different stages, section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code confers the

Court of Appeal wide discretion to determine, who in the opinion of the

Court is the proper person to be substituted. Section 760A does not specify

even the mode of filing an application. In the event of the death of a party,

substitution would be solely for the purpose of representing the

deceased for the limited purpose of prosecuting the appeal and no

more. The inquiry into determining the proper person under section

760A aims to ensure the continuation of the appeal despite the death or

change in status of a party and not to adjudicate upon the substantive

rights of the parties involved. (Careem v. Sivasubramaniam [2003] 2 Sri

LR 197, Chandana Hewavitharane v. Urban Development Authority [2005]

2 Sri LR 107, Kusumawathie v. Kanthi [2004] 1 Sri LR 350)

Substitution in the Supreme Court is governed by Rule 38 of the Supreme

Court Rules 1990.

38. Where at any time after the lodging of an application for special

leave to appeal, or an application under Article 126, or a notice of

appeal, or the grant of special leave to appeal, or the grant of leave

to appeal by the Court of Appeal, the record becomes defective by

reason of the death or change of status of a party to the proceedings,

the Supreme Court may, on application in that behalf made by any

person interested, or ex mero motu, require such applicant or the

petitioner or appellant, as the case may be, to place before the court

sufficient materials to establish who is the proper person to be

substituted or entered on the record in place of, or in addition to, the

party who has died or undergone a change of status;

6

SC/APPEAL/162/2018

Provided that where the party who has died or undergone a change

of status is the petitioner or appellant, as the case may be the court

may require such applicant or any party to place such material

before the court.

The court shall thereafter determine who shall be substituted or

added, and the name of such person shall thereupon be substituted

or added, and entered on the record as aforesaid. Nothing

hereinbefore contained shall prevent the Supreme Court itself ex

mero motu, where it thinks necessary, from directing the substitution

or addition of the person who appears to the court to be the proper

person therefor.

The application for substitution can be made by any person interested,

not necessarily a legal representative or the next of kin who has adiated

the inheritance of the deceased. Upon sufficient materials being placed

before the Court, the Court shall decide who is the proper person to be

substituted. The Court can also ex mero motu direct the substitution of a

person who appears to the court to be the proper person therefor.

When it comes to substitution in appellate proceedings, the Court is not

trammeled by technicalities. Substitution will not confer the party

substituted the status of legal heir of the deceased party. Therefore, it is

not necessary to include all heirs as substituted parties. Substitution is

solely for the purpose of prosecuting the appeal. Spending excessive

judicial time on substitution is unnecessary unless the Court thinks that

the application is mala fide. (Seelawathie v. Sumanawathie

(SC/APPEAL/199/2014, SC Minutes of 22.06.2017), Edandukitha

Gnanasiri Thero v. Dellawa Suneetha Thero (SC/HCCA/LA/378/2017,

SC Minutes of 08.03.2022), Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi Thero v. Ven.

Kotapola Amarakiththi Thero (SC/APPEAL/144/2019, SC Minutes of

31.10.2023)

SC/APPEAL/162/2018

As previously stated, the plaintiff objects to the application for

substitution on the grounds that the deed produced by the petitioner is

a fraudulent document, and in any event, the defendant did not have any

rights to the land at the time of the execution of the deed. Those matters

are beyond the scope not only of this inquiry but also of the main appeal.

X4 is a deed which appears to have been notarially executed and

registered at the Land Registry over 11 years prior to the defendants

death.

Taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I overrule the

objection of the plaintiff and hold that the petitioner is a proper person

to be substituted in place of the deceased defendant for the purpose of

prosecuting this appeal. The costs of this inquiry will abide the final

outcome of the appeal.
