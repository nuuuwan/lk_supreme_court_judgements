"Respondent had relied on the Judgment of this Court in SC/Appeal/11/2024, marked"
"R 14(a). It is the position of the 14th Respondent that this Court in that Judgment"
"had commented on the practice of preparing Judgments by ‘copying and pasting’ the"
"contents  of  the  written  submissions  filed  by  parties.  The  same  practice  had  been"
"adopted in the impugned Judgment in that case pronounced by a Bench of the Court"
"of Appeal comprising the Nominee Judge. The 14th Respondent claims that this too"
"should have been a ground for the Constitutional Council to disapprove the nomination"
"of such judges for appointment to the apex court. It is relevant to note that this Court"
"in the said appeal had to say the following about the Judgment pronounced by the"
"majority of a Divisional Bench of the Court of Appeal of which the Nominee Judge was"
"the Presiding Judge."
