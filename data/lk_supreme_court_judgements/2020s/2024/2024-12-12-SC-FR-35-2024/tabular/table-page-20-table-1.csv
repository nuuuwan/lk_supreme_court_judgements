ke Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion.’  This analogy is drawn from an incident"
"in 67 BC where Roman Emperor Julius Caesar divorced his wife Pompeia based merely"
"on rumours of her adultery with no actual proof as to whether adultery was indeed"
"committed, saying “Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.”"

"j

"based on some evidence would be enough to taint the public trust reposed in a Judge."
"B
e that as it may, a Judge must decide each case based on the facts of that case,"
"applying the relevant law in its correct perspective. If a Judge decides a case based"
"on extraneous reasons, then he is not performing his duties in accordance with the"
"law. After all, an appellate Court may only rectify an apparent judicial mistake, for it"
"would not under normal circumstances be always possible to sense whether the Judge"
"had also considered extraneous reasons when deciding a particular case. Thus, it is"
"not  unreasonable  to  expect  such  a  high  standard  from  a  person  who  is  being"
"considered for an appointment as a Judge of the Superior Courts of the country as"
"such a Judge would be exercising extensive powers of varied nature. This assumes"
"much more importance when appointments are considered for Judges of the Supreme"

"Judgments of the Supreme Court."
