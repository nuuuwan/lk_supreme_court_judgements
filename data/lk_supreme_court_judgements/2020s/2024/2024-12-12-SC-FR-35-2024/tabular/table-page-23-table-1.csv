"W
hen the matter was taken up for support on 15-06-2023, the learned Senior State"
"Counsel  for  the  Respondents  had  raised  certain  preliminary  objections.  The  Junior"
"Counsel who had appeared for the Petitioner had moved for a postponement of the"
"case indicating that the learned President’s Counsel appearing for the Petitioner was"
"‘indisposed’."
"D
espite the afore-stated application, being satisfied that the Petitioner before them"
"would not be prejudiced as he was well represented and would have the opportunity"
"of responding to the submissions on the next date, the Bench comprising Hon. Justice"
"Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Hon. Justice M. A. R. Marikar had unanimously decided to"
"allow the learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents to raise those preliminary"
"objections. Accordingly, the learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents appears"
"to have concluded the submissions with regard to the said preliminary objection. This"
"was followed by the submissions of Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena PC, who had appeared"
"for some parties seeking intervention in the case. Thereafter, that bench had fixed the"
"matter to be resumed before the same bench on 21-06-2023."
"W
hen the case came up before the same Bench on 21-06-2023, the Petitioner who"
"had right throughout agitated that the case must be heard as an extremely urgent"
"matter,  unexpectedly  moved  to  withdraw  the  Petition  with  no  prior  indication  and"
"without sufficient or legitimate reason. The written submissions had alleged that up"
"until that time, there was no indication whatsoever that the Petitioner would want to"
"withdraw that case. The fact that the Petitioner had moved Court to take up the case"
"for  hearing  on  urgent  basis  initially  must  be  noted  as  a  significant  factor  at  this"
"juncture.  Accordingly,  the  bench  comprising  Hon.  Justice  Sobhitha  Rajakaruna  and"
"Hon.  Justice  M.  A.  R.  Marikar  had  allowed  the  application  for  withdrawal  and  the"
"matter was pro-forma dismissed. I must reiterate that it was the Petitioner who was"
"eager to prevent his arrest as fast as possible who just on the second date of hearing"
"had withdrawn the Petition giving no reason for such withdrawal. What follows next"
"will  confirm  the  suspicion  that  anyone  would  likely  to  have  entertained  about  the"
"Petitioner’s withdrawal of that case in the aforesaid circumstances."
