BEFORE : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA, J.

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

COUNSEL : Saliya Pieris, PC with Susil Wanigapura for the 2nd and 4th

Defendant-Petitioner-Appellants.

Prince Perera, Bhashini Dassanayake with Udara

Thilakawardena instructed by Nadeeka Gurusinghe for the

Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent.

ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 01-07-2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd and 4th

Defendant-Petitioner-Appellants and also the submissions of the learned Counsel for

the Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent and concluded the argument of this

case.

The Plaintiff has filed the action relevant to the instant appeal in the District Court

seeking to partition the land referred to in the Plaint.

After the trial, the learned District Judge deciding to partition the land, has pronounced

the Judgment dated 13-05-2002 and directed that the Interlocutory Decree be

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 10 of 15

10

entered. The Court then issued a commission on the Surveyor to take steps to submit

the Scheme of Partition. The Surveyor thereafter, had submitted the Scheme of

Partition which has been produced in this proceeding, marked P9 A (Plan No. 422B

prepared by A. Weerasinghe, Licensed Surveyor).

Upon the 2nd and 4th Defendants objecting to the said Scheme of Partition (P9 A), the

learned District Judge had conducted an inquiry. It was in that process that the 2nd

and 4th Defendants had submitted an alternative Scheme of Partition which has been

produced in this proceeding, marked P9 B (Plan No. 265A, dated 15-10-2007,

prepared by Weeraddana Kamalasena, Licensed Surveyor).

After the inquiry, the learned District Judge by his Order dated 14-01-2011, had

decided to reject the alternative Scheme of Partition P9 B submitted on behalf of the

2nd and 4th Defendants and decided to accept the Scheme of Partition as per the Plan

422B (P9 A) which was the Scheme of Partition originally proposed by the Court

Commissioner.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 14-01-2011, pronounced by the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle, the 2nd and 4th Defendants had filed a Leave to

Appeal Petition before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. The Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeals having considered the submissions at the support stage of the

case had refused to grant Leave to Appeal to the said Petition by its Order dated 16-

07-2013.

Being aggrieved by the Order dated 16-07-2013, pronounced by the Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeals, the 2nd and 4th Defendants have filed the Leave to Appeal

Petition relevant to this appeal in this Court.

Upon the said Leave to Appeal Petition being supported, this Court by its Order dated

21-07-2015, had decided to grant Leave to Appeal in respect of the questions of law

set out in Paragraphs 18(c), 18(d), 18(e), 18(f), and 18(g) of the Petition dated 22-

08-2013. The said questions of law are reproduced (in verbatim) below:

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 11 of 15

11

c) Did the Hon. High Court Judges fail to consider that the learned Additional

District Judge of Galle did not apply the principle of fairness which ought to be

present in a Scheme of Partition?

d) Did the Hon. High Court Judges and the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle fail to consider that the plan bearing No: 422B dated 7th of December

2006 has significantly failed to provide a fair Scheme of Partition which is

detrimental to the Petitioners, whereas plan bearing No. 265A dated 15th

October 2007 presents a fairer Scheme of Partition?

e) Did the Hon. High Court Judges fail to consider that the Commissioner A.

Weerasinges plan No. 422B allocates road frontage of the corpus of the

Partition Action only to the 1st Respondent while the Surveyor Weeraddana

Kamalasenas plan No. 265A allocates road frontage to all the lots of the

corpus?

f) Did the Hon. High Court Judges fail to consider that allocating 4.5 perches of

land from the corpus to provide a road way is unnecessary and unfair waste of

land?

g) Did the Hon. High Court Judges fail to consider that the Partition Scheme

adopted by the learned Additional District Judge will result in the shares of land

being allotted to the Petitioners to become each split into two different lots

from two different places some of which cannot be put to any use according to

law?

Having considered the submissions made by the learned Counsel for both parties, we

take the view that it would suffice for us to provide answers only to the questions of

law set out in afore-stated Paragraphs 18(c), 18(d), and 18(g) of the Petition.

Mr. Saliya Peiris, PC, for the 2nd and 4th Defendants brought to our notice that several

sub-divided lots of the corpus are of very small extents. Some of such lots could be

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 12 of 15

12

identified as follows: Lot No. 09, the extent of which is 1.6 perches; Lot No. 04, the

extent of which is 2.9 perches; Lot No. 06, the extent of which is 1.3 perches; Lot No.

07, the extent of which is 0.4 perches; Lot No. 08, the extent of which is 0.4 perches;

Lot No. 10, the extent of which is 2.8 perches; Lot No. 11, the extent of which is 1.7

perches.

We observe that the afore-mentioned Scheme of Partition would result in allotting to

the parties, the extents which would become less than the minimum extent required

to be maintained by written law regulating the sub-division of lands for development

purposes. This is a requirement in terms of Section 31 (2) of the Partition Law (as

amended by Act No. 17 of 1997). It is also pertinent in this regard to refer to Section

32 of Partition Law which is reproduced below.

Section 32, Partition Law.

(1) The surveyor shall make his return to the commission, verified by affidavit,

substantially in the form set out in the Second Schedule to this Law, on or

before the returnable date or the extended date (as the case may be) fixed

under section 27, and together with such return he shall transmit to the court-

(a) the plan of partition prepared by him, in duplicate;

(b) a certified copy of his field notes;

(c) a report, in duplicate, explaining the manner in which the land

has been partitioned stating the names of the parties, the nature

and extent of their respective shares and interests and where any

such extent is less than the minimum extent required by any

written law relating to sub-division of land for development

purposes, a statement to that effect, the dates on which the land

was partitioned, and, where a lot is allotted in common to several

parties, specifying each party's share of that lot;

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 13 of 15

13

(d) the appraised value of each lot and of any improvements thereon

and where the Court has directed the Commissioner to allot

portions of land together as one lot under section 26, the

appraised valuation of portions considered as one lot, and any

improvements thereon and the details of the computation of such

value ; and

(e) a summary of distribution, such report, appraisement, summary

and certificate being substantially in the form set out in the

Second Schedule to this Law.

(f) a certificate to the effect that the plan of partition is in conformity

with written law relating to the subdivision of land for

development purposes

(2) Where no provision is made in the interlocutory decree for the allotment of

a lot in common, the surveyor shall not allot a lot in common to any parties

without the written consent of those parties.

Thus, where the extent of any sub-divided lot is less than the minimum extent required

by any written law relating to sub-division of land for development purposes, Section

32 (1) (c) requires the Surveyor to include in his return to the commission, which must

be verified by an affidavit, a statement to that effect.

Similarly, Section 32 (1) (f) requires the Surveyor to include in his return to the

commission, which must be verified by an affidavit, a certificate to the effect that the

plan of partition is in conformity with written law relating to the subdivision of land for

development purposes.

We also observe that the Surveyor is obliged in terms of Section 32 (1) (d) of Partition

Law, to divide the corpus as far as practicable, in such a manner as would enable the

allotment to a party to be made as one lot.

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 14 of 15

14

We observe that the Court Commissioner has failed to comply with Section 32 (1) (c),

Section 32 (1) (d) and Section 32 (1) (f) of Partition Law when preparing the proposed

Scheme of Partition as per P9 A and his report.

There is no dispute by parties before us, that the aforementioned extents of the afore-

mentioned small portions are less than the minimum extent required to be maintained

by written law regulating the subdivision of lands for development purposes.

Therefore, the Scheme of Partition as per P9 A is contrary to Section 31 (2) of Partition

Law as amended.

Thus, as regards the report submitted by the Court Commissioner, we observe that

the bear averment in his affidavit that he partitioned the corpus in accordance with

Section 32 of Partition Law is incorrect.

Moreover, there is no material before Court to satisfy itself that it is in fact possible

for the respective allottees of these small portions, to use these small portions of land

for some use other than for development purposes, once the possession of those lots

are handed over to them. In that sense, it is not only the 2nd and 4th Defendants who

have chosen to come before us, but the other respective parties to whom the other

small portions have been allotted, would also get adversely affected by the Scheme

of Partition (P9 A) which the learned Additional District Judge of Galle has accepted.

Therefore, it is in the best interest of all such parties that the Court should reject the

Scheme of Partition (P9 A) and take steps to get a fresh Scheme of Partition prepared.

The learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals have failed to

appreciate these aspects of the case.

For the foregoing reasons, we answer the afore-mentioned questions of law as follows.

I. Answer to the question of law set out in 18(c).

In the affirmative.

[SC Appeal 124/2015] - Page 15 of 15

15

II. Answer to the question of law set out in 18(d).

The learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals and the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle have failed to appreciate that the Plan bearing

No. 422B dated 11th of December 2006, has significantly failed to provide a fair

Scheme of Partition.

III. Answer to the question of law set out in 18(g).

The learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals and the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle have failed to appreciate that the Scheme of

Partition adopted by the learned Additional District Judge of Galle will result in

small plots of land being allotted to some parties which are scattered in different

places and hence cannot be put to an effective use according to law.

Accordingly, we decide to set aside the Order dated 16-07-2013, pronounced by the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals and also set aside the Order dated 14-01-2011,

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Galle.

We direct the learned Additional District Judge to take steps to get a fresh Scheme of

Partition prepared according to law.
