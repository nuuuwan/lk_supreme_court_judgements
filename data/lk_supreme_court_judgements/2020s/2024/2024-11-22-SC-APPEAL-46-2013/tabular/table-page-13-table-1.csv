"[27] For the forgoing reasons, I answer the 1st Question of Law quoted at the beginning of this"
"Judgment in the affirmative in favour of the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant. 2nd Question of"
"Law mentioned above has to be answered stating that ‘no, the Court of Appeal has considered the"
"validity of deed No. 52081 but failed to consider the validity of the deed No. 1549’. Third Question"
"of Law has to be answered in the affirmative as Court of Appeal erred as explained above in this"
"judgment."
"[28]  For  the  sake  of  completeness,  it  is  necessary  to  note  an  erroneous  statement  made  in  the"
"District  Court Judgment. The learned District  Court Judge has stated that he does not  consider"
"documents marked P1 to P 7 as they have not tendered to Court at the end of the trial. Once a"
"document is marked it become part and parcel of the case record and he should have called the"
"relevant  parties  to  file  them  before  the  judgment.  However,  it  appears,  the  Plaintiffs  being  the"
"Appellants to Court of Appeal have failed to tender them even to the Appeal brief of the Court of"
"Appeal.  If  they  were  tendered  to  Court  of Appeal,  they  could  have  been  part  of  this  brief  too."
"However, as per the evidence recorded those documents can be described as follows;"
"P1- birth certificate of a child of Albert, P2 to P5 – Acreage tax receipts, P6- a deed executed by"
"the Plaintiffs allegedly with the 2nd Defendant, using her name as stated in the plaint which the 2nd"
"Defendant does not agree, for a different land, P 7- a birth certificate of one Hinnihamy born in"
"1940, thus, who cannot be the 2nd Defendant."
"Even if those documents were tendered and considered, they cannot prove the title of the Plaintiffs"
"or their adverse possession against the defendants."
"[29] Therefore, I set aside the Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 07.12.2010 and restore the"
"final  conclusion  of  the  Learned  District  Judge  contained  in  the  judgment  dated  23.08.1996  to"
"dismiss the plaint while declaring title of the 1st Defendant to the land mentioned in the schedule"
"to the plaint."
"[30] Hence, this Appeal allowed. The 1st defendant is entitled to the costs in all 3 Courts."
