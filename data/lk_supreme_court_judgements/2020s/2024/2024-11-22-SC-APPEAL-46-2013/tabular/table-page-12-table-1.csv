"property  –  vide  pages  150,  153  of  the  brief.  If  there  was  adverse  possession  against  the  2nd"
"Defendant, the Plaintiffs should have taken such a position in the plaint itself. Not taking such"
"position  in  the  plaint  itself  shows  that  there  was  no  such  adverse  possession  against  the  2nd"
"Defendant. On the other hand, Plaintiffs cannot be allowed to change their stance at different"
"stages of the action. Their stance according to the plaint was that they have become co-owners"
"along with the 2nd Defendant inheriting from their father and have prescriptive title along with"
"the 2nd Defendant  against  the 1st Defendant. As such they cannot  be allowed to change their"
"stance and claim prescription against the 2nd Defendant to claim prescriptive title against the 1st"
"Defendant. Hence, no sufficient material was placed to prove an overt act and commencement"
"of adverse possession."
"[23] For the reasons discussed above, it is clear that the learned Court of Appeal Judge erred in"
"allowing the appeal made by the Plaintiffs and setting aside the District Court judgment."
"[24] As indicated above, the learned District Court judge has correctly found that even though"
"the 2nd Defendant has been referred in different names, it is the same person. Learned Court of"
"Appeal judge has not decided otherwise. Even the Court of Appeal, by admitting that the rights"
"of the 2nd Defendant devolved on the 1st Defendant, has indirectly admitted that the name Baba"
"Hamy Jayawathie mentioned in  1V1 refers to  the  2nd  Defendant.  In V2,  birth certificate,  her"
"name has been mentioned as Baba Hamy Yasawathie. However, there was no dispute that Albert"
"had only one child from his first marriage. Thus, it should be her birth certificate. She has been"
"named in the plaint as Narawala Gamage Dayawathie and the 1st Plaintiff has not disputed one"
"who appeared and gave evidence is anyone other than her sister from her father’s first marriage."
"The Plaintiffs’ witness has referred to her as Hinnihamy. Thus, even though there are differences"
"in the said names, they refer to the one and the same person, namely the 2nd Defendant."
"[25] As explained above, the learned Court of Appeal Judge failed to consider the 2nd Defendant’s"
"paper title concerning the disputed land as well as that there was no sufficient material to establish"
"prescriptive title of the Plaintiffs against the 2nd Defendant."
"[26] The 1st Defendant had purchased the said land from the 2nd Defendant who became the owner"
"after Albert through Deed No. 1549."
