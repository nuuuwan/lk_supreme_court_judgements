"call necessary witnesses. On the other hand, what the plaint has stated is that the 2nd Defendant"
"is a co-owner along with the Plaintiffs and they all inherited the land from their father Albert"
"and also have prescriptive title to the land in question. However, the 2nd Defendant has filed her"
"answer and given evidence that she transferred her ownership to the 1st Defendant. Thus, there"
"is no sufficient material to state that said deed No.52801 is a fraudulent deed. In that context,"
"the Court of Appeal’s conclusion which indicates that the ownership that the 2nd Defendant had,"
"should devolve on the 1st Defendant is correct to that extent."
"[16] Even though the learned Court of Appeal Judge has referred to deed No. 1549 executed in"
"1939 in her judgment, there is a glaring failure in the Court of Appeal judgment as it does not"
"reveal why the transfer of ownership by said Albert through that deed was not accepted by the"
"Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal has not considered whether it is a valid deed or not. As"
"said before, this Deed No.1549 has not been revealed and challenged in the plaint. Once it was"
"revealed through answers of the Defendants, neither a replication has been filed to challenge the"
"claim made by the 1st Defendant based on that nor has raised any issue challenging the validity"
"of  that  deed. When  it  was  marked  as  2V3,  no  objection  was  raised  by  the  Plaintiffs  and,  no"
"objection,  if  there  was  any,  was  reiterated  by  the  Plaintiff  at  the  close  of  the  case  of  the"
"Defendants. Thus, 2V3 has to be considered as a proved document and was evidence for the all"
"purposes of the case. Furthermore, it was more than 30 years old at the time it was marked and"
"tendered in evidence. Thus, it can be presumed that it is a genuine deed. During the trial, the"
"Plaintiffs  have  attempted  to  indicate  that  when  that  deed  No.1549  was  executed,  the  2nd"
"Defendant was only 4 years old and as such she could not have paid the consideration mentioned"
"in  the  deed.  Consideration  could  even  have  been  paid  by  another  person.  However,  the  1st"
"Defendant had stated that her father Albert sold a land of which her mother, first wife of Albert"
"had ownership and the money that should have come to her had been used as consideration for"
"the transaction in deed No.1549. There was no issue raised challenging deed No.1549 and also"
"no sufficient material to find that it is not valid. Hence, the 2nd Defendant became the sole owner"
"of the land in issue after the execution of the deed No.1549. Therefore, the learned Court of"
"Appeal judge’s conclusion which indicates that the Plaintiffs inherited the land along with the"
"1st Defendant is incorrect and the said learned judge of the Court of Appeal erred in that regard."
