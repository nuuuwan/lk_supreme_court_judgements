"23.08.1996  by  its  judgment  dated  07.12.2010.  In  the  penultimate  paragraph  of  the  Court  of"
"Appeal judgment, the learned Court of Appeal judge has held as follows;"
"“The plaintiff /appellants are claiming title through the same source. And the learned trial judge"
"has misdirected himself when he stated in the impugned judgment that, as the plaintiffs/appellant"
"have admitted in evidence the prescriptive title of the 2nd defendant, they cannot now deny the"
"claim  of  the  2nd  defendant.  The  correct  approach  is  that  as  elicited  by  the  evidence  the  2nd"
"defendant also has a claim to this land from his father. The plaintiffs/appellants along with the"
"2nd  defendant  have  rights  to  this  property  as  heirs  of  the  said  Albert.  Therefore,  the  1st"
"defendant/respondent can claim only the share of what the 2nd defendant/respondent would"
"be entitled, as co-owner of this land.” (highlighted by me)"
"[13] The above highlighted portion of the Court of Appeal judgment clearly indicates that the"
"learned  Court  of Appeal  Judge  accepted  the  transfer  made  by  the  2nd  Defendant  to  the  1st"

"[14] Even for the sake of argument,  if it is  considered as true that the view of the  Court of"
"Appeal  that  the  Plaintiffs  are  co-owners  along  with  the  1st  Defendant  is  correct  (in  fact  as"
"explained below which is incorrect), the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the Plaintiffs’"

"land in the manner described in the plaint which in essence was a plaint in a rei vindicatio action."
"[15] When deed No. 52081 (V1) was tendered in evidence for the first time, Court has rejected"
