"[17] In the backdrop described above, to succeed the Plaintiffs should have proved prescriptive"
"title  against  the  1st  Defendant.  The  1st  Defendant  bought  the  land  by  deed  No.  52081  on"
"06.06.1989. The action was filed on 25.05 1990. Thus, without proving the commencement of"
"adverse possession ten years prior to the filing of the action in the District Court against the 2nd"
"Defendant, the predecessor in title to the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiffs cannot succeed. As the"
"learned  District  Judge  correctly  observed,  the  Plaintiffs  have  admitted  ownership  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant in their plaint. As such they cannot be said to have an adverse possession against the"
"2nd Defendant."
"[18] On the other hand, it is not in dispute that Albert, father of the 1st and 3rd Plaintiffs and the"
"2nd Defendant, became the owner of the subject matter as a result of the final Judgment in the"
"partition action no. 32217. Thus, the Plaintiffs have naturally commenced their occupation of"
"the  land  during  their  father’s  time  along  with  the  2nd  Defendant.  Due  to  the  close  family"
"relationship,  it  can  be  presumed  that  such  occupation  commenced  under  their  father, Albert."
"Albert transferred the title to the 2nd Defendant in 1939, who was a child at that time. As her"
"father he was the lawful guardian and, hence, the said occupation of the land by the Plaintiffs"
"could have been continued under their father in the same capacity as there is no proof of an overt"
"act  changing  the  nature  of  their  occupation  to  commence  an  adverse  possession.  Even  their"
"father, Albert, after executing the deed of transfer in favour of the 2nd Defendant  could have"
"continued to possess as the lawful guardian admitting the title of the 1st Defendant and as such"
"the Plaintiffs were still continuing occupation under their father."
"[19] A person who has entered into possession of land in one capacity is presumed to continue"
"to  possess  it  in  the  same  capacity-  vide  Corea  Vs  Iseris  Appuhamy  15  N  L  R  65  and"
"Tillekeratne Vs Bastian 21 N L R 12. The pith and substance of ‘adverse possession’ is that its"
"basis is  incompatible with  the owner’s title1. Thus, a person who  enters  into  possession  in  a"
"manner which is not incompatible with the title of the owner needs to prove the change of the"
"nature of his possession by proving an overt act or series of acts indicative of a challenge to the"
"title of the owner. See Government Agent, Western Province Vs Perera 11 N L R 337 at 343,"
"Lebbe Marikkar Vs Salim 71 N L R 97, Navaratne Vs Jayatunge 44 N L R 517, Siyaneris"
