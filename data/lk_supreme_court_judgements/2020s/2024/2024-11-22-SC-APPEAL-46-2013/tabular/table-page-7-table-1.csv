"","Yasawathie and she has been identified by several names. One who came to Courts as"
"","the 2nd Defendant has been identified by the 1st Plaintiff as the only child from the first"
"","marriage of her father, Albert. Thus, whatever the name used in the plaint, it is proved"
"","that said Babahamy Yasawathie is the child born out of the first wedlock of said Albert,"
"","the father of the 1st,3rd Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant."
"","It was not  put  in  issue or challenged by  the  Plaintiff in  their plaint  or through issues"
"","raised at the trial that whether a deed has been executed in favour of the 2nd Defendant"
"","by the aforesaid Albert or that such deed, if executed, is a valid deed."
"","Evidence led at the trial indicates that the 1st Plaintiff had attempted to pretend while"
"","giving  evidence  that  she  was  unaware  that  her  father  conveyed  the  land  to  the  2nd"
"","Defendant but she actually knew it."
"","The Plaintiffs have not challenged the deed No.1549(2V3) which conveyed title to the"
"","2nd Defendant on the basis that their father did not sign it. The evidence clarifies how the"
"","consideration was paid. When one considers the evidence led at the trial as a whole, there"
"","is sufficient material to establish that said Albert during his life time conveyed the subject"
"","matter to the 2nd Defendant by deed No. 1549 (2V3)."
"","The aforesaid 2nd Defendant has transferred her rights to the 1st Defendant by deed No."
"","52081  (1V1)  and  it  cannot  be  accepted  that  the  said  deed  No.  52081  is  a  fraudulent"
"","document as the evidence of the 2nd Defendant stating that she transferred her rights to"
"","the 1st Defendant has not been challenged by any means. Hence, it has been proved that"
"","the  1st  Defendant  became  the  title  holder  to  the  subject  matter  through  the  said  deed"
"","marked 1V1."
"","The  Plaintiffs  in  their  plaint  admitted  that  the  2nd  Defendant’s  ownership  to  the  land"
"","along with them. Thus, if the Plaintiffs have enjoyed the fruits of the property, it is with"
"","the consent of the 2nd Defendant. Thus, it is not established that the Plaintiffs had adverse"
"","possession  against  the  2nd  Defendant  and  therefore,  the  claim  of  the  Plaintiffs  for"
"","prescriptive title has not been proved."
