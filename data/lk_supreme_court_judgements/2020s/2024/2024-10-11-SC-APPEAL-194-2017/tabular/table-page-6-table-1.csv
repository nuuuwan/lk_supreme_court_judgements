"","explicitly  granting 
leave  to  proceed 
in  the  Supreme  Court,  along  with  a  clear"
"","specification  of  the  questions  of  law  upon  which  such  leave  was  granted.  In  the"
"","absence of this essential order, the procedural requirements necessary for the proper"
"","consideration of the appeal by the Supreme Court have not been met. This omission"

"","question as to whether there was a proper leave to proceed application filed before"
"","the High Court, on or before the 30th April 2024. In response to which, both parties"

"","provides  the  procedure  applicable  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  when  granting  leave  to"
"","appeal to the Supreme Court, shall analogously be applicable to the High Court of"
