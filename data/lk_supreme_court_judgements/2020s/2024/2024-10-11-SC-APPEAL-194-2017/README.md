THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Suspect-Appellant-Appellant, Devanayagam Wasanthi (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellant), and the 2nd Suspect, Manikkawasagam Sukumar were charged

before the Magistrates Court of Matale with cheating punishable under Section 403

of the Penal Code. The charges stemmed from three separate incidents in which they

presented fake gold jewellery to Weerasighe Mudiyanselage Nimal Weerasinghe,

Deputy Manager of People's Bank, Matale Branch and fraudulently obtained sums

totaling Rs. 46,500/ from him. Initially, the charges were framed in 2007, and after

several amendments, the case proceeded with the prosecution's evidence, including

testimonies from bank officials and experts. The Magistrates Court of Matale found

the Appellant guilty on all counts in November 2012 and sentenced her to one year of

rigorous imprisonment for each charge.

2. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the Appellant appealed to the High Court

of Kandy, arguing, inter alia, procedural irregularities, erroneous evaluation of

evidence, and the failure to consider her lack of prior convictions. The High Court

dismissed the appeal in September 2017. Aggrieved by the said dismissal, the

Appellant submitted documents purporting to be a petition for leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court, challenging the conviction, particularly the validity of one charge due

to a clerical error regarding the date of the offence.

3. When this matter was taken before the Supreme Court on the 25th March 2024 having

been fixed for argument following multiple postponements for various reasons

recorded, the counsel for the Appellant submitted that the purported Petition of

appeal dated 19th September 2017 was filed in the High Court of Kandy and that leave

was granted by the High Court.

4. However, on the 25th March 2024 when this matter was taken up, the Court observed

that no judicial order was found granting leave to proceed in the Supreme Court based

with specified questions of law or grounds of appeal and that the Petition does not

SC Appeal 194/2017 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 10

refer to any leave to proceed having been obtained from the High Court. The journal

entry dated 22.09.2017 of the High Court case record merely directs the registry of the

High Court of Kandy to file the documents pertaining to the petition of appeal. It notes

that the purported petition of appeal was submitted within the prescribed time and

orders its prompt referral to the Supreme Court, while retaining a copy of the docket.

Notably, the journal entry does not mention any application for leave but simply

requests that the petition be forwarded to the Supreme Court. The aforementioned

journal entry dated 22.09.2017 of the High Court case record is reproduced below,

[22.09.2017

Ms. Sunanda Withanage, Attorney-at-Law for the Defendant-Appellant, has

sought to file a petition of appeal to be referred to the Supreme Court against the

order dated 06.09.2017.

1. File the Relevant documents

2. The Petition of Appeal was submitted within the prescribed period.

Accordingly, I order that it be promptly referred to the Supreme Court, while

retaining a copy of the docket.

5. The Court observes that the High Court Judge of Kandy has failed to issue an order

explicitly granting leave to proceed in the Supreme Court, along with a clear

specification of the questions of law upon which such leave was granted. In the

absence of this essential order, the procedural requirements necessary for the proper

consideration of the appeal by the Supreme Court have not been met. This omission

constitutes a significant procedural irregularity, thereby affecting the admissibility of

the appeal. As a consequence, the jurisdiction of this Court has not been properly

invoked.

6. The Court further directed both parties to file written submissions only on the

question as to whether there was a proper leave to proceed application filed before

the High Court, on or before the 30th April 2024. In response to which, both parties

have duly assisted the court by filing their written submissions before the specified

date.

7. In the Appellants written submission, she submits that the High Court of the

Provinces exercise concurrent criminal appellate jurisdiction together with the Court

of Appeal. Hence, Section B of Part 1 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 which

provides the procedure applicable to the Court of Appeal when granting leave to

appeal to the Supreme Court, shall analogously be applicable to the High Court of

the Provinces in granting leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Thereby submitting

that the registrar of the High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy, by

transmitting the entire case record of the proceedings to the Supreme Court has acted

1 Translation added

SC Appeal 194/2017 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 10

in due compliance with Rule 24 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 and allowed

appeal to Supreme Court.

8. The Appellant apart from addressing the above, has made submissions at length on

the substantive facts of the case and the flaws in the judgment of the learned

Magistrate when deciding on the charges of the main matter, stating, that the High

Court has granted leave to appeal as a substantial question of law was raised in the

Petition of Appeal.

9. Thereby the appellant submits that the High Court of the Central Province has granted

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court upon the substantial question of law as

aforesaid, pursuant to the Rule 20(1) and Rule 24 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990,

and that the procedure for Special leave to appeal has no application to the instant

matter.

10. However, the Court observes that the aforementioned substantial questions of law

submitted by the Appellant in the latest written submission filed pursuant to the

direction on 25th March 2024, have neither been raised in the Petition of the Appellant

to the Supreme Court nor in the Petition of the Appellant to the High Court of Kandy.

11. Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990

(The Act) provides for the procedure in filing appeals from the final orders,

judgments, or sentences of the High Court. Section 9 of the Act provides that,

Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person aggrieved by-

a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction

vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or

section 3 of this Act or any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether

civil or criminal which involves a substantial question of law, may

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court if the High Court grants leave to

SC Appeal 194/2017 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 10

appeal to the Supreme Court ex mero motu or at the instance of any

aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings :

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave

to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory order,

judgment, decree or sentence made by such High Court, in the exercise of

the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P

of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act, or another law where such High

Court has refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, or where

in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for review by

the Supreme Court :

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in

every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the question to be

decided is of public or general importance; and

b) a final order, judgment or sentence of a High Court established by Article

154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction conferred on it by

paragraph (3)(a), or (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution may appeal

therefrom to the Court of Appeal.

12. In the present case, the substantial questions of law now presented were not part of

the original petitions before either the Supreme Court or the High Court. As such,

these questions were never considered by the High Court in its decision to grant leave,

thus failing to satisfy the condition laid out in Section 9(a) of the Act.

13. Therefore, the failure to raise these substantial questions of law at the appropriate

stage in the appellate process results in a procedural deficiency. The Court is bound

by the provisions of the Act, and without leave granted by the High Court on these

specific questions of law, this court lacks the jurisdiction to hear and determine the

instant appeal.

SC Appeal 194/2017 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 10

14. As held in W.M.W.P.K. Amarasekara v. Nagaratnam Ratnakumara,2 by K.

Priyantha Fernando, J., once an application to grant a leave to appeal is made, it is

incumbent upon the High Court to specify the substantial question of law on which

leave is granted. Since no such order is made by the High Court judge in the instant

case specifying the questions of law, the appellant has failed to properly invoke the

jurisdiction of this court. I am of concurrence with my brother on the above decision

held in the aforementioned case.

15. Thus, in view of the procedural deficiencies noted, particularly the failure to properly

raise the substantial questions of law at the appropriate stage and the absence of a

judicial order from the High Court granting leave to appeal with specific questions of

law, the Court finds that the Appellant has not complied with the procedural

requirements under Section 9(a) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990. The Appellant has not properly invoked the jurisdiction

of this Court. Therefore, the appeal is rejected.

Appeal Dismissed.
