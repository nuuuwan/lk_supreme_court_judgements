"W
hen analyzing the above evidence, it is quite clear that the Original Plaintiff had past experiences in"
"taking loans and transferring land. Therefore, it is quite difficult to assume that the Original Plaintiff"
"was unaware of the other Deed she had to sign and reckless enough to put her signature on several"
"blank documents. In focusing on the Notaryâ€™s evidence led at the trial, the Counsel for the Plaintiff"
"has not challenged his evidence to prove that the signatures were obtained fraudulently at his office"
"moreover  as  there  is  no  complaint  against  the  Notary  or  the  Original  Defendant  that  they  have"
"obtained her signatures into several blank pages to the Police until three years have passed."
