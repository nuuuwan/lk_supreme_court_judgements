"W
hen considering the several questions of law under which the leave was granted,  the crux of the"
"matters referred to in those issues can be reduced to two main issues for the convenience of analysis."
"They are,"
"1.  Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider that the burden of proof in terms of sec"
"101 and 102 of the Evidence Ordinance rests with the Respondent to this case to prove that"
"the said Deed 5414 is fraudulent, which the Respondent has failed to discharge?"
"2.  Has  the  Judges  of  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  failed  to  appreciate  the  findings  of  the"
"Learned District Judge in relation to questions of facts as to the credibility of witnesses and"
"material placed before the Court?"
"Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider that the burden of proof in terms of sec 101 and"
"102 of the Evidence Ordinance rests with the Respondent to this case to prove that the said Deed"
"5414 is fraudulent, which the Respondent has failed to discharge?"
"In a civil case burden of proof usually rests with the proving of facts essential in establishing his"
"claim, rests on the Plaintiff as clearly stated in sec 101 and 102 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"Sec 101 of the evidence Ordinance provides that,"
"Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the"
"existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist."
"When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof"
"lies on that person."
"Section 102 of the Evidence Ordinance states:"
"The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at"
"all were given on either side."
"Sec 102 illustration (b) further elaborates on it as follows:"
"A sues B for money due on a bond. The execution of the bond is admitted, but B says that it"
"was  obtained  by  fraud,  which  A  denies.  If  no  evidence  were  given  on  either  side,  A  would"
"succeed, as the bond is  not disputed, and the fraud is not proved. Therefore, the burden of"
"proof is on B"
