Based on Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, there is a specific time period mandated for one to claim prescription and therefore it is important to establish the commencement date of the adverse possession of the land.

The surveyor has stated, 1 , 1 . . From this statement it is clear that the 1st defendant was infact intending to purchase lot No.11. If the 1st defendant had prescribed to the land, there would be no need for the 1st defendant to purchase it. This shows that even if the 1st Defendant was in possession, it was not adverse to the title of the plaintiff or his predecessor in title. 23. When the evidence indicates the contradicting positions taken by the defendant, it is his duty to prove the commencement of the adverse possession which in the instant case, the 1st defendant has failed to do so. The defendant has failed to prove that there was undisturbed adverse possession where 10 years had lapsed. Therefore, the defendants claim for prescription for Lot 4 too has failed. 24. Further, upon reviewing the 1st defendant's answer to the plaint dated 16.03.2004 [P-4a], it is observed in the prayer that the 1st defendant did not seek a counter-declaration to establish his title.
