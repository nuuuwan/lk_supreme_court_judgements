"","possession concerning Lot No. 4 leads to the conclusion that the"
"","defendant’s claim over the said property cannot be sustained."
"22.","Additionally,  it  is  important  to  consider  that  in  the  document"
"","marked [P-3a], surveyor, T.D.W.P. Perera, who prepared Survey"
"","Plan No. 1109 on commission for the 1st defendant, testified that"
"","the 1st defendant had informed him of a promise to purchase the"
"","Lot 11 in dispute from the plaintiff, but was later unable to do so"
"","for various reasons. The surveyor has stated, “… පැමිණිළිකරුට අයත්"
"","ඉඩම්  ගකාටස  මිලදීගැනීමට  1වන  විත්තිකරු  ගපාගරාන්ුවූ  බවත්,  පසුව  ගවනත්"
"","ගහේතුන්  මත  මිලදීගැනීමට  ගනාහැකිවූ    බවත්  1වන  විත්තිකරු  පවසන  ලදි…”.  ."
"","From this statement it is clear that the 1st defendant was infact"
"","intending 
to  purchase 
lot  No.11. 
If 
the  1st  defendant  had"
"","prescribed  to  the  land,  there  would  be  no  need  for  the  1st"
"","defendant 
to  purchase 
it.  This  shows 
that  even 
if 
the  1st"
"","Defendant was in possession, it was not adverse to the title of the"
"","plaintiff or his predecessor in title."
"23.  When the evidence indicates the contradicting positions taken by",""
"","the defendant, it is his duty to prove the commencement of the"
"","adverse possession which in the instant case, the 1st defendant"
"","has failed to do so. The defendant has failed to prove that there"
"","was undisturbed adverse possession where 10 years had lapsed."
"","Therefore, the defendants’ claim for prescription for Lot 4 too has"
"","failed."
"24.","Further, upon reviewing the 1st defendant's answer to the plaint"
"","dated 16.03.2004 [P-4a], it is observed in the prayer that the 1st"
"","defendant  did  not  seek  a  counter-declaration  to  establish  his"
"","title.  This  clearly  indicates  that  the  1st  defendant  is  uncertain"
"","about his position regarding prescription of the lands in question."
"","As per Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, one can establish"
"","prescriptive title only through a decree of Court."
"25.","According  to  the  evidence  submitted  in  the  District  Court,  the"
"","plaintiff  has  clearly  produced  deed  No.1001  [P-1]  without  any"
"","objection to establish his title to the property in suit. There was"
"","an admission (No.5) that, the donor of the said deed who is the"
"","mother of the plaintiff became the owner of the property in suit"
"","as  per  the  partition  decree  No.10684.  Therefore,  the  learned"
"","Judges of the Civil Appellate Hight Court have erred in arriving"
