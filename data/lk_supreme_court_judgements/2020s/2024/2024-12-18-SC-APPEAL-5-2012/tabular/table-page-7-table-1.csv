"","the original plaint as Lot 4 and acquired prescriptive title to the"
"","same."
"14.","It  was  further  contended  by  the  Counsel  for  the  1st  defendant"
"","that,  the  road  access  in  question  described  as  Lot  11  in  plan"
"","No.2234 was not physically on the ground at present and that it"
"","consists 
of 
old 
trees  and 
claimed 
that  he  has  acquired"
"","prescriptive title not only to the plaintiffâ€™s property (Lot 4) but also"
"","to Lot 11 which was given as a road access to the parties in the"
"","aforementioned partition action."
"15.","At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  1st"
"","defendant asserted that the 1st defendant has been in possession"
"","of the land since 1963 and has continued to possess it even after"
"","the partition decree of 1972. The Counsel further submitted that,"
"","since  1972,  the  mother  of  the  plaintiff  has  neither  visited  the"
"","property nor enjoyed the servitude on Lot 11."
"16.","According  to  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  1st  defendant,  the  1st"
"","defendant has prescribed to Lot 4 along with Lot 11.  Although,"
"","at first, he only received Lot 9 from the partition decree of 1972"
"","[1V2],  he  later  acquired  lots  5,6,7,8,  and  10  as  well.  Lot  11"
"","remains as a common amenity co-owned by all parties to the said"
"","partition action."
"17.","Although,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  has  stated  that,"
"","the  roadway  lot  11  acts  as  a  servitude  for  lot  4,  as  per  the"
"","partition decree of 1972,  lot 11 was declared a common amenity"
"","where  all 
the  co-owners  held  common  soil 
rights  over 
it."
"","Therefore,  lot  11  cannot  be  considered  as  a  servitude  as  one"
"","cannot  claim  a  servitude  over  his  own  land.  However,  it  is  a"
"","common access owned by all the co-owners."
"18.","Sri  Lankan  Law  has  identified  instances  where  a  co-owner  has"
"","later  prescribed 
for 
the  co-owned 
land.  However, 
in 
these"
"","instances there has been specific emphasis on the overt act done"
"","by  the  party  claiming  prescription.  The  case  of  Siyathuhamy"
"","and  others  V  Podimenike  and  others  [2004]  2  SLR  323"
"","discusses  how  there  cannot  be  prescription  among  co-owners"
