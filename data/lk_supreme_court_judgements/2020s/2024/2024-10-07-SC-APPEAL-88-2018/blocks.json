More recently, JusticeMahindaSamayawardhenainBallantudaAchchigeDonWasanthavMorawakagePremawathieandOthers[SC/Appeal/176/2014] decided on 17.05.2021 held that H.N.G.Fernando J. (later C.J.) in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR169 at 171 required strict proof of the Plaintiffs title. But this shallnot be understood that a Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall provehis title beyond reasonable doubt such as in a criminal prosecution,or on a high degree of proof as in a partition action. The standard ofproof of title is on a balance of probabilities as in any other civil suit.The stringent proof of chain of title, which is the norm in a partitionaction to prove the pedigree, is not required in a rei vindicatio action.",
