K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The application for special leave to appeal was preferred by thePlaintiff Appellant Appellant against the judgment of the Court ofAppeal dated 27.10.2014 affirming the judgment of the DistrictCourtof Colombo. Aggrieved by which the Plaintiff AppellantAppellant appealed to the Supreme Court.

Accordingly, this court by order dated 14.05.2018 granted specialleave to appeal on the following questions of law:

1. Have the Court of Appeal and the District Court erred in not

considering the presumption of title in favour of the Plaintiffson the proof that the Plaintiffs had enjoyed an earlier peacefulpossession and that subsequently they were ousted by theDefendant?2. Have the Court of Appeal and the District Court erred in not

considering that in an action for declaration of title, the Courthas the jurisdiction to declare the undivided share of thePlaintiffs and eject a trespasser from the land in dispute eventhough the action has been brought on the basis that thePlaintiffs are the owners of the land in dispute?

The facts of the case briefly are as follows:

This action was instituted by the Plaintiffs in the District Court ofColombo seeking inter alia;

a) A declaration that they are co-owners of the land morefully

described in the schedule of the plaint,b) An order ejecting the Respondent and those under him from

the land morefully described in the schedule to the plaint.c) Damages.

TheDefendantfiledananswer denying the position ofthePlaintiffs and seeking dismissal of the action on the basis that;

3

a) Ranamuka Devege John Fernando who is the predecessor in

the title of the Plaintiffs had five brothers and sistersb) The subject matter is still a co-owned property in as much as

apartitiondeedhadnotbeenexecuted even though apartition plan No.14/1932 dated 12.06.1932 prepared by H.S.Perera, Licensed Surveyor had been prepared.c) The Defendant had acquired prescriptive title to the land.

Having heard the evidence led and the documents produced at thetrial, the Learned District Court Judge delivered her judgmentdismissing the action of the Plaintiff on the basis that the cause ofaction being prescribed and that the Plaintiffs are only co-ownersand they do not own it solely.

Aggrieved by the decision, the Petitioners appealed to the Court ofAppeal against the judgment of the Learned District Judge. Afterconsidering the evidence led, the Honorable Justice of the Court ofAppeal delivered his judgment dismissing the Petitioners appeal.The Court of Appeal held that, the Plaintiff Appellants had failed toplace any evidence to show how John Fernando became entitled tothe entire land described in the schedule of the plaint, the PlaintiffAppellants came to court on the basis that they were the owners ofthe land described in the schedule of the plaint and that the Courtcannot agree with the submissions made on behalf of the PlaintiffAppellants that the Learned District Judge had erred in law in notgranting the lesser relief that the reliefs asked for by the PlaintiffAppellants and the ejectment of the Defendant Respondent.

Aggrieved by the decision of the Court of Appeal the PlaintiffAppellant Petitioner by petition dated 24th November 2014 soughtspecial leave to appeal from this court. Accordingly, special leave toappeal was granted by this court on 14th May 2018.

Now I will proceed to answer the 1st question of law on whichspecial leave has been granted. Namely, Have the Court of Appealand the District Court erred in not considering the presumption of

4

title in favour of the Plaintiffs on the proof that the Plaintiffs hadenjoyed earlier peaceful possession and that subsequently theywere ousted by the Defendant.

In order to answer this question of law I must first evaluate howtheownershipderivedonthePlaintiffAppellantsAppellants(hereinafter referred to as Appellant).

It was the Appellant's contention that one Ranamuka Devage JohnFernando acquired title to the land which is the corpus of thisaction by virtue of Deed of Transfer No.16947 dated 20.10.1935attestedbyL.J.ECabral,NotaryPublicmarkedasP1.TheAppellants in their written submissions contended that RanamukaDevage John Fernando was entitled and/or possessed the saiddivided portion of 32.8 perches which was corroborated by the planmarked V1. The Appellants contended that Ranamuka DevageJohn Fernando kept on developing the said land and acquired theprescriptivetitlealso.Thereafter,RanamukaDevageJohnFernando gifted the land to Agampodi Justin Soyza via Deed of GiftNo.1151 dated 24.06.1947 attested by S. Wickramasinghe, NotaryPublic subject to life interest marked as P2. Following the death ofRanamuka Devage John Fernando, Agampodi Justin Soyza becamethe sole owner of the subject matter.

Agampodi Justin Soyza thereafter gifted the subject matter to the1st Plaintiff under Deed of Gift No.318 dated 27.02.1962 attestedby H. Milroy Fonseka Notary Public marked as P3 at trial. The 1stAppellant gifted an undivided 22 perches from the corpus to the2nd Appellant, her sister excluding two houses thereon under theDeedofGiftNo.294dated26.10.1998attestedbyLaxmanAmarasinghe, Notary Public marked as P4 at trial.

The Appellants further stated that having possessed the land indisputeuninterruptedlyandagainstallothersforaperiodexceeding 10 years, Plaintiffsand their Predecessor in title haveacquired the prescriptive title also in the land.

5

It was the Appellant's contention that they became the owners ofthe corpus by way of the abovementioned deed and that theRespondents started possession of the same illegally and forciblyfrom the latter part of the year 1992.

The Honorable Justice of the Court of Appeal held that as per thedeed P1 that has been led at the trial one John Fernando onlybecameentitledtoashareof3/10of the subject matter.Thereafter he has transferred the rights he purchased from deedP1 as well as the rights inherited to Agampodi Justin Soysa bydeed marked P2 however no proof has been led regarding therights that have been inherited which led to the ownership of theentire land portion.

It is settled law that when a declaration of title is sought through arei vindicatio action the onus is on the plaintiff to prove his title.This has been reiterated in many judgements including in the caseof De Silva vs. Goonetilleke [1960] 32 NLR 217 at p.219, a FullBench stated that in a rei vindicatio Action, The authorities unite inholding that plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute andthat if he cannot, the action will not lie. More recently, JusticeMahindaSamayawardhenainBallantudaAchchigeDonWasanthavMorawakagePremawathieandOthers[SC/Appeal/176/2014] decided on 17.05.2021 held that H.N.G.Fernando J. (later C.J.) in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR169 at 171 required strict proof of the Plaintiffs title. But this shallnot be understood that a Plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall provehis title beyond reasonable doubt such as in a criminal prosecution,or on a high degree of proof as in a partition action. The standard ofproof of title is on a balance of probabilities as in any other civil suit.The stringent proof of chain of title, which is the norm in a partitionaction to prove the pedigree, is not required in a rei vindicatio action.

In Wanigarathne Vs Juwanis Appuhamy [1962] 65 NLR 167Justice Herat observed: In an action rei vindicatio the plaintiff mustprove and 4 establish his title. He cannot ask for a declaration of

6

title in his favour merely on the strength that the defendant's title ispoor or not established.

The other important principle would be as set out in KarunadasaVs. Abdul Hameed [1958] 60 NLR 352 per Sansoni J In a reivindication action it is highly dangerous to adjudicate on an issue ofprescription without first going into and examining the documentarytitle of the parties.

Thus, the Appellants are required to prove their title on a balanceof probabilities. The Honourable Justices of the Court of Appealheld that the Appellants had failed to lead evidence and prove howthe said John Fernando became entitled to the entire corpus andfurther stated that the Appellants had come to court on the basisthat they were the owners of the land described in the schedule ofthe plaint.

It is the position of the Respondents that the Appellants have failedto prove title to the undivided portion of land as described in theschedule of P2.

It was the contention of the Respondents that the Appellants hadintended to get a declaration in a rei vindicatio action as a coowner, they should have referred to it in the plaint, of them beingco owners of the land in suit and they should have produced thepartition plan no 14/1932 along with an amicable partition deed inorder to prove the subject matter of the action being a co ownedlanddividingamongthefivebrothersandsistersofJohnFernando.

The Respondents further stated that the deed marked P2 does notdisclosefromwhereJohnFernandoclaimstherestoftheundivided share of 7/10th share in the land in suit and not an iotaof evidence is on record to establish title to the remaining saidshare and whatever that is referred in deed P2 where the Vendee oftheAppellantshavenotderivedanytitletotheremainingundivided 7/10th share of the said land.

7

Therefore, in order to answer the first question of law, it must beconsidered whether a presumption of title existed on part of theAppellants owing to the Appellants enjoying peaceful possessionprior to being ousted by the Respondents. As discussed above inorder for a presumption of title to exist the Appellants wheninitiating a rei vindicatio action must prove their title. However inthis case based on the deeds which have been led in evidenceduring the trial, the Appellants failed to prove the title to the entireland on which this action was initiated.

As correctly stated in the written submissions of the Respondentsin order to seek a declaration of title for the entire land as per limb(1) of the prayer to the plaint the Appellants must prove their titleto the whole land.

In the case of Leisa and Another v Simon and Another [2002] 1Sri L.R it was held that The moment title is proved the right topossess it is presumed.

In the case of Mudalihamy V. Appuhamy [1891] 1 CLR 67,Burnside C.J observed that The Plaintiff was in the bonafidepossession of the chena in question and had cleared it for sowingwhen the Defendant entered upon it sowed it and put the Plaintiffout. Now Prima facie, the Plaintiffhaving been in possession, hewas entitled to keep it against all the world but the rightful owner,and if the Defendant claimed to be the owner, the burden of provinghis title rested on him, and Plaintiff might have contended himselfwith proving his de facie possession at the time of the ouster ... "

Therefore in light of the above, if the title had been proved by theAppellants, then the right to possess is presumed. However, in thiscase the Appellants have failed to establish title to the entirety ofthe land.

I will now proceed to answer the second question of law, namelyHave the Court of Appeal and the District Court erred in notconsidering that in an action for declaration of title, the Court has

8

the jurisdiction to declare the undivided share of the Plaintiffs andeject a trespasser from the land in dispute even though the actionhas been brought on the basis that the Plaintiff are the owners ofthe land in dispute?

The important question is whether one co owner maintain apossessory action against the other co owner? The general principlewhichmilitatesagainstthecompetenceofonecoownertomaintain a possessory action against the other co owners, derivesfrom the consideration that each co owner, in the absence of anamicable partition or other informal arrangement, is entitled topossession of every part of the common property, so that theexclusion of a co owner from any portion of the common property isusually not warranted.

Upon perusal of the plaint of the Appellants that nowhere in theaverments of the plaint have the Appellants referred to themselvesas being co- owners of the land in suit in claiming title to undividedshare of the said land. The instant action of the Appellants in factwas not initiated on a declaration of title to an undivided share ofland in suit and ejectment of a trespasser from the whole land insuit.

As such it appears that the question of law mentioned above hasbeen put forth in appeal for the first time and not in accord withthe case presented by the Appellants in the District Court. It is theaccepted standard as per the procedural law in Sri Lanka that aparty to an action cannot put forward a ground of appeal for thefirst time in appeal unless it might have been put forward in theCourt below and in other hand the matter in question should be onwhich deals with the pure question of law.

This position has been reiterated in the case of Gunawardena Vs.Deraniyagala [2010] 1 SRL 309 where Justice BandaranayakeC.J.observed that that according to our procedure a new groundcannot be considered for the first time in appeal, if the said point has

9

not been raised at the trial under the issues so framed. Accordinglythe Appellate Court could consider a point raised for the first time inappeal, if the following requirements are fulfilled.

a. the question raised for the first time in appeal, is a pure questionof law and is not a mixed question of law and fact;

b. the question raised for the first time in appeal is an issue putforward in the Court below under one of the issues raised; and

c. the Court which hears the appeal has before it all the material thatis required to decide the question.

Inthecase of Talagala v Gangodawila Co-operative StoresSociety Ltd [1947] 48 N.L.R. 472 Dias J held that it had clearlystated that as a general rule it is not open to a party to put forwardfor the first time in appeal a new ground unless it might have beenput forward in the trial Court under one of the issues framed and theCourt hearing the appeal has before it all the requisite material fordeciding the question.

As per explanation 2 of Section 150 of the Civil Procedure CodeOrdinance No. 02 0f 1889 as amended, a party is not entitled tomake out a case for the first time in appeal different from

(a)The case already presented before trial court,(b)The case in which they have placed on record.(c)The case in which the trial has commenced.

In light of the above procedure and case law along with evidenceled at trial, it is abundantly clear that the Appellants have failed toprove and establish title to the whole land and was not entitled tothe relief prayed for in limb 1 of the prayer of the plaint and assuch is not entitled in law to make a case materially different fromthat which they have placed on record and presented before theTrial Judge.

Therefore, considering all of the above factors in this appeal of thePlaintiffs Appellants Appellants, I am of the view that the Learned

10

District Court Judge and the Honourable Justice of the Court ofAppeal had arrived at a correct conclusion that the PlaintiffsAppellants Appellants had failed to prove title to the entirety of theproperty described in the schedule of the plaint.

Accordingly, I answer the 1st and 2nd questions of law on whichspecial leave to appeal has been granted in the negative. For thesereasons, the Judgment of the Court of Appeal and that of theDistrict Court of Colombo are affirmed. The Appeal of the PlaintiffsAppellants Appellants is hereby dismissed.
