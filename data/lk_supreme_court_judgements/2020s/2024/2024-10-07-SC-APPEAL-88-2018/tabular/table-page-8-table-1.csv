"Therefore,
in order
to answer the first question of
law,
it must be"
"considered whether a presumption of
title
existed on part of
the"
"Appellants
owing
to
the Appellants
enjoying peaceful possession"
"prior
to being ousted by the Respondents. As discussed above in"
"order
for
a
presumption
of
title
to
exist
the
Appellants when"
"initiating a rei vindicatio action must prove their title. However in"
"this
case
based on the deeds which have been led in evidence"
"during the trial, the Appellants failed to prove the title to the entire"
"land on which this action was initiated."
"As correctly stated in the written submissions of
the Respondents"
"in order to seek a declaration of title for the entire land as per limb"

"and if
the Defendant claimed to be the
owner, the burden of proving"
"his title rested on him, and Plaintiff might

"Therefore in light of
the above,
