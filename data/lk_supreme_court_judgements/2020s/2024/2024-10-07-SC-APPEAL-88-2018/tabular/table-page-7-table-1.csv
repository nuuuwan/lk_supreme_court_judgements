"title in his favour merely on the strength that
the defendant's title is"
"poor or not established.”"
"The other important principle would be as set out
in Karunadasa"
"Vs. Abdul Hameed [1958] 60 NLR 352 per Sansoni J “In a rei"
"vindication action it
is highly dangerous to adjudicate on an issue of"
"prescription without
first going into and examining the documentary"
"title of the parties”."
"Thus,
the Appellants are required to prove their title on a balance"
"of probabilities. The Honourable Justices of
the Court of Appeal"
"held that the Appellants had failed to lead evidence and prove how"
"the said John Fernando became entitled to the entire corpus and"
"further stated that
the Appellants had come to court on the basis"
"that
they were the owners of the land described in the schedule of"
"the plaint."
"It is the position of the Respondents that the Appellants have failed"
"to prove title to the undivided portion of
land as described in the"
"schedule of P2."
"It was the contention of
the Respondents that
the Appellants had"
"intended
to
get
a declaration in a
rei
vindicatio
action as
a
co"
"owner,
they should have referred to it
in the plaint, of them being"
"co owners of
the land in suit and they should have produced the"
"partition plan no 14/1932 along with an amicable partition deed in"
"order
to prove the subject matter of
the action being a co owned"
"land
dividing
among
the
five
brothers
and
sisters
of
John"
"Fernando."
"The Respondents further stated that the deed marked P2 does not"
"disclose
from where
John
Fernando
claims
the
rest
of
the"
"undivided share of 7/10th share in the land in suit and not an iota"
"of
evidence
is
on record to
establish title
to the
remaining said"
"share and whatever that is referred in deed P2 where the Vendee of"
"the
Appellants
have
not
derived
any
title
to
the
remaining"
"undivided 7/10th share of the said land."
