"eject a trespasser from the land in dispute even though the action"
"has been brought on the basis that
the Plaintiff are the owners of"
"the land in dispute?”"
"The
important
question
is whether
one
co
owner maintain
a"
"possessory action against the other co owner? The general principle"
"which militates
against
the
competence
of
one
co
owner
to"
"maintain a possessory action against
the other co owners, derives"
"from the

each co owner,
in the absence of an"

time in appeal unless it might have been put
forward in the"

"which deals with the pure question of law."
"This position has been reiterated in the case of Gunawardena Vs."
"Deraniyagala
