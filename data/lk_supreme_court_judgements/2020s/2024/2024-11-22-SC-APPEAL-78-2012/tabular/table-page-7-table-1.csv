"Thus, A. K. Peter Singho had transferred his interest in the land both to the 1st Plaintiff"
"and the 2nd Plaintiff by the deeds produced, marked P5 and P4 in the trial. Therefore,"
"the 2nd Plaintiff is entitled to 80 perches and the 1st Plaintiff is entitled to 06 perches"
"with the house, by virtue of these deeds. The learned District Judge having considered"
"that A. K. Peter Singho could only have lawfully transferred the shares he had been"
"allotted by the Judgment of the previous Partition Action, had nevertheless proceeded"
"to hold that A. K. Peter Singho was entitled to transfer the above extents of land on"
"the basis that he had acquired Prescriptive Title to the excess part of the land."
