COUNSEL : Uditha Egalahewa, PC with Chathura Chamupathi for the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants.

K. V. Sirisena for the 1st Defendant-Appellant-Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 13-03-2024

DECIDED ON : 22-11-2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st and 2nd

Plaintiffs) instituted action in the District Court of Matugama against the Defendant-

Appellant-Respondent and the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st and 2nd Defendants, respectively) seeking a partition

decree in respect of the land more fully described in the Schedule to the Plaint. This

is the land depicted as Lot 2 in Plan No. 2300 dated 14-10-1969, prepared by Peter

G. Dias Licensed Surveyor.

Pursuant to the further steps being taken, the Court Commissioner Y. P. de Silva

Licensed Surveyor has submitted to Court, the Preliminary Plan (Plan No. 444)

prepared on 06th and 12th December 1992. This Plan has been produced, marked X.

At the inception, all parties have admitted that the corpus relevant to this action is the

land depicted in Plan No. 444, prepared on the 06th and 12th December 1992, by Y. P.

de Silva, Licensed Surveyor.

After conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Matugama by his Judgment

dated 07-02-2003, ordered the partition of the corpus relevant to the action allotting

shares in the following way.

[SC Appeal 78/2012] - Page 5 of 10

1st Plaintiff 1460/8498

2nd Plaintiff 5022/8498 (Less 20 Perches)

1st Defendant 2016/8498

2nd Defendant 20 Perches

Being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 07-02-2003, pronounced by the District Court,

the 1st Defendant appealed to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals on the ground

that the learned District Judge had erred in law as he had failed to consider the

evidence led on behalf of the 1st Defendant in respect of certain improvements said to

have been effected by the 1st Defendant to the building marked A in Plan No. 444.

The 1st Defendant in the said appeal had claimed the premises of the building marked

A in Plan No. 444.

The Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals holden in Kalutara, after conclusion of the

argument of the said appeal, by its Judgment dated 24-03-2011, had decided the said

appeal in favour of the 1st Defendant.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 24-03-2011 pronounced by the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals, the Plaintiff has filed the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant

to this Appeal. Upon the said Leave to Appeal Petition being supported, this Court by

its order, dated 29-03-2012, had granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the questions

of law set out in paragraphs 24(a), 24(b), 24(c) , 24(d), 24(e) and 24(f) of the Petition,

dated 13-07-2011.

However, in the course of the hearing, the learned Counsel for both parties agreed

that the primary issue to be decided in this Appeal by this Court is only the issue set

out in question of law set out in paragraph 23(b) of the Petition and therefore, it would

not be necessary for the Court to consider the other questions of law. Let me therefore

at the outset, reproduce the question of law set out in paragraph 23(b) which is as

follows:

[SC Appeal 78/2012] - Page 6 of 10

6

23. (b). Did the Hon. Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals err in

law by holding that the 1st Defendant was entitled to the building marked A

in the plan marked X.

There is no dispute that in a previous Partition Action bearing No. P 2507 in the District

Court of Kalutara, the Plaintiffs father, A. K. Peter Singho, 1st Defendant Amugoda

Kankanamge Kusumawathi were parties who had been allotted shares from the

Judgment of the said Partition Action. The 1st Plaintiff, the 2nd Plaintiff and the 2nd

Defendant are sons of said A. K. Peter Singho, while the 1st Defendant is a daughter

of said A. K. Peter Singho.

The plan bearing No. 2300 filed in the case No. P/2507 in the District Court of Kalutara

has been produced, marked P 1, in the trial in the instant case. The Final Decree in

Kalutara District Court case No. P/2507 has been produced, marked P 2, in the trial.

It could be seen accordingly that Lot No. 2 in the Plan No. 2300 (P 1) by virtue of the

Final Decree in Kalutara District Court Case No. P/2507 has been allotted to the father

of the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff, 1st and 2nd Defendants, namely A. K. Peter Singho.

Although there are many other parties to whom shares have been allotted by virtue

of the Judgment of the District Court Kalutara Case No. P/2507, the father of the

Plaintiff has acquired the Prescriptive Title by long term adverse and uninterrupted

possession of those several lots.

In keeping with the title that the father, A. K. Peter Singho, had acquired, said Peter

Singho, by Deed of Gift No. 861 produced in the trial, marked P4, attested on 26-06-

1990 by Somasiri Iddagoda, Notary Public, had gifted to the 2nd Plaintiff an undivided

portion of 80 perches from this land. Said Peter Singho, by Deed of Gift No. 395

produced in the trial, marked P5, attested by Don David Munasinghe, Notary Public,

had gifted to the 1st Plaintiff an undivided portion of 06 perches from this land on

which the house is situated.

[SC Appeal 78/2012] - Page 7 of 10

7

Thus, A. K. Peter Singho had transferred his interest in the land both to the 1st Plaintiff

and the 2nd Plaintiff by the deeds produced, marked P5 and P4 in the trial. Therefore,

the 2nd Plaintiff is entitled to 80 perches and the 1st Plaintiff is entitled to 06 perches

with the house, by virtue of these deeds. The learned District Judge having considered

that A. K. Peter Singho could only have lawfully transferred the shares he had been

allotted by the Judgment of the previous Partition Action, had nevertheless proceeded

to hold that A. K. Peter Singho was entitled to transfer the above extents of land on

the basis that he had acquired Prescriptive Title to the excess part of the land.

The 1st Defendant, after her marriage in 1991, had left the house to live with her

husband elsewhere. However, she appears to have returned to this house in 1993 or

1994. The 1st Defendant claims that she made certain improvements thereafter to the

part of the house that she had occupied since the time of her return.

The 1st Defendant in her evidence had taken up the position that she had spent about

25,000 Rupees at that time to make the improvements she claims to have made to

the part of the house she claims. However, admittedly in her evidence she has

disclosed that she was one time employed as a mid-wife who was only paid 62 Rupees

and 50 Cents at the beginning and thereafter worked under a doctor for a salary of

Rupees 135. She had worked as a mid-wife from 1969 to 1970 although she has

stated that she resigned from that job in the year 1969. Having considered the

evidence adduced by the 1st Defendant, the learned District Judge had rightly come

to the conclusion that she is not a truthful witness. It was on that basis that the

learned District Judge had opted not to act on the evidence of the 1st Defendant with

regard to her claim for a part of the house depicted in the plan.

Let me next refer to the evidence of the Court Commissioner, Y. P. De Silva Licensed

surveyor. The Court Commissioner has clearly stated in his evidence that the building

depicted in Plan P 1, which is the plan produced in the previous Partition Action

(Kalutara District Court Case No. P/2507), is the same building depicted in the Plan

No. 444 prepared by him, produced, marked X ,in this case.

[SC Appeal 78/2012] - Page 8 of 10

The confusion appears to have arisen because the Court Commissioner had given two

markings A and B to the respective portions, the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant

have claimed. Although the 1st Defendant had attempted to show that the respective

portions marked A and B are two distinct portions, the learned District Judge, had

rightly concluded that it is one house with a common roof and a common front

entrance. Although the 1st Defendant had stated in her evidence that she spent 25,000

Rupees to make improvements to the part she was living in, she has failed to produce

any document in that regard to substantiate that position. Even the Court

Commissioner does not support the claim by the 1st Defendant that she made a roof

with zinc sheets as the Court Commissioner had not observed such a change in the

roof.

Although the 1st Defendant had claimed the portion of the building marked A in the

Plan X, I see no basis to allow such a claim. While the 1st Plaintiff had claimed the

whole building (both portions marked A and B), there is no basis to reject that claim

as the 1st Plaintiff has been successful in establishing his title to that portion of the

land including the whole building.

The 1st Defendant had relied on Deed No. 513, attested on 08-02-1993 by Nithya

Kumari Goonetileke, Notary Public. The 1st Defendant had marked this Deed as 1 1.

This is a deed which had only transferred contingent rights after the institution of the

instant Partition Action. The learned District Judge had rightly concluded that said

Amugoda Kankanamlage Don Gunasena is not entitled to any claim in the corpus.

Since said Amugoda Kankanamlage Don Gunasena is not entitled to any interest in

the corpus, it necessarily follows that the 1st Defendant also does not get any

entitlement through Deed No. 513 (1 1).

Furthermore, the Court commissioner in his evidence has categorically stated that the

building containing the portions marked A and B is just one building; there is no

separation between the portion marked A and the portion marked B and it is the

same building depicted in the plan P 1, prepared on 14-10-1969.

[SC Appeal 78/2012] - Page 9 of 10

The evidence of the Court Commissioner particularly relating to the answers he had

provided in the course of the Cross examination is worth being reproduced here. It

would be self-explanatory and resolve the issue whether the portions marked A and

B are two distinct portions or one and the same building.

On perusal of the Judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals,

Judgment dated 24-03-2011, reveals clearly that the learned Judges of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals had opted to ignore the material that the learned District

Judge had taken into consideration in order to come to the conclusion that the 1st

Defendant is not a truthful witness. The learned Judges of the Provincial High Courts

of Civil Appeals in their Judgment had barely placed full reliance on some parts of the

oral evidence of the 1st Defendant without considering the aspect of the credibility of

her evidence. In my view, the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals had erred in that regard.

Having regard to the evidence led in this case I decide to answer the question of law

set out in paragraph 23(b) of the Petition, dated 13-07-2011, in the affirmative. For

the foregoing reasons I set aside the Judgment, dated 24-03-2011, pronounced by

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. I restore the Judgment dated 07-02-2003

pronounced by the learned District Judge.

Appeal is allowed. I order no costs.
