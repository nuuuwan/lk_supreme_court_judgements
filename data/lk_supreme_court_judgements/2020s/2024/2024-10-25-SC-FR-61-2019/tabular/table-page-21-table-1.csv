"Handbook for 2017/2018 which contains the ‘Z’ score for 2016/2017 and it appears that"
"the Petitioner’s version may be correct. Thus, although the conduct of the Petitioner was"
"fraudulent, it may not have made any difference in the final assessment."
"T
he  second 
is  the  submission  of  the 
learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  that  the"
"requirement to tender the school leaving certificate is mandatory and since P2 contains"
"false  information,  the  requirement  for  the  Petitioner  to  certify  that  the  information"
"contained in his application is true can never be satisfied. This argument is the other side"
"of  the  submission  that  disqualification 
is  permanent.  While  on  the  face  of 
it,  this"
"submission  is  factually  correct,  I  am  not  inclined  to  agree  with  the  learned  Additional"
"Solicitor General for two reasons. The first reason is that the Petitioner has been punished"
"once  for  the  said  infringement  and  to  continue  to  punish  him  in  terms  of  the  First"
"Handbook would be unreasonable and unfair. The second reason is that in any event, as"
"set out in Section 1.5 of the First Handbook, the requirement for an applicant to tender"
"his school leaving certificate is to determine the district of such applicant for university"
"admission  and  to be  satisfied that  the  applicant  has in  fact  attended such  school. This"
"would  be  in  respect  of  an  applicant  who  has  attended  a  school  in  order  to  follow  the"
"programme of study leading up to the Advanced Level examination."
"H
owever, when the Petitioner sat the Advanced Level examination in 2018, he did so, not"
"as a school candidate but as a private candidate. Section 1.5 states further that where"
"“the candidate has not enrolled in any school for advanced level during that period, the"
"district where the permanent place of residence of the candidate is located is the district"
"considered for university admission”. The reference to ‘during that period’ is to the three"
"year  period  preceding  the  Advanced  Level  examination  held 
in  August  2018.  Thus,"
"although  the  school 
leaving  certificate  must  still  be  submitted,  the  district  of  the"
"Petitioner will be determined on the basis of his residence which shall be confirmed by a"
"certificate of the Grama Niladhari countersigned by the Divisional Secretary, and not on"
"the school leaving certificate."
"T
he third matter that I wish to advert to is the judgment of this Court in Nafees v Kiriella,"
"Minister of Higher Education and Others [SC (FR) Application No. 56/2018; SC Minutes"
"of  29th  September  2022]  cited  by 
the 
learned  Additional  Solicitor  General.  That"
"21"
