"Restrictions on the change of district"
"O
f course, if shifting from one district to another is easy and hassle free, one would expect"
"many students to make this shift and gain an unfair advantage thus distorting the steps"
"taken by the State in levelling the playing field. In order to prevent the system from being"
"abused and prevent a student who has his or her permanent residence within a district"
"which requires a higher ‘Z’ score and who has completed his or her education until the"
"Ordinary Level examination in a school situated within such district from crossing over to"
"a school situated in an educationally disadvantaged district, the Ministry of Education has"
"issued circulars stipulating the criteria that must be satisfied in order for a student to gain"
"admission to the Advanced Level stream of a school situated in a district that is different"
"from  the  district  from  which  that  student  had  sat  for  the  Ordinary  Level  examination."
"Thus, a student studying in a school situated in a district which has not been classified as"
"an educationally disadvantaged district for purposes of university admission will not be"
"permitted to seek admission to a school situated in a district classified as an educationally"
"disadvantaged district, unless the exceptional situations identified in such circulars apply"
