"Commission,  the  fraudulent  manner  of  registering  students  at  the  Kahatagasdigiliya"
"Madya  Maha  Vidyalaya  had  caught  the  attention  of  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The"
"investigation  that  followed  had  revealed  that  while  more  than  80  students  had  been"
"registered  contrary  to  the  circular  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  that  false"
"entries had been made by the then Principal to effect such registrations, 28 students had"
"qualified for university admission from that school. Incidentally, during such investigation,"
"and prior to the Petitioner submitting his application seeking admission to university,  the"
"statement  of  the  Petitioner  too  had  been  recorded.  Thus,  by  the  time  the  Petitioner"
"submitted his application for admission, the Petitioner was aware that his actions were"
"under review."
