"H
as the Petitioner come to Court with clean hands?"
"I
 must at this stage consider the preliminary objection raised by the learned Additional"
"Solicitor General that this application is liable to be dismissed in limine for the reason that"
"the Petitioner has not come to Court with clean hands. The basis for this objection was"
"that  the  Petitioner  has  tendered  with  the  petition  the  school  leaving  certificate  P2  in"
"support of his case before this Court, knowing fully well that P2 is a false document and"
"that the Petitioner has thereby tried to mislead Court into accepting P2."
