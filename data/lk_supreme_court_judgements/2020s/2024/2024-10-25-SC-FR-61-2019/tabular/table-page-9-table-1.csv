"It  is  admitted  that  the  Petitioner  did  not  respond  to  the  above  letter  and  that  the"
"University Grants Commission proceeded to disqualify the Petitioner from being admitted"
"to a State university for the academic year 2016 – 2017, even though there was no further"
"intimation  in  this  regard  by  the  University  Grants  Commission.  As  borne  out  by  the"
"explanation contained in his aforementioned  letter P9, the Petitioner was aware of what"
"he  was  getting  into,  and  he  must  take  full  responsibility  for  his  actions  and  face  the"
"consequences. To my mind, the decision of the University Grants Commission to reject"
"the application of the Petitioner for the academic year 2016 – 2017 is completely in order."
"The said decision however is not the subject of review in this application, but only gives"
"context to the issue that must be considered in this application."
