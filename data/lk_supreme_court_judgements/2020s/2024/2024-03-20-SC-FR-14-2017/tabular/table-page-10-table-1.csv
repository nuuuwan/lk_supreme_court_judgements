"Government. However, the Court has to be cautious to ensure that the application"
"of the guarantee of equality does not finally produce iniquitous consequences. A"
"useful safeguard in this respect would be the application of a basic standard or"
"its elements, wherever applicable. The principal element in the basic standard as"
"stated  above  is  reasonableness  as  opposed  to  being  arbitrary.  In  respect  of"
"legislation where the question would be looked more in the abstract, one would"
"look at the class of persons affected by the law in relation to those left out. In"
"respect of executive or administrative action one would look at the person who is"
"alleging  the  infringement  and  the  extent  to  which  such  person  is  affected  or"
"would be affected. But, the test once again is one of being reasonable and not"
"arbitrary."
