"T
he  above  Rules  demonstrate  the  duty  cast  on  the  Appointing  Authority  to  make"
"timely  appointments  and  promotions.  The  public  servants  of  this  Country  render"
"yeoman service to the Public notwithstanding the fact that their remuneration may"
"not  be  commensurate  with  the  services  they  perform.  What  motivates  them  to"
"continue to work for the State is the great pride one derives in being a public servant"
"and the rewards for such service by way of periodic promotions that they are entitled"
"to in terms of the relevant service minute. It would not be an exaggeration to say that"
"all public servants look forward to receiving promotions that they are entitled to in a"
"timely manner. It is therefore the paramount duty of the Inspector General of Police,"
"with a view to keeping his staff motivated, to ensure that steps are taken to fill the"
"vacancies that arise in accordance with the duly established Rules."
