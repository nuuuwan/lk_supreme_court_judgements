"this Court, has stated that:"
"“
It [the Court] has conceptualised the holders of public power as trustees: public"
"institutions  and  personalities  hold  power  in  trust  to  be  used  solely  for  public"
"benefit. That power is never unfettered or absolute. That power must be exercised"
"fairly. This  means that, at least, public decision-making should be transparent,"
"reasonable and fair. It cannot be exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner."
"It  has  also  come  to  mean  that  government  should  be  conducted  within  a"
"framework of recognized rules and principles.” [at page 586]"
"“Discretionary powers given to public institutions are never untrammeled. They"
"are to be used to achieve the purpose for which they were conferred. Arbitrary"
"and unreasonable decisions are the antithesis of fair play and equal treatment."
"They violate the 'trust' placed in public officials.” [at page 592]"
