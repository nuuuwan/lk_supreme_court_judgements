"E
ven though the National Police Commission has a discretion in deciding to deviate"
"from  the  procedure  laid  down  in  the  Procedural  Rules,  such  discretion  must  be"
"exercised reasonably. As held in the Order of this Court read out by Chief Justice G.P.S."
"De Silva in Premachandra v Jayawickreme and Another [(1994) 2 Sri LR 90], “There"
"are no absolute or unfettered discretions in  public law; discretions are conferred  on"
"public  functionaries  in  trust  for  the  public,  to  be  used  for  the  public  good,  and  the"
"propriety of the exercise of such discretions is to be judged by reference to the purposes"
"for which they were so entrusted.”"
