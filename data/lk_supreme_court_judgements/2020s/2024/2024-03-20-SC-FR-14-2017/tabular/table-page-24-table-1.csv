"any  reasons  for  the  said  recommendation  nor  has  the  Inspector  General  of  Police"
"thought it fit to offer an explanation to this Court. Such an explanation was necessary"
"not only in view of the admitted failure to follow the Procedural Rules but also since"
"the  Department  of  Management  Services  had  also  created  twelve  vacancies  in  the"
"rank of Superintendent of Police, with the consequence that the number of vacancies"
"in the rank of ASP amounted to eighteen."
