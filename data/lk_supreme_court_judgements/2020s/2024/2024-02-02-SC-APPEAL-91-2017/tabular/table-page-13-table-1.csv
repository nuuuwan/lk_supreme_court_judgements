"In fact, the witness, a Cabin Manager, summoned on behalf of the Respondent testified"
"that a lot of complaints on sexual harassment had been received during his service period."
"He  stated  that  a  lot  of  complaints  were  received  against  the  Respondent  on  sexual"
"harassment [Appeal Brief page 691]."
"Moreover, the bad record of the Respondent was clearly  manifest in the evidence. The"
"Respondent had been warned repeatedly, punished and grounded on several occasions"
"due  to  misconduct 
including  neglect  of  duties, 
leave  without  notice  and  excessive"
"absenteeism. His probationary period had been extended due to his poor performance,"
"he had to re-sit all exams as he could not meet the standards when tested and on a second"
"appraisal he was found wanting."
"The  Respondent  also  constantly  took  no  pay  leave,  was  warned  for  reporting  late  for"
"flights  and  did  not  follow  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Appellant.  He  was  even"
"transferred to the airport service department (grounded) due to misconduct."
"For the foregoing reasons, I answer the two questions of law in the affirmative."
"The learned President of the Tribunal erred in holding otherwise. So did the High Court in"
"affirming the order of the Tribunal."
"Accordingly, 
I  set  aside  both  the 
judgment  of  the  High  Court  of  Negombo  dated"
"19.10.2016 and order of the Tribunal dated 22.10.2013."
"I hold that the termination of the services of the Respondent is just and equitable."
