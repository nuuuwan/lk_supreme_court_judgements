"Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that the termination of his services was not just and"
"equitable.  It  was  so  held  as  the  Appellant  had  allegedly  treated  other  employees  who"
"were similarly situated to the Respondent differently without terminating their services."
"However, as the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted, the other instances relied"
"on  by  the  Respondent  cannot  be  put  on  equal  footing  with  the  misdemeanor  of  the"
"Appellant."
"One such instance was where another flying stewardess, who is referred to as Y for the"
"purposes of this judgment, who was on the same flight had complained of having been"
"harassed by another flying steward. However, evidence was led to establish that although"
"Y had also initially complained to the Purser, she had later refused to make any written"
"complaint of the incident. She had indicated that she is capable of handling herself and"
"does  not  wish  to  pursue  with  a  complaint.  The  Appellant  cannot  be  expected  to  take"
"further steps in the absence of a complaint from the aggrieved party."
"In this case, X made a written complaint that was marked as R1 at the inquiry without any"
"objection. In fact, the Respondent identified it as having been signed by X. No doubt, X"
"did not testify before the Tribunal. However, the Appellant explained the absence. X had"
"by then resigned from service.  The complaint R1 had the  full details of the incident as"
"narrated  by  X.  Although  the  Appellant  gave  an  undertaking  sometime  after  R1  was"
"marked,  that  X  would  be  summoned  as  a  witness,  that  cannot  negate  the  evidentiary"
"value of the contents of R1 which was marked without subject to proof. Moreover, R1 was"
"shown to the Respondent during cross-examination and he admitted that it was given by"
"X."
