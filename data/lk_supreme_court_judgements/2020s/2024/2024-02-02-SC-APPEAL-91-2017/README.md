The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) was employed as a Ground/cum

Flight Steward with the Respondent-Appellant-Appellant (Appellant) from 21.09.1992.

On 17.03.2005 whilst operating as the Senior Flight Steward in UL 505 CMB/LON flight,

the Respondent was accused of sexually harassing a Flight Stewardess, who for the

purposes of this appeal shall be referred to as X. The factual circumstances constituting

sexual harassment by the Respondent as alleged by X is set out in the charge sheet as

follows:

i. The Respondent did hold X from her midriff and did kiss her on the cheek

on two occasions.

ii. The Respondent did grab her by the buttocks in the galley as well as in the

cabin on several occasions.

iii. The Respondent did stick his tongue out and lick his lips in an insinuating

manner several times.

iv. By acting in the manner referred to in i, ii, and iii above, the Respondent

did tarnish the image of the Appellant and caused the Appellant to lose

confidence in the Respondent.

The Respondent was found guilty of the charges at a disciplinary inquiry conducted on

07.09.2005. His services were thereafter terminated.

The Respondent filed an application at the Labour Tribunal (Tribunal) on 28.11.2005,

seeking reinstatement with back wages.

Page 4 of 14

The Chief Steward (Purser) of the flight, In-Flight Services Delivery Manager and

Production Development Manager of the Appellant testified on behalf of the Appellant.

The Respondent testified on his behalf and summoned another Cabin Manager to testify.

After the inquiry, the Tribunal held that the termination of services of the Respondent was

not just and equitable. The Tribunal ordered reinstatement without back wages subject to

one year of probation on the premise that being without work for a period of 8 years, is

sufficient punishment as there had been other employees who had received lesser

punishment for similar misconduct. The Tribunal order is dated 22.10.2013.

The Appellant appealed to the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Negombo which was dismissed.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

a. Whether the relief awarded to the applicant by the Provincial High Court and the

Labour Tribunal is just and equitable and/or consistent with the principles of law,

considering the facts and circumstances of the case?

b. Whether the Provincial High Court and the Labour tribunal erred in law in the

analysis of the evidence and reached findings that are unsupported by evidence

and/or perverse?

Let me address these two questions by reference to the following extract from the order

of the Tribunal:

. (emphasis added)

The Tribunal holds that the Respondent has failed to explain why X had made a grave and

false complaint against him. Indeed, it is inconceivable why X, against whom the

Respondent made no allegations of malice or bad faith, would come forward to make such

a grave complaint without any foundation. It is certainly not a path that a women will

lightly take in our society without any basis due to the stigma it brings unless motivated

by mala fides.

The Tribunal further holds that the Respondent has failed to tender any evidence to

establish that the Purser of the flight had given false testimony against him. The Purser

testified that another flight stewardess had told him of the incident and he immediately

went and spoke to X to inquire about the incident. He found her in a state of distress

overcome with sadness and unable to explain the incident in detail. It was a natural state

of mind for a young flying stewardess who had to face such a situation after being in

service for just about a year. The Purser further testified that the Respondent appeared to

be intoxicated and that his breath smelled of cigarettes and alcohol. In terms of the

company policy of the Appellant, a crew member cannot consume alcohol within ten

hours of a scheduled flight. The Purser had made an entry of this incident in the Voyage

Report which was marked in evidence.

However, the Tribunal concluded that the Appellant had failed to establish, on a balance

of probability, the grave and disgusting sexual harassment charges against the

Respondent. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has concluded that the Respondent has, by his

physical and verbal actions, acted in a manner that disrupted the work of X and harmed

her personality.

In this context, we must examine what is meant by sexual harassment. It is a criminal

offence in terms of section 345 of the Penal Code which reads as follows:

Whoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses another person or

by the use of words or actions, causes sexual annoyance or harassment to such

other person commits the offence of sexual harassment (emphasis added)

Explanation 1 therein states that unwelcome sexual advances by words or action used by

a person in authority, to a working place or any other place, shall constitute the offence

of sexual harassment.

Given that sexual harassment is a criminal offence, such conduct amounts to a serious

misconduct at the workplace. I must hasten to add that sexual harassment can take place

against both men and women.

In Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. [AIR 1997 Supreme Court 3011], The Supreme

Court of India held that:

Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour

(whether directly or by implication) as:

a) physical contact and advances;

b) a demand or request for sexual favours;

c) sexually coloured remarks;

d) showing pornography;

e) any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.

Female sexuality includes issues pertaining to personality. Hence it is evident that the

conclusions of the Tribunal support a finding of sexual harassment of X by the physical and

verbal actions of the Respondent.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that the termination of his services was not just and

equitable. It was so held as the Appellant had allegedly treated other employees who

were similarly situated to the Respondent differently without terminating their services.

However, as the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted, the other instances relied

on by the Respondent cannot be put on equal footing with the misdemeanor of the

Appellant.

One such instance was where another flying stewardess, who is referred to as Y for the

purposes of this judgment, who was on the same flight had complained of having been

harassed by another flying steward. However, evidence was led to establish that although

Y had also initially complained to the Purser, she had later refused to make any written

complaint of the incident. She had indicated that she is capable of handling herself and

does not wish to pursue with a complaint. The Appellant cannot be expected to take

further steps in the absence of a complaint from the aggrieved party.

In this case, X made a written complaint that was marked as R1 at the inquiry without any

objection. In fact, the Respondent identified it as having been signed by X. No doubt, X

did not testify before the Tribunal. However, the Appellant explained the absence. X had

by then resigned from service. The complaint R1 had the full details of the incident as

narrated by X. Although the Appellant gave an undertaking sometime after R1 was

marked, that X would be summoned as a witness, that cannot negate the evidentiary

value of the contents of R1 which was marked without subject to proof. Moreover, R1 was

shown to the Respondent during cross-examination and he admitted that it was given by

X.

Another incident relied on by the Respondent is where another flying stewardess had

complained that a Purser had visited her room on a stopover in Bangkok and

propositioned her. The said Purser had apologized to the flying stewardess and had not

been assigned duties for over six months and had only short flights for a year. This incident

happened off duty and moreover, there was no written complaint made by the flying

stewardess.

In General Manager, Ceylon Electricity Board & Another v. Gunapala [(1991) 1 Sri.L.R.

304] the applicant was proved to have consumed liquor in contravention of the circular

while on duty. It was held that the fact that other employees who were found to have

consumed liquor were not similarly-dismissed from service is not relevant in deciding

whether the termination of the services of the Applicant was just and equitable.

Moreover, in Ceylon Transport Board v. Samastha Lanka Motor Sevaka Samithiya (65

NLR 566), a workman employed by the Ceylon Transport Board was dismissed because he

had broken a rule which provided that any employee who removed a vehicle belonging to

the Board, either without authority, or without a driving licence, would be dismissed. It

was held that the fact that, about a year later, the Board did not dismiss, but merely

transferred and warned, another employee for a similar offence was not proof of

discrimination against the workman in that case.

A similar approach has been taken by the Employment Appeals Tribunal of UK. In Kay v.

Cheadle Royal Healthcare Ltd. [Appeal No. UKEAT/0060/11/CEA, Decided on:

12.09.2011] it was held:

The Tribunal plainly thought that Ms. Thomas ought also to have been disciplined,

and it was critical of part of the reasoning given by the Respondent for not doing

so. But in the end, the true question was whether it was unfair to dismiss the

Claimant, applying of course the test under section 98(4) of the 1996 Act. The

Tribunal correctly asked itself this question and concluded that the inconsistent

Page 10 of 14

treatment was not such as to make the dismissal unfair. We see no error of law in

this conclusion. Indeed on the basis of the findings in the letter of dismissal while

the Respondent may be criticised for not disciplining Ms. Thomas it cannot in our

view be criticized for dismissing the Claimant. The findings in that letter plainly

merited dismissal.

The burden to be discharged by the Appellant then is to establish that the impugned

misconduct justifies the termination of the Respondent. As the learned counsel for the

Appellant correctly submitted, the question that the Tribunal should have asked is

whether the termination of the Respondent is just and equitable for such misconduct. If

the termination is just and equitable, it matters not that other employees have not been

punished.

However, if termination may not be the only punishment that could have been meted out,

then the fact that others who are similarly circumstanced have been given a different

punishment is a relevant factor.

Let me now consider the gravity of sexual harassment. In so far as sexual harassment in

general is concerned, I would like to quote with approval Gooneratne J. in Manohari

Pelaketiya v. H.M. Gunasekera, Secretary, Ministry of Education and Others [S.C. (F/R)

76/2012, S.C.M. 28.09.2016] where he observed (at page 13):

I observe that continuous abuse and sexual harassment over a period of time

would cause physical and mental damage to any human being. It is not possible for

a female to resist such abuses unless she is a strong personality who could react

and retort to such abuses and harassment and make the abuser to shamelessly

withdraw, being exposed to the public at large of his indecency. Continuous threats

and abuses could also make a person unwell both physically and mentally. My views

expressed on the aspect of abuses would be endorsed by any law abiding citizen,

and it should be so.

Page 11 of 14

I had occasion previously to pen down my views on sexual harassment at the workplace

in Brandix Apparel Solutions Limited v. Fernando [S.C. Appeal 60/2018, S.C.M.

05.05.2022], where I held that:

It should be noted that it is the duty of an employer to provide a safe and

supportive work environment for its employees. The productivity of the employee

and the company will not increase unless such an environment exists. Sexual

harassment in any form should be dealt with severely because it will otherwise

pollute the working environment and affect employee morale.

It is important to observe that Article 11(1) of the Convention on the Elimination of All

Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which Sri Lanka has signed and ratified

without any reservation, requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures to

eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment in order to ensure, on

basis of equality of men and women, the same rights including the right to protection of

health and to safety in working conditions, including the safeguarding of the function of

reproduction.

The CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19: Violence against Women, in its

recommendation on Article 11, states that equality in employment can be seriously

impaired when women are subjected to gender-specific violence, such as sexual

harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually

determined behaviour as physical contact and advances, sexually coloured remarks,

showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such conduct

can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory

when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage

her in connection with her employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it

creates a hostile working environment.

Page 12 of 14

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution recognizes that a citizen has the freedom to engage by

himself or in association with others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business

or enterprise. The fundamental right to engage in a lawful occupation, profession, trade,

business or enterprise is dependent on the creation of an environment free from sexual

harassment.

In Manohari Pelaketiya v. H.M. Gunasekera, Secretary, Mininstry of Education and

Others (supra.), Court was of the view (at page 16) that sexual harassment or work place

stress and strain occasioned by oppressive and burdensome conduct under colour of

executive office would be an infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner in

that case.

Article 4(d) of the Constitution requires the fundamental rights which are by the

Constitution declared and recognized to be respected, secured and advanced by all the

organs of government. The Appellant is a state-owned enterprise and hence bound by this

positive obligation. Thus, it must adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of sexual

harassment. Where any employee is found guilty of such sexual harassment, even for the

first time, the Appellant is justified in terminating his or her services. In my view, this

applies to both the public and private sectors.

The conduct of the Respondent amounts to grave misconduct. It formed part of a revolting

culture amongst some flying stewards at Sri Lanka Airlines. There had been many oral

complaints of sexual harassment during the period 2004-2005. In addition to the

complaints, around 100-200 flight stewardesses had resigned during this period. Later the

management of Sri Lanka Airlines had taken necessary steps to constitute a committee to

further investigate these complaints. There it was observed that a majority of the

complaints were directed against the Respondent which consisted of about 80 complaints.

Page 13 of 14

In fact, the witness, a Cabin Manager, summoned on behalf of the Respondent testified

that a lot of complaints on sexual harassment had been received during his service period.

He stated that a lot of complaints were received against the Respondent on sexual

harassment [Appeal Brief page 691].

Moreover, the bad record of the Respondent was clearly manifest in the evidence. The

Respondent had been warned repeatedly, punished and grounded on several occasions

due to misconduct including neglect of duties, leave without notice and excessive

absenteeism. His probationary period had been extended due to his poor performance,

he had to re-sit all exams as he could not meet the standards when tested and on a second

appraisal he was found wanting.

The Respondent also constantly took no pay leave, was warned for reporting late for

flights and did not follow the rules and regulations of the Appellant. He was even

transferred to the airport service department (grounded) due to misconduct.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the two questions of law in the affirmative.

The learned President of the Tribunal erred in holding otherwise. So did the High Court in

affirming the order of the Tribunal.

Accordingly, I set aside both the judgment of the High Court of Negombo dated

19.10.2016 and order of the Tribunal dated 22.10.2013.

I hold that the termination of the services of the Respondent is just and equitable.
