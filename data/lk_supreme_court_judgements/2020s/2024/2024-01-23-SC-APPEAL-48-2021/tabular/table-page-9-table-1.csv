"(Special Provisions) Bill [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills 1990, Vol."
"VI, page 3 at page 5] this Court observed as follows:"
"“It needs to be emphasised that legal provisions for the expedi(cid:415)ous recovery of debts"
"–  not  before  they  fall  due,  but  a(cid:332)er  default  by  the  borrowers  –  by  banking  and"
"ﬁnancial ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)ons are not burdens or puni(cid:415)ve measures imposed on borrowers."
"Expedi(cid:415)ous debt recovery is, in the long-term, beneﬁcial to borrowers in general for"
"at least two reasons. Firstly, expedi(cid:415)ous repayment or recovery of debts enhances"
"the  ability  of  lending  ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)ons  to  lend  to  other  borrowers.  Secondly,  the  Law’s"
"delays in respect of debt recovery, howsoever and by whomsoever caused, tend to"
"make lending ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)ons much more cau(cid:415)ous and slow in lending: by refusing some"
"applica(cid:415)ons, by requiring higher security from some borrowers, and by insis(cid:415)ng on"
"more stringent terms as to interest from other borrowers. Expedi(cid:415)ous debt recovery"
"will thus tend to make credit available more readily and on easier terms, and will"
"maximise the ﬂow of  money into the economy. Undoubtedly, there is a legi(cid:415)mate"
"na(cid:415)onal interest in expedi(cid:415)ng the recovery of debts by lending ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)ons engaged"
"in  the business of  providing  credit,  and  thereby s(cid:415)mula(cid:415)ng  the na(cid:415)onal economy"
"and na(cid:415)onal development.” [emphasis added]"
