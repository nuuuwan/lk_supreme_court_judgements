"A cheque issued by one person to another may amount to a promise in wri(cid:415)ng that the"
"sum  reﬂected  in  such  cheque  is  owed  by  the  former  to  the  la(cid:425)er.  In  a  customer-bank"
"rela(cid:415)onship however, even though a cheque presented by a customer and honoured by"
"the bank in spite of a lack of funds in the customer’s account is reﬂec(cid:415)ve of an oﬀer and"
"acceptance and is undoubtedly an overdraft, such a cheque may not amount to a promise"
"or agreement in writing by the customer that he or she owes such sum of money to the"
"bank. Therefore, for the purposes of the Act, it appears that an action cannot be based"
"only on such cheque for the simple reason that it is not reflective of a written promise or"
"agreement made to the bank and is therefore outside the purview of the Act."
