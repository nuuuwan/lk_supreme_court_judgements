"The posi(cid:415)on in this regard can therefore be summarised as follows:","",""
"(","1)","Sec(cid:415)on 4(1) requires copies of the instrument, agreement or document sued upon"
"","","to be ﬁled in Court for the purpose of serving it on the defendants, and therefore"
"","","means that such copies must form part of the plaint. This is reﬂected in Sec(cid:415)on 50"
"","","of the Civil Procedure Code which provides that, “If a plain(cid:415)ﬀ sues upon a document"
"","","in his possession or power, he shall produce it in court when the plaint is presented,"
"","","and shall at the same (cid:415)me deliver the document or a copy thereof to be ﬁled with"
"","","the plaint.”;"
"(","2)","Given the fact that a plain(cid:415)ﬀ is en(cid:415)tled ex parte to a decree nisi in the ﬁrst instance"
"","","and therea(cid:332)er the burden of disproving that the sum men(cid:415)oned in the decree nisi"
"","","is owed is on the defendant, it is cri(cid:415)cal for the District Court to be sa(cid:415)sﬁed in the"
"","","ﬁrst instance itself that there is in fact a promise or agreement in wri(cid:415)ng and that"
"","","the said promise or agreement is the basis of the ac(cid:415)on before Court;"
"(","3)","In terms of Sec(cid:415)on 4(2), at the (cid:415)me the decree nisi is issued ex parte, the Court must"
"","","be  sa(cid:415)sﬁed  that  the 
instrument,  agreement  or  document  has  been  properly"
"","","stamped and is not open to suspicion by reason of any altera(cid:415)on or erasure on the"
"","","face of such document. The best way for the Court to be sa(cid:415)sﬁed of this fact is for a"
"","","copy of the agreement to be annexed to the plaint. Sec(cid:415)on 8 enables the Court to"
"","","call for the original of the agreement in order to clarify any doubts that the Court"
"","","may have with regard to the contents or authen(cid:415)city of the agreement;"
"(","4)","The requirement laid down in Sec(cid:415)on 23, which is reproduced below, can only be"
"","","sa(cid:415)sﬁed by the District Court if a copy of the agreement is presented to Court with"
"","","the plaint:"
