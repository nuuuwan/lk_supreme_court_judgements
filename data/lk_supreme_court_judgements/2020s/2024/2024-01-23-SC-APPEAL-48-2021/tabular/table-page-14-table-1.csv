in  his  dissen(cid:415)ng  judgment 
in  Mahavidanage  Simpson"
"Kularatne v People’s Bank [supra; at page 19] held that, “… this court has consistently held"
"that ac(cid:415)ons ins(cid:415)tuted under the Debt Recovery Act to recover a debt must be based on a"
"promise or agreement in wri(cid:415)ng so that ‘wri(cid:425)en evidence of the commitment on the part"
"of the debtor’ could be prima facie established before entering the decree nisi.”"
"I
t is important to note that this deﬁni(cid:415)on of debt does not refer to by name the wri(cid:425)en"
"promise or agreement or the instrument under which the money is owed – e.g., whether"
"it  is  a  term  loan  agreement,  a  pledge  loan  agreement,  an  overdra(cid:332)  agreement  etc."
"Therefore, the District Court must not be inﬂuenced or guided by the name assigned to"
"the credit facility under which the monies have been granted to a customer."

n Kiran Atapa(cid:425)u v Pan Asia Bank Limited [(2005) 2 Sri LR 276; at page 279], the Court of"
"Appeal, referring to an argument that the defendant has not obtained a loan but only an"
"overdra(cid:332) which does  not come  within the  meaning of ‘debt’ in Sec(cid:415)on 30, and having"
"referred  to  the  deﬁni(cid:415)on  of  debt,  stated  that,  “Therefore  whether  one  calls  the  sum"
"borrowed an overdra(cid:332) or a  loan, if it is capable of being ascertained it falls within  the"
"meaning  of  debt  under  sec(cid:415)on  30  of 
the  Debt  Recovery 
(Special  Provisions)  Act."
"Accordingly, there is no merit in the submissions made by the learned President's Counsel"
"for the Defendant  that  the capital  sum claimed  by the plain(cid:415)ﬀ does  not  fall  within the"
"meaning of ‘debt’ in terms of sec(cid:415)on 30 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act. It is"
"my  further  view  that  the  term  ‘debt’  described  in  sec(cid:415)on  30  includes  overdra(cid:332)s,  if  the"
"amount is capable of being ascertained or is ascertained at the (cid:415)me of ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on of the"
"ac(cid:415)on.”"

"rejecting an argument that the Act “is not applicable to claims based on recovery on credit"
"facilities  or  on  overdraft  facilities  and  that  Debt  Recovery  (Special  Provisions)  Act  is"
"applicable only to fixed/term loans where the amount due is clearly ascertainable” held"
"that the transactions which were referred to in the plaint fell well within the definition of"
"debt."
