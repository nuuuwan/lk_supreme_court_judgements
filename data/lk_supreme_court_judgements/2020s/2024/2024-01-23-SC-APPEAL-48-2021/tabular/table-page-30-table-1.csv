"‘uncondi(cid:415)onal leave’ to appear. Leave to appear is always subject to condi(cid:415)ons. The"
"least  being  furnishing  security  as  the  court  thinks  ﬁt.  As  discussed  earlier  the"
"inten(cid:415)on of the Legislature has to be fulﬁlled and the purpose of the Act should not"
"be brought to naught by a court relying on technical objec(cid:415)ons to defeat the very"
"purpose of the Act.”"
