"“ … when the literal rule of interpretation is applied to the phrases ‘on such terms"
"as to security’ ‘or otherwise as the court thinks fit’, it is clear that the legislature"
"has  intentionally  used  two  different  phrases  to  enable  the  court  to  make  two"
"different  types  of  orders.  The  use  of  the  conjunction  ‘or’  empowers  the  court  to"
"make either of the orders as is necessary to safeguard the interests of the plaintiff.”"
"“… the phrase ‘or otherwise as the court thinks fit’ should be interpreted to enable"
"the court to make an appropriate order as it thinks fit, including an order granting"
"leave  to  appear  and  show  cause  against  the  decree  nisi  without  the  defendant"
"furnishing any security.” [pages 16-17]"
