"“ (ii) Sec(cid:415)on 2(1) of the original Act empowers a lending ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on to have recourse"
"to the special procedure to recover a debt due to such ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on. The term ‘debt’ is"
"deﬁned in Sec(cid:415)on 30 as amended by Act No. 9 of 1994. In terms of this deﬁni(cid:415)on a"
"debt would include any sum of money which is due to a lending ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on arising"
"from a transac(cid:415)on had in the course of its business. It is signiﬁcant that the deﬁni(cid:415)on"

"promise or agreement which is not in wri(cid:415)ng’."
