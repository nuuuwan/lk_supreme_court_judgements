"(","1)","The use of the words, “on such terms” applies to “security, framing and recording of"
"","","issues, or otherwise as the court thinks fit” and therefore terms or conditions must"
"","","be imposed when granting leave;"
"(","2)","The  words,  “otherwise  as  the  court  thinks  fit”  cannot  be  read  to  mean  that  the"
"","","District Court is empowered to grant leave with no terms or conditions whatsoever;"
"(","3)","Leave to appear therefore cannot be granted without terms or conditions;"
"(","4)","The District Court does indeed have a wide discretion with regard to the terms on"
"","","which leave can be granted, as demonstrated by the use of the words “otherwise as"
"","","the  court 
thinks  ﬁt”,  with 
the  only 
limitation  on  such  discretion  being 
the"
"","","requirement of the imposition of ‘a’ term;"
"(","5)","It is not mandatory to impose security, as evinced by the use of the conjunction “or”;"
"(","6)","In imposing terms, the District Court must be mindful of the objectives of the Act,"
"","","and its discretion must be exercised judicially."
