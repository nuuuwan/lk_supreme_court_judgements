"In  Dharmaratna  v  People’s  Bank  [(2003)  3  Sri  LR  307],  the  Court  of  Appeal,  having"
"referred to the definition of debt, rejected the argument of the defendant that the decree"
"absolute was void and/or a nullity for the reason that an overdraft is not a debt or a loan"
"and is therefore outside the purview of the Act."
"A
t this juncture, there are two things that I wish to stress."
"T
he ﬁrst is that it is not the nomenclature of the credit facility that ma(cid:425)ers, but inter alia"
"whether the sum is owed under a promise or agreement that is in wri(cid:415)ng and whether"
"the other requirements in Sec(cid:415)on 2 and the deﬁni(cid:415)on of ‘debt’ have been sa(cid:415)sﬁed. Thus,"
"it is open to a lending ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on to resort to the Act in order to recover any monies owed"
"to it so long as that sum of money is (a) owed under a promise or agreement that is in"
"wri(cid:415)ng, (b) the said sum is ascertained or capable of being ascertained, and (c) sa(cid:415)sﬁes"
"the other requirements in the said deﬁni(cid:415)on."
"T
he second is the danger of insis(cid:415)ng on using a par(cid:415)cular nomenclature in order to invoke"
"the  provisions  of  the  Act,  especially  with  regard  to  overdra(cid:332)s,  for  the  reason  that  an"
"overdra(cid:332) can take many forms and therefore, a clariﬁca(cid:415)on is perhaps appropriate at this"
"stage.  In  People’s  Bank  v  Jagoda  Gamage  Nishantha  Pradeep  Kumara  [SC  Appeal  No."
"234/2017; SC Minutes of 12th December 2022] this Court, having examined in detail the"
"nature of an overdra(cid:332) facility, has iden(cid:415)ﬁed its diﬀerent forms. Accordingly, a bank may"
"allow a customer who does not have suﬃcient funds in his or her current account and"
"who  does  not  have  a  pre-determined  arrangement  reﬂected  by  way  of  a  wri(cid:425)en"
"agreement with the bank, to overdraw his or her account by simply honouring a cheque"
"presented by such customer."
"W
hile in  terms  of  Section  73  of  the  Bills  of Exchange Ordinance, “A  cheque is  a bill  of"
"exchange drawn on a banker payable on demand”, Section 3 of the Ordinance provides"
"that, “A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to"
"another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to"
"pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to"
"the order of a specified person, or to bearer.” [emphasis added]"
