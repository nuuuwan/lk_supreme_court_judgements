    "text": "(ii) Secon 2(1) of the original Act empowers a lending instuon to have recourse to the special procedure to recover a debt due to such instuon. The term debt is dened in Secon 30 as amended by Act No. 9 of 1994. In terms of this denion a debt would include any sum of money which is due to a lending instuon arising from a transacon had in the course of its business. It is signicant that the denion has a clear reservaon that a debt does not include a sum of money owed under a promise or agreement which is not in wring. In view of the reservaon the special procedure could be resorted to only in instances where there is a wrien promise or agreement on the basis of which the sum due is claimed. This is broadly similar to the provision in the summary procedure on liquid claims. The amendment in clause 8 of the Bill, repeals the denion of the term debt in secon 30. The substuted denion excludes the words referred to above which limit its applicability to money owed under a promise or agreement which is in wring. The resulng posion is that the court would not have any wrien evidence of the commitment on the part of the debtor when it issues decree nisi in the rst instance. We are inclined to agree with the submission of the Peoners that the two amendments referred to above would extend the applicaon of the special procedure which is more stringent from the point of the debtor, to a wider category of persons and to any transacon had with the lending instuons, even in the absence of a wrien promise or agreement to pay. We are further of the view that there is no raonal basis to extend the provisions of the Act that is presently in force in the manner referred to in (i) and (ii) above.",
