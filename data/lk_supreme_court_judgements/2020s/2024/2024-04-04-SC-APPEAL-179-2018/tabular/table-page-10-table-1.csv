"Thus, one must note that the term 'burden  of proof'could operate in two forms:  firstly,  as a"
"general  burden  of proof which would  not generally  shift; secondly,  as a particular burden"

"shall lie on the Party-Noticed-Appellant. In this regard, the provision  in Section 103 of the"
"Evidence  ordinance  would  be relevant. It states that the burden  of proof as to any particular"
"fact lies on that person  who wishes  the court to believe  in its existence  unless it is provided"
