"A. L. SHIRAN  GOONERATNE,  J"
"The Party-Noticed-Appellant  is before this court  aggrieved by the impugned  order  dated"
"02/ltl20t5  where the Commercial High Court of the Western  Province holden  in Colombo,"
"held that in an application made  under section 370 (2) of the Companies  Act, the burden  was"
"on the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant to prove his case  and  accordingly  to commence the case."
"I have had the privilege of reading  the judgment  of my brother Hon. Justice P. Padman"
"Surasena  in draft and to consider the views  expressed  therein,land  I disagree  that for the"
"reasons  to be set out hereinafter, the appeal should  be allowed.  To avoid any repetition,  I will"
"refrain from  a detailed discussion  of the facts relevant  to the original application."
"The Liquidator  had  filed a notice by way of a motion under  section  370(1).  The Party-Noticed-"
"Appellant had applied  to Court under section 370(2)  within the specified  time period."
"Had the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant  not applied  to Court under section  370(2)  or not applied  to"
"Coutt within the specified  time period, then  section  370(3)  would have  applied and the"
"presumption in favor  of the Liquidator  under section  370(3) would have  come into operation"
"in having  the transaction deemed  to be set aside.  That is, however, not the case here."
"The  fact that the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant  had applied to Cout within  the specified  time period"
"under section  37Ae) indicates  their intention  to argue that the transaction  is not void."
"The Liquidator is relying on section 367 to have the transactions relating  to the transfers of"
"lands  (described  in the Commercial  High Court  Order)  set aside as void."
"The  presumptions  applicable  to sections 367 land 369, although not applicable  in this"
"instancel  apply only in respect  to the time period  at which the transactions  in question  took"
"place. That  is, in respect to section  367, section  367(2)  states "" lJnless  the contrary is proved,"
"for the purposes of subsection (1), a transaction that took  place  within the restricted  period"
"is presumed to have  been  made at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts as"
"they fell dLte."",  [and in respect  to section 369, section  369(4)  states ""(Jnless  the contrary is"
"proved  for the purposes of subsection (1), a transaction  that took place within the restricted"
"period is presumed  to have been made at a time when the company  was  unable to pay its"
"debits  as they  fe// due.'1."
"It is important  to note  that although  the Liquidator  can rely on the presumptions described"
"above,  sections  367 [and 369] require the Liquidator  to prove  additional  matters to succeed"
"in establishing  a claim  to have the transactions  declared voidable under  these  sections."
