"Act. At the same time,  one must not forget the legal burden  set out in Section 101  of the"
"Evidence  Ordinance  which states  thus:"
"""Whoever desires  any court to give judgment  as to any lega/  right  or liability dependent"
"on the existence  of facts  which he asserts must prove that those  facts exist."
"As it is the Liquidator  who had made  the initial  application  under  Section  367 read with Section"
"370(1) of the Companies  Act, in terms  of Section i01 of the Evidence  ordinance,  the  legal"
"burden is on the Liquidator to establish the fact  he asserts."
"Although  the legal burden according to Section  101 of the Evidence  Ordinance is on the"
"Liquidator to establish the fact he asserts, I must also take  into account that according  to"
"Section  367(2)  of the Companies Act, unless the contrary  is proved,  a transaction that took"
"place within the restricted period  is presumed to have been made at a time  when the company"
"was unable to pay its debts as they fell due fforthe purposes  of subsection  (1)]."
