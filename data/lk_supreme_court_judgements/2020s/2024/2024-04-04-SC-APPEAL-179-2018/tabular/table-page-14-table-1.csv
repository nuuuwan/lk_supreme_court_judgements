"In the New Zealand  case of Mike Hastie Handcraft wools  Limited (in voluntary  Liquidation)"
"(Unreported'  M'37187, Napier  Registry,21  December  19BB),  Greig J dealing with similar"
"provisions  in the New Zealand Companies Act, said"
"""It sti// remains  the position  under the Act that the starting point of the procedure s the fact"
"that the disposition  is voidab/e under s. 309 or s. 3ll of the Act. rn the words  of the Act, it is"
"the wish of the /iquidator to set aside  which  motiuates the procedure but that depends  upon"
"the fact that the disposition  s in truth voidab/e under  the sections. That is a maffer which  the"
"liquidator  has to prove  and so he must carry both the initia/ and the u/timate onus, the"
"evidential and the substantive  onus to show that this is a voidab/e  transaction.  It is the"
"/iquidator that makes the claim  that it is voidab/e  even though that s by notice which,  if there"
"is no opposition,  wi// be sutffcient  in itse/f. But where there s opposition it must  bg and it"
"ought  to be for the liquidator  to adduce some evidence  to justifii that.,,"
"Furthermore,  in the case of Hastie (referred to above), Greig  J went on to say;"
""" It seems  to me that in practice it is beffer  for the /iquidator,  who is the representative  of the"
"company  and its affairg to produce  the evidence,  not on/y of the date of the /iquidation and"
"the date of the disposition, but a/so such  other materia/ from the records of the company"
"rt'thich supports the /iquidator's  c/aim that this is a voidab/e  disposition.  Then it is for the"
"creditor  or d/sponee  to furnish any defensive  averment or to produce  evidence in support of"
"any posltive  c/aim by way of re/ief or excuse of the avoidance  of the disposition.,,"
