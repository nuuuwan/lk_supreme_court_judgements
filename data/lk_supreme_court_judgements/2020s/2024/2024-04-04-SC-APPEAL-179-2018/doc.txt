The Petitioner-Respondent is a person who had made cerLain investments in 2006 in theCompany by the name of Touchwood Investments (Private) Ltd. which had promised him

[SC Appeal L79/20181 - page 4 of t6,

returns in 20L2. As Touchwood Investments (Private) Ltd. had informed him of its inability tomake payments as promised, the Petitioner-Respondent on or around 24-07-2073 had filed aPetition seeking an order from CourL for the winding up of Touchwood Investments (private)Ltd. It is upon this Petition that the Commercial High Court had made an order dated 05-06-2074 to wind-up the said Company. It is in that process that the Court had appointed G.K.Sudath Kumara as the Liquidator. He has been named in this Appeal as the Liquidator-Respondent who will hereinafter sometimes be referred to as the Liquidator.

The Liquidator had got to know that Touchwood Investments (Private) Ltd. (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the Company under liquidation) had caused the transfer of its variousassets which are immovable properties to the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant. Thereafter, theLiquidator had filed the Motion dated 23-11-2015 in the Commercial High Court under Section367 read with Section 370(1) of the Companies Act No. 07 of ZOO7. This Motion has beenproduced, marked Pl. According to this Motion, the Liquidator had informed Court that theCompany under liquidation had transferred the five properties referred to in the said Motionunder (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) to the Pafi-Noticed, namely Dr. Noel Pratheepan Somasundaramduringthe period specified in Section 373(2) of the CompaniesAct No. 07 of 2007. Itwas inthose circumstances that the Liquidator had complained to the Commercial High Court thatthe said transactions entered into by the company under liquidation are voidable in terms ofSection 367 of the Companies Act as the said transactions had taken place at a time whenthe company under liquidation was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, and within thespecified period and enabled another person to receive more than the person would otherwisehave received or likely to have received in the liquidation proceedings.

Upon the Motion Pl being filed, the Commercial High Court had issued notice on the party-

Noticed' Thereafter the Party-Noticed-Appellan! having come to Court, had sought a dismissalof the relief sought by the Liquidator as per the Motion Pt, and the learned Judge of theCommercial High Court had then fixed the matter for inquiry. At the commencement of theinquiry, the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant had contended that the burden to prove the mattersstated in the Motion Pl must be on the Liquidator and therefore it is the Liquidator who shallcommence the leading of evidence in order to prove the matters stated in his Motion pl.

In contradistinction to the above position, the Liquidator had taken up the position before theCommercial High Court that it murst be the Party-Noticed-Appellant who has the burden ofproof and therefore it is he who must satisfy Court that the transactions referred to by theLiquidator are not voidable under the law.

ISC Appeal I79lZOlB] - page 5 of 16

Having considered the material adduced by both parLies, the learned Judge of the commercialHigh court, by his order dated o2-11-20L7, had held that the party-Noticed-Appellant mustcommence the inquiry.

Being dissatisfied with the orderdated o2-Lr-2017 of the commercial High court, the party-Noticed-Appellant had preferred the instant appeal to this court. when the Leave to AppealApplication relevant to the instant Appeal was supporLed, this courL having considered thesubmissions of the learned counsel for both parties, by its order dated 72-77-2orl, hadgranted Leave to Appear on the foilowing questions of raw:1) whether the court ered in /aw and/or mrsdirected itse/f when it determined the

issue of who should commence the inquiry, in respect of the petitioner, by reference

to documents annexed by, and matters p/eaded by, Mr. Don Raja Elmo Jayamaha.2) Whether the court ered in /aw and/or misdirected itself in /aw when it failed toappreciate that it is the Liquidator who should commence an inquiry under section370 of the companies Act No. 07 of 2007 in relation to an application by theLiquidator under Section 362.

Since the Liquidator had filed the Motion Pl under Section 367 read with section 370(1), letme at the outset reproduce below the said sections of the companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

367' (1) A transaction by a company s voidab/e on the application of the /iquidator,if the transaction -

For the five reasons I shall henceforLh set out below, I am of the view that it must be theParty-Noticed-Appellant who must commence the inquiry.

The first reason is the existence of a presumption in terms of Section 367(2) of the CompaniesAct. At the same time, one must not forget the legal burden set out in Section 101 of the

Evidence Ordinance which states thus:

"Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any lega/ right or liability dependenton the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.

As it is the Liquidator who had made the initial application under Section 367 read with Section370(1) of the Companies Act, in terms of Section i01 of the Evidence ordinance, the legalburden is on the Liquidator to establish the fact he asserts.

Although the legal burden according to Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance is on theLiquidator to establish the fact he asserts, I must also take into account that according to

Section 367(2) of the Companies Act, unless the contrary is proved, a transaction that took

place within the restricted period is presumed to have been made at a time when the companywas unable to pay its debts as they fell due fforthe purposes of subsection (1)].

ISC Appeal t79l20t9] - page 9 of 16

Thus, all what the Liquidator needs to establish at the outset to discharge its legal burden, isthe fact that the questionable transactions had taken place within the restricted periodreferred to in Section 373(2) of the Companies Act. Once that fact is established by theLiquidator, then the relevant questionable transactions which had taken place within therestricted period are presumed to have been made at a time when the company was unableto pay its debts as they fell due. This presumption is drawn unless the contrary is proved. Thenext question is as to who must prove the contrary. The next set of reasons would show thatit must be the Party-Noticed-Appellant who must then prove the contrary.

The second reason is that it would be the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant who would fail if noevidence at all were given and hence it must be the Party-Noticed-Appellant who mustcommence the inquiry. According to Section 370(3), after the Liquidator had filed the motionwith notice to the parLy, notice under section 370(1) of the Act, the party-Noticed will have20 working days to make an application under Section 370(3) of the Act. Section 370(3) alsoprovides that if no such application is made, then the questionable transaction willautomatically stand set aside. One could draw support for this proposition from Section 102of the Evidence Ordinance which states thus:

"the burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who wou/d fail if noevidence at all were given on either side,,

E' R' S. R' Coomaraswamy states on Section t02 of the Evidence ordinance, as follows:

"This section deals with the incidence of the burden. It places the burden ofproof on the party who desires the court to intervene and to determine therights of the partres in a manner different from the position that wou/d arise ifmatters were left in status quo. It regulates the incidence of the overa/lburden".1

Section 370(3) has provided that the questionable transaction will automatically stand setaside in the absence of any such application. Not providing any evidence; not pursuing theapplication made under Section 370(3) of the Act; are all as good as not making any suchapplication. Therefore Section 102 of the Evidence Ordinance will apply to the case at hand.

The third reason is because the essential facts necessary for the determination by Court underthe circumstances at hand are especially within the knowledge of the pafi-Noticed-Appellant.

1 E' R' S' R. Coomaraswamy; The Law of Evidence; Stamford Lake 2013; at page 255 of Volume II(Book I).

fSC Appeal 779120781 - pase 10 of 16

Looking at the above several transactions which are said to have taken place during therelevant time, it is clear that the questionable transfers of immovable property have beeneffected by way of notarially executed deeds of transfer the beneficiary of which is Dr. NoelSomasundaram who stands as the Party-Noticed-Appellant in this case, In all six transfers,the beneficiary is the Party-Noticed-Appellant. The consideration mentioned in all those Deedsof Transfer have been paid by the Party-Noticed-Appellant. Therefore, it is clear that it is thePafi-Noticed-Appellant who knows best, the real nature and the circumstances under whichhe had purchased these properties from the company under liquidation.

The above position is furLher buttressed by Section 106 of the Evidence ordinance whichstates "when any fact is especia//y within the know/edge of any person, the burden of provingthat fact is upon him."The provision in section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance is furtherexplained by its two illustrations which are reproduced below:

Il/ustration (a.t: when a person does an act with some intention other than that whichthe character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving thatintention is upon him.

Illustration (b-): A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket. The burdenof proving that he had a ticket is on him.

Thus, one must note that the term 'burden of proof'could operate in two forms: firstly, as ageneral burden of proof which would not generally shift; secondly, as a particular burdenwhich may shift during the proceedings in Court.

The fourth reason is that it would be the Par[y-Noticed-Appellant who would wish the courtto believe that the five transactions relevant to the inquiry at hand are not questionabletransactions falling under Section 367 of the Companies Act and therefore the proof thereofshall lie on the Party-Noticed-Appellant. In this regard, the provision in Section 103 of theEvidence ordinance would be relevant. It states that the burden of proof as to any particularfact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence unless it is providedby any law the proof shall lie on any particular person.

It is true that it is the Liquidator who had made the initial application under Section 367 readwith Section 370(1) of the Companies Act. As has been stated in Section 103 of the Evidenceordinance, the relevant law in this case is the companies Act No. 07 of 2oo7 which does notprovide that the proof of this fact shall lie on any particular person. Therefore, according to

[Sl Appeal 179/2}fi] - Page 11 of i6

Section 103 of the Evidence Qrdinance, the burden of proof of such fact m ust lle on the person

who wishes cor;ft to believe in its existence" It is the Party:Noticed-Appellant who wishes the

court to believe lhat the conrplained transactions are of such a nature that they would not fali

under Section 370 and Section 357 of the Cornpanies Act. If the Party-Noticed-Appellant didnot make this application on this basis, the Liquidator wouid not be called upon to establishthat the conrplained transactions would fail under the relevant sections. This is ecause thelaw had provided for autornatic setting aside of the complained transactions in the absencef any such application from the noticed party.

On the other hand, if an appiication is rnade under Section 370(2) of the Act, then the

questlonable transaction can only be set aside after hearing and deterrnining that application

(the application here rneans the application made under Section 370{3) of the Act). Therefore,

despite the fact that the lnitial application under Section 370{2) of the Act is made to court bythe Liquidator, for further proceedings upon the application nrade by the Party-Noticed-

Appellant under Section 370(3) of the Act would switch the said further proceedings from

"automatic setting aside procedureo'to one in which the Court would make a determination of

the application made by the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant r,rnder S*ction 370{3) of the Act. This is

because it is the Party-Noticed- Appellant who seeks an order from Court that the questionable

tnansactions should not be set aside. Thus, the Court proceedings from that polnt onwards

would be to deterrnine the appiication made by the par1ry-Noticed-Appellant,

The Farty=Noticed-Appellant had primarily relied on the following paragraph taken fron'r

cempany Law by Kanaganayagam Kanag-isvaran and Dilshani wijayawardana2,

"it is inrpo*ant to note that section 370 does not operate to shift the onus of proof for

establishing that a transaction comes within section 357 or 369 or that a charge comeswithin sectlon 368. The onus remains with the liquidator. The secticn is oniy a

convenient way of disposing of the need for court proceedinEs where there is no

contest. However, if the posltion is contesled liquidator still bears the onr":s of proof."

The learned authors of the above work, in con:ing to this conclusion had relied on three casesreferred to in its footnotes 29 and 30. These cases appear to have been decided on the

provisions in New Zealand's Companies Act of 1955 and 1993. Flowever, in vlew of the clear

provisions in our Evidence Ordinance coupled with the fact that the Corr'lpanies Act No 07 of

'{2014} ar page 590.

ISC Appeal L79l2ALt{ - page 12 of i6

2007 had not speeified thrat the Broof of this fact shall lie an any particslar pers,on, our courtsare bound to stick to the law of Evidence in our law.

On the other hand, to rny rnind, what the authors of the above work may haye intended lsnot what the learned e-ounsel who appeared for the Party-Floticed-Appellant subnnits as a{.}argument before us' While tr ann unable to eonirnent as to the intention behind the absvestatement nrade by the writers of the absve book, it may well be an assentisn of the positionthat the legal burderr rernaiRs sn the Liquidator to establish the faet he assergs in teryns ofSeet[on 101 of the Evidence Ordinanee, as it is the Liquidater who had made the ic?itialapplieatior: under Section 367 read with Section 370{1} of the Companies Aet. However, Inrny view, it must not be understsod that the said authors have negated the effect of ff.leexistence of the presurnption in ten'ns sf Section 367{2) of the Companies Affi by vlrtue ofwhich presunrpfioR, the evidentiary burden should stand shifted to_she party-fitotieed-

ApBellant to establlsh the position taken up by him that these questionahle transacriens dsnot fall uRder Sectiom 370 and Seetion 367 of the Companies Act. This is exactly what tr haveadverted to above.

Thus, I am unable to aceept the absve argumeRt advaneed by the learned CsLInse[ whoappeared far the Party-Noticed:ABpeX lant.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the questions of law in respect of which this fourt hasgranted Leave tc Appea!, in the negative. I proceed to affirrn the order dated AZ-Lt-Z*t7pronouneed by the Cornn"lercial High Court whieh had held that the Fariy-hloticed-Appellan.t

musf eornrnence the inquirry as the burden of proving that the complained transactions are sfsuch a nature that they r,vould nst fall under Seetion 370 and Section 362 of the CcmpanlesAct is upon the PartT-Ncticed-Appellant.

Thls Appeal is therefore dismissed with cCIsts.

JUDGE OF THE SUPR,EME COURT

[SC Appeal 179120L8] - Page 13 of 16

A. L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J

The Party-Noticed-Appellant is before this court aggrieved by the impugned order dated02/ltl20t5 where the Commercial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo,

held that in an application made under section 370 (2) of the Companies Act, the burden was

on the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant to prove his case and accordingly to commence the case.

I have had the privilege of reading the judgment of my brother Hon. Justice P. Padman

Surasena in draft and to consider the views expressed therein,land I disagree that for the

reasons to be set out hereinafter, the appeal should be allowed. To avoid any repetition, I will

refrain from a detailed discussion of the facts relevant to the original application.

The Liquidator had filed a notice by way of a motion under section 370(1). The Party-Noticed-

Appellant had applied to Court under section 370(2) within the specified time period.

Had the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant not applied to Court under section 370(2) or not applied to

Coutt within the specified time period, then section 370(3) would have applied and the

presumption in favor of the Liquidator under section 370(3) would have come into operation

in having the transaction deemed to be set aside. That is, however, not the case here.

The fact that the Pafi-Noticed-Appellant had applied to Cout within the specified time period

under section 37Ae) indicates their intention to argue that the transaction is not void.

The Liquidator is relying on section 367 to have the transactions relating to the transfers of

lands (described in the Commercial High Court Order) set aside as void.

The presumptions applicable to sections 367 land 369, although not applicable in this

instancel apply only in respect to the time period at which the transactions in question took

place. That is, in respect to section 367, section 367(2) states " lJnless the contrary is proved,

for the purposes of subsection (1), a transaction that took place within the restricted period

is presumed to have been made at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts as

they fell dLte.", [and in respect to section 369, section 369(4) states "(Jnless the contrary is

proved for the purposes of subsection (1), a transaction that took place within the restricted

period is presumed to have been made at a time when the company was unable to pay its

debits as they fe// due.'1.

It is important to note that although the Liquidator can rely on the presumptions described

above, sections 367 [and 369] require the Liquidator to prove additional matters to succeed

in establishing a claim to have the transactions declared voidable under these sections.

fSC Appeal tTglZOtB) _ page t4 of t6

That is' with respect to section 367, section 367(1)(b) requires the Liquidator to establish thatthe transactions in question "entit/ed anotherperson to receive more towards satisfaction ofa debt that the person wou/d otherwse have received or be /ike/y to have received in the/iquidation'", section 367(3) requires the Liquidator to establish that,,........ unless the companywas inf/uenced in entering into the transaction by a desire to produce in re/ation to thatperson/ the effect mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection (l),i

fsimilarly' with respect to section 369, section 369(b) requires the Liquidator to establish that" the transaction was an uncommercial transactior'l" section 36g(c) requires the Liquidator toestablish that" when the transaction took place, the company - (i) was unable to pay its duedebts; (ii) was engaged in or about to engage in business for which its financial resourceswere grossly inadequate; or (iir) incurred an obligation knowrng that the company wou/d notbe able to perform the ob/igation when required to do so, J

In the New Zealand case of Mike Hastie Handcraft wools Limited (in voluntary Liquidation)(Unreported' M'37187, Napier Registry,21 December 19BB), Greig J dealing with similarprovisions in the New Zealand Companies Act, said

"It sti// remains the position under the Act that the starting point of the procedure s the factthat the disposition is voidab/e under s. 309 or s. 3ll of the Act. rn the words of the Act, it isthe wish of the /iquidator to set aside which motiuates the procedure but that depends uponthe fact that the disposition s in truth voidab/e under the sections. That is a maffer which theliquidator has to prove and so he must carry both the initia/ and the u/timate onus, theevidential and the substantive onus to show that this is a voidab/e transaction. It is the/iquidator that makes the claim that it is voidab/e even though that s by notice which, if thereis no opposition, wi// be sutffcient in itse/f. But where there s opposition it must bg and itought to be for the liquidator to adduce some evidence to justifii that.,,

Furthermore, in the case of Hastie (referred to above), Greig J went on to say;

" It seems to me that in practice it is beffer for the /iquidator, who is the representative of thecompany and its affairg to produce the evidence, not on/y of the date of the /iquidation andthe date of the disposition, but a/so such other materia/ from the records of the companyrt'thich supports the /iquidator's c/aim that this is a voidab/e disposition.

eonsiderinE the above, it is nry view that, where the Far|y-frloticed-Appellant has applied tocsurt under seetion 370(2) within the speeified tinre period (as is the case i-rere) the burdenof proof does nst shift to ihe Faffiy-tdoticed-Appellant to defend their position ul-rtii thei-iquidator tras dlseharged their obligation to establish the requirenrents under sections 357[and 369J descnibed above' It is oniy in the event ihe l-iquidator is able to disehange g.leirobllgations with respect ts their burden *f proof reguired under seetions 3G7 [and 36g] thatthe Paffy-Noticed=Appei|ant will be ealled upon to defend their position.

It is elear that the burden cf proof does not shift from the Liquidatcr te the Farty-Notieed-Appellant irrespeetive of the action (or inaction) of the party-fi{otieed-Appellant under section370{2}" This position is suppo*ed by the cornmentary by K" Kanag-trwaran and Di{sha*iwijayawandana, eornpeny Law {aalq at PaEe 6g0 whieh reads as follows;

"{t is important to note tt'tat section 370 does not operate ts sltift the onas of proof fot-establishing that a transaction coffies within sectbn 362 or s6g or that a eharge coffies wthinsection 368" Tfte onas rernarns witlt the liquidator. The secttbn is only a conuenient way ofdisposing of the need for coaft proceedings where there is no contest However, tf the positiontb contested the liguidator still bears the onus of Broof.,,It is a known fact that our eornpanies Act af 2Qa7 is primarily based on the fiiew Zealandfot'l1panies Act of i9931[K. Kanag-Iwaran and Dilshani wgayawardana, cornpany Law {2814J,at p' viiJ' This position has been relied upon by.lustice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Ff in the caseof Jaqa l-anka International (Pvt) Ltd vs Bank of ceylon (5e" AppEAl- 50/Al2n13) decided on3U1CI12023"

Accordingly, it is permissible to rnake reference to deeisions of the Flew Zealand courts inrespect to matters arising in these proceedings, in the absence of decided cases om the suhjectmatter curently in sri Lanka" Accordingly, I rely atso on the decisions of the lsew Zealandeourts referred to above in support of my view.

For the above reasons, where the Party-l\oticed-Appellant had eppiied to fcurt under section370t2) wlthin tl"re speeified tirne period (as is the case hereJ, I am of the view thrat theLiquldator shouxd begin the Inquiry and establish its claim under section 367 before the Farry-fldoticed-Appeflant is cailed upon to defend their position"

Therefore, I answer the questions of law Nos. l^ and z on which leave ts appeal was grantedin the affirmative.

For these reasons, the Appeal ofCommerciaf High Court is set aside.
