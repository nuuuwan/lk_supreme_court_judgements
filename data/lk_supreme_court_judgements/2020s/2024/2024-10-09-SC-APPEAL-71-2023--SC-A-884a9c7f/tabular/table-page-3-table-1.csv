"Samayawardhena, J."
"This  is  a  partition  action  filed  by  the  plaintiff  in  the  District  Court  of"
"Horana on 04.09.1997. After the trial, the judgment was delivered by the"
"District  Court  on  07.03.2007.  Being  aggrieved,  four  parties  preferred"
"appeals  to  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal  of  Kalutara,  which  delivered"
"four judgments on 17.11.2011. On appeal, this Court, by judgment dated"
"11.09.2015, set aside the judgments of the High Court and directed the"
"High  Court  to  hear  the  appeals  afresh  on  the  basis  that  the  said"
"judgments had been delivered without taking steps to substitute the 9th"
"defendant who had passed away while the appeals were pending in the"
"High Court. Thereafter, the 9(a) defendant was substituted in place of the"
"deceased 9th defendant."
"However, when the case record was sent to the High Court on the second"
"occasion,  the  High  Court, 
in  my  view,  adopted  a  more  convenient"
"approach.  The  new  Bench  of 
the  High  Court,  by 
judgment  dated"
"02.04.2018, summarily set aside the judgment of the District Court by"
"stating “it is our view that the judgment dated 07.03.2007 is a judgment,"
"which does not fall within section 187 of the Civil Procedure. Therefore, we"
"set aside the judgment and send this case back to the District Court for the"
"present District Judge to write the judgment on the same pedigree, but if"
"he  so  wishes  he  can  let  the  parties  to  adduce  more  evidence  and  the"
"learned  District  Judge  is  further  directed  to  hear  the  parties  in  terms  of"
"section 184 of the Civil Procedure Code.”"
"Before  reaching  this  conclusion,  the  High  Court,  by  two  sentences"
"referred to two contentions made by the appellant’s counsel against the"
"District Court judgment. However, it did not clarify whether it accepted"
"these two contentions or whether they were sustainable in law. The High"
"Court then stated that the District Judge had failed to provide reasons"
"for the conclusion."
