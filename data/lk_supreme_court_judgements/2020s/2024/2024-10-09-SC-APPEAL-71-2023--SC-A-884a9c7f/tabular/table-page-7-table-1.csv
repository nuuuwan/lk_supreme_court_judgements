"25(2) to file objections to the proposed scheme of partition. In the absence"
"of a specific prohibition it is not possible to presume any such prohibition.”"
"However,  in  the  guise  of  filing  objections  to  the  proposed  scheme  of"
"partition, such a party cannot convert the scheme inquiry into another"
"trial  to  decide 
issues  on  the  pedigree.  As  Soertsz  A.C.J.  stated 
in"
"Appuhamy v. Weeratunge (1945) 46 NLR 461 at 462, “there must be an"
"end  to  a  case,  particularly  to  a  partition  case  which  is  generally  of  a"
"protracted nature and which prevents parties to it from dealing with the"
"land  as  freely  as  they  would  wish  to  in  the  interval.”  In  Hamidu  v."
"Gunasekera (1922) 24 NLR 143 at 145 it was held that “A person entitled"
"merely to an interest in a building on a land which has become the subject"
"of  a  partition  action can  only  obtain  compensation  for  the  interest  in  the"
"building,  and  cannot  get  any  share  of  the  land  in  the  partition.”   In  the"
"instant action, although the 9th defendant does not have soil rights, her"
"claims for improvements need to be safeguarded."
"Section 35 of the Partition Law states: “After the surveyor makes a return"
"to the commission, the court shall call the case in open court and shall fix"
"a  date  for  the  consideration  of  the  scheme  of  partition  proposed  by  the"
"surveyor. The date so fixed shall be a date not earlier than thirty days after"
"the  receipt  of  such  return  by  the  court.”  The  thirty-day  period  shall  be"
"counted not from the date on which the return is received by the Registry"
"but from the date on which it is received in open Court on the returnable"
"date fixed for that purpose by Court (Wickremaratne v. Samarawickrema"
"[1995]  2  Sri  LR  212).  According  to  section  36(1)(a)  “On  the  date  fixed"
"under  section  35,  or  on  any  later  date  which  the  Court  may  fix  for  the"
"purpose,  the  Court  may,  after  summary  inquiry  confirm  with  or  without"
"modification the scheme of partition proposed by the surveyor and enter"
"final decree of partition accordingly.”"
