"SC/APPEAL/71 & 72 of 2023 
                                                       6"
"According to the Preliminary Plan and the Report marked at the trial, the"
"9th defendant has claimed certain buildings and plantations on the land."
"Except for a few trees (which were claimed both by the plaintiff and the"
"9th  defendant),  other  parties  have  not  contested  the  claim  of  the  9th"
"defendant for improvements. Issues have been raised on improvements"
"and  the  District  Judge  has  answered  them  but  apparently  without"
"reasons. I cannot agree with the finding of the High Court that if the 9(a)"
"defendant decides to call evidence, then there should be a statement of"
"claim  filed  by  the  9(a)  defendant.  The  9(a)  defendant  cannot  take  the"
"decision whether or not to call witnesses, “but if he (the District Judge) so"
"wishes he can let the parties to adduce more evidence”."
"The  9(a)  defendant  who  was  substituted  in  place  of  the  deceased  9th"
"defendant, cannot claim rights superior to those the 9th defendant would"
"have  had  if  she  were  alive.  A  substituted  party  cannot  take  up  a  new"
"position contrary to or inconsistent with that of the original party, as he"
"merely steps into the shoes of the original party. If the 9th defendant did"
"not 
file  a  statement  of  claim  or  participate 
in 
the 
trial, 
the 
legal"
"consequences that would follow cannot be cured by the substituted 9(a)"
"defendant presenting himself as a new party, unless the Court decides"
"otherwise in terms of the law. No such decision has been made by the"
"Court."
"For completeness, let me also state that a party to a partition action (not"
"a new party) can file a statement of objection to the proposed scheme of"
"partition before the scheme inquiry (sections 35 and 36 of the Partition"
"Law). The Court cannot deny filing objections on the basis that he has"
"defaulted in filing a statement of claim and participating in the trial. In"
"Anthony  Appu  v.  Margret  Fernando  and  Others  [1999]  3  Sri  LR  85,"
"Weerasuriya  J.  stated  that  “The  Partition  Law  makes  no  prohibition"
"against a party who had failed to participate at the trial in terms of section"
