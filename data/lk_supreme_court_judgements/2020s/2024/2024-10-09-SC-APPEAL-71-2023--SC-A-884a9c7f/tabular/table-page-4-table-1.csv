"SC/APPEAL/71 & 72 of 2023 
                                                       4"
"Judicial decisions must be clear and specific, without leaving room for"
"varying  interpretations.  Clarity  and  specificity  in  judicial  decisions  are"
"essential to maintain the integrity of the law, foster public confidence in"
"the  judiciary,  promote  legal  certainty,  and  uphold  the  rule  of  law.  The"
"above order of the High Court, in my view, is vague. The District Judge"
"has been directed to write the judgment “on the same pedigree” perhaps"
"because, according to the proceedings, the parties agreed to a composite"
"pedigree at the trial. When the direction is to write the judgment based"
"on  the  same  pedigree  accepted  by  Court,  it  precludes  the  parties  from"
"adopting new positions which deviate from that pedigree."
"Thereafter, the District Judge was further directed “to hear the parties in"
"terms of section 184 of the Civil Procedure Code”. I fail to understand how"
"the parties can be heard under section 184 of the Civil Procedure Code,"
"as this section pertains solely to the pronouncement of judgment. There"
"is no provision for a hearing under this section. Section 184(1) reads as"
"follows: “The court, upon the evidence which has been duly taken or upon"
"the facts admitted in the pleadings or otherwise, and after the parties have"
"been  heard  either  in  person  or  by  their  respective  counsel  or  registered"
"attorneys 
(or 
recognized  agents),  shall,  after 
consultation  with 
the"
"assessors (if any), pronounce judgment in open court, either at once or on"
"some  future  day,  of  which  notice  shall  be  given  to  the  parties  or  their"
"registered  attorneys  at  the  termination  of  the  trial.”  The  term  “after  the"
"parties have been heard” in this section does not create a fresh right of"
"hearing."
"According to the High Court, the question was not whether the parties"
"were heard, but  rather that  the  District Judge  did not give reasons for"
"his  findings  in  the  judgment  in  violation  of  section  187  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code."
