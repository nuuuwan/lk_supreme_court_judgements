"District Court by order dated 07.02.2020 on the basis that the High Court"
"had not granted permission to file pleadings. On appeal, the High Court"
"by order dated 10.02.2021 directed  the District Court  to allow the 9(a)"
"defendant to file a statement of claim and proceed with the case stating"
"inter alia that “At a trial or inquiry in a partition action whether a party"
"intends to call evidence or not is up to him and if such party decides to call"
"evidence, then there should be a statement of claim filed by that party.” It"
"is against this order dated 10.02.2021 that the plaintiff and the 5th-7th"

"rights but was made a party as she is living on the land. The 9th defendant"
"did  not  contest  this  fact  by  filing  a  statement  of  claim,  nor  did  she"
"participate in the trial. In other words, the 9th defendant does not come"
"under the pedigree accepted by Court."
