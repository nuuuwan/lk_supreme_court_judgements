Argued on : 17-10-2023

Decided on : 04-04-2024

P. Padman Surasena J

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) has

filed the plaint in the instant case, in the District Court of Mathugama against the 1st

Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Defendant),

praying inter alia, that the corpus relevant to the case, morefully set out in the schedule to

the plaint, be partitioned between him and the 1st Defendant. According to the plaint, the

Plaintiff had claimed entitlement to 2/3 of the corpus and the 1st Defendant was said to be

entitled to 1/3 of the corpus.

Upon a commission being issued in that regard, the Licensed Surveyor having prepared the

Preliminary Plan, i.e., plan No. 1307 dated 27-09-1993, had reported to Court (his report has

been produced marked X) that there are three other persons who had claimed the corpus

which was pointed out by the Plaintiff. According to the Surveyor’s report, the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Defendant), the 3rd

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd Defendant),

and the 4th Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 4th

Defendant), had come forward to claim portions of the corpus. Subsequently, the said persons

along with several others were also named as defendants in the case. As the 3rd Defendant

had passed away subsequently, his wife who stood as the 4th Defendant was substituted in

the place of the 3rd Defendant.

At the outset, it must be observed that the sole question left for the learned District Judge to

decide in this case, was the issue whether the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants had been entitled

to claim Lot 5A of Plan No. 1307 dated 27-09-1993, on the basis that they have established a

prescriptive title to that land. After the trial, the learned District Judge by his judgment dated

30-01-2006, had concluded that the 2nd Defendant is entitled to Lot 5A of the said land and

the 4th Defendant is entitled to Lot 3 of the said land as they had acquired prescriptive title to

[SC Appeal 181/ 2015 with 182/ 2015]

Page 13 of 21

those plots of land. It was on that basis that the learned District Judge had decided to exclude

Lot No. 3 and Lot No. 5A of Plan No. 1307 from the corpus to be partitioned in this action.

Accordingly, the learned District Judge had ordered that Lot No. 8 of the said land be reserved

as a roadway and Lot No. 5B be partitioned between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant in

such a way that the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/3 of the corpus and the 1st Defendant is entitled

to 2/3 of the corpus.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff appealed to the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals of the Western Province, holden at Kalutara. The

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals by its judgment dated 10-07-2013, had altered the

learned District Judge’s judgment, by setting aside the decision of the learned District Judge

to exclude Lot 3 and Lot 5A from the corpus to be partitioned.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 10-07-2013 of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals, the 3A Defendant and the 4th Defendant have lodged SC Appeal 182/2015. When

the Leave to Appeal Application relevant to that appeal was supported, this court by its order

dated 02-11-2015, having heard the submissions of the learned counsel for all parties, has

granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the following questions of law.

1. Did the Civil Appellate High Court misdirect[ed] itself on the concept of

prescriptive title?

2. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in deciding that the Petitioner had not

established prescriptive title to Lot No. 3 in the Preliminary Plan?

3. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in deciding that Lot No. 3 has to be

partitioned among the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant?

The 2nd Defendant also being aggrieved by the judgment dated 10-07-2013 of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals, has lodged SC Appeal 181/2015. When the Leave to Appeal

Application relevant to that appeal was supported, this court by its order dated 02-11-2015,

having heard the submissions of the learned counsel for all parties, has granted Leave to

Appeal in respect of the following questions of law.

1. Whether the learned High Court Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Kalutara have erred in law by setting aside the part of the judgment of the

learned District Judge by which the Lot 5A in preliminary plan No. 1307 was

[SC Appeal 181/ 2015 with 182/ 2015]

Page 14 of 21

excluded from the corpus considering the cogent evidence placed before him

with regard to the 2nd Defendant- Respondent- Petitioner's prescriptive title for

Lot 5A?

2. Whether the learned High Court Judges have erroneously disregarded the

volume of evidence adduced at the trial to establish the prescriptive title of the

2nd Defendants - Respondent - Petitioner for Lot No. 5A in the Preliminary Plan

No. 1307?

3. Whether the learned High Court Judges have erred in law [by setting aside a

part of the judgment more specifically in relation to Lot 5A in the preliminary

plan without assigning any valid reason?

At the commencement of the argument of both these appeals, the learned counsel appearing

for all parties in SC Appeal No. 181/ 2015 as well as SC Appeal No. 182/ 2015, agreed that

the Court can amalgamate the hearing of both these Appeals. They also agreed that it would

suffice for this Court to pronounce one composite judgment in respect of both these Appeals

because both these Appeals have emanated from one and the same judgment of the District

Court as well as one and the same judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. This

Court has accordingly taken steps to pronounce this judgment which would be applicable to

both SC Appeal No. 181/ 2015 as well as SC Appeal No. 182/ 2015.

The 3rd and 4th Defendants had jointly filed their Statement of Claim, praying that Lot No. 3

of Plan No. 1307 be excluded from the corpus to be partitioned, and Lot No. 2 of the said plan

be reserved as a roadway. The 4th Defendant is the wife of the 3rd Defendant. According to

their Statement of Claim, they have claimed prescriptive title to Lot 3 of Plan No. 1307.

The 2nd Defendant filing her Statement of Claim, has prayed that Lot No. 5 of Plan No. 1307

be excluded from the corpus to be partitioned on the basis that the 2nd Defendant has acquired

prescriptive title to that Lot. She had also claimed that Lot No. 2, be reserved as a roadway.

It is common ground that the Plaintiff had come to the land in the year 1988. Indeed, the

Plaintiff relies on Deed No. 1628 (produced marked P 7 in the District Court) by which he had

sold 2/3 undivided share of the whole land to his brother Kakulanda Liyanage Don Siripala

who is the 1st Defendant in the instant Partition Action. It is on that basis that the Plaintiff had

filed the instant Partition Action only against the 1st Defendant (brother of the Plaintiff).

[SC Appeal 181/ 2015 with 182/ 2015]

Page 15 of 21

At the outset, it must be observed that the evidence of the Plaintiff has clearly indicated that

the 3rd and 4th Defendants were also involved in some cultivation on the land. However, for

the reasons best known to him, the Plaintiff had not chosen to name those two persons as

defendants in his plaint. As mentioned above, the 3rd and 4th Defendants came into the case

only after the Preliminary Survey was conducted.

After the Plaintiff closed his case, both the 2nd Defendant and the 4th Defendant had given

evidence. The 2nd Defendant in her evidence had asserted that she was possessing this land

since 1968. She had categorically stated that she had been in possession of a portion of the

land, other than Lot 5A. According to her evidence, the 1st Defendant (Kakulanda Liyanage

Don Siripala) had come to this area somewhere in 1987. The Plaintiff also in his evidence, had

admitted that he came to this land at a later stage. He has categorically stated under cross-

examination, that he came to reside in this area in the year 1988 and he was not residing

there before 1987.

It is the position of the Plaintiff that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants are persons who had

looked after this land when it was owned by Gnana Jayasinghe. This land was originally owned

by Albert Jayasinghe and after his demise, Gnana Jayasinghe who is the wife of said Albert

Jayasinghe came to be the owner of the land. It is the position taken up by the Plaintiff that

the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants came into the land as licensees of said Gnana Jayasinghe.

I observe that even according to the pedigree filed by the Plaintiff and according to the plaint,

the name of the owner of the land (by virtue of Deed No. 266 dated 09-12-1966) has been

mentioned as said Albert Jayasinghe. Kakulanda Liyanage Don Jayasena (the Plaintiff) had

acquired his title by virtue of Deed No. 1017 dated 10-05-1987 by purchasing it from the wife

(Gnana Jayasinghe) and the children of said deceased Albert Jayasinghe.

Contrary to the Plaintiff’s version of the case, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants in their evidence

had stated categorically that when they started possessing this land there was no known

owner to the land. They deny the position that they came in as licensees of Gnana Jayasinghe

(the previous owner). The evidence of the 3rd and 4th Defendants is that they started

cultivating this land which was a part of the jungle when they were young and newly married.

Thus, as far as the 3rd and 4th defendants are concerned, they have started possessing this

land as if they had owned the land.

The evidence of the plaintiff is that they had brought to the notice of Gnana Jayasinghe, the

fact that the defendants are forcibly cultivating the relevant land. The Plaintiff has also

[SC Appeal 181/ 2015 with 182/ 2015]

Page 16 of 21

stated in his evidence that, said Gnana Jayasinghe was angry hearing that information. This

could be gathered from the following piece of evidence of the Plaintiff.

Thus, the evidence of the Plaintiff itself has established before court that the nature of the

possession of the relevant land maintained and enjoyed by the defendants, was a

possession which was adverse to the interest of both the Plaintiff and Gnana Jayasinghe. In

view of the above, it is now not open for the plaintiff to argue in this appeal that the

Defendants had failed to prove the ingredient of adverse possession which is a requirement

under section 3 of Prescription Ordinance.

The Plaintiff has also called the then Grama Niladhari of the area (Gama Ethige Don Francis

Lambert) to give evidence on his behalf. I observe that even according to the evidence of

the said Grama Niladhari (Lambert), the Defendants had cultivated this land for a long time.

The following excerpts taken from the evidence given by the said Grama Niladhari (Lambert)

1 Page 103 of the Appeal Brief. 2 Page 104 of the Appeal Brief.

[SC Appeal 181/ 2015 with 182/ 2015]

Page 17 of 21

would also show that the 2nd , 3rd and the 4th Defendants from the very commencement of

their possession, had not recognized at any stage, the ownership of Gnana Jayasinghe.

Thus, it can be seen that the cumulative effect of the evidence of the Plaintiff supported by

the evidence given by Grama Niladhari Gama Ethige Don Francis Lambert is a clear

establishment before Court that the nature of the possession of the relevant land maintained

and enjoyed by the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th Defendants, was a possession which was adverse to

the interest of both the Plaintiff and Gnana Jayasinghe.

The fact that the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th Defendants are licensees of Gnana Jayasinghe, is a

position taken up by the Plaintiff. However, as has been mentioned earlier, there is no

evidence to substantiate this position. Thus, I have to go on the basis that they are not

licensees of Gnana Jayasinghe.

Thus, having regard to the totality of evidence adduced in this case, one would observe that

the possession of the relevant land by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants had continued adverse

to any interest Gnana Jayasinghe may have had at the beginning.

It is the Plaintiff who had come at a later stage and disturbed the possession of the 3rd and

4th Defendants. That act ended up with an order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of

Mathugama, in a case filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts procedure Act. The report

filed in the Magistrate’s Court by police in the said case, together with the order dated 18-02-

1992 pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Mathugama has been produced in the District

Court marked 2 V 10. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants had stood as parties in the Magistrate’s

Court, in that case. The learned Magistrate by order dated 18-02-1992, had ordered that the

3rd Defendant is entitled to continue to possess the land in terms of the provisions of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The filing of the said report in the Magistrate’s Court by police, had been triggered when the

1st Defendant had disturbed the peaceful possession of this land hitherto enjoyed by the 2nd

Defendant. It was the 2nd Defendant who had complained to police about the disturbance of

her peaceful possession on 30-09-1991.

The 4th Defendant in her evidence had stated that she along with her husband K.L. Sirisena

who stood as the original 3rd Defendant, was in possession of this land since 1968 along with

the 2nd Defendant who is the sister of the 3rd Defendant. The 4th Defendant has also stated

that there was no owner to this land when they started possessing it in 1968. The 4th

Defendant has also stated the same.

In addition to the above, a neighbour who was living close to the land, Siddi Haluge Saina

Fernando, had also given evidence on behalf of the Defendants. According to said Saina

Fernando’s evidence the 2nd and 3rd Defendants had been cultivating this land for a long period

of time. This neighbour Saina Fernando had been living in this locality for over 50 years.

Learned District Judge having considered all the evidence led in the case, for the reasons set

out in his judgment, had opted to accept the evidence of the 3rd and 4th Defendant and decided

to exclude Lot 3 and Lot 5A of the Plan No. 1307 from the corpus to be partitioned in this case

on the basis already set out in this judgment.

Having perused the judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals, I

observe that there is only one operative paragraph in that judgment which only deals with the

merits of the case. It is as follows,

“The learned District Judge has failed to consider that 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Defendants have acquired prescriptive title to lot 3 of the preliminary plan

marked as X at the trial. It is very important to note that 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Defendant- Respondents have not produced any acceptable document to prove

their possession. The documents marked by the Defendants are the police

complaint (2V1) and proceedings of 66 case and letter of administration. These

documents are insufficient to prove prescription”

In my view, this paragraph cannot be taken as giving any acceptable reason for setting aside

the conclusion arrived at by the learned District Judge who had analyzed the evidence in

detail.

In addition to the above, the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals in the middle paragraph of

page No. 3 of its judgment, had relied on the case of David Vs Gunawathie,7 which is found

to be not relevant to the facts of the instant case. This shows that the learned Judges of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals had confused themselves with regard to the applicable

law and the facts of the instant case. That itself is sufficient to set aside the judgment of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals.

Although it is by taking up the position that the 3rd and 4th Defendants are licensees of Gnana

Jayasinghe that the Plaintiff had sought to attack the case of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants,

the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff in that regard is totally hear-say evidence. This is

obviously so because the Plaintiff was admittedly not in this land before 1987. The Plaintiff

had neither listed Gnana Jayasinghe as a witness nor sought to establish the availability of

said Gnana Jayasinghe to give evidence in the case. On the other hand, as far as the

Defendants’ position is concerned, their possession of the relevant land had continued for a

long time adverse to the interests of Gnana Jayasinghe from the very beginning.

The learned District Judge has analyzed all relevant items of evidence produced before the

District Court before deciding to exclude Lot No. 3 and Lot No. 5A of Plan No. 1307 from the

corpus to be partitioned in the case. The learned District Judge has given reasons for his

conclusion. I agree with his reasoning. On the other hand, there is no basis either factual or

legal, for the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals to set aside the said well-considered

decision of the District Court. Therefore, I am unable to agree with the judgment pronounced

by the learned judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the questions of law in respect of which this court has

granted Leave to Appeal, in the affirmative. I proceed to set aside the judgment dated 10-07-

2013 pronounced by the High Court of Civil Appeals, and restore the judgment dated 30-01-

2006 pronounced by the District Court of Mathugama. The Appeal is allowed. The Appellants

are entitled to the costs in both courts.

As has already been mentioned above, this judgment must apply to both SC Appeal No. 181/

2015 as well as SC Appeal No. 182/ 2015.
