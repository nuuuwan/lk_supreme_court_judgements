"“When issues both of law and of fact arise in the same action, and the court"
"is of the opinion that the case may be disposed of on the issues of law only,"
"it  shall  try  those  issues  first,  and  for  that  purpose  may,  if  it  thinks  fit,"
"postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the issues of law have"
"been determined.”"
