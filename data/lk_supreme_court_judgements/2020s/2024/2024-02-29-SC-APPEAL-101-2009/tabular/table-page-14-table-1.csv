"complaint made by the appellant-company. Thus, it is apparent that the cause of action is based"
"on the appellant-company making a complaint to the Police against the respondent, and setting"
"the law in motion against the respondent which resulted in arresting and remanding him."
"Did the Court of Appeal fall into substantial error by completely ignoring the provisions"
"of Section 9 of the Prescription Ordinance?"
"Moreover, in terms of section 9 of the Prescription Ordinance, action for damages should be"
"filed within 2 years of the arrest. However, the alleged arrest and remanding of the respondent"
"had taken place on the 22nd of December, 1986 and he filed the action on the 27th of April,"
"2001. Hence, the alleged cause of action is ex facie time barred by a positive rule of law."
"However, the District Court and the Court of Appeal have held that, the cause of action pleaded"
"by the respondent is for damages arising from the delict of malicious prosecution and that the"
"prescriptive time period, should be calculated not from the date of arrest and remanding him,"
"but  from  the date  of acquittal  from  the Magistrates’ Court which was  the 7th of July,  1999."
"Hence, the action instituted on 27th of April, 2001 was within the two year prescriptive period"
"as  set  out  in  the  Prescription  Ordinance.  As  stated  above,  a  careful  consideration  of  the"
"averments in the plaint and particularly the issues raised at the trial shows that the District Court"
"and  the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  law  by  holding  that  the  cause  of  action  pleaded  by  the"
"respondent is the delict of Malicious Prosecution."
"In the circumstances, I set aside the judgments delivered by the learned District Judge dated"
"11th of June, 2003 and the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal dated 2nd of February, 2009"
"and answer the questions of law as follows;"
"“4. Did the Court of Appeal fall into substantial error by failing to consider that the “wrong"
"for redress of which an action was brought,” was the tort of abuse of process and not malicious"
"prosecution, on the Respondent’s own showing?”"
"Yes"
"14"
