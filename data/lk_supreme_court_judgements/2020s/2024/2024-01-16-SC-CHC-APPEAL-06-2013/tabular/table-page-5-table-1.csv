"The learned trial judge had followed the dicta in  Rev.Sumanatissa v Harry  [2009] 1 SLR 31"
"which followed Chandrawathie v Dharmaratne [2002] 1 SLR 43 in deciding whether to allow"
"the respondent’s application to restore proceedings or not.  The learned trial judge had observed"
"that  “  ‘reasonable  time’  and  ‘reasonable  grounds’  cannot  be  decided  on  rigid  standards  with"
"mathematical precision, but have to be decided upon the given facts and circumstances of each"
"individual case. The test is subjective as opposed to objective. It is purely a question of fact and"
"not law”."
