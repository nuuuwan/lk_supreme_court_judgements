Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ The plaintiff-petitioner-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) instituted action

in the Commercial High Court against the defendant-respondent-appellant (hereinafter referred

to as the appellant). Both the appellant and the respondent are limited liability companies. The

respondent who was an importer of food items had appointed the appellant as his clearing agent.

The appellant had agreed to perform all necessary duties subject to payment of his fees. The

respondent by the plaint dated 03rd October 2006 instituted action in the Commercial High Court

seeking judgment against the appellant in a sum of Rupees 1,588,300,390/- on the basis that the

appellant failed to discharge his duties with due care, due diligence and efficiently. The

respondent claimed that the abovementioned conduct of the appellant resulted in a customs

inquiry against the respondent over a consignment of sugar imported by him. The appellant by

his amended answer dated 27th June 2007 claimed, that he always acted on instructions of the

respondent and therefore prayed for the dismissal of action.

This action had been initially listed to be called to schedule for trial and thereafter had been

called in court on several occasions. However, action had been dismissed on the day it was listed

for trial as the respondent was absent and unrepresented. Several months thereafter the

respondent, having sought permission of court to revoke the proxy and appoint a new attorney,

filed papers to purge its default. The appellant objected to the said application. The court after

inquiry made an order setting aside its initial order of dismissal and restored the case. The

appellant, impugns the, last mentioned order of the Commercial High Court, by this appeal and

moves that the said order be set aside.

When this matter was mentioned in this Court on 20th September 2017 both parties were

represented by counsel and of consent, hearing had been scheduled for the 22nd March 2018. On

22nd March 2018, the learned counsel who marked appearance for the respondent on the previous

day informed the Court that he has no instructions from the respondent. When this matter came

up for argument on 03rd October 2018, the same counsel moved Court to release him from these

proceedings and the Court having granted the application directed the petitioner to re- issue

notices on the respondent. However, these notices issued on the respondent were returned with

the endorsement closed. Thereafter at several occasions notices were re-issued on the

3

respondent and the registered attorney. A representative of the company, the secretary of the

respondent who appeared before this Court, on notice, informed that they had not had any

communication with the respondent since 2015. Under these circumstances this Court decided to

take this matter up for argument in the absence of the unrepresented respondent.

The learned counsel for the appellant impugned the Order of the Commercial High Court dated

23rd February 2012. This Order sets aside its initial order of dismissal and allowed the

application of the respondent made under section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure Code to restore

the case. This decision is now impugned on the basis that the Commercial High Court erred in

granting relief to the respondent when the respondent failed to make the aforesaid application

within a reasonable time and to disclose reasonable grounds for the default.

The learned trial judge in the impugned Order had set out the sequence of events that ultimately

led to the initial order of dismissal made on 10th June 2008. The trial had been initially scheduled

for 31st March 2008 after all pleadings were complete. However due to an inadvertence, the case

had been called in open court on 03rd March 2008 for trial and neither party had been present.

The journal entry of 03rd March 2008 reads Parties are absent. No order. Thereafter, the case

had been called on 31st March 2008 but both parties had been absent. Again, this matter had been

called in open court on 14th May 2008 and had scheduled for trial on 10th June 2008, in the

absence of both parties. Finally, on 10th June 2008, the court had ordered that Plaintiff absent.

No appearance. plaint is dismissed without costs. It is twenty months, thereafter, on 11th

February 2010 the respondent made an application under Section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure

Code and moved court to set aside the aforesaid order of dismissal. This application was made

by way of a petition and an affidavit. The affidavit was sworn by a director of the respondent

company. This application was resisted by the appellant company. The Managing Director of the

appellant had sworn an affidavit along with the petition resisting the respondents application. /

An inquiry had been held by the trial court where the marketing manager and the director whose

affidavit was filed had testified on behalf of the respondent whilst no evidence had been

presented on behalf of the appellant.

Evidence of the Director who testified at the inquiry reveals that the initial owner of the

respondent company was one Nadarajah Sri Skandarajah. According to the evidence, this witness

said Sri Skandarajah had owned three other business establishments. In August 2006, said Sri

Skandarajah had disappeared. After an investigation by the Criminal Investigations Department

two accused had been indicted for the abduction and murder of him. According to this witness

after the said Sri Skandarajah disappeared, his wife left Sri Lanka to join with their daughter who

was studying in Australia, at that time. Therefore, there had been no one to look after the affairs

of the respondent company. However, after this witness became a director on 15th January 2009,

he had initially taken necessary steps to obtain a death certificate of the deceased Sri

Skandarajah, who died intestate, from the District Court and thereafter had to attend to the affairs

of the deceased person's estate including the affairs of the companies. According to this witness

he had encountered many difficulties to locate the attorney-at-law who was retained to appear in

the Commercial High Court when the proceedings were instituted in 2006 and with great

difficulty had managed to obtain papers to revoke his proxy and obtain assistance of a legal firm

to restore the case, that had been dismissed in 2008. This witness had admitted that no steps to

restore the case had been taken between 2008 and 2009. He had reasoned out this lapse on the

basis that no director was present in Sri Lanka who had the capacity to take any meaningful

action, as the sole director had proceeded to Australia after her husband was abducted in August

2006.

The learned trial judge had given his mind to the evidence of the above witness in determining

whether the court should allow the application of the respondent dated 11th February 2010, to

vacate the order of dismissal and restore the case.

Section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure Code reads:

The plaintiff may apply within a reasonable time from the date of dismissal, by way of petition

supported by affidavit, to have the dismissal set aside, and if on the hearing of such application,

of which the defendant shall be given notice, the court is satisfied that there were reasonable

grounds for the non-appearance of the plaintiff, the court shall make order setting aside the

dismissal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for

proceeding with the action as from the stage at which the dismissal for default was made

5

The learned trial judge had followed the dicta in Rev.Sumanatissa v Harry [2009] 1 SLR 31

which followed Chandrawathie v Dharmaratne [2002] 1 SLR 43 in deciding whether to allow

the respondents application to restore proceedings or not. The learned trial judge had observed

that reasonable time and reasonable grounds cannot be decided on rigid standards with

mathematical precision, but have to be decided upon the given facts and circumstances of each

individual case. The test is subjective as opposed to objective. It is purely a question of fact and

not law.

In my view, the learned trial judge had neither misdirected nor erred in law when he decided to

adopt the aforementioned criteria in determining the issue. Furthermore, the evidence as revealed

by the witness as described hereinbefore reflects that the learned trial judge did not err or

misdirect himself in facts too. I am of the view that there is no merit in this appeal. Hence the

appeal of the appellant is dismissed and the order of the learned trial judge dated 23rd February

2012 is affirmed.

The Commercial High Court is directed to give priority to the proceedings in HC (Civil)

224/2006/(1) and conclude proceedings expeditiously.
