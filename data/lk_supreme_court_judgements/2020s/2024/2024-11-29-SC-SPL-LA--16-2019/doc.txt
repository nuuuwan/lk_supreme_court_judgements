ARGUED ON: 22nd October 2024.

DECIDED ON: 29th November 2024.

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The instant Appeal emanates from a case which was initially filed in District Court Tangalle

bearing 2218/P. Judgment in the said case was delivered by the District Court on 27th

October 1998, and the Plaintiff-Appellant had Appeal against the same by Petition of

Appeal dated 21st December 1998.

As the Court of Appeal Case bearing No. 877/98 was pending pursuant to the said

Petition, the Court was informed on 07th July 2006 that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent

Upali Gunasekera had passed away months back. Following an application to substitute

the said deceased party, Palm Paradise Cabanas (Pvt) Limited of Goyambokke, Tangalle

was substituted and the caption was amended to reflect the same.

As apparent from the Court of Appeal Brief, on 31st July 2008, 2nd Defendant-Respondent

had given notice of cross-appeal under and in terms of Section 772(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

The Court of Appeal, having considered the Appeal as well as the Cross-Appeal, delivered

its judgment on 04th December 2018. The matter is now appealed to the Supreme Court

6

by way of Petition of Appeal dated 14th January 2019. The said Petition of Appeal indicates

Upali Gunasekara, who is now deceased, as the Petitioner. The Court perused the motion,

Petition of Appeal as well as the Affidavit thereto, and all carry the same of the 2nd

Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner as Upali Gunasekara.

It is also observed by the Court that subsequent correspondence carries the name of the

Petitioner as Palm Paradise Cabanas.

Mr. Navin Marapana, PC raised a preliminary objection to the effect that there is no proper

appeal before the Court for the Petition carries a name of a person who is not among the

living as the Petitioner. He contends that this Petition is bad in law and that it should be

dismissed in limine.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC submitted the same to be

a typographical error. He submitted several judgments to support the position that it is a

curable non-fatal defect. However, the Court is of the view that these precedents can be

distinguished from the case at hand.

One such judgment the learned Counsel cited was Jayasinghe v. Gnanawathie Menike

(1997) 3 Sri L.R. 410. In this case Jayasuriya, J. opined, on p. 416, that “…where a party to

transaction or the subject of a transaction, is actually and corporeally present, the calling of

either by a wrong name is immaterial, for praesentia corporis tollit erroneous nominis, et

veritas nominis tollit errorem demonstrationist [The presence of the body cures the error in

the name; the truth of the name cures an error in the description].” In this case, the caption

of the particular action had described one Gnanawathie Manike as “Gunawathie Manike”,

and the caption was subsequently amended to correct the error.

The learned President’s Counsel also submitted the case of Shammari v. Premier Airline

Agencies (Pvt) Ltd. (1998) 2 Sri L.R. 162. This case involves an application to amend the

caption containing a misnomer/misidentification and the disputes emanating therefrom.

7

He further cited Bank of Ceylon v. Vellaiyan Ramasamy (1986) 1 CALR 481, which has

been cited in Shammari v. Premier Airline Agencies (Pvt) Ltd. (Supra). It was held in

the Vellaiyan Case that a mistake could be corrected where the mistake was in the name,

description or designation of the defendant which does not mislead the parties on the

question of identity of the person intended to be sued. This case is very clearly not

applicable to the instant case for the instant case is not one concerned with the name,

description or designation of a defendant nor a question of identity of the person to be

sued.

We are of the view that the instant case is one entirely different to the cases cited by the

learned President Counsel appearing for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner. The

Petition of Appeal before this Court was filed in the name of a deceased person. He had

passed away in the early months of 2006. This Petition of Appeal was filed on 14th January

2019. Subsequent to the substitution of Palm Paradise Cabanas (Pvt) Limited of

Goyambokke, Tangalle as the 2nd Defendant-Respondent—in fact, well over two years

later—the 2nd Defendant-Respondent, had given notice of cross-appeal on 31st July 2008.

In spite of the active involvement of the said party in the proceedings before the Court of

Appeal, the Petition of Appeal before this Court was filed in deceased Gunasekara’s name.

Despite the error being such a patent one, no application was made to this Court by the

said party to cure the defect. In fact, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner has

covertly changed the caption in subsequent documents without seeking permission from

the Court. In doing so, the said party has acted in bad faith.

For the aforementioned reasons, the Court takes the view that the Preliminary Objection

should be upheld and the Petition should be dismissed in limine.

Petition dismissed.
