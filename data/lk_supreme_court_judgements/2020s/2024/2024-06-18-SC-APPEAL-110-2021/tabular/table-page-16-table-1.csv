"relationship.  Breaches  of 
this 
trust  can 
justify 
termination 
if 
the  employer 
loses"
"confidence in the employee's ability to perform their role faithfully. The principle of ""loss"
"of  confidence""  was  highlighted  as  a  valid  reason  for  termination,  given  the  fiduciary"
"nature of the employee's responsibilities."
"This position was upheld in the case of The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited"
"vs.  M.S.P.  Nanayakkara13,  and 
in 
the  recent 
judgment  of  Development  Services"
"(Guarantee)  Ltd  (SEEDS)  vs.  W.P.R.P.  Devanagala14.  Where  the  Deputy  District"
"Manager was terminated due to alleged negligence and financial misconduct involving"
"loan approvals, which led to significant financial losses for SEEDS. The Supreme Court"
"discussed the ""loss of confidence"" principle with reference to the principle of trust. This"
"court held that the position of a Deputy District Manager  is one of high responsibility,"
"requiring the person holding such a designation to work with diligence and consistency."
"It is observed that the Labour Tribunal and the High Court erred in law as it failed to"
"evaluate 
the  evidence  when  deciding  on  financial  misconduct,  on 
the  part  of 
the"
"Respondent.  There  was  no  appreciation  of  evidence  by  both  courts  in  considering  the"
"significance of trust and confidence placed in the position the respondent held and the"
"ever-present  fiduciary  duty  and  prudence  to  uphold  the  good  name  of  the  institution,"
"together which constitute the essence of such position of responsibility."
"In these circumstances I am of the view that on a balance of probability, the evidence"
"before us clearly establishes financial misconduct on the part of the Respondent resulting"
"in the loss of trust and confidence, justifying the termination of employment."
"Accordingly, I answer the questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 on which leave to appeal has"
"been granted in the affirmative. Since this Court is of the view that the termination of"
"employment is justified, the question of law No. 3 need not be answered."
