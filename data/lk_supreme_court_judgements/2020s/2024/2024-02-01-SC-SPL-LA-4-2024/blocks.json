The question of law identified in consultation with learned counsel in respect of which Special Leave to Appeal was granted is as follows: \u201cWhether in view of the material placed before the Court of Appeal and the applicable law, the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal and in particular the relief granted by the Court of Appeal are lawful?\u201d Upon the granting of Special Leave to Appeal, the Court inquired from learned counsel whether they wish to extend agreement to this Court to proceed to the hearing of this Appeal forthwith. Both learned counsel expressed agreement to that course of action. Accordingly, the Appeal was taken up for hearing. Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that document marked \u201cP25\u201d bears no relevance to the case of the Respondent - Petitioners promotion to the rank of Major General, as the policy contained therein has only prospective effect and therefore has no applicability in so far as the case of the Petitioner- Respondent is concerned. Thus, she submitted that the grants of a Writ of Certiorari quashing \u201cP 25\u201dwas illegal. The learned Senior State Counsel also submitted that the quashing of \u201cP 25\u201d by the Court of Appeal has given rise to far reaching and serious consequences, in so far the administration of the Sri Lanka Army is concerned. Learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Petitioner \u2013 Respondent agreed that the case of his client could and should have been disposed of by the Court of Appeal without quashing \u201cP25\u201d, as it has no bearing to the promotion or otherwise of the Petitioner- Respondent from the rank of Brigadier to Major General. On a consideration of the afore-stated submissions, this court is of the view that the quashing of \u201cP25\u201d by the issuance of a mandate in the nature of a",

SPL.LA. 4/24 Writ of Certiorari was inappropriate and unnecessary in the circumstances of this case, and it was not warranted in terms of the evidence placed with regard to the applicability of the impugned decision taken by the relevant officials of the Sri Lanka Army. Thus, the grant of the Writ of Certiorari quashing \u201c P25\u201d is illegal. In the circumstances, this Court makes order quashing the relief granted in favour the Petitioner- Respondent as contained in paragraph \u201ce\u201d of page 22 of the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, this Court makes further order that the policy contained in \u201cP25\u201d shall remain in force in an uninterrupted manner, as if it was not quashed by the Court of Appeal. Court also considered the legality of \u201cP21\u201d. Court observes that certain contents of \u201cP21\u201d are erroneous, as it contradicts the record relating to the past career of the Petitioner- Respondent in the Sri Lanka Army. In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Court of Appeal had a valid basis to quash \u201cP21\u201d by the issuance of a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari. However, Court observes that in addition to quashing of \u201cP21\u201d, the Court of Appeal has issued further relief by the issuance of a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents before the Court of Appeal who are the 1st and 2nd Respondent- Petitioners-Appellants before this Court, to nominate and or recommend the promotion of Petitioner - Respondent to the rank of Major General with effect from 1/1/2021. It is the view of this Court that the issuance of that mandate is inappropriate and unwarranted in the circumstances of this case, as it removes discretionally authority conferred on the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army to make an appropriate recommendation afresh to the Commander \u2013 in- Chief of the Armed Forces as regards the promotion or otherwise of the Respondent- Petitioner from the rank of Brigadier to that of a Major General. In the circumstances, the relief issued by the Court of Appeal in favour the Petitioner- Respondent as contained in paragraph \u201cc\u201d appearing at page 22 of the impugned judgment is set aside by this Court, and in the alternative, this Court directs that the 1st Appellant should forthwith in accordance",
