DECIDED ON : 15-05-2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the 2nd & 3rd Defendant-Appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 2nd & 3rd Defendants) and the submissions of the learned Counsel for

the PlaintiffRespondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) and concluded the

argument of this case.

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 3 of 9

The Plaintiff had filed the Plaint in the instant case against the three Defendants (mentioned in the

caption) praying for a judgment and decree against the Defendants, to recover from them jointly

and/or severally, a sum of Rs. 3,450,322.99, the interest accrued to that sum of money at the rate of

4% per month until the date of the Plaint and the legal interest thereon from the date of the decree,

until the aforesaid sum is paid in full to the Plaintiff.

The 1st Defendant was the principal applicant (Hirer) who applied to obtain a Hire Purchase facility

from the Plaintiff to purchase the Vehicle bearing No. WPKA-8900.

The 2nd and 3rd Defendants are the Guarantors who had signed the Agreement produced, marked P2

in that capacity.

Although, the Plaintiff has filed the Plaint naming all three Defendants, namely: the 1st Defendant who

is the principal borrower, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants who are Guarantors, the Plaintiff had not

proceeded against the 1st Defendant as the summons could not be served on the 1st Defendant even

after several attempts. However, the Plaintiff had proceeded with the trial against the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants.

The learned Commercial High Court judge by his judgment dated 28-10-2014, has granted reliefs

prayed for, in the Plaint against the 2nd and the 3rd Defendants.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 28-10-2014 pronounced by the Commercial High Court, the

2nd and 3rd Defendants have lodged the instant Appeal to this Court.

In the course of the hearing, the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants advanced only two

arguments. The first argument is that it is wrong for the Plaintiff to have proceeded with the trial only

against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, leaving out the 1st Defendant who was the Hirer (the principal

applicant for the facility).

The second argument is that the Statement of Accounts produced, marked P6 A does not reflect the

correct sum of money due to the Plaintiff on the relevant Agreement.

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 4 of 9

4

Let us now advert to the first argument. We observe that the Plaintiff has had a reason to leave out

the 1st Defendant and to proceed only against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. These reasons can be

gathered from the journal entry No. 02 and the journal entry No. 07 respectively at pages 14 and 18

of the Appeal Brief. Accordingly, it is clear that it has not been possible to trace the 1st Defendant to

serve summons on him.

This fact has been clearly recorded by the learned Commercial High Court Judge in the afore-stated

journal entries. We also observe that according to journal entry No. 07, the learned Commercial High

Court Judge has directed the parties to provide the correct address of the 1st Defendant, to enable

the Court to proceed against him. However, this attempt has not been successful.

Moreover, perusal of the Agreement produced marked P2 clearly shows that the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants who stood as Guarantors, had agreed to waive their rights and privileges as Guarantors

and fully agreed with the Plaintiffs (Owners) entitlement to sue the Hirer and Guarantors jointly

and/or severally. This is found in Clause 03 of the Agreement which is as follows:

3. In consideration of the Owners letting the Goods to the Hirer under this Agreement

upon the terms and conditions herein set out The Guarantors hereby :-

(a) jointly and severally guarantee to the Owners the due and regular and punctual

payment by the Hirer of all the monthly hiring rentals specified in Schedule III hereof

and the performance and observance by the Hirer of the several terms and conditions

herein.

(b) bind themselves jointly and severally to pay forthwith on demand all monies which may

become payable to the Owners hereunder whether by way of monthly rentals debt,

damage, interest, cost charges or otherwise however.

(c) agree that the Owners shall be entitled to sue the Hirer and Guarantors jointly and /

or severally or to sue the Guarantors or either of them only in the first instance before

recourse is had to the Hirer.

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 5 of 9

(d) bind themselves jointly and severally to pay forthwith on demand to the Owners the

amount of any judgement or decree that the Owners may obtain against the Hirer

under this Agreement.

(e) renounce the right to claim that the Hirer should be excussed in the first instance and

all other rights and privileges to which sureties are by law entitled.

(f) agree that each of the Guarantors is liable in all respects hereunder to the same extent

and in the same manner as the Hirer.

We observe that the learned Commercial High Court Judge has clearly adverted to the above

Agreement in his judgment.

Furthermore, we also observe that according to Clause 03 (f), the Guarantors have agreed that each

of them (the Guarantors) are liable in all respects to the same extent and in the same manner as the

Hirer.

Therefore, the Plaintiffs decision to proceed only against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, leaving out the

1st Defendant particularly in view of the above circumstances, is in accordance with the agreement of

the parties. In addition to the above, learned Counsel for the Appellant did not cite any Provision of

law when he submitted that it is wrong for the Plaintiff to have proceeded with this case only against

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, leaving out the 1st Defendant who was the Hirer.

Thus, we are convinced that the decision by the Plaintiff to proceed only against the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants, leaving out the 1st Defendant, has had a valid basis and is well within the Agreement P2.

Therefore, we decide to reject the first argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants.

Let us now advert to the second argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants. This is the argument relating to the Statement of Accounts and the said argument is that

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 6 of 9

6

the Statement of Accounts produced, marked P6 A does not reflect the correct sum of money due to

the Plaintiff on the relevant Agreement.

As far as this argument is concerned, it would suffice for us to state here, that the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants had neither objected to the Statement of Accounts produced, marked P6 A when it was

produced and marked in evidence nor objected to it at the closure of the Plaintiffs case. This is

manifest from pages 166 and 180 of the Appeal Brief. We clearly observe that the said document P6

A has been marked and read in evidence without any objection whatsoever.

Although, the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants sought to rely on the proceedings dated

19-03-2013 in which there is some objection recorded by the learned Commercial High Court Judge,

a closer look at the said proceeding reveals clearly that the said objection was raised only in relation

to the marking of some other copy (not the Statement of Accounts produced, marked P6 A) without

producing its original. In any case, this objection had been taken on the 19th March 2013 whereas the

Statement of Accounts marked P6 A had been produced in evidence on 26-02-2014. Therefore, the

objection on record relied upon by the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants is an objection

taken in relation to some other copy sought to be produced, almost about an year before the

Statement of Accounts marked P6 A was produced in evidence at which time there was no objection

raised by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants on record. Thus, we are unable to accept the submissions made

by the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants that they had objected to the Statement of

Accounts marked P6 A being produced in evidence relying on the proceedings dated 19-03-2013.

Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with tendering of documents in evidence in the course

of a trial. The explanation given at the end of that section would be relevant in this regard. It is as

follows:

Explanation to Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code.

If the opposing party does not, on the document being tendered in evidence object to its being

received, and if the document is not such as is forbidden by law to be received in evidence,

the court should admit it.

If, however, on the document being tendered the opposing party objects to its being admitted

in evidence, then commonly two questions arise for the court:-

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 7 of 9

7

Firstly, whether the document is authentic-in other words, is what the party tendering it

represents it to be; and

Secondly, whether, supposing it to be authentic, it constitutes legally admissible evidence as

against the party who is sought to be affected by it.

The latter question in general is matter of argument only, but the first must be supported by

such testimony as the party can adduce. If the court is of opinion that the testimony adduced

for this purpose, developed and tested by cross- examination, makes out a prima facie case

of authenticity and is further of opinion that the authentic document is evidence admissible

against the opposing party, then it should admit the document as before.

If, however, the court is satisfied that either of those questions must be answered in the

negative, then it should refuse to admit the document.

Whether the document is admitted or not it should be marked as soon as any witness makes

a statement with regard to it; and if not earlier marked on this account, it must, at least, be

marked when the court decides upon admitting it.

We see that the Statement of Accounts marked P6 A is not a document that is forbidden by law to

be received in evidence. Thus, in the absence of any objection by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, the

court should admit it.

We also note that this Court has repeatedly taken this view in the past too.

In the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another V. Jugolinija Boal East this Court had

held as follows:

If no objection is taken when at the close of a case documents are read in evidence they are

evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the cursus curiae of the original Civil Courts 1

Moreover, referring to the instance where such objection was raised in the appeal, this Court in that

Case stated as follows:

1 1981 (1) SLR 18 at page 24

[SC (CHC) APPEAL 12/2015] - Page 8 of 9

...It is too late now in appeal to object to its contents being accepted as evidence of facts 2

The following excerpt from the case of Balapitiya Gunananda Thero V. Talalle Methananda

Thero shows that this Court in that Case also had adopted the above dicta.

P5 is the other document relied on by the Plaintiff. P5 is a handbill printed by the Dayaka

Sabha giving notice of the robing ceremony of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The point of

relevance is that the Plaintiffs lay name appears first and the Defendants lay name appear

thereafter. Mr. Dissanayakes submission that the order in which the names are set out in P5

is an indication of the order in which the novices are to be robed seems to be well founded.

P5, however, was marked in evidence subject to proof and the District Court held that the

document was not proved, although P5 was read in evidence at the close of the Plaintiffs case

without objection. This finding of the District Court was reversed by the Court of Appeal on

the basis of the decision in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another V. Jugolinija - Boal East

[Supra]. In that case when P1 was marked in the course of the trial objection was taken but

when the case for the Plaintiff was closed reading in evidence P1, no objection was taken by

the opposing Counsel. Chief Justice Samarakoon, expressed himself in the following terms. If

no objection is taken when at the close of a case documents are read in evidence they are

evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the cursus curiae of the original courts. The

contents of P1 were therefore in evidence as to facts therein (vide section 457 of the

Administration of Justice Law No. 25 of 1975) and it is too late now in appeal to object to its

contents being accepted as evidence of facts. Mr. Seneviratne argued that the Court of Appeal

was in error in holding that P5 was a part of the evidence in the case because the learned

Chief Justice based his decision on the provisions of section 457 of the Administration of Justice

Law which was repealed many years ago. I do not agree. The cursus curiae of the original

courts (a matter on which the learned Chief Justice was eminently qualified to express an

opinion) is independent of the reference to the provisions of section 457 of the Administration

of Justice Law which appears in parenthesis. I accordingly hold that the ruling of the Court of

Appeal in regard to P5 is correct and P5 must be considered as part of the evidence in the

case.3

Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we hold that the document produced marked P6 A has been

lawfully admitted and read in evidence in the trial and hence can be acted upon by Court as it is lawful

evidence.

In addition to the above, the perusal of the proceedings with regard to the cross-examination of the

Plaintiffs witness by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants show us that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have failed

to raise any particular incorrectness in the said Statement of Accounts marked P6 A. We see that the

2nd and 3rd Defendants had been content only with making few suggestions to the Plaintiffs witnesses

which we observe have no factual or legal basis. Thus, those suggestions should remain as

suggestions rather than evidence.

Although the 2nd Defendant had given evidence, we observe that the 2nd Defendant in his evidence

also has not raised any specific incorrectness in the said Statement of Accounts (P6 A). Moreover,

considering the totality of the evidence adduced by the 2nd Defendant gives us the opinion that he, in

his evidence, has admitted his liability.

For the foregoing reasons, we see no merit in this appeal. We decide to dismiss this appeal. Appeal

is dismissed without costs.
