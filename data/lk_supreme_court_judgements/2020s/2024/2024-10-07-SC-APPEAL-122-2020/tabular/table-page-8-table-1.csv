"Ellenborough Dictum"
"In Rex v. Cochrane [1814 Gurneys Report 479] Lord Ellenborough held that:"
"""No person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct"
"or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him, but nevertheless, if he"
"refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case has been made out and"
"when it is in his own power to offer evidence, if such exist in explanation of"
"such suspicious circumstances, which would show them to be fallacious and"
"explicable consistently with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable"
"conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the conviction that the"
"evidence  so  suppressed  or  not  adduced  would  operate  adversely  to  his"
