"Upon a careful examination of the judgment of the learned trial judge, it is clear"
"that he does not state that the Appellant had not proved his innocence. In fact, he"
"has acknowledged at several places in the judgment (pages 53, 56, 59 and 62) that"
"the burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt is on the State."
"However, the learned trial judge (at page 58) after holding that the prosecution has"
"established  a  strong  prima  facie  case,  stated  that  in  these  circumstances,  the"
"burden  is  on  the  defence  to  prove  their  innocence.  This  is  the  only  place  in  the"
"judgment where such a statement has been made."
"Nevertheless, that comment must not  be  viewed in isolation detached from the"
"context of the whole judgment. The judgment must be considered as a whole. It"
"has  at  several  places  reiterated  that  the  burden  of  proving  the  case  beyond  a"
"reasonable  doubt  is  on  the  prosecution.  Thereafter,  the  learned  trial  judge  has"
"correctly applied the Ellenborough dictum to  the  facts and circumstances of the"
"case."
"Admittedly there is a reference to the Lucas principle by the learned trial judge. The"
"Lucas principle explains the circumstances in which a lie uttered in or outside Court"
"by an accused may provide corroboration against him.  As Lord Lane CJ held in R. v."
