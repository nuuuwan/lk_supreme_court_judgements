"Furthermore,  in  Kiri  Mahaththaya  and  Another  v.  Attorney-General  [(2020)  1"
"Sri.L.R. 10 at 21] Aluwihare J. held:"
"“An Accused would therefore only be entitled to relief if it is shown that the"
"irregularity complained of, had in fact prejudiced  the substantial rights of the"
"parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. A mere statement to that effect"
"would certainly not be sufficient, but it must be shown as to how the failure"
"of justice resulted ...”"
