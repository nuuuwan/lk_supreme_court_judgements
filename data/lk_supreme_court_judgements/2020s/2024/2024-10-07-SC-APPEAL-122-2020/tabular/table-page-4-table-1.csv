"At  the  conclusion  of  the  argument,  we  directed  the  parties  to  file  written"
"submissions covering the merits of the case as well to enable the Court to decide"
"the course of action to be taken in this case."
"The Court of Appeal held that the learned trial judge had stated that the Appellant"
"had not proved his innocence and that there is a reference to the Lucas principle"
"which has no applicability to the case. It is for these reasons that it was held that"
"the  judgment  of  the  High  Court  was  not  well-considered  and  in  violation  of  the"
"principles of a fair trial."
"The Case for the Prosecution"
"At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence of four witnesses, PW1, PW2, PW4"
"and PW5 and marked several productions from P1 to P7, X1 to X5 and H1 to H6."
"PW1 was the investigating officer who had at the time of the raid, worked for about"
"8 to 9 years at the Police Narcotics Bureau (“PNB”). He was the OIC, PNB in 2001"
"when the detection was made. He testified that on 20.12.2001 he was summoned"
"by the then Director, PNB and introduced to an informant and to get ready for a raid"
"in Makola. The informant said that drug dealers were due to bring some drugs to"
"the Kesel Pandura junction between 16.30 and 17.30."
"He  thereafter  got  a  team  of  around  7  officers  ready,  inspected  them  and  their"
"weapons, the informant, and the jeep they were travelling in to check whether any"
"illegal substances were present. Thereafter, he proceeded to Kesel Pandura junction"
"with the team and the informant and parked the jeep away from the junction to"
"avoid any visibility."
