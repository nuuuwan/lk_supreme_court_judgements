"being  taken  away  to  record  a  statement.  On  the  way,  he  was  questioned  about"
"another person (“X”). Later he was taken to Maligawatte and then to a house in"
"Kolonnawa. A search of that house was done but nothing was recovered."
"Later he was taken to Modara and to the house of X about whom he was questioned"
"earlier. X was not at home. However, a parcel was recovered. Thereafter he was"
"brought to the PNB. He was again questioned about X. About two months later X"
"was arrested and remanded. He was in remand for about 4 months. Later he got"
"bail."
"In The Queen v. Kularatne and Two Others [71 N.L.R. 529 at 531] it was held that"
"when an unsworn statement is made by the accused from the dock, the jurors must"
"be informed that such statement must be looked upon as evidence, subject however"
"to  the  infirmity  that  the  accused  had  deliberately  refrained  from  giving  sworn"
"testimony. But the jury must also be directed that:"
"(a) if they believe the unsworn statement it must be acted upon,"
"(b) if it raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the prosecution,"
"the defence must succeed, and"
"(c) that it should not be used against another accused."
"The mother and the brother of the Appellant were called to testify on behalf of the"
"Appellant. The mother testified that the Appellant was arrested at home and that"
"the brother was not at home at that time. Only the Appellant, his father and the"
"witness  were  present.  Here  there  is  a  material  contradiction  between  the  dock"
"statement of the Appellant and the evidence of his mother. Even the brother of the"
"Appellant  in  his  evidence  stated  that  he  was  not  there  when  the  Appellant  was"
