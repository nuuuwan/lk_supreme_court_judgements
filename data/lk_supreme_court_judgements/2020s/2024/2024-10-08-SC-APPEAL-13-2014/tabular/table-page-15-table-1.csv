"The  1908  Addis  case,  was  considered  the  leading  authority  for  the  proposition  that"
"damages  are  not  recoverable  in  contract  for  loss  of  reputation.  In  the  said  case,  where  the"
"plaintiff  sued  for  compensation  for  loss  of  reputation  for  wrongful  dismissal,  the  House  of"
"Lords  held  that  the  plaintiff  should  not  be  compensated  for  any  loss  of  his  reputation  and"
"compensation should be limited, instead to his direct and pecuniary loss. Thus, the real ratio in"
"the said case was that damages for breach of contract per se are awarded only for loss caused"
"by breach of contract and not for loss caused by the ‘circumstances or manner of the breach’."
"Hence, if a party is able to establish financial loss was caused by the injury to reputation,"
"the  courts  in  England  and  Wales  have  granted  relief.  In  Aerial  Advertising  case  (Supra)"
"Atkinson, J., stated that he was ‘not giving damages for injury to reputation and that type of"
"thing’  but  that  the  damages  were  rather  ‘in  respect  of  the  pecuniary  loss  which  had  been"
"suffered.’"
"In  the  said  Aerial  advertising  case  the  plaintiffs  were  to  advertise  the  defendant’s"
"products under contract,  by flying over two cities towing a streamer. The Plaintiffs flew on"
"Armistice Day, when two minutes silence was observed and  it had the opposite effect.  The"
"public  disapproved  of  it  and  boycotted  the  defendant’s  products.  The  defendant  refused  to"
"honour the contract. The plaintiff sued for the contract price. The defendant counter claimed"
"for damages for breach of contract for the said loss and succeeded. Atkinson, J., in the said"
"circumstances observed as above, and stated that damages is not for the injury to the reputation"
"but for the pecuniary loss suffered."
"The Groom v. Crocker case (Supra) is in respect of the plaintiff being adjudged guilty"
"of  negligent  driving  as  a  result  of  the  defendant  solicitor’s  actions.  The  plaintiff  sued  the"
"defendant for injury caused to his reputation as a careful driver and it was held that no damages"
"can be recovered as the loss did not result in a pecuniary loss."
"From  the  foregoing  it  is  seen  that  the  courts  in  England  and  Wales  have  granted"
"damages, only when pecuniary loss ensues. Hence, in order to obtain relief for loss of reputation"
"it is sine-qua-non that a pecuniary loss is established."
"With regard to the House of Lords decision in Malik v. BCCI and Mohamed v. BCCI"
"(Supra) it is observed that Lord Steyn’s opinion was that damages are recoverable for a breach"
"of contract, which occurred therein, since there was an implied contractual obligation on the"
"part of the bank, not to run a ‘corrupt and dishonest business’."
"This case was in relation to the claims for ‘stigma damages’ by two employees of the"
"Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which collapsed and which in turn made"
"the two employees redundant. The claim of the two employees was based on the fact that by"
"operating  a  corrupt  and  dishonest  business,  the  bank  placed  the  employees  at  a  serious"
"disadvantage  in  finding  further  employment  in  the  financial  services  industry,  resulting  in"
"financial loss to them. Thus, in the said instance, the said two employees were compensated"
"not for the ‘manner’ of breach but for the breach of the contract itself, viz., breach of an implied"
"term of the bank to maintain trust and confidence. Lord Nichollas in his opinion, cautioned of"
"‘opening of flood gates’ and further opined, ‘that assessment of damages should be done on"
"the basis of ordinary contractual principles, subject to the question of causation, remoteness"
"and mitigation.’"
