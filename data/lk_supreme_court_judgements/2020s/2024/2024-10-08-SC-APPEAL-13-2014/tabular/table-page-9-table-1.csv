"and that the party producing the document must prove the contents therein, based on evidence"
"placed before court."
"Further, it was submitted that although the 2nd Plaintiff, the Chairman of the 1st Plaintiff"
"Company,  produced P 18, P  19 and P 20, that he did  not  give any  evidence relating to  the"
"inability to supply the fish referred to in P18 and P19 or the loss suffered by the Appellant as"
"a  result  of  being  unable  to  supply  the  fish  referred  to  in  P18  and  P19.    Similarly,  it  was"
"contented by the learned DSG that the 2nd Plaintiff failed to give evidence about the contents"
"or the factors referred to in P 20, the details of shipments dates, countries, number of boxes etc."
"Moreover, the 2nd Plaintiff admitted that P 20 was not a document prepared by him."
"Thus, it was the position of the learned DSG, that the Appellant failed to discharge the"
"burden of proof which lies on the Appellant. The DSG also submitted that a party in a civil"
"action seeking to establish ‘the contents of a document’ should, through independent evidence,"
"prove his case. The Appellant failed to prove the factors and content of P 18, P 19 and P 20."
"Therefore, the learned DSG argued that the Plaintiff failed to establish its case on a balance of"
"probability as required by law."
"Furthermore, it was the position of the DSG, that the trial judge failed to consider P 18,"
"P  19  and  P  20  vis-â-vis  the  photograph  album  P16,  which  he  submitted  was  conflicting"
"evidence  pertaining  to  the  time  line  of  repair  and  went  on  to  contend  that  when  there  is"
"conflicting evidence before court, the trial judge failed to consider and evaluate such evidence"
"on a balance of probability, and thus failed in its functions in discharging the burden of proof"
"bestowed on a judge."
"Having referred to the submissions of the Appellant relating to compensation/damages"
"for loss of profit, let me now move onto examine the Court of Appeal case of Cinemas Ltd v."
"Sounderarajan (Supra), the judicial precedent relied upon by the learned President’s Counsel."
"The  case  pertains  to  acceptance  of  a  certified  copy  of  a  certificate  of  heirship  in"
"succession issued by a revenue authority in a foreign country. At the trial, no objection was"
"raised  when  this  document  was  marked  and  produced.  At  the  appeal  however,  the  point  of"
"contention was that such certified copy of the certificate cannot be accepted as evidence, in"
"view of the provisions of Section 78(6)(ii) of the Evidence Ordinance. The learned judge of the"
"Court of Appeal having analyzed the provisions of Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code"
"and  specifically  the  ‘explanations’  referred  to  therein,  opined  that  admissibility  of  such"
"document cannot be raised for the first time in appeal and if a document is not objected to by"
"the opposing party, the judge must admit the document, unless it is forbidden by law."
"The principle and rational behind this rule as held in the Cinemas case is that, had an"
"objection  been  taken,  the  party  proposing  to  adduce  the  document  would  have  tendered  to"
"court, evidence aliunde and by the failure to raise an objection, the opposing party has waived"
"its right to object to such document as the opportunity for the proposing party to tender evidence"
"aliunde has lapsed and no longer available."
"There is no doubt that the principle laid down in the above case is sound and good law."
"But the question that requires an answer from this Court is, should a mere non-objection to"
"producing a document at a trial, (in the instant case P18 and P19) envisage that the ‘contents"
"of the document’ be taken as proof of all factors referred to therein."
