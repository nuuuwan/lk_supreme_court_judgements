"deed, a field book or a bill of exchange. I re-iterate, that the Appellant should establish the loss"
"of profit through independent evidence. P18 and P19 would not suffice. Cogent evidence is"
"required to prove the loss of profit."
"Thus, I see merit in the proposition of the State that ‘he who asserts must prove’ or to"
"quote the latin term ‘Incumbit probatio qui dicit non qui negat’. In the given circumstances,"
"the compensation/damages for loss of profit should be pleaded and proved, individually and"
"independently, item by item. In my view, the Appellant has failed to prove and establish that"
"the sum of Rs. 4,620,600.00 was the loss of profit suffered by the Appellant for the relevant"
"period 1994 to 1997 and the said loss occurred entirely due to the steps taken by the State to"
"take back the possession of the Udawalawa facility."
"Hence, I agree with the submissions of the State, that in order to obtain relief from a"
"court of law, ‘he who asserts must prove’ his case. The Appellant should have proved that he"
"accepted the offer of the writer of P18 and P19 to supply the stated amount of ornamental fish"
"from the Udawalawa facility only; the said facility was fully geared to supply the ornamental"
"fish referred to therein during the stipulated time frame (which goes against the Appellant’s"
"own narration that the fingerlings need a one year gestation period to be ready for export); the"
"Appellant failed to honour the said agreement referred to in P18 and P19 which had a knock-"
"on effect  in  the  Appellant’s turnover and  anticipated profits;  such action resulted in  loss of"
"profit, exclusively in a sum of Rs. 4,620.600.00; all such losses were incurred manifestly due"
"to  the  acts  of  the  State,  to  evict  the  Appellant  and  take  back  the  Udawalawa  facility;  such"
"actions  of  the  State  resulted  in  the  Appellant  to  abandon  the  project  and  to  vacate  the"
"Udawalawa  facility;  and  therefore,  the  State  is  liable  to  make  good,  the  said  loss  to  the"
"Appellant."
"Furthermore, in my view, the failure of the Respondent to challenge or object to the"
"documents P18 and P19 itself, cannot be considered as proof of P18 and P19 and the contents"
"therein  and  as  establishing  that  the  Appellant  suffered  a  loss  of  profit,  in  a  sum  of  Rs."
"4,620,600.00  and  such  loss  happened  entirely  due  to  the  acts  of  the  State  which  were"
"detrimental to the Appellant."
"In the aforesaid circumstances, I am of the view that, the Appellant has failed to prove"
"his assertions and the trial judge has erred in his findings. As discussed earlier, the High Court"
"reversed the findings of the trial judge for good and cogent reasons."
"Hence, I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned Judges of the High"
"Court.  The  High  Court  has  correctly  analysed  the  totality  of  the  evidence,  considered  and"
"examined  the  material  before  court  and  rightly  arrived  at  the  decision,  to  dismiss  the  State"
"Appeal, and to vary the sum awarded to the Appellant by the trial court under the limb, ‘loss"
"of profit’."
"Further, such analysis by the High Court, cannot be considered as propping up evidence"
"and infirmities of the trial court, as adverted to by the Appellant in his submissions made to"
"Court.  Adversarial  systems  of  law  as  ours,  permit  the  appellate  courts,  to  examine  the"
"significance of the evidence, led at the trial to ascertain whether the trial court has diligently"
"decided on the issues before court to come to a proper finding."
"Moreover,  the  learned  Judges  rightly  referred  to  the  ratio  of  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"judgement,  in  the  case  of  Seabridge  Shipping  Ltd.  v.  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation"
