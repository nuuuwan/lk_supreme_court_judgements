"It is further, noted that the relief sought by the Appellant is to uphold the judgement of"
"the District Court. As discussed earlier, the Plaintiff by its plaint moved for damages under"
"three limbs, viz., incurred costs, loss of profit, and loss of reputation."
"The District Court awarded damages to the Plaintiff under all three limbs. However, it"
"limited the damages for incurred costs, and granted the total sum prayed for under limbs (ii)"
"and (iii)."
"The High Court upheld the damages granted by the District Court for incurred costs but"
"disallowed the damages granted for loss of profit and loss of good will and reputation."
"Thus, by this Appeal, the only challenge is to the non-awarding of the damages for the"
"loss of profit and the loss of reputation of the Appellant."
