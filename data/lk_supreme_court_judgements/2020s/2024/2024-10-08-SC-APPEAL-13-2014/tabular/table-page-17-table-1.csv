"not  proved  any  actual  or  special  damages.  Thus,  the  court  varied  the  quantum  of  damages"
"awarded by the trial court and awarded nominal damages for injury to reputation."
"From  the  analysis  of  the  English  cases  and  the  cases  from  our  own  jurisdiction,"
"including the Court of Appeal judgement in Seabridge case discussed earlier, there is no doubt,"
"that damages for reputational loss can be recovered only in instances in which the plaintiff can"
"prove that financial loss has occurred due to the injury."
"Moreover,  as  held  in  Malik  v.  BCCI  case  (Supra)  in  assessing  damages,  ordinary"
"contractual principles relating to causation, remoteness and mitigation should be followed."
"In the instant appeal, the trial judge awarded Three Million Rupees as damages for loss"
"of reputation without any evidence being led to establish that financial loss was caused due to"
"the alleged reputational loss. Moreover, the principles of causation, remoteness and mitigation"
"were furthest in the mind of the trial judge."
"The learned Judges of the High Court on the other hand, having meticulously analysed"
"the evidence led at the trial court, clearly and unambiguously held, that the Appellant failed to"
"establish that the acceptance of foreign orders P18 and P19 with the anticipation of enhanced"
"production based on the Udawalawa facility, could not have become a reality, as the evidence"
"of the Appellant itself indicated, it takes almost a year to expect production from that facility."
"Thus, the finding of the learned Judges of the High Court was that the eviction of the Appellant"
"from the facility, will have no bearing on the non-fulfillment of P18 and P19."
"Therefore, in the circumstances of this case and for reasons more fully dealt under loss"
"of profit arising upon P18 and P19, the High Court came to the finding that the trial judgeâ€™s"
"conclusion on the loss of reputation is erroneous and the Appellant failed to prove the quantum"
"of damages. Thus, the High Court went onto hold that the Appellant is not entitled to claim"
"damages for loss of reputation."
"I see no reason to interfere with the said finding of the High Court. The examination,"
"the  deliberation  and  the  analysis  pertaining  to  loss  of  repudiation  by  the  learned  Judges  is"
"clearly  in  line  with  the  law.  The  Appellant  has  failed  to  lead  any  evidence  whatsoever  to"
"establish that financial loss was caused to the reputation of the Appellant, in order to obtain"
"damages under the said limb."
"Hence, I answer the 2nd Question of Law raised before this Court, in the negative and"
"in favour of the Respondent."
"Furthermore, this Court is mindful, vide Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code that"
"a judgement should reveal the trial judges thought process. A mere order deciding the matter"
"in dispute not only prejudices the rights of the parties but whittles down the importance attached"
"to the judicial process  and it colours the decision as one of whim and fancy. [Ref.  Swarna"
"Latha  Gosh  v.  H.K.Banarjee  and  another  1969  AIR  1167  and  Warnakula  v.  Ramani"
"Jayawardena (Supra)]"
"The  3rd  Question  of  Law  is  an  extention  of  the  2nd  Question  of  Law.  For  reasons"
"discussed  earlier  in  this  judgement,  I  hold  that  the  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court  have"
"correctly  appreciated  and  analysed  the  Seabridge  case  and  came  to  the  finding  that  in  the"
"instant  matter,  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  lead  evidence  to  establish  that  financial  loss  was"
