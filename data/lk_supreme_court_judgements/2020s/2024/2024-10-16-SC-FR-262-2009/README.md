ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

Originally two Petitioners had filed the Fundamental Rights Petition

bearing No. SC FR 262/2009 in which one could find twenty-three

Respondents named. It appears that the Court has concluded this case.

One could come to that conclusion because this case is no longer being

mentioned in open Court. This is an old case filed by the Petitioners over

two decades ago and the case records consist of many bulky volumes

containing a vast number of documents. Perusal of journal entries of the

[SC FR 262/2009 and SC FR 263/2009]

8

docket reveals that this Court had taken numerous steps to ensure the

repayment of the monies deposited by a vast number of depositors in the

collapsed finance companies. The original Petitioners who instituted these

cases have alleged in their Petitions that those transactions are fraudulent

on the part of the Directors and others managing/controlling those

companies.

The person who was cited as the 12th Respondent in both the above

Fundamental Rights Petitions, now filed a Petition dated 30.01.2024,

which was supported before us by the learned Presidents Counsel on his

behalf. It is remarkable, at the outset, to note that the 12th Respondent

who has filed the said Petition, has chosen not to give notice of whatever

the application he had intended to support before this Court through the

afore-said Petition and the nature of reliefs prayed for, either to the

original Petitioners who had instituted these Petitions or to any other

Respondents except the 1st Respondent. A notice has been issued on the 1st

Respondent, which is the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.

Learned Senior DSG who represented the Monetary Board of Sri

Lanka strongly urged before us that the Petition filed by the 12th

Respondent-Petitioner on 30.01.2024 should be dismissed in limine. It was

submitted by the Senior DSG that the application of the 12th Respondent-

Petitioner is in effect making an attempt to vary the directions and orders

issued by this Court on these two applications and the Committee of

Chartered Accountants appointed on the orders of this Court, stated in its

report issued on 08.04.2024, inter alia any release of Directors assets

should only be considered after the payment to the investors/depositors.

[SC FR 262/2009 and SC FR 263/2009]

9

The 12th Respondent-Petitioner did not notice any of the original

Petitioners who invoked jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126 in

their applications. One of those original Petitioners, who learnt of the 12th

Respondent Petitioners application through a third party, strongly

objected to the consideration of the instant application on the basis that he

was neither named as a party to the application nor was given any notice

of the same. On that premise, learned Counsel moved this Court to dismiss

the application of the 12th Respondent-Petitioner in limne as the reliefs

sought, if granted, would be detrimental to his interests.

There is much merit in that submission. Be that as it may, let us also

consider the merits of the Petition dated 30.01.2024 filed by the 12th

Respondent-Petitioner.

The reliefs that were sought from this Court as per the prayer to the

said Petition, in verbatim are as follows:

a. That your Lordships Court be pleased to make order that no order in

this case prevents the Petitioner from withdrawing the monies in the

accounts as shown in the schedule annex hereto marked X2 and from

trading in the shares in the schedule X2 and from withdrawing the

pension as shown in the schedule marked X2 hereto;

b. That your Lordships Court makes order that the directions of the

Central Bank and/or the 1st Respondent-Respondent in documents

marked P5 and P6 are not consequent to any order made in this case;

[SC FR 262/2009 and SC FR 263/2009]

10

c. For such other and further relief; and

d. Costs.

On the face of it, we observe that the above prayers are rather

unusual. This is because the 12th Respondent-Petitioner requests this Court

to make an Order stating that there is no Order in this case to prevent him

from doing certain things that had been specified in prayer (a).

Prayer (b) is also no different except to the institution in respect of

the relief sought. This is because the 12th Respondent-Petitioner requests

this Court to make an Order that certain actions done by the Central Bank

of Sri Lanka and /or the 1st Respondent-Respondent, had been done not in

consequence to any Order made by this Court.

We are of the view that if there is any Order made by this Court, that

Order must stand on its own.

Admittedly, the 12th Respondent-Petitioner stands indicted before

the High Court of Kandy in Case No. H.C. 153/2011 as the 6th accused. The

indictment presented to the High Court by the Hon. Attorney General on

03.08.2011, contained 135 counts. That indictment was subsequently

amended, and the amended indictment presently contains 3806 counts. In

that amended indictment, it was alleged that the 12th Respondent-

Petitioner, along with others, had conspired to commit the offence of

cheating, punishable under Section 403 read with Sections 113B and 102 of

[SC FR 262/2009 and SC FR 263/2009]

11

the Penal Code. The charges appear to have alleged that the 12th

Respondent-Petitioner had conspired to defraud monies of the Depositors,

deceiving them to believe that the companies relevant to these alleged

fraudulent activities namely Ceylinco Shriram Capital Management

Services Company (Pvt.) Ltd., C. L. C. Asset Management (Pvt.) Ltd.,

Ceylinco Capital Investment Company (Pvt.) Ltd. would repay the monies

of the Depositors on demand. Admittedly, the High Court of Kandy had

not yet concluded this case.

The 12th Respondent-Petitioner has annexed some proceedings

pertaining to the said High Court case along with this Petition. It is

observed that on several occasions the High Court has postponed this case

on the applications of the Accused. It is important to note the ground that

was urged by the 12th Respondent-Petitioner before the trial Court, urging

it to grant a postponement of the trial against him. On 24.03.2014, the

learned Counsel who appeared in the High Court for the 6th accused (12th

Respondent-Petitioner) successfully persuaded the trial Court to grant a

postponement on the basis of the pendency of this Petition, SC FR

262/2009 in this Court, even though an order made in SCFR 191/2009

directing that High Court to proceed with the trial on day-to-day basis.

The 12th Respondent-Petitioner failed to convince this Court of the

existence of any valid reason upon which he became entitled either to

maintain this Petition dated 30.01.2024 or to support the same for the

reliefs prayed for in the said Petition. Therefore, this Court decides to

refuse the petition of the 12th Respondent-Petitioner dated 30.01.2024.

[SC FR 262/2009 and SC FR 263/2009]

12

Accordingly, the Petition filed by the 12th Respondent-Petitioner is

dismissed. This Order must apply to SC FR 263/2009.
