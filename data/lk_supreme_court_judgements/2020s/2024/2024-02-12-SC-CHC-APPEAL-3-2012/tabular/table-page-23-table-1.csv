"However,  immediately  underneath  the  said  entry  are  two  further"
"entries to the effect: “Term Loan 1” and “Term Loan 2”. When asked"
"to explain the three entries, Mr. Ned Gomez–Head of Operations of"
"the  Plaintiff-Bank,  in  his  evidence  stated  that  the  said  entry  “full"
"recovery  of 
the 
loan  granted”  was  not  made  pursuant 
to  any"
"physical  money  being  deposited  by  the  1st  Defendant  Company."
"Instead,  it  has  been  made  for  accounting  purposes  and  to  cross-"
"reflect  that  it  was  the  same  outstanding  amount  of  the  aforesaid"
"loan, that had been rescheduled as “Term Loan 1” and “Term Loan"
"II”. He also gave evidence that no cash was released with regard to"
"“Term  Loan  I”  and  “Term  Loan  II”.  All  these  clearly  indicate  that,"
"contrary 
to  what 
is  claimed  by 
the  2nd  Defendant, 
the  2001"
"arrangement  was  not  a  new 
loan.  What 
the  2nd  Defendant-"
"Appellant  attempts  to  characterize  as  a  ‘new  loan’  is  the  amount"
"which  the  1st  Defendant-Company  was  anyway  duty  bound  to"
"repay."
"Throughout trial, the two witnesses on behalf of the Plaintiff-Bank"
"have consistently maintained that no new loan was granted to the"
"1st  Defendant-Company  and 
that 
the  action  was 
instituted 
to"
"recover 
the 
outstanding  amount  with 
interests 
of 
the 
same"
"continuing loan."
"The  2nd  Defendant-Appellant’s  position  is  that  “Term  Loan  I”  and"
"“Term  Loan  II”  were  two  new  loans  granted  to  the  1st  Defendant-"
"Company and one for which the Plaintiff-Bank never obtained fresh"
"security.  It  would  be  difficult  to  believe  that,  in  the  circumstances"
"where there had been default and delay in paying the monies that"
"were  due,  the  Plaintiff-Bank  would  have  even  considered  making"
"the restructured banking facilities available without security of the"
"existing bank guarantee."
