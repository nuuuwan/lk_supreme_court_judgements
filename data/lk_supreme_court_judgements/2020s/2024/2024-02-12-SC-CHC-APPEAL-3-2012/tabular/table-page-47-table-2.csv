"Attorney-at-Law"
"V. Balasubramaniam"
"Manohary  Ramachandran  is  the  3rd  defendant.  V.  Balasubramaniam,"
"Attorney-at-Law,  is  not  the  Notary  Public  who  executed  the  Mortgage"
"Bond P4 but a different Attorney-at-Law."
"The  execution  of  the  Mortgage  Bond  P4  was  recorded  as  an admission"
"and therefore it was marked in evidence without any objection. The 3rd"
"defendant did not give evidence. The contents of the Mortgage Bond are"
"admitted facts."
"In that backdrop, the last argument is also not entitled to succeed."
"Case of the 4th-23rd defendants"
"Despite  the  agreements  between  the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants  to  sell  the"
"apartment  units  to  the  4th-23rd  defendants,  no  deeds  of  transfer  have"
"been executed up to now. There is a special procedure laid down in the"
"Apartment  Ownership  Law,  No.  11  of  1973,  as  amended,  regarding"
"registration of such deeds."
