"596, the Supreme Court of India held:"
"One of the essential requirements of ‘Novation’; as contemplated by"
"Section  62,  is  that  there  should  be  complete  substitution  of  a  new"
"contract  in  place  of  the  old.  It  is  in  that  situation  that  the  original"
"contract  need  not  be  performed.  Substitution  of  a  new  contract  in"
"place of the old contract which would have the effect of rescinding"
"or  completely  altering  the  terms  of  the  original  contract,  has  to  be"
"by  agreement  between  the  parties.  A  substituted  contract  should"
"rescind or alter or extinguish the previous contract."
