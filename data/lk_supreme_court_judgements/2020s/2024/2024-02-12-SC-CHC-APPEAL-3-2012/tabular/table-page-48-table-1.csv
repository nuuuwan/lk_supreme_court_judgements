 SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012"
"Although  these  defendants  may  have  a  cause  of  action  against  the  2nd"
"and  3rd  defendants,  they  do  not  have  a  cause  of  action  against  the"
"plaintiff bank."
"Far from granting reliefs, in my view, they should not have been added"
"as parties to the case (Weerapperuma v. De Silva (1958) 61 NLR 481)."
"The 4th-23rd defendants also state that the 2nd and 3rd defendants have"
"not waived the privilege of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis belonging"
"to  them  in  law  as  guarantors,  and  that  there  is  a  novation  of  the"
"original 
loan  agreement  and  therefore  the  plaintiff 
is  disentitled  to"
"enforce the Mortgage Bond given as security for the original loan."
"I have already dealt with these two matters."
"The appeal of the 4th-23rd defendants must necessarily fail."
"Conclusion"
"The 
judgment  of 
the  Commercial  High  Court  of  Colombo  dated"
"26.08.2011  is  affirmed  and  the  appeals  of  the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants,"
"and the 4th-23rd defendants are dismissed."
"The  attempt  by  the  bank  to  recover  the  dues  by  selling  the  mortgaged"
"property  by  parate  execution  in  terms  of  the  Recovery  of  Loans  by"
"Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, was unsuccessful due to"
"the  majority  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court 
in  Ramachandran  and"
"Others v. Hatton National Bank (supra) decided on 15.04.2005."
"It  is  after  the  said  decision,  the  plaintiff  bank  filed  this  hypothecary"
"action  on  22.06.2006  to  recover  the  dues  to  the  bank  by  selling  the"
