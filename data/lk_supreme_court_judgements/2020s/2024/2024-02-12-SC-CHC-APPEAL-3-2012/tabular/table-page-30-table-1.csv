"Furmston’s Law of Contract (Oxford University Press, 16th edn 2012) at"
"652-653 in the following way:"
"Novation  is  a  transaction  by  which,  with  the  consent  of  all  the"
"parties  concerned,  a  new  contract  is  substituted  for  one  that  has"
"already been made. The new contract may be between the original"
"parties, such as where a written agreement is later incorporated in"
"a deed; or between different parties, such as where a new person"
"is  substituted  for  the  original  debtor  or  creditor…  Thus  novation,"
"unlike assignment, does not involve the transfer of any property at"
"all, for it comprises, (a) the annulment of one debt and then (b) the"
"creation of a substituted debt in its place."
