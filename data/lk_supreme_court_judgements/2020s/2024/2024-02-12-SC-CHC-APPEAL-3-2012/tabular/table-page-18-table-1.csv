"Revenue  [2012]  HCA  6,  Chief  Justice  French,  Justices  Crennan,  Kiefel"
"and Bell in the High Court of Australia held at para 12:"
"A novation, in its simplest sense, refers to a circumstance where a"
"new contract takes the place of the old [Olsson v. Dyson (1969) 120"
"CLR  365  at  389; 
[1969]  HCA  3]. 
It 
is  not  correct 
to  describe"
"novation as involving the succession of a third party to the rights of"
"the  purchaser  under  the  original  contract.  Under  the  common  law"
"such a description comes closer to the effect of a transfer of rights"
"by  way  of  assignment.  Nor  is  it  correct  to  describe  a  third  party"
"undertaking  the  obligations  of  the  purchaser  under  the  original"
"contract  as  a  novation.  The  effect  of  a  novation 
is  upon 
the"
"obligations  of  both  parties  to  the  original,  executory,  contract.  The"
"enquiry 
in  determining  whether 
there  has  been  a  novation 
is"
"whether it has been agreed that a new contract is to be substituted"
"for 
the  old  and 
the  obligations  of 
the  parties  under 
the  old"
"agreement are to be discharged."
