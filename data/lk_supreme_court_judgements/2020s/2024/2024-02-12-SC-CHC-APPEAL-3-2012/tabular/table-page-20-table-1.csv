 SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012"
"releasing 
the  sureties.  Wessels  –  paragraphs  2396,  2411  and"
"2415."
"Document V2A clearly indicates that the re-scheduled arrangement"
"was made at the request of the debtor, the 1st defendant. It merely"
"gave  him  extended  time  for  payment  and  a  concessionary  rate  of"
"interest  in  respect  of  the  balance  of  the  loan  remaining  unpaid  as"
"at  the  date  of  the  re-schedule  agreement.  It  did  not  bring  into"
"existence  anything  unfavourable  to  the  guarantors. 
In  fact,  the"
"concessions granted to the debtor were beneficial to the guarantors"
"as  well.  Condition  No  4  in  the  re-scheduled  agreement  preserves"
"the Bank’s rights to have recourse to the conditions of the original"
"agreement 
in 
the  event  of 
the 
failure  of 
the  debtor 
to  act 
in"
"accordance  with  the  conditions  of  the  re-scheduled  arrangement,"
"and  this  in  my  opinion  completely  negatives  any  intention  on  the"
"part of the Bank to make the re-scheduled arrangement to take the"
"place  of  a  new  contract  –  a  new  obligation  extinguishing 
the"
"existing  contract.  Further  the  absence  of  the  participation  of  the"
"guarantors for the re-scheduled agreement is significant. It is clear"
"evidence 
that 
the 
Bank 
considered 
that 
the 
re-scheduled"
"arrangement  was  an  arrangement  within  the  framework  of  the"
"existing contract and not in substitution therefor."
