"and 3rd defendants were not liable to pay anything to the Bank as"
"the  said  document  P2  had  become  invalid.  The  basis  upon  which"
"the  defendants  claimed  that  the  original  written  contract  P2  had"
"become invalid was that when the Bank re-scheduled the loan the"
"former  debt  was  extinguished  and  a  new  debt  created  by  the"
"rescheduled agreement V2A has come into existence and that this"
"new  contract  made  the  former  written  contract  unenforceable.  In"
"short, 
the 
contention 
of 
the  defendants  was 
that 
the  new"
"arrangement 
brought 
into 
existence 
by 
the 
re-scheduled"
"arrangement amounted to what is known to the law of contract as"
"‘novation’. This concept of novation, which is a part of the modern"
"law of contract, both English and the Roman Dutch, had its origins"
"in  the  Roman  Law.  To  put  it  in  the  simplest  possible  way,  in  the"
"modern  law,  ‘novation  occurs  whenever  an  existing  obligation  is"
"discharged in such a manner that another obligation is substituted"
"in  its  place.’  Wessels-Law  of  Contract  Vol  2,  2nd  Ed.,  1951,  page"
"658  para.  2369.  Novation  proper  takes  place  if  a  new  contract  to"
"take  the  place  of  the  old  is  established  between  the  same  parties"
"without  the  intervention  of  a  third  party.  When  this  happens,  the"
"later obligation extinguishes the former."
"The law presumes that once a contract is established, it retains its"
"binding force and that a creditor does not intend to renounce rights"
"which  he  has  acquired.  Hence  where  two  parties  to  a  contract"
"make  a  later  agreement,  the  law  will  presume  rather,  that  they"
"intended  both  agreements  to  have  equal  force  than  that  the  latter"
"should  supersede  the  former.  A  mere  change 
in  the  method  of"
"payment  does  not  affect  the  substance  of  the  contract,  though  it"
"may  affect  the  manner  of  its  execution.  Mere  extension  of  time  to"
"the debtor does not  affect  the substance of the obligation  and  will"
"therefore  not  be  construed  to  be  a  novation  having  the  effect  of"
