"Main argument of the 2nd and 3rd defendant mortgagors"
"Let me now consider the appeal of the 2nd and 3rd defendants."
"At  the  argument,  the  main, 
if  not  the  sole,  submission  of 
learned"
"counsel 
for 
the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants  was  based  on 
“novation”."
"Learned  counsel  admits  that  the  2nd  and  3rd  defendants  gave  security"
"for 
the  original 
loan  agreement  P3  dated  28.02.2001  entered 
into"
"between  the  plaintiff  bank  and  the  1st  defendant.  He  submits  that,"
"according 
to 
the 
loan 
ledger  marked  P8, 
the  original 
loan  of  Rs."
"30,000,000 
disbursed 
to 
the 
1st 
defendant 
on 
28.02.2001  was"
"rescheduled  on  30.12.2002,  and  on  the  same  day,  a  new  loan  of  Rs."
"34,099,341/12  was  granted  to  the  1st  defendant.  It  is  his  submission"
"that this is a novation of the original loan agreement and the 2nd and 3rd"
"defendants  did  not  agree  to  guarantee  this  new  loan  and  therefore  the"
"bank  is  not  entitled  to  recover  any  dues  arising  out  of  the  new  loan"
"using the security given for the original loan."
"Was there a novation of the original loan agreement?"
"In  order  to  decide  whether  there  is  a  “novation”  of  the  old  agreement,"
"the use of terms such as “rescheduling”, “restructuring”, “renewing” are"
"not  decisive.  The  transaction  is  determined  by  the  unique  facts  and"
"circumstances  of  each  individual  case,  not  by  the  labels  assigned  to  it"
"by the parties involved."
"Loan  rescheduling  typically  involves  modifying  payment  terms  without"
"altering  the  fundamental  conditions  of  the  existing  agreement.  This"
"adjustment may involve changes to the principal sum alone or both the"
"principal  and  interest,  along  with  other  payments.  The  primary  aim  of"
"rescheduling  is  to  afford  the  borrower  additional  time  for  repayment."
"The  rescheduling  of  an  existing  loan,  for  instance,  for  the  convenience"
"of  the  borrower  or  as  part  of  an  internal  bookkeeping  arrangement  to"
