"60. Under English law contractual rights may be transferred by an"
"assignment  of 
those 
rights.  An  assignment 
cannot,  however,"
"transfer 
contractual 
obligations.  Both 
contractual 
rights 
and"
"obligations  may  be  assumed  by  a  third  party  where  there  is  a"
"novation.  A  novation  involves  the  substitution  of  one  contracting"
"party by another with the consent of all parties. It does not involve"
"a  transfer  of  rights  and  liabilities  but  rather  the  discharge  of  the"
"original contract and its replacement with a new contract, typically"
"on the same terms but with a different counterparty: see generally"
"Chitty on Contracts, 33rd ed (2019), Vol 1, paras 19-087 - 19-090."
"61.  The  main  differences  between  assignment  and  novation  were"
"summarised  by  Aikens  J.  in  Argo  Fund  Ltd  v.  Essar  Steel  Ltd"
"[2005] EWHC 600 (Comm); [2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 56, at para 61"
"as follows:"
"“…there  are  four  main  differences.  First,  a  novation  requires  the"
"consent  of  all 
three  parties 
involved…But 
(in 
the  absence  of"
"restrictions)  an  assignor  can  assign  without  the  consent  of  either"
"assignee 
or 
the 
debtor. 
Secondly, 
a 
novation 
involves 
the"
"termination  of  one  contract  and  the  creation  of  a  new  one  in  its"
"place. 
In 
the 
case  of  an  assignment 
the  assignor’s  existing"
"contractual rights  are  transferred  to  the  assignee, but  the contract"
"remains the same and the assignor remains a party to it so far as"
"obligations are concerned. Thirdly, a novation involves the transfer"
"of  both  rights  and  obligations 
to 
the  new  party,  whereas  an"
"assignment  concerns  only 
the 
transfer  of 
rights,  although 
the"
"transferred 
rights  are  always 
‘subject 
to  equities’.  Lastly,  a"
"novation, involving the termination of a contract and the creation of"
"a new one, requires consideration in relation to both those acts; but"
