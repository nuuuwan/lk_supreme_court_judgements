Background

The plaintiff bank filed this action on 22.06.2006 in the Commercial

High Court of Colombo against the three defendants jointly and/or

severally (a) for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 46,829,186/72 together

with interest thereon at the rate of 23% per annum from 01.08.2005 till

payment is made in full, (b) an order that the land and buildings

described in the schedule to the plaint be bound and executable for the

payment of the said sum and interests with BTT, VAT and costs on the

footing of the Mortgage Bond marked P4, and (c) an order to pay the

said sum within two months of the date of the decree and in default of

such payment that the said mortgaged property be sold by public

auction to recover the dues to the plaintiff.

The 1st defendant is the principal debtor and the 2nd and 3rd defendants,

husband and wife respectively, are the mortgagors who mortgaged their

property described in the schedule to the plaint as a primary mortgage

8

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

to secure the loan disbursed to the 1st defendant. The mortgaged

property is an apartment complex located at No. 49, Collingwood Place,

Colombo 6.

It is the position of the 1st defendant that the 2nd and 3rd defendants

had previously obtained a loan from the plaintiff bank to construct an

apartment complex on the same property, mortgaging it as collateral.

They had defaulted in repayment, and subsequently, the mortgage was

redeemed with the assistance of the 1st defendant. He further states

that on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants, he agreed to be the

nominal borrower to obtain the loan facility relevant to this case from

the plaintiff bank.

According to the 1st defendant the beneficiaries of the loan were the 2nd

and 3rd defendant mortgagors and the plaintiff bank was fully aware of

it. This position seems to have been accepted by the 2nd and 3rd

defendants in paragraph 23 of their answer. By reiterating the

averments in the answer, the 2nd and 3rd defendants in their written

submissions state the 2nd and 3rd defendants deposited (in several

installments in the year 2001) a total sum of Rs. 7,500,000 with the

plaintiff and the plaintiff set off Rs. 175,000 (out of this amount paid by

the 2nd defendant) against the capital of the said loan; the plaintiff

allowed the 1st defendant to take Rs. 4,000,000 (out of this amount paid

by the 2nd defendant) and that the plaintiff has set off the balance (out of

this amount paid by the 2nd defendant) against the interest and tax and

stamp duty said to be due on the said loan. Unless the 2nd and 3rd

defendants were the beneficiaries of the loan disbursed to the 1st

defendant, payment of loan instalments to the bank is not expected

from an innocent mortgagor. No other explanation has been provided by

the 2nd and 3rd defendants for such conduct in the answer or by way of

9

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

evidence. The learned High Court Judge in the judgment has accepted

this position of the 1st defendant.

In the answer, the 2nd and 3rd defendants took up the position that (a)

the effect of renouncing the benefit of the senatus consultum velleianum

and authentica si qua mulier was never explained to the 3rd defendant

by an Attorney-at-Law as stated in the Mortgage Bond and (b) the 2nd

and 3rd defendants did not intentionally renounce the privilege of

excussionis, which they were entitled to as guarantors.

The 4th to 23rd defendants intervened in the action, claiming to be the

occupants of the units within the apartment complex constructed on

the mortgaged property. They allege that prior to the execution of the

Mortgage Bond, the 2nd and 3rd defendants collected full consideration

of the purchase price of all these units. Furthermore, they contend that,

having received these funds, the 2nd and 3rd defendants secretly

mortgaged the premises along with the building without their

knowledge, thus placing them in grave jeopardy. This, they argue,

amounts to a fraud committed on them.

In the answer, the 4th to 23rd defendants state that since the 1st

defendant is the principal debtor, the plaintiff bank should recover the

money from him, emphasising that the 1st defendant holds sufficient

deposits in the plaintiff bank for this purpose. They pray that the

Mortgage Bond be declared null and void and the plaintiffs action be

dismissed.

At the trial, the Chief Manager of the Colombo region of the plaintiff

bank gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff and tendered documents

marked P1 to P10. Except for the Mortgage Bond marked P4, which was

recorded as a formal admission, all other documents have been marked

subject to proof. The learned High Court Judge correctly noted in the

10

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

judgment that there was no necessity for further proof of these

documents.

I must pause for a while to state that merely because the opposing

counsel routinely says subject to proof whenever a document is

marked in evidence, it does not mean that all those documents must be

proved by calling witnesses. It is up to the Court to decide whether or

not a document marked subject to proof needs further proof. When a

counsel says a document shall be marked subject to proof, it is

necessary for him to state the basis of it, firstly, for the Court and the

party producing the document to seriously consider whether it is

necessary to call witnesses to prove the document and secondly, to

decide which aspect of the document (such as genuineness, contents,

date of receipt) requires further proof. Routine objections in general

terms for subject to proof as a matter of practice, which is one of the

main causes for the delay in concluding a trial, should be strongly

discouraged. With the pre-trial conference introduced by the Civil

Procedure (Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 2023 properly implemented, this

undesirable practice will hopefully cease to exist.

On behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants, no witnesses were called. The

2nd and 3rd defendants have marked D1 and D2 through the plaintiffs

witness.

Although several intervenient defendants have given evidence and

marked documents, as I will discuss later, they are irrelevant in

deciding the case.

The learned High Court Judge has entered judgment as prayed for in

the prayer to the plaint.

Appeals have been preferred by the 2nd and 3rd defendants, and the 4th-

23rd defendants.

11

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Main argument of the 2nd and 3rd defendant mortgagors

Let me now consider the appeal of the 2nd and 3rd defendants.

At the argument, the main, if not the sole, submission of learned

counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants was based on novation.

Learned counsel admits that the 2nd and 3rd defendants gave security

for the original loan agreement P3 dated 28.02.2001 entered into

between the plaintiff bank and the 1st defendant. He submits that,

according to the loan ledger marked P8, the original loan of Rs.

30,000,000 disbursed to the 1st defendant on 28.02.2001 was

rescheduled on 30.12.2002, and on the same day, a new loan of Rs.

34,099,341/12 was granted to the 1st defendant. It is his submission

that this is a novation of the original loan agreement and the 2nd and 3rd

defendants did not agree to guarantee this new loan and therefore the

bank is not entitled to recover any dues arising out of the new loan

using the security given for the original loan.

Was there a novation of the original loan agreement?

In order to decide whether there is a novation of the old agreement,

the use of terms such as rescheduling, restructuring, renewing are

not decisive. The transaction is determined by the unique facts and

circumstances of each individual case, not by the labels assigned to it

by the parties involved.

Loan rescheduling typically involves modifying payment terms without

altering the fundamental conditions of the existing agreement. This

adjustment may involve changes to the principal sum alone or both the

principal and interest, along with other payments. The primary aim of

rescheduling is to afford the borrower additional time for repayment.

The rescheduling of an existing loan, for instance, for the convenience

of the borrower or as part of an internal bookkeeping arrangement to

12

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

ensure conformity with standard accounting practices, does not ipso

facto give rise to a new loan agreement.

Conversely, novation replaces the old contract with an entirely new

one, fundamentally altering the terms and conditions and also perhaps

the parties involved.

The Blacks Law dictionary (11th edition) page 1281 defines novation

in the following manner:

1. The act of substituting for an old obligation a new one that either

replaces an existing obligation with a new obligation or replaces an

original party with a new party. A novation may substitute (1) a

new obligation between the same parties, (2) a new debtor, or (3) a

new creditor.

2. A contract that (1) immediately discharges either a previous

contractual duty or a duty to make compensation, (2) creates a new

contractual duty, and (3) includes as a party one who neither owed

the previous duty nor was entitled to its performance. A novation

rests on a contract, which must be clearly shown. It cannot be

made binding by later acquiescence or ratification without a new

consideration or the existence of facts that constitute an estoppel. If

the novation involves the original debtors discharge, it must be

contemporaneous with and must result from the consummation of

an arrangement with the new debtor.

As Prof. C.G. Weeramantry in his book, The Law of Contracts, Vol II,

page 718 states Where there is a novation of a contract, there comes into

existence in the eye of the law a new and independent contract. To

effectuate this, the intention of the parties to substitute the old contract

with the new contract must be unequivocally evident, avoiding

13

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

speculative interpretation, as such a transition entails serious legal

ramifications. Prof. Weeramantry at page 719 states:

A novation discharges not only the original obligation but all

obligations accessory to it. Interest, penal charges, suretyships and

pledges, accessory to the original contract, are thus all discharged.

In the words of Lord Moulton, in explaining the similar English

concept of accord and satisfaction by a substituted agreement,

No matter what were the respective rights of the parties inter se,

they are abandoned in consideration of the acceptance by all of a

new agreement. The consequence is that when such an accord and

satisfaction takes place, the prior rights of the parties are

extinguished. They have in fact been exchanged for the new rights;

and the new agreement becomes a new departure, and the rights

of all the parties are fully represented by it. [Palaniappa v.

Saminathan (1913) 17 NLR 56 at 58]

It is because of these serious repercussions, Prof. Weeramantry at page

720 states:

Novation is never presumed, for the law considers that a contract

once established retains its binding force, and that a creditor does

not intend to surrender the rights he has acquired under the earlier

contract. It follows that the law will incline to the view that a later

contract co-exists with, rather than supersedes, a former contract,

unless the court is satisfied of an intention on the part of the

parties to supersede and extinguish the earlier contract. [Voet

46.2.3; Wessels, s. 2396,2398; Karthikesu v. Ponnachchy (1911)14

NLR 486]

This does not however mean that there must be an express agreement

entered into between the parties for novation to take effect. A novation

14

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

can be inferred provided there is strong evidence that the parties

intended to replace the original contract with a new one. In Karthikesu

v. Ponnachchy (1911) 14 NLR 486 at 487, Chief Justice Lascelles stated:

Maasdorp (vol. IV., p. 165) states the law on this point as follows:

By our law differing in that respect from the Roman law, novatio

may take place, not only by express agreement, but also tacitly or

by implication, the consent of the parties to the novatio being

implied from the circumstances and the conduct of the parties. In

the latter event, however, the inference must be so probable and

conclusive as to make it quite clear that the parties intended to

recede from the original obligation and to replace it by another in

fact, it must be a necessary inference, the new obligation being

inconsistent and incompatible with the continued existence of the

original obligation.

The substitution of the original contract with a new contract as an

indispensable element of novation has been emphasised by the Courts

of other commonwealth jurisdictions as well.

In Kabab-Ji SAL v. Kout Food Group [2021] UKSC 48, the appellant

entered into a franchise development agreement with a Kuwait

company. Later, the Kuwait company became a subsidiary of the

respondent. A dispute arose under the franchise development

agreement, which the appellant referred to arbitration. The arbitration

was commenced against the respondent only, not against the Kuwait

company, on the basis that the respondent became a party to the

agreements by the novation of original agreements. The Supreme Court

of the United Kingdom was not inclined to accept this argument.

Making a distinction between novation and assignment it was held at

paras 60 and 61:

15

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

60. Under English law contractual rights may be transferred by an

assignment of those rights. An assignment cannot, however,

transfer contractual obligations. Both contractual rights and

obligations may be assumed by a third party where there is a

novation. A novation involves the substitution of one contracting

party by another with the consent of all parties. It does not involve

a transfer of rights and liabilities but rather the discharge of the

original contract and its replacement with a new contract, typically

on the same terms but with a different counterparty: see generally

Chitty on Contracts, 33rd ed (2019), Vol 1, paras 19-087 - 19-090.

61. The main differences between assignment and novation were

summarised by Aikens J. in Argo Fund Ltd v. Essar Steel Ltd

[2005] EWHC 600 (Comm); [2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 56, at para 61

as follows:

there are four main differences. First, a novation requires the

consent of all three parties involvedBut (in the absence of

restrictions) an assignor can assign without the consent of either

assignee or the debtor. Secondly, a novation involves the

termination of one contract and the creation of a new one in its

place. In the case of an assignment the assignors existing

contractual rights are transferred to the assignee, but the contract

remains the same and the assignor remains a party to it so far as

obligations are concerned. Thirdly, a novation involves the transfer

of both rights and obligations to the new party, whereas an

assignment concerns only the transfer of rights, although the

transferred rights are always subject to equities. Lastly, a

novation, involving the termination of a contract and the creation of

a new one, requires consideration in relation to both those acts; but

16

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

a legal assignment (at least), can be completed without the need for

consideration.

In a more recent case of Musst Holdings Ltd. v. Astra Asset Management

UK Ltd. & Another [2023] EWCA Civ 128 at para 82, Justice Falk states

that a variation of terms is not a novation.

A novation is not a variation. A varied contract remains in place. In

contrast, a novation is the replacement of a contract by a new

contract between different parties.

Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 reads as follows:

62. Effect of novation, rescission, and alteration of contract.If the

parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it, or to

rescind or alter it, the original contract, need not be performed.

Illustrations

(a) A owes money to B under a contract. It is agreed between A, B

and C that B shall thenceforth accept C as his debtor, instead of A.

The old debt of A to B is at an end, and a new debt from C to B has

been contracted.

(b) A owes B 10,000 rupees. A enters into an arrangement with B

and gives B a mortgage of his (As) estate for 5,000 rupees in place

of the debt of 10,000 rupees. This is a new contract and

extinguishes the old.

(c) A owes B 1,000 rupees under a contract. B owes C 1,000

rupees. B orders A to credit C with 1,000 rupees in his books, but C

does not assent to the arrangement. B still owes C 1,000 rupees,

and no new contract has been entered into.

17

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

This section underscores the necessity of having a complete

substitution of a new contract in place of the old with the assent of all

the parties as an essential prerequisite for the novation of a contract.

In Lata Construction v. Rameshchandra Ramniklal Shah [2000] 1 SCC

596, the Supreme Court of India held:

One of the essential requirements of Novation; as contemplated by

Section 62, is that there should be complete substitution of a new

contract in place of the old. It is in that situation that the original

contract need not be performed. Substitution of a new contract in

place of the old contract which would have the effect of rescinding

or completely altering the terms of the original contract, has to be

by agreement between the parties. A substituted contract should

rescind or alter or extinguish the previous contract.

In Ramdayal v. Maji Devdiji (AIR 1956 Raj 12) Justice Modi held at para

7:

62. If the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract

for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract need not be

performed.

A plain reading of this section shows that in order to have a

novation, the parties to a contract must agree to the extinguishment

or discharge of the old debt or obligation. There can be no novation

until this has been accomplished. A novation may take place by the

introduction of new parties or new terms into the contract. The test;

therefore, is what was the intention of the parties, or, in other

words, whether they intended to bring about a new or altered

contract between themselves.

18

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

In ALH Group Property Holdings Pty Ltd. v. Chief Commissioner of State

Revenue [2012] HCA 6, Chief Justice French, Justices Crennan, Kiefel

and Bell in the High Court of Australia held at para 12:

A novation, in its simplest sense, refers to a circumstance where a

new contract takes the place of the old [Olsson v. Dyson (1969) 120

CLR 365 at 389; [1969] HCA 3]. It is not correct to describe

novation as involving the succession of a third party to the rights of

the purchaser under the original contract. Under the common law

such a description comes closer to the effect of a transfer of rights

by way of assignment. Nor is it correct to describe a third party

undertaking the obligations of the purchaser under the original

contract as a novation. The effect of a novation is upon the

obligations of both parties to the original, executory, contract. The

enquiry in determining whether there has been a novation is

whether it has been agreed that a new contract is to be substituted

for the old and the obligations of the parties under the old

agreement are to be discharged.

In Ran Banda and Others v. Peoples Bank [2004] 2 Sri LR 31, the loan

was rescheduled by the bank with the agreement of the 1st defendant

debtor. When the bank took steps to recover the loan upon failure to

pay as agreed, the 1st defendant debtor and the 2nd and 3rd defendant

guarantors resisted it on the basis that novation of the old loan

agreement took place with the reschedulement of the old loan and the

bank cannot enforce the terms of the old loan agreement to recover the

dues of the new loan. This argument was rejected by the Court of

Appeal. Justice Amaratunga stated at pages 33-34:

The defendant-petitioners in their joint application and in their

affidavits took up the position that the Bank had no right to seek to

recover any sum of money upon the agreement P2 and that the 2nd

19

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

and 3rd defendants were not liable to pay anything to the Bank as

the said document P2 had become invalid. The basis upon which

the defendants claimed that the original written contract P2 had

become invalid was that when the Bank re-scheduled the loan the

former debt was extinguished and a new debt created by the

rescheduled agreement V2A has come into existence and that this

new contract made the former written contract unenforceable. In

short, the contention of the defendants was that the new

arrangement brought into existence by the re-scheduled

arrangement amounted to what is known to the law of contract as

novation. This concept of novation, which is a part of the modern

law of contract, both English and the Roman Dutch, had its origins

in the Roman Law. To put it in the simplest possible way, in the

modern law, novation occurs whenever an existing obligation is

discharged in such a manner that another obligation is substituted

in its place. Wessels-Law of Contract Vol 2, 2nd Ed., 1951, page

658 para. 2369. Novation proper takes place if a new contract to

take the place of the old is established between the same parties

without the intervention of a third party. When this happens, the

later obligation extinguishes the former.

The law presumes that once a contract is established, it retains its

binding force and that a creditor does not intend to renounce rights

which he has acquired. Hence where two parties to a contract

make a later agreement, the law will presume rather, that they

intended both agreements to have equal force than that the latter

should supersede the former. A mere change in the method of

payment does not affect the substance of the contract, though it

may affect the manner of its execution. Mere extension of time to

the debtor does not affect the substance of the obligation and will

therefore not be construed to be a novation having the effect of

20

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

releasing the sureties. Wessels paragraphs 2396, 2411 and

2415.

Document V2A clearly indicates that the re-scheduled arrangement

was made at the request of the debtor, the 1st defendant. It merely

gave him extended time for payment and a concessionary rate of

interest in respect of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid as

at the date of the re-schedule agreement. It did not bring into

existence anything unfavourable to the guarantors. In fact, the

concessions granted to the debtor were beneficial to the guarantors

as well. Condition No 4 in the re-scheduled agreement preserves

the Banks rights to have recourse to the conditions of the original

agreement in the event of the failure of the debtor to act in

accordance with the conditions of the re-scheduled arrangement,

and this in my opinion completely negatives any intention on the

part of the Bank to make the re-scheduled arrangement to take the

place of a new contract a new obligation extinguishing the

existing contract. Further the absence of the participation of the

guarantors for the re-scheduled agreement is significant. It is clear

evidence that the Bank considered that the re-scheduled

arrangement was an arrangement within the framework of the

existing contract and not in substitution therefor.

In Luxman Perera v. Union Bank of Colombo Ltd [2019] 2 Sri LR 395, the

1st respondent bank filed action in the Commercial High Court to

recover a sum of Rs. 5,162,341/53 and interest alleged to be due to it

from the 2nd respondent Company upon certain credit facilities which it

had granted to the 2nd respondent at the request of the appellant and

the 3rd respondent, who were the directors of the 2nd respondent. The

appellant and the 3rd respondent were also made defendants to the

action under a Joint and Several Personal Guarantee dated

21

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

16.03.1998, which they had signed at the time of granting the facility.

In the year 2000 the 2nd respondent went into arrears in making its

repayments, and at the request of another director, the 1st respondent

bank restructured the outstanding amount subject to the terms and

conditions of an offer letter, which was signed and accepted by the

appellant on 16.07.2001. The 2nd respondent continued to default on its

repayments, and in 2002 the bank sent several reminders followed by a

letter of demand. On 06.02.2007 the bank instituted legal action for the

recovery of the total amount outstanding and interest.

At the trial, the appellants defence was that in 2001 the 2nd respondent

Company did not reschedule the existing loan repayments but obtained

a new credit facility. The appellant argued that he only became a surety

for the 1998 loan, and not for the loan obtained in 2001, and the

Guarantee Bond having been executed in 1998, the claim for recovery of

money in respect of the same in 2007 was prescribed. It was also

argued that the 1998 guarantee bond was executed for a specific loan,

and could not be extended to cover future uncertain monies. The

Commercial High Court entered judgment in favour of the 1st

respondent bank and the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court dismissed this argument, despite the presence of

evidence that could suggest a novation of the prior loan agreement.

Justice Aluwihare reasoned out the said conclusion in the following

terms at pages 401-402:

There is no dispute that it was the abovementioned request letter

marked P6 that prompted the Plaintiff-Bank to send a new offer

letter in June 2001 marked P7. In the said letter the Plaintiff-Bank

has clearly indicated that We, the Union Bank of Colombo, are

pleased to restructure the outstanding pertaining to Emm Chem

(Pvt) Ltd on terms and conditions stipulated below. According to the

22

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

said letter, the outstanding amount was restructured as Term

Loan 1 and Term Loan 2. Even at the end of the letter P7, the

Plaintiff-Bank has stated Please note that this is the second re-

schedulement of the outstandings and therefore request you to

strictly adhere to the rescheduled payments.

It is also important to note that under the heading Security, the

Plaintiff-Bank has specifically referred to personal guarantee for

Rs. 7,000,000/= of Mr. Lakshman Perera and Mr. Surenthiran

together with net worth investments. The 2nd Defendant-Appellant

argued based on this reference that P7 was a new and distinct

loan which required a new personal guarantee. In contrast, the

Plaintiff-Bank claimed that it was not a request for fresh

guarantee but a cross-reference to the already existing guarantee

bond executed in 1998. I am inclined to believe that it was a cross-

reference, as it specifically refers to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

who were the sureties in the 1998 Guarantee Bond. If the Plaintiff-

Bank was requesting fresh guarantee, there would not have been

any necessity to specifically refer to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

names. The Plaintiff-Bank could have easily followed the

requirements in the Board Resolution marked P4 which only

requires the signature of any two directors of the Company.

Apart from these contentions, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant also

sought to argue that the 2001 facility was a new loan based on the

ledger accounts marked P12. In the said ledger account, there is

an entry to the effect full recovery of the loan granted. According

to the 2nd Defendant-Appellant, this entry proves that the 1998

loan had been fully repaid and nothing was remaining. If the 1998

loan was fully recovered, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant argued

that there could be no continuation of the same. Thus, the 2001

loan could only be construed as a new loan.

23

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

However, immediately underneath the said entry are two further

entries to the effect: Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2. When asked

to explain the three entries, Mr. Ned GomezHead of Operations of

the Plaintiff-Bank, in his evidence stated that the said entry full

recovery of the loan granted was not made pursuant to any

physical money being deposited by the 1st Defendant Company.

Instead, it has been made for accounting purposes and to cross-

reflect that it was the same outstanding amount of the aforesaid

loan, that had been rescheduled as Term Loan 1 and Term Loan

II. He also gave evidence that no cash was released with regard to

Term Loan I and Term Loan II. All these clearly indicate that,

contrary to what is claimed by the 2nd Defendant, the 2001

arrangement was not a new loan. What the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant attempts to characterize as a new loan is the amount

which the 1st Defendant-Company was anyway duty bound to

repay.

Throughout trial, the two witnesses on behalf of the Plaintiff-Bank

have consistently maintained that no new loan was granted to the

1st Defendant-Company and that the action was instituted to

recover the outstanding amount with interests of the same

continuing loan.

The 2nd Defendant-Appellants position is that Term Loan I and

Term Loan II were two new loans granted to the 1st Defendant-

Company and one for which the Plaintiff-Bank never obtained fresh

security. It would be difficult to believe that, in the circumstances

where there had been default and delay in paying the monies that

were due, the Plaintiff-Bank would have even considered making

the restructured banking facilities available without security of the

existing bank guarantee.

24

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

All these factors cumulatively indicate that there was only one

continuing loani.e. the loan obtained in 1998. It was the same

loan for which the 2nd Defendant-Appellant along with the 3rd

Defendant had signed a guarantee bond.

As previously noted, there shall be consensus ad idem (meeting of

minds) among contracting parties for novation to come into effect.

Chitty on Contracts, 33rd ed (2018), Vol 1, para 19-087 states:

Novation takes place where the two contracting parties agree that a

third, who also agrees, shall stand in the relation of either of them

to the other. There is a new contract and it is therefore essential

that the consent of all parties shall be obtained: in this necessity

for consent lies the most important difference between novation

and assignment.

In Musst Holdings Ltd v. Astra Asset Management UK Ltd (supra), the

Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom stated at para 56:

The consent of all parties is required for a novation. Consent can

either be provided expressly or can be inferred from conduct.

Whether consent has been provided is a question of fact. For

example, in Re Head [1894] 2 Ch 236 a transfer of funds from a

current to a deposit account following the death of a partner in a

banking partnership was held to amount to a novation of liability to

the surviving partner.

In Sri Lanka Co-operative Marketing Federation Ltd v. Ambewela

Livestock Co Ltd (SC/CHC/APPEAL/54/2007, SC Minutes of

27.03.2014), rejecting the plea of novation, Justice Ekanayake

observed:

25

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Further, it would be pertinent to note that it is only the description

of the name of the creditor that got changed but certainly not the

nature and character of the debt. More specifically, Lanka Milk

Foods (CWE) Limited has taken over only the operation and

management of the said Company (see P35). In order to prove

novation the defendant had to establish in evidence the intention of

the creditor to discharge the debtor from the obligation. In the case

before us, no such evidence was led at the trial. The express and

declared will of the creditor is required in order to constitute

novation. In this case the defendant has completely failed to

produce such evidence. In the circumstances, the defendant in this

case cannot avoid liability on the basis that there has been

novation.

In Attorney General v. Perera (1908) 12 NLR 161, the Supreme Court

held that the mere variation of terms in a contract does not constitute a

novation.

In Mohamedally v. Misso (1957) 56 NLR 370 it was held that the

execution of subsequent additional security on a promissory note does

not discharge any obligation unless the intention to provide substitute

security, as opposed to additional security, is clearly established. This

view was later upheld by the Privy Council in the appeal, Mohamedally

v. Misso (1957) 58 NLR 457.

I must refer to the judgment of Justice Suresh Chandra in Hatton

National Bank v. Rumeco Industries Ltd [2011] 2 BLR 329 which is often

relied upon by the guarantors on the question of reschedulement and

novation since those concepts are referred to in the judgment. In that

case, the plaintiff bank instituted action against three defendants to

recover the dues to the bank on a term loan given to the 1st defendant

in 1995. This loan was secured by two Mortgage Bonds. Ex-parte

26

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

judgment was entered against the 1st and 2nd defendants. Only the 3rd

defendant contested the case. At the inter-partes trial, contrary to the

pleadings, the bank presented a different case against the 3rd

defendant. The 3rd defendant is said to have given a personal guarantee

in 1992 regarding some previous loan, which had nothing to do with the

term loan given to the 1st defendant in 1995. The District Court, the

High Court and the Supreme Court were unanimous in holding that the

1995 loan was on a new term loan agreement and not a rescheduling of

the loan given to the 1st defendant in 1992 and therefore the personal

guarantee given by the 3rd defendant in respect of the 1992 loan cannot

be made use of to recover the dues arising out of 1995 term loan which

was secured by separate two Mortgage Bonds. These are unique facts

peculiar to that case.

The facts of the instant case are quite different. In the instant case,

there is no affirmative evidence for this Court to come to a definite

conclusion that the original loan agreement dated 28.02.2001 marked

P3 was replaced with a new loan agreement on 30.12.2002.

Let me quote the evidence which the 2nd and 3rd defendants rely on to

argue that there is a novation.

This is part of the cross-examination of the plaintiffs witness (the Chief

Manager of the Colombo region of the plaintiff bank) by the counsel for

the 2nd and 3rd defendants:

Q: Now answer my question. In the 5th column [of the loan ledger

marked P8] there is a heading balance outstanding on 30.12.2002,

there is balance outstanding NIL shown in the 5th column?

A. No, balance outstanding is Rs. 34, 099, 341.12.

Q. What does the NIL stand for?

27

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

A. The balance outstanding is Rs. 34, 099, 341.12.

Q. A word found in the same column just above that, there is a

word NIL?

A. There is an interim figure given for the day but it is not the end

of the balance.

Q. So, the balance outstanding is NIL because Rs. 29, 825, 000/00

is shown as recovered in column 4?

A. It is not recovery. It is a re-schedulement.

It is because of the use of the word reschedulement, the 2nd and 3rd

defendants say there is a novation.

Quoting the above evidence, learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

defendants states:

As admitted by the plaintiffs witness that this is a re-

schedulement. The said witness being a senior banker of HNB has

clearly used the word re-schedulement. This amounts to a

novation and the guarantors will be discharged.

This argument is unsustainable. As I stated previously, a

reschedulement of a loan does not necessarily amount to a novation of

the existing loan agreement. The term used in Luxman Pereras case

discussed above was restructuring, which is stronger than

rescheduling but the Supreme Court was not inclined to go by the

label given by the parties.

Although the loan ledger marked P8 indicates Nil in the 5th column

under the heading CAPITAL Balance O/s (Rs) on 30.12.2002, in the

28

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

last column on the same date under the heading TOTAL

OUTSTANDING (RS), it is stated 34,099,341.12.

The witness explained this in his evidence in the following manner.

Q. And on 30.12.2002, the balance outstanding is shown as Nil

and the same day it is thereafter made Rs. 34,099,341.12?

A. That is balance at the end of the day.

Q. Because the bank has given a loan for Rs. 34,099,341.12 and

then from that amount recovered the capital due from the original

loan of Rs. 30,000,000.00?

A. I do not agree.

Q. That is what is shown in the ledger called Loan Ledger Sheet?

A. The capital of Rs. 29,325 million plus the interest of Rs.

4,203,720 plus the charges of Rs. 70,620.38 was rescheduled and

capitalized. And a fresh loan of Rs. 34 million those are internal

book keeping arrangements. We capitalized the interest on the

request of the applicant. And that is how you can see it is a total of

these three items. Rs. 29,825,000, Rs. 4,203,720.74 and Rs.

70,620.38. It was accrued as charges at that particular date.

Q. And thereafter, the bank has charged interest on this fresh

loan?

A. The loan was capitalized. So the capital interest is charged.

Q. So, there is a fresh capital amount of Rs. 34,133,719.32 and

this case is based on that capital amount? Is that correct?

A. Yes.

29

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Q. I put it to you that you have already answered that this

mortgage bond was given to support the loan of Rs. 30 million set

out in the document marked P2?

A. Yes.

Q. So, now you are showing a different loan of Rs. 34,133,719.32

which came into existence on 30.12.2002?

A. I do not agree. I confirmed that is the same loan. It is a

continuation.

It was not a fresh loan given on 30.12.2002. It is an internal

bookkeeping arrangement whereby the capital outstanding, the

interest and the charges were rescheduled and capitalized on the same

terms as agreed upon in the original loan agreement P3. This has been

identified in the loan ledger P8 as Reschedulment entries pertaining to

the loan. It cannot be equalised to reschedulement of the loan with

new terms. According to the witness, it is a continuation of the original

loan agreement.

As seen from the loan ledger, both before and after rescheduling, the

total outstanding remains the same.

The entry showing a Nil balance did not result from an actual

payment to the bank. Furthermore, the notation of Rs. 34,133,719/32

under granted does not signify cash disbursement to the 1st defendant

on 30.12.2002. No money was given to the 1st defendant on that date or

any subsequent date.

If the contract was novated, the original debt should have been

substituted by a new debt as opposed to a mere continuation of the

original loan agreement. This is confirmed in Cheshire, Fifoot, and

30

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Furmstons Law of Contract (Oxford University Press, 16th edn 2012) at

652-653 in the following way:

Novation is a transaction by which, with the consent of all the

parties concerned, a new contract is substituted for one that has

already been made. The new contract may be between the original

parties, such as where a written agreement is later incorporated in

a deed; or between different parties, such as where a new person

is substituted for the original debtor or creditor Thus novation,

unlike assignment, does not involve the transfer of any property at

all, for it comprises, (a) the annulment of one debt and then (b) the

creation of a substituted debt in its place.

Chitty on Contracts, 33rd edn (2018), Vol 1, para 22-031 states:

Novation is a generic term which signifies: .that there being a

contract in existence, some new contract is substituted for it, either

between same parties (for that might be) or between different

parties; the consideration mutually being the discharge of the old

contract. (Scarf v. Jardine (1882) 7 App. Cas. 345, 351; The Tychy

(No.2) [2001] 1 Lloyds Rep. 10, 24)

If this internal bookkeeping arrangement or rescheduling is to be

considered as a new loan replacing the old loan as learned counsel for

the 2nd and 3rd defendants suggest, the new loan has been given to the

1st defendant without any security because the old loan given with

security could not be paid. This is unthinkable in the commercial world.

In Musst Holdings Ltd v. Astra Asset Management UK Ltd (supra) the

Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom held that a novation will only be

inferred from conduct if that inference is required to give business

efficacy to what happened. Justice Falk held at para 57:

31

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

However, a novation will only be inferred from conduct if that

inference is required to give business efficacy to what happened.

As Lightman J. explained in Evans v. SMG Television Ltd [2003]

EWHC 1423 (Ch) at [181]: The proper approach to deciding

whether a novation should be inferred is to decide whether that

inference is necessary to give business efficacy to what actually

happened (compare Miles v Clarke [1953] 1 WLR 537 at 540). The

inference is necessary for this purpose if the implication is required

to provide a lawful explanation or basis for the parties conduct.

Internal bookkeeping adjustments or rescheduling made for

convenience and clarity, without altering the conditions of the original

loan agreement, cannot be deemed as novation, thereby creating a new

contract. A mere change of method of payment or mere extension of

time to the debtor to make payment are not incidents of substantial

alteration that warrant the characterisation of novation or the creation

of a new contract.

I hold that the 2nd and 3rd defendants failed to establish that the

previous loan was settled and that a new loan with fresh terms

(excluding the Mortgage Bond P4) was granted on 30.12.2012, thereby

establishing a novation of the old loan agreement.

The plea of novation of the 2nd and 3rd defendants must fail.

Can the plea of novation be taken up for the first time in appeal?

It is admitted that the plea of novation was not taken up by the 2nd and

3rd defendants in the answer, did not raise as an issue at the outset of

the trial, did not raise as an issue during the course of the trial, and did

not state in the petition of appeal. It was raised for the first time at the

argument before this Court to be specific in the written submissions

filed after the matter was fixed for the argument. Can this be done?

32

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

A pure question of law can be raised for the first time in appeal but not

a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law (Ranaweera v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1965) 70 NLR 564 at 566,

Jayawickrema v. David Silva (1973) 76 NLR 427 at 430, Rev. Pallegama

Gnanarathana v. Rev. Galkiriyagama Soratha [1988] 1 Sri LR 99 at 120,

Candappa v. Ponnambalampillai [1993] 1 Sri LR 184 at 189,

Janashakthi Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Umbichy Ltd. [2007] 2 Sri LR 39 at 45,

Lebbai v. Mohamed Abiyar and Others [2021] 1 Sri LR 22).

As I held in Wijesinghe v. Wickramaratne (SC/APPEAL/154/2017, SC

Minutes of 21.11.2022):

A party to an action cannot change his position as he pleases to

suit the occasion. Firstly, a party cannot present by way of issues

a different case from what he has pleaded in his pleadings.

However, if the opposing party does not object, the Court can

accept the issues since once issues are raised, pleadings recede to

the background. Secondly, once issues are raised and accepted by

Court, a party cannot present a new case when leading evidence at

the trial from what he has raised by way of issues. Thirdly, once

the judgment is delivered by the trial Court, a party cannot present

a new case before the appellate Court from what was presented

before the trial Court, unless any new ground is on a pure question

of law and not on a question of fact or on a mixed question of fact

and law.

The plea of novation is not a pure question of law. It is a mixed question

of fact and law.

Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants, citing Somawathie v.

Wilmon [2010] 1 Sri LR 128 seems to suggest that there is no blanket

prohibition for a question of fact or mixed question of fact and law to be

33

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

raised for the first time in appeal. In Somawathies case, the High Court

set aside the judgment of the District Court on the basis that the deed

of gift the plaintiff relied on had not been accepted by the donee on the

face of the deed. The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High

Court and restored the judgment of the District Court on the basis that

whether the donee accepted the gift constitutes a question of both fact

and law, and thus cannot be raised for the first time in appeal. Justice

Bandaranayake (as Her Ladyship then was) stated at pages 135-136:

It was not disputed that no issue was raised on the non-

acceptance of the Deed of Gift. It is also to be noted that the

respondent had not contested the validity of the Deed of Gift as to

whether there was acceptance by the donees, at the time of the

trial in the District Court. Since no such issue was raised, the

District Court had not considered the said non-acceptance of the

Deed of Gift and therefore there was no material before the High

Court on the said issue. In the circumstances, the High Court was

in error when it considered the question of non-acceptance of the

Deed of Gift, which was at most a question of mixed law and fact.

In Musst Holdings Ltd v. Astra Asset Management UK Ltd (supra), the

Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom highlighted the role of the trial

Judge in deciding whether a novation can be inferred from the parties

conduct:

The question whether a novation can be inferred from the parties

conduct is a question of fact, with which this court will not lightly

interfere. The judge had the benefit, which we do not, of a

consideration of all the evidence. It is quite clear from his decision

that he took careful account of the evidence as a whole in reaching

his conclusions. This was not simply a question of looking at a few

emails and invoices and determining that they amounted to an

34

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

offer and acceptance. The judge explained that he was considering

the documents to which he referred in their context. As Musst

correctly emphasised, this was an evaluative exercise. The

comment made by David Richards LJ in UK Learning Academy v

Secretary of State for Education [2020] EWCA Civ 370 at [41] bears

repeating: As has been frequently said, the trial judge is in the

best position to assess the evidence not only because the judge

sees and hears the witnesses but also because the judge can set

the evidence on any particular issue in its overall context. This is

true also of an assessment of what a particular document would

convey to a reasonable reader in the position of the party who

received it, having regard to all that had preceded it.

The proposition that a question of fact can be raised for the first time in

appeal is mainly based on the old decision of the House of Lords in The

Tasmania (1890) 15 App. Cases 223 at 225 where Lord Herschell

stated:

It appears to me that under these circumstances, a Court of Appeal

ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put

forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that

it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as

completely as would have been the case if the controversy had

arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could

have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned, if an

opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the

witness box.

In the Supreme Court case of Appuhamy v. Nona (1912) 15 NLR 311 at

312, Justice Pereira raised some doubt about the acceptability of the

above position in the context of procedure we adopt in Sri Lanka where

a civil trial is conducted on identified issues. His Lordship stated that

35

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

the new point to be entertained in appeal it might have been put

forward in the Court below under some one or other of the issues

framed.

I am not sure that this ruling would apply to a system of procedure

in which the framing of issues at the trial is an essential step

except to the extent of admitting a new contention urged for the first

time in the Court of Appeal, which, though not taken at the trial, is

still admissible under some one or other of the issues framed.

Under our procedure all the contentious matter between the parties

to a civil suit is, so to say, focused in the issues of law and fact

framed. Whatever is not involved in the issues is to be taken as

admitted by one party or the other, and I do not think that under

our procedure it is open to a party to put forward a ground for the

first time in appeal unless it might have been put forward in the

Court below under some one or other of the issues framed, and

when such a ground, that is to say, a ground that might have been

put forward in the Court below, is put forward in appeal for the

first time, the cautions indicated in the case of the Tasmania may

well be observed.

Justice Pereira did not entertain the question of fact raised for the first

time in that appeal.

The cumulative effect of these two leading decisions (i.e. The Tasmania

and Appuhamy v. Nona) is that a question of fact can be raised for the

first time in appeal if:

(a) it might have been put forward in the Court below under some one

or other of the issues framed; and

(b) if it is satisfied beyond doubt that

36

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

(i) it [the appellate Court] has before it all the facts bearing

upon the new contention, as completely as would have been

the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and

(ii) no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by

those whose conduct is impugned, if an opportunity for

explanation had been afforded them when in the witness

box.

Later cases such as Arulampikai v. Thambu (1944) 45 NLR 457, Setha v.

Weerakoon (1948) 49 NLR 225, Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini

Senanayake [1992] 2 Sri LR 180 at 191, Somawathie v. Wilmon (supra)

followed the above two decisions.

In Leechman Co. Ltd v. Rangalle Consolidated [1981] 2 Sri LR 373,

Justice Soza stated at page 391:

Where the point depends upon a question of fact which is disputed

and should be determined on evidence, then it cannot be taken up

for the first time in appeal unless the facts necessary for the

determination appear in the evidence and are not in dispute at all.

The same approach was adopted by the apex Court of Australia in

Water Board v. Moustaka (1988) 62 ALJR 209 where Chief Justice

Mason and Justices Wilson, Brennan and Dawson, after a careful

consideration of precedent on the matter held at para 13:

More than once it has been held by this Court that a point cannot

be raised for the first time upon appeal when it could possibly have

been met by calling evidence below. Where all the facts have been

established beyond controversy or where the point is one of

construction or of law, then a court of appeal may find it expedient

and in the interests of justice to entertain the point, but otherwise

the rule is strictly applied.

37

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

As I stated previously, the question of novation or at least the question

of reschedulement which are not pure questions of law, were never

raised as issues in the trial Court. The 2nd and 3rd defendants do not

say that those questions could have been put forward under any of the

issues raised at the trial. I am not satisfied beyond doubt that this

Court has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as

completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at

the trial Court. The 2nd and 3rd defendants did not even attempt to

raise an issue on the question of novation at least during the course of

cross-examination. If such an issue was raised, I have no doubt that

the plaintiff bank would have led specific evidence to counter that

position. The 2nd and 3rd defendants cannot say that the proceedings

bear all the evidence which the bank could have led on novation, if the

question of novation was raised as a specific issue in the trial Court.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the question of novation

could not have been raised for the first time in appeal.

Peripheral arguments

Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants raised the following two

arguments as well:

(a) The 2nd and 3rd defendants did not renounce the benefit of the

beneficium ordinis seu excussionis.

(b) The renouncing the benefit of the senatus consultum velleianum

and the authentica si qua mulier was never explained to the 3rd

defendant.

Let me now consider them in brief.

38

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Beneficium ordinis seu excussionis

The beneficium ordinis seu excussionis is a privilege whereby a surety is

entitled to claim that as his liability is of an accessory character, it shall

not be enforced against him until the creditor has unsuccessfully

endeavoured to obtain satisfaction from the principal debtor.

(Wijeyewardene v. Jayawardene (1917) 19 NLR 449 at 452-453,

Wijeyewardene v. Jayawardene (1923) 24 NLR 336, Seneviratne v. State

Bank of India [2014] 1 Sri LR 320 at 333)

Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants, relying on this principle

argues that the plaintiff bank has no right to recover the dues from the

2nd and 3rd defendants without first taking all the steps to recover the

dues from the principal debtor, the 1st defendant.

This privilege is available to sureties under the common law. Roman-

Dutch law is considered as the common law of Sri Lanka because it is

the residuary law filling in the gaps only when the statute laws and

special laws are silent. The Mortgage Act, No. 6 of 1949, as amended,

being a statute enacted by the legislature would supersede any common

law principles pertaining to mortgage of properties.

As the long title of the Act indicates, it is an Act to amend and

consolidate law relating to mortgage. In Ramachandran and Others v.

Hatton National Bank [2006] 1 Sri LR 393 at 399, it was observed by

Chief Justice S.N. Silva that the Act itself is a piece of erudition. It takes

over the concept of Roman Law of Hypotheca whereby a real security is

created over property with the mortgagor remaining the owner in

possession of the property and provides a specific remedy to obtain an

order from Court declaring the mortgaged property to be bound

executable for the money due and for a judicial sale of the property. The

Mortgage Act prescribes both the substantive law and the procedure

39

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

relating to actions based on mortgage bonds and their enforcement

(Brunswick Exports Ltd. v. Hatton National Bank Ltd. [1999] 1 Sri LR

219 at 223).

According to section 4, Part II of the Mortgage Act containing sections 4-

62 is applicable to:

(a) a mortgage of land,

(b) to any action to enforce payment of the moneys due upon a

mortgage of land, and

(c) to any hypothecary action in respect of any land.

According to section 2, hypothecary action means an action to obtain

an order declaring the mortgaged property to be bound and executable for

the payment of the moneys due upon the mortgage and to enforce such

payment by a judicial sale of the mortgage property.

Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code enacts that every action shall

include the whole claim and if the plaintiff omits to do so (except with

the leave of the court obtained before the hearing), he shall not

afterwards sue for the remedy so omitted. It further states that for the

purpose of this section, an obligation and a collateral security for its

performance shall be deemed to constitute but one cause of action.

Section 7 of the Mortgage Act provides an exception to section 34 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

7(1). Notwithstanding anything in section 34 of the Civil Procedure

Code, a claim to enforce payment of the moneys due upon a

mortgage may be joined to a claim in a hypothecary action, or a

separate action may be brought in respect of each such remedy.

A close scrutiny of sections 2,4 and 7 referred to above reveals that

there are two actions available to a mortgagee. One is a hypothecary

40

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

action. The other is an action to claim recovery of the debt secured by

the mortgage. He can claim both in one action or file separate actions

for each. (Ahamado Muheyadin v. Thambiappah (1948) 51 NLR 392 at

395) In the instant case, the plaintiff bank has joined both claims in the

same action.

Section 46 of the Act is an important section.

46. No decree in any hypothecary action upon any mortgage of

land which is created after the coming into force of this section, and

no decree in any action for the recovery of any moneys due upon

any such mortgage, shall order any property, whatsoever, other

than the mortgaged property to be sold for the recovery of any

money found to be due under the mortgage, and no property

whatsoever, other than the mortgaged property, shall be sold or be

liable to be sold in execution of any such decree.

In this section action for the recovery of moneys due upon a

mortgage includes any action for the recovery of any debt secured

by a mortgage whether the cause of action sued upon arises by

reason of the mortgage or otherwise.

The two actions which the mortgagee could bring are highlighted in this

section as well: (a) any hypothecary action upon any mortgage of land,

and (b) any action for the recovery of any moneys due upon any such

mortgage. Thereafter it states no property whatsoever, other than the

mortgaged property, shall be sold or be liable to be sold in execution of

any such decree. The term any such decree covers both actions. In

the result, section 46 would apply even in an action against the

principal debtor as such action would be an action for the recovery of a

debt secured by a mortgage.

41

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Section 46 stipulates that a decree in a hypothecary action or any

action for the recovery of money due on the mortgage must be limited to

the mortgaged property. The prior position under Roman Dutch Law

was that the creditor was entitled to resort to the other property of the

mortgagor if there was a deficiency after the sale of the mortgaged

property (Wijesekera v. Rawal (1917) 20 NLR 126). The Mortgage Act

has thus introduced a statutory limitation on the liability of the

mortgagor.

In reference to section 46, in the Supreme Court case of Mercantile

Bank Ltd v. Anver (1976) 78 NLR 481, Justice Wijesundera held at 485:

The words used are no decreeshall order. They are emphatic

and the prohibition is unqualified. The result is only the mortgaged

land can be sold in default of payment whatever be the form of

action to recover the debt due on the mortgage.

Section 47 expressly removes any application of common law to the

above principle.

47. The provisions of section 46 shall have effect notwithstanding

anything in any other law or in any mortgage bond or other

instrument.

However, in terms of section 47A, the mortgagor can renounce the

benefit of section 46 thereby allowing the mortgagee to sale any

property of the mortgagor other than the mortgaged property to recover

the dues.

47A(1) Where at the time of the execution of a mortgage bond in

favour of a lending institution for the payment of a loan, the

principal of which exceeds one hundred and fifty thousand rupees

the mortgagor executes a separate instrument, attested by the

42

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

notary attesting the bond and by the witnesses to the bond

containing

(a) a special declaration on the part of the mortgagor that he

renounces the benefit of section 46 and that the effect of

such renunciation has been explained to him by the notary;

and

(b) an endorsement signed by the notary to the effect that he

has explained to the mortgagor the effect of such

renunciation, then, in addition to the mortgaged property,

any other property belonging to the mortgagor shall, subject

to the provisions of subsection(2), be liable to be ordered to

be sold and to be sold under the decree in an action upon the

mortgage, and the provisions of section 218 of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) shall, mutatis mutandis, apply

to the seizure and sale of such other property.

(2) In any case referred to in subsection (1), no process shall issue

for the seizure and sale of any property of the mortgagor, other

than the mortgaged property, until the mortgaged property is sold

and the proceeds thereof applied in satisfaction of the decree.

According to section 47A(3), it shall be the duty of the notary to explain

to the mortgagor, that the instrument provides for the renunciation of the

benefit of section 46 and that the effect of such renunciation is that, in

addition to the mortgaged property, other property of the mortgagor is

liable to be sold in execution of a decree in an action upon the mortgage.

In the instant action, when the plaintiff bank took steps to sell the

mortgaged property by parate execution in terms of the provisions of the

Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, the

2nd and 3rd defendants challenged it before the Supreme Court. The

decision of the Supreme Court is reported in Ramachandran and Others

43

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

v. Hatton National Bank (supra) where it was held by majority decision

that the bank cannot sell the mortgaged property by parate execution

since the 2nd and 3rd defendants are not the borrowers. The Supreme

Court at pages 399-400 referred to the Mortgage Act to state that

hypothecary action is the proper remedy. This hypothecary action was

filed in terms of the Mortgage Act in consequent to the above Supreme

Court judgment.

The Mortgage Act does not mandate that the Mortgage Bond cannot be

enforced against the mortgagor until the creditor (the bank, in this case)

has exhausted all efforts to obtain satisfaction from the principal

debtor. The common law benefits available to a surety/guarantor have

not been preserved.

A similar argument presented before this Court was rejected by the

majority decision in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Peoples

Bank (SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/09, SC Minutes of 17.03.2017) in respect

of two on demand Guarantee Bonds.

There was no condition contained in the Guarantee Bond that the

Peoples Bank should first demand from the principal before

demanding from the guarantor. When any party grants an

assurance to another party guaranteeing to pay on demand, it is

accepted that if the principal does not pay that the guarantor shall

pay. It is only on that assurance that the Bank grants the facility

which the principal requests from the Bank. That is the norm and

accepted practice in the business world. If any Bank takes it to

mean that it has to first demand from the principal, then file action

against the principal and then only the Bank can demand and file

action against the guarantor, there will be no bank who would

want to grant any facility to any principal on such a guarantee.

44

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Law of Guarantees by Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millet 2nd

Edition at page 192 reads as follows:

The fact that the obligations of the guarantor arise only when the

principal has defaulted in his obligations to the creditor does not

mean that the creditor has to demand payment from the principal

or from the surety, or give notice to the surety, before the creditor

can proceed against the surety.

At page 194 it reads as follows: There is no obligation on the part

of the creditor to commence proceedings against the principal,

whether criminal or civil, unless there is an express term in the

contract requiring him to do so

Similarly, in a mortgage bond there is no condition that the mortgagee

must first seek to obtain satisfaction from the debtor before bringing an

action against the mortgagor. Prima facie the mortgagors liability is

triggered on the default of the debtor.

Even if the creditor were to first bring an action against the principal

debtor, the Court by operation of section 46 would be precluded from

ordering the sale of any property of the principal debtor for the

satisfaction of the debt.

Section 46 clarifies the ambit of its application by specifying that

actions for the recovery of moneys due upon a mortgage includes any

action for the recovery of any debt secured by a mortgage. The intention

of the legislature is to limit actions on a mortgage bond to the

mortgaged property irrespective of whether the mortgagor is the debtor

or a surety/guarantor.

45

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Let me also state that the burden of proof in a hypothecary action is not

burdensome. In the Privy Council case of The Bank of Ceylon, Jaffna v.

Chelliahpillai (1962) 64 NLR 25, Lord Devlin stated at page 28:

The distinction between a claim to enforce payment of money due

on a mortgage and a claim in a hypothecary action is clearly drawn

in section 7 of the Mortgage Act, 1949, notwithstanding that by

that section the two claims may be joined. This action in relation to

the second and third paragraphs of the prayer is simply a

hypothecary action; and to succeed in it the plaintiff need prove

only the validity of the bond granting the land as security and the

existence of a debt so secured. How the debt was created is for this

purpose immaterial and the first bond is not therefore an essential

part of the cause of action. It can without being pleaded be

produced in evidence to prove the debt.

Accordingly, to succeed in a hypothecary action, the plaintiff need

prove only the validity of the bond granting the land as security and the

existence of a debt so secured. How the debt was created is for this

purpose immaterial.

Therefore, section 46 of the Mortgage Act must prevail over the principle

of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis in the event of a conflict as the

former is a statute and the latter is a principle in common law. This in

essence means that the mortgagors who stand as surety cannot claim

the benefit of this principle as section 46 the Mortgage Act allows the

creditors to sell the mortgaged property of a surety without first

proceeding against the principal debtor.

This may be one of the reasons why Chief Justice S.N. Silva in

Ramachandran and Others v. Hatton National Bank (supra) at page 399

stated:

46

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

I have to observe that the [Mortgage] Act itself is a piece of

erudition Although the Act contains several safeguards such as,

the registration of a lis pendens, intervention of any party having

interest in the land, being necessary in a proceeding that

culminates in the sale of property, there are also in-built measures

for expedition. If delays resulted in proceedings taken under the

Act that may have been due to a failure to understand the

provisions correctly and to implement them properly. It is my view

that the law itself should not be condemned for these inadequacies.

The 2nd and 3rd defendants cannot succeed on this argument.

Senatus consultum velleianum and authentica si qua mulier

In support of this Latin maxim, learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

defendants states:

Married women were prohibited under Married Womens Property

Ordinance from making contracts/securities for others without the

concurrence of their husbands under the law of thesawalamai.

It is the contention of learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants

that the effect of renouncing the benefit of the said maxim was never

explained to the 3rd defendant by an Attorney-at-Law although such a

clause is incorporated in the Mortgage Bond marked P4.

The 2nd and 3rd defendants have signed the Mortgage Bond at four

different places signifying that they understood the contents of the

Mortgage Bond. Just after the last place where the 2nd and 3rd

defendants signed together with the Notary, but before the attestation

clause of the Notary, the following certificate is found as part of the

Mortgage Bond.

47

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Signed by the abovenamed MANOHARY RAMACHANDRAN in my

presence and I hereby declare myself to be the Attorney-at-Law for

the said MANOHARY RAMACHANDRAN and that I subscribe my

name as such her Attorney-at-Law and that I have before the said

MANOHARY RAMACHANDRAN set her hand to These Presents

read and explained the contents of the above written instrument

the nature and meaning of the benefits of the Senatus Consultum

Velleianum and the Authentica Siqua Mulier and the effects of the

renunciation thereof by her and that she appeared to understand

the same.

Sgd

Attorney-at-Law

V. Balasubramaniam

Manohary Ramachandran is the 3rd defendant. V. Balasubramaniam,

Attorney-at-Law, is not the Notary Public who executed the Mortgage

Bond P4 but a different Attorney-at-Law.

The execution of the Mortgage Bond P4 was recorded as an admission

and therefore it was marked in evidence without any objection. The 3rd

defendant did not give evidence. The contents of the Mortgage Bond are

admitted facts.

In that backdrop, the last argument is also not entitled to succeed.

Case of the 4th-23rd defendants

Despite the agreements between the 2nd and 3rd defendants to sell the

apartment units to the 4th-23rd defendants, no deeds of transfer have

been executed up to now. There is a special procedure laid down in the

Apartment Ownership Law, No. 11 of 1973, as amended, regarding

registration of such deeds.

48

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

Although these defendants may have a cause of action against the 2nd

and 3rd defendants, they do not have a cause of action against the

plaintiff bank.

Far from granting reliefs, in my view, they should not have been added

as parties to the case (Weerapperuma v. De Silva (1958) 61 NLR 481).

The 4th-23rd defendants also state that the 2nd and 3rd defendants have

not waived the privilege of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis belonging

to them in law as guarantors, and that there is a novation of the

original loan agreement and therefore the plaintiff is disentitled to

enforce the Mortgage Bond given as security for the original loan.

I have already dealt with these two matters.

The appeal of the 4th-23rd defendants must necessarily fail.

Conclusion

The judgment of the Commercial High Court of Colombo dated

26.08.2011 is affirmed and the appeals of the 2nd and 3rd defendants,

and the 4th-23rd defendants are dismissed.

The attempt by the bank to recover the dues by selling the mortgaged

property by parate execution in terms of the Recovery of Loans by

Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, was unsuccessful due to

the majority decision of the Supreme Court in Ramachandran and

Others v. Hatton National Bank (supra) decided on 15.04.2005.

It is after the said decision, the plaintiff bank filed this hypothecary

action on 22.06.2006 to recover the dues to the bank by selling the

mortgaged property.

49

SC/CHC/APPEAL/3/2012

According to the loan agreement marked P3 and the loan ledger marked

P8, the loan of Rs. 30 million with interest at the rate of 23% per

annum and other levies were disbursed to the 1st defendant on

28.02.2001, which is more than 22 years ago. The plaintiff bank was

unable to recover this loan fully up to date despite the loan being

secured by a primary mortgage of an immovable property.

The 2nd and 3rd defendant-appellants each shall pay Rs. 1 million to the

plaintiff bank as costs of this appeal.

The 4th-23rd defendants seem to be innocent buyers of the units of the

apartment complex mortgaged to the plaintiff bank. But they have no

cause of action whatsoever against the plaintiff bank.
