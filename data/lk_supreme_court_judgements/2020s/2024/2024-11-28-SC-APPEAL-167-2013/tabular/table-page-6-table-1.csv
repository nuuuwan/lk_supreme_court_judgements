"D.V. Chandrasena, who was the Post Master of Puttalam in his evidence had stated inter alia",""
"as follows;",""
"•","that according to the envelope (P4) the letter had been posted on 12- 03-1993 and it was"
"","addressed to Kanapathi Ratnasamy (husband of the Respondent),"
"•","that the Registration No. 6329 on the envelope corresponded to the Registered Article"
"","Receipt (P11),"
"•","that the named recipient of the mentioned on the envelope has refused to accept it,"
"•","that they maintain postman’s minuets relating to delivery of letters and such minuets"
"","reveals that the postman was unable to deliver it as per one entry due to the reason the"
"","premises was closed and as per the other entry due to the fact that addressee refused to"
"","accept it."
"•","that when addressee refused to accept, they keep the letter for 15 days and thereafter,"

"The  evidence  of  the  said  post  master  on  balance  of  probability  proves  that  the  envelope",""
"containing  the  letter  for  attornment  had  been  refused  by  the  addressee,  the  husband  of  the",""
"Respondent. Thus, if the tenant was the husband of the that premises there is sufficient evidence",""
"to establish the refusal to accept the envelope containing the letter offering attornment. He must",""
"bear the consequence of his acts. Even though, the husband of the Respondent did not open the",""
"envelope to see the offer for attornment, it has to be construed as a refusal of attornment since",""
"offer could not be accepted due to his own fault. Most probably he refused to accept the delivery",""
"of the said letter because he knew what it may contain. Thus, there was evidence that amounts",""
"to refusal to attorn the Appellants as the new landlord of the premises by the husband of the",""
"Respondent who was the tenant at that time. Thus, from that time onwards they are in unlawful",""
"possession as they refused to enter into a new tenancy agreement with the new owner of the",""
"premises. As per the admission No.4 made at the beginning of the de novo trial, he was the",""
"tenant  of Kadiragaman,  previous landlord, and after his  demise  the Respondent  became the",""
"tenant  of  said  Kadiragaman.  However,  in  law,  Kadiragaman  cannot  create  a  new  tenancy",""
"relationship with the Respondent after the demise of the husband of the Respondent binding",""
"the Appellants without the approval of the Appellants as he was not the owner by that time.",""
"There cannot be a legally valid succession to or continuation of the tenancy of the husband of",""
"the Respondent as by his action of said refusal to accept the envelope containing the offer letter,",""
"he refused to enter into a valid contract of tenancy with the new owner. In common law, it is",""
"said that ‘hire goes before sale’. As such, the lessee or tenant can remain in the property till his",""
"lease  period  is  over.  As  no  long-term  written  lease  agreement  with  Kadiragaman  has  been",""
"tendered, the tenancy should have been based on a monthly tenancy. With the refusal to attorn",""
"to the new owner, the husband of the Respondent, then tenant refused his option to enter into",""
"a new tenancy agreement with the new landlord. When he refused to attorn and pay rent to the",""
"new landlord he loses his right to claim the protection under the  Rent Act as he becomes an",""
"unlawful occupier. In such situation there cannot be any continuation or succession of tenancy",""
"after  his  demise.  Therefore,  even  though  there  is  an  admission  that  after  the  demise  of  the",""
"husband of the Respondent, the Respondent became the tenant under Kadiragaman, there is an",""
"error of law in that as there cannot be a valid agreement of tenancy between the Respondent",""
"and the previous owner which binds the Appellants. In this regard, I prefer to quote following",""
