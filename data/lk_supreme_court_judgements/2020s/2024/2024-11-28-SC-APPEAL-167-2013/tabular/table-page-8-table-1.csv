"Even  though,  the  proviso  to  section  175(2)  read  along  with  section  120(1)  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance allows a party to an action to be called as a witness even without his name being"
"included in the list of witnesses.  In Dalton Wijeyeratne V Hermine Wijeyerattne (1993) 1"
"Sri L R 313, it was held that those sections do not enable one party to compel the other party"
"to give evidence. Peculiarly, when the Appellants (Plaintiffs) wanted to call the Respondent"
"(Defendant) to give evidence, the Counsel for the Respondent has not objected for calling the"
"Respondent as a witness by the Appellants’ counsel. The Respondent while giving evidence"
"has admitted, that during the inquiry at the rent board (though it was not an application recover"
"rent) there was a request from the Appellants to pay rent as they have purchased the land. Thus,"
"the  Respondent  herself  admits  that  there  was  an  oral  request  to  attorn  to  the  new  owners"
"accepting them as the landlord."
"The  above  indicates  that  there  were  offers  orally  as  well  as  in  writing  to  attorn  to  the  new"
"owners and pay rent in their name."
"In  certain  case  law,  long  occupation  after  the  change  of  ownership  appears  to  have  been"
"considered as indirect attornment. However, here the Respondent has not taken such stance in"
"her answer or issues. It is true that the Respondent has deposited rent at the authorised person"
"but those receipts do not indicate that money was deposited in the Appellant’s name.  Further,"
"while giving evidence, the Respondent has stated that they have to pay the rent to Kadiragaman,"
"previous landlord of the property, and they have not paid to the Appellants indicating that she"
"still considers the previous owner as the landlord. As such, long occupation by the Respondent"
"after the change of ownership of the property or payment of rent to the authorised person cannot"
"be considered as implied attornment. In this regard it is worth to refer to the decision made by"
"a bench of 5 judges in Gunasekara V Jinadasa (1996) 2 Sri L R 115, where it was held that"
"payment to the authorised person in the name of the person who is not the landlord does not"
"discharge the tenant’s obligation to the landlord. Similarly, there was continued occupation in"
"the said case but court declined to rely on the presumption of attornment due to long occupation"
"after the change of ownership. The said case also held the availability of vindicatory action to"
"evict a tenant who became a trespasser, when this kind of situations exist."
"Hence in my view, there were sufficient material on balance of probability to held in favour of"
"the Appellants that there was a refusal to attorn and therefore the Respondent falls within the"
"meaning of a trespasser. Thus, there were material to answer issues No. 2 and 8 raised in the"
"de novo trial (which are substantially the same as Issues No. 3 and 8 of the abandoned issues"
"which have been answered in favour of the Plaintiff by the learned District Judge) in favour of"
"the  Appellants  (Plaintiffs).  Thus,  the  action  filed  in  the  District  Court  had  to  be  decided  in"
"favour of the Plaintiff as per the evidence led in this case. The damages asked from the date of"
"the plaint is Rs.1000/- per month. Now the basis for calculating, should not be the rent paid but"
"the unlawful occupation as a trespasser. In that sense it appears to be very nominal amount."
"At the conclusion of the trial the learned trial Judge in the District Court of Puttalam answered"
"the abandoned set of 18 issues raised before the previous Judge and entered Judgment dated"
"10.12.2001 in favour of the Appellants inter alia on the following grounds:"
