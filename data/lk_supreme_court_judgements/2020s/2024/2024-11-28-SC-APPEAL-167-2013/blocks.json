Even though the envelope, as per evidence, was addressed to the husband of the Respondent, those two letters have been addressed to the Respondent as well as to her husband.

As per the said request made in that letter, rent was not paid to the Appellants. - vide pages 73 and 74. iv) Appellants have made complaints to the Rent Board and Mediation Board against the Respondent, her husband and some other people. The application to the Rent Board and its decision has been marked as P7 and P8 (found at pages 199/201 and 201/203 of the brief). As per P7, the application to the Rent Board was to get the vacant possession from the Respondent and P8 shows that the inquiry commenced in 04.11.1992 prior to the dates of aforesaid letter offering for attornment dated 10.03.1993. As per the decision mentioned in P8, Rent Board had advised the Appellant to seek legal remedy after an ex-parte inquiry held on 16.06.1993 due to the fact that the ownership could not be ascertained. P10 found at page 202/204 of the brief also indicate that mediation Board had issued a non-settlement certificate on 07.12.1993.",

As per the evidence given by William Rajapakshe, the Chairman, Mediation Board application before that Board was also to get the premises back on the footing that the Respondents were occupying it without permission. Perhaps during such inquiries, the Appellants would have informed orally that they have purchased the property. In fact, as referred to later in this Judgment, the Respondent in her evidence-in-chief has admitted that Appellants orally offered to attorn to them as the landlord during such inquiries even though the aforesaid application was to get the premises back for the Appellants.

    "text": "The evidence of the said post master on balance of probability proves that the envelope containing the letter for attornment had been refused by the addressee, the husband of the Respondent. Thus, if the tenant was the husband of the that premises there is sufficient evidence to establish the refusal to accept the envelope containing the letter offering attornment. He must bear the consequence of his acts. Even though, the husband of the Respondent did not open the envelope to see the offer for attornment, it has to be construed as a refusal of attornment since offer could not be accepted due to his own fault. Most probably he refused to accept the delivery of the said letter because he knew what it may contain. Thus, there was evidence that amounts to refusal to attorn the Appellants as the new landlord of the premises by the husband of the Respondent who was the tenant at that time. Thus, from that time onwards they are in unlawful possession as they refused to enter into a new tenancy agreement with the new owner of the premises. As per the admission No.4 made at the beginning of the de novo trial, he was the tenant of Kadiragaman, previous landlord, and after his demise the Respondent became the tenant of said Kadiragaman. However, in law, Kadiragaman cannot create a new tenancy relationship with the Respondent after the demise of the husband of the Respondent binding the Appellants without the approval of the Appellants as he was not the owner by that time. There cannot be a legally valid succession to or continuation of the tenancy of the husband of the Respondent as by his action of said refusal to accept the envelope containing the offer letter, he refused to enter into a valid contract of tenancy with the new owner. In common law, it is said that hire goes before sale. As such, the lessee or tenant can remain in the property till his lease period is over. As no long-term written lease agreement with Kadiragaman has been tendered, the tenancy should have been based on a monthly tenancy. With the refusal to attorn to the new owner, the husband of the Respondent, then tenant refused his option to enter into a new tenancy agreement with the new landlord. When he refused to attorn and pay rent to the new landlord he loses his right to claim the protection under the Rent Act as he becomes an unlawful occupier. In such situation there cannot be any continuation or succession of tenancy after his demise. Therefore, even though there is an admission that after the demise of the husband of the Respondent, the Respondent became the tenant under Kadiragaman, there is an error of law in that as there cannot be a valid agreement of tenancy between the Respondent and the previous owner which binds the Appellants. In this regard, I prefer to quote following passage from The Law of Property in Sri Lanka by G.L.Peiris, Volume Two, at page 235.",

The lessee had the option of cancelling or surrendering the lease and pursuing his remedy upon his contract against his landlord or of retaining occupation of the property in terms of his lease against the purchaser. But, in the event of his pursuing the latter course, he was under an obligation to pay rent to the purchaser and to perform all the other obligations due by him as tenant to his landlord. The option or privilege that the tenant had to decide whether he would become a tenant of the purchaser consisted in this, that it was open to him to cancel or surrender the lease if he did not desire to become a tenant of the purchaser. However, where he chose to continue in possession as tenant of the premises, he did not have any right to refuse to pay rent or to refrain from fulfilling the other obligations of a tenant to the purchaser.",

As such, long occupation by the Respondent after the change of ownership of the property or payment of rent to the authorised person cannot be considered as implied attornment. In this regard it is worth to refer to the decision made by a bench of 5 judges in Gunasekara V Jinadasa (1996) 2 Sri L R 115, where it was held that payment to the authorised person in the name of the person who is not the landlord does not discharge the tenants obligation to the landlord. Similarly, there was continued occupation in the said case but court declined to rely on the presumption of attornment due to long occupation after the change of ownership.

It was her husband who was the tenant at the relevant time. As explained above by his conduct, refusing to accept the letters sent by post by the new owner which contained the offer for attornment, impeded the possibility of making the offer observable. Thereafter, he or one who was under him should not be allowed to say that there was no offer. It is his own conduct that made the offer not available for him to read and act accordingly. On the other hand, the Respondent has admitted that during the Rent Board inquiries there was a request to attorn and pay the rent. It was the husband of the Respondent who was the tenant at that time as per the admission made. So, the refusal to accept the Appellants as landlords was by the then tenant, husband of the Respondent, and from that time onwards, he and occupants under him (including the Respondent) became trespassers as far as the Appellants are concerned. Thus, Respondent after the demise of the husband cannot enter into a new tenant and landlord relationship with the previous landlord as in a way to bind the new owners without the consent of the new owner, even though the admission says that the Respondent became a tenant of the previous landlord after her husbands demise which should have naturally taken place after the refusal to accept the letter containing the offer for attornment was made. Once the original tenant become a trespasser, there cannot be any continuation or succession to the tenancy rights which existed prior to that.",

On the other hand, there was evidence by the Respondent herself regarding the request made during the Rent Board inquiry to accept the tenancy with the new owner and pay rents to them which was not adhered to. As explained above even if there is an error in reasoning, after such refusal, then tenant and people under him including the Respondent became trespassers and there cannot be any continuation or succession to the tenancy that existed prior to that. Thus, issue No.2 (of new set) has to be answered in favour of the Appellants.",
