"[58]","The testimony of Siththy does not reveal that she informed the police party that the"
"","parcel belonged to Inoka, nor was it ‘put’ in issue when Piyapala or Jayakody was"
"","under cross examination.  The Court of Appeal correctly observed that Siththy did not"
"","speak about Inoka to the police and gave evasive answers in cross examination to the"
"","questions put to her concerning Inoka."
"[59]","This Court observes that the lapse on the part of Siththy’s evidence on this issue makes"
"","her testimony improbable and lacks trustworthiness due to concealing the identity of"
"","Inoka from the investigators and/ or when testifying in Court. If the parcel thrusted"

"","Siththy should have divulged that vital information, well knowing the inevitable risk"
"","attached to it for not having done so."

"","particular  witness  to 
testify  about  something  of  importance  for  the  defence  or"
"","imposing a burden on the Accused to prove her innocence. Nevertheless, the Judge"
"","has the right to comment on the failure of not calling a particular witness and make"
"","general observations, when the Court is aware that the particular witness had relevant"
"","evidence to testify upon the commencement of the defence case."
"[61]","Furthermore, when considering the credibility of the witnesses, the learned trial judge"
"","conducted an extensive analysis of both witnesses for the defence. The learned trial"
"","judge  concluded  that  the  evidence  of  both  these  witnesses  lacks  credibility  and  is"
"","improbable. As held in the case of Dharmasiri vs. Republic of Sri Lanka18:"
"","""Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge. Court of appeal will"
"","not lightly disturb the findings of trial Judge with regard to the credibility of a witness"
"","unless  such  findings  are  manifestly  wrong.  This  is  because  the  trial  Judge  has  the"
"","advantage of seeing the demeanour and deportment of the witness..."""
