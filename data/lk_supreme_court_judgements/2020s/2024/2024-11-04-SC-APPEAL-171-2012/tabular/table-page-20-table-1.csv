"[63]","For  all  the  reasons  stated  above,  this  Court  finds  that  the  evidence  given  by  the"
"","Accused-Appellant and the defence witness is not sufficient to create any doubt in the"
"","case for the prosecution and on that account the defence case is rejected."
"","The excessive intervention and interjection by the learned High Court Judge."
"[64]","The above concern was raised for the first time by the learned President’s Counsel for"
"","the accused appellant in his oral submissions to this Court and also by post hearing"
"","written submissions filed of record. However, no specific instance of the trial judge"
"","acting in such manner was brought to our attention."
"[65]","While the Court should be mindful of Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, it is"
"","well received and acknowledged that a presiding judge cannot be a silent spectator in"
"","the evidence collection process and it is not only his right but his duty to take part in"
"","finding  out  the  truth  to  reach  the  correct  conclusions.  In  the  process  of  evidence"
"","collection,  the  Court  must  be  alert  and  alive  and  make  use  of  whenever  it  thinks"
"","necessary to maintain fairness of the trial. This Section “…enables the judge to obtain"
"","what is described as “indicative” evidence, and which has been defined by Best as"
"","“evidence not in itself receivable but which is indicative of better.”21"
"[66]","One such way of Achieving fairness in a trial proceeding is to record questions put by"
"","the Court to the witness as questions by court or an indication to that effect, which the"
"","trial court was in conformity."
"[67]","There should be no absolute fetters placed to restrain the efficiency of a trial judge in"
"","establishing the facts in a criminal case. “If the object of the trial is, first to ascertain"
"","truth  by  the  light  of  reason,  and  then,  do  justice-conventionalized,  indeed-  justice"
"","according to law-upon the basis of this truth, then the judge is not only justified but"
"","required to elicit a fact, whenever these interests of truth and justice would suffer, if"
"","he did not.22”"
