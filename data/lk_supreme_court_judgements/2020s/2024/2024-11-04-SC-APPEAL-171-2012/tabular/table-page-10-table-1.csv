"","As held in the case of  R vs. Stephen Seneviratne8, the Privy Council held that the"
"","prosecution must call witnesses whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the"
"","narrative of the case. The Court further held that: “Their Lordships do not desire to"
"","lay down any rules to fetter discretion on a matter such as this, which is so dependent"
"","on the particular circumstances of each case. Still less do they desire to discourage"
"","the utmost candor and fairness on the part of those conducting prosecutions; but, at"
"","the same time, they cannot, speaking generally, approve of the idea that a prosecution"
"","must call witnesses irrespective of considerations of number and reliability.”"
"[28]","The woman police constable was a member of the arresting party and an eyewitness,"
"","though not the sole eyewitness, to the arrest and the seizure of the illegal substance."
"","As  held  in  the  case  of  Walimunige John vs.  The  State9,  where  two Accused  were"
"","convicted  of  murder,  one  argument  raised  in  the  appeal  was  the  failure  of  the"
"","prosecution to call two witnesses, whose names were on the back of the indictment"
"","and who were alleged to have been present at the scene. The Appellants argued that"
"","the trial judge should have directed the jury to draw an adverse inference from the"
"","prosecution’s  failure  to  call  these  witnesses,  as  per  Section  114(f)  of  the  Evidence"
"","Ordinance. The Court, however, reaffirmed that the prosecution  is  not obligated to"
"","call all witnesses listed on the indictment. It emphasized the prosecutor's discretion in"
"","determining which witnesses to present, and the Court saw no necessity to call the"
"","other  two  witnesses  because  their  evidence  would  have  been  merely  cumulative,"
"","supporting the testimony of the deceased's widow. The Court further held that the trial"
"","judge  is  not  required  to  instruct  the  jury  to  draw  adverse  inferences  unless  the"
"","omission of a witness creates a significant gap in the prosecution’s case."
"[29]","Accordingly, the application of Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance would arise"
"","when considering whether an adverse inference ought to be drawn from the absence"
"","of a witness who might be expected to give evidence on an important issue of fact."
