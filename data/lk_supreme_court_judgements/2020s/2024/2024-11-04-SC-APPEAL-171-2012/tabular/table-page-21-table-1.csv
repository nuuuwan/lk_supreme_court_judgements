"[68]","In the case of The Queen vs. Nimalasena de Zoysa23, questioning by the trial judge"
"","became  a  point  of  contention  in  the  Appeal.  The  main  issue  was  the  number  of"
"","questions  asked  by  the  Judge.  The  Appellant's  argued  that  the  Judge's  conduct,"
"","including asking numerous questions, prejudiced the defence. His Lordship the Chief"
"","Justice acknowledged the high number of questions asked by the trial judge, but held"
"","that the Judge's actions did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. The Court stated"
"","that simply asking a large number of questions, even more than the lawyers involved,"
"","was not in itself a reason to overturn the conviction unless it could be shown that it"
"","led  to  a  miscarriage  of  justice. The  court  concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  or"
"","complaint  that  the  Judge's  questioning  interfered  with  the  cross-examination  or"
"","examination of witnesses by either side. Therefore, the Court found that the volume"
"","of questions alone was insufficient to justify quashing the conviction."
"[69]","In the above case Basnayake C.J. observed that; “The section quoted above [Section"
"","165 of the Evidence Ordinance] gives the Judge a wide power. In order to discover or"
"","to obtain proper proof of relevant facts he may ask any question he pleases in any"
"","form, at any time, about any fact whether relevant or irrelevant. This power extensive"
"","though it be [sic] has limits, but those limits cannot be precisely defined. The trial"
"","Judge himself is the best arbiter of how and when he may exercise it. In its exercise a"
"","Judge should be careful not to usurp the functions of the prosecution or the defense.”"
"[70]","In this case we do not find any instance where the trial judge has over indulged himself"
"","of participating excessively in examination or cross examination of witnesses and/ or"
"","being intolerant and resentful towards the Counsel client relationship."
"[71]","In the circumstance, this Court is of the view that, in deciding on this Appeal the two"
"","questions on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted and which have been"
"","quoted earlier in this Judgement should be decided in the negative."
