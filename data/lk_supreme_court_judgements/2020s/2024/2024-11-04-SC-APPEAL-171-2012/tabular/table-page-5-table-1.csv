"","given  by  PW1  and  PW3,  leading  to  the  arrest  of  the Accused,  detection,  and  the"
"","seizure of the illegal substance."
"[9]","The  contradictions  that  are  sought  to  be  highlighted  would  fall  under  the  test  of"
"","consistency inter se arising from the evidence given by the detecting officer Piyapala"
"","and that of police constable Jayakody."
"[10]","Piyapala under cross examination stated that when he inquired from the Accused as"
"","to  what  contained  in  the  parcel,  she  looked  frightened  and  was  dumbfounded."
"","Thereafter, Piyapala had taken the parcel from her hand. Police constable Jayakody"
"","who was also a witness to this incident, under cross examination testified to the fact"
"","that when the Accused was stopped by Piyapala, she did not show any excitement."
"","The search party had then approached the Accused and Piyapala had pointed to a"
"","parcel  in  her  hand,  and  on  examination  they  observed  that  the  parcel  contained  a"
"","suspected substance. (Emphasis is mine)"
"[11]","Secondly, under cross examination Piyapala revealed that the informant approached"
"","the three-wheeler to part with the information regarding the Accused, and Jayakody’s"
"","evidence was that Piyapala walked up to the informant to receive the said information."
"[12]","It is observed that the above positions taken by the Accused-Appellant were not ‘put’"
"","to  the  corresponding  witness at  the  trial  stage  nor  was  this position  agitated  at  the"
"","hearing before the Court of Appeal."
