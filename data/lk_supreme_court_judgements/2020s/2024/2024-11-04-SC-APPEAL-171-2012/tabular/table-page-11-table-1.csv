"","The  Singapore  High  Court,  in  the  case  of  Cheong  Ghim  Fah  vs.  Murugian  s/o"
"","Rangasamy10, addressed the application of Section 116(g) of the Evidence Act, which"
"","is identical to Section 114(f) of the Sri Lankan Evidence Ordinance."
"","“Care  should  be  taken,  by  parties  intending  to  raise  such  an  inference,  to  “put”"
"","across the reasons for a witness’s absence in the course of cross-examination. This is"
"","to  give  the  opposing  party  an  opportunity  to  explain  the  absence  of  a  witness.  Of"
"","course, 
if  no  witnesses  are  called  or 
the  reason(s) 
for  a  witness’s  absence 
is"
"","undisputed, then the procedure of “putting” the issue does not arise.”"
"[30]","In fact, it is the same principle embodied in Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance,"
"","where it states that no particular number of witnesses is required for the proof of any"
"","fact. In Attorney General vs. Mohomed Saheeb Mohamed Ismath11, Jayasuriya J."
"","interpreted it to mean that evidence should be evaluated and weighed, not counted."
"[31]","The  withholding  or  absence  of  evidence  from  the  woman  police  constable  by  the"
"","prosecution was not identified at the trial stage. Had it been so, it would have assisted"
"","the  Court  in  their  approach  to  evaluating  the  evidence. This  was  also  not  an  issue"
"","identified before the Court of Appeal for determination."
"[32]","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  decided  that  the  evidence  placed  before  him  was"
"","sufficient to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt against the Accused. In all"
"","criminal cases, the onus of proving a charge beyond reasonable doubt lies upon the"
"","prosecution. It is for the prosecution to decide which witnesses are material to their"
"","case in proving it beyond reasonable doubt."
"[33]","It is a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide whether or not to call a"
"","witness.  If  the  prosecution,  in  withholding  material  evidence  in  its  possession,  is"
"","willfully suppressing such evidence, it would be presumed that the evidence would"
"","be unfavorable to the prosecution’s case."
