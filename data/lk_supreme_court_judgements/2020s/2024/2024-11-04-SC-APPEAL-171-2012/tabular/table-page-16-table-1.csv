"[49]","It is a well-established legal principle that “the most important journey is the inward"
"","journey, because the final Analyst report will be depend on that16.” Therefore, it is"
"","reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  admission  was  made  deliberately  and  with  full"
"","appreciation of its legal consequences. In the absence of any subsequent challenge or"
"","indication  of  error, 
it  can  be  concluded 
that 
there  was  no  mistake  of  fact  or"
"","misapprehension on the part of the defence at the time of the trial. Accordingly, the"
"","Court  is  justified  in  treating  the  admission  as  binding  and  conclusive,  and  the"
"","prosecution was under no obligation to provide additional evidence on the admitted"
"","facts. The contention of the defence that the prosecution had a duty to highlight any"
"","alleged  infirmities  is  unfounded,  as  the  responsibility  to  rectify  or  withdraw  an"
"","admission lies with the party who made it."
"","Failure to consider the Defence of the Accused-Appellant."
"[50]","This  position  is  advanced  by  the  Accused-Appellant  on  the  basis  that  she  had"
"","presented her defence by testifying before Court and the evidence of witness Siththy"
"","Fareena, with no marked material contradictions or omissions."
"","As pointed out by the Judgment by the Court of Appeal,"
"","“…the main thrust of the defence case was that due to the rejection by the Appellant"
"","of an improper advance made by a particular police officer called Herath, the police"
"","manipulated and fabricated this false charge against the Accused-Appellant. Apart"
"","from this bare assertion there is nothing to substantiate this accusation.”"
"[51]","When analyzing the evidence given by the Accused before the High Court, the Court"
"","of Appeal in its Judgment dated 14/06/2012 was mindful of the fact that the defence"
"","version of the events leading to the arrest of the Accused was “that the heroin was"
"","not introduced by the police but was a quantity of heroin brought by a person called"
"","Inoka and kept at Siththy Fareena’s place.”"
