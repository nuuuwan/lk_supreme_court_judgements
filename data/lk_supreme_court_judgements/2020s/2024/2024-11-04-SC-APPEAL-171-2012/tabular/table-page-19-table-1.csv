"","quotes the following regarding the credibility, with approval,"
"","“A  key  test  of  credibility  is  whether  the  witness  is  an  interested  or  disinterested"
"","witness. Rajaratnam J. in Tudor Perera v. AG (SC 23/75 D.C. Colombo Bribery 190/B"
"","– Minutes of S.C. Dated 1/11/1975) observed that when considering the evidence of"
"","an  interested  witness  who  may  desire  to  conceal  the  truth,  such  evidence  must  be"
"","scrutinized with some care. The independent witness will normally be referred to an"
"","interested  witness 
in  case  of  conflict.  Matters  of  motive,  prejudice,  partiality,"
"","accuracy, incentive, and reliability have all to be weighed (Vide, Halsbury Laws of"
"","England 4th Edition para 29).”"
"","In the same case, Tilakawardena J. cited Onnassi vs. Vergottis20 with approval, which"
"","states that: “one thing is clear, not so much as a rule of law but rather as a working"
"","rule  of  common  sense.  A  trial  judge  has,  except  on  rare  occasions,  a  very  great"
"","advantage over an appellate court; evidence of a witness heard and seen has a very"
"","great advantage over a transcript of that evidence; and a court of appeal should never"
"","interfere unless it is satisfied both that the judgment ought not to stand and that the"
"","divergence  of  view  between  the  trial  judge  and  the  court  of  appeal  has  not  been"
"","occasioned by any demeanor of the witnesses or truer atmosphere of the trial (which"
"","may have eluded the appellate court) or by any other of those advantages which the"
"","trial judge possesses.”"
"[62]","Having evaluated the evidence, the learned trial Judge and the Judges of the Court of"
"","Appeal came to the same conclusion that the prosecution has discharged its burden"
"","by proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. Both Courts also held that the evidence"
"","given by the Accused-Appellant and Siththy Fareena are not cogent, improbable, and"
"","unbelievable."
