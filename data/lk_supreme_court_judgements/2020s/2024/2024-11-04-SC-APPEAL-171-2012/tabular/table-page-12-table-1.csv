"[34]","When the Court is called upon to decide whether it is appropriate to draw an adverse"
"","presumption against the prosecution under Section 114(f), all the circumstances of the"
"","case  should  be  considered  to  determine  whether  the  failure  to  call  that  material"
"","witness would adversely impact the prosecution’s case. If not, the application of the"
"","presumption does not arise."
"[35]","“The question of who should be called to give evidence for the prosecution is for the"
"","prosecuting counsel to resolve. Where counsel is reluctant to call a witness, it is wrong"
"","for the trial judge to insist on the witness being called by the prosecution.”  (R. vs."
"","Grafton12)"
"[36]","In the facts of this case, no adverse inference could be drawn by this Court against the"
"","prosecution for the alleged willful suppression of the truth, which would inhibit the"
"","interests of justice. In these circumstances, Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance"
"","would not be applicable."
"","The inherent discrepancies in the inward journey."
"[37]","It is alleged that the lapses in the inward journey of productions cannot be cured by"
"","an  admission  under  Section  420  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure Act.  It  is  also"
"","alleged that there were glaring lapses in the chain of custody in the evidence of the"
"","witnesses prior to the said admission which the prosecution was bound to bring to the"
"","attention of Court."
"[38]","Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:"
"","“It shall not be necessary in any summary prosecution or trial on indictment for either"
"","party to lead proof of any fact which is admitted by the opposite party…"
"","Such admissions may be made before or during the trial."
