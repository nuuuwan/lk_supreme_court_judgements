"","creditworthy. A procedural irregularity cannot be a ground to discredit the testimony"
"","of a witness and certainly should not be a ground for acquittal."
"","Conscious decision not to call PW4 the woman police constable"
"[26]","I may approach the above question of fact by citing the case of Naranjan Shel vs."
"","State of Tripura5, where it was held that, “…if the evidence available on record is"
"","sufficient  to  prove  the  case  beyond  any  doubt,  then  the  non-examination of  one  or"
"","some of the witnesses may not result in discarding the whole prosecution case, which"
"","is otherwise found proved from the available material on record.”"
"","Furthermore,  as  per  R  vs.  Russell-Jones6  “The  prosecution  enjoys  discretion"
"","regarding  whether  to  call,  or  tender,  any  witness  they  require  to  attend,  but  the"
"","discretion is not unfettered.”"
"[27]","It was submitted that the decision not to call the woman police constable raises a doubt"
"","about the presence of the woman constable at the detection and arrest, and it is urged"
"","for the consideration of the application of Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance."
"","In Devunderage Nihal vs. AG7, the key issue was whether corroboration is required"
"","in  drug-related  offences.  Initially,  the  Court  of Appeal  held  that  corroboration  was"
"","necessary when trained officers conducted raids, allowing the defence to challenge"
"","the prosecution's evidence. The Attorney General appealed, arguing that this imposed"
"","an undue burden on the prosecution, as Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance states"
"","that “no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of"
"","any  fact.”  The  Supreme  Court  held  that  corroboration  is  not  mandatory  for  a"
"","conviction  in  cases  involving  police  detection  and  it  is  not  legally  required  unless"
"","specified by law, and a conviction can be sustained based on a single credible witness"
"","if their testimony is deemed trustworthy."
