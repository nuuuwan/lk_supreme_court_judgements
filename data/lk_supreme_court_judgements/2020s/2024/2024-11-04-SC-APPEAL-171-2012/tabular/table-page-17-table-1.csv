"[52]","The Court of Appeal in the said Judgment also observed that “apart from this bare"
"","assertion there is nothing to substantiate this accusation.” According to the evidence"
"","of  the  Accused,  on  the  day  of  the  raid,  the  police  party  arrived  at  her  house"
"","accompanied by Siththy who had in her possession a parcel, the contents of which"
"","were thrust upon the Accused. Siththy’s version of events reveals that a person called"
"","Inoka had left the parcel with her."
"[53]","In cross examination the Accused implicated a person named Herath of fabricating a"
"","false charge against her. The submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel in"
"","Court was that the fabrication was at the instigation of the Accused resisting improper"
"","advances made towards her."
"[54]","However, this position was never suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses other"
"","than to be revealed in cross examination of Piyapala, that a police officer by that name"
"","was  attached  to  the  Blumandal  Police  Station  and  not  to  the  Mutwal  Police,  from"
"","where the detection was carried out."
"[55]","It  was  not  the  position  of  the  Accused  that  placing  the  parcel  of  heroin  in  her"
"","possession by the police party, was due to the instigation of Herath. At no time had"
"","the defence suggested to Piyapala or any other witness of the said fabrication nor was"
"","it suggested that an acrimony prevailed between any of the prosecution witnesses and"
"","the Accused, at any time of detection."
"[56]","As held in the case of Gunasiri and 2 Others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka17"
"","“It  is  a  rule  of  essential  justice  that  whenever  the  opponent  has  declined  to  avail"
"","himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must follow that the"
"","evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.”"
"[57]","It was admitted by the Accused that Herath was not amongst the raiding party that"
"","arrested the Accused. Therefore, his identity remains elusive to the investigator."
