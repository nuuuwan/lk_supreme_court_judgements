"","Accused by PW1 and  that it was this same  parcel which was examined and in the"
"","custody  of  PW2.  With  the  said  formal  admission  in  terms  of  Section  420,  the"
"","prosecution did not lead further evidence to substantiate the inward or the outward"
"","journey of the said production."
"[45]","If  the Accused-Appellant  alleges  that  such  evidentiary  admissions  relied  upon  by"
"","Court are erroneous or not conclusive, the Court may afford an opportunity to tender"
"","an  explanation  and  clarify 
the  point  on  such  question  of  admission.  No  such"
"","application  was  made  before  the  trial  court  or  before  the  Court  of Appeal  for  an"
"","appropriate order to be made. Then the question arises as to who should make that"
"","application.  The  position  of  the  Accused-Appellant  is  that  the  prosecution  had  a"
"","bounden duty to bring to the attention of court of such infirmity."
"[46]","The  admissions  in  terms  of  Section  420  were  disclosed  at  the  hearing  with  the"
"","agreement of both counsels. It referred specifically to the evidence of PW1 and PW2."
"","It was the same counsel who represented the Accused when PW1 and PW2 were cross"
"","examined.  When 
there 
is  clear  evidence  of 
the  facts  admitted  on  record 
it 
is"
"","unnecessary for the prosecution to lead further evidence of proof pertaining to such"
"","facts."
"[47]","An admission can be made at the hearing when the witness is under cross examination"
"","or at any time of the trial by the Accused or by Counsel who represents him. The usual"
"","practice  of  Court  is  to  record  such  admissions  in  the  proceedings,  ascribing  due"
"","consent of the parties."
"[48]","In proceedings dated 03/02/2011, it is clearly stated that the Counsel for the Accused"
"","made  an  oral  application  that  he  does  not  wish  to  contest  the  contents  of  the  said"
"","admission. Thereafter in terms of Section 420, the court relying on the said admission"
"","proceeded to record acceptance of the said evidence. When an admission during the"
"","trial  is  not  specifically  traversed  by  either  party,  the  Court  is  entitled  to  draw  an"
"","inference that the same has been admitted."
