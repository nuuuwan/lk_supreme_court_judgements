In terms of section 23 of the Ordinance, in a situation where an individual bhikku departs from this world, without alienating his pudgalika property acquired by him during his life time, such property would deem to be the property of the temple even though such property had been acquired without ceremony and dedication in the manner prescribed in the Vinaya.
