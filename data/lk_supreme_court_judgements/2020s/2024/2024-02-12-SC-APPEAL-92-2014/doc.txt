Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs, the father and the daughter respectively, filed this

action more than 21 years ago by plaint dated 16.01.2003, seeking

ejectment of the defendant from the premises known as New Lanka

Stores described in the schedule to the plaint and damages on the basis

that the defendant is the overholding tenant. The defendant filed answer

seeking the dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration of title to

the premises described in the schedule to the answer on long

possession. In other words, he was claiming title to the premises by

prescription. However, he did not specify against whom he was seeking

4

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

prescriptive possession. He never denied in the answer that he is in

possession of New Lanka Stores. The plaintiffs filed a replication

seeking the dismissal of the claim in reconvention. The plaintiffs also

averred that the premises described in the answer is the same premises

described in the schedule to the plaint. They further averred that after

the institution of the action, the defendant removed the business name

New Lanka Stores to another place in the Horawpathana town but

continued to carry on a similar business in the premises in suit.

During the pendency of the case, the 1st plaintiff and the defendant died.

The 1st plaintiff had transferred the premises to the 2nd plaintiff prior to

the institution of the action by Deed marked P10. Hence the 2nd plaintiff

(hereinafter the plaintiff) proceeded with the case. The three children of

the defendant (hereinafter the defendant) were substituted in place of

the deceased defendant.

The case for the plaintiff is that the plaintiff rented out the premises to

the defendant on a monthly rent of Rs. 500. The defendant was informed

by letter dated 11.08.2002 marked P1 that the rent would be increased

to Rs. 6000 from 01.01.2003 and if he was unable to pay the said sum,

the monthly tenancy would be terminated from that date. The defendant

did not reply to this letter. He refused to pay even the old rent from

September 2002. Thereafter, the plaintiff sent the letter dated 02.01.2003

marked P3 terminating the monthly tenancy and demanding the

defendant to hand over the premises on 15.01.2003. The defendant

neither replied to this letter nor handed over the premises. It is thereafter

the action was filed in the District Court.

At the trial, on behalf of the plaintiff, nine witnesses (including the

plaintiff) have given evidence and documents P1-P22 have been

produced. The plaintiffs case had been formally closed on 21.02.2007. I

must observe that most of those witnesses have been called as a matter

5

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

of course. Documents have been marked subject to proof for no reason.

Witnesses have been called to prove documents which were not marked

subject to proof.

On behalf of the defendant no witnesses have been called but two

documents marked V1 and V2 have been produced. The defendants case

had been formally closed on 29.02.2012.

No evidence whatsoever had been led before the judge who pronounced

the judgment. By judgment dated 10.08.2012 the plaintiffs case has

been dismissed on the sole basis that the premises in suit has not been

identified by the plaintiff. The defendants cross-claim has also been

dismissed on the basis that it has not been proved.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court and entered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the

plaint. This appeal by the defendant is against the judgment of the High

Court.

This Court has granted leave to appeal mainly on two questions of law:

(a) Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider that the

plaintiff has not identified the subject matter of the action?

(b) Has the High Court of Civil Appeal failed to consider that the

plaintiff has not discharged the burden of proof in a civil action?

Let me now consider those two questions of law.

As the High Court has correctly pointed out, there was no reason for the

District Judge to dismiss the plaintiffs action on the basis that the

premises in suit has not been identified by the plaintiff when there was

no such issue raised by the defendant at the trial. When the defendant

described the premises in suit in his answer differently, the plaintiff in

6

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

the replication stated that it is the same premises. Thereafter, the

defendant did not raise an issue on the identification of the premises.

I will reproduce below the English version of the defendants issues and

the answers given by the District Judge thereto to make this point clear:

(10) Has the defendant been in possession of the premises

described in the schedule to the answer for a long time?

Not proved.

(11) If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, is the

defendant entitled to the relief as prayed for in paragraph (a) to the

answer?

In view of the above answer, does not arise.

(12) Has a cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the

defendant?

The cause of action against the defendant has not been proved.

(13) Has the plaintiff filed this action maliciously?

Not proved.

(14) Has the case No. 19049/RE been filed by the plaintiff against

the defendant in the same Court on the same cause of action?

Not proved.

(15) If so, can the plaintiff maintain this action?

In view of the above answer, does not arise.

(16) If one or several of the above issues are answered in favour of

the defendant, is the defendant entitled to the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer to the answer?

The defendant is entitled to the relief for the dismissal of the

plaintiffs action.

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

The District Judge did not answer the plaintiffs issues on the basis that

the premises in suit have not been identified.

When the identification of the subject matter was not put in issue at the

trial, the District Judge cannot find an easy way out to write the judgment

stating that the subject matter has not been properly identified by way of

an assessment number.

It is true that the plaintiff has not identified the premises in suit in the

schedule to the plaint by an assessment number. But in almost all the

correspondence, including the ones attached to the plaint, the premises

have been identified as No. 45. This includes the letter of termination of

tenancy. The plaintiff has marked several letters including P4, P5 and P6

sent by none other than the defendants lawyer to the plaintiff with money

orders as monthly rentals for premises No. 45.

P9 dated 14.02.1988 is a statement made by the defendant to the

Horowpathana police station. This was not marked subject to proof

although a police officer who typed it was called as a witness. Martin

referred to therein is the plaintiff. It reads as follows:

04

45 :

100/= .

.

. .

This puts the matter beyond doubt that the defendant was the monthly

tenant of the plaintiff at assessment No. 45 and there is no issue

regarding the identification of the subject matter.

At the argument, learned counsel for the defendant drew the attention of

the Court to the Fiscals Report marked P17 to say that there is an issue

8

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

regarding identification of the premises. I cannot agree. This Fiscals

Report is in respect of another case No. 12581/L filed by the plaintiff

against another person, namely Karunaratne. According to the Fiscals

Report, the possession of the entire land described in the schedule to the

plaint in extent of 19.37 perches had been handed over to the plaintiff on

08.09.1999. Learned counsel for the defendant argues that, if the

possession of the entire land was handed over to the plaintiff on

08.09.1999, the plaintiffs version that the defendant is in part of the land

even now cannot be believed.

This matter has been explained by the plaintiff during the cross-

examination and in answer to the Courts questioning. In answering the

Courts questioning the plaintiff has stated that within 19.37 perches,

there are five business premises in a row belonging to the plaintiff. Case

No. 12581/L was in respect of No. 37. In the execution of the decree in

case No. 12581/L, the defendant was not ejected from his premises (No.

45) because there was no issue with the defendant at that time vide

pages 14-16 of the District Court proceedings dated 09.11.2005.

I affirm the finding of the High Court of Civil Appeal that there was no

issue in the District Court trial as to the identity of the subject matter.

Learned counsel for the defendant did not press the argument on the

second question of law. The second question of law is on the burden of

proof. The plaintiff did not file a rei vindicatio action. The plaintiff filed the

action as the landlord against the defendant as the overholding monthly

tenant. As I explained earlier, the monthly tenancy has unequivocally

been admitted by the defendant. The termination of monthly tenancy was

proved by P3 and P3(a). The plaintiffs action is based not on ownership

but on the violation of the privity of contract. The plaintiffs main relief is

the ejectment of the defendant, not the declaration of title to the premises.

In cases of this nature, seeking a declaration of title is customary, yet it

9

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

is superfluous. Although the plaintiff produced the title deed, it was not

necessary as the defendant tenant cannot question the plaintiffs

ownership to the property by operation of the principle of estoppel

embodied in section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such

tenant, shall during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to

deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the beginning of the

tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and no person who

came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in

possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had

a title to such possession at the time when such licence was given.

In Ruberu v. Wijesooriya [1998] 1 Sri LR 58 at 60, Gunawardana J. held:

Whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is foreign to

a suit in ejectment against either. The licensee (the defendant-

respondent) obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it upon the

terms that he will not dispute the title of him, i.e. the plaintiff-

appellant without whose permission, he (the defendant-respondent)

would not have got it. The effect of the operation of section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title

under which he is in occupation he must, first, quit the land. The fact

that the licensee or the lessee obtained possession from the plaintiff-

appellant is perforce an admission of the fact that the title resides in

the plaintiff. No question of title can possibly arise on the pleadings

in this case, because, as the defendant-respondent has stated in his

answer that he is a lessee under the plaintiff-appellant, he is

estopped from denying the title of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an

inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will ever be permitted

10

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

either to question the title of the person who gave him the lease or

the licence or the permission to occupy or possess the land or to set

up want of title in that person, i.e. of the person who gave the licence

or the lease. That being so, it is superfluous, in this action, framed

as it is on the basis that the defendant-respondent is a licensee, to

seek a declaration of title.

The difference between a rei vindicatio action based on ownership and an

action for ejectment based on the breach of the contract was lucidly

explained by Gratiaen J. in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169

at 172-173:

In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the

recovery of the property and for the ejectment of the person in

wrongful occupation. The plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the

very essence of the action. Maasdorps Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96.

The scope of an action by a lessor against an overholding lessee for

restoration and ejectment, however, is different. Privity of contract

(whether it be by original agreement or by attornment) is the

foundation of the right to relief and issues as to title are irrelevant

to the proceedings. Indeed, a lessee who has entered into

occupation is precluded from disputing his lessors title until he has

first restored the property in fulfilment of his contractual obligation.

The lessee (conductor) cannot plead the exceptio dominii, although

he may be able easily to prove his own ownership, but he must by

all means first surrender his possession and then litigate as to

proprietorship Voet 19.2.32.

Both these forms of action referred to are no doubt designed to

secure the same primary relief, namely, the recovery of property. But

11

SC/APPEAL/92/2014

the cause of action in one case is the violation of the plaintiffs rights

of ownership, in the other it is the breach of the lessees contractual

obligation.

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way

of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in

truth an action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding

tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the

declaration is based on proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of

the contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the lessor is

the true owner.

The plaintiff proved his case as required by law. The defendant manifestly

failed to prove his case or resist the plaintiffs claim successfully.

I answer the two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted

in the negative and affirm the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

The defendants are in unlawful possession since 15.01.2003. The

premises in suit are business premises. In addition to the reliefs as

prayed for in the prayer to the plaint, each substituted defendant shall

pay Rs. 200,000 (Rs. 600,000 in total) as costs of this appeal to the

plaintiff.
