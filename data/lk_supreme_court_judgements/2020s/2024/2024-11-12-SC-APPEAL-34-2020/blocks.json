She has not testified regarding a fight between the deceased and the Appellant. Thangarasa Nilan had also only heard someone shouting. That sound had emanated from the house in which shortly afterwards the deceased was found with injuries. There is also the hearsay evidence elicited from Thangarasa Nilan, that Jacintha had purportedly told him that while the deceased and the Appellant were fighting inside the Appellants house, Jegan (the Appellant) took a knife and the deceased had come running into the house of the witness. Thus, there is some material in the case record of the possible existence of a fight between the deceased and the Appellant at a time before the Appellant stabbed the deceased. The nature of the fight, the circumstances under which the fight commenced and occurred and whether the fighting continued till the Appellant having finally attacked the deceased inside Easwary Somasundarams house, is not in evidence. The issue to be determined is whether the hearsay evidence of Jacintha is sufficient to attract the mitigatory plea of a sudden fight.",

Unless it come within the several exceptions to the rule against the admissibility of hearsay evidence, hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Even otherwise, very little evidence can be attached to hearsay evidence. Secondly, even that hearsay evidence does not reveal the exact nature of the fight and the circumstances under which the Appellant had attacked the deceased. In the circumstances, it is not possible to determine whether the alleged occurrence of the fight between the deceased and the Appellant come within the ambit of the 4th exception to section 294 of the Penal Code. Furthermore, the Appellant who was ideally placed to provide testimony regarding the circumstances relating to the purported fight between him and the deceased, chose not to provide that testimony and instead denied even being present at the scene of the crime. Due to all these reasons, I am unable to accept the submission of learned counsel for the Appellant that the evidence relating to this case should attract the imposition of culpability only",
