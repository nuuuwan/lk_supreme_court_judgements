"he replied “Ayyo, Jegan stabbed me.” The Appellant was known in the village"
"as  ‘Jegan’.  It  is  in  evidence  that  afterwards,  some  others  had  rushed  the"
"deceased to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries."
"9.  The  other  lay  witness  who  testified  for  the  prosecution  was  Thangarasa"
"Nilan - the son of Easwary Somasunderam. According to him, on the day of"
"the incident, when he was washing his face, he heard a noise from within the"
"house in which he and his mother lived. He rushed into the house and saw"
"the deceased lying in the hall in a pool of blood. When he looked around, he"
"saw a person weaking a black colour jacket leaving the compound in which"
"the two houses were situated. In several respects, his testimony corroborates"
"the testimony of his mother Easwary Somasunderam."
"10. Thangarasa  Nilan  has  provided  hearsay 
evidence 
relating 
to 
some"
"information given to him by one Jacintha, who had arrived at the scene soon"
"afterwards.  [Iiaiyarajah  Jacintha 
is  a  witness 
listed  on  the  back  of  the"
"indictment,  whose 
testimony  was  not  presented  at 
the 
trial  by 
the"
"prosecution. According to the record, she had been overseas at the time of"
"the  trial.]  Apparently,  Jacintha  had  told  Nilan  that  the  deceased  and  the"
"Appellant were seen by her fighting inside the Appellant’s house, Jegan (the"
"Appellant) took a knife and the deceased had come out of that house and run"
"into  the  house  of  the  witness.  The  ‘incident’  (ostensibly  a  reference  to  the"
"stabbing)  had  occurred  inside  the  house  of  Easwary  Somasunderam  and"
"Thangarasa Nilan (mother and son)."
"11. Based on the findings arising out of the post mortem examination conducted"
"on 
the  body  of 
the  deceased  by 
Judicial  Medical  Officer  Dr.  Sinniah"
"Sivaruban, he has expressed expert opinion that as a result of the attack on"
"the deceased by a sharp cutting instrument, the deceased had sustained two"
"cut injuries in the region of the right elbow, a cut injury on the shoulder, and"
"another cut injury on the left side of the chest. There had been a stab injury"
"near the left nipple which had penetrated between the 5th and 6th intercostal"
"space. Internally, the heart of the deceased had been pierced. According to"
"Dr.  Sivaruban,  it  is  that  injury  in  the  heart  of  the  deceased  which  was"
"sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased,"
"and which  in  fact  resulted in  the  death of the deceased.  The  Post Mortem"
"Report  had  been  produced  at 
the 
trial  marked  “P1”.  The  doctor  has"
"expressed the view that the knife marked “P2” referred to in the following"
"paragraph  was  capable  of  causing  the  injuries  found  on  the  body  of  the"
"deceased."
