"","principles contained in the Judgment of then Chief Justice, Hon. Dr. Shirani"
"","Bandaranayake,  in  Gurudeniya  Lekamgedara  Nishantha  Bandara  Vs.  the"
"","Hon. Attorney General [(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 55], and therefore shall be guided"

"","28. It is now necessary to revert to the facts of the case, with special reference to"
"the  mitigatory  plea  of  sudden","fight.  As  stated  above,  what  Easwary"
"","Somasundaram had heard a few minutes prior to the incident was ‘someone’"
"","shouting. She has not testified regarding a fight between the deceased and"
"","the Appellant.  Thangarasa Nilan had also only heard  ‘someone’ shouting."
"","That sound had emanated from the house in which shortly afterwards the"
"","deceased was found with injuries. There is also the hearsay evidence elicited"
"","from Thangarasa Nilan, that Jacintha had purportedly told him that while"
"","the deceased and the Appellant were fighting inside the Appellant’s house,"
"","Jegan (the Appellant) took a knife and the deceased had come running into"
"","the house of the witness. Thus, there is some material in the case record of"
"","the possible existence of a fight between the deceased and the Appellant at a"
"","time before the Appellant stabbed the deceased. The nature of the fight, the"
"","circumstances under which the fight commenced and occurred and whether"
"","the fighting continued till the Appellant having finally attacked the deceased"
"","inside Easwary Somasundaram’s house, is not in evidence. The issue to be"
"","determined is whether the hearsay evidence of Jacintha is sufficient to attract"
"the mitigatory plea of a sudden fight.",""
"","29. I  have  considered  this  matter.  I  refrain  from  acting  upon  the  afore-stated"
"","evidence  due  to  the  following  reasons:  First,  the  information  said  to  have"
"been  passed  on 
to  Thangarasa  Nilan  by","Jacintha  amounts 
to  hearsay"
"","evidence. Unless it come within the several exceptions to the rule against the"
"","admissibility  of  hearsay  evidence,  hearsay  evidence  is  inadmissible.  Even"
"otherwise,  very","little  evidence  can  be  attached 
to  hearsay  evidence."
"","Secondly, even that hearsay evidence does not reveal the exact nature of the"
"","fight  and  the  circumstances  under  which  the  Appellant  had  attacked  the"
"","deceased. In the circumstances, it is not possible to determine whether the"
"","alleged occurrence of the fight between the deceased and the Appellant come"
"","within  the  ambit  of  the  4th  exception  to  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code."
"","Furthermore,  the  Appellant  who  was  ideally  placed  to  provide  testimony"
"","regarding the circumstances relating to the purported fight between him and"
"","the deceased, chose not to provide that testimony and instead denied even"
"","being present at the scene of the crime. Due to all these reasons, I am unable"
"","to  accept  the  submission  of  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  that  the"
"","evidence relating to this case should attract the imposition of culpability only"
