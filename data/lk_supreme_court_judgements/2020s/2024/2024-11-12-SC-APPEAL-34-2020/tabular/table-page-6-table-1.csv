"Court  of  Appeal  should  have  considered  whether  the  culpability  of  the"
"Appellant should be viewed from the perspective of the 4th exception to the"
"offence  of  murder  contained  in  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code.  Learned"
"counsel submitted that in the circumstances, the culpability of the Appellant"
"should be for the offence of ‘Culpable homicide not amounting to murder’ and"
"not for the offence of ‘Murder’. In the circumstances, learned counsel moved"
"this Court to be pleased to mitigate the culpability of the Appellant to the"
"offence of ‘Culpable homicide not amounting to murder’, quash the conviction"
"and  sentence  for  ‘murder’  and  therefor  impose  a  lawful  sentence  which"
"corresponds to the lessor offence."
