"denial coupled with an alibi defence. Therefore, it is evident that the ground"
"of  Appeal  urged  before  this  Court  has  been  raised  for  the  very  first  time."
"What aggravates the situation is that, in proceedings before this Court, the"
"judgment of the Court of Appeal was sought to be impugned on a question"
"of law which does not arise from the impugned Judgment of that court. That"
"in my view is a fundamental error, which should be avoided by counsel who"
"appeared before this Court. In an Appeal to this Court against a judgment of"
"the Court of Appeal where that court has exercised appellate jurisdiction, the"
"purpose of the Appeal should be to canvass a question of law that arises from"
"such judgment of the Court of Appeal. That is evident when one examines"
"provisions  of  Articles  127  and  128  of  the  Constitution  together  with  the"
"applicable Rules of the Supreme Court."
