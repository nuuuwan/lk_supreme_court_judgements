Samayawardhena, J.

At the time of filing this application in the Court of Appeal, the petitioner

company was engaged in importing vehicles. It had imported several used

vehicles on or about 14.10.2004. The 1st respondent, the Minister of

Finance, increased excise duty for imported vehicles effective from

15.10.2004. The petitioner filed this application in the Court of Appeal

on 04.11.2004 (20 years ago) seeking the following, in my view, vague

reliefs.

a) Issue notice on the respondents in the first instance

b) Grant an interim relief by way of a stay order by suspending the

operation of the impugned Gazette Notification marked X4 and X5

and Orders marked X2, X3 and also Gazette Notification No.

1362/12 yet to be published so as to enable the petitioner to clear

the vehicles already arrived and unloaded in the Colombo Harbour

on provisional basis either by keeping only the documents with the

Sri Lanka Customs OR by keeping a Bank Guarantee for the Duty

8 SC/APPEAL/11/2006

Difference with the Sri Lanka Customs until the final determination

of this case

c) Grant an interim relief by way of a stay order by suspending or

restraining the 1st Respondent, 2nd Respondent and 3rd Respondent

from implementing, publishing another Gazette Notification imposing

new Excise Duty rates and Depreciation Table for used vehicles

already landed for those vehicles that have been ordered and still in

transit

d) Grant a mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari to quash the

impugned Gazette Notification marked as X4 and X5 and ministerial

orders marked X2 and X3 and also Gazette Notification No. 1362/12

yet to be published

e) Grant mandates in the nature of writ of prohibitions restraining the

1st Respondent, 2nd Respondent and 3rd Respondent from

implementing and publishing another Gazette Notification imposing

new excise duty rates and Depreciation Table for used vehicles

already landed and for those vehicles that have been ordered and

still in transit

f) Grant a mandate in the nature of the writ of mandamus to compel

the Minister to validly exercise the power and duty conferred on the

Minister by the relevant statute by acting reasonably within the

framework of the law

g) Declare that a collection of excise duty without any Gazette

Notification being published from 01.01.2004 to 20.05.2004 was

illegal and ultra vires and repugnant to the Exercise (Special

Provisions Act No. 13 of 1989)

h) For costs

i) Any other and further relief Your Lordships Court deem meet

The petitioner has sought to quash X2-X5 and Gazette No. 1362/12 yet

to be published by writs of certiorari.

9 SC/APPEAL/11/2006

The petitioner prayed to quash X2 dated 14.10.2004, which is a

Depreciation Table issued by the 2nd respondent, the Secretary to the

Ministry of Finance, in pursuance of an Order issued by the Minister of

Finance, under the Customs (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2003. The

Gazette No. 1362/15 dated 14.10.2004, which published this Table by

the 2nd respondent was marked X4. The Depreciation Table cannot stand

on its own; it is based on the Ministers Order/Gazette, which was not

tendered or sought to be quashed by the petitioner. Without seeking to

quash the Ministers Order/Gazette relevant to X2 and X4, there is no

basis to quash X2 and X4.

X3 dated 14.10.2004 is the Ministers Order made under the Excise

(Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 1989, not under the Customs

(Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2003. Gazette No. 1341/28 dated 20.05.2004

marked X5 as the Gazette relevant to X3 is a different one, not relevant

to X3.

The petitioner has tendered a number of other documents including

Orders, Gazettes and documents obtained from various sources

including the Government Printing Department, by way of counter

affidavit and motions. The brief is very complicated and bulky consisting

three volumes.

Be that as it may, after the hearing, the Court of Appeal by judgment

dated 21.10.2005 dismissed the petitioners application subject to the

observations made by the Court in the judgment. By way of

observations, the Court remarked that the Gazettes would not apply to

vehicles imported before 20.10.2004, as the publication of the Gazettes

was done after that date.

The Gazettes referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal are X4

and X5. The Court of Appeal made observations on the basis that the

10 SC/APPEAL/11/2006

Ministers Order marked X3 was Gazetted in the Gazette marked X5,

which is not correct. The relevant Gazette was X11, tendered with the

counter affidavit. The Court of Appeal did not state anything regarding

X11.

If the petitioner contends and the Court of Appeal too thinks that what

matters is the date of publication of the Gazette, not the date of the Order

of the Minister, there is no material to establish the actual publication of

the Gazettes.

Although the said observations of the Court of Appeal are against the

Minister, the Minister did not seek special leave to appeal from the

judgment of the Court of Appeal, but only the Secretary to the Treasury

(the original 2nd respondent) and the Director General of Customs (the

original 3rd respondent) sought special leave to appeal from this Court by

petition dated 02.12.2005. This is what the said two respondents (as the

1st and 2nd petitioners) sought from this Court:

WHEREFORE the 1st and 2nd Petitioners respectively pray that Your

Lordships Court be pleased to:

a) Grant Petitioners Special Leave to Appeal to Your Lordships Court

from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 21.12.2005 [sic],

produced marked H hereto:

b) Set aside that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which

holds that the order marked X3 dated 14/10/2004, and the order

marked X2 dated 14/10/2004 would not apply to vehicles

imported on a date prior to 20th October 2004.

c) Make order declaring that orders made under fiscal statistics (sic)

imposing taxes take effect upon the order being made and signed by

the minister in accordance with the law.

11 SC/APPEAL/11/2006

d) Issue an Interim Order restraining the 1st Respondent from claiming

or demanding that the rates of duty that existed prior to 15/10/2004

apply to it.

e) Issue an Interim Order restraining the 1st Respondent and/any

importer from claiming that the rates of duty that existed prior to

15/10/2004 would apply in respect of goods that were imported on

or before 15/10/2004 do not apply to those imports.

f) Make order declaring that the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are empowered

to apply the relevant rates of duty based on the time of removal from

the Warehouse or other place at which such excisable article was

stored immediately after its importation in to Sri Lanka, as required

by Section 5 (1) (b) of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act No:13 at

1989 as amended.

In the first place, if the Minister who was the original 1st respondent did

not wish to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the

original 2nd and 3rd respondents who respectively published and

implemented the Ministers Order cannot practically appeal against the

judgment of Court of Appeal. This defect cannot be cured by filing an

amended caption in the year 2022 by also naming the Minister an

appellant.

In any event, the original 2nd and 3rd respondents only seek to Set aside

that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which holds that the order

marked X3 dated 14/10/2004, and the order marked X2 dated

14/10/2004 would not apply to vehicles imported on a date prior to 20th

October 2004. X2 and X3 are not Gazettes. The adverse observations

made by the Court of Appeal are against the Gazettes, in particular, the

date of publication of the Gazettes, not against Notifications or Orders.

Both parties are confused and the Court of Appeal too was confused. I

had to take several dates to understand the issues.

12 SC/APPEAL/11/2006

In the argument, the learned ASG submitted that subsequent to the

delivery of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Parliament passed the

Protection of Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act No. 1 of 2006

to be effective from 01.01.2004, and according to sections 3 and 4 of the

Act, read with the Schedule to the Act, the judgment of the Court of

Appeal will have no bearing on the collection of revenue, as what is

decisive is not the date of publication but the date of the Order of the

Minister. This Court, in this action, cannot make a formal

pronouncement on that matter.

This appeal, as presently constituted, cannot be maintained. There is no

necessity to answer the questions of law. I dismiss the appeal but without

costs.
