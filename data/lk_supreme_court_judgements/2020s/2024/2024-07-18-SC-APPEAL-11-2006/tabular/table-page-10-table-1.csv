"M
inister’s  Order  marked  X3  was  Gazetted  in  the  Gazette  marked  X5,"
"which  is  not  correct.  The  relevant  Gazette  was  X11,  tendered  with  the"
"counter affidavit. The Court of Appeal did not state anything  regarding"
"X11."
"If the petitioner contends and the Court of Appeal too thinks that what"
"matters is the date of publication of the Gazette, not the date of the Order"
"of the Minister, there is no material to establish the actual publication of"
"the Gazettes."
"Although  the  said  observations  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  are  against  the"
"Minister,  the  Minister  did  not  seek  special  leave  to  appeal  from  the"
"judgment of the Court of Appeal, but only the Secretary to the Treasury"
"(the  original  2nd  respondent)  and  the  Director  General  of  Customs  (the"
"original 3rd respondent) sought special leave to appeal from this Court by"
"petition dated 02.12.2005. This is what the said two respondents (as the"
"1st and 2nd petitioners) sought from this Court:"
"WHEREFORE  the  1st  and  2nd  Petitioners  respectively  pray  that  Your"
"Lordships’ Court be pleased to:"
