"","complaint  that  was  sent,  recorded  statements  from  the  officers  of"
"","media organizations which broadcasted the press conference, and had"
"","also  recorded  statements 
from  the  public  who  had  watched  the"
"","broadcast.  The  4th  respondent  states  that  he  had  also  submitted  a"
"","report on the progress of the investigation to the 3rd respondent. This"
"","particular report however, has not been produced before this Court."
"41.  When ascertaining as to whether reasonable grounds existed for the",""
"","arrest to be carried out, it is important to consider the case of  Sita"
"","Gunasekara V. A.T. De Fonseka and 2 others 55 NLR 246, which"
"","was  concerning  an  arrest  made  under  emergency  regulations.  That"
"","case also deals with the issue of ascertaining ‘reasonable grounds for"
"","suspecting the commission of an offence’. In Sita Gunasekara (supra),"
"","the Superintendent had informed the ASP to carry out the arrest. It"
"","was stated that, it  was the superintendent and not the ASP himself"
"","who suspected that the petitioner had been concerned in an offence"
"","under  emergency  regulations.  It  was  stated  that,  “…an  officer  who"
"","arrests  a  person  suspected  of  an  offence  must  himself  entertain  the"
"","suspicion”"
"42.","The facts of the above case are quite distinct to the case at hand. In"
"","the above case, the ASP carried out the arrest without conducting any"
"","inquiries  and  seemingly  without  entertaining  suspicion.  However,"
"","when considering the case at hand, the 4th respondent had recorded"
"","statements from the officers of media organizations which broadcasted"
"","the  press  conference,  had  also  recorded  statements  from  the  public"
"","and had himself carried out the investigations.  It is vital to note that,"
"","as  explained  in  Sita  Gunasekara(supra),  the  ‘reasonable  suspicion’"
"","must be entertained subjectively."
"43.  However,  in  the  case  of  RTLA  Weerawansa  V.  Attorney  General",""
"","[2000]  1  SLR  387  which  dealt  with  an  arrest  and  detention  made"
"","under the PTA, His Lordship Fernando J. stated that,"
"","“… not only must the Minister of Defense subjectively have the required"
"","belief or suspicion, but there must also be objectively, reason for such"
"","belief.”"
"44.  When considering the case of Weerawansa(supra) the burden is on the",""
"","4th respondent to prove that he had subjectively formed the required"
"","suspicion before carrying out the arrest of the petitioner. Additionally,"
"","he must also prove that there was objectively reason for such belief."
