"55.","According  to  P-8,  the  5th  respondent  had  stated  that,  the  petitioner"
"","has  been  taken  into  custody  due  to  his  involvement  in  the  Easter"
"","Sunday  Attacks.  However,  the  receipt  of  arrest  does  not  mention"
"","anything in relation to the Easter Sunday Attacks or in relation to the"
"","destruction of a Buddha Statue. There is no objection filed by the 5th"
"","respondent denying the statements in the documents P-7 and P-8 nor"
"","has he denied making such statements."
"56.","When considering the statements of the 5th respondent in P-7, and the"
"","subsequent  arrest  that  was  carried  out, 
it 
is  clear  that  the  5th"
"","respondent  had  caused  the  arrest  of  the  petitioner.  Thereby  the"
"","fundamental  rights  guaranteed  to  the  petitioner  in  terms  of  Article"
"","13(1) has been violated by the acts of the 5th respondent as well."
"","Alleged Violation of Article 13(2) of the Constitution."
"57.","The second position taken up by the learned President’s Counsel for"
"","the petitioner was that the detention order which was issued in respect"
"","of the petitioner was illegal."
"58.","It was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that, there"
"","had been no disclosure of the material upon which the detention order"
"","[P-5] had been issued. It was submitted that, the obligation was on the"
"","respondents  to  disclose  the  reasons  for  the  issuance  of  the  said"
"","detention  order.  In  support  of  his  position,  the  learned  President’s"
"","Counsel cited the case of Weerawansa V. Attorney General [2000]"
"","1  SLR  387  at  page  403  where  the  detention  order  was  said  to  be"
"","invalid  as  no  material  justifying  a  reasonable  suspicion  of  unlawful"
"","activity  had  been  placed.  It  was  emphasized  that,  there  must  be"
"","material placed before His Excellency the President for the exercise of"
"","that discretion."
"59.","The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  submitted 
further 
that, 
the  4th"
"","respondent in his objections has only stated that “a detention order"
"","was  obtained”  and  no  material  regarding  by  whom  such  order  was"
"","obtained, or on what material such order was obtained has not been"
"","disclosed. Since there has been no material before His Excellency the"
"","President, the learned President’s Counsel submits that the detention"
"","order has been issued mechanically."
