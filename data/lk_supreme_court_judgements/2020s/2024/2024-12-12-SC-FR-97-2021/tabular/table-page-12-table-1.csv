"45.","This Court is very well aware that what is to be determined is whether"
"","there  existed  material  to  entertain  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the"
"","petitioner was concerned or connected  with any unlawful activity at"
"","the  time  of  arrest  of  the  petitioner.  This  Court  will  only  look  at  the"
"","status quo at the time the arrest of the petitioner was made."
"46.  Accordingly, when considering the transcript of the press conference",""
"","[P-2(b)]  in  its  entirety,  there  seems  to  be  nothing  to  the  effect  that"
"","creates  or  instigate  hatred  or  propagate  communal  violence.  It  is  in"
"","fact on ethnic harmony rather than to the contrary. A plain reading of"
"","the 
transcript 
[P-2(b)]  does  not  objectively  create 
‘a 
reasonable"
"","suspicion’."
"47.  Statements that were made at the press conference stripped out of its",""
"","context  is  not  sufficient  to  create  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the"
"","petitioner has committed an unlawful activity, or offences under the"
"","PTA  as  stipulated  in  the  receipt  of  arrest.  The  4th  respondent  in  his"
"","objections  take  up  the  position  that  he  had  formed  the  necessary"
"","reasonable  suspicion  by  recording  statements  from  the  officers  of"
"","media organizations which broadcasted the said press conference and"
"","persons 
from  the  public  who  had  watched  the  broadcast 
[4R5]."
"","However,  on  an  objective  standard,  there  seems  to  be  no  sufficient"
"","material 
to 
form  a 
‘reasonable  suspicion’ 
that 
the  petitioner 
is"
"","connected  with  or  concerned  in  any  unlawful  activity.  The  learned"
"","Magistrate in his order dated 14.09.2021 has found that the speech"
"","(statement) made by the petitioner in its entirety was to promulgate"
"","ethnic harmony and was not to promote ethnic violence. The learned"
"","High  Court  Judge 
in  his 
judgment  dated  02.12.2021  has  also"
"","concluded that the prosecution has failed to prove that the statement"
"","made by the petitioner was to create ethnic or religious disharmony."
"48.  Further, it is also noted that, in the B-report 4R8, the CID has stated",""
"","that the arrest of the petitioner was carried out on the  advice of the"
"","Hon. Attorney General. This position is denied by the learned ASG for"
"","the respondents. The CID has clearly included a false assertion in the"
"","B-report [4R8] in order to carry out the arrest of the petitioner. This"
"","shows malice on the part of the CID."
"49.","Therefore,  neither  the  3rd  respondent,  nor  the  4th  respondent  have"
"","satisfied that there was a reasonable suspicion that the petitioner was"
"","concerned or connected with any unlawful activity. Further, they have"
"","also acted with malice in carrying out the arrest of the petitioner."
