"31.  Citing  the  case  of  Dissanayake  V.  Superintendent  of  Mahara",""
"","Prisons  [1991]  2  SLR  249  the  learned  ASG  for  the  respondents"
"","submitted that, it is well settled that the validity of arrest is determined"
"","by applying the objective test. This is the case whether the arrest was"
"","carried  out  under  the  normal  law,  under  emergency  regulations  or"
"","under PTA."
"32.","It was submitted by the learned ASG that, on the available material, it"
"","is not the duty of the Court to determine if the arrest should have been"
"","made or not, but the question for Court is to determine whether there"
"","was material for a reasonable officer to cause such arrest. He asserts"
"","that in deciding this, the proof of the commission of the offence is not"
"","required and that a reasonable suspicion or reasonable complaint of"
"","the commission of the offence would suffice. It was submitted that the"
"","petitioner  was  arrested  on  reasonable  grounds  based  on  strong  and"
"","cogent evidence elicited."
"33.","It was further submitted by the learned ASG for the respondents that,"
"","as mentioned in the B-Report [4R8] the CID has sought the advice of"
"","the Attorney General before proceeding to arrest the petitioner. It was"
"","submitted  that, 
in  such  an 
instance,  the  Attorney  General  only"
"","determines  if  there  is  a  prima  facie  violation  of  a  Penal  Provision."
"","Thereafter, it is the discretion of the investigating agency to arrest the"
"","offender on the basis of reasonable suspicion. However, at the hearing"
"","of  this  application,  the  learned  ASG  submitted  that  the  Attorney"
"","General never advised to arrest the petitioner."
