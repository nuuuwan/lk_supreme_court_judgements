"27.  With regard to the arrest that was carried out, it was the position of",""
"","the learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner that the arrest that"
"","was carried out was unreasonable, illegal and unfounded."
"28.","The learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the"
"","document 3R1 through which the 3rd respondent had authorized six"
"","officers to carry out the arrest of the petitioner is a deficient document"
"","as there is no proper delegation in terms of section 6(1) of the PTA. It"
"","was  his  submission  that,  section  6(1)  of  the  PTA  empowers  the"
"","conferment  of 
the  specific  power  of  arrest  upon 
‘a 
reasonable"
"","suspicion’,  however, 
the  document  3R1  does  not 
refer 
to  any"
"","conferment  of  a  power  to  arrest.  It  simply  says  “to  perform  all  acts"
"","specified  in  this  Act  in  connection  with  the  terrorist  activities  of  the"
"","petitioner”. Further, the document 3R1 doesn’t specify any particular"
"","offence or state that the petitioner is reasonably suspected of having"
"","committed any offence."
"29.  Furthering  on","the 
issue  of 
reasonable 
suspicion, 
the 
learned"
"","President’s Counsel in his written submissions cited the case of Sita"
"","Gunasekara V. A.T. De Fonseka and 2 others 55 NLR 246 which"
"","dealt  with  a  regulation  in  similar  terms  framed  under  the  Public"
"","Security Ordinance. The learned President’s Counsel submitted that,"
"","in Gunasekara(supra) it was held that, the person who authorizes such"
"","an arrest must as a condition precedent himself, form the opinion that"
"","the  suspect  was  reasonably  suspected  of  committing  a  declared"
"","offence. It was submitted by the learned President’s Counsel that 3R1"
"","does not indicate that the 3rd respondent had made such an opinion"
"","and  that  neither  the  3rd  respondent  nor  the  4th  respondent  in  their"
"","objections  have  disclosed  any  reasons  or  material  on  which  they"
"","arrived at the reasonable suspicion to arrest the petitioner."
"30.","The  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  (ASG)  for  the  respondents"
"","cited the case of Weerawansa V. The Attorney General and Others"
"","[2000] 1 SLR 387 where it was stated that, it is well settled law that"
"","there has to be a reasonable suspicion of an unlawful activity which"
"","arose  on  the  basis  of  the  complaint  and  it  should  be  in  accordance"
"","with section 6(1) PTA.  His Lordship Fernando J. further commented"
"","that,  not  only  must  the  Minister  of  Defense  subjectively  have  the"
"","required belief or suspicion, but there must also be objectively, reason"
"","for  such  belief.  It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  ASG  that  the"
"","respondents  in  this  case  had  followed  the  relevant  provisions  of  the"
"","PTA.  The  respondents  maintain  that  the  comments  made  by  the"
"","petitioner at the press conference were vicious."
