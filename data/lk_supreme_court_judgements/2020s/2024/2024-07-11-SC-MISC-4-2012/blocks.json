Therefore, this Court would not in the course of the judgment endeavor to make a finding as to the title. In view of the above, learned Counsel for all the parties agree that only remaining issue to be adjudicated by this Court is whether the 3rd and 4th Respondents had the legal authority to revoke the licence already granted in view of the provision in section 15(8) of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act.\u201d Case for the Appellants",

This licence conferred on the Appellants legal authority to mine for gems in the land \u201cThumbaliyadde\u201d. On or about 6th and 23rd January 2012 the 1st Respondent \u2013 the Chief Incumbent of the Sri Padasthanaya presented to the 2nd Respondent, letters (\u201cX5a\u201d and \u201cX5b\u201d) stating that he was the Viharadhipathi of the Sri Padasthanaya and objecting to the issue of the afore-stated licence to the three Appellants on the footing that the land \u201cThumbaliyadde\u201d was a property of the Sri Padasthanaya. In the circumstances, the 2nd Respondent conducted an inquiry into the matter. Following the conduct of the inquiry, the 2nd Respondent decided to revoke the licence previously issued to the Appellants. The decision of the 2nd Respondent was conveyed to the Appellants by the 3rd Respondent \u2013 Chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Authority by letter dated 27th February 2012 (\u201cX8\u201d). The premise upon which the 2nd Respondent took the decision to revoke the licence was that the title to the land \u201cThumbaliyadde\u201d was vested with the Sri Padasthanaya and not with the Appellants. Therefore, it was the view of the 2nd Respondent that the Appellants did not have a legal entitlement to obtain a licence to mine for gems on the land \u201cThumbaliyadde\u201d.",

Consequent thereto, the 2nd Respondent has conducted an inquiry, and had decided to cancel the licence (\u201cX3\u201d). That decision has been conveyed to the Appellants by letter dated 27th February 2012 (\u201cX8\u201d). In the said letter, the 3rd Respondent writing on behalf of the 2nd Respondent has stated that, an examination of the material submitted by the 1st Respondent and the Appellants, submissions made on their behalf and documentation called for from the National Archives examined by the inquiring officer had revealed that, the land \u2018Thumbaliyadde\u2019 belonged to the Sri Padasthanaya. Furthermore, inquiries had revealed that this land had been vested in the Sri Padasthanaya by a Sannasa, and that document marked \u2018L.9\u2019 tendered by the Appellants in supposed proof of their ownership, had in it a forgery. It is sequel to the conveying of this decision, that the Appellants had appealed to the 4th Respondent \u2013 Secretary to the Ministry of Environment and thereafter to this Court. 26.

    "text": "\u201cThe general rule, that a decision affecting the rights of an individual cannot be revoked without his consent, is obviously in the interests of the individual. But there can be situations in which the administration has a legitimate interest in revoking such a decision. For instance, the administration may discover that its original decision was illegal or based on incorrect facts. Again, if subsequently the facts change or the administration changes its policy, it may have strong reasons for wanting to revoke a decision which it regards as incompatible with the new facts or the new policy. \u2026 When an administrative body is empowered to determine whether an individual has a pre-existing legal right, it is performing the same type of function as a court performs. \u2026 But different considerations apply when an administrative body is empowered to confer on an individual a benefit which he would not otherwise have possessed. Here, the administrative body is exercising a discretionary power. There is a presumption of statutory interpretation that \u2018a discretionary power may be exercised from time to time unless a contrary intention appears\u2019 and it would seem to follow that the administrative body therefore has the power of \u2018reviewing its decisions from time to time\u2019. An administrative body cannot fetter the future exercise of its discretionary power by making an administrative decision, just as it cannot fetter the future exercise of its discretionary powers by making a contract. The fact that an administrative body has implied power to revoke certain types of decision does not mean that it has an unlimited power to revoke such decisions. An implied power to revoke is normally a discretionary power, and it is settled law that a decision taken under a discretionary power will be invalid if the decision-maker disregarded relevant considerations. In deciding whether to revoke its previous decision, a public authority should always take into account the interests of the",

The public interests in favour of revocation must be weighed against the private interests of the beneficiary, and revocation outweigh the private interests of the beneficiary. \u2026 The balance between public interests and private interests will vary so much from case to case that it is impossible to give an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which an implied power to revoke can be exercised.
