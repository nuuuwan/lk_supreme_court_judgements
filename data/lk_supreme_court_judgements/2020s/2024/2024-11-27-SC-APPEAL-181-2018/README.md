A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. The pithy question for determination in this case is whether a prior

mortgage bond can extend its ambit to secure the repayment of a loan

granted by a bank subsequent to its execution. It is a well-established

principle that a security, such as a mortgage, typically secures both past

and present liabilities. However, the inquiry is whether such a security

can validly encompass a contingent liability. Given the facts in the instant

appeal, can a mortgage bond executed in 2015 serve as security for a loan

advanced by the same bank in 2016?

2. This issue draws attention to the intricate and often labyrinthine clauses

embedded in standard form mortgage bonds. The ingenuity of their

construction serves as a testament to the protective mechanisms that

favor financial institutions. Indeed, one might be inclined to echo Lord

Page 4 of 21

Macnaghten's observation that "no oneby the light of nature ever

understood an English mortgage of real estate."1

3. The Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Defendant" or

the "Commercial Bank") extended banking facilities to the Plaintiff-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Plaintiff"). To secure the

resulting indebtedness, the Plaintiff executed two mortgage bonds,

numbered 2710 and 2711, on 25th August, 2010.

4. The mortgage bond bearing No.2710 hypothecated the properties known

as Heeressagala and Richmond Hill, while the mortgage bond No.2711

pledged the property known as Averihena to the bank.

5. A common feature of both mortgage bonds is the Plaintiffs promisean

undertaking universally included in security documents. Specifically, the

Plaintiff expressly covenanted, agreed, and bound itself to the Defendant

Bank to repay, on demand, all sums that may become due, owing, or

payable at any time or from time to time in connection with any banking

facilities extended by the Defendant. This obligation encompassed the

repayment of interest at such rates as may be determined by the

Defendant Bank in the ordinary course of its business. This is the pith

and substance of the covenants in the two mortgage bonds that demand

consideration.

6. Due to a failure to repay the periodic dues owed to the bank, the Board of

Directors of the Commercial Bank passed a resolution authorizing the

1 Samuel v Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corporation (1904) AC 323, at p.326.

Page 5 of 21

sale of the mortgaged properties described in the schedules to the plaint

and the schedules to the mortgage bonds. The sale was to be conducted

pursuant to the provisions of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended) (the Act) to recover the

monies outstanding on the banking facilities extended to the Plaintiff

from time to time.

7. It appears that the Commercial Bank (the Defendant) complied with the

procedure outlined in the Act, including the issuance of notice regarding

the board resolution. A quick examination of paragraphs [7] to [9] of the

plaint and the response in paragraphs [3(s)] to [3(z)] of the statement of

objections makes it clear that, despite receiving notice of the board

resolution, the Plaintiff failed to take any action to settle the outstanding

amounts under the specified banking facilities.

8. Some facts germane to the case warrant recapitulation. It remains

undisputed that the Plaintiff has failed to liquidate the amounts owed

under the terms of the aforesaid board resolution.

9. Against this backdrop, the Plaintiff instituted the present action, seeking,

inter alia, an enjoining order and an interim injunction to restrain the sale

of the mortgaged properties in question.

10. As is typical in cases of this nature, the Defendant Bank filed its

statement of objections on 21st September 2017, opposing the issuance

of the interim injunction sought in the Plaintiff's prayer to the plaint. The

inquiry into the interim injunction was resolved through written

Page 6 of 21

submissions. By an order dated 15th November 2017, the learned Judge

of the Commercial High Court granted the interim injunction. It is this

order that is now challenged before this Court.

11. The progression of the case in this Court has given rise to the following

questions of law on which leave was granted.

1. Has the learned judge of the High Court erred in overlooking the fact

that, by the mortgage bonds admittedly executed by the Respondent

in favour of the Petitioner Bank, the Respondent has expressly agreed

and undertook to repay to the Petitioner Bank, on demand, all monies

which are due and owing upon all and any banking facility granted by

the Petitioner Bank to the Respondents;

2. Has the Learned High Court judge failed to appreciate the fact that the

aforesaid mortgage bonds annexed to the statement of objections

marked as D1 and D2 were common securities for all the banking

facilities granted by the Petitioner in terms of the letter of offer

marked as A1;

3. Furthermore, has the learned High Court judge failed to appreciate the

fact that the rate of interest charged in the final letter of demand

marked "A8" by which the Petitioner Bank demanded payment upon

the aforesaid mortgage bonds and the notices marked A10 to A13

is the same rate of interest. (14.52% per centum per annum and

15.52% per centum per annum) and the said interests are charged

from 20th January 2017 on the respective capital balances of the

respective Loans (Rs. 10,000,000/- and Rs.8,200,000/-).

Page 7 of 21

Order by the Commercial High Court Judge dated 15th November 2017

12. The learned judge of the Commercial High Court granted the interim

injunction principally on the following premises:

a) By looking at D1 and D2 (mortgage bonds) and E1 and E2 (S.47A

declarations of waiver), it is clear that the mortgage bonds have not been

executed to secure payment of the term loan facilities referred to in the

board resolution (Rs. 8,200,000/- and Rs. 10,000,000/-) but regarding

two different loan facilities in a sum of Rs. 5,500,000/- and

Rs.8,200,000/- respectively;

b) In terms of the last three lines of the second paragraph (sic) of the first

page of E1 (the declaration of waiver for mortgage bond No. 2710) which

says that the property was mortgaged "to secure the repayment of the sum

of Rupees Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Only (Rs. 5,500.000/-) lent

and advanced to us by the said Bank" and the last three lines of the second

paragraph (sic) of the first page of E2 (the declaration of waiver for

mortgage bond No. 2711) which says that the property was mortgaged

to secure the repayment of the sum of Rupees Eight Million Two Hundred

Thousand Only (Rs. 8,200,000/-) lent and advanced to us by the said Bank"

13. Essentially, the Commercial Bank has preferred this appeal to challenge

the issuance of the interim injunction granted by the learned High Court

judge, which has effectively halted the parate execution of the properties

mortgaged to the bank.

Page 8 of 21

14. The crux of the learned High Court judge's reasoning is that the two

mortgage bonds executed in favor of the Commercial Bank, namely Nos.

2710 and 2711, do not extend to secure the repayment of the

restructured advances amounting to Rs. 10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten

Million), which were subsequently granted in the year 2016.

15. To evaluate and determine the correctness of the proposition advanced

by the learned Commercial High Court judge, it is imperative to examine

the original loans granted by the Commercial Bank to the Defendant in

2015 in relation to the subsequent loan granted in 2016, and to assess

whether the latter falls within the scope of the security provided by the

earlier mortgage bonds.

Original loans advanced in 2015

16. As regards the mortgages referred to above, the letter of offer dated 24th

August 2015 extended to the Plaintiff, a customer of the Commercial

Bank, a financial facility amounting to Rs. 5,500,000/- (Rupees Five

Million and Five Hundred Thousand). The Plaintiff accepted this offer and

executed a floating primary mortgage bond, No. 2710, to secure

repayment of this sum. Additionally, a second loan facility of Rs.

8,200,000/- (Rupees Eight Million and Two Hundred Thousand) was

granted and secured by a separate floating primary mortgage bond, No.

2711. Both mortgage bonds were executed on 25th August 2015.

Page 9 of 21

17. The relationship between these two loans and the respective mortgage

bonds securing their repayment is illustrated for clarity in the diagrams

given below.

Loan and Mortgage Bond Relationships

Loan 1

Amount: Rs. 5,500,000/- (Rupees Five Million and Five Hundred

Thousand)

Date of Loan: 24th August 2015

Secured by: Floating Primary Mortgage Bond No. 2710

Date of Execution of the above mortgage bond: 25th August 2015

Loan 2

Amount: Rs. 8,200,000/- (Rupees Eight Million and Two Hundred

Thousand)

Date of Loan: 24th August 2015

Secured by: Floating Primary Mortgage Bond No. 2711

Date of Execution of the above mortgage bond: 25th August 2015.

18. The loans, designated as Loan 1 and Loan 2 above, are best illustrated by

the following diagrams Figure I and Figure II, which depict the

relationship between the loans and the corresponding mortgage

arrangements.

Restructuring of loans in 2016

19. In the year 2016, another letter of offer dated 22nd September 2016

proposed to restructure the previously granted loans in the following

manner

An overdraft facility

Rs. 4,750,000/- (Rupees Four Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand

only)

A Structured term loan facility

Rs. 10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million only)

A Term loan facility

Rs. 8,200,000/- (Rupees Eight Million and Two Hundred Thousand only)

20. It should be noted that when the rescheduled term loan of Rs.

10,000,000/- was established in 2016, the overdraft facility of Rs.

4,750,000/- and the term loan facility of Rs. 8,200,000/-, both originating

in 2015, remained in esse. This conclusion is reached upon reviewing the

offer letters in the case.

21. The Commercial Bank offered the borrower company the aforesaid sum

of Rs. 10,000,000/- in 2016 to settle the outstanding dues on the

revolving short-term loans previously obtained by the Plaintiff. This

appears to be a new financial advance, while the liabilities under the

overdraft facility of Rs. 4,750,000/- and the term loan facility of Rs.

8,200,000/- continued to grow by 2016.

Page 12 of 21

22. It is important to note that the loan of Rs. 10,000,000/-(Rupees Ten

Million), offered to the Plaintiff in 2016 as a restructured loan, does not

specify any particular mortgage bond securing its repayment.

Furthermore, it must be emphasized that this restructured loan,

advanced in 2016, was granted well after the mortgage bonds were

executed in 2015.

23. The quintessential question before this Court is whether the restructured

loan of Rs. 10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million) which came into existence in

2016 would be secured by the previous mortgage bonds executed in the

2015.

24. The learned Commercial High Court judge holds that the amount of Rs.

10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million), not being specifically mentioned in

the prior mortgage bonds of 2015, is not secured by either of these bonds.

Therefore, the immovable properties mortgaged under the prior

mortgage bonds (Nos.2710 and 2711) of 2015 cannot be subjected to

parate execution to recover the restructured loan granted in 2016 - so

holds the learned Commercial High Court judge.

25. Thus, the question before us is whether the above mortgage bonds Nos.

2710 and 2711 would serve as security for the latter loan of Rs.

10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million).

26. The learned judge of the Commercial High Court has held otherwise

because the restructured loan of Rs. 10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million)

is nowhere specified in the previous bonds nor is it mentioned in the

Page 13 of 21

declarations of waiver executed under S.47A in relation to these

mortgage bonds.

27. It must be emphasized that the restructured loan of 2016 cannot be

reflected in the mortgage bonds of 2015 or the associated declarations of

waiver, as the loan was advanced at a later point in time. The appropriate

question is not whether the mortgage bonds explicitly reference the

exact amount of the subsequent loan, but whether their terms encompass

the borrowers liability for future advances. This critical question was

overlooked by the Commercial High Court judge. Had it been addressed;

the answer would have been evident from several clauses consistently

included in both mortgage bonds.

28. Both mortgage bonds, Nos. 2710 and 2711, include similarly drafted

clauses that the learned Commercial High Court judge overlooked before

issuing the interim injunction. Specifically, Clauses (e) and (g)(3) of

mortgage bond No. 2711 represent the standard practice of financial

institutions to safeguard their interests. The earlier bond, No. 2710,

contains identical language to the clauses detailed below.

Clause (e) of Bond No.2711

All and every the sums and sum of money which now are or is

or which shall or may at any time from time to time and at all times

hereafter be or become due owing and payable to the Bank by

obligor/s upon or in respect of all loans advances or payments

whatsoever which may at any time from time to time and at all times

hereafter be made by the Bank to or for the use or accommodation

Page 14 of 21

benefit or on account of the obligor/s and upon or in respect of any

account or accounts transaction/transactions whatsoever between

the obligor/s and the Bank.

Clause (g)(3) of Bond No.2711

That these presents shall be a continuing security to the

Bank for all and every the sums and sum of money which now are

or is or which shall or may at any time and from time to time and at

all times hereafter be or become due owing and payable by the

obligor/s to the Bank under by virtue or in respect of or secured by

these present notwithstanding that the amount of such sums or sum

of money may from time to time vary or be reduced or fluctuate or be

repaid in full and that fresh liabilities shall be incurred after the

obligor/s he ceased to be indebted to the Bank it being intended that

the total amount of moneys hereby secured shall not exceed Rupees

Eight Million Two Hundred Thousand Only (Rs.8,200,000/-) of lawful

money of Sri Lanka the security hereby created being intended to

cover the final balance of accounts between the obligor/s of the one

part and the Bank other part in respect of all transactions and

dealings such final balance not to exceed in whole the sum of

Rupees Eight Million Two Hundred Thousand Only

(Rs.8,200,000/-) and interest thereon at Average Weighted Prime

Lending Rate Plus Three (AWPLR+3%) p.a. per centum per annum.

29. The above clauses clearly indicate the possibility of banks advancing

funds in the future, even long after the execution of the mortgage bond.

Specifically, the two clauses in mortgage bond No. 2711 establish that the

Page 15 of 21

security provided (in this case, the Averihena property mortgaged under

bond No. 2711) is liable to be bound and sold in execution to recover not

only the outstanding dues and interest on the original loan of Rs.

8,200,000/- but also any future and contingent advances currently due

and payable to the bank. Notably, the clauses impose a deliberate cap on

the amount recoverable by the bank, namely Rs. 8,200,000/- along with

interest at the specified rate.

Whole Monies or Debt Clauses

30. Pagets Law of Banking (Fifteenth Edition, 2018) highlights the

efficacy of such clauses as follows:2

A common situation would be where a bank allows a customer

to increase his overdraft on a current account. This is usually referred

to as lending on a fluctuating account because the balance on the

account is going to be changing constantly as money flows in and out.

Another common situation would be where a borrower draws down

on an existing facility within the limit of that facility.

A preliminary point to be addressed is a simple one of

construction. This applies whether or not the land is registered. It is

necessary to decide exactly what the original mortgage secures. It is

not uncommon to have in a mortgage a definition of the secured

sums' and to find that they are defined as the amounts due to the

lender on a particular account or under a particular loan agreement.

2 page 479.

Page 16 of 21

Clearly, such a mortgage is not going to secure amounts advanced on

an entirely different account or under a different loan agreement.

Equally clearly, there are going to be difficulties if the identified

account is closed or the original loan agreement is amended.

The security which a lender takes from a corporate

customer will usually address the issue by defining the secured

sums very widely so as to include all monies due from the

customer to the lender on any account, whatsoever, whether as

principal or as surety and will include all costs, charges and

commission. This is commonly known as an 'all-monies charge".

31. Both the clauses I have culled out from the mortgage bonds can be

properly called all-monies charge or all debts' clauses which are

common in contracts of both guarantee and mortgage.

32. These clauses, which are also known as 'all accounts', 'all obligations', 'all

monies', 'all moneys', and (particularly in the United States) dragnet'

clauses, are intended to ensure that the party providing the mortgage or

guarantee will be liable for all sums owed by the debtor or other

nominated party to the creditor. To ensure adequate coverage of all

eventualities, clauses of this nature are generally drawn

comprehensively.

Page 17 of 21

Continuing Security

33. Clause (g) (3) also classifies the security as a continuing security and the

significance of such a classification is unmistakably evident. If a mortgage

is not expressed to be a continuing security, it may be construed as

covering only a specific transaction where the liability of the mortgagor

may reduce by payments in. Where there is a facility under which the

principal debtor's liability fluctuates because sums are credited and

debited to an account from time to time (subject usually to a given limit),

such as an overdraft facility on a current account, or sums advanced

under a factoring or invoice discounting facility, provision must be made

in the security to ensure that the mortgagors liability does not come to

an end when the balance of the account is repaid, or else sums which the

mortgagor later draws down may not be covered. A continuing security

clause achieves this by providing that the mortgage shall remain a

continuing security for the mortgagors obligations to the creditor at any

time and that it shall not be satisfied or otherwise affected by any

repayment from time to time of the whole or part of the sums due and

owing,

34. Thus, the mortgage bonds executed in 2015 would secure not only

moneys owing upon the security but also money due upon future

advances that become payable on demand. En passant, I would pinpoint

Section 64 (1) of the Mortgage Act that renders a mortgage given to

secure future advance valid and effective.

Page 18 of 21

35. I further hold that the mortgage bonds in this case are not explicitly

limited to covering payments under or pursuant to the 2015 offer letter.

The mortgagor's liability is not confined to the initial tranche of financial

advances. The scope of the mortgage bonds of 2015 is broad enough to

encompass contingent and future liabilities. Consequently, the loanor

the restructured term loan issued in 2016falls within the ambit of the

'all monies' clauses of the two mortgage bonds, even without specific

reference to any individual mortgage bond.

36. The Commercial High Court judge overlooked the key features of the

mortgage bonds and erred in restraining the parate execution of the

properties securing repayment of the subsequent loan of Rs.

10,000,000/- despite the bonds explicitly and unequivocally permitting

such a course of action. Accordingly, this Court will set aside the order of

the Commercial High Court dated 15.11.2017, as it is based on the

incorrect premise that the loan of Rs. 10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million)

granted in 2016 is not covered by the mortgage bonds.

37. Before I part with the judgment, a caveat requires to be sounded in

permitting any parate execution based on the resolution before Court. It

is important to note that while the mortgage bonds serve as continuing

securities, securing past, present, and future advances that are due and

owing, their enforceability is subject to the condition that the total debts

sought to be enforced do not exceed Rs. 5,500,000/- and Rs. 8,200,000/-

respectively, as stipulated in the individual mortgage bonds.

Page 19 of 21

38. There was a clear mutual intention at the time of executing the individual

mortgage bonds that the total debt (whole debt) enforceable by the bank

by virtue of the mortgage bonds would be capped at Rs. 5,500,000/- and

Rs. 8,200,000/- respectively, even though the liabilities of the Plaintiff

Respondent owed to the bank may be higher. Clause (e) of bond No. 2711,

as cited above, exemplifies this intention, stating that ......such final

balance not to exceed in whole the sum of Rupees Eight Million Two

Hundred Thousand Only (Rs. 8,200,000/-) and interest thereon.. In

the context of guarantees which contained whole debt clauses but with a

cap on total liability, English case law illustrate the intention of parties

not to cover certain types of liabilities - see Investec Bank (UK) Ltd v

Zulman3 and Barclays Bank v Caldwell.4

39. In the latter case, Barclays Bank issued a side letter confirming that,

despite the guarantee's "all monies" scope, it would apply only to the "top

70,000" of the debtor's overdraft facility. The Court held the guarantee

unenforceable because it was executed in terms that did not evidence this

agreement, thereby failing to comply with Section 4 of the Statute of

Frauds 1677, which requires that the terms of a guarantee be evidenced

in a note or memorandum signed by the guarantor.

40. In the end, I must emphasize the importance of mortgage bonds that

guarantee the repayment of all monies currently or at any time owed to

the bank in respect of advances and accommodations granted to the

borrower (mortgagor), provided that the liability of the mortgaged

3 (2009) EWHC 1590 (Comm).

4 Unreported, 25 July 1986 (Harman J)

Page 20 of 21

property is capped at a specified amount. This critical feature cannot be

overlooked. The upshot of all this is that a board resolution of a bank

seeking to enforce a liability exceeding the capped limit specified in the

mortgage bond would render such enforcement actionable, as the excess

liability beyond the cap has to be enforced by other appropriate means

of recovery.

41. This principle must be kept in mind as the Commercial High Court

resumes the trial following the remand of the case to its jurisdiction.

42. The Court proceeds to answer the questions of law formulated in this

Court as follows;

1. Yes, but all moneys which are due and owing upon all

and any banking facility can be enforced subject to the

limitation imposed by the mortgage bonds on liability.

2. Insofar as the two mortgage bonds were continuing

securities, they would encompass the banking facilities

granted by the Commercial Bank in terms of the letter of

offer dated 22.09.2016.

3. As the learned Commercial High Court judge has left the

question of interest to be examined and determined at

the trial, it is premature to answer this question of law.

Page 21 of 21

43. Accordingly, this Court sets aside the order of the Commercial High Court

dated 15th November 2017 as regards the issuance of the interim

injunction and allows the appeal of the Defendant Appellant. I reiterate

that this judgement only sets aside the interim injunction issued by the

Commercial High Court. Thus, this Court directs that the trial of this

action be continued and concluded as expeditiously as possible.
