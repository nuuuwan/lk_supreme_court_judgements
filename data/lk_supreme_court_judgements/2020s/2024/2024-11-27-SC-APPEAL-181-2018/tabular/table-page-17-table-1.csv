"Continuing Security"
"33. Clause (g) (3) also classifies the security as a continuing security and the"
"significance of such a classification is unmistakably evident. If a mortgage"
"is  not  expressed  to  be  a  continuing  security,  it  may  be  construed  as"
"covering only a specific transaction where the liability of the mortgagor"
"may reduce by payments in.  Where there is a facility under which the"
"principal  debtor's  liability  fluctuates  because  sums  are  credited  and"
"debited to an account from time to time (subject usually to a given limit),"
"such  as  an  overdraft  facility  on  a  current  account,  or  sums  advanced"
"under a factoring or invoice discounting facility, provision must be made"
"in the security to ensure that the mortgagor’s liability  does not come to"
"an end when the balance of the account is repaid, or else sums which the"
"mortgagor later draws down may not be covered. A continuing security"
"clause  achieves  this  by  providing  that  the  mortgage  shall  remain  a"
"continuing security for the mortgagor’s obligations to the creditor at any"
"time  and  that  it  shall  not  be  satisfied  or  otherwise  affected  by  any"
"repayment from time to time of the whole or part of the sums due and"
"owing,"
