"Clearly, such a mortgage is not going to secure amounts advanced on"
"an  entirely  different  account  or  under  a  different  loan  agreement."
"Equally  clearly,  there  are  going  to  be  difficulties  if  the  identified"
"account is closed or the original loan agreement is amended."
"The  security  which  a 
lender  takes 
from  a  corporate"
"customer will usually address the issue by defining the secured"
"sums  very  widely  so  as  to  include  all  monies  due  from  the"
"customer to the lender on any account, whatsoever, whether as"
"principal  or  as  surety  and  will  include  all  costs,  charges  and"
"commission. This is commonly known as an 'all-monies charge""."
"31. Both  the  clauses  I  have  culled  out  from  the  mortgage  bonds  can  be"
"properly  called 
‘all-monies  charge’  or 
‘all  debts'  clauses  which  are"
"common in contracts of both guarantee and mortgage."
"32. These clauses, which are also known as 'all accounts', 'all obligations', 'all"
"monies',  'all  moneys',  and  (particularly  in  the  United  States)  dragnet'"
"clauses, are intended to ensure that the party providing the mortgage or"
"guarantee  will  be 
liable  for  all  sums  owed  by  the  debtor  or  other"
"nominated  party  to  the  creditor.  To  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  all"
"eventualities, 
clauses 
of 
this 
nature 
are 
generally 
drawn"
"comprehensively."
