The Accused-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was charged in the Magistrates Court of Wattala for an offence punishable in terms of section 262 of the Penal Code. After trial, by his judgment dated 04.05.2012, the learned Magistrate convicted the appellant for the charge and fixed the date for 18.05.2012 for identification and sentence. Before the date that was fixed for sentencing which was 18.05.2012, the appellant appealed against the judgment of the learned Magistrate to the High Court of Negombo. 2. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the learned High Court Judge by his order dated 27.03.2014, ordered a retrial before the learned Magistrate. Being aggrieved by the above order of the learned High Court Judge, the appellant submitted a petition of appeal to the High Court Registry on 09.04.2014. In the said petition of appeal, the appellant has prayed for an acquittal instead of the retrial ordered by the High Court.",
