"As  already  observed  in  this  judgment  Clause  7.3.2.4  of  the  SOR  clearly  identifies  the  physical"
"requirement of the applicant for the post of Station Master Grade III where the applicant should"
"possess physical ability to discharge the functions of the said post."
"When comparing the above classification with the duties and functions identified in the SOR and"
"the Safety Rules of the Sri Lanka Railways, this Court observes that the above classification is made"
"to achieve the object of recruiting the best candidates for the post of Station Master Grade III which"
"is the recruitment level to the post of Station Master. It is also observed that the physical inability"
"to  perform  all  the  duties  assigned  to  a  Station  Master  Grade  III  would  pose  a  direct  threat  to"
"workplace safety as well."
"A  worker's  health  condition  should  be  taken  into  account by  employers  concerning the  specific"
"requirement of a particular job and should not be considered an obstacle to the right of access to"
"employment or a breach of the rights of disabled persons."
"Article 2 of the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention 1958 to which Sri Lanka"
"is a party stipulates;"
"“Any  distinction,  exclusion  or  preference  in  respect  of  a  particular  job  based  on  the"
"inherent requirements thereof shall not be deemed to be discrimination.”"
"However as revealed before us, before the application for the Post of Station Master Grade III was"
"turned down, the Petitioner was restored to the post of Sub Station Master considering the fact"
"that the Petitioner was fit to perform his duties in the post of Sub Station Master even after him"
"being found guilty of the charges against him on a humanitarian basis."
"During  the  arguments  before  this  Court,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that"
"there are administrative positions in the Station Master Service, and therefore it is not a barrier to"
"post the Petitioner in such a position, without allocating him the duties that cannot be performed"
"by him due to his physical condition."
"By  way  of  an  additional  submission,  the  Petitioner  submitted  an  affidavit  submitting  that,"
"concerning certain functions, instead of the Rule the exceptions would apply and therefore the"
"disability  complained  of  is  not  a  barrier  to  perform  the  duties  of  the  post  of  Station  Master"
