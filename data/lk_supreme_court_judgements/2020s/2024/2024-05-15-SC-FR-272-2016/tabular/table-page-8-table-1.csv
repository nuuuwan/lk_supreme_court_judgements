"H
owever, considering the fact that the Petitioner was functioning as a Sub Station Master even"
"after  his  leg  was  amputated,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  argued  that  there  were  no"
"complaints  of  the  Petitioner’s  failure  to  discharge  the  duties  entrusted  to  him  as  a  Sub  Station"
"Master and therefore the decision not to promote him as a Station Master III was arbitrary. It was"
"further argued on behalf of the Petitioner that facing a special physical test which is not a part of"
"the interview process is also a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1)"
"of  the  Constitution.  The  learned  Counsel  heavily  relied  on  the  Medical  Board  report  submitted"
"along  with the  limited objections  filed  by  the  1st  Respondent  as 1R12  where  the  medical  board"
"having examined the Petitioner had recommended that he was, “fit for normal duties”"
"As  already  observed  in  this  judgment  the  appointment  challenged  before  this  Court  is  not  a"
"‘promotion’ to  the  Petitioner  as  argued  by  the  learned  Counsel but  it  is  an  appointment to  the"
"initial  recruitment  point  in  the  cadre  of  Station  Master.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  fulfill  the"
"requirements based on the duties and functions of the new post the Petitioner has applied for."
"There was no challenge that the Petitioner was employed as the Sub Station Master Hettimulla at"
"the  time  he  obtained  135  marks  at  the  limited  examination,  which  was  sufficient  to  face  the"
"interview."
"As  per  the  service  agreement  signed  between  the  petitioner  and  the  1st  Respondent,  the  main"
"function of the post of Sub Station Master was to handle goods transported through trains and to"
"maintain the substation. For the above purpose, the Sub Station Masters are permitted to recruit"
"porters, gatekeepers, etc."
"However,  when  the  functions  assigned  to  the  Sub  Station  Master  are  compared  to  the  duties"
"assigned to the Station Master Grade III, a significant difference in the duties entrusted to the new"
"post is observed by this Court."
"After  the  arguments  were  concluded,  the  Court  observed  a  major  lapse  on  the  part  of  the"
"Respondents  concerning  the  medical  reports  tendered  to  the  Court.  When  the  Petitioner  was"
"required to face a Medical Board in the year 2016 to ascertain whether he was fit to attend to his"
"work in the new post, the job description submitted before the Medical Board was limited to the"
"duties assigned to the post of Sub Station Master and not to the post of Station Master Grade III"
"(1R12)"
"In the said medical report his duties are recorded as “providing safe custody to the money and"
"state property entrusted to him and to make sure the safety of the goods transported by Railways”"
"and the Medical Board having considered the above duties of the Petitioner had recommended"
"that he is fit for normal duties."
"When considering the nature of the complaint before this Court and the position taken up by the"
"Respondents, it is necessary to ascertain whether the Petitioner is capable of discharging the duties"
"that will entrust to him as a Station Master Grade III since the SOR to the post of Station Master"
"has specifically identified the physical ability as a requirement in the selection criteria."
