P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned President's Counsel for the Substituted

Defendant-Respondent-Appellants and also the submissions of the learned President's

Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent and concluded the argument of this

case.

The Plaintiff in this case, filing Plaint, sought to eject the Defendant from the premises

more fully described in Schedule 01 of the Plaint on the basis that the Defendant had

come to occupy the premises in suit to operate a Bakery upon payment of monthly

rent to the Plaintiff's father. The Defendant through the Admission No. 3, has

specifically admitted that the father of the Plaintiff is the owner of the premises in suit.

The trial proceeded on the above admission as well as on several other admissions

and several issues. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge by his

[SC/ APPEAL/124/2014] - Page 4 of 12

4

Judgment dated 26-06-2003, had concluded that the Plaintiff had not proved her

entitlement to the land described in the Plaint. The learned District Judge also had

come to the conclusion that there was no lease in existence between the Plaintiff and

the Defendant. It was on that basis that the learned District Judge had decided to

dismiss the action of the Plaintiff.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment of the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff had

appealed to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. The Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals after considering the material adduced in the trial, had come to the

conclusion that the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff has established to the

satisfaction of Court, that she is entitled to succeed with the prayers in her Plaint.

Thus, the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals by its Judgement dated 29-05-2012,

had proceeded to set aside the Judgment of the District Court and concluded that the

Plaintiff is entitled to the relief as per prayers a, b, c, & e of the prayers to the

Plaint.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals, the Defendant filed the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant to this Appeal. By

its order dated 21-07-2014, this Court has granted Leave to Appeal in respect of four

questions set out in paragraph 12 of the Amended Petition dated 08-06-2013. These

questions of law are as follows:

(a) Have their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court seriously misdirected

themselves when they held that the action filed by the Plaintiff is a rei-vindicatio

action when it is very clear that the cause of action described in the Plaint with

regard to the arrears of payment of lease rental by the Defendant which is clear

from the issues No. 4 to 7 raised by her at the trail?

(b) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court also fail to consider that

when the Plaintiff demanded the payment of lease rental the question of title

does not arise and in any event in the instant case there are clear and cogent

evidence that the Defendant did not deny the Plaintiff's title and it was his

[SC/ APPEAL/124/2014] - Page 5 of 12

5

contention that the Plaintiffs father permitted him to continue the business of

running the Bakery?

(c) Did their Lordships fail to consider that the Plaintiff did not institute this action

on the basis of a co-owner nor did she raise an issue to that effect and further

in her own pleadings that the Defendant was a Lessee. Therefore, she is not

entitled to eject the Defendant as a co-owner as said right is given to a co-

owner only if the Defendant is a trespasser?

(d) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court unreasonably reject the

clear finding of the Additional District Judge that the Plaintiff has failed to prove

on balance of probability her contractual relationship to the Defendant as a

Lessor of the said premises and also to prove the documents submitted by her

in proof of payment of rental when the Defendant vehemently denied the said

documents?

Having regard to the submissions made before us and the facts and circumstances of

this case, we think it would suffice for us to consider and answer the question of law

set out in paragraph 12(d) of the Amended Petition.

As has been set out before, the Defendant has admitted the title of the father of the

Plaintiff. The father of the Plaintiff is Abraham Jayasundera. Admittedly, the Defendant

does not claim title on any written document or deed. It is also admitted that the

Defendant had come to occupy this premises with the licence of the father of the

Plaintiff. This was the position taken up by the Defendant in his oral evidence before

the trial Court as well. The said oral evidence of the Defendant could be reproduced

in the following way:

In the course of his evidence, at another place, the Defendant has even proceeded to

admit that the license to carry on the business of the bakery which he was involved

in, has been issued to the Plaintiffs father. This was followed by the subsequent

renewal of the said license in the name of the mother of the Plaintiff after the death

of the Plaintiffs father. The documentary evidence regarding this fact has also been

produced by the Plaintiff through the receipts marked P 1 P 63.

The Defendant in his evidence before the trial Court, has also admitted that it was the

Plaintiff who had paid the water bills, electricity bills and also rates to the Local

Authority. At page 77 of the brief, the following excerpts from the evidence of the

Defendant, shows that the Defendant has not been able to take up a specific position

with regard to his status of possession of this property. These questions and answers

are reproduced below:

Having regard to the above evidence, we are satisfied that the Defendant has entered

into this property with the leave and license of the father of the Plaintiff.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants also made submissions stating that

the Plaintiff has not proved the fact that the Plaintiff is the full owner of the property.

Although, the learned District Judge had proceeded on the basis that the Plaintiff had

not been successful in proving her title to the whole property, we observe that the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals had correctly chosen to go on the basis that it is

possible even for a co-owner of a land to eject a person who is in unauthorized

possession. In this regard we would like to cite here just two judgments which are as

follows. In the case of Harriette v Pathmasiri,3 this Court has held as follows:

"Our law recognizes the right of a co-owner to sue a trespasser to have

his title to an undivided share declared and for ejectment of the

trespasser from the whole land because the owner of an undivided share

has an interest in every part and portion of the entire land."

Citing the above case with approval, Sisira De Abrew J in the case of Nuwarapakshage

Balasuriya v Nuwarapakshage Neelakanthi alias Baby,4 stated the following:

It is a commonsense principle that a co-owner has an interest in every

part of the entire land. Thus, when a trespasser enjoys the fruits of the

property the co-owner's rights are affected and he becomes entitled to

eject the trespasser.

We observe that even the learned District Judge has not refused the fact that Abraham

Jayasundera is the father of the Plaintiff and therefore at its least, the Plaintiff is

necessarily a co-owner as at least some share will devolve of fathers property on the

Plaintiff after the fathers death in the absence of any other conveyance by the father.

Although the Plaintiff had adduced evidence in the trial to prove that she is the owner

of the whole property, in view of the afore-mentioned legal position that even a co-

owner is entitled to eject a trespasser from the whole land, we do not think it

necessary to go in to the question whether or not the Plaintiff is the owner of the

whole property. Moreover, as has already been mentioned above, the Defendant does

not claim any title to this property. Admittedly, the Defendant has never ever paid any

rent either to the father of the Plaintiff or to the Plaintiff or to any other person. This

is manifest by the evidence of the Defendant. The following excerpts taken from his

evidence would establish that position.

As has been stated above, the father of the Plaintiff is Abraham Jayasundera.

Admittedly, the Defendant does not claim title on any written document or deed. It is

also admitted that the Defendant had come to occupy this premises with the licence

of the father of the Plaintiff.

Although the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals has considered whether the

Defendant has succeeded in establishing a prescriptive title to this property, we

observe that the Defendant has neither claimed such prescriptive title to this property

in his answer nor raised any issue in that regard. We also observe that the learned

District Judge has also not discussed the aspect of prescriptive title in his Judgment.

Thus, it appears that the question whether the Defendant has succeeded in

establishing a prescriptive title to this property, has only popped up in the appeal

before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals, at the instance of the Defendant.

This is something unacceptable. Explanation 2 to Section 150 of the Civil Procedure

Code is a clear bar for a party to advance a case that is materially different from that

advanced in the original Court. It reads as follows:

Explanation 2, Section 150 Civil Procedure Code

The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the partys pleading,

i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. And no party can be allowed

to make at the trial a case materially different from that which he has

placed on record, and which his opponent is prepared to meet. And the

facts proposed to be established must in the whole amount to so much

of the material part of his case as is not admitted in his opponents

pleadings.

This provision has been interpreted by Chief Justice G. P. S. de Silva in the case of

Candappa nee Bastian v Ponnambalampillai.9 The relevant excerpt from the above

Judgement is reproduced below.

Thus it is seen that the position taken up in appeal for the first time

was not in accord with the case as presented by the defendant in the

District Court. It is well to bear in mind the provisions of explanation 2

to section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code. It reads thus: "The case

enunciated must reasonably accord with the party's pleading, i.e. plaint

or answer, as the case may be. And no party can be allowed to make at

the trial a case materially different from that which he has placed on

9 [1993] 1 SLR 184 at 189.

[SC/ APPEAL/124/2014] - Page 11 of 12

11

record, and which his opponent is prepared to meet ......" A fortiori, a

party cannot be permitted to present in appeal a case different from the

case presented before the trial Court except in accordance with the

principles laid down by the House of Lords in The Tasmania [(1890) 15

App. Cases 233] and followed by Dias, J. in Setha v. Weerakoon [49

NLR 225 at 228, 229].

In the instant case, despite the afore-stated legal bar for the Defence to agitate a

claim on prescription, consideration of the available evidence, particularly the evidence

adduced by the Defendant, satisfies us that the Defendant has not succeeded in

establishing a prescriptive title to this property.

After going through the Judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals, we

observe that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals have

considered the above factors and given adequate reasons as to why they had decided

to set aside the Judgment of the District Court and grant relief as per prayers a, b,

c and e of the prayers of the Plaint. Therefore, we answer the question of law set

out in paragraph 12(d) in the negative.

Accordingly, we decide to dismiss this Appeal without costs.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
