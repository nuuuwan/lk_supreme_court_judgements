"[SC/ APPEAL/124/2014] - Page 8 of 12"
"We observe that even the learned District Judge has not refused the fact that Abraham"
"Jayasundera  is  the  father  of  the  Plaintiff  and  therefore  at  its  least,  the  Plaintiff  is"
"necessarily a co-owner as at least some share will devolve of father’s property on the"
"Plaintiff after the father’s death in the absence of any other conveyance by the father."
"Although the Plaintiff had adduced evidence in the trial to prove that she is the owner"
"of the whole property, in view of the afore-mentioned legal position that even a co-"
"owner  is  entitled  to  eject  a  trespasser  from  the  whole  land,  we  do  not  think  it"
"necessary  to  go  in  to  the  question  whether or  not  the  Plaintiff  is  the  owner  of  the"
"whole property. Moreover, as has already been mentioned above, the Defendant does"
"not claim any title to this property. Admittedly, the Defendant has never ever paid any"
"rent either to the father of the Plaintiff or to the Plaintiff or to any other person. This"
"is manifest by the evidence of the Defendant. The following excerpts taken from his"
"evidence would establish that position."
