This is an Appeal to set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of Western Province

holden in Colombo (hereinafter referred to as the High Court), dated 12th July 2011 where it was

held that the learned District Judge has erred in holding that the defendantsrespondents

appellants (hereinafter referred to as the appellants) were entitled to the land in suit.

The plaintiffappellantrespondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) instituted an

action in the District Court of Matugama against the 1st defendant-respondent-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st appellant) praying, inter alia for a declaration of title to the land

4

described in the first schedule to the Plaint, and he is the owner of the articles listed in the second

schedule to the Plaint.

Further, the respondent prayed for the ejectment of the appellants from the said land and claimed

a sum of Rs. 2,500/- per month from 1st of June, 1994 as damages until the respondent is placed in

possession of the said land.

The respondent further averred that he became the owner of the said land and premises on the 15th

of January, 1988 and placed the appellants in possession thereof as licensees on or about the 1st of

June, 1988. Further, he permitted the appellants to use and enjoy the movables listed in the second

schedule.

On the 18th of April, 1994 the respondent had sent a notice to the 1st appellant terminating the said

license granted to him to occupy the said premises, and requested him to hand over possession of

the land, premises and movables on or before the 31st of May, 1994. The 1st appellant, through his

Attorney-at-Law had sent the letter dated 9th of May, refusing to vacate the premises and refused

to accept the title of the respondent. Further, in the said letter, the 1st appellant had taken up the

position that the said land and premises were purchased by the appellants in the name of the

respondent as a trust.

Later, the 2nd defendant-respondent-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd appellant), who

is the wife of the 1st appellant, was added as a party to the District Court action as the 2nd defendant,

consequent to an application made by her to court.

In their joint amended Answer dated 26th of August, 1997, the appellants took up the positions,

inter alia, that the consideration on the said Deed No. 3749 was provided for by both the appellants

as the respondent promised to transfer the said property to the appellants whenever they made a

request for the transfer of the property.

Evidence led at the Trial

The vendor of the said deed, Yasawathie Perera, gave evidence at the trial on behalf of the

respondent, and stated that with regard to the said sale of the property, she only dealt with the

respondent and that the consideration of Rs. 125,000/- had been paid by the respondent to the

5

Notary. Later, the Notary handed over the said money to her. She further stated that the appellants

were not known to her and that they never took part in the said transaction. Further, the broker

who found the said property for the respondent gave evidence at the trial and stated that at the time

the said deed was executed by the Notary, the appellants were not present.

The Grama Niladhari for the area in which the appellants resided, Don Lionel, and a clerk from

the Divisional Secretariat gave evidence at the trial and stated that the appellants and their child

were in receipt of food stamps under the Janasaviya Programme in 1989 and 1992. He further

stated that only persons who were in receipt of an income less that Rs. 300/- per month were

entitled to such food stamps. Further, the Grama Niladhari for the area in which the property in

suit was situated, A. K. Piyadasa, gave evidence and stated that the 1st and 2nd appellants are given

as occupants of the house in suit in the Village List and also that they came into occupation on the

31st of March, 1988. It was further stated that the name of the owner of the house is given as that

of the respondent.

The respondent, in giving evidence stated that he knew the 1st appellant as he was supplying latex

rubber to his rubber store. Further, the 1st appellant requested the said premises for a short period

of time as he was asked to vacate the house that he was occupying by the landlord. He further

stated that it was he who paid the full consideration for the house in suit and that it was bought by

him for his own use. The respondent also stated that he made certain improvements to the house

and denied the allegation that he held the property in trust for the respondents.

The 2nd appellant also gave evidence and stated that a few days after the said deed was written, she

wanted the respondent to re-transfer the property in her name as she wanted the deed for the

purpose of admitting her son to school. Moreover, she obtained the letter P12 from the

respondent, where he admitted that the money for the purchase of the land was given by her, and

that the respondent was holding the land in her favour. The respondent, however, stated that the

letter, P12 was given to the 2nd appellant upon her request to facilitate the admission of her child

to the school and thus, it was not an admission that the said money was paid by the 2nd appellant

to purchase the property.

She further stated that she gave the money to the respondent on the 25th of December, 1987 prior

to the execution of the deed as the respondent was the one who found the house. She further stated

6

that she got to know the respondent in 1987 and that she had an illicit affair with him from March,

1987.

The 2nd appellant went on to state that as at January 1988 she had Rs. 30,000/- to 40,000/- in her

Savings book. Further, she stated that she sold her business to a cousin brother, Leslie, for Rs.

71,000/- to raise funds to purchase the house.

The 2nd appellant in her evidence stated that she visited the house/land and went to the Notaries

office prior to the purchasing the house. In giving evidence at the trial, it was stated as follows,

Judgment of the District Court

Upon the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Matugama delivered Judgment dated

28th of March, 2003, answering all the issues in favour of the appellants and granted all the reliefs

prayed for in the amended Answer. Further, it was held, inter alia, that the letter dated 15th of July,

7

1988 which is admittedly written by the respondent, contains an admission that the subject property

had been purchased by the 2nd appellant in the name of the respondent. Further, it was held that

the respondent had failed to prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court

Being aggrieved by the said Judgement of the District Court, the respondent appealed to the High

Court of Civil Appeals of the Western Province holden in Kalutara. After hearing the submissions

of the parties, the Civil Appellate High Court allowed the Appeal of the respondent and set aside

the judgment of the District Court. In the said judgment, it was held that the District Court

judgment was based on unfounded and uncorroborated evidence. Moreover, it was held that the

appellants were not entitled to the subject property described in the first schedule to the Plaint.

Appeal to the Supreme Court

When the application was supported for granting of leave, this Court granted leave to appeal on

the following question of law:

Did the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges err in holding that the

Petitioner has failed to discharge the burden placed on him by law as

regards prayer of adequate circumstances with respect to the alleged

constructive trust?

Did the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges err in holding that the Petitioner has

failed to discharge the burden placed on him by law as regards prayer of adequate

circumstances with respect to the illegal constructive trust?

The learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, inter-alia, stated in the said judgment;

The burden of proof shifted to the Defendant after the Plaintiff had

proved by calling the Notary Public who had attested the said deed, that it

8

was an outright transfer but not a constructive trust created by the Plaintiff

for the 2nd Defendant

However as aforementioned, the said Notary, who was a vital witness to this case did not testify

at the trial. Further, his evidence is vital as the parties are at variance with regard to the person who

paid consideration to purchase the property.

Moreover, the learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court held,

As is said earlier, nothing was proved by the Defendant that the said P1

was a forgery and not an act and deed of the said Ratnasekara

A careful consideration of the evidence reveals that a person named Ratnasekara had not given

evidence at the trial before the District Court.

The powers of the appellate courts in hearing civil appeals and the requirements of the judges are

set out in section 774 of the Civil Procedure Code, which states as follows;

(1) On the termination of the hearing of the appeal, the Court of Appeal

shall either at once or on some future day, which shall either then be

appointed for the purpose, or of which notice shall subsequently be given to

the parties or their Counsel, pronounce judgment in open court; and if the

bench hearing the appeal is composed of more than one Judge, each Judge

may, if he desires it, pronounce a separate judgment.

(2) The judgment which shall be given or taken down in writing, shall be

signed dated by the Judge or Judges, as the case may be, and shall state-

(a) the points for determination;

(b) the decision of the Judge or Judges thereon;

(c) the reasons which have led to the decision;

(d) the relief, if any, to which the appellant is entitled on the appeal in

consequence of the decision.

However, as stated above, the reasons which led to the decision to set aside the judgment of the

District Court are based on facts that were not transpired at the trial before the District Court.

9

Hence, the impugned judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court is contrary to section 774(2)(c)

of the Civil Procedure Code as amended.

Further, an appellate court should not interfere with the findings of facts of a learned judge who

has had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of witnesses at the trial. A similar view was

expressed in the case of De Silva and others vs. Seneviratne and another (1981) 2 SLR page 7,

where it was held;

(1) Where an Appellate Court is invited to review the findings of a trial

judge on questions of fact, the principles that should guide it are as

follows:

a. Where the findings on questions of fact are based upon the

credibility of witnesses on the footing of a trial judges

perception of such evidence, then such findings are entitled to

great weight and the utmost consideration and will be reversed

only if it appears to the Appellate Court that the trial judge has

failed to make full use of his advantage of seeing and listening

to the witnesses and the Appellate Court is convinced by the

plainest considerations that it would be justified in doing so;

b. That however where the findings of fact are based upon the trial

judges evaluation of facts, the Appellate Court is then in as

good a position as the trial judge to evaluate such facts and no

sanctity attaches to such findings of fact of a trial judge;

c. Where it appears to an Appellate Court that on either of these

grounds the findings of fact by a trial judge should be reversed

then the Appellate Court ought not to shrink from that task

In view of the aforementioned erroneous findings in the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High

Court on vital facts, I answer the following question as follows;

10

Did the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges err in holding that the Petitioner has failed

to discharge the burden placed on him by law as regards prayer of adequate circumstances with

respect to the alleged constructive trust?

Yes

In the circumstances, the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 12th July, 2011 is set

aside. In view of the above, the other questions of law were not considered in this judgment. Hence,

the instant appeal is sent back to the Civil Appellate High Court to re-hear the appeal on merits.

At the rehearing, the parties are entitled to make fresh submission before the said court.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

No costs.
