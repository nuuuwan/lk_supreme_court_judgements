"was an outright transfer but not a constructive trust created by the Plaintiff"
"for the 2nd Defendant…”"
"However as aforementioned, the said Notary, who was a vital witness to this case did not testify"
"at the trial. Further, his evidence is vital as the parties are at variance with regard to the person who"
"paid consideration to purchase the property."
"Moreover, the learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court held,"
"“… As is said earlier, nothing was proved by the Defendant that the said P1"
"was a forgery and not an act and deed of the said Ratnasekara…”"
"A careful consideration of the evidence reveals that a person named ‘Ratnasekara’ had not given"
"evidence at the trial before the District Court."
"The powers of the appellate courts in hearing civil appeals and the requirements of the judges are"
"set out in section 774 of the Civil Procedure Code, which states as follows;"
"“(1) On the termination of the hearing of the appeal, the Court of Appeal"
"shall  either  at  once  or  on  some  future  day,  which  shall  either  then  be"
"appointed for the purpose, or of which notice shall subsequently be given to"
"the parties or their Counsel, pronounce judgment in open court; and if the"
"bench hearing the appeal is composed of more than one Judge, each Judge"
"may, if he desires it, pronounce a separate judgment."
"(2) The judgment which shall be given or taken down in writing, shall be"
"signed dated by the Judge or Judges, as the case may be, and shall state-"
"(a) the points for determination;"
"(b) the decision of the Judge or Judges thereon;"
"(c) the reasons which have led to the decision;"
"(d)  the  relief,  if  any,  to  which  the  appellant  is  entitled  on  the  appeal  in"
"consequence of the decision.”"
"However, as stated above, the reasons which led to the decision to set aside the judgment of the"
"District  Court  are  based  on  facts  that  were  not  transpired  at  the  trial  before  the  District  Court."
