"02) were alienated and he permitted his brother the Defendant, to occupy a portion of the"
"remaining lot 03."
"The Plaintiff also pleaded that subdivision of the land took place according to Plan"
"bearing No 269/1995, and  the 2nd schedule  to the  plaint depicted the extent of  lot 03 as"
"AO RO P9.3 and the 3rd schedule of the plaint as the area occupied by the Defendant which"
"was in extent of AO RO P5."
"The plaint is silent on which date the Defendant became the Plaintiff’s licensee but"
"states that though requested the Defendant failed to vacate the portion of the land occupied"
"by him. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Plaintiff sued the Defendant and also claimed"
"damages."
"The Defendant on the other hand, sought to dismiss the Plaintiff’s case and further"
"moved for a declaration that the Plaintiff is holding the paper title to lot 03, on a constructive"
"trust, in favour of the Defendant."
"The Defendant also pleaded that the entire land in extent of  24.10 perches depicted"
"in Plan No 269/1995 was purchased from the consideration provided by the mother and her"
"intention  was  to  purchase  the  land  for  the  benefit  of  both  sons,  the  Plaintiff  and  the"
"Defendant."
"At the trial, the right to begin the case fell upon the Defendant, since the paper title"
"was admitted and a constructive trust was pleaded by the Defendant."
"In his evidence, the Defendant took up the position that he together with the mother"
"and the brother (who were all daily paid workers) lived in the land. Upon the marriage of"
"the  Defendant,  the  brother  (the  Plaintiff)  moved  out  of  the  land.  Lots  01  and  02  were"
"subsequently alienated. The Defendant and the mother continued to occupy lot 03 and lived"
"in a wattle and daub hut. Later, a permanent structure was put up with the savings of the"
"Defendant’s wife who was employed in the Middle East."
"The Plaintiff subsequently returned to the land and constructed a house on a part of"
"lot 03. The Defendant also constructed a boundary wall around his house."
"Thereafter, the Plaintiff began to dispute the Defendant’s right to lot 03. It came to"
"light that the Plaintiff (being the elder brother) had executed the Deed bearing No. 2825 in"
"favour of the Plaintiff, against the wishes of the mother, who intended to transfer the land"
"in favour of both her sons. The Defendant pleaded that the consideration for the land was"
"paid by the mother from her savings in a “cheetu” scheme."
"The learned District Judge, having analysed the evidence before court accepted the"
"version of the Defendant viz-a-viz the Plaintiff i.e., the consideration for the land way back"
"in 1984 was paid by the mother, the land was intended to be purchased for the benefit of"
"the Plaintiff and the Defendant, and the Plaintiff holds the paper title of the land in dispute,"
"depicted in the 3rd schedule, in extent of 5 perches in favour of the Defendant."
"Having held so, the learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiff’s case and upheld"
"the claim-in-reconvention of the Defendant based upon ‘Constructive Trust’ and granted"
"the relief prayed for by the Defendant."
