"inferred. The said section indicates a person bound in a fiduciary character to protect the"
"interests of another gains for himself any pecuniary  advantage adverse to the other, then"
"such person must hold the benefit, for the other person."
"From the evidence elicited in the instant case or to use the language in the statute"
"the  ‘attendant  circumstances’,  it  is  apparent  that  the  mother  paid  the  consideration  and"
"purchased the land for the benefit of the two sons and entrusted the elder son (the Plaintiff)"
"to execute the deed in the name of both sons (the Plaintiff and the Defendant). Nevertheless,"
"the Plaintiff only included his name as the vendee and thereby gained an advantage to the"
"detriment of the Defendant. The intention of the mother was not to give a gift only to one"
"son (the Plaintiff) and hence, it was contended that the Plaintiff must hold the benefit of the"
"advantage in favour of the Defendant, whose interests have been prejudiced."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  also  submitted  that  Section  91  is  an"
"extension to Section 90 and contended that though not specifically referred to in Section"
"90, a family member who is in charge of family property also falls within the realms of"
"such section. Therefore, the case of the Defendant was that a constructive trust was created"
"and  the  Plaintiff,  was  holding,  the  land  in  a  fiduciary  character  for  the  benefit  of  the"
"Defendant."
"The Counsel for the Respondent also drew the attention of Court to Section 96 of"
"the Trusts Ordinance."
"The said Section which can be construed as an omnibus clause, covers a situation"
"where  a  particular  set  of  facts  may  not  on  all  fours,  come  within  the  parameters  of  the"
"constructive trust to be  inferred  in terms of Sections 83  to 95. Even in such a situation,"
"where a trust  is not created,  this  section recognizes  the person having possession of the"
"property but who is legitimately not entitled to the beneficial interest of the whole property,"
"as  holding  the  property  for  the  benefit  of  the  person  having  such  interest,  to  the  extent"
"necessary to satisfy such person’s just demands."
"Hence, the contention of the  learned Counsel for the Respondent was that in the"
"given instance, a constructive trust was created under Section 96 as well since, the Plaintiff"
"who has the paper title to the property, but who is not entitled to have the whole beneficial"
"interest of the property [because the intention of the mother was to gift the property to both"
"the Plaintiff and the Defendant] holds the said property in trust, for the beneficial interest"
"of the Defendant."
"Having  considered  the  submissions  made  for  the  Appellant  and  the  Respondent"
"pertaining to the creation of a constructive trust, my considered view in the instant matter"
"is that, a ‘Constructive Trust’ had been created in terms of Sections 90, 91 and 96 of the"
"Trusts Ordinance."
