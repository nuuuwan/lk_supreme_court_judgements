"","The important pieces of evidence to which the attention of this Court was drawn to,"
"were the failure of the Plaintiff to establish his income when the deed was executed and",""
"consideration paid, the manner and mode of such payment by the Plaintiff (alleged to have",""
"been on instalments spanning a period of 10 years), the Plaintiff’s failure to establish the",""

"","A ‘Constructive Trust’, is not an actual or an express trust formed in the traditional"

"trust is formed where it would be unconscionable for a person who holds a property or an",""
"asset, to deny the beneficial interest in the property or the asset, to the other person.",""
"","Earlier in this judgement, reference was drawn to the works of legal luminaries and"
"their views and observations pertaining to constructive trusts, classification of such trusts",""
"and  the  circumstances  under  which  such  trusts  arise.  Reference  was  also  made  to  the",""
"English Law and the evolution of the constructive trusts and its codification.",""
"The  English  Law","rules  and  precedents  on  Constructive  Trusts  have  been"
