"Trusts by operation of law are such as are not declared by a"
"party at all, either directly or indirectly, but result from the"
"effect of a rule of equity, and are either: (i) resulting trusts,"
"[…]  or  (2)  constructive  trusts,  which  the  Court  elicits  by  a"
"construction put upon certain acts of the parties […]”"
"Thus, at page 37, Keeton observes-"
"“It will be apparent from Lewin’s observations that an"
"implied trust is one which the Court deduces from the conduct"
"of the parties, and the circumstances of the transaction. It is"
"important  to notice  that here the function of the Court is  to"
"discover what the presumed intention of the parties was, and"
"to give effect to it”."
