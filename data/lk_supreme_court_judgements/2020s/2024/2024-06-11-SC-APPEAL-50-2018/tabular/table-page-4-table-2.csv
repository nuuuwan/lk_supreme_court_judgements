"Keeton on the Law of Trusts 9th Edition at page 36 refers to a very old case Cook"
"v. Fountain (1676) 3 Swanst 585, 592, where Lord Nottingham attempted a classification"
"of trusts in the following terms:-"
"“All trusts are either, first,  express  trusts,  which are"
"raised  and  created  by  act  of  the  parties,  or  implied  trusts,"
"which  are  raised  or  created  by  act  or  construction  of  law;"
"again, express trusts are declared either by word or writing;"
"and these declarations appear either by direct  and manifest"
"proof, or violent and necessary presumption. These last are"
"commonly  called  presumptive  trusts;  and  that  is,  when  the"
"Court,  upon  consideration  of  all  circumstances,  presumes"
"there was a declaration, either by word or writing, though the"
"plain  and  direct  proof  thereof  be  not  extant.  In  the  case  in"
"question  there  is  no  pretence  of  any  proof  that  there  was  a"
"trust  declared  either  by  word  or  in  writing;  so  the  trust,  if"
"there be any, must either be implied by the law, or presumed"
"by the Court.”"
