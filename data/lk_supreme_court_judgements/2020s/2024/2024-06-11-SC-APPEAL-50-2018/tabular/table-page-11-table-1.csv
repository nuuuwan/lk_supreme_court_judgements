"Defendant.  Although  fraud  has  not  been  averred  to  by  the  Defendant,  in  my  view,  the"
"actions of the Plaintiff borders on same."
"Nevertheless,  the  questions  of  law  raised  before  this  Court,  are  in  respect  of"
"‘Constructive Trusts’. Having considered the evidence led, I hold that the trial court has"
"correctly deduced the attendant circumstances, the conduct of the parties, the circumstances"
"of the transaction, the presumed intention of the parties and given effect to such intention,"
"considering it as a constructive trust situation."
"In the aforesaid circumstances, I answer the three questions of law in the affirmative"
"and in favour of the Respondent."
"I  uphold  the  judgement  of  the  District  Court  dated  04th  October,  2012  and  the"
"judgement of the High Court dated 22nd March, 2017."
"The decision of the District Court and the High Court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s case"
"with costs and to grant the claim-in-reconvention of the Defendant is also upheld."
"For  reasons  morefully  adumbrated  in  this  judgement,  the  appeal  of  the  Plaintiff-"
"Appellant-Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 150,000/="
"The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant is directed to make the payment of costs, in a sum"
"of Rs 150,000/=, to the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent forthwith."
