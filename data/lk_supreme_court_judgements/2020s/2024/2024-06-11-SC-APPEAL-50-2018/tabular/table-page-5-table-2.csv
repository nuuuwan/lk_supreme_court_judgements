"important  to notice  that here the function of the Court is  to"
"discover what the presumed intention of the parties was, and"
"to give effect to it”."
"This  Court  too  on  numerous  occasions  have  held,  that  the  trial  courts  should  be"
"satisfied  that  extrinsic  evidence  to  prove  ‘attendant  circumstances’  have  been  properly"
"received in evidence at the trial."
"This Court has held that the attendant circumstances would depend on the facts of"
"each case and the burden of proof  lies on  the person who claims a constructive  trust  to"
"prove that it cannot be reasonably inferred from the attendant circumstances that the said"
"party intended to part with or depose of the beneficial interest in the land. Vide Dayawathie"
"and Others v. Gunesekera and Another [1991] 1 SLR 115; Premawathi v. Gnanawathi"
"[1994] 2 SLR 17 and  Somawathie v. Alles S.C. Appeal 114/2011 decided on 05.12.2019."
"In the instant appeal, for the Defendant who claims the constructive trust to succeed"
"he  should  have  placed  relevant  evidence  before  the  trial  court  for  the  trial  court  to"
"reasonably infer from the attendant circumstances, that the beneficial interest was still with"
"him."
"The learned trial judge and the learned judges of the High Court in their judgements"
"have categorically observed, that the Defendant was able to prove all the contentions taken"
"up in his answer, whereas the Plaintiff has failed to establish that he was not holding lot 03"
"in favour of the Defendant."
"The Appellant (the Plaintiff) in his written submissions to this Court, takes up the"
"position  that  the  Defendant  was  unable  to  establish  that  the  Plaintiff  was  holding  the"
"property  in  the  Plaintiff’s  name  on  behalf  of  and/or  in  favour  of  the  Defendant.  The"
"Appellant relied on the following facts to put forward the argument and justify his case that"
"the Defendant failed to establish his contention."
