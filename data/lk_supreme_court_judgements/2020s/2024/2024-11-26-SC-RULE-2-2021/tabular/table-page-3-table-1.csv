"should not be made absolute. Accordingly, the Respondent filed an affidavit on 24th June"
"2022  denying  the  allegations  levelled  against  him  and  setting  out  his  position  on  the"
"matters contained in the said Rule, thus necessitating this Court to proceed to hold an"
"inquiry."
"T
he Rule was read over to the Respondent in Open Court on 6th December 2022. With the"
"Respondent pleading not guilty, the inquiry commenced on 4th April 2023. The learned"
"Deputy  Solicitor  General  led  the  evidence  of  three  witnesses, 
including  that  of  the"
"Complainant  and  the  Examiner  of  Questioned  Documents  who  had  examined  the"
"signature  of  the  Complainant  on  the 
impugned  proxy,  compared 
it  with  specimen"
"signatures of the Complainant and confirmed in his report that the signature on the proxy"
"is not that of the Complainant."
"A
t the request of the learned Counsel for the Respondent, the aforementioned affidavit"
"of the Respondent was considered as his evidence-in-chief. After the conclusion of the"
"cross  examination  of  the  Respondent  and  while  under  re-examination,  the 
learned"
"Counsel 
for 
the  Respondent,  having  obtained 
instructions 
from 
the  Respondent,"
"submitted that the Respondent wishes to withdraw his initial plea of not guilty and plead"
"to all charges contained in the Rule. This Court thereafter inquired from the Respondent"
"on the withdrawal of the initial plea and him pleading guilty to the Rule almost at the tail"
"end of the inquiry, and being satisfied that the Respondent is acting voluntarily and fully"
"understands the consequences of such action, permitted the Respondent to withdraw his"
"initial plea and to plead guilty to the Rule. The Rule was thereafter made absolute against"
"the Respondent."
"W
ith  the  only 
issue 
left  to  be  decided  being  whether  the  Respondent  should  be"
"suspended  from  practice  or  removed  from  office,  this  Court  afforded  all  parties  an"
"opportunity of making submissions with regard to the action that should be taken by this"
"Court. In arriving at a conclusion, I shall bear in mind the case of In Re Fernando [(1959)"
"63 NLR 233; at page 234] where Chief Justice Basnayake stated that:"
"â€œThe power to remove or suspend a proctor from his office is one that is meant to be"
"exercised for the protection of the profession and the public and for the purpose of"
