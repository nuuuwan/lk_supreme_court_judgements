Justice  A.  R.  B.  Amerasinghe

The diligent handling of a particular matter includes inquiring into and analysis of"
"","the  factual  and 
legal  elements  of  the  problem  and  the  use  of  methods  and"
"","procedures  meeting  the  standards  of  competent  practitioners. 
It  also 
includes"
"","adequate  preparation.  An  Attorney  should  undertake  such  preparation  as 
is"
"","reasonably necessary and practicable in the circumstances. The required attention"
"","and preparation are determined in part by what is at stake, and the complexity of"
"","the  matter;  but  thoroughness  and  adequate  preparation  are  necessary  in  every"
"","case.” [Page 291]"
"","“
An attorney’s practice must be efficiently and properly administered and his work"
"","must  be  subject  to  appropriate  systems  and  controlled  by  him.  Office  staff  and"
"","facilities adequate to his practice must be maintained, so that each matter can be"
"","handled adequately and effectively in time, or that early and sufficient notice would"
"","be  given  if  professional  engagements  cannot  be  fulfilled,  and  in  general,  that  a"
"","quality of service at least equal to that which competent lawyers would expect in"
"","a like situation are rendered. Otherwise he may be found wanting with regard to his"
"","duty of diligence.[ Page 293]"
"A","n Attorney-at-Law must therefore act with due diligence at all times in his engagement"
"with a client. The right to be remunerated for the professional services provided by such",""
"Attorney-at-Law  is  therefore  contingent  upon  providing  such  client  with  a  quality  of",""
"service that competent lawyers would render.",""
