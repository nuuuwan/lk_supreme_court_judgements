"B
y  way  of  a  written  complaint  dated  23rd  April  2012,  Ashanthi  Weerakoon 
[the"
"Complainant] informed the Hon. Chief Justice as follows:"
"(
a) 
She  had  signed  as  a  guarantor  to  a  loan  taken  by  Udaya  Nilantha  De  Silva  [the"
"Borrower] to purchase a motor vehicle;"
"(
b) 
Due  to  the  non-payment  of  the  monthly  instalments,  the  lessor  Ceylinco  Leasing"
"Corporation  Limited  had 
instituted  proceedings 
in  the  Commercial  High  Court"
"against the Borrower and the two guarantors, and that she had been named as the"
"3rd defendant [Case No. CHC (Civil) No. 28/2019MR];"
"(
c) 
Although she had not met the Respondent at any time, a proxy said to contain her"
"signature had been filed by the Respondent and answer had been filed on her behalf"
"without her providing any instructions to the Respondent;"
"(
d) 
Judgment  had  been  entered  against  her  by  the  Commercial  High  Court  on  30th"
"March 2012;"
"(e) 
Although she had sought to file a notice of appeal through an Attorney-at-Law of"
"her  choice,  it  had  been  rejected  due  to  a  proxy  having  already  been  filed  by  the"
"Respondent, thus depriving her of  the opportunity of filing an appeal against  the"
"said judgment;"
"(
f) 
She firmly believes that the Respondent had colluded with the Borrower in forging"
"her signature and deprived her the opportunity of presenting her defense in the said"
"case."
