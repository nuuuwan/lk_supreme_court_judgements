"Justice Amerasinghe has pointed out further in Professional Ethics and Responsibilities"
"of Lawyers [supra] that, “In general, a lawyer comes into a matter only of he is ‘instructed’"
"by a client” [page 304] and “An attorney should not act in a professional capacity for a"
"party in any matter, whether contentious or otherwise, except at the request of a party or"
"at the request of a registered attorney.” [page 305] Thus, it is a fundamental requirement"
"that  an  Attorney-at-Law  must  obtain  instructions  from  his  client  in  order  to  represent"
"such client."
