"Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers [supra] where Justice Amerasinghe"
"has emphasised the said responsibility as follows:"
"“There  is a  heavy duty on  a  registered  attorney  to ensure  that  all things that are"
"expected of him by the law and in terms of the standards of the profession are done"
"diligently,  promptly,  conscientiously,  with  reasonable  competence.  The  registered"
"attorney performs the functions previously performed by proctors in employing and"
"instructing counsel, carrying out his advice and organizing the case behind the lines,"
"e.g., in obtaining the evidence which counsel needs, in taking proofs from witnesses,"
"securing their attendance and the like. Where he fails in his duty he may be guilty of"
"being in breach of his contract with his client with regard to the organisation of the"
"case for presentation to the court in terms of his proxy and liable for resulting loss.”"
