"The  Court  of Appeal  in  SC/WRIT/85/2018,  held  in  favour  of  the  respondents  and  quashed  the"
"Quit  Notice  first  and  thereafter  granted  relief  to  the  respondents  by  quashing  the  two  letters"
"mentioned above by the judgment delivered on the same day in CA/WRIT/358/2017. Appellants"
"impugned both these judgments of the Court of Appeal."
"W
e considered all material presented and the submissions of counsel in the course of hearing of"
"both matters that were taken up together and by our judgment in SC Appeal 112/2021 allowed"
"the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the Quit Notice issued"
"by the UDA against the respondents remains valid. The decisions impugned by the respondents"
"in  CA/WRIT/358/2017  predate the Quit  Notice  and are steps that  were taken by the UDA  and"
"other  agencies  as  a  prelude  to  the  Quit  Notice.  As  the  Quit  Notice  is  now  restored  by  the"
"judgment of this Court in SC Appeal 112/2021, it is irrational to allow the judgment of the Court"
"of Appeal that quashed the prior steps to be in force. Hence, we allow the appeal and set aside"
"the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 28.09.2020 in CA/WRIT/395/2017."
