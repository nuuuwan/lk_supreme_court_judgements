"Notification (X 22) to submit any objections thereto, for consideration. Indeed, as has"
"been  already  mentioned  above,  the  Petitioners  admittedly,  have  submitted  their"
"objections in that regard, to the 1st Respondent. In these circumstances, I have to"

"partem. Therefore, I  answer the question of law set out in paragraph 10(a) of  the"
"Petition in the negative."
