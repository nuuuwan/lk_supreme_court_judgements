"In Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka [1989] 2 Sri LR 95 at 99-100,"
"Kulatunga J. remarked:"
"Learned  Counsel  also  submitted  that  notice  of  Order  Nisi  was"
"advertised in the Newspaper as required by Section 532. That may"
"be adequate in law. However, for determining whether probate was"
"obtained  by  fraud  it  would  be  relevant  to  know  whether  having"
"regard to the circumstances of the plaintiffs, such notice afforded to"
"them  an  adequate  opportunity  of  being  aware  of  the  case  and"
"whether  the  Defendants-Appellants  kept  the  Plaintiff-Respondents"
"out of the case being aware of the fact that the Plaintiff-Respondents"
"were not likely to have read the Newspaper and become aware of"
"the testamentary case."
"On the allegations contained in the plaint the Court has to determine"
"upon evidence whether the Plaintiff-Respondents were deliberately"
"kept  in  the  dark  about  the  existence  of  the  testamentary  action  to"
"make it appear to the Court that there was no opposition to the grant"
"of probate, whether the will is a forgery and whether probate had"
"been obtained by fraud."
