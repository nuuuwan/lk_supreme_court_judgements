"the petitioner has no reason to suppose that his application will be opposed"
"by  any  person,  he  shall  file  with  his  petition  an  affidavit  to  that  effect.”"
"Section 528(3)(b) further states that “The petitioner shall tender with the"
"petition  the  consent  in  writing  of  such  respondents  as  consent  to  his"
"application.” Section 528(3) was further amended by the Civil Procedure"
"Code (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2010 with the introduction of section"
"528(3)(c) which requires the petitioner to tender with the petition “notices"
"on the respondents who have not consented to the application, requiring"
"them  to  file  objections  if  any,  to  the  application  on  or  before  the  date"
"specified in the notice under section 529. Such notice shall be sent by the"
"probate officer by registered post.”"
"While 
the  provisions  of  section  528  are  considered  directory,  not"
"mandatory, as held in Biyanwila v. Amarasekere and Pieris v. Wijeratne"
"[2000]  2  Sri  LR  145, 
it 
is  crucial  to  note  that  the  Court  will  not"
"countenance  willful  suppression  of  material  particulars. 
It  may  be"
"recalled that in Biyanwila case, Sirimane, J. at page 494 whilst stating"
"that 
failure 
to  strictly  comply  with  section  524 
(requisites  of  an"
"application  for  probate)  does  not  render  the  proceedings  void  ab  initio,"
"further remarked that “They are, however, voidable, and in an appropriate"
"case  a  party  may  ask  the  court  for  relief  under  section  839  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code”."
"Referring  to  the  failure  to  name  heirs  as  parties  to  the  application  for"
"probate, in Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka at page 99, Kulatunga"
"J. stated “However, such failure is a relevant fact in determining whether"
"probate had been obtained by fraud.”"
"The argument of learned President’s Counsel for the defendants that the"
"High  Court  was  wrong  to  have  followed  the  dicta  in  Adoris  v.  Perera"
"decided  under  the  old  procedure  is  devoid  of  merit.  As  I  stated  before,"
