"jurisdiction as well. In Cabassi v. Vila [1940] 64 CLR 130, Williams J. in"
"the High Court of Australia stated at page 147:"
"A  judgment  which  is  procured  by  fraud  is  tainted  and  vitiated"
"throughout.  If  the  fraud  is  clearly  proved  the  party  defrauded  is"
"entitled to have the judgment set aside in an action [Hip Foong Hong"
"v. Neotia & Co. (1918) A.C. 888; Jonesco v. Beard (1930) A.C. 298]."
"In some of the older cases in the House of Lords it has been stated"
"that where a judgment has been so obtained it may be treated as a"
"nullity [Shedden v. Patrick (1854) 1 Macq. H.L. 535; R. v. Saddlers’"
"Co. (1863) 10 H.L.C. 404]. In the last-mentioned case at page 431,"
"Willes J. said: “A judgment or decree obtained by fraud upon a court"
"binds not such court, nor any other; and its nullity upon this ground,"
"though it has not been set aside or reversed, may be alleged in a"
"collateral proceeding [Phillipson v. Lord Egremont (1844) 6 Q.B. 587;"
"Bandon v. Becher (1835) 3 Cl. & Fin. 479; Shedden v. Patrick (1854)"
"1 Macq. H.L. 535: see also Tommey v. White (1853) 4 H.L.C. 313].”"
