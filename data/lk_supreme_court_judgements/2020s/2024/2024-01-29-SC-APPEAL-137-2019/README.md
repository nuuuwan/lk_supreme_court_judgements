Argued on: 27.02.2023

Decided on: 29.01.2024

Samayawardhena, J.

Background

Wilson was the owner of the property in dispute. He had no children. He

and his wife legally adopted Rupawathie as their child. Wilson gifted the

property to Rupawathie. Rupawathie married to Ariyaratna. They too had

no children. When Rupawathie died on 10.12.2006, both her parents and

her husband had already died. Then the property should devolve on

brothers and sisters of her parents and their children, in accordance with

the Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance, No. 15 of 1876, as

amended.

Wilson has had several brothers and sisters. One of them is Dharmasena

who had 10 children. Out of those 10, one is Kiribanda and another is

the plaintiff. After Rupawathies demise, Seelawathie, the wife of

Kiribanda, filed testamentary case No. 2684/07/08 in the District Court

of Mt. Lavinia (as seen from the administrative conveyance No. 300 dated

30.04.2006 marked P5), on the basis that Kiribanda, and Rupawathies

husbands brother and sister are the only three heirs of Rupawathie.

5

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

Although the plaintiff and Kiribanda are brothers and the plaintiff is in

possession of the property in dispute and the plaintiff also was an heir of

Rupawathie, the plaintiff was not made a party to the testamentary case.

The District Court granted letters of administration to Seelawathie and

Seelawathie in turn transferred the property in dispute to the said three

parties by the aforesaid administrative conveyance, which was registered

in the land registry.

The plaintiff filed the instant action against the six defendants including

the aforementioned three parties in the testamentary case, on the basis

that Seelawathie fraudulently filed the testamentary action and obtained

orders in her favour without disclosing the lawful heirs of the deceased,

including himself. He sought cancellation of the administrative

conveyance P5 as the main relief.

The defendants do not deny that the plaintiff is an heir of Seelawathie

and he (the plaintiff) is in possession of the property. They took up the

position in the District Court that the testamentary action was concluded

following the proper procedure and therefore the plaintiff could not

challenge the executive conveyance in a separate action.

After the closure of the plaintiffs case, the defendants closed their case

without leading any evidence.

The learned District Judge by judgment dated 20.05.2013 dismissed the

plaintiffs action for want of jurisdiction on the sole basis that the plaintiff

ought to have made the application for recalling letters of administration

in the same testamentary proceedings in terms of sections 537 and 538

of the Civil Procedure Code rather than filing a separate action to cancel

the executive conveyance.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court and directed the District Court to enter the judgment in

6

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

favour of the plaintiff on the basis that, in the circumstances of this case,

a separate action can be maintained to cancel the executive conveyance.

The High Court relied on the Full Bench decision in Adoris v. Perera

(1914) 17 NLR 212.

This Court has granted leave to appeal on several questions but learned

Presidents Counsel for the defendant-appellants at the argument

correctly acceded that the essential question to be decided on this appeal

is:

Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law when it decided that

the plaintiff could seek to cancel the executive conveyance prepared

on letters of administration issued by another Court without making

an application under sections 537 and 538 of the Civil Procedure

Code to recall letters of administration in the previous action?

The principal submission of learned Presidents Counsel for the

defendants is that the dicta in Adoris v. Perera are inapplicable to the

facts of the instant case since the law was changed by Civil Procedure

Code (Amendment) Act, No. 14 of 1993.

The law relating to the recalling of probate was extensively discussed by

me in the case of Sammuarachchi v. Siriwardhena and Others [2021/22]

BLR 469.

The question in this case revolves around the recalling of letters of

administration.

The mode of application for letters of administration

If a person dies without leaving a last will having left property in Sri Lanka

exceeding four million rupees, administration of such property is

compulsory. Any person interested in administering the property can

7

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

apply for the grant of letters of administration. If no one is forthcoming,

the Court can appoint some person.

Sections 525-527 reads as follows:

525. When any person shall die in Sri Lanka without leaving a will,

it shall be the duty of the widow, widower, or next of kin of such

person, if such person shall have left property in Sri Lanka

amounting to or exceeding in value four million rupees, within one

month of the date of his death to report such death to the District

Court of the district in which he shall have so died, and at the same

time to make oath or affirmation or produce an affidavit verifying the

time and place of such death, and stating if such is the fact, that the

intestate has left property within the jurisdiction of that or any other,

and in that event what court, and the nature and value of such

property.

526. When any person shall die without leaving a will or where the

will cannot be found, and such person shall have left property in Sri

Lanka-

(a) any person interested in having the estate of the deceased

administered may apply for the grant to himself of letters of

administration; or

(b) any heir of the deceased may apply for the issue of certificates

of heir ship to each of the heirs entitled to succeed to the estate

of the deceased.

Such application shall be made in accordance with section 528 to

the District Court of the district within which the applicant resides,

or within which the deceased resided at the time of his death, or

within which any land belonging to the deceaseds estate is situate.

8

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

527. In case no person shall apply for the grant of letters of

administration or for the issue of certificates of heirship, as the case

may be, and it appears to the court necessary or convenient to

appoint some person to administer the estate or any part thereof, it

shall be lawful for the court in its discretion, and in every such case

where the estate amounts to, or exceeds in value, four million rupees,

the court shall in accordance with the procedure set out in this

Chapter appoint some person, whether he would under ordinary

circumstances be entitled to take out administration or otherwise, to

administer the estate, and the provisions of sections 518 to 521, both

inclusive, shall apply, so far as the same can be made applicable, to

any such appointment.

What constitutes a proper application for letters of administration is set

out in section 528.

528(1). Every application to the District Court for grant of letters of

administration or for the issue of certificates of heirship shall be

made within three months from the date of death, and shall be made

by way of petition and affidavit, and such petition shall set out in

numbered paragraphs-

(a) the fact of the absence of the will;

(b) the death of the deceased;

(c) the heirs of the deceased to the best of the petitioners

knowledge;

(d) the details and the situation of the deceaseds property;

(e) the particulars of the liabilities of the estate;

(f) the particulars of the creditors of the estate;

(g) the character in which the petitioner claims and the facts

which justify his doing so;

9

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

(h) the share of the estate which each heir is entitled to receive,

if agreed to by the heirs.

(2) The application shall be supported by sufficient evidence to afford

prima facie proof of the material averments in the petition, and shall

name the next of kin of the deceased as respondents. If the petitioner

has no reason to suppose that his application will be opposed by

any person, he shall file with his petition an affidavit to that effect.

(3) The petitioner shall tender with the petition-

(a) proof of payment of charges to cover the cost of publication of

the notice under section 529;

(b) the consent in writing of such respondents as consent to his

application;

(c) notices on the respondents who have not consented to the

application, requiring them to file objections if any, to the

application on or before the date specified in the notice under

section 529. Such notice shall be sent by the probate officer

by registered post.

The procedure for newspaper publication and the timeline for objections

are specified in section 529.

529(1). Every application to a District Court under section 524 or 528

shall be received by the Probate Officer of the District Court, and

shall be registered in a separate register to be maintained for that

purpose by the Probate Officer who shall thereafter cause the

required publications to be made in terms of subsection (2).

(2) The Probate Officer of a District Court shall, on any day of the

week commencing on the third Sunday of every month cause a notice

10

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

in form No. 84 in the First Schedule to be published in a prescribed

local newspaper in Sinhala, Tamil and English, relating to-

(i) every application under section 524 or 528 received by that

District Court in the preceding one month; and

(ii) every application under section 524 or 528 received by that

District Court and incorporated for the first time in the notice

published in respect of such District Court in the previous

month,

so however that the information in respect of every application under

section 524 or 528 received by every District Court is published on

two separate occasions in two consecutive months.

(3) The notice published under subsection (2), shall call upon persons

having objections to the making of an order declaring any will

proved, or the grant of probate or of letters of administration with or

without the will annexed, or the issue of certificates of heirship to

any person specified in the application made under section 524 or

528, to submit their written objections, if any, supported by affidavit,

before such date as is specified in the notice, being a date not earlier

than sixty days and not later than sixty seven days from the date of

the first publication referred to in subsection (2).

(4) Copies of such objections if any, shall be forwarded by the person

making the same to the person making the application under section

524 or 528, as the case may be, and shall also be served on the

other parties named in such objections.

If no objections are received, in terms of section 531, the Court can make

an order for the grant of letters of administration to the applicant.

11

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

If objections are received, in terms of section 532-534, the Court shall

hear the parties and make a suitable order.

Recalling letters of administration

In terms of section 529, the objections to the grant of letters of

administration shall be tendered not later than sixty-seven days from the

first newspaper publication.

However, this is not the only occasion an objection could be raised

against the grant of letters of administration.

The following dicta contained in the Court of Appeal judgment in Shanthi

Goonetilake v. Mangalika [2006] 3 Sri LR 331 at 334 and made use of to

dismiss applications in limine that The first publication in terms of section

529(2) was done on 23.04.2003. Objections to the granting of letters of

administration could be entertained in terms of section 529(3) of the Civil

Procedure Code only if such objections are submitted not earlier than 60

days and not later than sixty seven days from the date of the first

publication referred to in section 529(2). However, the petitioner has not

filed any objections to the order made by Court to grant letters of

administration to the respondent as prescribed in section 529(2). When a

period of time is specified by law before the expiration of which any act

has to be done by a party in a Court of law, that Court has no jurisdiction

to permit that act to be done after the expiration of that time within which

it had to be done (Ceylon Breweries v. Fernando [2001] 1 Sri LR 270).

Therefore when the petitioner has not made an application to recall the

letters of administration within the period prescribed in section 529(3) of

the Civil Procedure Code, the petitioners application cannot be

entertained do not, with respect, represent the correct position of the

law.

12

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

The law has provided for various windows to intervene, object and make

applications for recall of probate or letters of administration beyond the

period stipulated in the newspaper publications. In point of fact, a person

cannot make an application to recall the probate or letters of

administration within the period prescribed in section 529(3) since at

that time the Court has not issued probate or letters of administration.

In Biyanwila v. Amarasekere (1965) 67 NLR 488, Sirimane J. stated at

page 494 that although some provisions of the testamentary procedure

are only directory, in an appropriate case a party may ask the court for

relief under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code.

In Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka [1989] 2 Sri LR 95 at 99-100,

Kulatunga J. remarked:

Learned Counsel also submitted that notice of Order Nisi was

advertised in the Newspaper as required by Section 532. That may

be adequate in law. However, for determining whether probate was

obtained by fraud it would be relevant to know whether having

regard to the circumstances of the plaintiffs, such notice afforded to

them an adequate opportunity of being aware of the case and

whether the Defendants-Appellants kept the Plaintiff-Respondents

out of the case being aware of the fact that the Plaintiff-Respondents

were not likely to have read the Newspaper and become aware of

the testamentary case.

On the allegations contained in the plaint the Court has to determine

upon evidence whether the Plaintiff-Respondents were deliberately

kept in the dark about the existence of the testamentary action to

make it appear to the Court that there was no opposition to the grant

of probate, whether the will is a forgery and whether probate had

been obtained by fraud.

13

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

In terms of section 537, the Court can recall the letters of administration

if the Court is satisfied that the grant of letters of administration ought

not to have been made or that events have occurred which render

administration impracticable or useless.

537. In any case where a certificate of heirship has issued, or

probate of a deceased persons will or administration of a deceased

persons property has been granted it shall be competent to the

District Court to cancel the said certificate, or recall the said probate

or grant of administration, and to revoke the grant thereof, upon

being satisfied that the certificate should not have been issued or

that the will ought not to have been held proved, or that the grant of

probate or of administration ought not to have been made; and it

shall also be competent to the District Court to recall the probate or

grant of administration, at any time upon being satisfied that events

have occurred which render the administration hereunder

impracticable or useless.

Section 537 deals with the grounds upon which letters of administration

can be recalled, and section 538 stipulates that such application shall be

made by way of summary procedure.

538. All applications for the cancellation, recall or revocation of

certificates of heirship, probate or grant of administration shall be

made by petition, in pursuance of the rules of summary procedure,

and no such application shall be entertained unless the petitioner

shows in his petition that he has such an interest in the estate of the

deceased person as entitles him in the opinion of the court to make

such application.

There is no time limit for an application under section 537 to be made.

However, if the applicant claims to have been unaware of the newspaper

14

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

publication calling for objections, such an application shall be made at

the earliest possible opportunity upon the applicant becoming aware of

the case.

In Biyanwila v. Amarasekere, the appellant became aware of the fact that

her mother had obtained probate as the executor of the last will in 1952

but about 9 years later in 1961 she came to Court challenging the last

will as a forgery. Whilst dismissing the appeal, Sirimane J. observed inter

alia at 494:

In this case however one cannot disregard the long delay on the part

of the appellant which places the respondent at an obvious

disadvantage. An order revoking probate after the lapse of such a

length of time, may even place the rights of third parties in jeopardy.

Williams on Executors and Administrators says at page 81 of the

14th edition Where a party who isentitled to call in the probate

and put the Executor to proof of the Will chooses to let a long time

elapse before he takes this step he is not entitled to any indulgence

at the hands of the Court.

Before the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 14 of 1993, which

replaced Chapter 38 titled Testamentary Actions, the testamentary

procedure had, inter alia, the following notable attributes:

(a) application for probate or letters of administration shall be made

by way of summary procedure sections 524(1), 530(1)

(b) if the court is prima facie satisfied with the application, order nisi

shall be issued in the first instance sections 526, 531

(c) such order nisi will be served on the respondents and such other

persons as the court shall think fit sections 526, 531

(d) order nisi shall be published in newspapers section 532

15

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

(e) if the petitioner has no reason to suppose that his application will

be opposed by any person, he can file with his petition an affidavit

to that effect and omit to name any person in his petition as

respondent section 525(1)

(f) in the case of an application for probate, if no respondent is named

in the petition, the court may in its discretion make the order

absolute in the first instance section 529(1)

Except for (e) above, all these features were removed by the Civil

Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 14 of 1993, and (e) was removed by the

Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 38 of 1998.

Fraud as a ground for recalling letters

Under the repealed procedure, as held by the Full Bench of the Supreme

Court in Adoris v. Perera:

When an issue of probate has followed upon an order nisi (and not

upon an order absolute in the first instance), the summary procedure

for the recall of probate provided in section 537 does not apply, and

all parties are concluded by the issue of probate. But where there is

fraud in connection with the obtaining of probate even upon an order

nisi, an independent action might be brought to set aside the

probate.

When fraud is alleged in obtaining probate on a last will in the case of

testacy or letters of administration in the case of intestacy, whether under

the old procedure or the new procedure, the person applying to recall

probate or letters of administration has two options: he can either make

the application in the same proceedings or institute a separate action.

In Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka, the Supreme Court allowed a

separate action to be maintained seeking a declaration that the last will

16

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

was a forgery and probate had been obtained by fraud. Kulatunga J.

stated at page 102:

An allegation that a will was forged intentionally to mislead the

Court to granting probate for the administration of an estate which

has in fact devolved on intestate heirs and that probate has been

obtained by persons who forged such will without disclosing the

heirs has to be viewed differently from an allegation that probate

has been obtained by mere perjury. If it were otherwise it is not clear

why our Courts have held that the proper procedure to impeach

probate obtained on a forged will is by separate action Tissera v.

Gunatilleke Hamine 13 NLR 261; Adoris v. Perera 17 NLR 212;

Biyanwila v. Amarasekera 67 NLR 488.

The defendants do not want to contest the case on the merits. They do

not say the allegation of fraud is false. Instead, they attempt to conceal

fraud by technicalities. Such stratagem is not permitted in law.

Bertram C.J. in Suppramaniam v. Erampakurukal (1922) 23 NLR 417 at

435 citing Black on Judgments Vol 1, Section 292-293 states Fraud is

not a thing that can stand even when robed in a judgment.

In Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands (1974) 80

NLR 1, Vythialingam J. at page 66 and Weeraratne J. at page 140 quoted

with approval the following dicta of Lord Denning in Lazarus Estates Ltd

v. Bearely (1956) 1 All ER 341 at 345:

No Judgment of a Court or order of a Minister can be allowed to stand

if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The

Court is careful not to find fraud unless it is specially pleaded and

proved. But once it is proved it vitiates judgments, contracts, and all

transactions whatsoever.

17

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

In Takhar v. Gracefield Developments Ltd. and Others [2019] UKSC 13, a

significant item of evidence led before the trial Court was a scanned copy

of a profit share agreement, seemingly signed by the plaintiff-appellant,

which supported the defendant-respondents case. The appellants pre-

trial application to obtain evidence from a handwriting expert was denied.

The trial Court held against the appellant. Following the trial, the

appellant engaged a handwriting expert, who stated conclusively that the

signature on the agreement had been transposed from an earlier

document. The appellant moved to have the judgment set aside on the

ground that it had been obtained by fraud. The respondents resisted it

stating that it was an abuse of process. The Court did not agree that the

claim was an abuse of process. However, the Court of Appeal set aside

that order holding that a person who seeks to have a judgment set aside

on account of fraud had to show that the fraud could not have been

discovered by reasonable diligence. The Supreme Court of the United

Kingdom did not agree with the Court of Appeal and unanimously allowed

the appeal. Lord Kerr held at para 52:

The idea that a fraudulent individual should profit from passivity or

lack of reasonable diligence on the part of his or her opponent seems

antithetical to any notion of justice. Quite apart from this, the

defrauder, in obtaining a judgment, has perpetrated a deception not

only on their opponent and the court but on the rule of law.

Lord Kerr further remarked at para 53:

It appears to me that the policy arguments for permitting a litigant to

apply to have judgment set aside where it can be shown that it has

been obtained by fraud are overwhelming.

18

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

The principle, fraud vitiates everything, is followed in Australian

jurisdiction as well. In Cabassi v. Vila [1940] 64 CLR 130, Williams J. in

the High Court of Australia stated at page 147:

A judgment which is procured by fraud is tainted and vitiated

throughout. If the fraud is clearly proved the party defrauded is

entitled to have the judgment set aside in an action [Hip Foong Hong

v. Neotia & Co. (1918) A.C. 888; Jonesco v. Beard (1930) A.C. 298].

In some of the older cases in the House of Lords it has been stated

that where a judgment has been so obtained it may be treated as a

nullity [Shedden v. Patrick (1854) 1 Macq. H.L. 535; R. v. Saddlers

Co. (1863) 10 H.L.C. 404]. In the last-mentioned case at page 431,

Willes J. said: A judgment or decree obtained by fraud upon a court

binds not such court, nor any other; and its nullity upon this ground,

though it has not been set aside or reversed, may be alleged in a

collateral proceeding [Phillipson v. Lord Egremont (1844) 6 Q.B. 587;

Bandon v. Becher (1835) 3 Cl. & Fin. 479; Shedden v. Patrick (1854)

1 Macq. H.L. 535: see also Tommey v. White (1853) 4 H.L.C. 313].

In Pieris v. Wijeratne [2000] 2 Sri LR 145 at 152, Jayawickrama J. held:

[A]lthough according to section 536 of the Civil Procedure Code an

application to recall the probate could be made only where an order

absolute in the first instance has been made, in an appropriate case,

depending on the circumstances, a court has jurisdiction to act under

section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code and make an order as may

be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process

of the Court.

The instant action was filed under the new procedure. As the law stands

today, when applications are filed seeking probate or letters of

administration, the adoption of summary procedure, issuance of order

19

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

nisi to later make it absolute, issuance of order absolute in the first

instance etc. are inapplicable. The parties have to follow neither the

summary procedure (as contemplated in chapter 24 of the Civil Procedure

Code) nor strictly the regular procedure (by way of plaint and answer) but

rather a special procedure in that the application is made by way of

petition and affidavit. The Court makes substantive orders in the nature

of order absolute after the inquiry.

For completeness, let me consider what happens:

(a) if the testator includes properties in the last will which do not

belong to him; or

(b) if the executor or administrator disposes of such properties by way

of executor conveyances; or

(c) if properties which do not belong to the deceased are included in

the inventory and disposed of in the same way unknown to the true

owners?

According to section 2(1) of the Wills Ordinance, No. 21 of 1844, as

amended, a person can include in the last will any property which belong

to him at the time of death.

2(1). It shall be lawful for any person who has reached the age of

eighteen years and residing within or outside Sri Lanka to execute a

will bequeathing and disposing any movable and immovable

property and all and every estate, right, share or interest in any

property which belong to him at the time of death and which, if not

so devised, bequeathed or disposed would devolve upon his heirs of

such person not legally incapacitated from taking the same as he

shall seem fit.

20

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

The inclusion of properties in the last will or in the inventory filed in Court

in testamentary proceedings, which the deceased did not own, does not

confer any rights upon the purported beneficiaries.

In the case of Roslin Nona v. Herat (1960) 65 CLW 55 it was held that

even if the executor or administrator sells such properties with the

authority of the Court, the buyer does not acquire title to such properties.

In Rosalin Nonas case, the administratrix applied to the District Court

for authority to sell certain immovable properties that were purportedly

owned by the deceased. Two parties intervened, contending they had

conclusive title to two lands through partition decrees and objected to the

sale. The District Court dismissed these objections. On appeal, H.N.G.

Fernando J. (later C.J.) with the agreement of T.S. Fernando J. whilst

dismissing the appeal, had this to say:

The usual restriction contained in a grant of letters, which prohibits

the sale of immovable property by an administrator without the

authority of the Court, is a measure designed for the protection of

the estate and the heirs, and not for the protection of other interests.

The grant of leave to sell is merely a release of the Administrator

from the restriction imposed in the letters, and is neither an

adjudication upon the title, if any, of the intestate or the

Administrator, nor anything equivalent to an order for a sale in

execution enforceable with the aid of the process of the court.

The common law does not prevent a person from executing a transfer

of property which may, in fact, belong or turn out to belong to

another, although, of course, the transferee in such a case acquires

no title as against the true owner. A transferee from an Administrator

cannot claim to be in any better position on the score that the transfer

was executed with the leave of the Court. If, therefore, an

administrator claims any property as being the property of estate or

21

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

as being liable to be sold in order to repay the debts of the estate or

the expenses of administration, the court does not in the

testamentary proceedings have jurisdiction to determine disputes as

to title between the administrator and third parties. The Appellants

had no right to call upon the court to adjudicate upon their claims of

unencumbered title to the two lands in question. The action, if any,

which they should take at this stage to protect their interests is not

a matter upon which they can be advised by this court.

In Kalai Kumar v. Saraswathey and Others [2005] 3 Sri LR 301, the

respondent instituted testamentary action in respect of the estate of the

deceased and the petitioner intervened to claim a certain land included

in the inventory. This was application was refused by the District Court.

Wimalachandra, J. in the Court of Appeal held at page 307:

In these circumstances when the accounting party (administrator or

probate holder) has included a property in the inventory and prima

facie if it appears to be a property not belonging to the deceased

person, in my view, the District Court must hold an inquiry as to the

genuineness of the claim of the petitioner. If the property does not

form a part of the estate of the deceased person then it is not proper

to administer the said property. Moreover, if the said property does

not form a part of the estate of the deceased then the District Court

has no jurisdiction to make any order with regard to that property.

Conversely, the omission to include any property that actually belonged

to the deceased in the inventory does not preclude the heirs from making

a claim to that property on succession.

It was held in Fernando v. Dabarera (1971) 77 NLR 127:

When an action for declaration of title to a land belonging to a

deceased persons estate is instituted by a person claiming to be a

22

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

successor in title of the deceased, section 547 of the Civil Procedure

Code does not expressly prohibit the maintenance of the action on

the ground that the name of the land is not included in the Inventory

filed in the testamentary action relating to the estate of the deceased

owner.

The application of the law to the facts of this case

There cannot be a dispute that the plaintiff is one of the heirs of the

deceased and the 1st defendant in connivance with the 2nd and 3rd

defendants suppressed it in the testamentary proceedings filed to

administer the estate of the deceased. She did not include in the petition

the details of all the heirs of the deceased to the best of her knowledge as

required by section 528. She made her husband a respondent and listed

as an heir of the deceased. However, she did not make the plaintiff who

is her husbands brother and the person in possession of the property a

respondent and did not list him as an heir. There are several other heirs

who were not made parties. The 1st defendant secured letters of

administration on the false basis that the 1st defendants husband and

the 2nd and 3rd defendants are the only lawful heirs of the deceased

Rupawathie and thereafter transferred the property in dispute to the said

three parties by executive conveyance and registered the deed in the land

registry. These are by all means fraudulent acts on the part of the 1st-3rd

defendants. The defendants did not want to give evidence at the trial to

rebut the allegation of fraud.

The intention of the legislature is clear by looking at section 528 of the

Civil Procedure Code, which sets out what an application for letters of

administration should constitute. Whilst section 528(1) requires the

petitioner to set out in the body of the petition the heirs of the deceased

to the best of the petitioners knowledge, section 528(2) states that the

petitioner shall name the next of kin of the deceased as respondents. If

23

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

the petitioner has no reason to suppose that his application will be opposed

by any person, he shall file with his petition an affidavit to that effect.

Section 528(3)(b) further states that The petitioner shall tender with the

petition the consent in writing of such respondents as consent to his

application. Section 528(3) was further amended by the Civil Procedure

Code (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2010 with the introduction of section

528(3)(c) which requires the petitioner to tender with the petition notices

on the respondents who have not consented to the application, requiring

them to file objections if any, to the application on or before the date

specified in the notice under section 529. Such notice shall be sent by the

probate officer by registered post.

While the provisions of section 528 are considered directory, not

mandatory, as held in Biyanwila v. Amarasekere and Pieris v. Wijeratne

[2000] 2 Sri LR 145, it is crucial to note that the Court will not

countenance willful suppression of material particulars. It may be

recalled that in Biyanwila case, Sirimane, J. at page 494 whilst stating

that failure to strictly comply with section 524 (requisites of an

application for probate) does not render the proceedings void ab initio,

further remarked that They are, however, voidable, and in an appropriate

case a party may ask the court for relief under section 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code.

Referring to the failure to name heirs as parties to the application for

probate, in Actalina Fonseka v. Dharshani Fonseka at page 99, Kulatunga

J. stated However, such failure is a relevant fact in determining whether

probate had been obtained by fraud.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the defendants that the

High Court was wrong to have followed the dicta in Adoris v. Perera

decided under the old procedure is devoid of merit. As I stated before,

24

SC/APPEAL/137/2019

when fraud is alleged, there is no difference between the old procedure

and the new procedure.

In any event, the plaintiff did not file this action seeking to recall letters

of administration. He filed the action seeking to cancel the executor

conveyance on the ground of fraud and seeking a declaration that he is

a co-owner of the property. As Lascelles C.J. stated in Adoris v. Perera at

page 214 These provisions, of course, in no way effect the general

jurisdiction of the Court to entertain actions to set aside judgments that are

vitiated by fraud.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel that the District Judge

came to the firm finding that there was no fraud is also not correct. What

the District Judge has stated in the judgment is that he who asserts fraud

must prove it and not that the plaintiff has not proved fraud. The District

Judge did not decide on the question of fraud on the erroneous basis that

the Court had no jurisdiction to grant relief in a separate action.

Conclusion

I answer the question of law in the negative.

The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is affirmed and the appeal

is dismissed with costs.
