"in  that  case.  Thus,  both  judgments  in  R. Sampanthan’s  case,  have  rejected  the  above"
"argument put forward by the Hon. Attorney General. Six out of seven Judges of this Court"
"had concurred with the then Chief Justice when he stated the following in his judgment:"
"“Finally, it has to be observed that the acceptance of the submission made by the"
"Hon. Attorney General will render the first proviso to Article 35 (1) meaningless for"
"the most part. That is because the President has an array of duties, powers and"
"f
unctions under the Constitution and many of the acts done or omitted to be done"
"by the President in his official capacity will relate to his duties, powers and functions"
"under the Constitution. Thus, if the submission made on behalf of the Hon."
"Attorney General is carried to its logical end, the result will be the emasculation of"
"the first proviso to Article 35 (1). That cannot be permitted by this Court which"
"must honour its constitutional duty under Article 4 (d) and vigorously protect the"
"totality of its jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights conferred by"
"Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 of the Constitution.”"
