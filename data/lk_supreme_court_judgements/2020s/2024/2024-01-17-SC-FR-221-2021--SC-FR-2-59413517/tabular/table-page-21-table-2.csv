"“The immunity conferred by Article 35 is neither absolute nor perpetual. While"
"Article 35 (1) appears to prohibit the institution or continuation of legal proceedings"
"against the President, in respect of all acts and omissions (official and private),"
"Article 35 (3) excludes immunity in respect of the acts therein described. It does"
"so in two ways. First, it completely removes immunity in respect of one category"
"o
f
 acts (by permitting the institution of proceedings against the President"
"personally); and second, it partially removes Presidential immunity in respect of"
"another category of acts, but requires that proceedings be instituted against the"
"Attorney-General. What is prohibited is the institution (or continuation) of"
"proceedings against the President. Article 35 does not purport to prohibit the"
"i
nstitution of proceedings against any other person, where that is permissible under"
"any other law”…21"
