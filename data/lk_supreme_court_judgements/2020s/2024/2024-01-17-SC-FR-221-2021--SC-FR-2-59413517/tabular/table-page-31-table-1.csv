"above reasons, I reject the above contention advanced by the learned Attorney"
"General”."
"H. N. J. Perera CJ in R. Sampanthan’s case, adopted the ‘maxim expressio unius est exclusio"
"a
l
terius’ which enunciates the principle of interpretation that the specific mention of only one"
"item in a list implies the exclusion of other items in order to fortify his conclusion contained in"
"the following paragraph:"
"“It appears to me that this is an appropriate instance in which the maxim should"
"be applied to raise the inference that the exclusion of the power to declare War"
"and Peace under Article 33 (2) (g) from the ambit of the Proviso to Article 35(1)"
"o
f
 the Constitution denotes that all the other powers of the President which are"
"l
i
sted in Article 33 (2) are, subject to review by way of an application under Article"
"126 in appropriate circumstances which demand the Court‘s review of those"
"powers”.39"
"Thus,  all  seven  Judges  of  this  Court  in  the  two  judgments  referred  to  above,    in  R."
"Sampanthan’s case,  have rejected the argument that there are some powers which are vested"
"in the President which are not subject to review by this Court by way of proceedings under"
"Article 126 of the Constitution in appropriate circumstances."
"I agree with the above conclusion reached in the seven-judge bench judgment of this Court."
"I have no reason to disagree with Their Lordships. Thus, I reject the argument that the grant"
"of a pardon  to an offender by the President is  not  reviewable by this Court  in terms of its"
"jurisdiction under Article 126 read with the proviso to Article 35 of the Constitution."
"In view of the previous conclusions arrived at by fuller benches of this court particularly in the"
"more  recent  times  in R. Sampanthan’s  case,  I  really  do  not  have to  consider  in  depth  the"
"foreign judgments cited before us by the learned President’s Counsel who appeared for the"
"Petitioners as well as for the Respondents. As I have mentioned before, the foreign judgments"
"would have only a persuasive value in the absence of any clear conclusion by our Courts on a"
"certain matter. But here, it is not the case. As has been shown above, the points agitated by"
"the learned President’s Counsel for some of the Respondents have been considered and clearly"
"decided by this Court in its previous judgments. Thus, suffice it to repeat here that I agree"
"with those previous decisions made by this Court."
