"In Edward Francis William Silva’s case, in the majority judgment of the seven Judge bench of"
"this Court refused Leave to Proceed in that case, on the basis that the petitioners in that case"
"had  not  only  failed  to  establish,  prima  facie,  that  there  was  no  co-operation  between  the"
"President and the Chief Justice but had also failed to indicate how they propose to supply that"
"deficiency. It was on that basis that Fernando J in that case, in the majority judgment of this"
"Court held that it was futile to grant Leave to Proceed in respect of the alleged infringement"
"of their Fundamental Rights under Article 14(1) (g), which the petitioners in that case had"
"alleged as having resulted from that alleged want of co-operation. Even in that case, Fernando"
"J in the majority judgment of this Court had stated the fact that this Court in common with"
"Courts  in  other  democracies  founded on the  Rule  of Law,  has  consistently  recognized that"
"there  are  no  absolute  or  unfettered  discretions  in  public  law;  discretions  are  conferred  on"
"public functionaries in trust for the public; to be used for the public good; the propriety of the"
"exercise of such discretions  should be judged by  reference to the purposes for which they"
"were so entrusted. It is noteworthy that the majority of the seven Judge bench of this Court"
"did not opt to base their decision to refuse to grant Leave to Proceed and dismiss that case"
"on the basis adopted in the minority judgment. Thus,  the majority of the seven Judge bench"
"of this Court in that case, had opted not to endorse the view that an act or omission of the"
"President is not justiciable in a Court of law on the then existed Article 35 of the Constitution."
"Wade & Forsyth in their work on Administrative Law (Twelfth Edition) has also highlighted"
"the fact that the other democracies founded on the Rule of Law, has recognized that there"
"are no absolute or unfettered discretions in public law (as referred to above, by Fernando J in"
"Edward Francis William Silva’s case).  This  could  be  seen  in  the  following  two  paragraphs"
