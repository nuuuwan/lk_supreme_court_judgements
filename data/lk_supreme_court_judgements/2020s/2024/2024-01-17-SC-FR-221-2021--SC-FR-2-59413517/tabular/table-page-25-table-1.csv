"""While any person holds office as President, no proceedings shall be instituted or"
"continued against him in any Court or tribunal in respect of anything done or omitted"
"to be done by him either in his official or private capacity."""
"The five Judges of the bench of this Court in that case,  was unanimous and proceeded to"
"hold  thus:  “Although the President's immunity remains inviolable, her acts under certain"
"c
i
rcumstances, may not.”  The judgment (by Wadugodapitiya, J) proceeded to further state"
"as follows:"
"“This case confirms the proposition that the President's acts cannot be challenged"
"i
n
 
a
 
Court of law in proceedings against the President. However, where some other"
"o

 performs an executive or administrative act violative of any person's"
"f
undamental rights, and in order to justify his own conduct, relies on an act done"
"by the President, then, such act of such officer, together with its parent act are"
"reviewable in appropriate judicial proceedings.”  29"
"In the course of arriving at that conclusion, Wadugodapitiya J in Victor Ivan’s  case,30 stressed"
"the point that the President, even though he holds high office, is, nevertheless by virtue of"
"Article 42 of the Constitution, responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and"
"discharge of her constitutional powers, duties and functions."
"As has already been mentioned above, both the above cases (Edward Francis William Silva’s"
"case and Victor Ivan’s  case) relied upon by the learned President’s Counsel who appeared for"
"the recipient of the pardon in the instant case, are judgments decided by this Court before"
"the 19th Amendment. Then existed Article 35 of the Constitution had at that time conferred"
"immunity on the President leaving no room for any person to file a petition under Article 126"
"in  respect  of  anything  done  or  omitted  to  be  done  by  the  President.  Thus,  it  was  in  the"
"presence of that provision that this Court had proceeded to hold that some acts or omission"
"of 
the  President  cannot  be  challenged  under  certain  circumstances.  Therefore, 
those"
"judgments  are  not  directly  relevant  to  Article  35  of  the  Constitution  in  the  present  form."
"However,  we  agree  with  the  submission  made  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"recipient  of the pardon  that  it is important for this Court to ensure maintaining the comity"
"between the Judiciary and Executive as has been stressed in  Edward Francis William Silva’s"
