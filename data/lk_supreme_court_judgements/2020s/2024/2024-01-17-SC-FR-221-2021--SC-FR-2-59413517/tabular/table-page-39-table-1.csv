"16) In these circumstances I urge that I be excused from participating in these"
"proceedings.‚Äù"
"I need to mention here that my endeavor at this stage, is to try and find reasons which may"
"have prompted the former President to make the decision to grant the impugned pardon. Four"
"such reasons can be gleaned from 1R7 and the above affidavit filed by the former president."
"They are as follows:"
"i.  He had acted bona fide and in the interest of the country."
"ii.  He had followed the due process."
"iii.  He had considered the material placed before him."
"iv.  He had exercised his discretion correctly."
"Let me now turn to the above mentioned first reason. When the former President decided to"
"grant the pardon which is impugned in the instant case, what is the interest of the country he"
"had taken into consideration? To my mind, two sources can reveal this to Court. Firstly, the"
"former President himself because it is only he who knows as to what he himself has stated in"
"his affidavit. Secondly, the documentation that the former President would have left in the"
"Presidential Secretariat when he relinquished his office. Indeed, the former President in his"
"affidavit,  has  stated  that  the  documents  that  were  tendered  to  him  should  be  at  the"
"Presidential Secretariat. However, Pursuant to the interim order made by this Court on 31-05-"
"2022, Hon. Attorney General had only submitted to this Court, the documents 1R1 to 1R7"
"which I have already set out  above. Although the said interim order has directed the Hon."
"Attorney General to submit to this Court, the record pertaining to granting of the impugned"
"pardon,  other  than  the above  documents,  there  is    no  such  record  submitted  by  the  Hon."
"Attorney  General  for  the  perusal  of  this  Court.  Be  that  as  it  may,  none  of  the  documents"
"submitted by the Hon. Attorney General has ever indicated that the granting of the impugned"
"pardon  was  based  on  such  a  reason.  Such  basis  is  not  discernible  even  as  an  underlying"
"reason. Thus, this position taken up by the former President is not supported either by himself"
"or by the other documentation before this Court. Therefore, I am unable to accept that the"
"former  President  had  acted  in  the  interest  of  the  country  when  he  decided  to  grant  the"
"impugned pardon."
"The second reason above mentioned is the fact that the former President had followed the"
"due  process.  The  former  President  has  asserted  this,  both  in  paragraph  06  and  07  of  his"
"affidavit.  While  paragraph  07  is  a  straightforward  sentence,  formulation  of  paragraph  07"
"appears to have been carefully couched in the exact wordings found in the Proviso to Article"
