"There is no dispute that the Constitution has vested such power in the hands of the President"
"to grant a pardon to an offender who is under death sentence imposed by court in terms of"
"Article 34(1) of the Constitution. The complaint made before this Court by the Petitioners in"
"these Petitions, is that there is a fetter on the said power vested in the President. The proviso"

"Accordingly, the President is bound by the proviso to Article 34 of the constitution, to follow"
"the steps  mentioned therein, before he decides to  grant  a pardon to  an offender who has"
"been sentenced to death by a court. It is prudent to identify the said steps which I proceed"
"to mention below."
