"produced a copy of this request marked P8 with her petition. The letter by the Bar Association"
"P8 is dated 24-06-2021; it is this letter 1R7 that has referred to the letter dated 24-06-2021."
"Thus,  it  is  clear  that  this  letter  1R7  has  been  written  very  much  after  the  conclusion  of"
"granting  the  impugned  pardon.  Even  in  1R7,  the  Secretary  to  the  President  has  neither"
"divulged as to when the former President had granted the impugned pardon nor divulged the"
"reasons upon which it was granted."
"Leave alone reasons for granting the impugned pardon to its recipient, shouldn’t the relevant"
"Respondents have produced before this court, at least a minute in the relevant file (if there"
"was any), for the perusal of the court, before making submissions to justify that it was for"
"good reasons that the former President had made such a decision? Thus, it is the situation"
"before us in the instant case that we have to start looking for the decision of granting the"

"We have already held that the grant of a pardon to an offender by the President is reviewable"
"by this Court in terms of its jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution. As has already"
"been mentioned above, the President of the Republic is duty bound to ensure the compliance"
"of the provision in Article 4 (d) when he exercises sovereign power of people provided for in"
"Article  4  (b)  as  he  is  elected  by  the  People.  As  Ranasinghe  J  stated  in  Edirisuriya  Vs."
"Navaratnam,40  a  solemn  and  sacred  duty  has  been  imposed  by  the  Constitution  upon  this"
"Court, as the highest Court of the  Republic, to  safeguard  the  fundamental  rights  which"
"have    been  assured  by  the    Constitution  to  the  citizens  of  the  Republic  as  part  of  their"
"intangible heritage. How can this Court safeguard  the  fundamental  rights  of the citizens of"
