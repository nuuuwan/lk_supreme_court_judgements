"that the former President had indeed decided to grant the impugned pardon on that basis. In"
"any case, I have held before that the Respondents have failed even to produce the decision"
"of the President of the country to grant the impugned pardon to the recipient. I also have not"
"been able to fish out a single reason as the basis on which the former President had decided"
"to grant the impugned pardon to the recipient. In such a scenario, I find it impossible if not"
"difficult to accept the reasons/justifications submitted by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel who"
"appeared  for  the  recipient  of  the  pardon  as  the reasons/justifications the  former President"
"may have had for his decision to grant the impugned pardon."
"I have to hold the same in regard to the argument that the former President had decided to"
"grant the impugned pardon to the recipient as he had suffered head injuries. It is relevant to"
"note here that it is the Hon. Minister of Justice who would have been in a better position to"
"ascertain the correct position regarding the health/treatment conditions of the recipient of the"
"pardon since the Prisons come under the direct purview of his Ministry. However, the Hon."
"Minister of Justice in his report had not recommended that a pardon be granted to the recipient"
"on such basis."
"Since this Court had granted Leave to Proceed in the instant case for the complaint by the"
"Petitioners that their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution"
"for equal protection of law has been infringed by the acts of the President, it is relevant for"
"me to mention about the presence of the other convicted accused in this case. If the recipient"
"of the pardon stands wrongly  convicted  as claimed by him  because one of the High Court"
"Judges in the Trial at Bar was bias, it is needless to say, that all the other accused in this case"
"also stand on similar circumstances. The question then arises as to why the former President"
"picked on just one accused, namely the recipient of the pardon in the instant case out of many"
"accused  to  grant  a  pardon  on  that  basis.  Does  such  a  move  stand  the  test  of  rationality,"
"reasonableness, intelligibility and objectivity. The answer clearly is no. Such a move adopted"
"by  the  former  President  would  be  more  indicative  of  an  arbitrary  action  rather  than  an"
"objective decision.  This  is  more so  in  the  absence  of  any  reason  either  for  the  decision to"
"grant the impugned pardon or for picking on the recipient of the pardon in the instant case"
"from amongst other accused of the case."
"I do not think I have to deal in detail, the fact that one of the judges delivering the majority"
"judgment  Hon.  M.  C.  B.  S.  Morais  had  simply  agreed  with  the  judgment  of  Hon.  Padmini"
"Ranawaka without analysing  as to why he arrived at such a decision  and  the fact that the"
"verdict was divided as they are common occurrences in our judicial system. Suffice to say that"
"there is nothing unusual or wrong in them as that is the way they happen."
