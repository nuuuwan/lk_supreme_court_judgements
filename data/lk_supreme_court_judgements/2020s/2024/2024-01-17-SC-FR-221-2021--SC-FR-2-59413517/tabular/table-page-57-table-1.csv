"as a yet another violation which has happened in the course of the pardon-granting process"
"relevant  to the instant case where the former President  had failed to comply  with the  due"
"process in granting the said impugned pardon. This too would be another reason to reject the"
"assertion by the former President that he had exercised his discretion correctly and he had"
"followed the due process in granting the impugned pardon in the instant case."
"When  the  granting  of  the  impugned  pardon  is  not  capable  of  withstanding  the  test  of"
"rationality,  reasonableness,  intelligible  and  objective  criteria  as  highlighted  by  the  Hon."
"Attorney General in 1R5; when the pardon is not a private act of grace from an individual"
"possessing power but is a part of the Constitutional scheme as advised by the Hon. Attorney"

"Parliament (1R2). Although the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel who appeared for the recipient"
"of  the  pardon  referred  to  some  other  requests  also,  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  has  not"
"submitted any of such requests as those having received by the President. Therefore, I have"
"to proceed on the basis that it was only those two requests which were placed before the"
"President. On the other hand, the grounds upon which whoever may have made such requests"
"are more or less similar and therefore no prejudice would be caused to the recipient of the"
