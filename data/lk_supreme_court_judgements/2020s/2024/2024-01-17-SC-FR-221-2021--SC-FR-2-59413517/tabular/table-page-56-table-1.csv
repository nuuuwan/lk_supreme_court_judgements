"""Sovereignty,  which ordinarily means power or more specifically"
"power of the State as proclaimed in Article 1 is given another"
"d

mension in Article 3 from the point of the People to include -"
"(1)    the powers of Government."
"(2)    the fundamental rights; and"
"(3)    the franchise."
"Fundamental rights and the franchise are exercised and enjoyed"
"d
i
rectly by the People and the organs of government are required to"
"recognize, respect, secure and advance these rights."
"The powers of government are separated as in most Constitutions, but"
"unique to our Constitution is the elaboration in Articles 4(a), (b) and"
"(c) which specifies that each organ of government shall exercise the"
"power of the People attributed to that organ. To make this point"
"c
l
earer, it should be noted that sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) not"
"only state that the legislative power is exercised by Parliament,"
"executive power is exercised by the President and judicial power by"
"Parliament through Courts, but also specifically state in each sub"
"paragraph that the legislative power ""of the People"" shall be exercised"
"by Parliament, the executive power ""of the People'"" shall be exercised"
"by the President and the judicial power ""of the People"" shall be"
"exercised by Parliament through the Courts. This specific reference to"
"the power of the People in each sub paragraph which relates to the"
"three organs of government demonstrates that the power remains and"
"continues to be reposed in the People who are sovereign, and its"
"exercise by the particular organ of government being its custodian for"
"the time being, is for the People (at page 98). Therefore, executive"
"power should not be identified with the President and personalized and"
"should be identified at all times as the power of the People""."
