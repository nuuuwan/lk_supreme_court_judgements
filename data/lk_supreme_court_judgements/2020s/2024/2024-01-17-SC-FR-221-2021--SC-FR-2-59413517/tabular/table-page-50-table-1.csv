"What is the effect of the non-compliance of the Hon. Attorney General’s advice to the Hon."
"Minster  of  Justice?  The  effect  of  such  non-compliance  has  been  mentioned  by  the  Hon."
"Attorney General himself in 1R5. The most important feature highlighted by the Hon. Attorney"
"General in 1R5 is that in order to grant a pardon, the former President must have reasons"
"which must be capable of being assessed objectively and those grounds should be capable of"
"withstanding  the  test  of  rationality,  reasonableness,  intelligible  and  objective  criteria.  The"
"question then is whether the exercise of power by the former President under Article 34 of"

"General’s advice;  the former President had not at all considered what the law has required"
"him  to  consider.  Thus,  I  am  unable  to  hold  that  the  former  President  had  exercised  his"
"discretion correctly."
"SECTION 3 (q) OF THE ACT NO. 04 OF 2015."
"Another Complaint made by the Petitioners is that the former president has completely ignored"
"the legal provisions in Section 3 (q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime"
"and Witnesses Act No. 04 of 2015 as amended. The said section reads as follows:"
