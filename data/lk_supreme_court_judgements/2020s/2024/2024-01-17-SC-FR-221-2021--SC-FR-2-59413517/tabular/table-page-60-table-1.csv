"CONCLUSION"
"For the foregoing reasons, I have no legal basis or even a factual basis to uphold the decision"
"made by the former President to grant a pardon to the recipient in the instant case.  I hold"
"that the said decision is arbitrary, irrational and has been made for the reasons best known"
"to the former President who appears to have not even made any written decision and has not"
"given any reason thereto. Futher, no reason can be discerned from any document submitted"
"by Hon. Attorney General as forming part of the record pertaining to the impugned grant of"
"pardon. The Petitioners are therefore entitled to succeed with their petitions."
"I proceed to grant the following relief to the Petitioners in SC FRA No. 221/ 2021, SC FRA No."
"225/ 2021 and SC FRA No. 228/ 2021:"
