"","before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, this Court had decided those cases"
"","on the basis that the then existed Article 35 of the Constitution had conferred immunity on"
"","the President leaving no room for any person to file a petition under Article 126 in respect of"

"","Let me first consider Edward Francis William Silva’s case. The petitioners in that  case, had"
"","challenged the appointment of a Judge to this Court on the basis that the President had made"
"","that  appointment without  consultation or any other form of co-operation with the judiciary"
"","namely the Chief Justice. Let me first refer to the minority judgment of that case. In refusing"

"","agreeing with him, had proceeded on the then existed Article 35 of the Constitution to hold"
"","that an act or omission of the President is not justiciable in a Court of law, more so where the"
"","said act or omission is being questioned in proceedings where the President is not a party and"
"","in law could not have been made a party because it is only the President who could furnish"
"","details relating to the said appointment. In the minority judgment Perera J had further held"
"","that  the  said  matter  cannot  be  canvassed  in  Court  when  the  Constitution  had  specifically"
"","prohibited  the  institution  of  proceedings  against  the  President,  and  the  challenge  to  that"
"","appointment cannot be isolated from the President in those proceedings since the basis for"
"that appointment falls within the purview of an act or omission of the President.",""
