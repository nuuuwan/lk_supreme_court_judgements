"Dharmasoka Vidyalaya,  further  5  marks  were  deducted  by  including  Hemamali Vidyalaya  as  a"
"school closer to his house than Mahamaya Girls College. Hence, 15 marks were deducted from"
"50. In total, the 2nd petitioner was given 85 marks out of 100 instead of 90 out of 100."
"It was further stated that the said Hemamali School is situated far away from the 1st petitioner's"
"residence, across the Udawatta Kele Sanctuary. Moreover, Clause 6.0(f) of the said Circular states"
"that marks should not be deducted if there are rivers, lagoons, marshy lands, forest etc. that restrict"
"access between a residence and a school in close proximity."
"The 1st petitioner stated that on the 7th of October, 2016, the provisional list of selected students"
"and the waiting list were displayed on the notice board of the Mahamaya Girls College and the"
"names of 85 children were displayed as selected students. The 2nd petitioner's name was displayed"
"as No. 5 in the waiting list."
"Being aggrieved by the decision not to admit the 2nd petitioner to Mahamaya Girls College, the 1st"
"petitioner forwarded an appeal to the 2nd respondent dated 17th of October, 2016. Further, the 2nd"
"respondent by her letter dated 19th of December, 2016, informed the 1st petitioner that the cut off"
"mark was 85. However, though the 2nd petitioner's mark is same as the cut off mark, her name was"
"displayed on the waiting list."
"Thereafter, on the 10th of December, 2016, the final list of selected students and the names of the"
"students in the waiting list were displayed on the notice board of the Mahamaya Girls College."
"Accordingly,  85  names  were  displayed  as  selected  students  and  the  2nd  petitioner's  name  was"
"displayed as No. 3 in the waiting list."
"The 1st petitioner stated that he has a legitimate expectation that the 2nd petitionerâ€™s name would"
"be  included  in  the  final  list  of  selected  students  as  Mahamaya  Girls  College  was  close  to  his"
"residence."
"Moreover, as the 2nd petitioner was not admitted to Mahamaya Girls College, he sent a letter to the"
"2nd respondent requesting necessary action to be taken to admit the 2nd petitioner to Year 1 of the"
"Mahamaya Girls College. However, he did not receive a response to the said letter."
