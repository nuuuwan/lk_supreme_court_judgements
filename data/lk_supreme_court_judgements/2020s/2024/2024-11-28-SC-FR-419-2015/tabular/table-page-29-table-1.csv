"e. 
 Promoting team work and leadership capabilities."
"Contesting  the  description  of  these  different  criteria,  the  Petitioner,"
"in  her 
counter 
affidavit, 
stated 
that 
the  version  presented  by 
the"
"Respondents  is  a  “improbable  and  not  credible”  one  for  it  is  clear  that  the"
"different  heading  under  which  marks  were  given  have  been  prepared  ad"
"hoc.  Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  also  brought  it  to  the"
"attention of Court that the mark sheets on which the members of the Board"
"Nomination  Committee  entered  marks  under  each  of  these  criteria    bore"
"identical  handwriting.  He 
therefore 
requests 
the  Court 
to 
reject 
the"
"explanation  of 
the  3rd  Respondent,  that  he  wrote 
them  down  on 
the"
"instructions  of  each 
  Committee  member,  as  a  highly  untenable  and"
"unlikely  scenario,  and  further  submitted  that 
it  also  demonstrates  the"
"panel  did  not  give  any  marking  contemporaneously.  Learned  President’s"
"Counsel further submitted that the identical marks given by each member"
"under each criterion, seriously undermines the credibility of the interview."
"He  referred  to  the  fact  that  the  decision  to  award  a  zero  mark  for  the"
"Petitioner  over  the  criterion  of  business  orientation  of  the  Bank  is  unfair,"
"in view of her immense contribution to “uphold the business orientation of the"
"bank”."
