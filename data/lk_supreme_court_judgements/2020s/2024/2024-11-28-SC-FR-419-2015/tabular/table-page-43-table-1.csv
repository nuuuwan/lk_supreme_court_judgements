"His Lordship thereupon reiterated once  more (also at p. 337) that “"
"… [T]he weightage for seniority must depend on the nature of the post: the greater"
"its  responsibilities, more  the  justification  for  giving greater  weightage  for  factors"
"relevant to merit and ability, and performance.”"
"Thus, 
in  view  of 
the  considerations 
I  have 
referred 
to 
in 
the"
"preceding  paragraphs,  the  impugned  selection  of  the  12th  Respondent  is"
"qualified  to  be  taken  in  as  an  instance  where  “  …  equality  of  employment"
"opportunity  admits  discrimination  with  reason  and  prohibits  discrimination"
"without  a  reason”    as  observed  by  Ranasinghe  CJ  in  Ramuppillai  v  Festus"
"Perera,  Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home"

"Another  (supra,  at  p.  256)  to  “  …  treat  the  petitioner  and  3rd  respondent  as"
"equally  entitled  to  promotion  would  be  improper,  for  it  would  result  in  treating"
"unequal’s equally.”"
"Having  dealt  with  the  issues  of  whether  the  criteria  on  which  the"
"candidates  were  assessed  and  the  intelligible  differentia    on  which  the  12th"
"Respondent  was 
recommended 
to  be  promoted, 
I  now 
turn 
to 
the"
"remaining  part  of  the  complaint  of  the  Petitioner  that  she  was  wilfully"
"discriminated  by 
the  1st  Respondent  Bank,  by  affording  preferential"
"treatment to the 12th Respondent. This was the complaint she made to the"
