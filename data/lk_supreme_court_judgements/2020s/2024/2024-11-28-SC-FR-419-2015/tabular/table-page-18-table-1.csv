"S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015"
"one held by the Petitioner, after she had switched from her original stream,"
"therefore of no significance in this context."
"The allegation levelled by the Petitioner that she was systematically"
"deprived  of  her  due  promotion,  although  she  was  the  only  qualified"
"candidate  to  the  post,  in  order  to  facilitate  the  12th  Respondent,  to  be"
"promoted  over  her,  by  placing  reliance  on  certain  events  that  has  taken"
"place  prior 
to 
the 
impugned 
interview 
therefore 
remains 
a  mere"
"unsubstantiated proposition, rather than an actual scenario that resulted in"
"an 
actual  discrimination.  Despite 
the 
repeated 
failure 
to 
secure 
a"
"promotion  to  the  required  Grade,  the  Petitioner  did  not  challenge  those"
"decisions  and  chose  to  challenge  only  when  the  12th  Respondent  was"
"promoted,  admittedly  because,  she  being  a  younger  employee,  and  with"
"the  impugned promotion  her “… entire professional career path of the Bank"
"had been blocked” (“P17”)."
"No doubt that the Petitioner is entitled to choose the stage at which"
"she would mount a  legal challenge to the validity of the alleged repeated"
"acts of deprivation of her ‘due’ promotion by the 1st Respondent Bank. But"
"when she eventually decides to take that path and tries to make out a case"
"based on systematic deprivation of equal opportunity there must be some"
"credible  material 
that  should  have  been  placed  before 
this  Court 
in"
"support that allegation,  which she failed to do in this instance. Instead, the"
"Petitioner  has  chosen  to  present  a  distorted  picture  before  this  Court  by"
"presenting  an  edited  version  of  events  with  suppression  of  material"
"factors."
