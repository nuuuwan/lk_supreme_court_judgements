"professionals who are employed by the 1st Respondent Bank are serving in"
"both these streams. The 3rd Respondent further states that, as the way the"
"12th  Respondent  opted  to  switch  from  her  original  stream  in  terms  of  the"
"said Circular, the Petitioner too could have opted to switch but did not."
"Whilst  admitting  that  the  12th  Respondent  was  promoted  to  the"
