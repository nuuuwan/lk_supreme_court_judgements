Rasika Dissanayake for the 12th Respondent. Rajiv Goonethilake DSG for the A.G. ARGUED ON : 14th December, 2021 DECIDED ON : 28th November, 2024

********* ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction conferred on this Court

under Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution by alleging infringement of

her fundamental right to equality, guaranteed to her under Article 12(1),

by the 1st to 11th Respondents in promoting the 12th Respondent to the post

of Deputy Head of Finance, over her. The Petitioner repetitively asserts in

her petition that she is the only qualified officer in the bank to apply for the

said post.

After affording an opportunity for the Petitioner to support her

application and to the Respondents to resist the same, this Court decided

to grant leave to proceed under Article 12(1) on 15.03.2016.

The Petitioner, having joined the 1st Respondent Bank as an

Accounts Assistant in June 1989, was promoted to the post of Assistant

Finance Officer on 17.04.2000 and thereafter to the Grade of Deputy

Finance Officer in 2008. During the period 1996 to 2008, she was attached

to the Audit Department. In 2008, she was transferred to the Risk

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

7

Management Department, where she covered up duties of the Grade of

Senior Manager (Operational Risk), until her promotion as a Deputy Chief

Finance Officer in February 2010. Since then, the Petitioner functioned in

that capacity attached to the Risk Management Department of the 1st

Respondent Bank. Being a Deputy Chief Finance Officer, with academic

and professional qualifications coupled with a long period of service, she

was eligible to apply to the post of Deputy Head of Finance.

It is averred by the Petitioner that since July 2009, she applied to the

management of the 1st Respondent Bank to be appointed as the Deputy

Head of Finance on three sperate occasions (2009, 2012 and 2013), upon

calling for applications from eligible candidates. She further alleged that

the 1st to 11th Respondents did not proceed to complete the selection

process by citing various reasons, and effectively shelved the necessity of

filling that post.

With the issuance of Staff Circular No. 7588/2015 of 24.08.2015,

applications were called once more to fill the post of Deputy Head of

Finance by the 1st Respondent Bank, and the Petitioner tendered her

perfected application for the only vacancy in that post. She was called for

an interview along with the 12th Respondent on 22.10.2015. No marking

scheme or criteria, which would be adopted at the interview, was

provided to the Petitioner, prior to the interview. In spite of being

confident that she was the only qualified person to be promoted to the

post, the Petitioner was dismayed to learn that the 12th Respondent has

been selected to be promoted to post of Deputy Head of Finance. The

impugned decision taken by the 1st Respondent Bank to appoint the 12th

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

8

Respondent to the only vacancy that existed in the post of Deputy Head of

Finance, resulted in negating the Petitioners future promotional prospects

completely as the former is comparatively a junior officer in service.

The 1st to 5th, 10th and 11th Respondents as well as the 12th

Respondent (being the successful candidate) have tendered their

Statements of Objection resisting the Petitioners application, and

collectively prayed for its dismissal. The Petitioner filed her counter

affidavit, challenging some of the positions taken up by the Respondents

in their respective Statement of Objections.

When this matter was taken up for hearing on 03.11.2021, learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, in support of the allegation that the

decision of the 1st to 11th Respondents to appoint the 12th Respondent to the

post of Deputy Head of Finance is unreasonable, arbitrary and

discriminatory one, has presented following submissions for the

consideration of this Court:

a. the conduct of the 1st to 11th Respondents, in their failure to

fill the disputed vacancy for a very long time by cancelling

the interviews that were scheduled twice over,

demonstrates that they were waiting for the 12th

Respondent to be promoted to the Grade of Deputy Chief

Finance Officer and thereby facilitating her to contest for

the disputed post along with the Petitioner, who has

served the 1st Respondent bank for a longer period of time,

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

9

b. the interview process in itself is bad in law as the Board

Nomination Committee of the 1st Respondent bank failed

to provide any interview criteria and thereby ensuring the

transparency of the interviewing process and its failure to

disclose the marks indicating the assessment of the

suitability of the two candidates at the close of the

interview,

c. the Board Nomination Committee failed to act in good

faith, when they prepared a set of mark sheets subsequent

to the interview, which they should have done during the

interviewing process, in order to cover up their already

made decision to appoint the 12th Respondent to the post of

Deputy Head of Finance.

In view of the detailed submissions made by the learned Presidents

Counsel in relation to each of these contentions, I intend to consider them

after dividing them into two parts. The first part would deal with the

events that had taken place prior to the interview conducted on 13.10.2015,

while the second part deals with the factors that were highlighted in

relation to the very process of the interview.

The Petitioners contention on the first part is founded upon a strong

belief entertained by her that she was repeatedly and systematically

denied of a fair opportunity to earn her due promotion, in spite of the fact

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

10

that she possessed all the requisite academic, professional qualifications

and long years of dedicated service. The Petitioner has accordingly

highlighted certain events that had taken place during this period, which

contributed to strong belief she entertains in her mind.

In making reference to these several events, she first relied on the

fact that the managements failure even to respond to her letter dated

02.07.2009, by which she made a request to appoint her to the post of

Deputy Chief Finance Officer. She tendered that request with the

recommendation of the Senior Deputy General Manager (P5). The basis of

her request was that she has covered up duties of the Grade of Senior

Manager (Operational Risk) for period of over a year.

The second instance which the Petitioner relied on has taken place in

September 2010, when applications called from eligible candidates to fill

two vacancies in the Grade of Deputy Head of Finance. The dates on

which the interviews were originally fixed rescheduled twice. The

management eventually issued a letter on 23.09.2010, stating that the

Board of Directors has decided to fill only the vacancies that are referred to

in that letter. The post of Deputy Head of Finance was not included in the

said letter and hence no interview regarding that particular post was held.

The reason for this change of mind on the part of the 1st Respondent Bank

was said to be due to the restructuring process of the organisation that was

taking place and once that is completed, the management would take steps

to re-announce the vacancies. Being the only qualified officer available at

that point of time to fill that position, the Petitioner alleged that she was

deprived of that opportunity for the second time.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

11

With the issuance of Staff Circular No. 7181/2012 on 05.04.2012, and

calling for application to fill the same post, the third in the series of such

deprivations has occurred. The Petitioner tendered her application in

compliance with the said Circular. She was called for an interview.

However, the Petitioner states that the management of the bank refrained

from filling the said vacancy for reasons unknown, despite being the only

officer in the bank who possessed the required educational and professional

qualifications to be promoted the Grade of Deputy Head of Finance....

It is her contention that these three instances, which she describes as

instances of systematic deprivation of her due promotion, should also be

viewed in the light of two more additional factors. One of them is the

change of policy made by the management of the bank from time to time

permitting or restricting its employees to switch from the Mainstream to

the Finance officers Service or from the Finance officers Service to the

Mainstream. The other factor the Petitioner relied on was the

circumstances under which the 12th Respondent was promoted to the

Grade of Deputy Chief Finance Officer, and thereby facilitating her to be a

competitor by occupying a position similar to the one held by the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that the officers of the 1st Respondent bank are

generally separated into two streams. The two streams are referred to as

Close Service and Main Stream. Promotions of the two streams would

run parallel but, independently of each other. Generally, the professionals

who joined the bank are grouped into the Close Service. In terms of Staff

Circular No. 283/1987, no switching was permitted to Finance Officers

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

12

from Main Stream to the Close Service. However, with the issuance of

Staff Circular No. 387/2008, the preceding Staff Circular No. 283/1987

was cancelled and, as a result, officers of the Main Stream could switch to

the Close Service. The Staff Circular No. 392/2008, introduced another

change of policy by permitting the Finance Officers of the Main Stream to

switch to Close Service at a higher level, even as Senior Finance Officer, by

removing the restriction imposed by the earlier circular that they could do

so only at the initial level of Finance Officers service, namely, Assistant

Finance Officer Grade III.

After the issuance of the Staff Circular No. 387/2008, the 12th

Respondent, who was originally serving in the Main Stream, has switched

to Close Service, in 2008 itself and that too as a Senior Finance Officer. The

12th Respondent was thereafter promoted to the Grade of Deputy Chief

Finance Officer, a post similar to the one held by the Petitioner, even

though the former is much junior in her service. Some of these factual

assertions were refuted by the 1st to 5th, 10th and 11th Respondents as well

as by the 12th Respondent.

In his Statement of Objections, tendered by the 3rd Respondent, on

behalf of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 10th and 11th Respondents, it was averred that

after applications were called to fill the two vacancies in the Grade of

Deputy Chief Finance Officer in terms of Staff Circular No. 6822/2009, the

Petitioner was promoted to that post w.e.f. 05.02.2010. This relates to the

first instance complained by the Petitioner in support of her complaint of

systematic deprivation of her due promotion.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

13

In relation to the second instance, the 3rd Respondent states that,

despite the rescheduling of the interviews for the Grade of Deputy Chief

Finance Officer pending restructuring of the 1st Respondent Bank, the

management nonetheless conducted interviews on 27th and 28th of

September 2010, in which the Petitioner too has participated along with

several other candidates. The Petitioner was however unsuccessful in

securing a position to be among the nine successful candidates, who were

promoted. The extracts of the Minutes of the Board of Directors were

tendered as 3R4 in support of that assertion. The 3rd Respondent

therefore accused the Petitioner of intentionally supressing material factors

in her petition addressed to this Court.

In relation to the alleged third instance of deprivation of a

promotional opportunity, the 3rd Respondent once again accused her of

intentionally supressing material factors. The 3rd Respondent states that

the Petitioner was in fact interviewed for the only vacancy that existed in

that post. The management was however not impressed with her

performance at the interview and therefore decided not to fill the vacancy,

as she was found to be not suitable to be promoted to the post. The extracts

of Minutes of the Board of Nomination Committee of 31.03.2014 are

tendered annexed to the Statement of Objections as 3R5.

The 3rd Respondent, in his affidavit, offers a clarification as to the

two streams that exists in the 1st Respondent Bank, which the first is

termed as the Main Banking Stream while the other is termed as Non-

Banking Stream respectively, and it is the Non-Banking Stream which

casually referred to as the Close Service. He further states that

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

14

professionals who are employed by the 1st Respondent Bank are serving in

both these streams. The 3rd Respondent further states that, as the way the

12th Respondent opted to switch from her original stream in terms of the

said Circular, the Petitioner too could have opted to switch but did not.

Whilst admitting that the 12th Respondent was promoted to the

Grade of Deputy Chief Finance Officer, a post similar to the one held by

the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent states that the incumbent officers at the

tier of Deputy Chief Finance Officer are eligible to be promoted to the

Grade of a AGM, but are appointed primarily on performance of the

individual applicant, rather than merely on the period of service in the 1st

Respondent bank.

The counter affidavit of the Petitioner reveals that she now admits

that she was called for an interview in July 2010, but reiterates her claim

made in the petition once more. In replying to the job description of the

post of Deputy Head of Finance, tendered by the 3rd Respondent as 3R6,

the Petitioner claims that it was formulated only in January 2016, and that

too after the instant application was filed before this Court. The Petitioner

points out that the position now taken up by the 3rd Respondent, that the

length of service is of little relevance to be promoted, primarily meant to

cover up its own lapse in promoting a person with lessor experience. She

further alleged that the explanation of the 3rd Respondent, as to the marks

entered by the three members of the Board Nomination Committee in

respect of the two contestants, reflect that they have allocated identical

marks under each different criterion for both candidates. The Petitioner

thereby claims that is a factor that seriously undermines the credibility of

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

15

the interview process. Therefore, the Petitioner contends that the sequence

of events, as averred by the 3rd Respondent, is improbable and not

credible.

Perusal of the related documents, in the light of the factual

averments of the Petitioner as well as of the 3rd and 12th Respondents, the

complaint of the Petitioner that she was denied of her promotion in 2009

for the first time, when the management made no response to her request,

revealed that the management would promote an officer only when a

vacancy is publicised by way of issuance of a Staff Circular. By calling

applications from those who are eligible, the management would select the

candidates and that too after an interview. The Petitioners contention that

the failure to acknowledge her request to be considered for a promotion, in

relation to the 1st instance of alleged deprivation of promotion, is an

instance where she did not comply with that established procedure but

made a request instead. I find it difficult to accept that allegation as a one

that has been substantiated in view of the material available. She herself

admits that there was no vacancy notified by way of a Staff Circular,

before she made her request for a promotion. Nonetheless, she was duly

promoted to that post, but after the issuance of Staff Circular No.

6822/2009, and thereby following the proper procedure.

The allegation that the Petitioner has deliberately suppressed

material particulars and made misrepresentations in her petition as to the

circumstances related to the alleged deprivation of her promotion for the

second time, therefore appears to be a one which is substantiated with

documentary evidence. The Petitioner stated in her petition that in 2010,

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

16

after rescheduling the interviews twice, the management of the bank

refrained from filling the said vacancy for reasons unknown, despite she is the

only officer in the bank who possessed the required educational and professional

qualifications to be promoted the Grade of Deputy Head of Finance.... The 3rd

Respondent effectively countered this claim and stated that the

management did in fact conduct interviews on 27th and 28th of September

2010 for that post. The Petitioner too was called along with several other

candidates for the interviews. The fact that the Petitioner was unsuccessful

in securing a position among nine successful candidates, who were

promoted consequent to that interview, was not disclosed in her petition.

Her allegation that she was deprived her promotion is made upon

suppression of that fact, which, had she chosen to disclose in the first

place, would not have supported that claim. The extract of the Minutes of

the Board of Directors containing the said selection process is tendered by

the 3rd Respondent, marked as 3R4. It is a contemporaneous document

and therefore an item of strong and reliable evidence in this regard.

In terms of the said document 3R4, the interview panel has

interviewed a total of 39 candidates. Each of them was allocated marks by

following a common but a structured marking scheme. The successful

candidates were selected by totalling the marks allocated to each of them

by the three members of the Committee and in the order of merit, judging

from the final total. The fact that the Petitioners name is not included in

the list of successful candidates is clear proof that she failed to satisfy the

required criteria for the promotion. The Petitioner is bound to disclose the

true facts, even though the disclosure may not have supported her cause.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

17

The Petitioner, having presented an edited version of facts, and making an

allegation that she was denied of her promotion for the second time on

that misrepresented set of facts, displayed a conduct which is not an

acceptable from a person who complaints of infringement of fundamental

rights and seeking an equitable remedy.

Similarly, the allegation of the third act of deprivation a promotional

opportunity, as complained by the Petitioner is tainted with intentionally

supressing material factors. The 3rd Respondent states that the Petitioner

was in fact interviewed as the only candidate for that post, but the Board

of Nomination Committee was not impressed with her performance and

therefore decided not to fill the vacancy of AGM- Finance. The 3rd

Respondent too was present during the interview process and has

vouched for the accuracy of these facts from his personal knowledge. He

has tendered the extracts of Minutes of the Board of Nomination

Committee of 31.03.2014 annexed to the Statement of Objections as 3R5.

Turning to consider the allegations levelled at the management of

the 1st Respondent bank that, it facilitated the 12th Respondent to change

her stream and thereby paved the way so that she could be promoted over

the Petitioner, it must be noted in this regard that the Petitioner did not

challenge the promotion of the 12th Respondent to the Grade of Deputy

Chief Finance Officer, nor did she mount any challenge to the propriety of

the latters act of switching of streams, in terms of a Staff Circular. The

refences that were made to the existence of the two streams and also to the

fact that the 12th Respondent was given a promotion to a post similar to the

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

18

one held by the Petitioner, after she had switched from her original stream,

therefore of no significance in this context.

The allegation levelled by the Petitioner that she was systematically

deprived of her due promotion, although she was the only qualified

candidate to the post, in order to facilitate the 12th Respondent, to be

promoted over her, by placing reliance on certain events that has taken

place prior to the impugned interview therefore remains a mere

unsubstantiated proposition, rather than an actual scenario that resulted in

an actual discrimination. Despite the repeated failure to secure a

promotion to the required Grade, the Petitioner did not challenge those

decisions and chose to challenge only when the 12th Respondent was

promoted, admittedly because, she being a younger employee, and with

the impugned promotion her entire professional career path of the Bank

had been blocked (P17).

No doubt that the Petitioner is entitled to choose the stage at which

she would mount a legal challenge to the validity of the alleged repeated

acts of deprivation of her due promotion by the 1st Respondent Bank. But

when she eventually decides to take that path and tries to make out a case

based on systematic deprivation of equal opportunity there must be some

credible material that should have been placed before this Court in

support that allegation, which she failed to do in this instance. Instead, the

Petitioner has chosen to present a distorted picture before this Court by

presenting an edited version of events with suppression of material

factors.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

19

After arriving at the said finding on the segment that covered the

series of incidents up to the interview by which the 12th Respondent was

selected, I shall now move on to the core of her complaint presented before

this Court, in which she alleged that the said interviews process is bad in

law in its entirety. The Petitioner contended the interview process is liable

to be quashed for following reasons:

a. the Bank did not provide any marking scheme or criteria

prior to the interview and thereby failed to ensure that the

interview process is a transparent one,

b. each of the panellists who interviewed has failed to assess

her merits independently,

c. the selection criteria contained in paragraph 13 is unfair,

d. the award of zero marks to the Petitioner over the

assessment criteria business orientation of the Bank is

unfair,

e. the justification of the Respondents in their failure to

promote her due to incompetence, when her

Performance Appraisal form indicates that she is

Committed and Hard Working,

f. the allegation the Petitioner did not possess any experience

relating to the duties of Deputy Head of Finance is wrong,

g. that the interview panel should have allocated 30% of

marks for her seniority in the Final Marking Sheet 3R20.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

20

These multiple grounds could conveniently be dealt with by

considering them after grouping them under three headings. The

Petitioners first concern is in the very process of interviewing, in which

she alleged to have been treated unequally, unfairly and discriminately in

comparison with her only other competitor, the 12th Respondent. She also

heavily relies on her qualifications by repetitively asserting that she is the

most qualified candidate for the post as the second head. She thirdly relies

on her long service record with the 1st Respondent bank, which, according

to her, should have been given adequate weightage by the panel, much

more than it did, at the interview.

Before venturing to consider her contention under these three

headings, I wish to make a brief reference to the underlying principle of

law on which she has premised her complaint to this Court. Primarily the

Petitioner seeks a declaration from this Court that her fundamental rights

guaranteed to her under Article 12(1) were violated by the Respondents.

Article 12(1) confers a fundamental right on all persons assuring that they

are all equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of the law.

What Article 12(1) envisage in terms of equality is described by

Ranasinghe CJ in Ramuppillai v Festus Perera, Minister of Public

Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and Others (1991)

1 Sri L.R. 11 (at p. 19) as among equals, the law should be equal and it

should be equally administered: that like should be treated alike: that all persons

are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law: that no

citizen shall be discriminated against on grounds of race, religion, language, casts,

sex, political, opinion, place of birth or any of such grounds. Founded upon

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

21

this principle, this Court in Samarasinghe v Air Lanka Ltd., and Others

(1996) 1 Sri L.R. 259, in relation to recruitment and promotions in the

public sector, noted that (at p. 276), [T]his Court has, in dealing with

the equality provisions of the Constitution, insisted that while there should be

proper schemes of recruitment and promotion, their implementation should not be

tainted by caprice, bias or prejudice. Favouritism on the one hand or the evil eye

on the other, necessarily militate against the very concept of equality and should,

therefore, be abhorred. There must, in the public interest, always be honesty,

openness, and transparency in regard to executive or administrative acts. In the

judgment of Perera and Others v Monetary Board of Central Bank of Sri

Lanka (1994) 1 Sri L.R. 152, this Court further observed (at p. 167) that

[A] scheme of promotion must be justifiable in its formulation and just in its

application. The law insists on justice and this, among other things, means that in

the exercise of authority or power there must be just conduct. In the exercise of the

power of recruitment, just conduct entails the even-handed treatment of those who

might be affected by the exercise of a power.

In the light of the principles enunciated in these judicial

pronouncements, I now proceed to consider the validity of the

interviewing process adopted by the 1st Respondent Bank. In terms of the

Banking Act No. 11 of 2007, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has published a

set of directions applicable to all licensed commercial banks coming under

its purview. The said set of directions 3R3, provide for different

committees to be appointed by the Board of Directors of those banks,

under Rule No. 3(6)(i), and one such committee is for the purpose of

making nominations.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

22

The 1st Respondent bank, in compliance of the said Rule, appointed

Committees consisting of different members each time it called for

applications to fill vacancies that exists in its senior management level.

Such a Nomination Committee is empowered to implement a procedure to

select/appoint new directors, CEO and key management personnel and also

empowered to set the criteria such as qualifications, experience and key

attributes required for eligibility to be considered for appointment or promotion to

the post of CEO and key management positions in terms of Rule 3(6)(iv)(a)

and (c) of the said set of Directives (emphasis added).

There is no dispute that the post of Deputy Head of Finance indeed

qualifies to be taken as a key management position in the 1st Respondent

Bank. In terms of the Organisational Structure of the 1st Respondent bank

3R10, the two Deputy Heads of Finance are expected to report directly to

their immediate senior, the Head of Finance, who reports to the Chief

Executive Officer/General Manager. Thus, the post of Deputy Head of

Finance was placed in the third tier of key management positions of the 1st

Respondent Bank. Being a position in the senior management, and termed

as a key management position, the competence of the incumbent holder of

the position has a significant bearing on the overall performance of the 1st

Respondent Bank. Due to the impact that post would make on its affairs of

the 1st Respondent Bank, unlike in the case of a lower grade officer, whose

performance affects the organisation only in a limited sphere, it is

reasonable to add more on weightage on competency than mere long

service and seniority. In this regard, I find merit in the submissions of

learned Counsel for the 1st to 11th Respondents that the 1st Respondent

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

23

Bank, being a licensed commercial bank, must compete with other private

commercial banks and must have the most competent officers at its senior

positions.

The single vacancy for the post of Deputy Head of Finance was

announced and applications from eligible candidates were called by Staff

Circular No. 7588/2015 3R11. This Circular made reference to Staff

Circular No. 392/2008 3R7, which sets out the applicable Eligibility

Criteria. The Staff Circular 3R11 also informs the candidates that the

selections will be made subject to an interview under item No. 3(1) and

further states that only those who have completed a minimum period of

service and possess the required academic and professional qualifications,

could apply. Thus, the criteria set by the said Committee in that circular is

restricted only to the qualifications , experience and key attributes that are

required for eligibility to be considered for appointment or promotion. The

word illegibility in the said Rule should be noted and given meaning to.

In setting out the minimum requirements to be considered as being

eligible to apply for the post in itself is an indication that it is not the final

act of screening and there would be other requirements that an applicant

might need to satisfy in order to qualify for the promotion. It is therefore

reasonable to expect that the assessment of the suitability of each candidate

for the promotion would be taken into consideration at the end of the

interview process by the Board Nomination Committee, at which stage the

candidate, who is most suited for the post, is selected to be recommended

for promotion.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

24

The selection of the candidates after an interview by a Board

Nomination Committee has been the procedure consistently applied by the

1st Respondent bank, as indicative from the Staff Circular Nos. 392/2008

403/2009 (3R12(b)) (3R7), 7587/2015 (3R12(a)), 7588/2015 (3R11)

and 7663/2016 (3R12). If an applicant is eligible to be applied to the

post, then he is expected to perfect an application following the specimen

provided, which will then be submitted through his Head of Department,

who acts as a reporting officer. The application would thereafter be

forwarded to the senior management along with a Performance Appraisal

of the candidate by the reporting officer. All these documents were

tendered, marked, 3R13 for perusal of Court. The Petitioner has no

issues over the manner of selection, as set out in the Circular, i.e. by way of

an interview.

Since this has been the procedure consistently adopted by the 1st

Respondent Bank in selecting candidates for promotions, it is

understandable that the Petitioners decision not to mount a challenge to

the legality of the mode of selection made by the Board Nomination

Committee through an interview. The Petitioner was subjected to same

and identical procedure in all of her previous unsuccessful attempts to

secure a promotion. Even, in her appeal addressed to the Chairman of the

1st Respondent Bank (P17), after the 12th Respondent was promoted to

the post of Deputy Head of Finance, she did not complain either the

procedure was wrong or the manner in which the interviewing process

conducted was wrong.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

25

One of the contentions presented by the learned Presidents Counsel

in this regard is that the 1st Respondent Bank has failed to issue the

marking scheme that would be adopted by the Board Nomination

Committee in assessing the suitability of her candidacy for the post prior

to the interview. Admittedly no marking scheme was issued by the 1st

Respondent Bank to either of the two candidates prior to their interviews.

In this respect, the Petitioner and the 12th Respondent were similarly

circumstanced.

The desirability of making known the applicable marking scheme to

the prospective candidates, prior to the selection process for recruitment as

well as for promotions, although not insisted on as an imperative

requirement, was already recognised by this Court. The judgments of

Perera and Another v Cyril Ranatunga (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 39, Perera and

Others v Monetary Board of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (supra), Piyasena

and Another v Peoples Bank and Others (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 65, Abeysinghe

and Others v Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau and Others (1996) 2

Sri L.R. 36 and Wijesuriya v National Savings Bank (1997) 1 Sri L.R. 181

are some of the instances, where this requirement was consistently insisted

upon. The underlying reason for the insistence of compliance of this

requirement is, if such a scheme is publicised in advance, it affords an

equal opportunity to all candidates in presenting their individual cases in

the best possible manner, when facing their respective interview panels.

That would ensure a level playing field for all candidates giving them the

confidence that they will be selected through a transparent process.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

26

However, the Petitioners act of placing reliance on the failure to

fulfil that requirement by the 1st Respondent Bank, could not be reconciled

with her complaint before this Court, for the reason that her complaint

against the interview process is founded on a totally different footing.

The Petitioner in her appeal addressed to the Chairman of the 1st

Respondent Bank (P17) complained that she entertains the thought that

she had been earmarked not to be given the promotion . She then states

in paragraph 30 of her petition to this Court that the said interview

process was flawed in as much as there was a failure to set out the manner in

which marks would be allotted at the interview. The Petitioner verily believes that

the interview was a sham interview done with the intent of giving legitimacy to

the promotion of the 12th Respondent. The Petitioner states that if there were some

intelligible criteria the Petitioner would have been entitled to be appointed to the

impugned post. The Petitioner does not possess the mark sheets given at the

interview . Supporting her said allegation that the interview was only a

sham interview done with the intent of giving legitimacy to the promotion of the

12th Respondent, the Petitioner also states in paragraph 29 that the

Management of the 1st Respondent Bank waited for more than five years until the

12th Respondent obtained eligibility to apply for the Grade of Deputy Head of

Chief Finance Officer. The Petitioner, based upon these accusations,

submitted that the process aforesaid demonstrated that the Bank waited till

the 12th Respondent was promoted to Grade of Deputy Chief Finance Officer to fill

the vacancy in dispute. It is further substantiated by cancelling the first two

instances in which applications were called to fill the vacancy in dispute.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

27

Obviously, the Petitioner makes a specific claim that she has been

subject to an act of wilful discrimination committed by the 1st Respondent

Bank, by extending an unwarranted preferential treatment to the 12th

Respondent, in making the impugned selection for promotion. If the

allegation of the Petitioner that the Board Nomination Committee was

partial in their assessment in favour of the 12th Respondent, and that they

acted in collusion with the management, which kept this vacancy for over

five years vacant until the 12th Respondent became eligible to apply, is

accepted, then it is reasonable to infer that, irrespective of the fact that the

marking scheme was issued prior to the interview and the Petitioner was

able to put her case across in the best possible manner, she would not

succeed in securing the promotion anyway, as the Committee was pre-

determined on whom they intend to select. Hence, in this particular

instance, the impact of the failure to make the marking scheme known to

the candidates prior to the selection, made on the final outcome of the

interview is greatly reduced and thereby loses relevance.

In these circumstances, this Court must then proceed to decide the

question whether the Petitioner has established that the interview

conducted by the Board Nomination Committee, acted in a manner

prejudicial to her interests, by arriving at a pre-determined finding made

in favour of the 12th Respondent by treating her differently from the 12th

Respondent.

In order to impress upon this Court that the Board Nomination

Committee discriminated against the Petitioner, she has relied on

following factors:

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

28

a. she was not informed of her total marks at the close of the

interview,

b. mark sheets applicable to the Petitioner lacks the details in

contrast to the marksheet 3R20,

c. her period of long service, although not the only factor for

consideration, should have been a one relevant to her

promotion, but not considered,

d. the mark sheets of the two candidates, although to be

completed during the interview process, were completed

subsequently to justify the appointment of the 12th

Respondent, as the individual members of the interview

panel have given identical marks under different headings,

but were entered into mark sheets by one person

e. allocation of marks by the Board Nomination Committee

was not done in good faith.

In order to properly appreciate the Petitioners contention on this

issue, it is desirable that the different criteria, that were applied by the

Board Nomination Committee, during the interview and in awarding

marks to the two contestants are referred to at this stage. The different

criteria on which the Board Nomination Committee has decided to

evaluate the two candidates at the interview are as follows:

a. Persuasive communication and presentation skills,

b. Leadership in delivering of a strategic vision,

c. Analytical ability with macro picture awareness,

d. Business orientation,

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

29

e. Promoting team work and leadership capabilities.

Contesting the description of these different criteria, the Petitioner,

in her counter affidavit, stated that the version presented by the

Respondents is a improbable and not credible one for it is clear that the

different heading under which marks were given have been prepared ad

hoc. Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner also brought it to the

attention of Court that the mark sheets on which the members of the Board

Nomination Committee entered marks under each of these criteria bore

identical handwriting. He therefore requests the Court to reject the

explanation of the 3rd Respondent, that he wrote them down on the

instructions of each Committee member, as a highly untenable and

unlikely scenario, and further submitted that it also demonstrates the

panel did not give any marking contemporaneously. Learned Presidents

Counsel further submitted that the identical marks given by each member

under each criterion, seriously undermines the credibility of the interview.

He referred to the fact that the decision to award a zero mark for the

Petitioner over the criterion of business orientation of the Bank is unfair,

in view of her immense contribution to uphold the business orientation of the

bank.

It is advisable for this Court, before making an attempt to consider

this particular aspect of the Petitioners case, to consider the scope within

which the Board Nomination Committee has acted, in setting up the said

criteria.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

30

The 3rd Respondent, in paragraph 17 of her affidavit stated in

relation to the post of Deputy Head of Finance, that the said position is

performance oriented and necessitates the incumbent to possess good presentation

and communications skills, dynamism and a sociable personality especially as she

has to represent the 1st Respondent Bank at forums such as Central Bank of Sri

Lanka and other third party local and international institutions. He further

avers that [I]n fact criteria such as length of service and or seniority are not

mandatory requirements specified in the eligibility criteria in the scheme of

promotion for the post of Deputy Head of Finance.

The Petitioner, in seeking to counter the 3rd Respondents said

assertion, merely states in her counter affidavit that, by placing reliance on

the contents of the said averment, the 1st Respondent Bank is deliberately

making an attempt to convince this Court of the fact that she was not

qualified to hold the relevant post.

Given the importance of the post of Deputy Head of Finance, in the

organisational structure of the 1st Respondent Bank, I am inclined to accept

what the 3rd Respondent has said in his affidavit, in terms of the mode of

assessments carried out at the interview, as the Board Nomination

Committee was, by then, fully possessed itself of the educational,

professional and other qualifications of the two applicants, along with

their Performance Appraisals, that were endorsed by reporting officers

who inserted their observations. It also had the benefit of the Performance

Evaluations made by another committee 3R14, made in respect of the

two candidates, among several other candidates. In this evaluation the

Petitioner received a C ranking by coming within the band of 17 -23

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

31

marks, whereas the 12th Respondent received a B ranking, by securing

marks within the band of 24 29.

It is therefore reasonable to expect that the Board Nomination

Committee is only left with the evaluation of the candidates by testing

their suitability to the requirements of the post to which the promotion is

sought and that too at the interview, founded upon an intelligible

differentia, between the two competitors. Amerasinghe J, in Ragunathan v

Jayawardene, Secretary ,Ministry of Transport and Highways and

Another ( 1994) 2 Sri L.R. 255, observed that (at p. 256) [A]rticle 12 of the

Constitution does not preclude the imposition of qualifying examinations, selective

tests and other criteria for selecting or promoting public officers to assure

efficiency. More importantly, his Lordship further observed that [T]he

distinction between those qualified for promotion and those who were not was

therefore founded upon an intelligible differentia. Similarly, in Ramuppillai v

Festus Perera, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils

and Home Affairs and Others (supra), it was held that (at p. 19), the

equality of opportunity takes within its fold all stages of service from initial

appointment to its termination including promotion, but that it does not prohibit

the prescription of reasonable rules for selection and promotion applicable to all

members of a classified group. Hence, the Petitioner and the 12th

Respondent, after being appointed to the Grade of Deputy Finance Officer,

could then be taken in as members of a classified group who should have

been treated as equals when facing the interview.

The marks that were awarded at the interview by the Board

Nomination Committee to the two contestants are tabulated below:

The Petitioner now seeks to challenge the credibility of the claim

made by the 3rd Respondent of utilisation of different criteria at the

interview on the basis that it has been adopted on an ad hoc basis and the

management did so only after this Court granted leave to proceed in the

instant application. Despite challenging the fact that an interview was

conducted on a set of criteria determined by the Board Nomination

Committee, the Petitioner, in her petition itself complaints that she was not

informed of her total marks, at the close of the interview, indicating that

the said Committee, in fact has awarded marks to the two contestants,

probably based on those criteria. In consideration of the complaint that the

Petitioner received only zero marks for business orientation, it must be

noted that the total marks that could have been awarded under that

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

33

particular criterion is limited to just one mark. In that scenario, if the

Petitioner could not perform to the expected level, then there is no other

option left for the Board Nomination Committee other than to award only

zero marks, for if she is given one mark, that would indicate that she did

possess the required skill to the satisfaction of the Committee. Mark

Fernando J in Piyasena and Another v The Peoples Bank and Others

(1994) 2 Sri L.R. 65 made the following observation (at p. 71) in this

regard:

[I] must not be understood as suggesting that a strict allocation of

marks for each such factor was necessary; especially at this level of

management that would unduly constrict a fruitful selection

process. For example, one or two extraordinarily innovative

strategies for development might win one candidate full marks for

interview performance, just as a serious deficiency in management

capabilities may lead to the conclusion that any further promotion of

another candidate would be detrimental to the institution. I am also

not of the view that a proper selection process must necessarily

incorporate a marking scheme; but if selection is to be on the basis of

marks, then the scheme must be clear, fair, and uniform.

The other complaint is the identical handwriting that appears in the

mark sheets, and the probability of the 3rd Respondents claim of entering

the marks by himself. Her complaint is that the mark sheets of the two

candidates, which should have been completed during the interview

process, were completed subsequently in order to justify the appointment

of the 12th Respondent, as the individual members of the interview panel

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

34

have given identical marks under different headings, but those marks were

entered into respective mark sheets by a third person.

This aspect was first brought to the notice of Court by the 3rd

Respondent in his affidavit. He has offered an explanation. According to

the 3rd Respondent, he is tasked by the Committee to enter marks, as

indicated by each of the members at the end of the interview, and that too

after having arrived at consensus among them. This explains the identical

marking given by all three members under a given criterion. As to the

probabilities of the 3rd Respondent being tasked to enter the marks, he

tendered similar entries that were made in respect of other interviews,

marked as 3R20 indicating that it was his own handwriting that appears

in them as well. The Petitioner brought up this issue only in her counter

affidavit and that too after the 3rd Respondent, in his affidavit has

sufficiently explained this factor.

The remaining complaint that should be examined in relation to the

allegation of the Petitioner is made on account of her long period of service

was not considered by the Board Nomination Committee. It has already

been referred earlier on in this judgment that the post of Deputy Head of

Finance is a performance oriented senior position in the management of

the 1st Respondent Bank and therefore, as the Petitioner herself concedes

that her long service, although not the only factor for consideration, is only

a one relevant factor, among many others.

The eligibility criteria, as set out paragraph 6 in the said circular, for

the said post are as follows:

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

35

a. A good record of service

AND

b. Deputy Chief Finance Officer with associate membership of

ICA/ACCA/CIMA

OR

c. Final examination of ICA/ACCA/CIMA with 2 years

experience in the grade of Deputy Chief Finance Officer

OR

d. Intermediate/Part II level qualifications of ICA/ACCA/

CIMA with a minimum of 3 years experience in the grade of

Deputy Chief Finance Officer and should have 18 years

experience in the bank of which 8 years in the Finance

Division.

The Petitioner, in her application opted to place her eligibility under

Para 6 (a) and (b) whereas the 12th Respondent placed her eligibility

under Para 6 (b) only. The Petitioner, although had 18 years of service by

then, could not apply under Paragraph 6(d), as she did not have the other

eligibility requirement of 8 years in the Finance Division. With the

insertion of this paragraph in setting out different eligibility criteria, the 1st

Respondent Bank, offered due recognition for seniority but insisted that

the applicant should have a significant part of his seniority in its Finance

Division. Hence, the Petitioner cannot claim that her long service should

have been the primary factor at the interview, when the Board Nomination

Committee devised its own criteria to assess the candidates, based on the

requirements of the 1st Respondent Bank. None of the candidates opted to

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

36

rely on their respective service periods as a basis upon which they claim

eligibility to apply for the post.

Having set up the different criteria on which the Committee

intended to select the candidate to be recommended for promotion, it has

proceeded to conduct the interviews on two consecutive days. It is not

clear whether the two candidates were interviewed by the Board

Nomination Committee on both these days or whether it interviewed each

candidate on different days. Whatever the manner the two candidates

were interviewed on, it is clear that the Committee has devoted sufficient

time for each of the candidate to impress upon it of their suitability for the

post in the best possible manner. The Petitioner opted not contest that

position.

At the end of the interview process, what the Committee did was to

allocate marks to each of the two candidates, in respect of each criterion.

After adding up the individual total scored by each of the candidates, the

Board Nomination Committee made the recommendation that the 12th

Respondent be promoted to the post of Deputy Head of Finance as she has

scored the highest. When the Board Nomination Committee made the

selection on the basis of marks each candidate was given on different

criteria, and after selecting the 12th Respondent to be nominated to the post

on the basis of she is the highest scorer, it had applied an intelligible

differentia, based on the performance of each of them in the interview. The

Petitioner and the 12th Respondent, who upon being roped into a group of

Deputy Chief Finance Officers, are candidates who should have been

treated as equals, but prior to the interview. However, after the interview

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

37

was concluded, and with the assessment made by the Board Nomination

Committee over the marks that should be given to each of them on

multiple criteria on which that interview was conducted, the highest scorer

then by virtue of that fact becomes an unequal to the other candidate. The

Petitioner who scored less and therefore could not be treated as an equal to

her former colleague.

What the equality before law and equal protection of law, assured

on the Petitioner by Article 12(1), connotes was dealt by Sharvananda CJ in

the judgment of Perera v University Grants Commission F.R.D.(1)103 (at

p. 114). His Lordship stated that discrimination to be violative of Article

12 must be discrimination between equals; that no infringement of Article 12 is

involved where unequals are treated differently; that the intelligible differentia

required to support a permissible classification must distinguish persons or things

that are grouped together from others left out of the group, and must have a

reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved; that there must be some

rational nexus between the basis of such classification and the object intended to be

achieved by such classification.

The two tests, in determining what is a permissible classification,

namely that it must have a reasonable relation to the object sought to be

achieved; that there must be some rational nexus between the basis of such

classification and the object intended to be achieved by such classification, as

applied by Sharvananda CJ, was referred to and applied by Ranasinghe CJ in

Ramuppillai v Festus Perera, Minister of Public Administration,

Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and Others (supra, at p. 20).

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

38

The 3rd Respondent in the Statement of Objections has annexed a

document, which sets out the nature of the responsibilities that the post of

Deputy Head of Finance carries. The documents titled Job Description

Deputy Head of Finance, tendered as 3R6 states under the title

summary of the job, that he is responsible for providing of accurate and

timely management of information on Banks performance monthly, quarterly and

annually, responsible for providing information requested by other internal

departments and external parties such a Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Government

Ministries, Fitch Ratings etc. It includes the responsibility for handling annual

report work and implementation of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (including

32&39, SLFRS 7) in the Bank. Responsible for the Sustainability Reporting and

GRI (Global Reporting Initiatives) in the Bank.

Perusal of the said job description seemed to suggest that the post of

Deputy Head of Finance is primarily responsible for timely dissemination

of accurate information of the Banks performance to multiple local and

foreign agencies all year round. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in

order to fulfil that responsibility effectively, the candidate who aspires to

take on that post, must have an overall familiarity of the workings of

almost all the Departments of the Bank, and particularly an in-depth

knowledge of its Finance Department. This factor is highlighted when one

considers the requirement that, in addition to acting as the primary

interface between the Bank and other related entities and ensuring

maintenance of banking standards, the Deputy Head of Finance is also

responsible to highlight special improvements and negative trends to the

management in order to take necessary actions.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

39

The key competencies/skills that are listed out therein includes a

good understanding of the accounting standards and previous working experience

in a bank/financial organisation/finance department is a must to handle this job.

In her counter affidavit, the Petitioner, after highlighting that the

document 3R6 was created subsequent to her filing of the instant

petition before this Court and even though having portrayed it as an

attempt by the bank to convince this Court that she is not qualified to the

post, states that she had already presented ample evidence to substantiate

my presentation and communications skills and dynamism.

The fact that the contents of the document 3R6 was formulated on

01.01.2016, and subsequent to the Petitioner coming before this Court is

undisputed. However, as learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted,

the fact remains that the Petitioner too, by highlighting her own

credentials that aligns with the job description as described therein and

claims that she too has the required skills, thereby tacitly accepted the

contents of that document as reflecting the correct job description of a

Deputy Head of Finance.

It is a fact that the Petitioner is an accomplished communicator as

she acted as a resource person in multiple training programs conducted by

the 1st Respondent Bank passing valuable knowledge to her junior

colleagues. She has won the title of Competent Communicator from the

Toastmasters International Communication Program in 2014, in addition

winning many other awards. But what is relevant here is the

communication skills, in terms of the responsibilities that are associated

with the post of Deputy Head of Finance, which in turn necessitates a

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

40

thorough understanding of the workings of the Finance Department of the

1st Respondent Bank. The job description too highlights this necessity by

emphasising on the importance of previous working experience in a

bank/financial organisation/finance department is a must to handle this job. The

Petitioner has long experience in Internal Audit and Risk Management.

She has never served in the Finance Department of the 1st Respondent

Bank, whereas the 12th Respondent, has work experience in that

Department, for a period of more than 11 years.

When viewed in this backdrop of factors, it is not surprising that the

12th Respondent has performed better than the Petitioner in almost all the

different criteria, which meant to test the suitability of the two candidates

for the vacancy of the post of Deputy Head of Finance, as she has a distinct

edge over her rival in the field of finance. It is this factor that led to the

ultimate result, which secured the promotion to the 12th Respondent, now

challenged under these proceedings.

I have already referred to the different criteria on which the Board

Nomination Committee has adopted to evaluate the two candidates

during the interview in this judgment. It is of relevance to reproduce them

once more here at this stage to highlight a slightly different aspect. This

became necessary as the intelligible differentia, on which the 12th

Respondent was recommended to be promoted, needed to be tested for

reasonableness of that classification. The criteria adopted by the Board

Nomination includes the following:

a. Persuasive communication and presentation skills,

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

41

b. Leadership in delivering of a strategic vision,

c. Analytical ability with macro picture awareness,

d. Business orientation,

e. Promoting team work and leadership capabilities.

It is my considered view that these criteria, adopted by the

Committee to select the most suitable candidate to be recommended for

promotion, when viewed against the job description of the post of Deputy

Head of Finance, satisfies the two tests applied by this Court in Perera v

University Grants Commission (supra) and Ramuppillai v Festus Perera,

Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs

and Others (supra).

Learned Counsel for the 1st to 5th ,10th and 11th as well as the 12th

Respondents contended that the selection was made strictly on the basis of

merit as the nature of the responsibilities of the post, and the criteria set up

by the Committee to be in line with those requisites, warranted a

competent person to be selected as the Deputy Head of Finance and the

12th Respondent found to be the most suitable of the two candidates for the

said post.

The examination of the criteria set up by the Board Nomination

Committee, also reflects that it intended to screen the two contestants on

their relative merits rather than totally on their seniority in the 1st

Respondent Bank. The merit component seems to have weigh more in the

selection process, as the 3rd Respondent states that the candidates were to

be assessed on their performance. In this context it is relevant to refer to an

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

42

observation made by Mark Fernando J in Perera and Another v Cyril

Ranatunga, Secretary Defence and Others 93/1/39, (at p. 43) merit

must be considered in relation to the individual officer, as well as requirements of

the post to which he seeks promotion. It would also be legitimate to consider the

suitability of the officer for the post, having regard to the aptitudes and skill

required for the efficient discharge of the functions of that post, and the service to

be rendered.

His Lordship further observed that (at p. 46) the weightage given

to seniority vis--vis merit can vary. Less weight may legitimately be given where

the post involves onerous responsibilities and requires special skills and aptitudes

and correspondingly, greater weightage given to positive merit and the

candidates skills and aptitudes. In this instance of course, there cannot be a

dispute that the post of Deputy Head of Finance fits perfectly into the

description that the post involves onerous responsibilities and therefore to

select a candidate with special skills and aptitudes by giving greater

weightage to positive merit and the candidates skills and aptitudes. This

reasoning of Fernando J in Perera and Another v Cyril Ranatunga,

Secretary Defence and Others (supra)was consistently adopted in

Abeysinghe and Others v Central engineering Consultancy Bureau and

Others (1994) 1 Sri L.R. 152 and in Ariyasinghe v State Timber Corporation

and Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 48.In Dharmaratne and Another v Sri Lanka

Export Development Board and Others (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 324, Fernando J

thought it fit to add another factor to the said pronouncement by stating

that (at p. 337) [T]he weightage to be given, to seniority and other criteria, was a

matter within the discretion of the interview board.

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

43

His Lordship thereupon reiterated once more (also at p. 337) that

[T]he weightage for seniority must depend on the nature of the post: the greater

its responsibilities, more the justification for giving greater weightage for factors

relevant to merit and ability, and performance.

Thus, in view of the considerations I have referred to in the

preceding paragraphs, the impugned selection of the 12th Respondent is

qualified to be taken in as an instance where equality of employment

opportunity admits discrimination with reason and prohibits discrimination

without a reason as observed by Ranasinghe CJ in Ramuppillai v Festus

Perera, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home

Affairs and Others (supra, at p.22). In these circumstances, despite the fact

that prior to the interview, both the Petitioner as well as the 12th

Respondent could be grouped together as equals, they could not be treated

as equals any longer with the 12th Respondent scoring higher marks and,

in the circumstances, as Amerasinghe J observed in Ragunathan v

Jayawardene, Secretary ,Ministry of Transport and Highways and

Another (supra, at p. 256) to treat the petitioner and 3rd respondent as

equally entitled to promotion would be improper, for it would result in treating

unequals equally.

Having dealt with the issues of whether the criteria on which the

candidates were assessed and the intelligible differentia on which the 12th

Respondent was recommended to be promoted, I now turn to the

remaining part of the complaint of the Petitioner that she was wilfully

discriminated by the 1st Respondent Bank, by affording preferential

treatment to the 12th Respondent. This was the complaint she made to the

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

44

Chairman of the 1st Respondent Bank in her appeal (P17). She stated,

[I] wonder if I had been earmarked not to be given the promotion (for reasons I do

not know) when all the facts mentioned above are taken together, after the 12th

Respondent was selected to the post.

The complaint of being discriminated by denying her a due

promotion was more formally made by the Petitioner in her petition

addressed to this Court as the primary ground of complaint. The Petitioner

states that she was systematically deprived of her promotion over several

years and made references to several instances during which the 1st

Respondent Bank made announcements to fill the vacancy, long before the

impugned interview was held. In relation to the last of the interviews,

which is impugned in these proceedings, the Petitioner stated that she

verily believes that the interview was a sham interview done with the intent of

giving legitimacy to the promotion of the 12th Respondent, an averment the 3rd

Respondent specifically denied by stating that the candidates are judged

by testing their suitability to the requirements of the post to which the promotion

is sought.

Thus, the manner in which the interview was conducted becomes

the very foundation on which the Petitioners claim of discrimination is

built on.

Strangely, the Petitioner did not describe the manner in which the

interviews were held by the Board Nomination Committee. It is in the

Statement of Objections that the 3rd Respondent has set out the different

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

45

criteria, which were adopted by the Board Nomination Committee to

award marks to the candidates at the interview and the manner in which

the two interviews were held. The 3rd Respondent too has participated in

these interviews, in his capacity as the Secretary to the Borad of Directors,

and therefore provided direct evidence as to the manner in which the

interviews were conducted. The Petitioner tendered a counter affidavit by

which she denied most of these averments and presented certain set of

circumstances over some selected instances, by which she made an attempt

to address to the issues that were taken up by the 3rd Respondent in the

Statement of Objections.

The Petitioner, however, is conspicuously silent on what exactly

happened during the interview and the manner in which the Board

Nomination Committee has treated her and considered her suitability to

the post. Clearly there is no allegation made by the Petitioner that the

Board Nomination Committee has acted in a hostile manner, treated her

shabbily or was indifferent and thereby prevented her from presenting her

suitability for the post in an effective manner before the Committee.

Neither she states that it acted mala fide, during that process. This is an

important factor, particularly in view of the Petitioners allegation that the

1st Respondent has kept the vacancy for five consecutive years without

filling it by promoting her, all the while patiently waiting until the 12th

Respondent became eligible to apply for that vacancy and the Committee

too participated in that conspiracy by in acting in collusion with the 1st

Respondent Bank, in selecting the 12th Respondent overlooking her. If the

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

46

Committee was determined to fail the Petitioner from the selection process

by acting on a pre-agreed terms with the management, all it needs to do

was to make it difficult for the Petitioner to put across her case effectively.

Despite describing the interview as a sham interview, conducted

with the intent of giving legitimacy to the promotion of the 12th Respondent,

the Petitioner in her petition, did not accuse any individual member or the

Board Nomination Committee of having taken part in a conspiracy with

the 1st Respondent Bank by agreeing to somehow select the 12th

Respondent to the post of Deputy Head of Finance, and in the process to

totally disregarding the Petitioners educational, professional

qualifications and of her performance during the interview in order to

discriminate her.

Similarly, there is no specific factual allegations made by the

Petitioner against the Committee that the criteria that has been adopted at

the interview to award marks to the two candidates, except to state that it

was adopted on an ad hoc basis after she complained to this Court. There is

no explanation in the counter affidavit as to why the Petitioner failed to

disclose any factual assertions in relation to the manner in which the

Committee has conducted the interview. Her complaint against the

Committee is confined to her being awarded with only a zero mark under

the criterion for Business Orientation of the Bank. These individual

complaints against some aspects of the interview, which has no bearing on

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

47

the allegation of discrimination, and were already dealt with and need not

be reconsidered once more at this stage. The complaint that the interview

is a sham, is also tied to the Petitioners allegation of multiple deprivations

of opportunity for a promotion, as an essential component. That part offers

no support to the Petitioners allegation of denial of her right to equality by

discrimination.

This Court, in the judgment of Elmore Perera v Major Montague

Jayawickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Plantation

Industries and Others (1985) 1 Sri L.R. 285, held that (at p. 323) relief

cannot be granted in proceedings under Article 126 in the absence of proof of

hostile discrimination evidencing unequal treatment. The judgment of

Samarasinghe v The Bank of Ceylon Ltd.,(1979) 1 Sri L.R. 221, also

considered the question of the required degree of proof to which a

petitioner must satisfy this Court, after making an allegation of

discrimination. The Court held (at p.229) that the petitioner has not

displaced the burden which is upon him to set out facts required to support the

plea of discrimination. He has not placed any cogent and convincing evidence to

establish discrimination. In this instance too I hold that the Petitioner has

failed to discharge that burden to the required level of proof.

In view of the reasons set out herein before, I am of the view that the

Petitioner has failed to establish that the 1st to 11th Respondents have

infringed her fundamental right to equality by discrimination, in selecting

the 12th Respondent to fill the vacancy for the post of Deputy Head of

S.C. FR Application No. 419/2015

48

Finance in the 1st Respondent Bank, on a balance of probability with cogent

and convincing evidence.

Accordingly, the petition of the Petitioner stands dismissed.

I make no order on costs.
