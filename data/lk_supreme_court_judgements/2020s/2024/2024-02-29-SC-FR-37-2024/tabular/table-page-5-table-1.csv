"When  this  application  was  supported  in  court,  the  Attorney  General  who  appeared  for  the",""
"respondents raised the following preliminary objections;",""
"(i)","The  matters  urged  in  the  petition  do  not  fall  within  the  ambit  of  ‘executive  and"
"","administrative action’ referred to in Article 126 of the Constitution. In this regard, he"
"","drew the attention of court to averments in the petition and the prayer (b) to the petition."
"","Hence, as the allegations levelled in the petition do not fall within the ‘executive and"
"","administrative action’, the instant application should be dismissed in limine. In support"
"","of his contention, he submitted that the powers of the legislature are set out in Chapter"
"","11 of the Constitution and the allegation levelled in the petition falls outside the scope"
"","of ‘executive and administrative’ action."
"(ii)","Further, he drew the attention of court to the averments in the affidavit filed along with"
"","the petition and submitted that the matters referred to in the said averments had taken"
"","place in the chamber of Parliament. Therefore, such matters fall within Parliamentary"
"","privileges and thus, the courts have no jurisdiction to look into the matters referred to"
"","in the petition."
"(iii)","Moreover, the 1st respondent has certified the ‘Online Safety Bill’ under Article 79 of"
"","the Constitution. Hence, the court cannot consider the legality of the Act in view of"
"","Article  80(3)  of  the  Constitution.  In  this  regard,  he  cited  the  judgment  delivered  in"
"","Gamage v Perera (2006) 3 SLR 354 at 359."
"(iv)","Matters averred in the petition refers to the legislative process and therefore, Article"
"","124  of  the  Constitution  has  ousted 
the  jurisdiction  of  courts 
in  considering 
the"
"","procedure that the ‘Online Safety Bill’ was enacted into law."
"(v)","In terms of section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act the courts have no"
"","jurisdiction to consider the allegations stated in the petition as the said section has taken"
"","away the jurisdiction of courts with regard to matters relating to parliamentary affairs."
