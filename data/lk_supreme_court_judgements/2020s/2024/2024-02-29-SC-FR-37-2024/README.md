Respondents

Argued on : 20th February, 2024

Decided on : 29th February, 2024

Petition

The petitioner filed the instant application, alleging that there was non-compliance with the

determination made by the Supreme Court in legislating the Online Safety Bill. Further, in the

prayer to the petition, the petitioner prayed, inter alia;

(b) Issue an interim order suspending the operation of the purported document

published as Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 (marked P9(a)-(c)), and / or

such other appropriate order;

(c) Declare that the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14 of the

Constitution to the Petitioner and the citizens of Sri Lanka, have been infringed

by the purported certification by the 1st Respondent of the 'Online Safety Act

No. 9 of 2024" P9(a)-(e)), and that such conduct entails further imminent

infringement of such rights, and amounts to a continuing violation of the said

fundamental rights, and/or such other appropriate order;

(d) Declare that the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14 of the

Constitution to the Petitioner and the citizens of Sri Lanka, have been infringed

by the 2nd Respondent, by failing to advise the 1st Respondent and/or Parliament

that the purported Committee Stage Amendments did not make the Online

Safety Bill compliant with the Determination of Your Lordships' Court and/or

that the said Bill would still require a 2/3 Special Majority vote in order to be

enacted into law;

(e) Declare that the purported certification of the 1st Respondent of the purported

'Online Safety Act (P9(a)-(c)), is a nullity in law, and of no force and/or effect

in law, and/ or such other appropriate order;

3

(f) Declare that the purported document published as "Online Safety Act No. 9 of

2024" (P9(a)-(c)) is ultra vires the Constitution and of no force and / or effect

in law, and/or such other appropriate order;

The petitioner stated that on the 18th of September, 2023 a Bill titled Online Safety Bill was

published in the Gazette. Further, since the provisions in the said Bill were inconsistent with the

Constitution, the jurisdiction of this court was invoked in terms of Article 120 read with Article

121 of the Constitution by the petitioner and several others to determine whether any of the Clauses

in the said Bill were inconsistent with the Constitution.

The petitioner stated that when the Bill was taken up for hearing in court on the 18th of October

2023, the learned Additional Solicitor General, who appeared in court on notice issued by court,

proposed several amendments to the Bill and informed court that the said amendments would be

moved at the Committee Stage in Parliament. After the hearing in court, the determination of the

court was forwarded to the 1st respondent and the President of the Republic. Thereafter, the 1st

respondent read out the determination in Parliament on the 7th of November, 2023.

Further, this court determined that several Clauses of the Bill were inconsistent with the

Constitution, and thus, such Clauses should be passed in Parliament by a Special Majority.

However, the court further determined that if the proposed amendments referred to in the

determination were incorporated into the Bill, then the inconsistencies in the Bill would cease, and

the Bill could be passed with a simple majority vote of Members of Parliament.

Moreover, on the 23rd of January 2024, the debate relating to the Online Safety Bill commenced

in Parliament. Furthermore, during the Committee Stage in Parliament, several Members of

Parliament, including the petitioner, brought to the notice of the 1st respondent that there were

several inconsistencies between the determination and the Committee Stage amendments proposed

in Parliament. Further, the petitioner identified the said discrepancies and offered to list them out

to Parliament or give them to the relevant Minister.

Thereafter, during the course of the Parliamentary proceedings, the petitioner was asked to speak

to the Additional Solicitor General, who was present in the Public Officers Box and was

accompanied by the Assistant Secretary General of Parliament. There, the petitioner raised the

issue of non-compliance with the determination made by this court but was informed that all of

the amendments required by the Supreme Court would be incorporated into the Act. However, at

the third reading, despite requests for a division, the 1st respondent proceeded to declare that the

4

Bill was passed without taking a vote thereon. The petitioner further stated that the Bill was not

passed by a special majority vote in Parliament, either at the second reading or at the third reading.

The petitioner further stated that, in the absence of complying with the amendments suggested in

the determination of the Supreme Court, the Bill was required to be passed by a special majority

in Parliament. Hence, the speaker shall certify the Bill only if it has been passed by a special

majority in Parliament.

The petitioner stated that in terms of Gazette Extraordinary No. 2368/25 dated 26th of January

2024, published by the President in terms of Article 70 of the Constitution, Parliament was

prorogued with effect from midnight on the 26th of January, 2024, and was to commence its next

session on the 7th of February, 2024. However, the 1st respondent purportedly certified the Online

Safety Bill on the 1st of February, 2024.

Thus, the purported certification is invalid in law as the purported certification took place while

Parliament remained prorogued. Hence, the Online Safety Bill has not become law. Further, the

Online Safety Bill cannot be considered as passed into law in terms of the Constitution,

particularly in view of Article 123 read with Articles 79 and 80.

The petitioner stated that by purporting to endorse the certificate on the Online Safety Bill under

Article 79 of the Constitution, the 1st respondent has acted in violation of the Constitution and

violated the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner and the citizens of Sri Lanka. In the

circumstances, the petitioner stated that his Fundamental Rights and the Fundamental Rights of

the citizens of Sri Lanka guaranteed under Article 12(1) have been violated by the actions of the

1st respondent.

Further, the purported act of the 1st respondent in endorsing the certificate of the said Bill amounts

to executive and/or administrative action within the meaning of Article 17 read with Article 126

of the Constitution. In any event, the purported actions of the 1st respondent are ultra vires the

Constitution and a nullity in law. Hence, the purported actions of the 1st respondent is not protected

by any form of privilege or immunity.

5

Preliminary Objections raised by the respondents

When this application was supported in court, the Attorney General who appeared for the

respondents raised the following preliminary objections;

(i) The matters urged in the petition do not fall within the ambit of executive and

administrative action referred to in Article 126 of the Constitution. In this regard, he

drew the attention of court to averments in the petition and the prayer (b) to the petition.

Hence, as the allegations levelled in the petition do not fall within the executive and

administrative action, the instant application should be dismissed in limine. In support

of his contention, he submitted that the powers of the legislature are set out in Chapter

11 of the Constitution and the allegation levelled in the petition falls outside the scope

of executive and administrative action.

(ii) Further, he drew the attention of court to the averments in the affidavit filed along with

the petition and submitted that the matters referred to in the said averments had taken

place in the chamber of Parliament. Therefore, such matters fall within Parliamentary

privileges and thus, the courts have no jurisdiction to look into the matters referred to

in the petition.

(iii) Moreover, the 1st respondent has certified the Online Safety Bill under Article 79 of

the Constitution. Hence, the court cannot consider the legality of the Act in view of

Article 80(3) of the Constitution. In this regard, he cited the judgment delivered in

Gamage v Perera (2006) 3 SLR 354 at 359.

(iv) Matters averred in the petition refers to the legislative process and therefore, Article

124 of the Constitution has ousted the jurisdiction of courts in considering the

procedure that the Online Safety Bill was enacted into law.

(v) In terms of section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act the courts have no

jurisdiction to consider the allegations stated in the petition as the said section has taken

away the jurisdiction of courts with regard to matters relating to parliamentary affairs.

Do the events referred to in the petition constitute an executive or administrative action

referred to in Article 126 of the Constitution?

The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the 1st respondent purportedly issued the

certificate on the Online Safety Bill in terms of Article 79 of the Constitution. Thus, the 1st

6

respondent has acted in violation of and outside the provisions of the Constitution and violated the

Fundamental Rights of the petitioner and the citizens of Sri Lanka. In this regard, it was submitted

that, as the 1st respondent has acted outside the powers conferred on him by the Constitution, his

actions do not fall within the business of Parliament. Hence, the instant application can be

maintained under Article 126 of the Constitution.

However, the Attorney General submitted that the matters referred to in the petition do not fall

within Article 126 of the Constitution, and such matters refer to the legislative process. Thus, it

needs to be considered whether the events referred to in the petition comes within the purview of

the legislative process or amounts to an executive or administrative action referred to in Article

126 of the Constitution.

Legislative Process

The Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament provide for the presentation of two types

of Bills in Parliament. Namely, Private Members Bills and Government Bills. (Only Government

Bills are discussed in this Order). A Government Bill is initiated by the line Ministry, and the

Minister in charge of the subject will present a Cabinet Memorandum to the Cabinet of Ministers

setting out the policy and the justification to enact the legislation and seeking the approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers to draft the Bill. If the Cabinet of Ministers approves it, the line ministry will

forward the said Cabinet Memorandum and the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to the Legal

Draftsmans Department to draft legislation.

After the Legal Draftsman prepares a draft Bill it will be sent to the Attorney General to examine

the constitutionality of the Bill in terms of Article 77 of the Constitution. If the draft Bill is in

conformity with the Constitution, a certificate is issued by the Attorney General in terms of Article

77(1) of the Constitution stating that the Bill is in conformity with the Constitution. Thereafter,

the draft Bill will be forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers by the Minister in charge of the subject,

along with the certificate issued by the Attorney General, seeking the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers to publish the Bill in the Government Gazette and to table it in Parliament. After the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is obtained, the Bill is tabled in Parliament and published in

the Government Gazette. Once the Bill is read in Parliament, it will be deemed to have been read

for the first time.

7

Once the Bill is placed in the Order Paper of Parliament, any citizen may challenge the

constitutionality of a Bill in terms of Article 120 read with Article 121 of the Constitution, by filing

a petition in the Supreme Court within fourteen days. If a Bill is challenged, the Supreme Court

will determine, in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution, whether the Clauses in the Bill are

inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

Once the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is invoked, no proceedings shall take

place in Parliament in relation to such Bill until the determination of the Supreme Court has been

made or until the expiration of three weeks from the date of filing such petition. Once the

determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill is delivered to the President and the

Speaker, the Speaker shall read out the determination in Parliament. Thereafter, the second reading

of the Bill will commence in Parliament. On the Second Reading of a Bill, a debate will take place

in Parliament covering the general merits and principles of the Bill.

When a Bill has been read for the second time, upon a motion made by a Minister of the Cabinet

of Ministers or a Deputy Minister, the Bill shall be referred to the Committee of the Whole

Parliament or may be referred to a Select Committee or a Legislative Standing Committee or an

appropriate Sectoral Oversight Committee for its views. Where the Bill has been referred to a

Committee other than a Committee of the whole Parliament, no further proceedings should be

taken until that Committee has reported to Parliament.

Thereafter, the third reading of the Bill takes place when a motion is made that the Bill be read for

the third time and passed by a vote in Parliament. If a Sectoral Oversight Committee or the

Legislative Standing Committee or a Select Committee has suggested amendments to the Bill, it

will be read for the third time and passed after Parliament has considered the amendments proposed

by the Committee.

After the Bill is passed by Parliament it will become law once the Speaker endorses the certificate

specified in Article 79 of the Constitution.

Further, Article 80(1) of the Constitution states;

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, a Bill passed by

Parliament shall become law when the certificate of the Speaker is endorsed

thereon.

8

Accordingly, the legislative process ends when the Speaker endorses the certificate. Hence,

endorsing the certificate is not executive or administrative action.

Applicability of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act

The Attorney General further submitted that the events referred to in the petition were events that

took place within the course of parliamentary proceedings. Thus, the aforementioned events fall

within the ambit of section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, and therefore, the

courts have no jurisdiction to impeach or question the said events.

Section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act states;

There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceedings in Parliament and such

freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or

questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.

[emphasis added]

As stated above, the legislative process commences with the line Ministry forwarding a

Memorandum to the Cabinet, seeking approval from the Cabinet to enact legislation on the matter

referred to in the Memorandum. After the aforementioned procedure is completed, the Bill will be

tabled in Parliament. Up to that stage of the Bill, all the necessary steps to enact legislation will

take place outside Parliament.

Tabling of the Bill in Parliament is part of the business or proceedings of Parliament. However,

Articles 120 to 124 of the Constitution have conferred power on the Supreme Court to consider

the constitutionality of the Bill if the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is invoked in terms of

Article 120 read with Article 121 of the Constitution, notwithstanding the fact that the Bill is tabled

in Parliament. Articles 120, 121, 122, 123 and 124 of the Constitution are an exception to the

separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.

Further, once a determination is made by the Supreme Court under Articles 122, it will be

communicated to the President and the Speaker in terms of Article 121(3) of the Constitution.

Thereafter, the determination of the Supreme Court will be announced in Parliament by the

Speaker. From that point onwards, the Parliament will take steps to pass the Bill in terms of the

9

Constitution and Standing Orders of Parliament until the Bill becomes law. Further, all such steps

would be taken according to the legislative process of Parliament.

A careful consideration of the averments in the petition demonstrates that the events referred to in

the petition fall under the legislative process of Parliament.

Further, Article 124 of the Constitution states;

Save as otherwise provided in Articles 120, 121 and 122, no court or tribunal

created and established for the administration of justice, or other institution,

person or body of persons shall in relation to any Bill, have power or jurisdiction

to inquire into, or pronounce upon, the constitutionality of such Bill or its due

compliance with the legislative process, on any ground whatsoever.

[emphasis added]

Moreover, the phrase its due compliance with the legislative process in Article 124 shows that

the Supreme Court is vested with the jurisdiction to determine whether the legislative process has

been duly complied with in respect of a Bill, subject to Articles 120, 121 and 122 of the

Constitution.

However, once a Bill becomes law, in terms of Article 124 of the Constitution, no court or tribunal,

etc. have the power or jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of a Bill or its due compliance

with the legislative process, on any ground whatsoever. The phrase on any ground whatsoever

has been used by the legislation to give a wide meaning to said Article. Thus, this court has no

power or jurisdiction to inquire into or pronounce upon the legislative process that has taken place

in enacting the said Bill into law or the constitutionality of the Bill.

A similar view was expressed by a full bench of the Supreme Court in Wijewickrema v. Attorney

General (1982) 2 SLR 775 where it was held;

On the alleged ground that 144 members of Parliament had signed and delivered

undated letters resigning their office to His Excellency the President, the plaintiff

contends that the said 144 members of Parliament were incapable of voting

according to the law and the Constitution for the Fourth Amendment to the

Constitution on the 4th November, 1982, and that notwithstanding the purported

certification of the Speaker of the Parliament that the Fourth Amendment to the

10

Constitution has been duly passed by a two-thirds majority of Parliament, the

Fourth Amendment to the Constitution is not a Bill that has been duly passed by

the Parliament at all and cannot therefore be submitted to the People at a

Referendum.

The fundamental question involved in this action is whether Article 124 of the

Constitution bars the jurisdiction of any Court to decide the constitutional issue

raised by plaintiff.

In our view the plaintiffs action involves basically the question whether the Fourth

Amendment to the Constitution has been validly voted upon as a Bill for the

amendment of the Constitution. Our unanimous decision in this basic question is

that the Court is barred by the provisions of Article 124 of the Constitution which

provides:

Save as otherwise provided in Article 120, 121 and 122 no Court

shall in relation to any Bill, have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon, the constitutionality of such Bill or its due

compliance with the legislative process, on any ground whatsoever.

from inquiring into or pronouncing upon the validity of the Bill for the amendment

of the Constitution, referred to in the plaint.

Applicability of Article 80(3) of the Constitution

Further Article 80(3) of the Constitution states;

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as

the case may be being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into,

pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on

any ground whatsoever.

[emphasis added]

11

It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the provisions stipulated under

Article 80(3) would not be a bar to reviewing the constitutionality of a Bill passed purportedly by

Parliament if due legislative process stipulated in the Constitution has not been complied with.

Hence, it was submitted that the certificate of the Speaker does not provide validity to the

legislative process, which has missed a vital step in legislating the Act.

Article 80(1) of the Constitution states that a Bill passed by Parliament becomes law upon the

Certificate of the Speaker being endorsed thereon. Further, in terms of Article 80(3) of the

Constitution, no court or institution administering justice may inquire into, pronounce upon or in

any manner call in question, the validity of an Act on any ground whatsoever. Moreover, the

phrase on any ground whatsoever in the said Article has ousted the jurisdiction of courts,

tribunals, etc. in considering the validity of a law after the Speaker endorses the certificate under

Article 79 of the Constitution, even if an Act is passed in Parliament without adhering to the due

legislative process as stipulated in the Constitution.

A similar view was held in Gamage v Perera (2006) 3 SLR 354 at 359 where it was held;

Article 80(3) of the Constitution refers to a Bill becoming law and reads

as follows:

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the

Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no Court or tribunal shall

inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such

Act on any ground whatsoever.

The aforesaid Article thus had clearly stated that in terms of that Article,

the constitutional validity of any provision of an Act of Parliament cannot be called

in question after the certificate of the President or the Speaker is given. Reference

was made to the provisions in Article 80(3) of the Constitution and its applicability

by Sharvananda, J. in re the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and had

expressed his Lordships views in the following terms:

Such a law cannot be challenged on any ground whatsoever even if it

conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution, even if it is not competent for

Parliament to enact it by a simple majority or two third majority.

12

In the circumstances, Article 80(3) of the Constitution has taken away the power and the

jurisdiction of this court in inquiring into, pronouncing upon the matters referred to in the petition

filed in the instant application, including the legality of the endorsement made by the 1st respondent

in the certificate issued to the Online Safety Bill.

Applicability of Article 70 of the Constitution

The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the 1st respondent has endorsed the certificate under

Article 79 of the Constitution when Parliament remained prorogued. Hence, the 1st respondent is

not entitled in law to make the endorsement in the certificate of the Bill. Thus, the Bill has not

become law in terms of Article 80(1) of the Constitution.

Article 70 (3) and (4) of the Constitution reads as follows;

(3) A Proclamation proroguing Parliament shall fix a date for the next session,

not being more than two months after the date of the Proclamation:

Provided that at any time while Parliament stands prorogued the President

may by Proclamation

(i) summon Parliament for an earlier date, not being less than three

days from the date of such Proclamation; or

(ii) subject to the provisions of this Article, dissolve Parliament.

(4) All matters which, having been duly brought before Parliament, have not been

disposed of at the time of the prorogation of Parliament, may be proceeded with

during the next session.

Article 70(4) of the Constitution refers to matters pending before Parliament at the time of the

prorogation of Parliament. As stated above, the certificate issued by the 1st respondent under

Article 79 of the Constitution is the last step in the legislative process. Hence, in terms of Article

124 of the Constitution, this court has no power or jurisdiction to consider whether the certificate

issued by the 1st respondent in respect of the Bill is contrary to Article 70 of the Constitution, and

thereby the Online Safety Bill has not become law.

13

Mistakes or omissions in enacting legislation

If any mistakes or omissions takes place in the legislative process in enacting laws the remedy is

to amend the relevant law. Such an amendment can be effected either by an amendment proposed

by the Government or by way of an amendment brought before Parliament as a Private Members

Bill.

Erskine May Parliamentary Practice (24th Edition) at page 183 states;

A law might be unjust or contrary to sound principles of government; but

Parliament was not controlled in its discretion, and when it erred, its errors could

be corrected only by itself

Hence, if the suggestions made in the determination with regard to the Online Safety Bill have

not been incorporated into the Bill before it was passed into law, either the Government or a

Member of Parliament can take steps to move an amendment in Parliament to rectify such errors

or omissions in enacting the legislation. Furthermore, in view of the aforementioned ouster clauses

in the Constitution, the legislative process is not justitiable.

The learned counsel for the petitioner cited Jackson and others v Her Majestys Attorney General

[2005] UKHL 56 in support of his contention. However, the said case has no application to the

instant application as ouster clauses in respect of the legislative process and post review of laws

have been enshrined in our Constitution.

Conclusion

A careful consideration of the provisions of the Constitution shows that the legislature has

intentionally ousted the jurisdiction of courts, tribunals, etc., not only reviewing the legislation

passed by Parliament but also the legislative process in enacting legislation on any ground

whatsoever. In this regard, the legislature has included two separate Articles in the Constitution

to oust the jurisdiction of courts, tribunals, etc. Thus, it shows the importance placed by the drafters

of the Constitution in preventing courts, tribunals, etc. from interfering not only with the legislative

process but also the laws passed by Parliament. Thus, Articles 80(3) and 124 of the Constitution

have prevented the post legislative scrutiny of Acts passed by Parliament on any ground

whatsoever.

14

Moreover, the phrase on any ground whatsoever prevents this court exercising power or

jurisdiction in considering the matters referred to in the instant petition as they refer to the

legislative process.

In the circumstances, the preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General are upheld.

Therefore, leave to proceed is refused and the application is dismissed without costs.
