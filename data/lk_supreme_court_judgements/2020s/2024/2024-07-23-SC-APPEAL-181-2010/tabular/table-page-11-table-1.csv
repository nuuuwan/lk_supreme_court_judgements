"had been using the road-way even in the year 1996 and had a right of way to his"
"property over lot 30 for more than a decade."
"Having referred to the submissions made by both parties, let me now consider the"
"said submissions and the legal implications arising therein, in the light of the instant appeal."
"The genesis of the instant appeal is a pure and simple Section 66 application."
"Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, (“the Act”) makes provision for"
"a police officer to file a report or an information in the Primary Court, in the event a dispute"
"relating to land, which is likely to cause a breach of the peace has arisen."
"Section 67 of the Act makes provision for an expeditious inquiry (to be concluded"
"within  three  months)  and  delivery  of  order  (within  one  week  of  the  conclusion  of  the"
"inquiry),  which  amply  emphasize  the  clear  intention  of  the  drafter,  that  the  relief  to  be"
"granted by the Primary Court is to find a solution fast and avert a breach of the peace. In"
"my view, it is not to determine the rights of the parties which is a privilege empowered on"
"a civil court."
"Section 68 of the Act makes provision for a judge of the Primary Court to determine"
"and make order, when the dispute relates to the possession of any land and Section 69 of"
"the Act refers to disputes in regard to any other right of any land, respectively."
"Admittedly,  the  instant  appeal  is  not  in  respect  of  ‘possession’  of  any  land  and"
"hence, does not come within Section 68 of the Act."
"This appeal is in respect of ‘any other right’ viz, relating to a right of way and/or a"
"road-way, and thus falls within Section 69 of the Act."
