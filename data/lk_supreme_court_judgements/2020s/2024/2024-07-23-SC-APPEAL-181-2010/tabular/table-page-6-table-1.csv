"","and enjoyed the right of way over lot 30, the road-way, without any hindrance"
"","or obstruction to access their land;"
"-","The original owners and subsequent owners of lots 28 and 29 too, used the said"
"","road-way (lot 30) together with F E Perera and the 1st Party, without any incident"
"","of  a  breach  of  the  peace,  except  on  one  occasion  in  the  year  1995  when  F  E"
"","Perera obstructed one Tissa Hewage, owner of lot 29 from using such road-way."
"","A  Section  66  application  was  filed  and  a  direction  was  made  to  remove  the"
"","obstruction and permit Tissa Hewage to have access to the road-way lot 30;"
