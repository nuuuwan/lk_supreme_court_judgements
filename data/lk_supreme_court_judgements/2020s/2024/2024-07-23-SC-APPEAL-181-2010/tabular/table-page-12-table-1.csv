"restraining order made by an umpire to keep two warring factions to hold their peace. Such"
"an order is valid and enforceable only until a competent court by an order or decree resolves"
"the dispute or the points of contention between the parties."
"At this instance, I wish to consider Section 66 of the Act, in greater detail."
"Section 66 reads as follows;"
"(1)  Whenever  owing  to  a  dispute  affecting  land  a  breach  of  the"
"peace is threatened or likely-"
"(a) The police officer inquiring into the dispute"
"(i)  shall  with  the  least  possible  delay  file  an  information"
"regarding the dispute in the Primary Court […]; or"
"(ii) shall, if necessary in the interests of preserving the peace,"
"arrest the parties […]"
"(2)  Where  an  information  is  filed  in  a  Primary  Court  under  sub"
"section (1), the Primary Court shall have and is hereby vested"
"with jurisdiction to inquire into, and make a determination or"
"order  on,  in  the  manner  provided  for  in  this  part,  the  dispute"
"regarding which the information is filed.” (emphasis added)"
"Thus, the Primary Court is empowered under this Act and is vested with jurisdiction"
"to inquire into and make a determination, in a speedy manner where a breach of the peace"
"is threatened or is likely, regarding a dispute affecting land."
"In my view, the paramount concern addressed by Section 66 is to keep peace"
"and to maintain peace between disputing parties."
"The police force is tasked with the duty of maintaining peace. In the event a police"
"officer inquiring into a dispute affecting land, is unable to or is not in a position to maintain"
"peace, this section empowers such police officer to bring the issue before the Primary Court"
"and for the Primary Court to look into the matter and make an order, as a stop-gap measure"
"to maintain peace, until a competent court determines the issue. In other words, maintain"
"the status-quo. It is a short term measure to avert a breach of the peace."
"The Appellant in his post-hearing written submissions strenuously argued, that the"
"Primary Court has no jurisdiction to inquire into matters affecting land. The first argument"
"put  forward  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  was  that  Section  32(2)  of  the  Judicature  Act"
"specifically excludes, matters referred to in the 4th schedule from the purview of the Primary"
"Court and since ‘any action for a declaratory decree including a declaration to the title to"
"the land’ is excluded by the 4th schedule to the Judicature Act, the Primary Court is devoid"
"of jurisdiction, even to issue an order to maintain the status-quo."
"However, it has to be borne in mind that during the hearing, the learned President’s"
"Counsel informed Court that he will not pursue this contention, since the said section has"
"been omitted from the statute books. Thus, the Respondent too, has not responded to the"
"submission pertaining to Section 32(2) of the Judicature Act."
