"requires  the  court  to  determine  the  question  which  party  is"
"entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an order under"
"Section 69(2).” (emphasis added)"
"The above quotation, in my view is obiter. But it clearly underscores that a Primary"
"Court has the jurisdiction to determine which party has acquired that right or is entitled for"
"the  time  being  to  exercise  that  right.  It  specifically  states,  ‘the  party  for  the  time  being"
"exercising such right’. In my view, by this passage, Sharvananda, J., distinguishes Sections"
"68 and 69 and states, even in a Section 69 situation, which party is entitled or for the time"
"being exercising such right ought to be considered, prior to making an order for maintaining"
"peace."
"In my view, this does not mean that the Primary Court, determines ownership.  It"
"only considers the acquisition of the right or the entitlement for the time being of the right."
"Hence, my considered view is that this paragraph should be viewed and understood in the"
"said  light  and  not  in  the  manner  contended  by  the  Appellant,  that  the  ownership  is  the"
"paramount factor that a judge should consider in cases of this nature."
"Thus, I see no merit in the submissions of the Appellant, that ‘entitlement’ equals"
"or is the same as ‘ownership’, and in view of the jurisdiction relating to ‘any action for a"
"declaratory decree including a declaration to the title to the land’ being taken away by the"
"4th  schedule  to  the  Judicature  Act  [vide  Section  32(2)],  that  the  Primary  Court  lacks"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine this case."
"In contradistinction to the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant, I am of the"
"view that the judgement of Ramalingam v. Thangarajah (supra) clearly lays down, that"
"a Primary Court has jurisdiction to determine which of the parties has acquired that right"
"[right of way] or is entitled for the time being to exercise such right [right of way] prior"
"to making an order under Section 69(2) of the Act."
"If I may digress further and go to Section 69(2) referred to earlier, the said section"
"clearly and unambiguously makes provision for a court to make order, declaring any person"
"specified therein is entitled to any such right, until such person is deprived of such right"
"by virtue of an order or decree of a competent court."
"Thus, the argument of the Appellant that an order made by a Primary Court is a"
"declaratory decree pertaining to the title to the land is erroneous and has no force in law."
"The order made by the Primary Court is not a final order. It is only a provisional order made"
"to preserve the breach of the peace and to maintain the status-quo, until the party being"
"deprived of the right, goes before a competent court and obtains an order or decree in its"
"favour."
"Hence in my view, the Primary Court has jurisdiction to make orders pertaining to"
"land, in instances in which a breach of the peace is threatened or likely, as laid down in"
"Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
