"","Another argument put forward by the Appellant to justify the lack of jurisdiction of",""

"","In the aforesaid Sriyawathie Jayasinghe v. Karunaratne (supra) judgement, the",""
"grievance of the Appellant was that the Respondent was falsely claiming a right of way","",""

"over the Appellant’s land. The learned Magistrate, having visited the land one year after","",""

"contended, but a foot path.","",""
"","Having considered the facts therein, the Court of Appeal in the said Sriyawathie",""

"Magistrate misdirected herself and applied a wrong principle. Further, the court held that","",""
"the Magistrate should have considered the provisions of Section 69. In the order, the learned","",""
"appellate  judge    in  passing  referred  to  Ramalingam’s  case  and  the  dicta  that  a  person","",""
"claiming a right of way should prove he is entitled to such right and ‘mere user’ will not","",""

for 
the  Appellant,","relying  heavily  on

"","Once again, I see no merit in the said submission. As discussed in detail earlier in",""
"this judgement, the parameters of the Primary Court Judge or what the Primary Court has","",""

"Nevertheless, a party deprived of a right could at any time obtain relief from a competent","",""
