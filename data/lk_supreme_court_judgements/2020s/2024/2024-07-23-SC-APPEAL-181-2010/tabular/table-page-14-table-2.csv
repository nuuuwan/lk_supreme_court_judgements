"The  observations  of  Sharvananda,  J.,  with  regard  to  possession  in  the  aforesaid"
"Ramalingam’s case (supra at page 698 and 699) were as follows;"
"“That person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by"
"due process of law. A judge should therefore in an inquiry under Part"
"VII  of  the  aforesaid  Act,  confine  himself  to  the  question  of  actual"
"possession […] He is not to decide any question of title or right to"
"possession of the parties to the land. Evidence bearing on title can"
"be considered only when the evidence as to possession is clearly"
"balanced  and  the  presumption  of  possession  which  flows  from"
"title  may  tilt  the  balance  in  favour  of  the  owner  and  help  in"
"deciding the question of possession.” (emphasis added)"
