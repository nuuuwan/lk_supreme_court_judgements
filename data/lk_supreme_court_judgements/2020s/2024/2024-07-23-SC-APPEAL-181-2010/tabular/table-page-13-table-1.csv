"Nevertheless, in the written submissions the Appellant has gone into an exhaustive"
"analysis of the provisions of the Judicature Act and the number of amendments brought to"
"Section 32(2). The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, examines at length the"
"said  amendments  and  whether  such  amendments  were  gazetted  or  not  and,  the  legal"
"ramification of the amendments which were gazetted and the amendments which were not"
"gazetted. He also refers to the establishment of Small Claims Courts and its jurisdiction."
"I do not intend to go on an academic discourse pertaining to this contention of the"
"Appellant.  Suffice  it  to  state  that  the  Judicature  Act  provides  for  the  establishment  and"
"constitution of a system of courts of first instance. It defines the jurisdiction of such courts"
"and regulates the parameters of such courts. It is undisputed that the competent court to"
"determine  a  civil  dispute  is  the  District  Court,  subject  to  the  monetary  value  and  other"
"specific matters referred to in the Judicature Act and the Primary Court has no jurisdiction"
"to hear and determine disputes affecting land."
"However, the appeal before us, pertains to a breach of the peace situation owing to"
"a dispute affecting land. In such instances, i.e., a breach of the peace situation, there is clear"
"and unambiguous provision in the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act for the police to file a"
"Section 66 application in the Primary Court and the Primary Court to hear and determine"
"such matter relating to the breach of the peace."
"Furthermore,  Chapter  VII  of  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure  Act,  very  clearly"
"identifies that the provisions therein are only in relation to ‘a dispute affecting land where"
"a  breach  of  the  peace  is  threatened  or  is  likely  to  happen’.  The  dominant  factor  is  the"
"‘breach of the peace’.  Then only the Primary  Court has jurisdiction to consider  such an"
"application and make an order for the parties to maintain peace, until a competent court"
"makes  a  determination  pertaining  to  the  rights  of  the  said  parties.  Resorting  to  the"
"provisions of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act is only a stop-gap measure to maintain"
"peace or to uphold the status-quo and to prevent the happening of an unforeseen incident."
"This is more so, when the local police is unable to curb an incident and resolve the matter"
"and prevent the happening of a disaster which would be of a much more magnitude."
"Hence, my considered view, is that the Primary Court has jurisdiction to look into"
"the  instant  matter.  The  argument  of  the  Appellant  pertaining  to  Section  32(2)  of  the"
"Judicature Act has no merit. It has no bearing whatsoever, on the instant appeal."
"The next contention of the learned President’s Counsel representing the Appellant,"
"pertained to Sections 68 and 69 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. He submitted that"
"there was a vast difference between Sections 68 and 69 and the guiding factor or the pivotal"
"point  was  the  ‘ownership’.  He  went  on  to  contend,  that  Section  68  is  in  respect  of  a"
"determination  when  the  dispute  is  in  regard  to  ‘possession’  where  ownership  is  not  an"
"issue,  Section  69  speaks  of  ‘entitlement  to  a  right’  where  the  dispute  is  woven  around"
"‘ownership’."
"Thus, he submitted that ‘ownership’ is a sine-qua-non, when an application is filed"
"under Section 69 of the Act. The learned President’s Counsel vehemently emphasized that"
"‘entitlement is ownership’, and found solace in the dicta of Sharvananda J., in the case of"
"Ramalingam v. Thangarajah (supra) to buttress his argument."
