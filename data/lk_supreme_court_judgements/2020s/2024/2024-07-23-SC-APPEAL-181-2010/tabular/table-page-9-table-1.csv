"First,"
"T
he Primary Court has no jurisdiction to determine this matter, since Section 32(2)"
"of the  Judicature Act  No 2 of 1978  lays down, that  any action for a  declaratory"
"decree  including  a  declaration  to  the  title  to  the  land,  [vide  item  12  in  the  4th"
"schedule] is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Primary Court."
"To emphasise the said contention, the learned President’s Counsel relied on the dicta"
"in the case of Ramalingam v. Thangarajah (supra), wherein he submitted the word"
"‘entitled’ was considered as ‘ownership’."
"T
he argument put  forward by the learned President’s Counsel was that the order"
"made by the Primary Court amounted to a ‘declaration’ that the party claiming the"
"right  is  ‘entitled’  to  the  said  right.  Thus,  it  was  contended  that  the  order  of  the"
"Primary Court amounted to a declaration that the 1st Party owned the right of way"
"over lot 30 and the Primary Court has no jurisdiction to make such an order."
