"The third and final ground relied upon by the Appellant to justify its contention was"
"factual in nature, i.e., the Respondent has no right to use lot 30, based upon the evidence"
"before Court."
"Upon perusal of the impugned orders of the Primary Court, the High Court and the"
"Court of Appeal, it is quite clear, that the learned trial judge and the appellate judges have"
"considered the evidence before the trial court, i.e., the blocked-out plan, the layout of roads,"
"viz, lots 34 and 35 (the twenty-foot main road) and lots 30, 31, 32 and 33 (the ten-foot by-"
"roads which lead to specific residential blocks) and came to the finding that lot 30 leads to"
"the Respondent’s land. Further, the impugned orders indicate that the judges of the trial"
"court  and  the  appellate  courts  examined  the  documents,  the  orders  and  specifically  the"
"decree tendered to court relating to a Section 66 application filed in 1995 against one Tissa"
"Hewage, where the Magistrate Court of Colombo, accepted lot 30 as a road-way. This order"
"was made, way before the Appellant came to the picture and purchased lot 28 in the year"
"2003."
"Hence, I see no reason to hold that the impugned order is pervasive or erroneous."
"Based on the factual matrix, the learned judge of the trial court correctly determined that"
"the Respondent is entitled to use lot 30 as a road-way. The appellate courts rightly upheld"
"this finding of the trial judge, for reasons morefully stated therein."
"Thus, I see no merit in the contention of the Appellant, that the Primary Court, the"
"High Court and the Court of Appeal have gone on a voyage of discovery and conjectured"
"and surmised, to determine the ownership or entitlement of such right of the Respondent to"
"use lot 30 as a road-way."
"In my view, the learned trial judge has acted within his jurisdiction as specifically"
"laid down in Section 69(2) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, and ascertained as to"
"who is entitled to the right which is the subject of dispute. Moreover, the trial judge and the"
"learned  judges  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  have  emphatically  stated,  that  the  order  of  the"
"Primary  Court  is  not  a  permanent  order  and  that  the  parties  are  entitled  to  obtain  a"
"permanent solution to the ‘dispute’, from a competent civil court."
"If I may digress once more, the learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant in his"
"written submissions laboured very much to put forward the contention that the ownership"
"of a land or a right to use a road-way is acquired by numerous ways and there is no order"
"in  favour  of  the  Respondent  from  a  competent  court  to  such  effect.  In  fact,  the  learned"
"Counsel drew the attention of Court to modes of acquisition of lands or servitudinal rights"
"by prescription, expropriation and testament etc."
"Having referred to such modes of acquisition, the learned Counsel submitted that"
"the Respondent is not entitled to obtain an order  favourable to the Respondent from the"
"Primary Court, as the Respondent has failed to prove her entitlement or ownership to lot"
"30 or the right to use lot 30 as a road-way through one of the said modes of acquisition."
