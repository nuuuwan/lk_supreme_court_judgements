Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Homagama against

the 1st defendant seeking declaration of title to, ejectment of the

defendant from, the land described in the schedule to the plaint, and

damages. The plaintiffs position was that he became the owner of the

land by the Deed of Transfer marked P3. The 1st defendant filed answer

seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action. Her position was that P3 is not

an outright transfer although it appears to be so, but rather a mortgage.

She also averred that her four children should be added as defendants.

Those four children were subsequently added as 2nd to 5th defendants.

Thereafter the 1st defendant passed away and the plaintiffs Attorney-at-

Law informed the Court that the plaintiff would proceed with the case

only against the 2nd to 5th defendants. There was no objection to this

application.

The 2nd to 5th defendants filed a joint answer dated 03.02.1998 seeking

dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration that the 2nd to 5th

defendants are the absolute owners of the land. Additionally, they prayed

that in the event the case is decided in favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff

should be ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000 to the said defendants for

improvements. It is significant to note that, the 2nd to 5th defendants filed

this answer after the death of the 1st defendant. The prayer to the answer

of the 2nd to 5th defendants reads as follows:

2, 3, 4 5

,

() ,

() 6() 6() 7

2, 3, 4 5 ,

()

(. 100 000/-)

.

In paragraph 6 of the said answer, the 2nd to 5th defendants claimed title

to the land on prescriptive possession. They did not state that P3 is a

mortgage, not a transfer.

At the trial, issues were raised on the aforesaid basis. After trial, the

District Court entered judgment for the plaintiff.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, the 2nd to 5th

defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal of

Avissawella. The High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court

on the basis that, since the plaintiff did not take steps to proceed with

the case against the 1st defendant, the District Court should have abated

the action. The High Court concluded:

This action of the Plaintiff cannot be maintained as he has failed to

establish his title against the deceased 1st Defendant without taking

steps for substitution. Hence, I have not considered the facts of this

case lengthily due to the procedural errors of this case.

6

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

The plaintiff came before this Court against the judgment of the High

Court. This Court granted leave to appeal on the following question of

law:

Was there any necessity for substituting the legal representatives in

the room of the deceased when the legal representatives had

already been parties to the action and when they had no desire to

proceed with the reliefs sought by the deceased 1st defendant and

instead had made a claim in reconvention on their own?

In the impugned judgment, the High Court refers to several sections of

the Civil Procedure Code relating to the death of parties, survival of the

cause of action, substitution, amendment of pleadings, etc. The entire

discussion in the judgment of the High Court focuses on procedural

errors, not on the merits of the case. As I quoted above, the learned High

Court Judge made it very clear when she concluded, I have not

considered the facts of this case lengthily due to the procedural errors of

this case.

The wise words of Chief Justice Abrahams, expressed nearly nine

decades ago in Vellupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District Council (1936)

39 NLR 464 at 465, echo in my mind: This is a Court of Justice, it is not

an Academy of Law.

I must state that none of the alleged procedural errors were raised

before the District Court by the 2nd to 5th defendants. They presented

their case before the District Court as they had pleaded in their answer

(which I narrated above) and raised issues and led evidence on that basis.

Having failed the case on the merits in the trial Court, they cannot render

the judgment nugatory by pointing out procedural defects for the first

time before the appellate Court.

7

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

It is stated in Sir John Woodroffe & Ameer Alis Commentary on The Code

of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act No. 5 of 1908) (5th edn, Vol 1, 2009, Delhi

Law House) at pages 1108-1109, that as a general rule, questions on

technicality cannot be raised as substantial questions of law on appeal.

Once the suit is decided on merits by two subordinate Courts, the

appellants cannot be allowed to raise technical pleas in second

appeal with emphasis that these technicalities should be treated to

be substantial questions of law. The question of misjoinder of parties

and multifariousness of causes of action cannot be permitted to be

raised under Sec. 100 C.P.C. treating it to be a substantial question

of law. If the technicalities are pitted against substantial justice then

the Court of law cannot allow the substantial justice either to escape

or to slide on mere technicalities. The Courts of appeal are respected

by the people not because of the fact that it can legalise injustice but

because the Courts impart substantial justice between the parties.

Hence, these questions of technicalities also cannot be treated to be

substantial questions of law. (Khema and Others v. Shri Bhagwan

and Others AIR 1995 Raj 94, at pp.96, 97.)

In Iqbal Ismail Sodawala v. State of Maharasthra and Others 1974 AIR

1880, the Supreme Court considered whether a conviction is vitiated due

to the Trial Judges non-compliance with the procedural requirement of

signing the judgment. The Court answered this question in the negative

on the basis that the appellant had not raised this issue in the High Court

and that this procedural irregularity had not resulted in a failure of

justice.

Question next arises as to whether the above irregularity can be said

to have occasioned failure of justice. So far as this aspect is

concerned, we find that the judgment was ultimately transcribed

and was signed by the learned Sessions Judge. The appellant was

8

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

thereafter supplied a copy of the judgment and he filed an appeal

against the judgment of the trial court. The appeal was dismissed

by the Bombay High Court on September 13, 1973. In case the

appellant felt aggrieved against the procedural irregularity

mentioned above, the appellant should have agitated that point in

appeal before the High Court. The fact that the appeal of the

appellant was dismissed shows that either the appellant did not

agitate that point in appeal before the High Court or in case he did

so, the High Court found no substance therein. It cannot in the

circumstances be said that the procedural irregularity mentioned

above has occasioned failure of justice. As the judgment of the

learned Sessions Judge has been affirmed on appeal by the High

Court and the appeal of the appellant has been dismissed, the

appellant, in our opinion, cannot be said to be kept in prison without

the authority of law.

In Dabare v. Appuhamy [1980] 2 Sri LR 54 the defendant sought to

dismiss the plaintiffs action on res judicata but the objection was

overruled. On appeal by the defendant, the plaintiff submitted that the

dismissal of his former action was invalid as the Court had followed the

wrong procedure, in that, instead of summary procedure, regular

procedure had been followed. The plaintiff had not objected to the wrong

procedure being followed in the original Court. Rejecting that argument

and allowing the appeal, the Court stated that notwithstanding that the

wrong procedure had been followed, the order of dismissal made by the

Court was valid since the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine

the action and the plaintiff did not take objection to the wrong procedure

being followed at that time. Wrong procedure can be validated by

acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of the parties.

9

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

In Elias v. Muhajid A. Cader and Another (SC/APPEAL/50/08, SC

Minutes of 28.06.2011) the issue was whether the first power of attorney

had adequate authority to file action against both defendants. The

objection taken by the defendant was observed by Justice Suresh

Chandra as being highly technical:

It is a highly technical matter which has delayed the dispensation of

justice in this case regarding a matter which needed quick disposal.

For the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections

should be discouraged and parties should be encouraged to seek

justice by dealing with the merits of cases. Raising of such technical

objections and dealing with them and the subsequent challenges on

them to the superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to

the delay and the backlog of cases pending in Courts. Very often the

dealing of such technicalities become only an academic exercise with

which the litigants would not be interested. The delay in

dispensation of justice can be minimized if parties are discouraged

from taking up technical objections which takes up valuable judicial

time. What is important for litigants would be their aspiration to get

justice from courts on merits rather than on technicalities. As has

often been quoted it must be remembered that Courts of law are

Courts of justice and not academies of law.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution which defines the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal reads:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by

the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction

or by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and

sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and

10

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all other laws must

be interpreted consistent with the Constitution. The language of the

proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution makes it mandatory for the

Court of Appeal not to reverse or vary the judgments, decrees or orders

of the original Courts on any error, defect, or irregularity unless it is

shown that such error, defect, or irregularity has prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. The

Constitution places a premium on substantive justice over rigid

procedural compliance.

Provincial High Courts exercising civil appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction over judgments and orders of the District Courts must adhere

to this. Section 5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act, No. 19 of 1990 (which was introduced by Act No. 54 of 2006) reads

as follows:

5A. (1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

for a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered

and made by any District Court or a Family Court within such

Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors

in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such District Court

or Family Court, as the case may be.

11

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of

1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to

the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the

Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a

reference to a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved by any

judgment, decree or order of a District Court or a Family Court, as

the case may be, within a Province, may invoke the jurisdiction

referred to in that subsection, in the High Court established for that

Province:

Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a Family

Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by the High

Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.

In Kiri Mahaththaya and Another v. Attorney General [2020] 1 Sri LR 10

at 18-19, Justice Aluwihare emphasized that the Judges have no option

but to comply with the constitutional provisions couched in mandatory

terms:

With the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, if relief is to be

obtained in an appeal, a party must satisfy the threshold

requirement laid down in the proviso to Article 138(1), which is

placed under the heading The Court of Appeal. The proviso to the

said Article of the Constitution lays down that Provided that no

judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

12

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms and the burden

is on the party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned

error, defect or irregularity has either prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. It must be

observed that no such Constitutional provision is to be found either

in the 1948 Soulbury Constitution or the First Republican

Constitution of 1972.

The Constitutional provision embodied in Article 138(1) cannot be

overlooked and must be given effect to. None of the decisions (made

after 1978) relied upon by the Appellants with regard to the issue

that this court is now called upon to decide, appear to have

considered the constitutional provision in the proviso to Article

138(1). It is a well-established canon of interpretation, that the

Constitution overrides a statute as the grundnorm. All statutes must

be construed in line with the highest law. Judges from time

immemorial have in their limited capacity, essayed to fill the gaps

whenever it occurred to them, in keeping with the contemporary

times, in statutes which do not align with the Constitution. However,

such interpretations are not words etched in stone.

As the respected American jurist, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo said,

The rules and principles of case law have never been treated as

final truths, but as working hypotheses, continually retested in those

great laboratories of the law, the courts of justice. Every new case is

an experiment; and if the accepted rule which seems applicable

yields a result which is felt to be unjust, the rule is reconsidered

(The Nature of the Judicial Process, 1921).

The learned counsel on behalf of the Accused-Appellants had heavily

relied on a number of decisions handed down by this court as well

as by the Court of Appeal, in support of the proposition that the trial

13

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

should be declared a nullity in view of the non-compliance with

Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. However, I am of

the view that these decisions need to be revisited in light of the

Constitutional provision referred to above.

In Ranmenika and Others v. Perera [2019] 1 Sri LR 282 at 287, Justice

Janak De Silva pointed out that proviso to Article 138(1) of the

Constitution would prevail over the Civil Procedure Code.

Clearly the constitutional provisions prevail over section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code. I hold that even if a trial judge has failed to

answer all the issues raised and accepted by Court the judgment

need not be reversed or varied if such error defect or irregularity has

not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. One such instance is where upon a close

examination of the totality of the evidence it is found that the learned

District Judge is correct in pronouncing the judgment.

After the death of their mother (the 1st defendant), the 2nd to 5th

defendants filed a separate answer and contested the case on their own.

They did not take up any objection regarding the procedure in the District

Court. They waived any objections and acquiesced to the procedure. Even

if there were procedural errors, no prejudice has been caused to the 2nd

to 5th defendant thereby. The High Court of Civil Appeal has not adverted

to these express provisions which prevent the High Court from setting

aside the judgments of the District Court on procedural defects unless

such defects caused prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

I answer the question of law raised before this Court as follows: Since the

2nd to 5th defendants contested the case on their own, there was no

necessity to abate the action upon the death of the 1st defendant.

14

SC/APPEAL/49/2014

I set aside the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and restore the

judgment of the District Court and allow the appeal. Let the parties bear

their own costs.
