"Once the suit is decided on merits by two subordinate Courts, the"
"appellants  cannot  be  allowed  to  raise  technical  pleas  in  second"
"appeal with emphasis that these technicalities should be treated to"
"be substantial questions of law. The question of misjoinder of parties"
"and multifariousness of causes of action cannot be permitted to be"
"raised under Sec. 100 C.P.C. treating it to be a substantial question"
"of law. If the technicalities are pitted against substantial justice then"
"the Court of law cannot allow the substantial justice either to escape"
"or to slide on mere technicalities. The Courts of appeal are respected"
"by the people not because of the fact that it can legalise injustice but"
"because the Courts impart substantial justice between the parties."
"Hence, these questions of technicalities also cannot be treated to be"
"substantial questions of law. (Khema and Others v. Shri Bhagwan"
