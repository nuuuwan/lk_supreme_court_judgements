"appellant, in our opinion, cannot be said to be kept in prison without"
"the authority of law."
"In  Dabare  v.  Appuhamy  [1980]  2  Sri  LR  54  the  defendant  sought  to"
"dismiss  the  plaintiffâ€™s  action  on  res 
judicata  but  the  objection  was"
"overruled. On appeal by the defendant, the plaintiff submitted that the"
"dismissal of his former action was invalid as the Court had followed the"
"wrong  procedure, 
in 
that, 
instead  of  summary  procedure,  regular"
"procedure had been followed. The plaintiff had not objected to the wrong"
"procedure being followed in the original Court. Rejecting that argument"
"and allowing the appeal, the Court stated that notwithstanding that the"
"wrong procedure had been followed, the order of dismissal made by the"
"Court was valid since the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine"
"the action and the plaintiff did not take objection to the wrong procedure"
"being 
followed  at  that  time.  Wrong  procedure  can  be  validated  by"
"acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of the parties."
