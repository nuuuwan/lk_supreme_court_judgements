"The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms and the burden"
"is on the party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned"
"error,  defect  or  irregularity  has  either  prejudiced the  substantial"
"rights of the parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. It must be"
"observed that no such Constitutional provision is to be found either"
"in 
the 
1948  Soulbury  Constitution
