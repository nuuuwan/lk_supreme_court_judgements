"rate  of  32%  till  the  money  due  is  fully  paid.  The  case  record  shows  that  it  was  not  a  claim"
"commencing from the plaint for the first time, but a claim made even prior to the institution of the"
"action."
"T
he cause of action was based on the refusal to release the deposit made in the Defendant Bank"
"along with the accrued interest against the wish of the Plaintiff based on an unacceptable claim of"
"right to set-off by the Defendant."
"I
t must be noted even prior to the sending of the letter demand, the Plaintiff put the Defendant on"
"notice that it would claim 32% interest for the delay in releasing the deposits - vide letter dated"
"04.05.2001 written by the General Manager of the Plaintiff, marked X25 with the Plaint. Thereafter"
"the Plaintiff through its lawyer, demanded the due amount along with 32% interest – vide letter"
"demand dated 14.5.2001, marked X27 with the Plaint. Again, the Plaintiff claimed the same 32%"
"interest through its Plaint."
"O
ther than taking up the stance that it had the right to setoff which this Court with reason adduced"
"refused to  accept,  the  Defendant had not, in  replying  to  the  aforesaid  letters, challenged in  the"
"alternative that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the interest at the rate of 32%. No issue was raised to"
"challenge the said rate of interest. Furthermore, on behalf of the Plaintiff, in evidence, the Plaintiff"
"had sought relief as prayed for in the Plaint and had given evidence in explaining during cross"
"examination that 32% was the default interest (going rate at the time) charged by the banks."
"I
t is not necessary to go into the facts of the matter as the main case now has been decided by this"
"Court. However, above factual situation was referred in this Order to show that this claim at the"
"rate of 32% was not properly challenged by the Defendant prior to the trial or during the trial and"
"also to show that it was a part of the claim by the Plaintiff as its entitlement even prior to the filing"
"of the Plaint. Thus, 32% interest was claimed as of a right or entitlement by the Plaintiff till the"
"payment in full is made and not as a discretionary relief to protect the interests of the Plaintiff in"
"terms of Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"T
he Defendant attempts to say that the learned High Court Judge dismissed the Plaint, thus, she"
"did not have a chance to consider the correctness of 32% interest rate. Even if she had a chance,"
"as explained before, it was not challenged in replying to the aforesaid letters including the letter"
"demand, by raising an issue or giving evidence in reply to the Plaintiff’s position."
"W
hen there is no issue raised to challenge the 32% interest rate claimed by the Plaintiff as of an"
"entitlement till the full amount is paid, it was a matter unchallenged for the Court below and a"
"Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery and come to a different conclusion. It is said on behalf"
"of the Defendant that 32% interest is unreasonable. Whether it is unreasonable or whether such"
"interest could be claimed by the Plaintiff, could have been challenged in the Court below or, at"
"least during the argument. On the other hand, holding on to the money of the Plaintiff based on an"
"unacceptable claim of right to set off is also unreasonable and the Plaintiff, at the very beginning,"
"put the Defendant on notice that it would claim 32% interest on the failure to release its money."
"A
s explained above, the 32% interest was granted till the payment in full as a claim unchallenged"
"before the Court below and not to preserve the interests of the Plaintiff in terms of the Section 192"
