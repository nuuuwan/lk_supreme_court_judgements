"T
he Judgement of this matter was delivered on 08.08.2024 allowing the appeal while setting aside"
"the Judgement of the Commercial High Court dated 12.10.2010 which dismissed the Plaint of the"
"Plaintiff-Appellant. While allowing the appeal, this Court granted the reliefs prayed for in prayer"
"(a), (b), (c) and (h) of the Plaint 06.06.2001."
"A
fter the pronouncement of the Judgement, the motion dated 05.08.2024 was filed on behalf of"
"the  Substituted  Defendant  –  Respondent  to  reconsider  the  granting  of  interest  in  prayer  ‘c’"
"aforesaid which was 32% on the premise that it was so granted per incuriam in ignorance of the"
"provision found in Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code. When that motion was supported,"
"both  parties  were  allowed  to  file  written  submissions  and  accordingly  they  have  filed  their"
"respective written submissions. For easy reference, the said prayer ‘c’ is quoted below:"
"“
(c) for judgement and decree against the defendant in a sum of Rs.78,400,000/- together with"
"interest thereon at 32% per annum from 5th May 2001 till payment in full.”"
"O
n the face of the above prayer, the Plaintiff had prayed in a manner claiming that he is entitled"
"to 32% from the date of the cause of action till the full amount is paid. Thus, the Plaintiff’s claim"
"in the Plaint was for a sum of money which included the said 32% interest till that entitlement is"
"fully paid. It was not a claim that prayed for a fixed sum and agreed interest up to the date of the"
"plaint stating that he is entitled to the legal interest from the date of the Plaint till the full amount"
"is paid. As per the said prayer, sum of monies claimed as of a right or entitlement is not only the"
"fixed amount mentioned therein but also the interest at the rate of 32% till everything is paid."
