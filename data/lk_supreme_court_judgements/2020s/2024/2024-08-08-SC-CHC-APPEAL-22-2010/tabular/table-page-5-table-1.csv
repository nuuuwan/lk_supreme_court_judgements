"(2) where an agreement to pay interest can be implied from the course of dealing between the"

3) in certain cases, by way of damages for a breach of contract (other than a contract merely to"
"pay money) where the contract, if performed, would to the knowledge of the parties have entitled"
"the plaintiff to receive interest."" (emphasis added). (See “The Law of Contracts” Volume II, at"

"T

"profession etc. subject to any limitations such as Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance."
"R
eferring to Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance and Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code,"
"Dr. Weeramantry, in his work ‘The Law of Contracts’, has stated as follows;"
"""
This section of the Civil Procedure Code does not in any way repeal the provisions contained in"
"section  3  (present  section  5)  of  the  Civil  Law  Ordinance  which  provides  that  the  amount"
"recoverable on account of interest or arrears of interest should in no case exceed the principal."
"The  latter  section  states  the  Roman  Dutch  Law  and  is  not  in  any  way  superseded  by  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code, which is merely a procedural enactment."
"S
ection 192 of the Civil Procedure Code does, however, confer on creditors an additional right in"
"this sense, that interest may be claimed for the period between plaint and judgment even in cases"
"where the interest claimed in the plaint already equals the amount of the principal. The date of"
"plaint is thus the time at which the line is drawn in calculating the limit of interest allowed under"
"the Civil Law Ordinance, the underlying principle being that the creditor’s rights ought not to"
"be prejudiced by the length of resistance offered in court by the debtor."" (Volume 2 page 932,"
"section 955), (emphasis added)."
"I
t is true what is quoted above was mainly to indicate that any interest due subject to the limitation"
"contained in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance cannot be affected due to Section 192 of Civil"
"Procedure Code which creates a supplementary right to interest safeguards the judgment creditor"
"due to time that may consume in litigation. However, above supports the view that if any interest"
"is legally due that should not be limited or curtailed due to aforesaid section 192. Thus, it means,"
"if a right of a party is not subject to the limitation in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance, and if"
"the said party is entitled to a higher interest as agreed by an agreement or due to customs or trade"
"practices, it shall not be curtailed by aforesaid Section 192."
"I
n Nimalaratne Perera V People’s Bank (2005) 1 Sri L R 67, it was held that the limitation in"
"Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance on the amount recoverable as interest has no application to"
"interest recoverable in banking transactions."
"I
t is not in dispute that the dispute involved in the matter at hand is based on a banking transaction."
