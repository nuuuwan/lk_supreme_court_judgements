In terms of the Intellectual Property Act, any transfer, any assignment or licence relating to economic rights has to be in writing, signed by the transferor and the transferee, assignor and the assignee or licensor and the licensee as the case may be- vide section 16(2) of the Act. Even though there is a clear transfer of rights to the Defendants subject to certain conditions according to the above quoted paragraph, no document made after entering into \u2018Pe1\u2019 that confers such rights to the Government directly by the Plaintiffs or by the Defendants as per the consent for such purpose included in the above quoted paragraph has been marked in evidence. It must be noted no one has placed his signature on \u2018Pe1\u2019 on behalf of the Government. Thus, there is no acceptable proof of transfer of rights to the Government as per the consent expressed in the quoted paragraph above. Mere laymen\u2019s view expressed while giving evidence that may suggest that the economic rights are with the Government will not prove such rights are now vested with the Government when such transfer has to be done in writing in terms of section 16(2). Things contained in a document has to be proved by tendering the document. On the other hand, even if it is assumed that the Defendants transferred such rights to the Government in writing after acquiring such rights through \u2018Pe1\u2019 or that the rights so acquired by the Defendants were transferred to the Government due to the effect of the agreement the Defendant had with the Government after accepting their bid in terms of the bid documents marked \u2018Pe5\u2019, the Government cannot have a better ownership of economic rights than what the Defendants obtained through \u2018Pe1\u2019.

It is the responsibility of the Defendants to take necessary steps to claim or obtain necessary payments from the Educational Publications Department as per any agreement they had with the Government. As per the bid documents marked \u2018Pe5\u2019, it was the responsibility of the Defendants to include the amounts to be paid as royalties in the Total Bid Price. When entering into \u2018Pe1\u2019 with the Plaintiffs, instead of agreeing to a one-time payment, the Defendants have agreed to pay royalties even when the work is reprinted. Thus, the Defendants should have included necessary amounts in the Total Bid Price when they have the right to re-supply for two years as per the bid documents. It is the Defendants who have agreed to pay what the parties termed as royalties even when a reprint is done. There is no dispute that the royalties were paid for the 1st print done for 2007. If the said condition was not there, the Plaintiffs would not have considered the transferring of economic rights to enable the Defendants or the Educational Publications Department to reprint the work. It is the Defendants through the 3rd Defendant entered into the agreement marked \u2018Pe1\u2019. The dispute is with regards to the 2nd Print for 2008 for which the royalties as agreed were not paid. As per the said agreement, the Defendants are liable to pay as agreed for any reprint they do. There is no contractual nexus between the Educational Publications Department and the Plaintiffs to sue the said Department based on the obligations created through \u2018Pe1\u2019.

    "text": "The Defendants in their further written submissions have indicated that it is only the owner of a copyright who is entitled to license a copyrighted work can claim royalties if the reproduction of the work was licensed. In relation to the above stance, the Defendants have cited from law books and many case laws including \u201cCopinger and Skone James on Copyright\u201d by Garnet, Davis & Harbottle, 16th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell India 2011 at pp 348-350, JHP Limited V BBC Worldwide Limited [2007] EWHC 751etc. It seems that the Defendants state so to indicate that it is only the person or entity that has economic rights can claim the royalties and the Plaintiffs are now devoid of its economic rights as it has assigned them to the Educational Publications Department. However, the position stated in the answer as well as the previous written submissions filed by the Defendants dated 13th January 2020 appears to be that the Plaintiffs transferred the economic rights to the Educational Publications Department via 2nd Defendant Appellant Company. Again, in their written submissions, in reply to a stance taken by the Plaintiff Respondents, the Defendants attempt to indicate that as per section 14(4) of the Act, the Plaintiffs have not reserved any economic rights in their favour and the Government is the full owner of the economic rights. Whatever the position is, as said before the transfer of economic rights in writing in terms of section 16(2) to the Educational Publications Department, where the Assignor and Assignee have signed, has not been placed in evidence; Even it is assumed that the economic rights which the Defendants got through \u2018Pe1\u2019 was transferred to the Educational Publications Department, what the Defendants acquired through \u2018Pe1\u2019 was subject to the condition of paying the amount as agreed for the reprints. The transfer of economic rights through \u2018Pe1\u2019 to the Defendants or the agreement to transfer economic rights to the Educational Publications Department contained in the agreement marked \u2018Pe1\u2019 was subject to certain conditions and the said condition to pay when the reprint is done contains part of consideration which the Defendants are obliged to pay when the reprints are done. Thus, I do not see any relevance of what is quoted from case laws or from law books as the issue involved in this matter depends on what has been agreed by the parties through \u2018Pe1\u2019.",
