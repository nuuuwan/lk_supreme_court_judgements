"Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription, the burden of proof"
"rests  fairly  and  squarely  on  him  to  establish  a  starting  point  for  his  or  her  acquisition  of"
"prescriptive rights [Chelliah v. Wijenathan et al (54 N.L.R. 337)]."
"The  Petitioner  claimed  that  he  was  in  possession  of  the  corpus  from  1972.  The  corpus  is"
"situated North of Lot 6 depicted in P. Plan No. 2995 containing 15 perches in extent claimed"
"by the son of the Petitioner. In fact, this claim was upheld and compensation paid for the said"
"portion of land to the son. Nevertheless, the corpus claimed by the Petitioner is not shown to"
"the North of the said land in the Plan No. 93 made by licensed surveyor M.J. Setunga dated"
"19.9.1971."
"In the Deed of Declaration No. 11966 attested on 26.08.2007, the Petitioner claims to have"
"constructed a corrugated sheets thatched small hut on the corpus in 1973. This claim if proved"
"can certainly be taken in favour of the prescriptive title of the Petitioner. However, Plan No."
"3462  made  by  licensed  surveyor  B.P.  Gangodawila  dated  26.05.1980  does  not  show  any"
"construction on the corpus."
"In order to establish his prescriptive title, the Petitioner claimed that he had paid assessment"
"rates for the corpus. Nevertheless, the payment receipts tendered in evidence prove only that"
"such rates have been paid from 1995 onwards. The corpus was acquired by the State in 1999."
"Moreover, the Deed of Declaration No. 11966 was prepared seven years after the corpus was"
"acquired by the State. The claim of the Petitioner was made only thereafter. The Petitioner"
"has failed to establish his claim of prescriptive title by cogent evidence."
"For all the foregoing reasons, I answer all three questions of law in the negative."
"Appeal dismissed. Parties shall bear their costs."
