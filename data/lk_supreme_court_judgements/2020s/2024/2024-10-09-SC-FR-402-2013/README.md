Argued on: 01.07.2024

Decided on: 09.10.2024

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this fundamental rights application against the 1st

respondent, the Commissioner General of Excise, and the 2nd to the 10th

respondents, the Chairman and the Members of the Public Service

Commission, seeking a declaration that his fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by

the decision contained in the document marked P22.

According to P5, the petitioner was promoted to the rank of Excise

Sergeant Major, effective from 01.06.2000. Clause 10 of P5 required the

petitioner to pass the Efficiency Bar examination before reaching the

salary step of Rs. 69,120. However, P5 did not specify a deadline for

passing the examination. As evidenced by P7, the petitioner had already

been placed in the salary step of Rs. 70,680 prior to his promotion to

Excise Sergeant Major. Therefore, Clause 10 of P5, which stipulated that

the petitioner must pass the Efficiency Bar examination before reaching

the salary step of Rs. 69,120, is meaningless.

The petitioner did not receive his salary increments for the rank of Excise

Sergeant Major for the years 2001 and 2002. Upon inquiry, he was

3

SC/FR/402/2013

informed that this was due to his failure to sit for the Efficiency Bar

examination. By letter dated 17.12.2002 marked R3, the petitioner was

notified that if he successfully sat for the Efficiency Bar examination

within three years from his appointment to the rank of Excise Sergeant

Major, he would be granted all the salary increments. His three-year

period was to expire on 01.06.2003. It appears that no Efficiency Bar

examination was held between 17.12.2002 and 01.06.2003. According to

the objections and the written submissions filed by the respondents,

dring the relevant period, the Efficiency Bar examinations were held on

06.04.2001, 12.09.2002, 18.09.2003 and 04.11.2004. The petitioner sat

for the examination held on 18.09.2003 (with the viva voce reportedly

conducted on 02.10.2003, as evidenced by P8), but did not pass. He

subsequently passed the Efficiency Bar examination held on 04.11.2004

and was granted all the salary increments for the years 2001 to 2005.

While holding the rank of Excise Sergeant Major, by notice marked P12,

applications were called for the post of Excise Inspector. The

qualifications were:

(a) Must be an Excise Sergeant Major in service or an Excise Sergeant

with not less than two years of satisfactory service in the said rank.

(b) Excise Sergeants must have been awarded at least the Red 1 badge

for satisfactory service.

(c) Must have obtained all salary increments during the preceding five

years ( 05

).

(d) Must not be subject to any disciplinary action during the preceding

five years except being issued a warning or reprimand.

When the petitioner applied for the post of Excise Inspector in 2006, he

had admittedly earned all the salary increments for the preceding five

years.

SC/FR/402/2013

Since the petitioner met all the required qualifications, he applied for the

post, sat for the limited competitive examination, and attended the

interview. He successfully passed all stages. Consequently, by letter

marked P13, he, along with 38 other officers, was appointed to cover

duties in the rank of Excise Inspector effective from 01.01.2007. The

petitioner, inter alia, underwent a training program, was issued a new

identity card, and had his salary converted to the post of Excise

Inspector. He was subsequently served with a formal letter of promotion

to the post of Excise Inspector effective from 12.10.2006 issued by the

Public Service Commission (as evidenced by P18A and P18B). He was

later confirmed in the rank of Excise Inspector effective from 12.10.2006

by letter P19.

While discharging his duties as an Excise Inspector since 2006, the

petitioner received letter P22 dated 19.11.2013. This letter, sent by the

Commissioner General of Excise, informed the petitioner of a decision

made by the Public Service Commission, arising out of a complaint lodged

by another Excise Sergeant Major with the Human Rights Commission.

P22, which speaks for itself, reads as follows:

The letter from the Public Service Commission dated 25.10.2013, referred

to in paragraph 4 of P22, was produced marked R7. This letter was

neither addressed to nor copied to the petitioner. It was addressed to the

Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and contained the following decisions

made by the Public Service Commission.

Section 15 of Chapter II of the Establishments Code, inter alia, states that

if an officer does not pass the Efficiency Bar examination during the

extension allowed, the increment that falls due after the expiry of that

extension will be deferred by a period of time equal to the time in excess of

the extension allowed to pass the Efficiency Bar Examination.

The petitioner was appointed to the post of Excise Inspector by the Public

Service Commission with effect from 12.10.2006. He has served in that

rank continuously until he unexpectedly received the letter marked P22.

The petitioner was not given an opportunity to be heard prior to the

decision in P22, either by the Commissioner General of Excise or by the

Public Service Commission. Moreover, the decision was not

communicated to the petitioner by the Public Service Commissionthe

decision maker and the appointing authority. The petitioner had a

legitimate expectation of retiring as an Excise Inspector. The rules of

natural justice have been blatantly violated. The requirement stated in

P5 was 05

, and there is no dispute that the petitioner had

earned all the increments within five years preceding the date of his

application for the post of Excise Inspector. The petitioner neither acted

mala fide nor misled the officials.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the respondents informed

this Court that despite the decision in P22, the petitioners promotion to

the post of Excise Inspector has not been cancelled to date, and the

petitioner retired from service as an Excise Inspector.

SC/FR/402/2013

I hold that the decision contained in P22 is arbitrary and manifestly

unreasonable and in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The

decision contained in P22 is quashed and the petitioners application is

allowed. Taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I make no

order as to costs.
