"Moreover, there are patent inconsistencies in the Appellant’s version which poses questions about his"
"credibility.  As  already  referred  to  in  the  evidence  given  by  the  Appellant  under  cross-examination"
"when Police officers asked him to show where one ‘chutti’ was, the Appellant took the position that"
"he  could  not  show  where  chutti  was  as  he  did  not  know.  However,  the  Appellant  admitted  having"
"known  where  Chutti  lives  in  detail.  The  defence  taken  by  the  Appellant  is  solely  supported  by  the"
"Appellant’s wife."
"In  AG  vs  Sanadanam  Pitchy  Mary  Theresa 10  Shiranee  Thilakwardene 
J.  commenting  on 
the"
"credibility of a witness stated as follows;"
"A  key  test  of  credibility 
is  whether  the  witness 
is  an 
interested  or  disinterested  witness."
"Rajaratnam J. in Tudor Perera v. AG (SC 23/75 D.C. Colombo Bribery 190/B  – Minutes of S.C."
"Dated 1/11/1975) observed that when considering the evidence of an interested witness who"
"may  desire  to  conceal  the  truth,  such  evidence  must  be  scrutinized  with  some  care.  The"
"independent  witness  will  normally  be  referred  to  an  interested  witness  in  case  of  conflict."
"Matters  of  motive,  prejudice,  partiality,  accuracy, 
incentive,  and  reliability  have  all  to  be"
"weighed (Vide, Halsbury Laws of England 4th Edition para 29)."
"Considering  the  ulterior  motives  that  could  have  an  influence  on  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant’s"
"witness  owing  to  the  close  relationship  between  the  Appellant’s  witness  and  the  Appellant, 
it"
"seriously  casts  doubt  upon  the  probability  of  her  version  being  true  against  the 
independent"
"evidence  presented  to  the  court  by  prosecution  witnesses,  who  were  official  witnesses  with  no"
"possible personal interest in the arrest of the Appellant."
