"However,  Justice  Sisira  De  Abrew  in  Brian  Anthony  Samuel  and  Others  vs  AG,6  despite  the  error"
"done by the trial judge in pursuing the Information Book and deciding on the issue, contended that,"
"When I consider the evidence led at the trial I hold the  view that the above misdirection has"
"not occasioned a miscarriage of justice. I, therefore, decide to act on the proviso to section 334"
"of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  which  reads  as  follows:  ""Provided  that  the  court  may,"
"notwithstanding  that  it  is  of  opinion  that  the  point  raised  in  the  appeal might  be  decided  in"
"favour  of  the  appellant,  dismiss  the  appeal  if  it  considers  that  no  substantial  miscarriage  of"
"justice has actually occurred."
