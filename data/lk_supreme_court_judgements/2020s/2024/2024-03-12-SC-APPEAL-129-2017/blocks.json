It could be said that the analyst receipt that PW5 received from the Analyst department which has already been submitted to the court itself could be admitted as a piece of primary evidence under sec 62 of the Evidence Ordinance that is sufficient to establish the chain of production even without having to call Ms. C.P. Kumarapedi as a witness.
