"58. In  this  regard,  the","learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  has  observed  that  the"
"","employment of an employee cannot be terminated merely because the employer"
"","has made allegations against him. Such allegations must be proved with evidence."
"","He  has  also  expressed  the  view  that  in  the  instant  case,  there  is  no  sufficient"
"","evidence to have satisfied the Tribunal that the acts of the Respondent had led to"
"","a  breach  of  confidence.  Learned  Judge  has  further  opined  that  the  evidence"
"","adduced by the Appellant against the Respondent does not establish any financial"
"","misappropriation and that in the circumstances, he has held that the instant matter"
"","is  not  one  where  loss  of  confidence  had  genuinely  occurred  and  therefore,  the"
"","Order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal to reinstate the Respondent"
"","with back wages was correct. That is because, the learned President of the Labour"
"","Tribunal  had  not  been  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  bank  had  genuinely  lost"
"","confidence  in  the  Respondent.  As  held  by  Justice  Amerasinghe  in  Premadasa"
"","Rodrigo v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation [(1991) 2 Sri.LR 382], “loss of confidence"
"","must be based on established grounds of misconduct which the law regards as sufficient”."
"","His Lordship has agreed with the submission made by counsel in that case, that"
"","“…an employer cannot claim to have a right to  dismiss an employee merely because he"
"","says he has lost confidence”. The test for loss of confidence as submitted by learned"
"","counsel for the Appellant, being reasonable suspicion is applicable only where the"
"","misconduct of the employee  is criminal in nature  and involves moral turpitude"
"","such as the involvement of the employee in a fraudulent transaction. There is no"
"","such allegation against the Respondent in this matter. Therefore, I agree with the"
"","findings of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned Judge of"
"the High Court.",""
