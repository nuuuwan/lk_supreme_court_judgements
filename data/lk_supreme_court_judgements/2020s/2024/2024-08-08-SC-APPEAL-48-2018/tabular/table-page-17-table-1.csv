"Respondent himself. The learned President has observed that the testimony of this"
"witness is uncertain and unsure. Although the documents “R16”, “R17” and “R18”"
"have been produced subject to proof, those documents have not been proved and"
"therefore, have not been considered. Therefore, there being no evidence as to the"
"arrival of the Respondent at the office of the Pronto courier service, and by witness"
"Hennayake  admitting  that  he  cannot  certainly  state  that  it  was  the  Respondent"

"Tribunal has arrived at the finding that the Appellant has not proved that charge"
"on  a  balance  of  probabilities.  Therefore,  the  learned  President  of  the  Labour"
"Tribunal has considered evidence of both parties when arriving at that finding."
