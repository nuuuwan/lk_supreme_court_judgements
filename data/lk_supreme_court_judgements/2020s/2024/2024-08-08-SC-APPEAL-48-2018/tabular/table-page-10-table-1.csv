"18. In The Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber Estates Ltd v J. S. Hillman [79 (1) NLR"
"421], the Court has held the following view:"
"“Under Section 31D (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, an appeal to the Supreme"
"Court lies from an order of a Labour Tribunal only on a question of law. Parties"
"are bound by the Tribunal’s findings of fact, unless it could be said that the"
"said findings are perverse and not supported by any evidence. With regard"
"to cases where an appeal is provided on questions of law only, Lord Normand in"
"Inland Revenue v Fraser [(1942) 24 Tax Cases p. 498], spelt the powers of Court"
"as follows:"
"‘In cases where it is competent for a Tribunal to make findings of fact which are"
"excluded from review, the Appeal Court has always jurisdiction to intervene"
"if it appears …that the Tribunal has made a finding for which there is no"
"evidence, or which is inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of"
"it.’"
