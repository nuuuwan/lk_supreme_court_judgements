"I
n  this  framework,  the  question  of  assessment  of  evidence  is  within  the"
"province of the Tribunal, and, if there is evidence on record to support its"
"findings, this Court cannot review those findings even though on its own"
"perception of the evidence this Court may be inclined to come to a different"
"conclusion. ‘If the case contains anything ex facie which is bad in law and which"
"bears  upon  its  determination,  it  is,  obviously,  erroneous  in  point  of  law.  But,"
"without any misconception appearing ex facie, it may be that the facts found are"
"such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law"
"could have come to the determination under appeal. In those circumstances too, the"
"Court must intervene.’ – … Thus, in order to set aside a determination of facts by"
"the Tribunal, limited as this Court is only to setting aside a determination which is"
"erroneous in  law, the appellant  must satisfy  this Court  that there was no"
"legal evidence to support the conclusion of facts reached by the Tribunal,"
"or that the finding is not rationally possible and is perverse having regard"
"to the evidence on record. Hence, a heavy burden is rested on the appellant"
"when he invited this Court to reverse the conclusion of facts arrived at by"
"the Tribunal.” [Emphasis added]"
"[The  reference  in  this  judgment  to  the  ‘Supreme  Court’  should  now  be"
"understood as being a reference to the High Court of the Provinces.]"
