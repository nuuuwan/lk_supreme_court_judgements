"contrary to what was installed by the Respondent. This was despite the availability"
"of opportunity they had to do so at regular meetings of the Appellant bank and at"
"site visits. Learned counsel contended that the Respondent has, in compliance with"
"written  and  verbal  instructions  of  the  superiors,  and  in  accordance  with  the"
"procedures of the Appellant bank, carried out his duties diligently and honestly."
"In conclusion, learned counsel submitted that the termination of employment of"
"the Respondent by the Appellant bank had caused enormous and irreparable loss"
"and damage to the Respondent, and therefore pleaded that this Court dismisses"
"the instant Appeal and order that a significant amount of compensation be paid to"
"the Respondent."
