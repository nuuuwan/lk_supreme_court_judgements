"of  the  Labour  Tribunal,  and  (ii)  in  determining  whether  its  analysis  should"
"culminate in reversing the findings of fact reached by a Labour Tribunal."
"21. I shall now advert to the questions of law on which special leave to appeal has been"
"granted by this Court and answer them."
"(i) Did the High Court err in law in failing to consider and evaluate the submission"
"made  by  the  Petitioner  that  the  Labour  Tribunal  had  failed  to  appreciate  the"
"evidence  that  the  Respondent  had  installed  air-conditioners  in  excess  of  the"
"capacity, thereby causing loss to the Petitioner?"
"22. This is a question of law which relates to the appreciation of evidence and findings"
"of fact. Therefore, as I have held above, the role of this Court as an appellate court"
"is not to analyse the evidence and arrive at its own finding as regards the facts of"
"the case. It is to consider whether the learned President of the Labour Tribunal has"
"correctly appreciated the evidence of the Respondent, that the air conditioners that"
"were installed were in excess of the capacity, thereby causing loss to the Appellant"
"bank, and whether the learned Judge of the High Court has considered whether"
"the learned President of the Labour Tribunal has correctly evaluated the evidence"
"in arriving at the respective finding."
"23. This  question  of  law  relates  to  charge  1  (installation  of  air  conditioners  at  the"
"Maharagama branch) and charge 4 (installation of air conditioners at the Vavuniya"
"branch)."
"F
indings of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High Court"
"Judge as regards charges relating to the Maharagama branch"
"24. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal has observed that although witness"
"Hewapathirana constantly stated that the Respondent had not obtained approval"
"to purchase the necessary air conditioners, as amended by “R2”, there has been no"
"charge  against  the  Respondent  that  he  had  not  obtained  approval.  He  has"
"observed that contrary to what was stated by Hewapathirana in the memorandum"
"marked “R4”, that the Respondent has assessed a capacity that is in excess of the"
"required capacity, witness Hennayake has stated in evidence that the Appellant"
"proceeded to make payment for the air conditioners referred to in “R2” with the"
"knowledge of the precise cost to be incurred for the machinery contained in “R2”."
"The  learned  President  has  therefore  arrived  at  the  finding  that  such  procedure"
"followed by the Respondent is not incorrect."
