"Findings of fact which do not harmonise with the evidence underlying them lack all"
"claims to validity, whatever be the Tribunal which makes them."
"Proper findings of fact are a necessary basis for the exercise by the Labour Tribunals"
"of that wide jurisdiction given to them by statute of making such orders as they"
"consider to be just and equitable. Where there is no such proper finding of fact, the"
"order that ensues would not be the one which is just and equitable upon the evidence"
"placed  before  the  Tribunal,  for  justice  and  equity  cannot  be  administered  in  a"
"particular  case  apart  from  its  own  particular  facts.  I  am  strengthened  in  the"
"conclusion I have formed by a perusal of the judgment already referred to, of by my"
"brother Tennekoon [Ceylon Transport Board v Ceylon Transport Workers’ Unions"
"(1968) 71 NLR 158], who has observed that it is only after the ascertainment of the"
"facts upon a judicial approach to the evidence, that a Labour Tribunal can pass on"
"to the next stage of making an order that is fair and equitable having regard to the"
"facts so found.”"
