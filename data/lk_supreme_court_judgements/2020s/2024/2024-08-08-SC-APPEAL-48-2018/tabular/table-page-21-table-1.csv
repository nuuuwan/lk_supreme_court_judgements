"held the following view:"
"“It seems to me that loss of confidence has two aspects in Labour Law: (1) where"
"the termination of employment is effected by the employer on the ground of loss of"
"confidence, (2) Loss of confidence may be a circumstance from which a Court may"
"conclude that reinstatement is not the appropriate relief, despite a finding that the"
"termination is not justified. “"
