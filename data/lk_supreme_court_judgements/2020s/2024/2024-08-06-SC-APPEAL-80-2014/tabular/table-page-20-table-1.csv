"For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Appellant has failed to prove the title to"
"unallotted lot No. 6."
"In  summary,  the  Respondent  has  failed  to  establish  her  prescriptive  rights  to  the"
"unallotted lot No. 6.  The Appellant has failed to prove the pedigree to the unallotted"
"lot No. 6."
"The judgment of the High Court dated 19.02.2013 is partly amended to that extent."
"Appeal is partly allowed."
