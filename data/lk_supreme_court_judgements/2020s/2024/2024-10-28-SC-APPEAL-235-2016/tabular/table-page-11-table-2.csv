"intervention by the Privy Council or via legislative enactment. Bonser C.J."
"stated at page 264:"
"If it were necessary to express an opinion on this point, I should be"
"content to adopt the view of my brother Withers, whose knowledge"
"of Roman-Dutch Law is so much greater than mine. But in my opinion"
"this question is not open; even if the Court as at present constituted"
"was unanimously of opinion that the original decision was wrong, it"
"would, I conceive, be out of our power to alter the law as laid down"
"by  our  predecessors.  That  can  only  be  done  by  the  Privy  Council"
"reversing  those  decisions,  or  by  an  enactment  of  the  Legislative"
"Council."
