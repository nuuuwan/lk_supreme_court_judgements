"The proceedings of 16.01.1963 in case No. LN 6699, spanning five pages,"
"were marked as P8 at the trial. It is impractical to reproduce the entire"
"proceedings  here.  However,  upon 
reviewing 
those  proceedings, 
it"
"becomes clear that the plaintiff had obtained an ex parte enjoining order"
"restraining the defendants from appropriating produce and constructing"
"on the land pending the said action. Upon service of the enjoining order,"
"the defendants’ counsel raised several technical objections, as noted in"
"the proceedings. It was in this context that the aforementioned settlement"
"was recorded, which reads as follows: “At this stage it is agreed that the"
"2nd defendant will pluck all the nuts from the land in this case, appropriate"
"the  produce  and  build,  if  he  so  desires,  all  at  his  risk.”  After  this  was"
"recorded, as per P8, the enjoining order was discharged."
"Learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that this conduct reflects that"
"of an individual of subordinate character agreeing to a settlement in fear"
"of  a  full-blown  interim  injunction  that  might  be  granted  against  him."
"When perusing the proceedings, I am unable to accept this submission."
"The settlement  appears to have been suggested by the plaintiff, not by"
"the defendants, in view of a potential refusal of the interim injunction in"
"toto.  This  is  what  the  plaintiff  stated  in  his  evidence  in  chief  while"
"marking  P8: 
“මෙෙ  නඩුමේ  විත්තිකරුවන්  භුක්තිමේ  සිටින්මන්  බලහත්තකාරමෙන්"
"ඇිකරගන්නා ලද පදිංචිෙක්ත ෙත. ඊට  පසුව එල් එල් 6699 දරන නඩුමේදී තහනම් නිමෙෝගෙ"
"සම්බන්ධමෙන් සෙතෙක්ත ඇිවුනා. ඒ සෙතෙ නම් තහනම් නිමෙෝගෙ සෙග දේරුම් ප්‍රකාශෙක්ත"
"ඉදරිපත්ත මනාකිරීෙ නිසා එතනදී සෙතෙකට පැමිණ ිමබනවා.”"
"As  I  stated  previously,  the  plaintiff’s  position  was  that  the  defendants"
"have been in forcible possession since 16.01.1963. In this backdrop, the"
"plaintiff stated that the 2nd defendant (the 1st  defendant in the  present"
"action)  may  enjoy  the  property,  at  his  own  risk.  That  is,  should  the"
"plaintiff succeed, the 2nd defendant would be liable for the repayment of"
"appropriated  produce  and  would  receive  no  compensation 
for  any"
