"prescription. While setting aside the judgment on that point, Maartensz"
"J. (with whom Abrahams C.J concurred) observed at page 27:"
"[A]  successful  action  for  declaration  of  title  is  an  interruption  of"
"possession.  The decree forces upon the person against whom it is"
"entered an acknowledgment of title, and if that person continues in"
"possession the possession can only be calculated for the purposes"
"of prescription, from the date of the decree.  To hold otherwise would"
"mean that a person who has had adverse possession for say seven"
"years may claim a title by prescriptive possession if he continues in"
"adverse possession for three years after the decree.  A proposition"
"which stands self condemned."
