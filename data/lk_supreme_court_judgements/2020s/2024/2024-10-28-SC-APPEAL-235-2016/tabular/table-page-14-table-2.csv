"broken; the result of the finding of the Court is to restore the seisin"
"of the plaintiff."
"The above dictum was quoted with approval by Wigneswaran J. in Perera"
"v. Fernando [1999] 3 Sri LR 259 at 263."
"The  argument  of  learned  counsel  for  the  plaintiff  that  Unambuwe  v."
"Janohamy is wrongly decided cannot be accepted. The institution of an"
"action ipso facto does not interrupt prescription but only suspends it. At"
"the end, if the plaintiff succeeds, the defendant’s possession is deemed"
"to have been interrupted from the date of filing the action. If the plaintiff"
"fails, the defendant’s possession remains uninterrupted."
"Conclusion"
"The  second  question  of  law  on  which  leave  to  appeal  was  granted  is"
"answered in the affirmative, and the judgments of the District Court and"
"the High Court of Civil Appeal are set aside. The plaintiff’s action shall"
"stand dismissed as the original 1st defendant has acquired prescriptive"
"title to the land. The appeal is allowed but without costs."
