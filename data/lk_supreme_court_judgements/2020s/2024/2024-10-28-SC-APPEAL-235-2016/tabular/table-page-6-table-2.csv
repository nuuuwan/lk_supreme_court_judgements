"In  Silva  v.  De  Zoysa  (1931)  32  NLR  199  at  201-202,  Macdonell  C.J."
"eloquently explained this requirement as follows:"
"To answer this question [whether an inference of acknowledgment"
"of right in another can be drawn] it is necessary to take all the facts"
"relevant thereto. The section No. 3 of Ordinance 22 of 1871 speaks"
"of  an  “act…from  which  the  acknowledgment  of  a  right  existing"
"another person would fairly and naturally be inferred”, so we must"
"ascertain what the “act” was before we can say whether or not a"
"certain  inference  “fairly  and  naturally”  arises  from  it,  which  is"
"simply  another  way  of  saying  that  we  must  know  and  take  into"
"account all the component parts of that “act”, for if we do not, if we"
"simply take one isolated fact apart from its surroundings, we would"
"not be giving weight to those words in the section which say that the"
"inference  of  acknowledgment  of  right  in  another  must  be  one  that"
"arises “fairly and naturally”."
