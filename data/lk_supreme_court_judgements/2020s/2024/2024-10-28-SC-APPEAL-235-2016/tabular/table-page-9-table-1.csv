"In my view, both the District Court and the High Court failed to interpret"
"the purported settlement from the correct perspective and thereby came"
"to a wrong conclusion."
"Does  the  institution  of  an  action  constitute  an  interruption  of"
"possession?"
"Proof 
of 
uninterrupted 
possession 
for 
ten 
years 
preceding 
the"
"commencement  of  the  action 
is  another  requirement  that  must  be"
"satisfied by the party claiming prescriptive title. On this premise, learned"
"counsel for the plaintiff raised an additional question of law during the"
"course of the argument. He contended that the institution of an action"

"dismissed on a technical objection (failure to file the certificate of non-"
"settlement 
together  with 
the  plaint)  on  18.09.1973.  As  previously"
"mentioned, the instant action was filed on 27.06.1974. Accordingly, the"
"argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff was that the 1st defendant"
"did not possess the land for the requisite ten-year period prior to bringing"
"the action to claim prescriptive title."
"The  old  law  based  on  Roman  Dutch  law  was  that  the institution  of  an"
