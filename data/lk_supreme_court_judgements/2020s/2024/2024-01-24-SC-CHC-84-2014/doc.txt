The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) instituted this action in the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province (Exercising Civil Jurisdiction) Holden in Colombo

(Commercial High Court) seeking an order to wind up the Respondent-Respondent

(Respondent).

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court dismissed the application with costs.

Aggrieved by the dismissal, the Appellant has preferred this appeal.

The Appellant has also filed a leave to appeal application bearing No.

SC/HC/LA/46/2014. Parties agreed that they will abide by one judgment given in S.C.

Appeal (CHC) No. 84/2014 which is the statutory appeal.

Page 3 of 10

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court dismissed the application to wind up

on the following grounds:

1. The Appellant has failed to submit any documents to corroborate the matters

pleaded in the petition seeking the winding up of the Respondent.

2. The Appellant has failed to exhaust alternative remedies prior to the institution

of this application.

3. It is not just and equitable to wind up the Respondent Company since the

Appellant has not exhausted alternative remedies.

Ground for Winding Up

The winding up application was made pursuant to Section 270 (f) of the Companies Act

No. 07 of 2007 (Act) which reads:

270. A company may be wound up by the court, if-

(f) the Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the

Company should be wound up

The Appellant sought a winding up order on the basis that there is a deadlock in the

Respondent Company and/or in the management of the said Company and/or the

ownership of the said Company.

In Ceylon Textiles Ltd. v. Chittampalam Gardiner (54 N.L.R. 313) it was held that the

words "a company may be wound up by the court if the court is of the opinion that it is

just and equitable that the company should be wound up" in Section 162 (6) of the

Companies Ordinance No. 51 of 1938 is extremely wide and includes a situation where

there is a deadlock. However, L. M. D. De Silva J. added a word of caution in stating (at

page 316):

In the decided cases the deadlock has been complete. In fact no deadlock can

truly be called a deadlock unless it is complete but the word "complete" serves

to direct attention to the true nature of the deadlock that must be shown to exist

Page 4 of 10

before a liquidation can be ordered. It must be complete not only at any given

moment but it must appear reasonably that no remedy can be hoped for by

recourse to the courts or otherwise.

It is an established rule of interpretation that where there are statutes made in pari

materia, whatever has been determined in the construction of one of them is a sound

rule of construction for the other [Craies on Statute Law, 7th Ed., page 139]. In Crosley

v. Arkwright [(1788) 2 T.R. 603, 608, (1788) 100 E.R. 325, 328] Buller J. held that all

Acts relating to one subject must be construed in pari materia.

The Companies Ordinance No. 51 of 1938 and the Act are in pari materia. The

interpretation given to just and equitable in the former is applicable to the Act as well.

Hence, the ground relied on by the Appellant is one which falls within Section 270 (f)

of the Act.

Burden of Proof

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court took the view that the Appellant has

failed to submit any documents to corroborate the matters pleaded in the petition

seeking the winding up of the Respondent Company. Court refers to the denial by Mrs.

Anula Fernando of the matters pleaded in the winding up petition and states that it is

word and against word and hence no reason to accept one version over the other.

Accordingly, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court holds that the Appellant

has failed to prove the allegations made in the winding up application.

One important matter pleaded by the Appellant is that she holds 50% of the shares of

the Respondent Company and is also a Director. It is true that the Appellant has not

tendered any documentation to establish that she is a shareholder and a Director.

Nevertheless, this pales into insignificance upon a consideration of the affidavit filed

by Mrs. Anula Fernando opposing the winding up application. She has, at paragraph 32

of her affidavit, admitted that the Appellant and she are the only shareholders and

Directors of the Respondent Company. In this context the requirement of any

documentation to corroborate these two matters does not arise.

Page 5 of 10

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court erred in overlooking the admissions

made in the affidavit filed in opposition to the winding up application while taking

cognizance only of the denials made therein.

Another important matter pleaded by the Appellant is that Mrs. Anula Fernando has

constantly failed and neglected to have any board meetings, divulge any accounts,

have any shareholders meetings, furnish audited accounts, have a general meeting or

furnish information in respect of the running of the company. Admittedly, the

Appellant has not tendered any documentation in support of these allegations.

However, she has affirmed to such matters in her affidavit.

Nevertheless, as the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court himself states,

requiring such evidence from the Appellant amounts to asking her to prove the

negative. In Laxmibai (Dead) Thru Lr'S. & Anr vs Bhagwanthbuva (Dead) Thru Lr'S. &

Ors. [Civil Appeal No. 2058 of 2003, Decided on 29.01.2013] the Indian Supreme held

(at para. 15) that a negative fact cannot be proved by adducing positive evidence.

Nanda Senanayake in Legal Maxims & Phrases, First Ed. (2023), page 435 states that a

negative is usually incapable of proof. The decision in New Indian Assurance Company

Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadiya and Another [Case No. Appeal (Civil) 5879 of 2007,

Decided on 13.12.2007] is cited in support. There, the Supreme Court of India referred

(at para. 54) to the legal maxim, ei incumbit probation qui dicit, non qui negat (The

burden of proving a fact rest on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of

the issue and not upon the party who denies it; for a negative is usually incapable of

proof).

In New Indian Assurance Company Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadiya and Another (ibid.) it

was held that it is an ancient rule founded on consideration of good sense and should

not be departed from without strong reasons, and reference was made to the

statement by Lord Maugham in Constantine (Joseph) Steamship Line Ltd. vs. Imperial

Smelting Corpn. [(1941) 2 All ER 165, 179]. This rule is derived from Roman law and is

Page 6 of 10

supportable not only upon the ground of fairness, but also upon that of the greater

practical difficulty which is involved in proving a negative than in proving an affirmative.

This Court has affirmed this legal maxim in Indrajith Rodrigo v. Central Engineering

Consultancy Bureau [(2009) 1 Sri.L.R. 248].

This legal maxim has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of India in Shambhu Nath

Goyal vs. Bank of Baroda and others (1983) 4 SCC 491, Garden Silk Mills Ltd. and

another vs. Union of India and others (1999) 8 SCC 744 and J. K. Synthetics Ltd. vs. K.

P. Agrawal and another (2007) 2 SCC 433 (para 18).

The learned Counsel for the Respondent relied on the decision in In Re Langham

Skating Rink Company [(1877) 5 Ch.D. 669] where it was held that it is very important

that Court should not, unless a very strong case is made, take upon itself to interfere

with the domestic forum which has been established for the management of a

company.

The decisions in McInerney Homes Ltd. v. Cos Acts 1990 [(2011) IESC 31] and Re

Connemara Mining Company PLC (No. 2) [(2013) IEHC 225] were also cited where the

High Court of Ireland refused to wind up a company on the grounds that the Petitioner

had failed to discharge the onus of proving, that it would be just and equitable to wind

up the company.

I am mindful of the provisions in Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance which reads:

101. Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or

liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove

that those facts exist.

It is the Appellant who is seeking to wind up the Respondent Company. This is sought

to be done due to the alleged failure and neglect to have any board meetings, divulge

any accounts, have any shareholders meetings, furnish audited accounts, have a

general meeting or furnish information in respect of the running of the Respondent

Company. These matters have been affirmed to by the Appellant in her affidavit. That

Page 7 of 10

is evidence for the purposes of the winding up application and should have been

considered by the Commercial High Court.

Moreover, Mrs. Anula Fernando has, at paragraphs 8 and 19 of her affidavit, denied

the allegation on the failure to hold board meetings and the failure to divulge any

accounts. She has reserved her right to tender the relevant documents to Court.

In this context, it is apposite to consider the practice of English Courts in winding up

applications. In Re Travel and Holiday Clubs Ltd. [(1967) 2 All.E.R. 606], on the

question of whether the evidence filed (by way of affidavit) was not sufficient to

support the charges contained in the petition, it was held (at pages 608-609) that:

"The court would not in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction, be satisfied

with prima facie evidence but would require the petitioner to substantiate his

case more fully; that in such cases it would require, where practicable, the

evidence of witnesses with direct knowledge of the matters to which they were

testifying, and on which they could be cross-examined, and which conformed to

the ordinary rules of the admissibility of evidence".

In Colombo Engineering Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd. and Others v. Hatton National Bank

Ltd. [(1999) 1 Sri.L.R. 72 at 75] the Court of Appeal after an examination of the English

practice held:

Whilst no doubt the verifying affidavit is always a necessary document, in all

cases it may not always be sufficient to verify the petition. In such cases the

Judge clearly has a discretion to allow the testimony of witnesses and their

cross-examination. It may appear to be contradictory to the statutory provisions

which provide that affidavits should in ordinary circumstances be sufficient

prima facie evidence of the statements of the petition, but where the verifying

affidavit is not sufficient, then and only then must opportunity be afforded for

the adducing of evidence and/or cross-examination of the deponent witnesses.

Page 8 of 10

I am in respectful agreement with the position articulated upon a consideration of the

form of pleadings required to be filed where a company is sought to be wound up on

just and equitable grounds.

It has been held that a company may be wound up for a number of reasons on just and

equitable grounds. Hence, it will suffice for the petition and supporting affidavit in such

a winding up application to set out the heads of complaint with sufficient details to

enable the Respondent to respond to the complaints made. Where a prima facie case

has been made in the winding up petition, the Court must exercise its wide discretion

judiciously and in conformity with procedural fairness.

This appears to be the English practice as well. In Fildes Bros. Ltd., Re [(1970) 1 All ER

923, it was held that in deciding a petition for winding up on just and equitable

grounds, facts existing at the time of hearing have to be taken in to account, but heads

of complaint will be as set forth in the petition.

In the present application, the winding up petition has sufficiently set out the heads of

complaint and provided evidence in the form of averments in the affidavit in support.

The Appellant cannot be asked to prove by documentary evidence the negative, such

as failure and neglect to have any board meetings, shareholders meetings and general

meetings.

The best evidence of holding such meetings are the minutes of such meetings. If the

Appellant did not take part in such meetings although informed, the best evidence is

the notification sent to the Appellant.

In the circumstances of the case, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court

should have exercised his discretion and called for evidence from the Appellant and

the Respondent Company prior to making an order on the winding up application. In

fact, the Respondent Company had in its written submissions filed in the Commercial

High Court, paragraph 8, indicated to Court that it may be prudent to call for oral

evidence.

Page 9 of 10

Accordingly, I am in agreement with the contention of Mr. Cooray, learned counsel for

the Appellant that the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court erred in not calling

for oral evidence and thereby failed to duly and properly exercise his discretion

judiciously.

Alternative Remedies

I will examine grounds 2 and 3 relied on by the learned Commercial High Court judge

together as they are interconnected.

In this context, I observe that the judgment does not specify the alternative reliefs the

learned Judge of the Commercial High Court had in mind.

It appears that the learned Judge may have taken into consideration the alternative

grounds set out at paragraph 46 of the written submissions filed by the Respondent

Company in the Commercial High Court.

They are:

(i) An action for oppression and mismanagement under sections 224 and 225

of the Act;

(ii) Seeking to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of the Company

under section 172 (1) of the Act;

(iii) Raising any issue of alleged oppression or mismanagement at the Board

Meeting and/or Shareholder Meeting of the Company.

The alternative remedy at (iii) does not arise as the Appellant contends that no such

meetings took place.

In so far as sections 224 and 225 of the Act are concerned, the learned counsel for the

Appellant drew our attention to section 227 of the Act which reads:

Notwithstanding the provisions of Part XII, at any stage of the winding up

proceedings in respect of a company, where a court is of the opinion that to wind

up the company would be prejudicial to the interests of a shareholder of the

Page 10 of 10

company, it shall be lawful for the court to act under the provisions of section

224 or section 225 in like manner, as if an application had been made to the

court under the provisions of either of those two sections.

Accordingly, the Court has the discretion to act under sections 224 or 225 of the Act at

any stage of the winding up proceedings. Where the Court is not inclined to exercise

this discretion, reasons will have to be given. In the present matter, the Commercial

High Court has failed to do so if this was indeed an alternative remedy it had in

contemplation.

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned Judge of the

Commercial High Court dated 11.07.2014.

I direct the Commercial High Court to conduct an inquiry into the winding up

application by granting parties the opportunity to lead oral and documentary evidence

on the matters pleaded. After such inquiry, the Commercial High Court shall make an

order according to law.

The appeal is partly allowed with costs.
