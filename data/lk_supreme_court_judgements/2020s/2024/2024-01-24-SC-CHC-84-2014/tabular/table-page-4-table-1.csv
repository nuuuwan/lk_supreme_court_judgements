"It is an established rule of interpretation that where there are statutes made in pari"
"materia, whatever has been determined in the construction of one of them is a sound"
"rule of construction for the other [Craies on Statute Law, 7th Ed., page 139]. In Crosley"
"v. Arkwright [(1788) 2 T.R. 603, 608, (1788) 100 E.R. 325, 328] Buller J. held that all"
"Acts relating to one subject must be construed in pari materia."
"The  Companies  Ordinance  No.  51  of  1938  and  the  Act  are 
in  pari  materia.  The"
"interpretation given to just and equitable in the former is applicable to the Act as well."
"Hence, the ground relied on by the Appellant is one which falls within Section 270 (f)"
"of the Act."
"Burden of Proof"
"The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court took the view that the Appellant has"
"failed  to  submit  any  documents  to  corroborate  the  matters  pleaded  in  the  petition"
"seeking the winding up of the Respondent Company. Court refers to the denial by Mrs."
"Anula Fernando of the matters pleaded in the winding up petition and states that it is"
"word  and  against  word  and  hence  no  reason  to  accept  one  version  over  the  other."
"Accordingly, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court holds that the Appellant"
"has failed to prove the allegations made in the winding up application."
"One important matter pleaded by the Appellant is that she holds 50% of the shares of"
"the Respondent Company and is also a Director. It is true that the Appellant has not"
"tendered  any  documentation  to  establish  that  she  is  a  shareholder  and  a  Director."
"Nevertheless, this pales into insignificance upon a consideration of the affidavit filed"
"by Mrs. Anula Fernando opposing the winding up application. She has, at paragraph 32"
"of her  affidavit, admitted that the  Appellant and she are the only  shareholders and"
"Directors  of  the  Respondent  Company. 
In  this  context  the  requirement  of  any"
"documentation to corroborate these two matters does not arise."
