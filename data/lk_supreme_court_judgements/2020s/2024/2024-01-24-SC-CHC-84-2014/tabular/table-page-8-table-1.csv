"I am in respectful agreement with the position articulated upon a consideration of the"
"form of pleadings required to be filed where a company is sought to be wound up on"
"just and equitable grounds."
"It has been held that a company may be wound up for a number of reasons on just and"
"equitable grounds. Hence, it will suffice for the petition and supporting affidavit in such"
"a winding up application to set out the heads of complaint with sufficient details to"
"enable the Respondent to respond to the complaints made. Where a prima facie case"
"has been made in the winding up petition, the Court must exercise its wide discretion"
"judiciously and in conformity with procedural fairness."
"This appears to be the English practice as well. In Fildes Bros. Ltd., Re [(1970) 1 All ER"
"923,  it  was  held  that  in  deciding  a  petition  for  winding  up  on  just  and  equitable"
"grounds, facts existing at the time of hearing have to be taken in to account, but heads"
"of complaint will be as set forth in the petition."
"In the present application, the winding up petition has sufficiently set out the heads of"
"complaint and provided evidence in the form of averments in the affidavit in support."
"The Appellant cannot be asked to prove by documentary evidence the negative, such"
"as failure and neglect to have any board meetings, shareholders meetings and general"
"meetings."
"The best evidence of holding such meetings are the minutes of such meetings. If the"
"Appellant did not take part in such meetings although informed, the best evidence is"
"the notification sent to the Appellant."
"In  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Commercial  High  Court"
"should have exercised his discretion and called for evidence from the Appellant and"
"the Respondent Company prior to making an order on the winding up application. In"
"fact, the Respondent Company had in its written submissions filed in the Commercial"
"High  Court,  paragraph  8,  indicated  to  Court  that  it  may  be  prudent  to  call  for  oral"
"evidence."
