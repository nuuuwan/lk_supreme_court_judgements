"question  of  whether  the  evidence  filed  (by  way  of  affidavit)  was  not  sufficient  to"

"""The court would not in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction, be satisfied"
"with prima facie evidence but would require the petitioner to substantiate his"
"case  more  fully;  that  in  such  cases  it  would  require,  where  practicable,  the"
"evidence of witnesses with direct knowledge of the matters to which they were"
"testifying, and on which they could be cross-examined, and which conformed to"
"the ordinary rules of the admissibility of evidence""."
