"restaurant, probably for the reason that the Plaintiff had not led any evidence at all"
"with regard to the calculation of such damages. The second matter is that the High"
"Court  has  not  considered  whether  the  Defendants  are  entitled  to  the  payment  of"
"liquidated  damages  arising  from  the  failure  of  the  Plaintiff  to  hand  over  physical"
"possession of the premises to the Defendants at the end of the lease period. This is a"
"matter that I shall consider at the end of this judgment in deciding the liability of the"
"parties."
