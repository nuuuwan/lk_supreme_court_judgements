"This  being  so,  the  first  question  that  I  must  decide  is  whether  the  Defendants  are"
"entitled to the monthly rental for the entire period of the lease or part thereof. In view"
"of the conclusion reached by me that the High Court was correct when it held that the"
"Defendants failed to hand over peaceful possession of the said premises to the Plaintiff"
"and  were  therefore  in  breach  of  their  contractual  obligations contained  in  P1  right"
"through the entire period of the lease, I am of the view that the Defendants are not"
"entitled to receive any rental for the entirety of the lease period. I must reiterate that"
"had  the  Defendants  terminated  P1  and  formally  demanded  that  the  premises  be"
"handed over, the Defendants would have been entitled to the payment of liquidated"
"damages in terms of P1 from the date the Plaintiff failed to vacate the premises until"
"the actual handing over of the premises."
