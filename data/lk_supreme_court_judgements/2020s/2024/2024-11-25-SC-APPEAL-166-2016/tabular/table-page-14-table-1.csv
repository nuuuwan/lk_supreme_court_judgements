"until May 2001 when the aforementioned payment of Rs. 125,000 is said to have been"

"Defendants did not  make  any effort  to inform the Plaintiff that  the payments have"
"been  regularized  and  that  the  Plaintiff  can  carry  out  the  business  of  operating  a"
"restaurant at the said premises."
