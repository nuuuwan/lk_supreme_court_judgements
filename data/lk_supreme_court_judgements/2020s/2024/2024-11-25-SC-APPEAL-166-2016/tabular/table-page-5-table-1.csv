eterioration of the relationship"

ccording to the Plaintiff, while he was carrying out the said improvements, an officer"
"from the Peopleâ€™s Bank [the Bank] had visited the said premises and informed him that"
"the said premises had been mortgaged as security for a loan taken by the Defendants"
"and as the Defendants had defaulted in the repayment of the loan taken by them, the"
"Bank had passed a resolution on 28th  March  1999 to  sell by public auction the  said"
"premises in due course. The Plaintiff states that at the time P1 was entered into, the"
"Defendants had not informed him that the said premises was subject to a mortgage"
"and that had he known such fact, he would not have taken the said premises on rent."
"The Plaintiff claims that in this background, fearing that the premises will be foreclosed"
"by the Bank, he did not proceed any further with the development of the said premises"
"as a restaurant, which was the purpose for which he had taken the premises on lease."
"The Plaintiff states further that he informed this position to the Defendants who had"
"apparently agreed to refund the payments made by the Plaintiff."
"I
t  is clear  from the  evidence  that  by September 1999  the  relationship  between  the"
"parties had deteriorated, with the Defendants claiming that the Plaintiff had stopped"
"the  payment  of  the  lease  rental  and  threatened  them  with  bodily  harm  unless  the"
"monies paid by the Plaintiff were refunded. These incidents had resulted in several"
"complaints being made to the Police in that regard by the Defendants and a statement"
"of  the  Plaintiff  being  recorded  by  the  Police.  In  spite  of  such  deterioration  of  the"
"relationship, and the inability of the Plaintiff to use and enjoy the said premises for the"
"intended  purpose,  the  Plaintiff  continued  to  occupy  the  said  premises  without  the"
"payment of the lease rental. Although it was open for either party to have prematurely"
"terminated  the Agreement, neither party sought to mitigate their losses by exercising"
"such right conferred on them by P1."
