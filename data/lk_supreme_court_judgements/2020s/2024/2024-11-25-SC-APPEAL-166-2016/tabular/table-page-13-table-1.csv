"premises had been mortgaged is not an issue as a mere mortgage of the property to"
"the Bank could not have prevented the Plaintiff from operating a restaurant at the said"
"premises. Instead, what mattered was whether the Defendants were in default of their"
"repayment obligations to the Bank. Action by the Bank to recover its dues would mean"
"that  the  security  offered  must  be  foreclosed,  with  the  result  that  the  Plaintiff  (a)"
"cannot use the said premises for the intended purpose as agreed in P1, and (b) has"
"been denied the opportunity of peacefully enjoying the leased premises."
