"In  Senadheerage  Chandrika  Sudarshani  v  Muthukuda  Herath  Mudiyanselage  Gedara"
"Somawathi [supra; at page 15], it was held that:"
"“…. the use of the aforesaid words in Section 83 require that, the Court applies an"
"objective  test  when  determining  the  intention  of  the  owner  from  the  attendant"
"circumstances.  Therefore,  if  the  claim  of  a  Constructive  Trust  is  to  succeed,  the"
"attendant circumstances must make it plainly clear to the ‘reasonable man’ that,"
"the  owner  did  not  intend  to  part  with  his  beneficial  interest  in  the  property.  A"
"secret or hidden intention to retain the beneficial interest will not do. The attendant"
"circumstances must be such that they would have demonstrated to the transferee"
"that  the  owner  intended  to  retain  the  beneficial  interest  in  the  property.  The"
"transferee  is  judged  here  as  standing  in  the  shoes  of  the  ‘reasonable  man’.  If  a"
"‘reasonable  man’  must  have  known  from  the  ‘attendant  circumstances’  that  the"
"owner  intended  to  retain  his  beneficial  interest  in  the  property,  the  transferee  is"
"deemed  to  hold  the  property  upon  a  Constructive  Trust  in  favour  of  the  owner."
"However,  if  a  ‘reasonable  man’  may  not  have  drawn  such  an  inference  from  the"
"attendant  circumstances,  the  transferee  holds  the  property  absolutely,  since  no"
"Constructive Trust can be deemed to have arisen. Further, the burden of proof lies"
"firmly on the person who claims a Constructive Trust to prove it.” [emphasis added]"
