"â€œthe Appellant brought an important fact that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent did not"
"so  much  as  call  either  Odayan  Kureishan  or  the  Notary  or  any  of  the  attesting"
"witnesses to give evidence regarding the said transaction. Therefore, the Appellant"
"strenuously has taken up an argument that the 2nd Defendant had failed to establish"
"that the said Odayan Kureishan held the property in trust for him."
