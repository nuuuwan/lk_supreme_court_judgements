"Section 92"
"“When the terms of any such contract, grant, or other disposition of property, or any"
"matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved"
"according to the last section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall"
"be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument, or their representatives"
"in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from"
"its terms. …” [emphasis added]"
"None of (a) the exceptions to Section 91, and (b) the provisos to Section 92, as indicated"

"T
he cumulative effect of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 91"
"of the Evidence Ordinance is that while the disposition of any immovable property must"
"be reduced to writing, proving the terms of a deed by which any immovable property has"
"been transferred can only be done by producing the deed itself or, where permissible, by"
"way of secondary evidence and in the manner provided therefor. It is important to note"
"that to this, Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance adds that no oral evidence that seeks"
"to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms contained in any instrument relating"
"to land can be received by a Court."
"S
ection 83 of the Trusts Ordinance"

owever, Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, reproduced below, acts as an exception to"

"“Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably"
"be  inferred,  consistently  with  the  attendant  circumstances  that  he  intended  to"
"dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such"
"property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.” [emphasis added]"
