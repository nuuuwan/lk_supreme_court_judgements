"[supra;  at  page  564],  Chief  Justice  Basnayake  though  delivering  the  minority  opinion,"
"referring to Section 83, rightly stated as follows:"
"“The section is designed to prevent transfers of property which on the face of the"
"instrument appear to be genuine transfers, but where an intention to dispose of the"
"beneficial  interest  cannot  reasonably  be  inferred  consistently  with  the  attendant"
"circumstances.  Neither  the  declaration  of  the  transferor  at  the  time  of  the"
"execution of the instrument nor his secret intentions are attendant circumstances."
"Attendant circumstances are to my mind circumstances which precede or follow"
"the  transfer  but  are  not  too  far  removed  in  point  of  time  to  be  regarded  as"
"attendant which expression in this context may be understood as “accompanying”"
"or “connected with”. Whether a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on"
"the facts of each case.” [emphasis added]"
