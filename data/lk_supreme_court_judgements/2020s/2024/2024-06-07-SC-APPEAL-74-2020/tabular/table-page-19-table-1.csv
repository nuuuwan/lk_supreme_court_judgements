"The second attendant circumstance relied upon by the 2nd Defendant that the execution"
"of P7 and P8 are also reflective of a further money lending transaction is at first sight far"
"removed in point of time to be regarded as attendant as held in Muttammah. However,"
"when viewed from the angle that P8 was executed to settle Kureishan and redeem P6, it"
"supports the position of the 2nd Defendant that the transaction between Kureishan and"
"himself  [i.e.  P6]  was  only  a  money  lending  transaction.  Thus,  the  intention  of  the  2nd"
"Defendant to continue to retain the beneficial interest in the said property is borne out"
"by the execution of P7 and P8, as well."
