Tendered on behalf of the Plaintiff Appellant Respondent on 23rd March 2021 Decided on: 7th June 2024

Obeyesekere, J

The Plaintiff Appellant Respondent [the Plaintiff] filed action in the District Court of

Matale [the District Court] against the 1st Defendant Respondent Respondent [the 1st

Defendant] and the 2nd Defendant Respondent [the 2nd Defendant] seeking the

following relief:

(a) A declaration that he is entitled to the property referred to in the schedule to the

plaint in extent of 3 roods less an extent of 16.67 perches; and

(b) An order that the Defendants be ejected from the said property and for vacant

possession thereof to be handed over to the Plaintiff.

4

The 1st Defendant filed her answer claiming that the plaint has not set out a cause of

action against her. The 2nd Defendant admitted in the amended answer filed by him that

he had executed a deed of transfer in respect of the said property in favour of a person

by the name of Odayan Kureishan [Kureishan]. The 2nd Defendant however claimed that

(a) the said Kureishan, (b) the 1st Defendant to whom the said property had subsequently

been transferred to by Kureishan, and (c) finally the Plaintiff to whom the 1st Defendant

had thereafter transferred the said property, are holding the said property in trust for the

2nd Defendant.

By its judgment delivered on 25th June 1999, the District Court:

(a) upheld the position of the 2nd Defendant that the beneficial interest in the said

property had not been transferred to Kureishan, and that the said property is being

held in trust for the 2nd Defendant by Kureishan, as well as by the 1st Defendant and

the Plaintiff; and

(b) directed the Plaintiff to transfer the said property to the 2nd Defendant upon the

payment of a sum of Rs. 110,000.

Dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court dismissing his action, the Plaintiff filed

an appeal in the Court of Appeal. By its judgment delivered on 4th April 2019, the Court of

Appeal set aside the judgment of the District Court and granted the relief prayed for by

the Plaintiff.

Questions of law

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Substituted 2A

Defendant Respondent Appellant [the 2A Defendant], the daughter of the 2nd

Defendant who had been substituted in place of the 2nd Defendant while the appeal was

pending before the Court of Appeal, sought and obtained the leave of this Court on 28th

July 2020 on the following four questions of law:

5

(1) Has the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that the learned District Judge has

rightly arrived at the conclusion that the 2nd Defendant had not vacated the

premises even after he had conveyed this property by Deed No. 3275 marked P6 to

Odayan Kureishan?

(2) Has the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that although this property had been

transferred and re-transferred by Deeds marked P1 P11 from time to time, the 2nd

Defendant and/or his parents had been in continuous possession thereof?

(3) Has the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to appreciate the findings of the

learned District Judge with regard to possession of the property which is claimed to

be the trust property?

(4) Has the Court of Appeal been in grave misconception of the law when it placed much

weight on the fact that the 2nd Defendant had failed miserably to establish the

existence of an oral agreement between the 2nd Defendant and Odayan Kureishan?

Although the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff too had raised a question of law i.e., Is

the 2nd Defendant entitled to plead constructive trust without making Kureishan as a party

to the District Court action?, this question was not pursued either in the written

submissions or at the hearing.

While I shall refer later in this judgment to the series of transactions between the 2nd

Defendant on the one hand and Kureishan, the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff on the

other, it would suffice to state at the outset that there are three primary issues that need

to be determined in this appeal. The first is whether Kureishan held the said property in

trust for the 2nd Defendant as provided for in Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance. The

second and third issues are whether the said trust endured through to the 1st Defendant,

and to the Plaintiff, respectively.

6

Facts in brief the position of the 2nd Defendant

The property which is the subject matter of this appeal had been purchased by K. A.

Somasunderam, the father of the 2nd Defendant, by Deed No. 1389 on 10th September

1951 [P1]. Together with his wife M. A. Somasunderam, K. A. Somasunderam had

transferred the said property to the wife of one Karuppiah by Deed No. 8366 dated 10th

November 1960 [P2]. Karuppiahs wife had re-transferred the said property to M. A.

Somasunderam and K. A. Somasunderam by Deed No. 8802 dated 16th July 1962 [P3]. It

is the position of the 2nd Defendant that P2 and P3 are reflective of a money lending

transaction where the Somasunderams had pledged the said property as security for a

loan taken from the wife of Karuppiah. The 2nd Defendant states that the property was

re-transferred to his parents by P3 at the time the mortgage was redeemed. The fact that

the said property remained in the possession of the Somasunderam family during the

period between P2 and P3 is not in dispute.

By Deed No. 31682 dated 16th November 1963 [P4], K. A. Somasunderam and M. A.

Somasunderam had transferred the said property to their nephew, T Wijayaratnam. It is

the position of the 2nd Defendant that P4 was also part of a money lending transaction,

and that the Somasunderam family continued to be in possession of the said property

after the execution of P4, as well. The 2nd Defendant claims that in 1987, Wijayaratnam

had requested that the monies borrowed by his parents way back in 1963 be returned,

and that as he himself did not have sufficient money to repay Wijayaratnam, he had

borrowed from Kureishan the required sum of money to pay Wijayaratnam.

Creation of a trust in favour of the 2nd Defendant

Accordingly, upon the debt owed to Wijayaratnam being settled, Wijayaratnam had

transferred the said property to the 2nd Defendant by Deed No. 3274 dated 23rd December

1987 [P5]. On the same date, the 2nd Defendant had transferred the said property to

Kureishan by Deed No. 3275 [P6] as security for the loan that the 2nd Defendant claims he

took from Kureishan to settle Wijayaratnam. The 2nd Defendants position is that although

P6 is said to be, on the face of it, an outright transfer, it was only a mortgage and was

executed to reflect the money lending transaction between himself and Kureishan.

7

The following question posed to the 2nd Defendant during cross examination and the

answer thereto contains the reason for the execution of P6 as a deed of transfer and

refers to the oral agreement between the 2nd Defendant and Kureishan that Kureishan

shall hold the said property in trust for the 2nd Defendant until the money borrowed from

Kureishan was repaid by the 2nd Defendant:

m%( ;uka lshkafka fuu Widjshg odmq kvqj;a" wo idlaIs fufyhjqjdg fuu Tmamqfjka ;uka whs;sh mejrefjs keye@ re'30"000$-la Khla .;a;d lsh,d" ;ukaf.a whs;sh me'6 Tmamqfjka Tvika l=frahsidkag mejre tl ;uka ms,s.kakjdo Tyqg whs;sh .shd lsh,d@ W( W.ia Tmamq ,shkafka keye" uqo,a b,a,qjdg' yosishg iskaklalr Tmamq ,shdf.k ;uhs uqo,a

.kqfokq lrkafka' lgska fldkafoaishla lshd .kakjd wdmiq uqo,a oqkaku ,shkjd lsh,d'

It would perhaps be important to mention that in spite of the execution of P6, possession

of the said property remained with the 2nd Defendant. Thus, in the event the version of

the 2nd Defendant that the beneficial interest in the said property was not transferred to

Kureishan by P6 is accepted, as was done by the District Court, P6 would signify the

beginning of a constructive trust over the said property in favour of the 2nd Defendant.

Whether the said trust endured the several other deeds executed after P6, firstly by

Kureishan and thereafter by the 1st Defendant, culminating in Deed No. 9632 dated 6th

April 1991 [P11], which is the deed of transfer upon which the Plaintiff purchased the

said property, thereby making the Plaintiff the current trustee of the said constructive

trust created in 1987 by P6, is a matter that remains to be considered.

Further transfers of the said property

The 2nd Defendant states that he was shot at by unknown assailants in November 1988,

and had to undergo medical treatment for a period of over two years, both in Sri Lanka

and India. It is his position that although Kureishan wanted the money returned, he did

not have sufficient resources to repay Kureishan and redeem the property as his business

had suffered during this period due to his absence. [Bg miafia uu wikSmfj,d bkak ldf,a l=frahsidka wejs;a uqo,a b,a,,d ug iEfykak lror l,d' ta ldf,a uf.a ,. uqo,a ;snqfka keye' uf.a fj<o jHdmdr Tlafldau wvmK fj,d .shd' jHdmdr lr .kag ners ;;a;ajhla we;s jqkd .ug

The 2nd Defendant states that it is at this point that the husband of the 1st Defendant, one

Rajaguru, whom he had known for a long period of time, agreed to assist him raise the

necessary finances to settle Kureishan. The evidence of the 2nd Defendant in this regard

is as follows:

.kakus miafia uqo,a n,d .uq lsh,d lsjsjd'

As part of the above transaction, Kureishan had initially mortgaged the said property to

the 1st Defendant by Mortgage Bond No. 3243 dated 1st August 1990 [P7] upon the

payment of a sum of Rs. 50,000 by the husband of the 1st Defendant. Kureishan is then

said to have mortgaged an extent of 16.67 perches of the said property to one Tikiri

Bandara by Deed No. 3346 dated 2nd November 1990 [2V1]. On 1st December 1990,

Kureishan had transferred the entire extent of the said property to the 1st Defendant by

Deed No. 3382 [P8] for a further sum of Rs. 60,000. It is the position of the 2nd Defendant

that the constructive trust created in his favour by P6 continued through to the 1st

Defendant by P7 and P8. I should perhaps reiterate that even though P7, 2V1 and P8 were

executed in respect of the said property in favour of the 1st Defendant as well as Tikiri

Bandara, the 2nd Defendant continued to be in possession of the said property

throughout, with neither the 1st Defendant nor Tikiri Bandara taking any steps to evict the

2nd Defendant.

The 1st Defendant had in turn transferred the said property to one Musammil for a sum

of Rs. 60,000 by Deed No. 3393 dated 6th December 1990 [P9], only for it to be re-

transferred to the 1st Defendant on 13th February 1991 by Deed No. 3438 [P10] with the

consideration being Rs. 60,000. Although the husband of the 1st Defendant gave evidence

before the District Court, no explanation was tendered with regard to the circumstances

under which P9 or P10 were executed. On 6th April 1991, the 1st Defendant had

9

transferred the said property to the Plaintiff by P11 for a sum of Rs. 300,000 which value

is significantly higher than P8 and P10. It was admitted at the trial by the Plaintiff as well

as by the husband of the 1st Defendant that the 2nd Defendant continued to be in

possession of the said property, in spite of the execution of P11.

The position of the Plaintiff

In his plaint, the Plaintiff pleaded that he purchased the said property from the 1st

Defendant by P11 on 6th April 1991, for a purchase consideration of Rs. 300,000. However,

he states that at the time of execution of P11, he only paid a sum of Rs. 50,000 to the 1st

Defendant and that the balance sum of Rs. 250,000 was due to be paid (a) after the 1st

Defendant had redeemed the conditional transfer executed by her in favour of Tikiri

Bandara in respect of an extent of 16.67 perches of the said property, and (b) after

handing over vacant possession of the said property on or before 31st May 1991. While

this arrangement is reflected in P11, the Plaintiff states that the 1st Defendant failed to

hand over the said property as promised, resulting in the institution of action on 21st May

1992 against the 1st Defendant as well as the 2nd Defendant who was in possession of the

said property, purportedly as an agent of the 1st Defendant.

In his evidence, the Plaintiff stated that he was informed by one Siripala, a property agent

in Matale that the said property is for sale. He had thereafter accompanied Siripala to the

said property where he had met the husband of the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff claims

that he was shown around the property and was informed that the personal belongings

of the 1st Defendant are stored inside the house situated on the said property. The

Plaintiff admits that he did not go inside the house and states that he did not meet anyone

else living inside the house. The Plaintiff states further that the Notary Public who

executed P11 had carried out a search at the Land Registry prior to the execution of the

said deed, to which Siripala was a witness. The above version of the Plaintiff was

corroborated by the evidence of Siripala and the husband of the 1st Defendant, who

however admitted later that the 2nd Defendant was in possession of the said property at

the time of the Plaintiffs visit.

10

Reception of oral evidence in light of an existing instrument

Bearing in mind that the 2nd Defendant is seeking to contradict the terms of P6 and P8, as

well as P11 which are on the face of it outright transfers and are the instruments by which

the said property was transferred to Kureishan, the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff,

respectively, and in order to give context to the submissions of the learned Counsel, I shall

at the outset refer to the provisions of two laws.

The first is the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, of which Section 2 (prior to its amendment

by the Prevention of Frauds (Amendment) Act, No. 30 of 2022) provided as follows:

No sale, purchase, transfer, assignment, or mortgage of land or other immovable

property, and no promise, bargain, contract, or agreement for effecting any such

object, or for establishing any security, interest, or incumbrance affecting land or

other immovable property (other than a lease at will, or for any period not exceeding

one month), nor any contract or agreement for the future sale or purchase of any

land or other immovable property, and no notice, given under the provisions of the

Thesawalamai Pre-emption Ordinance, of an intention or proposal to sell any

undivided share or interest in land held in joint or common ownership, shall be in

force or avail in law unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party

making the same, or by some person lawfully authorized by him or her in the

presence of a licensed notary public and two or more witnesses present at the same

time, and unless the execution of such writing, deed, or instrument be duly attested

by such notary and witnesses. [emphasis added]

The second is the Evidence Ordinance of which Sections 91 and 92 provide as follows:

Section 91

When the terms of a contract, or of a grant, or of any other disposition of property

have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a document, and in

all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a

document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant,

11

or other disposition of property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or

secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible

under the provisions herein before contained. [emphasis added]

Section 92

When the terms of any such contract, grant, or other disposition of property, or any

matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved

according to the last section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall

be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument, or their representatives

in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from

its terms. [emphasis added]

None of (a) the exceptions to Section 91, and (b) the provisos to Section 92, as indicated

in the respective provisions, arise for consideration in this appeal.

The cumulative effect of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 91

of the Evidence Ordinance is that while the disposition of any immovable property must

be reduced to writing, proving the terms of a deed by which any immovable property has

been transferred can only be done by producing the deed itself or, where permissible, by

way of secondary evidence and in the manner provided therefor. It is important to note

that to this, Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance adds that no oral evidence that seeks

to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms contained in any instrument relating

to land can be received by a Court.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance

However, Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, reproduced below, acts as an exception to

the rule laid down in Section 92:

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably

be inferred, consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such

property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative. [emphasis added]

12

In Muttammah v Thiyagarajah [62 NLR 559] H.N.G. Fernando, J (as he then was) referring

to Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance, stated as follows at page 571:

The plaintiff sought to prove the oral promise to reconvey not in order to enforce

that promise, but only to establish an attendant circumstance from which it could

be inferred that the beneficial interest did not pass. Although that promise was of

no force or avail in law by reason of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance,

it is nevertheless a fact from which an inference of the nature contemplated in

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance properly arises. The Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance does not prohibit the proof of such an act. If the arguments of counsel for

the appellant based on the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and on section 92 of the

Evidence Ordinance are to be accepted, then it will be found that not only section 83,

but also many of the other provisions in Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance will be

nugatory. If for example attendant circumstances in Section 83 means only

matters contained in an instrument of transfer of property it is difficult to see how a

conveyance of property can be held in trust unless indeed its terms are such as to

create an express trust. [emphasis added]

A similar view was expressed in Balasubramanium and Another v Vellayar Krishnapillai

and Another [(2012) 1 Sri LR 261] where Sripavan, J (as he then was) referring to the

judgment in Dayawathie and Others v Gunasekera and Another [(1991) 1 Sri LR 115]

stated [at page 267] that this Court has held that the provisions of the Prevention of

Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance do not bar parole evidence to

prove a constructive trust and that the transferor did not intend to pass the beneficial

interest in the property. In such a case, extrinsic evidence to prove attendant

circumstances can be properly received in evidence to prove a resulting trust.

In Jude Fernando v Malani Fernando and Another [(2017) 1 Sri LR 230; at page 236], Sisira

De Abrew, J reiterated that, Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and

Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance do not operate as a bar to lead parole evidence to

prove a constructive trust and to prove that the transferor did not intend to dispose of

beneficial interest in the property.

13

Application of Section 83 caution and scrutiny

Section 83 thus being a significantly generous exception, it has been held that in applying

Section 83, Courts must exercise great caution. In Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v

Muthukuda Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara Somawathi [SC Appeal No. 173/2011; SC

minutes of 6th April 2017], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J stated [at page 15] that:

The Court has to keep in mind that, a notarially attested deed of transfer should

not be lightly declared to be a nullity. The Court must also guard against allowing a

false or belated claim of Trust made by a transferor who has transferred his

property and then had second thoughts or seeks to profit from changed

circumstances. Dalton Js observations made close to 90 years ago in Mohamadu vs.

Pathuamma [11 CLR 48 at page 49], (that) It is becoming not uncommon by the

mere allegation of a trust to seek to evade the very salutary provisions of (the

Evidence) Ordinance to which I have referred, continues to remain a salutary

caution. [emphasis added]

The need for Court to carefully scrutinise the evidence before it when Section 83 is sought

to be applied was considered by Aluwihare, PC, J in Watagodagedara Mallika

Chandralatha v Herath Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda and Another [SC Appeal No.

185/2015; SC minutes of 4th December 2017] when His Lordship held [at page 8] as

follows:

One needs to bear in mind that where a constructive trust within the meaning of

Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance is asserted, it is incumbent on the court to

meticulously examine the evidence placed before the court, the reason being, on the

face value the evidence placed may give the appearance of a straight forward

transaction of a sale but the real intention of the parties can only be gleaned from

a close scrutiny of the circumstances under which the transaction was effected.

And the intention of the parties is of paramount importance. [emphasis added]

14

Section 83 - what is an attendant circumstance?

The application of the test laid down in Section 83 would enable the Court to decide

whether the owner of the property intended to dispose his or her beneficial interest in

the said property when he or she executed the relevant deed. Accordingly, the intention

of the owner must both be reasonably inferred from and consistent with the attendant

circumstances surrounding the transfer.

What, then, would be an attendant circumstance? In Muttammah v Thiyagarajah

[supra; at page 564], Chief Justice Basnayake though delivering the minority opinion,

referring to Section 83, rightly stated as follows:

The section is designed to prevent transfers of property which on the face of the

instrument appear to be genuine transfers, but where an intention to dispose of the

beneficial interest cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant

circumstances. Neither the declaration of the transferor at the time of the

execution of the instrument nor his secret intentions are attendant circumstances.

Attendant circumstances are to my mind circumstances which precede or follow

the transfer but are not too far removed in point of time to be regarded as

attendant which expression in this context may be understood as accompanying

or connected with. Whether a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on

the facts of each case. [emphasis added]

In Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v Muthukuda Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara

Somawathi [supra; at page 14], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J stated that, The words

attendant circumstances can be broadly described as meaning the facts surrounding the

transaction. In Blacks Law Dictionary (9th Edition) the words attendant circumstance, as

used in the American Law, have been defined as A fact that is situationally relevant to a

particular event or occurrence. [emphasis added] Thus, Jayawardena, PC, J echoed with

approval, the views expressed by Chief Justice Basnayake in Muttammah.

Dias, J stated thus in Ehiya Lebbe v Majeed [48 NLR 357; at page 359]:

15

There are certain tests for ascertaining into which category a case falls. Thus if the

transferor continued to remain in possession after the conveyance, or if the

transferor paid the whole cost of the conveyance or if the consideration expressed

on the deed is utterly inadequate to what would be the fair purchase money for the

property conveyed all these are circumstances which would show whether the

transaction was a genuine sale for valuable consideration, or something else.

In Thisa Nona and Three Others v Premadasa [(1997) 1 Sri LR 169], a judgment of the

Court of Appeal, Wigneswaran, J held that the following circumstances which transpired

in that case were relevant on the question of whether the transaction was a loan

transaction or an outright transfer:

(a) The fact that a non-notarial document was signed by the transferee

contemporaneous to the impugned deed of transfer, agreeing to re-transfer the

land if the sum of Rs. 1,500 referred to in the deed was paid within six years;

(b) The payment of stamp duty and the Notarys fees by the transferor;

(c) The fact that the transfer deed came into existence in the course of a series of

money lending transactions;

(d) The continued possession of the premises in suit by the transferor in the same

manner as she did before the transfer deed was executed.

It is clear that our Courts have identified over the years different circumstances as being

attendant circumstances within the meaning of Section 83, and emphasised that, what

an attendant circumstance is and the weight that must be attached to such circumstance

in reasonably inferring the intention of the owner, would depend on the facts and

circumstances of each case. It would therefore mean that a circumstance which is

attendant in one case may not be so in another.

Accordingly, I am of the view that it is in light of the sequence of events and the nature of

the attendant circumstances peculiar to a particular case, that a Court must arrive at its

conclusion on whether Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance applies to that particular case.

16

The burden of proof and standard of proof

The burden of proof in establishing the applicability of Section 83 lies on the person who

claims that he or she did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the property to

the transferee. In Watagodagedara Mallika Chandralatha v Herath Mudiyanselage

Punchi Banda and Another [supra] Aluwihare, PC, J cited with approval the following

passage from The Reception in Ceylon of the English Trust (1971) by L.J.M. Cooray:

Where a person has a notarial conveyance in his favour, courts have placed a heavy

burden on the transferor to prove facts bringing himself within Section 83. [emphasis

added]

In Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v Muthukuda Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara

Somawathi [supra; at page 15], it was held that:

. the use of the aforesaid words in Section 83 require that, the Court applies an

objective test when determining the intention of the owner from the attendant

circumstances. Therefore, if the claim of a Constructive Trust is to succeed, the

attendant circumstances must make it plainly clear to the reasonable man that,

the owner did not intend to part with his beneficial interest in the property. A

secret or hidden intention to retain the beneficial interest will not do. The attendant

circumstances must be such that they would have demonstrated to the transferee

that the owner intended to retain the beneficial interest in the property. The

transferee is judged here as standing in the shoes of the reasonable man. If a

reasonable man must have known from the attendant circumstances that the

owner intended to retain his beneficial interest in the property, the transferee is

deemed to hold the property upon a Constructive Trust in favour of the owner.

However, if a reasonable man may not have drawn such an inference from the

attendant circumstances, the transferee holds the property absolutely, since no

Constructive Trust can be deemed to have arisen. Further, the burden of proof lies

firmly on the person who claims a Constructive Trust to prove it. [emphasis added]

17

Attendant circumstances relied upon by the 2nd Defendant

At the trial, the 2nd Defendant relied on the following four attendant circumstances in

support of his position that Kureishan had agreed to re-transfer the said property upon

the payment of the money borrowed by him and that he had no intention of transferring

the beneficial interest in the said property to Kureishan by P6, or for that matter to the

1st Defendant, by P8:

(a) The transaction with Kureishan reflected by P5 and evidenced by P6 was purely a

money lending transaction;

(b) The execution of P7 and P8 are also reflective of a further money lending transaction

between Kureishan, the 1st Defendant and himself and gives context to the previous

transaction with Kureishan;

(c) At all times since 1951, the 2nd Defendant and his family have been in possession of

the said property;

(d) On each occasion that the impugned deeds [P6, P8 and P11] were executed, the said

property had a much higher market value than what was declared as consideration

for the said property in such deeds.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant that the reason for the

2nd Defendant to continue to remain in possession of the said property, which in itself is

cited as the third circumstance, and the consideration that passed for P6 and P8 are

reflective of the underlying money lending transactions referred to in the first two

circumstances. I shall therefore consider each of the said attendant circumstances

separately as well as cumulatively and thereafter the findings of the District Court on the

said circumstances, in order to ascertain the real character of P6, and consequently, P8

and P11.

18

Money lending transactions The first circumstance relied upon by the 2nd Defendant is that his transaction with

Kureishan reflected by P5 and P6, (a) was to raise money in order to settle what he owed

Wijayaratnam, (b) was purely a money lending transaction with the agreement being that

Kureishan would re-transfer the said property upon the re-payment of the loan, and (c)

was not entered into with an intention of transferring the beneficial interest in the said

property to Kureishan.

The above position of the 2nd Defendant is borne out by the following important factors

and have been relied upon by the District Court:

(a) P5 was executed by Wijayaratnam in favour of the 2nd Defendant upon the

repayment of the money due to Wijayaratnam by utilising the money that the 2nd

Defendant had borrowed from Kureishan;

(b) On the same date and seemingly simultaneously, by way of consecutively numbered

deeds, the 2nd Defendant executed the transfer deed P6 in respect of the said

property in favour of Kureishan;

(c) The 2nd Defendant remained in possession;

(d) Kureishan did not take any steps to have his name registered at the local authority

or to have the 2nd Defendant ejected from the said property.

The finding of the District Court in this regard is as follows: 02 js;a;slsre lshd isgskafka jsPhr;akusg fuu foam, mjrd uqo,a ,nd.ekSfuka miqj tu uqo,a Tyq b,a,d isgs nejska" foam, l=fraIdkaf.a kuska mjrd uqo,a ,ndf.k jsPhr;akusg oqka njh' jsPhr;akus jsiska 2 js;a;slreg fuu foam, wdmiq mjrk ,o Tmamqj me( 5 f,io" 2 js;a;slre jsiska l=fraIdkag mjrk ,o Tmamqj me( 6 f,io" bosrsm;a lr we;' fuu Tmamq folu tlu osk tkus 87.12.23 osk tlu fkd;drsia jrhd bosrsmsgos ,shd iy;sl lr we;s w;r thg ,ndos we;af;ao 3274 yd 3275 hk wxlhkah' tkus fuu Tmamq folu tlu wjia:dfjsos ,shd iy;sl lr we;' fuu lreKq j,ska 2

js;a;slref.a idCIsh ikd: fjs'

19

The second attendant circumstance relied upon by the 2nd Defendant that the execution

of P7 and P8 are also reflective of a further money lending transaction is at first sight far

removed in point of time to be regarded as attendant as held in Muttammah. However,

when viewed from the angle that P8 was executed to settle Kureishan and redeem P6, it

supports the position of the 2nd Defendant that the transaction between Kureishan and

himself [i.e. P6] was only a money lending transaction. Thus, the intention of the 2nd

Defendant to continue to retain the beneficial interest in the said property is borne out

by the execution of P7 and P8, as well.

Furthermore, if the 2nd Defendant was not actively involved in the transaction between

Kureishan and the 1st Defendant, the most natural course of action would have been to

execute a transfer [P8], instead of a mortgage followed by a transfer [P7 and P8], and for

the 1st Defendant to have taken possession of the said property, which the 1st Defendant

failed to do. The active involvement of the 2nd Defendant in the transaction between

Kureishan and the 1st Defendant is further and most significantly supported by the

evidence of the 2nd Defendant, to which I have already referred, that to begin with, it was

the husband of the 1st Defendant who had assisted the 2nd Defendant to raise the

necessary finances to settle Kureishan. Thus, it was the position of the 2nd Defendant that

the underlying money lending transaction to settle Kureishan is, in fact, the singular

reason for the execution of P8.

Continued possession by the 2nd Defendant The third and the most important attendant circumstance relied upon by the 2nd

Defendant is that he continued to remain in possession of the said property at all times

and never parted with the possession of the said property in spite of the execution of P6,

and for that matter, P8 and P11. The learned District Judge has placed significant

importance on the continued possession of the said property by the 2nd Defendant in

arriving at his conclusion that Kureishan held the said property in trust for the 2nd

Defendant.

I re-produce below in its entirety the findings of the District Court on the possession of

the said property by the 2nd Defendant as the first three questions of law raised in this

20

appeal are directly referable to the said findings and the consequent failure on the part

of the Court of Appeal to consider the said findings:

Thus, the continued possession of the said property by the 2nd Defendant gives context

to the first two attendant circumstances relied upon by the 2nd Defendant.

Value at the time of transfer

The fourth and final attendant circumstance is that the value of the said property was

much higher than what was reflected as consideration for the said property in P6, as well

as in P8. If the version of the 2nd Defendant that P6 and P8 reflected a money lending

transaction is to be accepted, the consideration declared therein should not be

commensurate to the market value of the said property at the time P6 and P8 were

executed.

The 2nd Defendant led the evidence of a Court appointed Valuer on whom a Commission

had been issued. It was his evidence that the said property was situated 200 feet away

from the main road, behind the business premises of the 2nd Defendant, and that having

taken the value of similar properties adjacent to the said property, he has valued the said

property as follows:

(a) At Rs. 300,000 400,000 in 1987 whereas the consideration for P6 was only Rs.

30,000;

(b) At Rs.600,000 800,000 in 1991 whereas the total consideration for P7 and P8 was

only Rs. 110,000 and even for P11, it was only Rs. 300,000.

This evidence had not been contradicted by the Plaintiff or the 1st Defendant. The District

Court has accepted the above evidence and determined that P6 does not reflect the

correct value of the said property.

22

Judgment of the District Court It is clear from the above findings of fact reached by the learned District Judge that he has

quite correctly placed much reliance on the transactions that led to the execution of P6

and P8, the value at which P6 was conveyed, and in particular on the 2nd Defendant

remaining in possession of the said property at all times in arriving at his conclusion that:

(a) the beneficial interest in the said property has not been transferred to Kureishan;

(b) the said property was held in trust by Kureishan for the 2nd Defendant; and

(c) the requirements of Section 83 have been satisfied by the 2nd Defendant.

In view of the above findings, which are supported by the evidence led by the parties, the

District Court had proceeded to hold that all subsequent transfers are also subject to the

trust, and that the 2nd Defendant is entitled to have the said property re-transferred to

him. Thus, all three primary issues that arise for determination in this appeal have been

answered by the District Court in favour of the 2nd Defendant.

There are two matters that I wish to advert to for the sake of completeness, prior to

considering the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The first is that the finding of the District

Court that P8 and P11 are subject to the trust created by P6 is supported by the judgment

of this Court in Perera v Fernando and Another [(2011) 2 Sri LR 192]. The facts being

similar as in this case, Suresh Chandra, J held [at page 197] that:

It would be apparent from the evidence that the first transaction was not an

absolute transfer as seen from the evidence but the question arises as to what was

conveyed by the transferee on the first transaction to the transferee on the second

transaction since the first transferee Dharmalatha did not have absolute title to the

property. What she could convey to the 2nd defendant was only the right she had

in respect of the said property which was not absolute title. In these circumstances

it would be necessary to conclude that both transfers did not convey absolute title to

the transferees and that they held the property in trust for the transferor as the

23

transferor in both instances had not intended to convey the beneficial interest in

respect of the property. This is in line with the principle laid down in Section 83

[emphasis added]

A similar conclusion was reached in Jayasooriya Kuranage Romold Dickson Sumithra

Perera v Jayasooriya Kuranage Padma Jenat Jasintha Perera and Others [SC Appeal

110/2018; SC minutes of 3rd April 2019; at page 13].

Is the Plaintiff a transferee in good faith?

The second matter that I wish to advert to is the applicability of Sections 65(1) and 66(1)

of the Trusts Ordinance, which are re-produced below:

Section 65(1)

Where trust property comes into the hands of a third person inconsistently with

the trust, the beneficiary may institute a suit for a declaration that the property is

comprised in the trust.

Section 66(1)

Nothing in section 65 entitles the beneficiary to any right in respect of property in

the hands of

(a) a transferee in good faith for consideration without having notice of the trust,

either when the purchase money was paid, or when the conveyance was

executed; or

(b) a transferee for consideration from such a transferee. [emphasis added] In Warnakulasuriyage Charlert Kusumawathi Kulasuriya v Don Wimal Harischandra

Gunathilaka [SC Appeal No. 157/2011; SC minutes of 4th April 2014] Tilakawardane, J

referring to Secon 66(1) stated [at page 14] that, it is well established law that where

the legal tle has passed to a bona de purchaser for value without noce, equity refuses

to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former benecial owner of the property.

24

This is further armed by Secon 98 of the Trusts Ordinance which states that Nothing

contained in this Chapter shall impair the rights of transferees in good faith for valuable

consideraon. .

The 2nd Defendant did not initiate action as provided by Section 65(1) but raised the

existence of a constructive trust for the first time in his answer. In addition to raising

several issues in that regard, the 2nd Defendant also raised an issue that the Plaintiff and

the 1st Defendant have acted fraudulently in executing P11, which issue has been

answered by the District Court in the affirmative. If the Plaintiff was a transferee in good

faith and did not have notice of the constructive trust in favour of the 2nd Defendant, it

was open for him to have claimed the benefit of Section 66(1) and to have raised an issue

in that regard. However, no such issue was raised before the District Court nor was it

agitated in appeal before the Court of Appeal or this Court.

Even though no issue was raised, the Plaintiff did state in his evidence that the house

situated on the said property was not occupied by anyone else at the time he visited the

said property. This evidence has been rejected by the District Court due to the admission

by the husband of the 1st Defendant that the 2nd Defendant was in fact in possession of

the said property at the time of the said visit by the Plaintiff and at the time the 1st

Defendant executed the deed in favour of the Plaintiff.

The District Court has also pointed out that there would have been no impediment to the

Plaintiff taking over possession of the said property at the time P11 was executed if the

keys to the house situated on the said property were with the 1st Defendant, as claimed

by the Plaintiff, and that instead the true reason for the Plaintiff not being able to take

over possession was the fact that possession was with the 2nd Defendant. This position

remained uncontested. Thus, even in the absence of an issue, the bona fides of the

Plaintiff and the fact that he did not have notice of the constructive trust have been

rejected by the District Court.

25

The judgment of the Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal has not considered at all the above findings of fact reached by the

District Court that possession of the said property remained at all times with the 2nd

Defendant, and that until action was filed by the Plaintiff, neither Kureishan nor the 1st

Defendant had ever challenged the right of the 2nd Defendant to possess the said

property. As I have already observed, the first three questions of law relate to this critical

failure on the part of the Court of Appeal to consider the thrust of the judgment of the

District Court, and therefore the said questions of law must be answered in the

affirmative.

Instead, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on two grounds.

The first ground is that, the said deed P6 had been executed way back in 1987, the 2nd

Defendant Respondent never made any attempt to challenge the said deed during the

entire period of more than 9 years which elapsed up to the institution of the instant action

by the Appellant.

This finding is incorrect as the position of the 2nd Defendant was that P6 was purely a

money lending transaction, and that the delay in repayment of the moneys borrowed and

the redemption of P6 was due to the attempt on his life and the subsequent disruption

to his business. It is also not denied that in any event, Kureishan did not try to dispossess

the 2nd Defendant.

The second ground is that:

the Appellant brought an important fact that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent did not

so much as call either Odayan Kureishan or the Notary or any of the attesting

witnesses to give evidence regarding the said transaction. Therefore, the Appellant

strenuously has taken up an argument that the 2nd Defendant had failed to establish

that the said Odayan Kureishan held the property in trust for him.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the entire claim of the 2nd Defendant

Respondent is based on the premise that Deed P6 by which he conveyed the land and

26

premises to Odayan Kureishan was subject to an oral agreement to re-convey upon

repayment of the consideration which was purported to be a loan. However, this

Court is of the view that the 2nd Defendant Respondent was not intensely entitled

to lead parole evidence to establish the purported oral agreements with Odayan

Kureishan to re-convey the property.

This finding too is incorrect. The fundamental premise on which Section 83 applies is to

ascertain whether the owner intended to transfer the beneficial interest in the property

in question, which intention must be reasonably inferred from, and be consistent with

the attendant circumstances surrounding the transfer. While it is true that the 2nd

Defendant did not call Kureishan to establish his claim, I am satisfied that the four

attendant circumstances relied upon by the 2nd Defendant have established a

constructive trust in his favour. The fourth question of law too must therefore be

answered in the affirmative.

Conclusion

I am of the view that as Kureishan did not have any beneficial interest over the said

property but instead was holding the said property in trust for the 2nd Defendant, he could

not have transferred a better title than what he had to the 1st Defendant nor could the 1st

Defendant have done so in favour of the Plaintiff by P11. The aforementioned attendant

circumstances relied upon by the 2nd Defendant, the disparity between the value of the

said property and the consideration that passed on P11, and the finding that the Plaintiff

was not a bona de purchaser for value without noce, all point towards the survival of

the construcve trust in favour of the 2nd Defendant. Accordingly, the trusteeship merely

changed hands from the 1st Defendant to the Plain upon the execuon of P11.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that:

(a) The Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to correctly apply the provisions of

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance;

27

(b) The Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to consider that the 2nd Defendant

has been in possession of the said property at all times and that this attendant

circumstance has not been displaced by the Plaintiff;

(c) The Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to consider the uncontradicted

evidence of the 2nd Defendant that Kureishan held the said property in trust for the

2nd Defendant by P6, and that P8 and P11 were subject to the said trust;

(d) The Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to consider the fact that the District

Court has analysed and applied the evidence in light of the test laid down in Section

83.

I would therefore answer all four questions of law raised by the learned Counsel for the

2nd Defendant in the affirmative and allow this appeal. The judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 4th April 2019 is accordingly set aside and the judgment of the District Court

dated 25th June 1999 is affirmed. I make no order for costs.
