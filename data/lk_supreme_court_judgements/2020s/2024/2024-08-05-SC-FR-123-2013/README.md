Respondents on 12th February 2024.

ARGUED ON: 12th February 2024.

DECIDED ON: 05th August 2024

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioner, namely Priyancy Don Liyanaarachchi, (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) filed this application in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka by Petition dated

11th April 2013 seeking, inter alia, a declaration that his fundamental right guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been violated due to the actions, omission,

and/or failure to act/or neglect to perform the duty of/by one or more of Respondents.

When the matter was taken up on 29th July 2013, the Court granted leave to proceed

under Article 12(1).

2. Before delving into my analysis of the present case, it is imperative to undertake the

somewhat arduous yet essential task of tracing the excessively prolonged journey of

the Petitioners grievances and appeals as they have navigated, although more oft than

not unnecessarily and sometimes unfittingly, through the corridors of various public

institutions and the officials employed therein.

3. The Petitioner is employed as the Media Officer of the National Police Commission. As

per the Petitioner, the sequence of events preceding the Petitioners employment is as

follows; the Petitioner was previously engaged as a Grade 1 Officer of the Translators

Service to the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs. Thereafter, the

Petitioner applied for the post of Public Relations and Information Officer of the

National Police Commission, followed by an interview and the subsequent selection of

the Petitioner to the said post by letter dated 23rd November 2004 from the Secretary

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 22

of the National Police Commission.1 Accordingly, the Petitioner received approval for

release on secondment from his pre-existing employment from the Ministry of Public

Administration and the Public Service Commission as evinced by letter dated 18th April

2005.2 A perusal of P7 confirms the Petitioners contention that he was offered an

additional 33% increase of his existing salary upon the commencement of his post

as the Public Relations and Information Officer.

4. Subsequently, however, the Petitioner was called for a second interview by the

National Police Commission and offered the post of Media Officer to the National

Police Commission, which, according to the Petitioner, he accepted upon the condition

that he be placed on a salary scale equivalent to or higher than the salary drawn by

him as a Grade 1 Officer of the Translators Service. According to the Petitioner, such

condition was communicated to the Secretary of the National Police Commission, who

informed the Petitioner that the salary associated with the post of Media Officer was

being revised and would be informed of in due course. Therefore, a Scheme of

Recruitment did not exist when the Petitioner was appointed to the post of Media

Officer by appointment letter dated 01st December 2004.3

5. By letter dated 10th March 2006,4 the then Assistant Secretary of the National Police

Commission informed the Petitioner that the Petitioners existing salary scale, TA-5-1

under Public Administration Circular No. 15/2003, was revised to TB-5-1 as per Public

Administration Circular No. 09/2004. The Petitioner contends that such revised salary

scale was below the salary of his previous employment as a Grade 1 Translator of the

Translators Service. P13 enunciates that such revision was to be applicable from the

commencement date, namely 1st January 2005, of the Petitioners employment as

Media Officer to the National Police Commission.

6. Thereafter, under the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006,5 by letter dated 14th

September 2006, the Director General specified that the Petitioner is to be placed on

the salary scale of MN-4-2006.6 Simultaneously, a Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) for

the post of Media Officer to the National Police Commission dated 24th May 20077 was

formulated and approved in terms of Public Administration Circular No. 06/20068

which also confirmed the placement of the Petitioner on the MN-4-2006 salary scale.

7. The Petitioner asserts that, in fact, he should be placed on the SL-1-2006 salary scale

instead on the basis that the post of a Media Officer falls under Staff Grade posts,

drawing a comparison between the post of Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative

Development, also a staff grade post which was previous placed under salary scale TB-

5-1 under Circular No. 09/2004 and revised to SL-1-2006 under Circular No. 06/2006.

8. The Petitioner contends that the decision is unreasonable, illegal, and contrary to

Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 as, according to this Circular, a Grade 1

Translator should be paid according to the MN-6 salary scale. The Petitioner insists

that his position should reflect this pay scale on the basis that he joined the National

Police Commission with the understanding that he would receive a salary equivalent

to or higher than that of a Grade 1 Translator.

9. For completion of facts, it must be noted that the Petitioners salary scale was

subsequently revised to salary scale MN-4-2006A in terms of Public Administration

Circular No. 06/2006(iv) and the Petitioner was informed of such revision by the Deputy

Secretary (Administration and Finance) of the National Police Commission by letter

dated 17th October 2007.9

10. The Petitioner submitted an appeal dated 28th June 2007,10 to which the National

Salaries and Cadre Commission responded by letter dated 90th August 2007 and

informed the Petitioner that the Commission could not recommend an alternative

salary scale.11 The reason provided by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission is

reproduced below:

An translation of the above is provided herein:

According to the newspaper notification published on 03.10.2004 in the

'Sunday Observer, applications were called for the position of Public

Relations and Information Officer on the condition of annual renewal

and subject to the Efficiency Bar Examination on a contract basis for a

year. However, it was mentioned in the appointment letter issued on

01.12.2004 to the said officer that the post is permanent and

pensionable. According to Section 16 of the appointment letter, Mr.

10 Marked IR5.

11 Marked P17.

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 22

Liyanaarachchi has agreed to assume the duties under the specified

conditions. Hence, the salary or benefits of the previous post are

invalidated after receiving this post and are subject to the salary and

other conditions of the new post. Further, it is confirmed by your letter

dated 23.11.2004 that the additional allowance paid to the officers of

your institute, in addition to the salary, has also been paid to this officer.

11. The Petitioner then submitted further appeals to the National Police Commission.12 By

letter dated 18th October 2007,13 the National Police Commission brought the

grievances to the notice of the Director General of Establishment. In response, the

Director General, by letter dated 31st October 2007,14 has only recommended that if

the National Police Commission is of the opinion that the current salary scale allocated

to the Petitioner should be revised, it would be advisable to get the recommendation

of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission. The Director himself opines in the said

letter that the Commission is recommended to consider the Petitioners previous salary

step in coming to a decision regarding the nearest higher step of the salary scale for

the post of Media Officer.

12. Further, as a result of the Petitioners appeal, the Presidential Secretariat, by letter

dated 17th November 2009,15 forwarded the Petitioners appeal to the Secretary of the

National Police Commission and provided direction to correct any injustices suffered

by the Petitioner. Subsequently, the Secretary to the National Police Commission, by

letter dated 23rd November 2009,16 responded by informing the Presidential

Secretariat of steps taken to appoint a Sub-Committee to examine the Petitioners

grievances, the findings of which Below is an extract of the observations within the

report of the said Sub-Committee:17

It is proposed to obtain the approval of the relevant authorities:

a) Place Mr. Liyanarachchi on the salary scale as per the re-

categorization and re-grouping of the post as indicated in the NPC

letter dated 03.06.2007.

b) To make it personal to Mr. Liyanarachchi to rectify the anomaly.

13. The NPC letter dated 06th March 2007 referred to in the Sub-Committees proposal18

was issued by the National Police Commission to seek approval from the Director

General of Establishments to add salary increments to the Petitioners salary in the

MN-4-2006 scale.

14. On the basis of the above report, the Secretary to the National Police Commission

sought approval from the Director General of Establishments by letter dated 17th

February 201019 and from the National Salaries and Cadre Commission by letter dated

30th November 2010 to place the Petitioner on the MN-6-2006 salary scale.20 The

Petitioner has submitted that, as no relief was provided to him, he made further

appeals.21

15. In 2009, upon the new members of the National Police Commission commencing their

term of office, the Commission decided to implement the recommendations of the

Director General of Establishments contained within P21 by letter dated 12th July

2012.22

16. Thereafter, the 8th Respondent presented Commission Paper bearing No. 03/17/2012

to the National Police Commission seeking approval to change the Petitioner

designation to Assistant Director (Public Relations and Media) and to place him at a

higher salary step in salary grade MN-4 in terms of Circular No. 6/2006.23 In the 1st

Respondents affidavit dated 28th October 2013, it has been submitted that such

approval was not granted consideration of the fact that an elevation of the post of

Media Officer to be parallel with that of an Assistant Director and payment of a salary

higher than that prescribed would be contrary to the organisational structure and

approved cadre of the Commission and further that such a course of action would

create a serious anomaly and an unhealthy precedent in the entire public sector.

Thereafter, a second Commission Paper bearing No. 11/38/2012 was presented by the

8th Respondent laying out proposals for, inter alia, the placement of the Petitioner on

a higher salary step on the MN-4 salary scale as well as grant increments to the

Petitioner.24 Following approval for the same, such decision and the approved salary

revisions25 were communicated to the Petitioner via letter issued by the 8th Respondent

and dated 7th December 2012.26

17. However, when such decision was forwarded to the Accounts Division of the National

Police Commission, the Division informed the 8th Respondent by letter dated 19th

December 201227 that the aforementioned decision taken at the 38th Meeting of the

National Police Commission and the contents of P31 were not consistent nor

complementary, and further, by letter dated 30th January 2013 and addressed to the

8th Respondent,28 highlighted the differences between the P30 and P31.

18. Thereafter, a fresh Commission Paper bearing No. 16/48/201329 was presented by the

8th Respondent seeking amendment of the original decision. At the 48th Meeting of

the National Police Commission, the 1st to the 7th Respondents decided to place the

Petitioner on the corresponding salary step of salary scale MN-4 in terms of Public

Administration Circular No. 06/2006 as proposed by P29.

19. Subsequently, however, the Petitioner received a letter dated 11th March 2013 issued

by the 8th Respondent informing him that the afore-stated decision has been

cancelled.30 The Petitioner has submitted that upon further inquiry, he learned that

another Commission Paper bearing No. 19/53/2013 had been presented by the 8th

Respondent at the 53rd meeting of the National Police Commission, during which the

previous approvals within P29 and P34 were withdrawn.31 The Petitioner was informed

by a letter dated 27th March 2013 and issued by the 8th Respondent that the National

Police Commission, at its 53rd meeting, concluded that no injustice had been caused

to the Petitioner.32

20. The Petitioner complains, inter alia, that he has suffered a financial loss as a

consequence of such erroneous application of the present salary scale and that the

decisions taken by the National Police Commission to revise the Petitioners salary at

the 38th and 48th Meetings have been arbitrarily withdrawn without the provision of

reasons for the same. Predominantly, the Petitioner states that he had the legitimate

expectation of being placed on an appropriate salary scale commensurate with his

qualifications, experience and the responsibilities attached to the post.

21. To assess the merits of the Petitioners legitimate expectation, it is paramount first to

appreciate the breadth and applicability of this doctrine.

22. Justice Dehideniya captures the purpose of the doctrine in Zamrath v Sri Lanka

Medical Council 33 and showcases its essential function in safeguarding individuals

from the misuse of discretionary power by administrative authorities, discussing that

when authorities, through their conduct, create legitimate expectations, these

expectations must be honoured to maintain legal certainty and the rule of law. It

follows, therefore, that disregard of such expectations undermines public trust and the

perception of legal reliability, which are fundamental to justice and good governance.

23. In Nimalsiri v. Fernando,34 Justice Jayawardena P.C. expounded the principle of

legitimate expectation as follows:

The doctrine of legitimate expectation applies to situations to protect

legitimate expectation. It arises from establishing an expectation

believing an undertaking or promise given by a public official or

establishing an expectation taking into consideration of established

practices of an authority. However, the said criteria should not be

considered as an exhaustive list as the doctrine of legitimate expectation

has a potential to develop further. Legitimate expectation can be either

based on procedural propriety or on substantive protection.

24. Justice Jayawardena P.C. went on to explain the parameters and contours of the

doctrines applicability as follows:

An expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is founded

upon a promise or practice by the authority that is said to be bound

to fulfil the expectation. Therefore, an expectation reasonably

entertained by a person may not be considered as legitimate because of

some countervailing consideration of policy or law. Further, clear

33 S.C. (FR) 119/2019, SC Minutes of 23rd July 2019.

34 S.C. (F/R) 256/2010, SC Minutes of 17th September 2015.

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 22

statutory words override any expectation howsoever founded. Where an

expectation is founded on a policy and later a relevant change of policy

is notified, the expectation founded on the previous policy cannot be

considered as legitimate.

An expectation the fulfilment of which results in the decision

maker making an unlawful decision cannot be treated as a

legitimate expectation. Therefore, the expectation must be within

the powers of the decision-maker for it to be treated as a

legitimate expectation case. If a person did not expect anything, then

there is nothing that the doctrine can protect.

25. As I will endeavour to explain in the next few paragraphs of my judgment, the

Petitioners case is deficient on two grounds ; the first being that the Petitioner has

failed to establish the foundation of a promise or practice by a public authority that

would bind such public authority to the Petitioners expectation and, the second, that

on the circumstances of the Petitioners change in employment, the expectation

propounded by the Petitioner cannot be lawfully sought to be fulfilled.

26. I observe a surprisingly notable failure to appreciate that the Petitioners purported

expectation is based on a misunderstanding of the circumstances of his recruitment to

the National Police Commission. As narrated above, the Petitioner attended two

interviews for the two distinct positions Public Relations and Information Officer and

Media Officer to the National Police Commission. The process undertaken by the

Petitioner to change his employment would also be equally distinct. More precisely,

should the Petitioner have been recruited as a Public Relations and Information Officer

following the first interview by letter of appointment P7, the Petitioner would rightly

be entitled to an additional 33% increase in his salary, having obtained release on

secondment from the Ministry of Public Administration. In actuality, the Petitioner was

called for a second interview and offered the role of Media Officer to the National

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 22

Police Commission, which necessitated a permanent release from his previous position

and appointment of his new post on a permanent basis, as opposed to a secondment.

27. In fact, this is the explanation provided by the Director General of Establishments in

1R4 in refusing approval sought by the National Police Commission to add salary

increments to the Petitioners salary scale. The Director General states:

,

VII 9:8:3

.

A translation of the above reads as follows,

Please be informed that since this officer has served in a position with

a higher salary scale than that prescribed for the Media Officer, he shall

be paid under Section 9:8:3 of Chapter VII of the Establishments Code

after he is fully released from his previous post and appointed to the post

of Media Officer on a permanent basis.

28. The relevant section of the Establishment Code referred to is reproduced below:

9:8:3

, (9:3 9:4 )

.

A translation of the above reads as follows:

9:8:3 No officer, appointed to a post inferior to that which be held

previously, should be paid more than what he would have been paid had

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 22

all his service (admissible under sub sections 9:3 and 9:4) been in the

inferior post.

29. This is also reiterated in the preliminary response to the Petitioners appeal by the

National Salaries and Cadre Commission, P17, where the Secretary to the Commission

reasons, which is once again reproduced below:

16

. .

, .

,

2004.11.23 .

A translation of the above reads as follows,

According to Section 16 of the appointment letter, Mr. Liyanaarachchi

has agreed to assume the duties under the specified conditions. Hence,

the salary or benefits of the previous post are invalidated after receiving

this post and are subject to the salary and other conditions of the new

post. Further, it is confirmed by your letter dated 23.11.2004 that the

additional allowance paid to the officers of your institute, in addition to

the salary, has also been paid to this officer.

30. Letter of appointment P7 explicitly makes reference to the salary drawn by the

Petitioner in his previous employment as a Grade 1 Officer of the Translators Service

and guarantees a percentage increase relative to such salary. As opposed to P7, letter

of appointment P9 states:

11. The post carries a salary of Rs. 101,700/- per annum rising to Rs.

142,200 per annum by fifteen increments of Rs. 2700/- per annum. (This

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 22

salary is to be revised and will be notified to you in due course). In

addition to this salary, approved allowances will be paid.

31. As demonstrated in P13, the salary was appropriately revised in accordance with the

Public Administration Circular No. 09/2004, placing the Petitioner on the salary scale

TB 5-1 in concurrence with the Petitioners commencement date as Media Officer.

32. I cannot, therefore, infer any legitimacy to the Petitioners purported expectation that

the salary scale attached to his post as a Media Officer should match or surpass that

of his previous post as a Grade 1 Translator.

33. In fact, it is crucial to draw a clear line between a legitimate expectation worthy of

protection by law in contrast to a mere hope or aspiration. In Desmond Perera and

Others v. Karunaratne, Commissioner of National Housing and Others,35 the Court

of Appeal established that,

[A] hope does not fall into the category of a legitimate expectation

which has been defined as a right or interest which is looked forward to

by a person. The principle entrenched in administrative law regarding

legitimate exception is the "right to be heard". A hope does not create a

legitimate expectation in law.

34. In Vavuniya Solar Power v. Ceylon Electricity Board,36 Justice Kodagoda, in

agreement with the above view in Desmond Perera and Others v Karunatne (supra),

states,

In order to successfully claim relief on the basis of a legitimate

expectation that has been frustrated, the claimant must establish that

35 (1994) 3 Sri L.R. 316.

36 S.C. (F/R) 172/2017

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 22

the representation made by the public authority or its past conduct

generated an expectation which is justiciable in the eyes of the law.

35. In the same case, Kodagoda J. also states that, with regard to the legitimacy of an

expectation arising from a public authority's representation or past practice, the law

considers only the expectation a person is entitled to develop, not the subjective

expectation actually held; the key question is what expectation the person was legally

entitled to develop based on the public authority's representation or conduct.

36. The Petitioner relies quite strongly on the argument that he was only agreeable to

accept the post of Media Officer on the condition that his remuneration would be

equivalent to or higher than that of a Grade 1 Translator. Thus, in his view, it is contrary

to his legitimate expectation to be placed on the salary scale MN-4 inasmuch as a

Grade I Translator would be paid according to the higher salary scale MN-6. However,

the Petitioner is attempting to ride two horses with one saddle; this approach

disregards the established legal framework and the objective standards for legitimate

expectation, attempting to blend subjective hope with legal entitlement

inappropriately. The precedent clearly differentiates between legitimate expectations

rooted in law and mere aspirations, thereby invalidating the Petitioner's claim.

37. On a somewhat similar line of argument, the Petitioner has attempted to persuade this

Court that he was entitled to be placed in Salary Scale SL-1-2006 in terms of the

revisions brought about by Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 which would

place him on equal footing with an Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative

Development by reason that the post of Media Officer belongs to the Staff Officer

category of the Circular. However, the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent dated 28th

October 2013 rightly identifies that the Salary Scale SL-1-2006 is applicable to the post

of the above-mentioned Assistant Commissioner by virtue of explicit instructions in

Annexure III of the said Circular. I find no legal basis to extend the afore-mentioned

salary scale to the post of the Petitioner nor equate the Petitioners post to that of the

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

S.C. (F/R) 123/2013 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 22

Assistant Commissioner as the Circular is devoid of any explicit reference to the post

of Media Officer.

38. The Petitioner, being aware of the fact that a Scheme of Recruitment did not exist for

the post of Media Officer, accepted such employment with this knowledge. In my

estimation, the Petitioner has chosen his path and must now tread it faithfully. One

cannot gallivant into a new job and expect the old perks to followit simply defies

practicality and the logical order of things.

39. In the Petitioners written submissions, the below extract is quoted from Wade and

Forsyths Administrative Law37 textbook:

"When a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure, it

is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and

should implement its promise, so long as implementation does not

interfere with its statutory duty.

40. This statement is, indeed, fundamentally sound; it underscores the principle that the

doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot override a public authoritys statutory duty.

It is, in fact, a caveat to the doctrine of legitimate expectation that where such

expectation would interfere with a public authoritys statutory duty, it is no longer, and

never was, legitimate. In the event the Petitioner was granted a higher pay scale

contrary to the salary scale administered by the circulars and the Scheme of

Recruitment, the National Salaries and Cadre Commission would be in breach of its

statutory duty.

41. The foundation of the Petitioners claim rests on a promise that was never explicitly

made, nor legally binding. It is a common misconception that the mere act of

communicating a condition equates to its acceptance by the employer, especially

when the final terms and conditions of employment, as reflected in the appointment

letter, do not corroborate such a condition. It is pertinent to note that the principle of

legitimate expectation serves as a safeguard against arbitrary and capricious

administrative actions. It ensures that individuals who have been led to believe,

through the words or actions of a public authority, that certain procedures or benefits

will be granted are not disappointed without good reason. However, in this instance,

the Petitioner's expectation is built on a precarious foundation of personal assumption

rather than a substantive promise or practice by the National Police Commission. While

a powerful tool for ensuring administrative fairness, the doctrine of legitimate

expectation cannot be stretched to encompass subjective hopes that are not anchored

in an explicit promise or established practice.

42. It cannot be ignored that the Petitioner has received inconsistent directions in

response to his various appeals from a diverse range of public officials and bodies.

Ultimately, however, at the apex of the decision-making process sits the Public Service

Commission, which primarily bears responsibility and wields authority over all facets

of the affairs of public officers, including salary scales. In appropriate circumstances,

this responsibility is administered via subordinate bodies such as the National Salaries

and Cadre Commission and codified in instruments such as circulars and schemes of

recruitment. Compliance with such standards and directions is imperative; any

deviations would jeopardise the carefully constructed, albeit at times admittedly

tenuous, administrative framework.

43. The correspondence between the Petitioner and various public officials, although

reflecting a certain level of administrative ambiguity, does not suffice to establish a

binding promise or an actionable breach of duty. It is a well-settled principle that

administrative efficiency and procedural propriety do not automatically translate into

a legal entitlement, especially when the statutory framework dictates otherwise.

44. On the above facts, circumstances and analysis, I find that the Petitioner has failed to

establish a violation of his fundamental rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution

by one or more of the Respondents.

Application Dismissed.
