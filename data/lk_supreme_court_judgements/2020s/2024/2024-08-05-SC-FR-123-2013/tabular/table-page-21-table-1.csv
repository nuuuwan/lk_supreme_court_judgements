"","S. Thurairaja, P.C., J."
"","when the final terms and conditions of employment, as reflected in the appointment"
"","letter, do not corroborate such a condition. It is pertinent to note that the principle of"
"","legitimate  expectation 
serves  as  a 
safeguard  against  arbitrary  and  capricious"
"","administrative  actions.  It  ensures  that  individuals  who  have  been  led  to  believe,"
"","through the words or actions of a public authority, that certain procedures or benefits"
"","will be granted are not disappointed without good reason. However, in this instance,"
"","the Petitioner's expectation is built on a precarious foundation of personal assumption"
"","rather than a substantive promise or practice by the National Police Commission. While"
"","a  powerful  tool 
for  ensuring  administrative 
fairness, 
the  doctrine  of 
legitimate"
"","expectation cannot be stretched to encompass subjective hopes that are not anchored"
"","in an explicit promise or established practice."
"42.","It  cannot  be 
ignored  that  the  Petitioner  has  received 
inconsistent  directions 
in"
"","response to  his various appeals  from a diverse range  of public officials and bodies."
"","Ultimately, however, at the apex of the decision-making process sits the Public Service"
"","Commission, which primarily bears responsibility and wields authority over all facets"
"","of the affairs of public officers, including salary scales. In appropriate circumstances,"
"","this responsibility is administered via subordinate bodies such as the National Salaries"
"","and Cadre Commission and codified in instruments such as circulars and schemes of"
"","recruitment.  Compliance  with  such  standards  and  directions 
is 
imperative;  any"
"","deviations  would  jeopardise  the  carefully  constructed,  albeit  at  times  admittedly"
"","tenuous, administrative framework."
"43.","The  correspondence  between  the  Petitioner  and  various  public  officials,  although"
"","reflecting a  certain  level  of administrative ambiguity, does not suffice to  establish a"
"","binding  promise  or  an  actionable  breach  of  duty.  It  is  a  well-settled  principle  that"
"","administrative efficiency and procedural propriety do not automatically translate into"
"","a legal entitlement, especially when the statutory framework dictates otherwise."
