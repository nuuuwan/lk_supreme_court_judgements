"18.","Thereafter, a fresh Commission Paper bearing No. 16/48/201329 was presented by the"
"","8th Respondent seeking amendment of the original decision. At the 48th Meeting of"
"","the National Police Commission, the 1st to the 7th Respondents decided to place the"
"","Petitioner  on  the  corresponding salary  step of  salary scale MN-4  in  terms  of Public"
"","Administration Circular No. 06/2006 as proposed by P29."
"19.","Subsequently, however, the Petitioner received a letter dated 11th March 2013 issued"
"","by  the  8th  Respondent 
informing  him  that  the  afore-stated  decision  has  been"
"","cancelled.30  The Petitioner  has  submitted  that  upon  further  inquiry,  he  learned  that"
"","another  Commission  Paper  bearing  No.  19/53/2013  had  been  presented  by  the  8th"
"","Respondent at the 53rd meeting of the National Police Commission, during which the"
"","previous approvals within P29 and P34 were withdrawn.31 The Petitioner was informed"
"","by a letter dated 27th March 2013 and issued by the 8th Respondent that the National"
"","Police Commission, at its 53rd meeting, concluded that no injustice had been caused"
"","to the Petitioner.32"
"20.","The  Petitioner  complains, 
inter  alia,  that  he  has  suffered  a 
financial 
loss  as  a"
"","consequence of such  erroneous application of the present salary scale and that the"
"","decisions taken by the National Police Commission to revise the Petitioner’s salary at"
"","the 38th and 48th Meetings have been arbitrarily withdrawn without the provision of"
"","reasons for the same. Predominantly, the Petitioner states that he had the legitimate"
"","expectation  of  being  placed  on  an  appropriate  salary  scale  commensurate  with  his"
"","qualifications, experience and the responsibilities attached to the post."
"21.","To assess the merits of the Petitioner’s legitimate expectation, it is paramount first to"
"","appreciate the breadth and applicability of this doctrine."
