"","the  representation  made  by  the  public  authority  or  its  past  conduct"

"","expectation arising from a public authority's representation or past practice, the law"
"","considers  only  the  expectation  a  person  is  entitled  to  develop,  not  the  subjective"
"","expectation actually held; the key question is what expectation the person was legally"
"","entitled to develop based on the public authority's representation or conduct."
"36.","The  Petitioner  relies  quite  strongly  on  the  argument  that  he  was  only  agreeable  to"
"","accept  the  post  of  Media  Officer  on  the  condition  that  his  remuneration  would  be"
"","equivalent to or higher than that of a Grade 1 Translator. Thus, in his view, it is contrary"
"","to  his  legitimate  expectation  to  be  placed  on  the  salary  scale  MN-4  inasmuch  as  a"
"","Grade I Translator would be paid according to the higher salary scale MN-6. However,"
"","the  Petitioner  is  attempting  to  “ride  two  horses  with  one  saddle”;  this  approach"
"","disregards the established legal framework and the objective standards for legitimate"

to

entitlement"
"","inappropriately. The precedent clearly differentiates between legitimate expectations"
"","rooted in law and mere aspirations, thereby invalidating the Petitioner's claim."
