Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District Court

of Kuliyapitiya on 26.12.2007 seeking cancellation of the deed of gift No.

14869 dated 12.10.2002 on the basis that the said deed was executed by

the plaintiffs late father in favour of the defendant under undue influence

and threats by the latter. The defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiffs

action on the basis that it was a voluntary act of the donor. After trial,

the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs action. On appeal, the High

Court of Civil Appeal affirmed the judgment of the District Court. The

plaintiff appealed to this Court from the judgment of the High Court.

According to the uncontradictory evidence led in the inter partes trial in

the divorce case between the plaintiffs father and the mother (V1), the

plaintiffs mother left the matrimonial home on 23.12.1972. By judgment

dated 16.03.2000, the District Court had granted the divorce in favour of

the plaintiffs father on the ground of malicious desertion on part of the

plaintiffs mother. The father had paid a sum of Rs. 2,500,000 as ex gratia

payment to the mother. At the inquiry before the Magistrate into the

death of the plaintiffs father, the plaintiffs mother had testified that she

left the matrimonial home in 1973.

At the trial in the instant case, the plaintiff in her evidence stated that

the defendant had been living with the plaintiffs father since 1985 as his

mistress. She further stated that approximately 2-3 months after the

defendants arrival, her father expelled the plaintiffs mother from the

matrimonial home, and the plaintiff also accompanied the mother.

This evidence of the defendant is contrary to the unchallenged evidence

led in the parents divorce case. I must emphasise that the divorce trial

was not ex parte but inter partes where the plaintiffs mother was

represented by a lawyer.

4

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

The impugned deed had been executed on 12.10.2002 after entering the

judgment in the divorce case on 16.03.2000 but before the decree nisi

was made absolute. The plaintiffs father got married to the defendant on

02.05.2003 after the decree nisi was made absolute. There was no

rationale for exerting undue influence on the plaintiffs father to execute

the deed in favour of the defendant because by that time the divorce

proceedings had practically concluded without any opposition from the

plaintiffs mother, who had also received a significant sum of money as

ex gratia payment.

The plaintiffs father died on 16.05.2006. If the defendant started living

with the plaintiffs father as husband and wife from 1985, executing the

impugned deed in favour of the defendant in 2002 does not raise

suspicion at all.

The evidence of other witnesses called by the plaintiff including the

Buddhist priest in the village temple does not support the plaintiffs story.

The evidence of the priest is that, from the time the priest came to the

temple, the plaintiffs father and the defendant lived in harmony as

husband and wife for about 16 years.

The plaintiff states that her father died under suspicious circumstances.

At the trial, the plaintiff raised issues on this point. This is not directly

relevant to the matter to be resolved in this case. The matter in issue in

this case is whether the deed was executed under undue influence or

threats and not whether the plaintiffs father died under suspicious

circumstances. However, the verdict of the inquirer into sudden deaths

dated 16.05.2006, and the verdict of the Magistrate dated 11.07.2007,

do not indicate any foul play. The plaintiffs father was 65 years old at

the time of his death, which was attributed to liver failure due to

cirrhosis. The death was declared a natural death. The plaintiffs primary

grievance is that despite the coroners order to bury the deceaseds body,

5

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

it was cremated. The Magistrates Court dealt with this matter and the

defendant was punished according to law. That does not warrant the deed

to be declared invalid.

The plaintiff states in her evidence that the deed was executed under

death threats. However, there is not even a police complaint made about

death threats or any family dispute, either by the deceased father or by

the plaintiff herself.

In short, there is no evidence acceptable to Court to prove undue

influence or death threats. The judgment of the District Court is purely

based on evidence. Both the District Court and the High Court have

analysed the evidence in detail before dismissing the plaintiffs action.

There is no necessity to repeat the analysis of evidence in this judgment.

This Court has granted leave to appeal on the questions of law as stated

in paragraph 16(ii)-(vi) of the petition. At the argument, learned counsel

for the plaintiff-appellant stated that he would not pursue the question

in paragraph 16(iii) of the petition. Let me now consider this appeal in

light of the questions of law raised by the plaintiff-appellant.

16(ii). Has the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in law in holding that the

father of the plaintiff could transfer the rights of the entire property

when the mother of the plaintiffs father was alive?

The plaintiffs father seems to have derived title to the property from the

paternal inheritance. Learned counsel for the plaintiff raises this question

to suggest that the plaintiffs father was not the sole owner of the land

conveyed by the impugned deed. This assertion is based on the premise

that when the plaintiffs grandfather died, his wife, the plaintiffs

grandmother, was alive, and therefore, one half of the land should belong

to the widow.

6

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

In the District Court, the plaintiff presented the case on the basis that

the plaintiffs father was the sole owner of the land. The plaintiff

maintained the same position even before the High Court. The plaintiff

cannot take up a new position for the first time before the Supreme Court,

which is not a question of law but a question of fact.

A party to an action is bound by specific constraints regarding the

presentation of his case. Firstly, a party cannot, by way of issues, present

a case different from what was pleaded in his pleadings. Secondly, once

issues are raised and accepted by Court, a party cannot present a

different case at the trial from what was already raised by way of issues.

Thirdly, once the judgment is pronounced by the trial Court, the losing

party cannot present a different case before the appellate Court from

what was presented in the lower Courts, unless the new ground is on a

pure question of law and not on a question of fact or on a mixed question

of fact and law.

These rules seem to have universal application when the decisions of

other jurisdictions are considered.

In Mokweni and Others v. Plaatjies and Others [2023] ZAWCHC 266,

Nziweni J. in the High Court of South Africa stated at paragraph 17:

Undoubtedly, raising an entirely new issue for the first time on

appeal is something to be frowned on. This is because, it is well

settled that appellate courts do not decide any issue that was not

raised in the court a quo. The upshot of this is that a party cannot

raise an issue on appeal that was not raised in the court

a quo unless it is a pure question of law. Hence, a party must seek

leave of the appellate court to introduce a new issue on appeal.

7

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

The Indian Supreme Court has followed the same practice. In Chitturi

Subbanna v. Kudapa Subbanna & Others 1965 AIR 1325, Mudholkar J.

declared:

It is right and proper that parties to a litigation should not be

permitted to set up the grounds of their claims or defence in driblets

or at different stages and embarrass the opponents. Considerations

of public policy require that a successful party should not, at the

appellate stage, be faced with new grounds of attack after having

repulsed the original ones. The proper function of an appellate court

is to correct an error in the judgment or proceedings of the court

below and not to adjudicate upon a different kind of a dispute that

was never taken before the court below. It is only in exceptional

cases that the appellate court may in its discretion allow a new point

to be raised before it provided there are good grounds for allowing it

to be raised and no prejudice is caused thereby to the opponent of

the party permitted to raise such point.

In Jones v. MBNA International Bank [2000] EWCA Civ 514, Peter Gibson

L.J. elucidated the rationale underlying these rules while summarising

the English law on the matter at para 38:

It is not in dispute that to withdraw a concession or take a point not

argued in the lower court requires the leave of this court. In general

the court expects each party to advance his whole case at the trial.

In the interests of fairness to the other party this court should be

slow to allow new points, which were available to be taken at the

trial but were not taken, to be advanced for the first time in this court.

That consideration is the weightier if further evidence might have

been adduced at the trial, had the point been taken then, or if the

decision on the point requires an evaluation of all the evidence and

could be affected by the impression which the trial judge receives

8

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

from seeing and hearing the witnesses. Indeed it is hard to see how,

if those circumstances obtained, this court, having regard to the

overriding objective of dealing with cases justly, could allow that

new point to be taken.

The same approach was adopted by the High Court of Australia in Water

Board v. Moustaka (1988) 62 ALJR 209 where Chief Justice Mason and

Justices Wilson, Brennan and Dawson, after a careful consideration of

precedent on the matter held at para 13:

More than once it has been held by this Court that a point cannot be

raised for the first time upon appeal when it could possibly have

been met by calling evidence below. Where all the facts have been

established beyond controversy or where the point is one of

construction or of law, then a court of appeal may find it expedient

and in the interests of justice to entertain the point, but otherwise

the rule is strictly applied.

In the Sri Lankan context, the proposition that a question of fact can be

raised for the first time in appeal is mainly based on the old decision of

the House of Lords in The Tasmania (1890) 15 App. Cases 223 at 225

where Lord Herschell stated:

It appears to me that under these circumstances, a Court of Appeal

ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put

forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that it

has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as

completely as would have been the case if the controversy had

arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could

have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned, if an

opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the

witness box.

9

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

In the Supreme Court case of Appuhamy v. Nona (1912) 15 NLR 311 at

312, Justice Pereira raised some doubt about the acceptability of the

above position in the context of procedure we adopt in Sri Lanka where

a civil trial is conducted on identified issues. His Lordship stated that a

new point could be entertained in appeal if it might have been put

forward in the Court below under some one or other of the issues framed.

I am not sure that this ruling would apply to a system of procedure

in which the framing of issues at the trial is an essential step except

to the extent of admitting a new contention urged for the first time in

the Court of Appeal, which, though not taken at the trial, is still

admissible under some one or other of the issues framed. Under our

procedure all the contentious matter between the parties to a civil

suit is, so to say, focused in the issues of law and fact framed.

Whatever is not involved in the issues is to be taken as admitted by

one party or the other, and I do not think that under our procedure it

is open to a party to put forward a ground for the first time in appeal

unless it might have been put forward in the Court below under some

one or other of the issues framed, and when such a ground, that is

to say, a ground that might have been put forward in the Court

below, is put forward in appeal for the first time, the cautions

indicated in the case of the Tasmania may well be observed.

Justice Pereira did not entertain the question of fact raised for the first

time in that appeal.

The cumulative effect of these two leading decisions (i.e. The Tasmania

and Appuhamy v. Nona) is that a question of fact can be raised for the

first time in appeal if:

(a) it might have been put forward in the Court below under some one

or other of the issues framed; and

10

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

(b) if it is satisfied beyond doubt that

(i) it [the appellate Court] has before it all the facts bearing upon

the new contention, as completely as would have been the

case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and

(ii) no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those

whose conduct is impugned, if an opportunity for explanation

had been afforded them when in the witness box.

Later cases such as Arulampikai v. Thambu (1944) 45 NLR 457, Setha v.

Weerakoon (1948) 49 NLR 225, Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini Senanayake

[1992] 2 Sri LR 180 at 191, Somawathie v. Wilmon (supra) followed the

above two decisions.

In Leechman Co. Ltd v. Rangalle Consolidated [1981] 2 Sri LR 373, Justice

Soza stated at page 391:

Where the point depends upon a question of fact which is disputed

and should be determined on evidence, then it cannot be taken up

for the first time in appeal unless the facts necessary for the

determination appear in the evidence and are not in dispute at all.

The plaintiff in the instant appeal has not satisfied the above requisites

in order for this Court to entertain the new points of facts raised for the

first time on appeal.

16(iv). Has the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in law in holding that the

plaintiff has failed to establish that the impugned deed was

executed under undue influence and threats exerted by the

defendant on the plaintiffs father?

Through this question of law, learned counsel for the plaintiff took pains

to present a different argument in terms of the burden of proof for the

first time before the Supreme Court. The trial in the District Court

11

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

proceeded on the basis that the burden of proof of undue influence was

on the plaintiff. When reading the written submissions filed before the

High Court and the judgment of the High Court, it is abundantly clear

that the plaintiff maintained the same position in the High Court. The

plaintiffs argument before the High Court was that, notwithstanding the

fact that she proved undue influence in the execution of the deed, the

District Court held otherwise.

However, learned counsel for the plaintiff referring to section 111 of the

Evidence Ordinance argues for the first time before this Court that the

defendant was in a position of active confidence, and therefore the burden

of proving the good faith of the execution of the deed falls on the

defendant. In other words, learned counsel submits that the burden was

on the defendant to prove the negative; namely, that she did not exercise

undue influence on the plaintiffs father in the execution of the deed.

This in my view is not a pure question of law but a mixed question of fact

and law because in order to shift the burden as counsel for the plaintiff

now suggests, there are prerequisites to be met by the plaintiff.

In this case, at the commencement of the trial, the execution of the deed

was recorded as a formal admission.

Thereafter, the plaintiff raised issues on the basis that the plaintiffs

father died under suspicious circumstances mainly because of the

cremation instead of burial, which I have already stated, is irrelevant to

decide the main issue in this case.

Thereafter the plaintiff raised issues on the basis that the deed was

executed under undue influence and death threats.

Once the due execution of the deed, in terms of section 2 of the Prevention

of Frauds Ordinance, No. 7 of 1840, as amended, is admitted, the general

12

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

principle is that, the burden shifts to the opposing party to prove undue

influence, fraud, conspiracy, coercion, or any other ground he relies upon

to invalidate the deed.

If the plaintiffs position was that the burden of proof of the negative was

on the defendant, she ought to have presented the case in the trial Court

in that manner. This was not done. The concept of fair trial demands it.

The administration of justice is not a game of strategy but rather a solemn

and earnest pursuit to uncover the truth.

In any event, both parties had led evidence at the trial: the plaintiff led

evidence that there was undue influence and the defendant led evidence

to prove that there was no undue influence. The District Court and the

High Court accepted the defendants version. On the facts and

circumstances of this case, there is no reason for this Court to interfere

with that finding.

16(v). Could the issue No. 21 and 22 be answered in favour of the

defendant in the circumstances of this case?

The issue No. 21 was whether the impugned deed was executed by the

plaintiffs father voluntarily. The issue No. 22 was whether the defendant

is entitled to the reliefs sought in the answer.

After analysing the evidence, the District Court has answered these two

issues in the affirmative and the High Court has affirmed it. Learned

counsel for the plaintiff does not explain how the analysis of evidence

made by the District Court, which was affirmed by the High Court, is

perverse.

16(vi). Has the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in law by not considering

the evidence in the correct perspective?

13

SC/APPEAL/47/2017

In view of the forgoing analysis, this question must be answered in the

negative.

The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is affirmed and the appeal

is dismissed. The defendant is entitled to costs in all three Courts.
