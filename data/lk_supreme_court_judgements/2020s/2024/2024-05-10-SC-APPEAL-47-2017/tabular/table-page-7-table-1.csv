"Subbanna v. Kudapa Subbanna & Others 1965 AIR 1325, Mudholkar J."
"declared:"
"It  is  right  and  proper  that  parties  to  a  litigation  should  not  be"
"permitted to set up the grounds of their claims or defence in driblets"
"or at different stages and embarrass the opponents. Considerations"
"of  public  policy  require  that  a  successful  party  should  not,  at  the"
"appellate stage, be faced with new grounds of attack after having"
"repulsed the original ones. The proper function of an appellate court"
"is  to  correct  an  error  in  the  judgment  or  proceedings  of  the  court"
"below and not to adjudicate upon a different kind of a dispute that"
"was  never  taken  before  the  court  below.  It  is  only  in  exceptional"
"cases that the appellate court may in its discretion allow a new point"
"to be raised before it provided there are good grounds for allowing it"
"to be raised and no prejudice is caused thereby to the opponent of"
"the party permitted to raise such point."
