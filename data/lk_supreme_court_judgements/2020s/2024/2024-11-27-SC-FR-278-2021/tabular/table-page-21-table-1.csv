"40) In order for a person to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Fundamental"
"Rights  Application,  the  Petitioner  must  establish  the  requirements  contained  in"
"Article 126 of the Constitution which reads that where any person alleges that his/"
"her fundamental rights have been infringed, in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the"
"Supreme court, such fundamental rights should be ‘infringed’ or infringement should"
"be 
‘imminent’.  In  the  present  case,  at  the  time  the  Petitioner  had  invoked  the"
"jurisdiction of this Court, his fundamental right to the equal protection of the law was"
"neither ‘infringed’ nor was it imminent that his fundamental right to equal protection"
"of  the  law  was  to  be  infringed  by  1st  to  the  3rd  Respondents. 
  Further,  the  1st"
"Respondent had not caused any inordinate delay that would amount to an implicit"
"refusal, 
in  responding  to  the  Petitioner’s  requests.  Therefore, 
in  my  view,  this"
"Fundamental Rights Application of the Petitioner is premature. In this context, further"
"analysis  on  whether  the  Petitioner’s  fundamental  right  under  Article  12(1),  of  the"
"Constitution has been infringed is irrelevant."
