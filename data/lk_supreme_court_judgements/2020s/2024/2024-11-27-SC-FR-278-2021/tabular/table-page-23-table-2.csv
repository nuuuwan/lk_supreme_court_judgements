"Is the Petitioner similarly circumstanced to that of the recipients of Lots 244, 255, 260, 276"
"and 290 depicted in the Cadastral Map?"
"This Court arrived at a finding that titles in respect of Lots Nos. 244, 255, 260, 276,"
"and  290,  have  been  transferred  to  total  outsiders  who  had  not  been  long-term"
"occupants of such land blocks. It further found that the consideration charged in"
"respect of Lots Nos. 279, 282, and 283, exceeds the amount permitted by the policy"
"of the municipality. Thus, the 1st Respondent municipality had taken an arbitrary"
"route in vesting titles to the above lands by unhesitatingly deviating from its own"
"policy."
