P.Padman Surasena J:

According to the amended Plaint (dated 01-10-2003), the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) had instituted the instant action against the 1st

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Defendant),

the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd

Defendant), the 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the 3rd Defendant), and the 4th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 4th Defendant or Pradeshiya Sabha of Galiamuwa). As the 3rd Defendant

had passed away his wife Ganthota Karangalage Nandawathie has been added as (3a)

Defendant-Respondent-Respondent. The Plaintiff in his action has prayed inter alia for the

following relief:

(a) A declaration that he is the owner of the land more-fully set out in the schedule to

the Plaint,

(b) A declaration that he is entitled to a judgment demarcating the eastern boundary

of Lot 3 in Plan No. 6053/PA and also in terms of Plan No. 2143 dated 25-05-2003,

(c) A permanent injunction preventing the Defendants from disputing the demarcation

of the boundary.

The Plaintiff, according to the amended Plaint, states that he is the lawful owner of the land

more-fully described in the schedule to the amended Plaint. According to the said schedule

this land is Lot 3 in extent of 3 Roods and 13.34 Perches (: 03, :13.34) which is depicted

in the Plan No. 6053/PA dated 15-11-1975 prepared by L. A. D. C. Wijetunga Licensed

Surveyor. The said Plan is the Final Plan prepared for the partition case No. 18733 in the

District Court of Kegalle. The boundaries to said Lot 3 according to the schedule to the

amended Plaint are as follows:

- To the north Veralugollena

- To the east a footpath

- To the south Lot X, Lot Y and Lot No. 04

- To the west Lot No. 2

Indeed, according to the Plaintiff, the District Court of Kegalle in the said partition action had

allotted the said Lot 3 to Godayalage Lafi who stood as the 6th Defendant to that partition

action. It is thereafter that the Plaintiff had purchased said Lot 3 from aforesaid Godayalage

Lafi through the Deed No. 3575 attested by Earl Dunstant Milroy Jayawardhena Notary Public

on 06-07-1997.

According to the Plaint, the roadway situated in the eastern boundary of this land had been

in existence as a footpath in Plan No. 6053/PA dated 15-11-1975. The position taken up by

(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 4 of 8

the Plaintiff in his amended Plaint is that the 1st and 2nd Defendants on or around 12-09-2000

had widened the said footpath to make it a four feet wide roadway by encroaching upon the

Plaintiffs eastern boundary without his permission. It was the position of the Plaintiff on the

Plaint that he had thereafter restored his boundary fence to its previous position by making a

fence using about 20 concrete posts on or about 25-08-2002.

The Plaintiff has thereafter stated in the Plaint that on about 26-08-2002 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants had removed the concrete fence he had installed on his eastern boundary. He

also has stated that on 28-08-2002, an officer from Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha had come

to the scene and told him that he had to take his boundary about 1 foot backwards to make

the correct width of the road. It is in that backdrop that the Plaintiff had alleged that the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Defendants had encroached upon his eastern boundary and widened this roadway

on 28-08-2002.

At this stage, it is relevant to peruse the Plan No. 2143 dated 25-05-2003. In this Plan, the

alleged encroached portion (by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants) has been depicted as Lot 1.

The cause of action of the Plaintiff was on the basis that he is entitled to demarcate his

boundary in accordance with the eastern boundary of Lot 3 in Plan No. 6053/PA.

1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants have denied the positions taken up by the Plaintiff and taken up

the following positions in their joint answer:

(i) The roadway relevant to this case which is Alawala-Egodadeniya Road has

been in existence for a long time initially as a by-lane which was later widened

into a 8 feet wide roadway.

(ii) The villagers had continuously and regularly used this roadway for a long time.

The roadway was such that even the tractors had been travelling on that road.

(iii) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants along with the other villagers had been using

this 8-feet-wide road since about the year 1980 and as such they have acquired

a prescriptive right to use this as a common roadway of the village.

(iv) Despite the fact that this road was a 8 feet wide roadway, the Plaintiff by

misrepresenting facts, had attempted to extend his boundary by making the

said roadway narrower than the existing 8 feet.

(v) The Defendants have admitted that the rest of the land is owned and possessed

by the Plaintiff.

(vi) Even the Plaintiff is using the same road which is 8 feet wide, to access his

land.

(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 5 of 8

(vii) When the Plaintiff had obstructed this roadway by extending his eastern

boundary, the 1st Defendant on 25-08-2002 had lodged a complaint to

Pindeniya Police Station

The 4th Defendant, Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, in its answer, had taken up the position

that the roadway relevant to this action is a roadway, which is 3.65 Metres wide and it is

owned and maintained by the 4th Defendant. The 4th Defendant had relied on the Gazette

dated 18-06-1993 and the Gazette dated 26-01-2001 to establish this fact.

The trial in the District Court had proceeded on 26 issues. At the end of the trial, the learned

District Judge by his judgment dated 07-03-2019, had concluded the followings:

(i) The Plaintiff has established his paper title to the land described in the schedule

to the Plaint.

(ii) The Plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for in the other prayers as the

Plaintiff had failed to properly identify his land.

(iii) The roadway more-fully depicted in the Plan No. 4818 dated 25-10-2004

produced marked 1V1, has been a road which is 8 feet wide; the said roadway

has been used in that manner for a long time; the said roadway is a roadway

owned and maintained by Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 07-03-2019 pronounced by the District Court of

Kegalle, the Plaintiff had appealed to the Provincial High Court. After the argument, the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals for the reasons set out in its judgment, had proceeded

to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge and allowed the appeal.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals, the 1st

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant sought Special Leave to Appeal from this Court. This Court,

upon hearing the learned counsel for the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant and the learned

counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent, by its order dated 13-10-2022, had granted

Leave to Appeal on the following questions of law:

a. Is the impugned judgment dated 10-09-2020 erroneous and contrary to law?

d. Did the Learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals fail to consider and

appreciate the evidence produced in case bearing No. 6853/L in the District

Court of Kegalle?

f. Did the Learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals fail to consider and

appreciate the inconvenience caused to the villagers using the road relevant

to the said application by setting aside the judgment of the District Court in

case bearing No. 6853/L?

(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 6 of 8

Perusal of Plan No. 6053/PA shows clearly the presence of a roadway along the eastern

boundary of Lot 3. The said Plan had identified that roadway as a footpath ().

However, the plan does not give the width of that roadway. According to the Gazette dated

18-06-1993, the width of this road is mentioned as 2 meters which is approximately about

6.56 feet. According to the Gazette No. 1188 dated 08-06-2001, the 4th Respondent

Pradeshiya Sabha, in terms of section 24 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 has

declared that this road is a 3.65 meter (approximately 12 feet) wide road owned and

maintained by Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha. The said Gazette notification had called for any

objections by the owners of the lands relevant to this roadway within one month.

The District court had issued a commission on the Licensed Surveyor K.S. Panditharatne to

prepare a plan pertaining to this roadway which was to be pointed out by the Defendants.

The said surveyor (K.S. Panditharatne) had accordingly prepared Plan No. 4818 dated 25-10-

2004 produced marked 1 V1. The report submitted by the said surveyor was produced marked

1 V1 ().

The Licensed Surveyor Robert Perera was called to give evidence by the Plaintiff. The

commission issued on him by the District Court was to superimpose the eastern boundary of

Lot No. 03 in Plan No. 6053/PA. The Plan, the Licensed Surveyor Robert Perera has prepared

is Plan No. 2143 dated 25-05-2000. This Plan has been produced marked P2 in the District

Court. He has gone to survey the land on 24-05-2003. It is his evidence that the relevant

roadway was easily identifiable on the ground along the eastern boundary of Plaintiffs land

Lot 31. According to this surveyors evidence it was a 10 feet wide road.

According to the Plaintiff, it was on or about 12-09-2000 that the Defendants had forcibly

widened this road. He had stated further that he restored a fence using about 20 concrete

posts on 25-08-2002. He had made a complaint to the Pindeniya Police Station on 25-08-2002

as the Defendants are alleged to have removed these concrete posts.

The Licensed Surveyor Sisira Panditharatne who had executed the commission obtained by

the Defendants was called to give evidence on behalf of the Defendants. This surveyor also

in his evidence had stated that the roadway relevant to this action is 8 feet wide from point A

to D and 12 feet wide from point D to B. He too had observed and given evidence to the effect

that this roadway had been in use for a long time. He also had taken a firm view according to

his observation that it was a road used in common.

1 Page 113 of the brief.

(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 7 of 8

According to the Plaintiffs surveyor who was called upon to superimpose Lot 3 on the eastern

boundary of the land, the roadway was definitely a roadway more than the width of a footpath.

In my view, there is no justification for the Provincial High Court to reject the position of the

Defendants that such a roadway was in existence merely because several witnesses called by

the Defendants had given slightly different measurements as to the widths of the roads as at

different years. Indeed, it is a fact that the width of this road was increased from time to time.

It is also in evidence that this has been declared as a public road owned and maintained by

the 4th Defendant, Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha. Despite calling for objections as per the

Gazette No 1188, the Plaintiff had not offered any resistance for such declaration of this road

as a Pradeshiya Sabha Road. Indeed, it is the evidence of all surveyors that they had observed

that this is a roadway which had minimum width of 8 feet at one point and is a roadway used

by people for a long time. The Plaintiff had not taken any action to challenge the declarations

published in the relevant Gazettes. In the absence of such a challenge or any objections, it is

also not justifiable and lawful for the Provincial High Court Judge to hold that these

declarations are not valid. I see no justification for such conclusion. Thus, it is a mere

statement not supported by any factual or legal position and cannot have a place in this case.

Having regard to the evidence adduced in this case, I am of the view that there is sufficient

evidence to prove that the impugned roadway was in existence for a long time. I have already

held that the reasons given by the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals

to reject the evidence of the Defendant are not acceptable. Therefore, there is no justification

for the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals to overrule the finding of the learned District

Judge that the impugned roadway has been a road which is 8 feet wide; the said roadway

has been used in that way for a long time; the said roadway is a roadway owned and

maintained by the Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Defendants have not disputed that the Plaintiff holds the title to the rest of the land

described in the Schedule to the Plaint. What they dispute is the apparent encroachment by

the Plaintiff moving his eastern boundary on to the disputed roadway which stands widened

from a foot path to a much wider road. The evidence adduced in this case at the trial, both

by the Plaintiff and the Defendants do not positively establish that the Plaintiff has been

successful in establishing the eastern boundary of this land. In view of the above, there is no

justification for the learned judge of the Provincial Hugh Court of Civil Appeals to overrule the

conclusion of the learned District Judge that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the other relief

prayed for, in the other prayers as the Plaintiff had failed to properly identify his land.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Provincial Hugh

Court of Civil Appeals has erred when it had set aside the judgment of the learned District

(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 8 of 8

Judge. Rather than answering the questions of law in respect of which this Court has granted

Leave to Appeal individually and directly, I find it appropriate to provide a composite answer

to all of them as follows:

There is no justification for the learned Provincial Hugh Court judge to overrule

the conclusion of the learned District Judge that the Plaintiff is not entitled to

the other relief prayed for, in the other prayers in the plaint as the Plaintiff had

failed to properly identify his land.

I proceed to set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals and restore

the judgment of the District Court. The Defendants are entitled to costs.
