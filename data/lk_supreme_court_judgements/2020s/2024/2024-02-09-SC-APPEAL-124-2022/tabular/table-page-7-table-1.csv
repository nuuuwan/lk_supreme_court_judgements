"(SC Appeal 124/22) - Page 7 of 8"
"According to the Plaintiffâ€™s surveyor who was called upon to superimpose Lot 3 on the eastern"
"boundary of the land, the roadway was definitely a roadway more than the width of a footpath."
"In my view, there is no justification for the Provincial High Court to reject the position of the"
"Defendants that such a roadway was in existence merely because several witnesses called by"
"the Defendants had given slightly different measurements as to the widths of the roads as at"
"different years. Indeed, it is a fact that the width of this road was increased from time to time."
"It is also in evidence that this has been declared as a public road owned and maintained by"
"the 4th Defendant, Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha. Despite calling for objections as per the"
"Gazette No 1188, the Plaintiff had not offered any resistance for such declaration of this road"
"as a Pradeshiya Sabha Road. Indeed, it is the evidence of all surveyors that they had observed"
"that this is a roadway which had minimum width of 8 feet at one point and is a roadway used"
"by people for a long time. The Plaintiff had not taken any action to challenge the declarations"
"published in the relevant Gazettes. In the absence of such a challenge or any objections, it is"
"also  not  justifiable  and  lawful  for  the  Provincial  High  Court  Judge  to  hold  that  these"
"declarations  are  not  valid.  I  see  no  justification  for  such  conclusion.  Thus,  it  is  a  mere"
"statement not supported by any factual or legal position and cannot have a place in this case."
"Having regard to the evidence adduced in this case, I am of the view that there is sufficient"
"evidence to prove that the impugned roadway was in existence for a long time. I have already"
"held that the reasons given by the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals"
"to reject the evidence of the Defendant are not acceptable. Therefore, there is no justification"
"for the Provincial High Court  of Civil Appeals  to overrule the finding of the learned District"
"Judge that the impugned roadway has been a road which is 8 feet wide; the said roadway"
"has  been  used  in  that  way  for  a  long  time;  the  said  roadway  is  a  roadway  owned  and"
"maintained by the Galigamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha."
"The  Defendants  have  not  disputed  that  the  Plaintiff  holds  the  title  to  the  rest  of  the  land"
"described in the Schedule to the Plaint. What they dispute is the apparent encroachment by"
"the Plaintiff moving his eastern boundary on to the disputed roadway which stands widened"
"from a foot path to a much wider road. The evidence adduced in this case at the trial, both"
"by  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendants  do  not  positively  establish  that  the  Plaintiff  has  been"
"successful in establishing the eastern boundary of this land. In view of the above, there is no"
"justification for the learned judge of the Provincial Hugh Court of Civil Appeals to overrule the"
"conclusion  of  the  learned  District  Judge  that  the  Plaintiff is  not  entitled  to  the  other  relief"
"prayed for, in the other prayers as the Plaintiff had failed to properly identify his land."
"For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Provincial Hugh"
"Court of Civil Appeals has erred when it had set aside the judgment of the learned District"
