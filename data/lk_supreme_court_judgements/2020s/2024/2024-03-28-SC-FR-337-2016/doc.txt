THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioner, S. Junaideen, who is an importer of general food items and tobacco leaves

for the manufacturing of beedi for the domestic market, invoked the fundamental rights

jurisdiction of this Court alleging violations of Articles 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the

Constitution by his arrest, detention and subsequent production before the Magistrate

by the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

2. Having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and submissions on behalf of the

Attorney-General, on 16th January 2017, this Court granted leave to proceed on the

alleged violations of Article 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) by the 2nd Respondent.

Factual Matrix

3. The 2nd Respondent (now retired) was a Superintendent in the Customs Revenue Task

Force (hereinafter ‘RTF’) who was responsible for the Customs Inquiry

(CRTF/1359/CCR/2679) conducted against the Petitioner, at the time material to this

case.

4. According to the Petitioner, he had, along with his wife, produced himself before the RTF

Office at Orugodawatta on 30th August 2016, having received summons purportedly

issued by the 2nd Respondent on behalf of the Director General of Customs. As the 2nd

Respondent was not in his office, he had undertaken to return on the following day as

advised by the RTF Office.

5. When he produced himself at the RTF Office on the following day, i.e. 31st August 2016,

the 2nd Respondent had forced him to admit that he was involved in the importation and

removal of an undeclared craft paper shipment without proper examination of the goods

for customs purposes. When Petitioner had refused to admit the same, the 2nd

Respondent had threatened that he would not be released unless such admission was

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 13

made. Thereafter, the Petitioner had sought permission from the 2nd Respondent to

return home owing to some medical conditions, providing proof thereof. Accordingly,

the 2nd Respondent had released the Petitioner after obtaining an undertaking to report

at his office once again on the following day.

6. The Petitioner states that, when the Petitioner visited on the following day, i.e. 01st

September 2016, the 2nd Respondent had once again started to demand that he admit

the allegations levelled against him. When the Petitioner refused, the 2nd Respondent

had informed him that he was under arrest and that he would be remanded after being

produced before the Magistrate.

7. The Petitioner further states that he fainted at the RTF Office due to the tremendous

pressure he felt and that he was subsequently taken to the Colombo General Hospital in

one of the Customs vehicles. The 2nd Respondent had accompanied him to the Hospital

and doctors had informed him that he needed to be admitted.

8. According to the Written Submissions of the Petitioner, on the following day, i.e. 02nd

September 2016, in furtherance of a “B Report”1 dated 31st August 2016, filed before the

Colombo Magistrates Court, the 2nd Respondent had tendered further reports to the

Magistrate pleading the Petitioner be remanded. As the power to grant bail to any

persons accused or suspected of an offence under the Customs Ordinance in respect of

goods exceeding the value of one million rupees is vested in the High Court, the

Petitioner was according remanded.2

1 Technically a report under Section 127 of the Customs Ordinance

2 Section 127C of the Customs Ordinance No. 17 of 1869 (as amended by § 6 of Act No. 24 of 1991) provides as follows: “No person suspected or accused of an offence under this Ordinance in respect of any goods the value of which exceeds one million rupees, shall be released on bail except by the High Court, in exceptional circumstances. The power conferred on the High Court by this section shall be exercised by the Judge of the High Court holden in the Zone within which the accused resides or the Judge of the High Court holden in the Zone within which the offence is alleged to have been committed.”

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 13

9. Although the Petitioner has set out various other details regarding what transpired

thereafter, as the same are not relevant to the questions brought before this Court

regarding his arrest, detention and subsequent production before the Magistrate, I see

no need to mull over them.

Alleged Violation of Article 13(1): Arrest and Detention

10. Article 13(1) of the Constitution provides that “[n]o person shall be arrested except

according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the

reason for his arrest.”

11. This Article covers not only arrest but also detention except in accordance with the

procedure established by law.3 The procedure established by law in the instant case is

set out in the Customs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1869 (as amended). Where the Ordinance is

silent, the procedure set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act shall apply.

12. According to Section 127 of the Customs Ordinance,

“Every offence under this Ordinance shall be deemed to be cognisable within the

meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and any person against whom a

reasonable suspicion exists that he has been guilty of any such offence may be

arrested in any place either upon land or water by any officer of Customs or other

person duly employed for the prevention of smuggling. Every person so arrested

shall with all convenient dispatch, be taken before the nearest Director-

General of Customs to be dealt with according to law.” 4

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 13

13. The 2nd Respondent, in his Affidavit dated 18th May 2017, has set out the particulars with

regard to the process of investigation in extensive detail, in an attempt to enlighten this

Court as to the reasonable suspicion he acted upon. It appears, prima facie, from the

contents therein, that the 2nd Respondent has prudently carried out a careful

investigation which pointed towards the Petitioner.

14. However, I see no need to needlessly consider these facts in detail, as the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner unequivocally conceded before this Court, when this matter was taken

up for argument, that reasonable suspicion existed against the Petitioner at the time of

his arrest.

15. However, the learned Counsel contended, interpreting Section 127, that there is an

additional requirement imposed by the Customs Ordinance to be met where an arrest or

detention is effected thereunder. Indeed, where a person is arrested under the

reasonable suspicion of committing an offence under the Ordinance, it requires that all

persons so arrested “with all convenient dispatch, be taken before the nearest Director-

General of Customs to be dealt with according to law”.

16. In general, I am inclined to agree with the learned Counsel that there can be a violation

of Article 13(1) where there is a failure to promptly produce a person arrested ‘before

the nearest Director-General of Customs’. The question, then, is whether the Petitioner

has been so produced before a ‘Director General of Customs’

17. The term Director General of Customs is defined in Section 1675 of the Customs

Ordinance. As provided therein,

5 Interpretation section of the Customs Ordinance

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 13

“"Director-General” shall mean the Director-General of Customs, Director, Assistant

Director of Customs, Superintendent of Customs, or other principal acting officer

of Customs of any port or place”6

18. It is clear, from the words I have emphasized in the above Section, that a Superintended

of Customs is included within the meaning of ‘Director General of Customs’, which was

the post held by the 2nd Respondent at the time material, for the purpose of Section 127.

19. However, it was the position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that even where

the officer effecting arrest is a ‘Director General of Customs’ as contemplated in Section

127 read with Section 167, it is necessary for such officer to take such arrestee before

another Director General of Customs to obtain an opinion as to whether the arrestee is

capable of interfering with the investigation, requiring such arrestee to be produced

before a Magistrate.

20. In support of this, he relied upon the following reasoning of Amerasinghe, J. in Farook

v. Raymond and Others,7

“…Imprisoning the Petitioner and confiscating his passport, and bringing the

petitioner before a Magistrate and requesting the magistrate to order the further

detention of the Petitioner in police custody, were things the 1st Respondent was

neither required nor authorized by law to do. And by not producing the Petitioner'

with all convenient despatch' before the nearest Director-General of Customs or

other Customs officer, he failed to act according to procedure established by law, viz.

section 127 of the Customs Ordinance. I find myself in agreement with Mr.

Goonesekere's submissions. I have no hesitation in declaring that the 1st Respondent

acted in contravention of the Petitioner's fundamental right guaranteed by Article 13

6 Emphasis is mine

7 (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 217 at 224-5

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 13

(1) of the Constitution of freedom from arrest except according to procedure

established by law.” 8

21. In Farook v. Raymond and Others, one of the respondent police officers had stopped

and caused the motor vehicle of the petitioner at a roadblock causing the same to be

searched having suspected the goods therein to be stolen or smuggled. Thereafter, the

said petitioner was taken to the police station, where was put in a cell and treated

roughly, in violation of the procedure established by law.

22. This case is easily distinguishable from the case at hand, for the instant matter involves

an arrest made by a customs officer, unlike the Farook case where a police officer had

made the arrest. Where a police officer effects an arrest under the Customs Ordinance,

as His Lordship has observed, such police officer must absolutely cause the arrestee to

be produced before the nearest Director General of Customs, as contemplated in the

Ordinance, ‘with all convenient despatch’.

23. Moreover, the instance case involves not an extemporaneous arrest as in the Farook

case, but an arrest made following a thorough investigation and in pursuance of advice

received thereon. In this regard, the Affidavit of the 2nd Respondent provides as follows:

“Thereafter I submitted a report stating the position of the investigation to the

Director RTF Mr. J.P. Chandraratne and on his instructions, Mr. Chandraratne and

myself met Mr. Chulananda Perera, the Director General in the afternoon on

01.09.2016 and informed the evidence available against petitioner for the smuggling

of the consignment in question. It was decided to arrest the petitioner considering

the gravity of the offence and the possibility of destroying evidence and to conduct

the investigation without any obstructions…

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 13

The Director General granted permission to arrest the second suspect, who is the

petitioner of this case, and instructed me to produce the suspect before the

Magistrate.” 9

24. As proof thereof, the 2nd Respondent has attached thereto the Report he submitted to

the Director of the RTF marked R2(e).10 Having perused the said Report, the Court

observes that the 2nd Respondent had, in fact, given a succinct, yet sufficient, summary

of the evidence against the Petitioner along with an explanation as to why it would be

prudent to produce the Petitioner before the Magistrate.

25. The contents of the 2nd Respondent’s Affidavit are corroborated by the Affidavit of

Jayasekera Pathirannehelage Chandraratne,11 Director of Customs, Revenue Task Force

Directorate, at the time material, as well as the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent.12

26. From the minute dated 01st September 2016 on the said Report marked R2(e), the above

averments are further corroborated. Instructions are written thereon, in no uncertain

terms to arrest and procedure the suspect, viz. the Petitioner, to the Magistrate.

Furthermore, from the minute dated 2nd September 2016 thereon, it appears that the 2nd

Respondent had kept the Director General of Customs informed of the progress of the

investigation.

27. In fact, the Director General of Customs, in his Affidavit, categorically states that “[t]he

2nd respondent submitted a written report stating reasons that there are possibilities of

obstruction of the investigation by the second suspect Mr. S. Junaideen (the petitioner)” and

that he “…authorized Mr. V.W. Nanayakkara, Superintendent of Customs to arrest the

suspect and to produce him to the Hon Magistrate in terms of section 127 A of Customs

Ordinance”.13 The said Affidavit further states that the Director General “…issued

instructions to the 2nd Respondent to arrest the Petitioner and to produce him to Court.” 14

28. The purpose of Section 127 of the Customs Ordinance, as it appears to me, is to maintain

some form of oversight over investigations, arrests and subsequent detentions so as to

increase accountability on the part of State officials. In this spirit, the phrase ‘the nearest

Director General of Customs’ therein means the most expeditiously approachable

Customs officer of the ranks contemplated in Section 167,

29. The 2nd Respondent in the instant case, has acted upon the advice of not only his

immediate supervisor but also the highest ranked officer in Sri Lanka Customs, the

Director-General himself. As such, I find the 2nd Respondent's impugned conduct to be

in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Customs Ordinance.

30. Accordingly, I find no violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution.

Alleged Violation of Article 13(2)

31. According to Article 13(2) of the Constitution, “[e]very Person held in custody, detained or

otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest

competent court according to procedure established by law and shall not be further held

in custody, detained or deprived or personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order

of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law.”

14 Ibid at para 7

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 13

32. As was held in Channa Peiris v. Attorney-General,15 by Amerasinghe J, while illegal

arrest makes subsequent detention ipso facto illegal, the fact that an arrest and

subsequent detention is illegal ‘does not carry with it the corollary that Article 13(2) is

violated.16 Articles 13(2), while intricately related to Article 13(1), have a separate and

independent existence. There can be a violation of Article 13(2) in the absence of a

violation of Article 13(2).

33. In Channa Peiris Amerasinghe J opined:

“The provisions of both Articles 13(1) and 13(2) may be violated in a given case…

However, the fact that Article 13(1) is violated does not necessarily mean that Article

13(2) is therefore violated. Nor does the violation of Article 13(2) necessarily mean

that Article 13(1) is violated. Arrest and detention, as a matter of definition, apart

from other relevant considerations, are "inextricably linked". However, Article 13(1)

and 13(2) have a related but separate existence. Article 13(1) is concerned with the

right of a person not to be arrested including the right to be kept arrested except

according to procedure established by law and the right to be informed of the reasons

for arrest, whereas Article 13(2) is concerned with the right of a person arrested to be

produced before a judge according to procedure established by law and the right not

to be further deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of

such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law…

The fact that Article 13(1) was not violated does not necessarily mean that Article

13(2) cannot be violated. For instance, a person may be arrested on grounds of

reasonable suspicion and given reasons for his arrest. However, if he is not produced

before a judge in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law - and that is the

15 [1994] 1 Sri LR 1

16 Ibid at 95

S.C. F.R. 337/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 13

matter dealt with by Article13(2) - there will be a violation of Article 13(2), although

Article 13(1) was not violated.”17

34. The Petitioner, according to his own admission, had fainted at the instance of his arrest

resulting in his hospitalisation. The 2nd Respondent had gone with the Petitioner to the

hospital in a Customs vehicle, and one of the Petitioner’s friends who accompanied them

had signed the admissions papers. According to the Report in terms of Section 127 of

the Customs Ordinance dated 02nd September 2016 submitted to the Colombo

Magistrate Court No. 6, the hospitalization had happened around 7.10 p.m., which the

Petitioner at no point disputed.

35. Furthermore, minute dated 02nd September 2016 on the aforementioned Report marked

R2(e)18 indicates as follows:

“… Following day on 02.09.2016, submitted a further report to the Hon. Magistrate

and the Magistrate visited the suspect who admitted in the ward 45 [sic] on the bed

34 and ordered to the Superintendent of Welikada Prison to provide prison security

to the suspect… [sic]”19

36. As such, it is clear that the 2nd Respondent had taken necessary steps to expeditiously

report facts to the Magistrate following the hospitalization. Thereafter, the Petitioner had

been in judicial custody.

37. Under these circumstances, I find no violation of Article 13(2) of the Constitution as well.

Alleged Violation of Article 12(1)

38. With regard to Article 12(1) of the Constitution, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

sought to argue that a violation of the Rule of Law has occurred ipso facto the violation

of fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 13(1) and 13(2) vis-à-vis the Petitioner.

39. As I have already decided that there had been no violation of Articles 13(1) and 13(2),

this submission has no legs to stand on and is accordingly rejected.

40. Considering the totality of the circumstances discussed hereinbefore, I find no violation

of Articles 13(1), 13(2) or 12(1).
