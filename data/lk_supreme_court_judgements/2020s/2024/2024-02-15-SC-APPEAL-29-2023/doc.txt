S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter the Applicant) filed an

application in the Labour Tribunal on 14th August 2015, alleging the Respondent-

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter the Respondent) to have unjustly terminated his

services. The Appellant sought inter alia reasonable compensation against the unjust

termination, gratuity for a service period of 15 years, cost and such other reliefs as the

Court deems fit and reasonable. The Respondent pleaded that no relief should be

granted to the Applicant as no termination of services had taken place and moved that

the application be dismissed.

The Labour Tribunal following an inquiry, by its order dated 28th September 2017

decided the case in favour of the Applicant and granted compensation equivalent to

the salary of 36 months. Being dissatisfied with the said order, the Respondent invoked

the appellate jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden in

Galle (hereinafter referred to as the High Court) under section 31DD of the Industrial

Disputes Act (as amended) and the High Court pronounced its judgment on 22nd July

2020. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment, inter alia, upheld the order of the

President of the Labour Tribunal on the basis that the findings of the Tribunal were

correct. Being dissatisfied with the said order the Respondent filed a leave to appeal

application and after the matter was supported, leave was granted on the following

questions of law:

(a) Did the President of the Labour Tribunal and the Provincial High Court

misdirected themselves in deciding that the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioners

had unjustly terminated the services of the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent?

(b) Did the Provincial High Court misdirected in deciding that the learned President

of the Labour Tribunal has correctly calculated the quantum of compensation?

Factual Matrix

The Applicant's position was that he was employed in a business named Hotel Francis'

managed by the Respondents since the year 2000, and in the year 2015, the said hotel

was closed down, whereupon the Applicant was deemed to have been terminated

from the employment. The position of the Respondents was that there was no

termination but due to the ill health of the 2nd Respondent who managed the hotel,

they were compelled to close down the business and all other employees except the

Applicant had accepted compensation, but the Applicant without accepting the

compensation has gone to the Labour Tribunal alleging unlawful termination of his

services.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal has based his entire finding on the basis

that the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of

1971 as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as TEWA) should apply in the

event a business was closed down, and the termination of the Applicant amounts to

an unlawful termination due to the Respondents failure to comply with the Act before

closing down the business.

"

[When closing a business with employees, a procedure has been

introduced by the prevailing law in Sri Lanka and that is to inform

the Commissioner of Labour and follow the relevant procedure

under Termination of Employment of Workmen Act]

"

( )

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 11

[The applicant's employment has ended due to the closure of the

establishment and the said closure is an action that has taken place

over a period of time and is not an abrupt uncontrolled event (as it

was a foreseeable act). I am of the view that it is unfair and unjust

to unilaterally close down the institution and terminate the service

of the applicant without acting under the Termination of

Employment of Workmen Act.]''

[Approximate translations added]

It is submitted by the Respondent that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal in

applying the TEWA, has failed to consider the limitation imposed by the provisions of

the Act itself. In that, Section 3(1)(a) of the Act becomes relevant insofar as the

applicability of the Act is concerned.

Section 3(1)(a) of the Act provides;

"The provisions of this Act, other than this section, shall not apply to

an employer by whom less than fifteen workmen on an average have

been employed during the period of six months preceding the month

in which the employer seeks to terminate the employment of a

workman."

It is to be noted that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal has failed to give

due consideration to the provision of the Act where it states that the TEWA applies

only to a business in which there were more than fifteen (15) employees on an average

during the period of preceding six (6) months. According to the evidence of the

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

Applicant himself, there have been less than fifteen (15) persons employed by the

business of the Respondents.

According to the evidence of the 2nd Respondent the said position has been confirmed.

[Q: At the time of closing the hotel, how many workers were there?]

: 5 6

[A: 5 or 6]

In this backdrop, the Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the learned President

of the Labour Tribunal has applied the TEWA without considering the applicable

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

provisions in the Act. The entire finding of the Labour Tribunal President is based on

this incorrect legal application and, hence, the finding of the President of the Labour

Tribunal regarding the unlawful termination cannot stand. Accordingly, I answer the

1st question of law in the affirmative.

In the second ground of appeal, it was contended the calculation of compensation to

be neither rational nor justifiable due to the following reasons:

i. At the time of giving evidence in the year 2016, the Applicant was 73 years old

and the closing down of the business took place in the year 2015 when he was

72 years old.

ii. The Applicant in his evidence has stated that he could have worked for a few

more years despite his old age.

iii. Soon after the closure of the business, he had found alternative employment

with a higher salary.

As I observed, in the judgment of the Provincial High Court, the learned High Court

Judge has also made the same erroneous findings regarding the applicability of the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971 as

well as the calculation of compensation. Furthermore, I am of the view that, even

though the judgment of Up Country Distributors (Private) Limited v. Subasinghe

(1992) 2 SLR 330 has been cited in the judgment of the Provincial High Court, the

factors that need to be considered in calculating compensation have been misapplied.

The parameters set out in the said case, namely:

a. the nature of the employer's business and his capacity to pay,

b. the employee's age, and

c. the nature of his employment,

have not been properly applied in justifying the calculation of compensation.

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

In Ceylon Transport Board v. A.H. Wijeratne (1975) 77 NLR 481 at 498,

Vythialingam J., after careful analysis of the law and the just and equitable concept,

held as follows:

The Labour Tribunal should normally be concerned to compensate the

employee for the damages he has suffered in the loss of his

employment and legitimate expectations for the future in that

employment, in the injury caused to his reputation in the prejudicing

of further employment opportunities. Punitive considerations should

not enter into its assessment except perhaps in those rare cases where

very serious acts of discrimination are clearly proved. Account should

be taken of such circumstances as the nature of the employer's

business and his capacity to pay, the employee's age. the nature of his

employment, length of service, seniority, present salary, future

prospects, opportunities for obtaining similar alternative employment,

his past conduct, the circumstances and the manner of the dismissal

including the nature of the charge levelled against the workman, the

extent to which the employee's actions were blameworthy and the

effect of the dismissal on future pension rights and any other relevant

considerations. Account should also be taken of any sums paid or

actually earned or which should also have been earned since the

dismissal took place.

The calculation of compensation is subjective and it depends on several factors such

as the type and nature of employment, period served, past conduct of the employee,

contribution to the employer/establishment, future prospects, type of offence

committed or the reason for termination. Moreover, when computing the

compensation, the Tribunal should be mindful of the age of the Applicant, the service

he had rendered as well as his capacity for future employment.

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

As discussed in this case, when the age of the employee is considered, he is far beyond

the age of retirement of a public or private sector employee. Where the nature of the

business and ability to pay compensation is considered, it was established that the

business has been closed down and the 2nd Respondent is terminally ill even at the

time of giving evidence which itself was the reason to close down the business. Where

the present employment of the Applicant was considered, he is already employed

elsewhere for a higher salary which makes him further disqualified for compensation

since he has not sustained a financial loss by not being employed by the Respondents.

When all the totality of the above facts are taken into account, it shows that the learned

High Court Judge has dismissed the appeal without taking into consideration the

proper legal and factual merits of the case. Hence, I answer the 2nd question of law,

too, affirmatively.

Furthermore, as I have previously noted, the question of law concerning the

applicability of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 45 of 1971 (as amended) to the business of the Respondents has not been duly

analysed by the learned High Court Judge. The Respondents-Appellants-Appellants,

having had 6 or 7 employees during the time of closure and several months before

that, cannot be placed within the ambit of the Act. The said error or failure in analysis

by the learned High Court Judge is an error which goes to the root of the case.

Accordingly, the said decision cannot stand.

Decision

In the said circumstances, for the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the findings

of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High Court Judge of

the Provincial High Court of Galle with regard to the applicability of the Termination

of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971 (as amended) is

erroneous. Further, I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court

has misdirected himself in deciding that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

has correctly calculated the quantum of compensation.

SC APPEAL No. 29/2023 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

As such, both questions of law are answered in the affirmative.

However, in altering the aforementioned errors committed by the learned President of

the Labour Tribunal and learned High Court Judge, this Court must, too, give an order

that is fair, just and reasonable in the eyes of a reasonable man. It would not be

desirable nor would it be fair, just and reasonable for employers to simply terminate

the services of an employee without prior notice where such termination is plainly

foreseeable as was in the instant case.

I accordingly alter the order made with regard to the compensation directing the

Respondents-Appellants-Appellants to pay the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent, ex

gratia, a sum equivalent to the salary of one month at the time of termination.

Appeal Allowed.
