"It is clear from the perusal of Section 434 of the Penal Code that the said section has imposed"
"a maximum sentence of one year Rigorous Imprisonment to a person who is convicted for"
"committing that offence."
"T
herefore, the learned Magistrate could not have lawfully imposed a sentence of two years"
"Rigorous  Imprisonment  for  the  Accused-Appellant-Appellant  who  has  been  convicted  for"
"committing an offence punishable under Section 434 of the Penal Code."
"L
earned State Counsel concedes this position and submitted that the learned Magistrate has"
"made an error."
"W
e therefore set aside the sentence of two years imposed on the Accused-Appellant-Appellant"
"by the learned Magistrate on 30-05-2019 in respect of the first count in the Charge Sheet."
"W
e proceed to substitute a sentence of one year in place of that sentence."
"T
he order made by the learned Magistrate on 30-05-2019 and the Judgment of the Provincial"
"High Court dated 15-12-2020 must stand altered to that extent."
