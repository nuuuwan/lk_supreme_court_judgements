Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant-Appellant and

also the submissions of the learned State Counsel and concluded the argument of this case.

The Accused-Appellant-Appellant along with two other persons stood charged in the

Magistrates Court of Panadura under three counts. The Accused-Appellant-Appellant was the

1st Accused in the case. These three counts are as follows:

(1) Committing the offence of House-trespass on the property of Malalage Leelawathi

Pieris, an offence punishable under Section 434 of the Penal Code.

(2) Causing hurt to said Malalage Leelawathi Pieris, an offence punishable under Section

314 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

(3) Committing robbery of cash amounting to Rs. 200,000.00 from the possession of said

Malalage Leelawathi Pieris, an offence punishable under Section 382 read with Section

32 of the Penal Code.

After the trial, the learned Magistrate by his judgment dated 12-11-2018 has convicted the

Accused-Appellant-Appellant for all three counts and acquitted and discharged the 2nd & 3rd

Accused from all the counts.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Accused-Appellant-Appellant has appealed to the

Provincial High Court.

The Provincial High Court after the argument of the said appeal, by its Judgment dated 15-

12-2020, has decided to affirm the said conviction and the sentence imposed on the Accused-

Appellant-Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment dated 15-12-2020 pronounced by the Provincial High

Court, the Accused-Appellant-Appellant has filed the instant Appeal.

When the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant to the instant Appeal was supported, this Court,

by its order dated 09-02-2023, has granted Special Leave to Appeal in respect of the following

question.

Is the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate on count 1 of the Charge

sheet excessive?

It is clear from the perusal of Section 434 of the Penal Code that the said section has imposed

a maximum sentence of one year Rigorous Imprisonment to a person who is convicted for

committing that offence.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate could not have lawfully imposed a sentence of two years

Rigorous Imprisonment for the Accused-Appellant-Appellant who has been convicted for

committing an offence punishable under Section 434 of the Penal Code.

Learned State Counsel concedes this position and submitted that the learned Magistrate has

made an error.

We therefore set aside the sentence of two years imposed on the Accused-Appellant-Appellant

by the learned Magistrate on 30-05-2019 in respect of the first count in the Charge Sheet.

We proceed to substitute a sentence of one year in place of that sentence.

The order made by the learned Magistrate on 30-05-2019 and the Judgment of the Provincial

High Court dated 15-12-2020 must stand altered to that extent.

The learned Magistrate of Panadura is directed to take necessary steps to enforce the altered

sentence.
