"10              SC/CHC/APPEAL/81/2014"
"decree appealed against present to the original court a petition of appeal”."
"It  may  be  noted  that  the  word  used  in  this  section  is  “from”,  not  “of”."
"Hence it was held in the Divisional Bench decision of the Court of Appeal"
"in Jinadasa v. Hemamali [2006] 2 Sri LR 300 that the date of pronouncing"
"the judgment should be excluded from the computation of the time within"
"which the petition of appeal should be presented."
"Section 8(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance states “Where a limited time"
"from any date or from the happening of any event is appointed or allowed"
"by any written law for the doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding"
"in a court or office, and the last day of the limited time is a day on which"
"the court or office is closed, then the act or proceeding shall be considered"
"as done or taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day thereafter"
"on which the court or office is open.”"
"Fourteen days is “a limited time” given to a party to make the application."
"It is in that context I stated that if the fourteenth day coincides with a"
"day when the office of the Court is closed, submitting the application on"
"the next day when the office is open would be sufficient compliance with"
"the time limit stipulated in section 86(2). This is in consonance with the"
"finding in Jinadasa v. Hemamali (supra) where the calculation of time was"
"done in relation to section 755(3)."
"Can  the  application  be  made  before  the  service  of  the  ex  parte"
"decree?"
"Does the term “within fourteen days of the service of the decree” in section"
"86(2) mean that the defaulting defendant must make the application after"
"service of the decree? In other words, can the Court state that there is no"
"proper application filed in terms of section 86(2) when the application has"
"been filed between fixing the case for ex parte trial and before service of"
"the ex parte decree? The answer is in the negative."
