"Allowing  the  appeal  and  setting  aside  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of"
"Appeal, Justice Sripavan (as he then was) observed:"
"From the contents of the affidavit,  I do not think that Counsel had"
"the intention to offend the dignity of the court or to abuse the process"
"of court.  It is not always possible to lay down any rigid, inflexible or"
"invariable rule which would govern all cases of default by counsel."
"Each case has to be considered on its own merits.  If, however, the"
"default  was  in  fact  accidental  and  committed  without  any  evil  or"
"ulterior motive, latitude has to be given to counsel to plead his case."
"The legal profession is a noble one and the mark of nobility includes"
"the  straightforward  habit  of  owning  mistakes  or  errors  and"
"apologizing to the opposite party and/or to court once such mistakes"
"or errors are realized.  When counsel tenders an unreserved apology"
"and explained to the satisfaction of court, the circumstances under"
"which the mistakes or errors were committed, it may be appropriate"
"for the court to accept it.  Once the counsel regrets his act, it is the"
"duty  of  court  to  make  him  feel  that  he  is  an  essential  link  in  the"
"administration  of  justice  and  that  his  apology  is  accepted  with  a"
"view  that  he  will henceforth uphold  the  highest  tradition  with due"
"diligence and thereby uphold the prestige of court."
"No counsel in my view should be punished for bona fide mistakes."
"The learned counsel frankly admitted his default on 02.02.2009 for"
"reasons adduced in his affidavit.  It appears to me that it was really"
"a  slip  on  his  part  not  to  have  taken  the  date  of  hearing  correctly."
