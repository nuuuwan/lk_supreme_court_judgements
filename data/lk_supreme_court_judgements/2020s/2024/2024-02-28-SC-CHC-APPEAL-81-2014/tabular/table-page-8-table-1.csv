"8              SC/CHC/APPEAL/81/2014"
"Section  754(4),  which  deals  with  when  a  notice  of  appeal  shall  be"
"tendered against a  judgment,  states that it shall be tendered “within  a"
"period of fourteen days from the date when the decree or order appealed"
"against was pronounced, exclusive of the day of that date itself and of the"
"day when the petition is presented and of Sundays and public holidays”."
"Section 757(1) which deals with when an application for leave to appeal"
"shall be made against an order is couched in identical terms."
"In  contrast,  section  86(2)  which  enacts  that  the  application  shall  be"
"presented  “within  fourteen  days  of  the  service  of  the  decree”  does  not"
"specify which days are excluded. Comparing the wording of section 86(2)"
"with  the  wording  of  sections  754(4)  and  757(1),  the  intention  of  the"
"legislature  is  clear.  In  calculating 
fourteen  days  for  the  purpose  of"
"purging default in terms of section 86(2), the date when the decree was"
"served,  the  date  when  the  application  to  purge  default  is  presented  to"
"Court, Sundays and public holidays are not excluded. The word “within”"
"in  section  86(2)  means  the  application  shall  be  presented  to  the  Court"
"within the specified fourteen-day window and not beyond that period. In"
"the  case  of  Flexport 
(Pvt)  Ltd  v.  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Ltd"
"(SC/APPEAL/3/2012,  SC  Minutes  of  15.12.2014)  the  Supreme  Court"
"reached the same conclusion."
"The  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (6th  Edition,  pages  1602-1603)  defines  the"
"word “within” as “when used relative to time, has been defined variously"
"as meaning anytime before; at or before; at the end of; before the expiration"
"of; not beyond; not exceeding; not later than”."
"Nevertheless, if the fourteenth day falls on a day on which the office of"
"the Court is closed, filing the application on the next day on which the"
"office of the Court is open would be in compliance with section 86(2)."
