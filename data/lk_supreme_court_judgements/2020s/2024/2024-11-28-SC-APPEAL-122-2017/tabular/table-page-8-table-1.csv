"possession, even for the building of the Wall- vide pages 88,90 and 101. To exercise possession,"
"one need not be present in the land. For example, an owner or a lessee who has the right to possess"
"a  land  in  Kurunegala  may  reside  far  away  in  Galle  and  sends  a  person  to  pluck  coconuts  to"
"Kurunegala  land  and  he  need  not  be  personally  present  during  the  harvesting  of  coconuts.  By"
"sending that person, the owner or the lessee does not intend to give any license to possess the land"
"to that person. That person only has a contractual relation to do the task entrusted to him and has"
