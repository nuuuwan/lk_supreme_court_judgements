"words,  the  position  of  the  Defendant  is  that  the  Plaintiff  is  estopped  from  denying  that  Rosa"
"Schneider is the lessee of the land in dispute and she is entitled to the possession of the same. The"
"defense of the Defendant is not that the cause of action is res judicata, but he came to the land on"
"the instruction and permission of the said Rosa Schneider who has the right to possession as the"
"lessee. In fact, the Plaintiff, contrary to the averments in her plaint that the said lease is not valid,"
"has admitted in evidence as mentioned above, that there is a valid lease agreement between the"
"Plaintiff and Rosa Schneider and the said Rosa Schneider is entitled to possess till the end of lease"
"period which is 99 years. The learned District Judge considered the filing of action No. 4600/L"
"and its outcome as evidence but the dismissal was based on the fact that the Defendant was not a"
"trespasser but a person who came to the land as an agent or one who was permitted by the said"
"lessee to do a task as instructed by the said lessee. This misapprehension that the learned District"
"Judge dismissed the plaint  on the ground of  res judicata appears to  be the main reason for the"
"setting aside of the District Court Judgment. Even it is assumed that the learned District Judge"
"considered it wrongly as res judicata between the parties to the instant action, it is not the only"
"reason to refuse eviction of the Defendant. The Judgment clearly indicates that the learned District"
"Judge correctly decided that the Defendant did not act as an unlawful entrant or a trespasser."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judges  in  their  judgment  has  stated  that,  as  mentioned  above,  the"
"Defendant cannot dispute the ownership of the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s title is well established"
"with the title deeds tendered in evidence. In fact, the Defendant has not challenged the title of the"
"Plaintiff. The Defendant’s stance is that the Plaintiff being the owner leased out the property to"
"Rosa  Schneider  and  he  came  to  the  land  on  the  instruction  of  said  lessee  who  has  the  right  to"
"possess.  Even  the  learned  District  Judge  in  his  judgment  has  accepted  the  Plaintiff’s  title  but"
"correctly refused to grant relief including the declaration of title as no cause of action has been"
"proved against the Defendant as he was not a trespasser. Without proving a cause of action, one"
"cannot claim for the reliefs prayed for. Thus, the learned High Court Judges erred in stating that"
"the Plaintiff is entitled to get her rights declared. The learned High Court Judges have also stated"
"that the Defendant has no right to be in possession of the subject matter. In fact, the issues framed"
"by the Defendant do not indicate that the Defendant has claimed any right to possess for his own"
"benefit. On the other hand, other than dismissing  the plaint, the learned  District  Judge had not"
"granted any other relief prayed by the Defendant."
