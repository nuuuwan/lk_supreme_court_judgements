"","•  Whatever the deficiencies in the documents that had given authority to act as an agent or"
"","licensee (නියයෝජිතයකු/ අවසරලාභියකු) of said Rosa Schneider,  Rosa Schneider had given"
"","evidence and clearly indicated that she gave permission and consent to the Defendant to do"
"","certain acts relating to the disputed land and, thus the Defendant prepared to put up a wall"
"","as an agent or licensee (නියයෝජිතයකු/ අවසරලාභියකු) of the said Rosa Schneider."
"•","Even though, the Condition No. 5 in the lease agreement, P6 states that lessor shall look"
"","after the said premises as caretaker when the lessee is out of the island, it does not prevent"
"","the lessee from possessing the said property through an agent, when the lessee is out of the"
"","island."
"•","The Lease agreement P6 does not contain any condition that the lessor should possess the"
"","premises when the lessee is not in the island."
"•","Even though, the 2nd condition in the lease agreement is to build a two storied building in"
"","the land, there is no time limit as to the completion of the said building. However, putting"
"","up a wall for the protection of the property is not an unreasonable act."
"•","In terms of the Lease Agreement P6, Judgment, decree, Fiscal Report of the delivery of"
"","possession and the Order dated 06.03.2002 in Case No. 4600/L, said Rosa Schneider is the"
"","lawful possessor of the land in dispute and as such, the Plaintiff is not entitled to reclaim"
"","the property."
"•","Since the lease agreement  P6 was in  operation, said  Rosa Schneider being the lessee  is"
"","entitled to possess the said property personally or through an agent."
"•","Therefore,  the  Defendant  had  not  entered  the  said  property  unlawfully,  forcibly  or  as  a"
"","trespasser, and entered thereon while acting as an agent of the said Rosa Schneider and also"
"","on her leave and license. Hence, the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim for ejectment of the"
"","Defendant."
