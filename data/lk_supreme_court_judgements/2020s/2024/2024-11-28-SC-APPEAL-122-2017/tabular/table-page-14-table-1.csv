"SC/APPEAL/122/17"
"The learned High Court judges have expressed the view that as per the lease agreement, when the"
"lessee is abroad, the lessor should look after the premises as a caretaker -vide clause 5 of the lease"
"agreement. Therefore, the Defendant cannot be in possession on behalf of the lessee.  As mentioned"
"above, there is no provision in the lease agreement which says that when the lessee is abroad, she"
"loses her right to possess. In fact, clause 6 states that “As care taker the lessor shall not be entitled"
"to sub-let the demised premises without the written consent of the lessee”. This indicates that the"
"intention was to keep the right to possess with the Defendant even when she is abroad. As explained"
"above, one need not be present at the property to exercise his right to possess.  During the trial at"
"the original  Court, the lessee, Rosa Schneider  has  given  evidence to  say that  she permitted the"
"Defendant to look after the said land as she relied on him and has lost the confidence and the faith"
"kept on the Plaintiff (Vide pages162  and 163 of the Brief). In fact, she had to file an action to"
"obtain the possession of the land. Thus, it was reasonable to get the Defendant to do the needful in"
"exercising her right to possess."
"Even though the learned High Court Judges held that, since the Defendant failed to establish any"
"legal  right  to  be  in  possession,  he  is  liable  to  be  ejected,  through  the  case  presented  by  the"
"Defendant  in  defense, the Defendant  has not  attempted to  establish a right  of his  own to  be in"
"possession of the property. Basically, the issues framed by him raised a defense that he was acting"
"on behalf of Rosa Schneider who has the right to possess and therefore he is not a trespasser. The"
"aforesaid Rosa Schneider has given evidence to that effect."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judges  had  stated  that  without  making  Rosa  Schneider  a  party,  the"
"Defendant could not have sought a declaration that said Rosa Schneider is a lawful lessee of the"
"premises. It must be noted that other than dismissing the plaint, the learned District Judge had not"
"given any other relief as prayed for in the answer. However, the District Court has come to the"
"conclusion that Rosa Schneider is the lawful lessee on evidence led at the trial. Even the Plaintiff"
"has  admitted  that  fact  which  was  supported  by  the  decision  in  the  case  No.4600/L,  Lease"
"Agreement marked P6 and the evidence of Rosa Schneider as well."
"The facts discussed above indicate that the learned High Court Judges failed to consider whether"
"the Plaintiff proved his cause of action, especially whether the Defendant was a trespasser or an"
"unlawful entrant who acted unlawfully, when facts revealed that he merely acted on the authority"
"given by the lessee who had the right to possess. Instead of finding whether the Plaintiff had proved"
