Argued on : 01.07.2024

Decided on : 29.11.2024

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J

1. The Petitioners, comprising both former and current members of the

Regular Service of the Police Department of Sri Lanka, were recruited as

Sub Inspectors (SIs) in the years 1990 and 1992. As at the time of filing

Page 12 of 32

their Petition, the Petitioners collectively possessed over two decades of

distinguished service, characterized by unblemished conduct and

dedication to duty.

2. Notwithstanding their extensive tenure, the Petitioners allege that their

career progression has been unjustly constrained, having received only two

promotions during their service periods: the first, to the rank of Inspector

of Police (IP), effective from January 1, 2006, and the second, for certain

Petitioners, to the rank of Chief Inspector (CI) on subsequent occasions.

3. The pith and substance of the Petitioners' complaint arises from the alleged

delay and misapplication of the promotional framework governing their

advancement. In particular, the Petitioners contend that their promotions

to the rank of IP ought to have been backdated to January 1, 2003, in

accordance with Circular No. 1737/2003, which introduced a Special

Scheme of Promotion. The Petitioners further argue that this purported

delay has adversely impacted their eligibility for subsequent promotions,

including to the rank of CI, thereby causing significant prejudice to their

career trajectories. They now seek equitable relief from this Court to rectify

these grievances.

Factual matrix:

4. In July 2002, a qualifying examination for promotion to the rank of IP was

conducted. While approximately 315 candidates successfully passed the

examination, the Petitioners did not succeed the examination.

Subsequently, Circular No. 1737/2003, issued on September 26, 2003,

introduced a Special Scheme of Promotion to address cadre vacancies,

which included 629 vacancies in the rank of IP.

Page 13 of 32

5. A further RTM to the Circular, bearing No. RTM 208 dated October 6, 2003

stipulated eligibility based on a minimum of five years of service as a SI.

As at that date, these Petitioners, who had already served as SIs for over a

decade, met the requisite eligibility criteria but as is borne out, only those

SIs with 12 years of service were promoted under Circular bearing No.

1737/2003.

6. At the time of issuance of Circular No. 1737/2003, 172 SIs who had already

completed over 12 years of service in the rank of SI were selected for

promotion to the rank of IP pursuant to the qualifying examination held in

2002 and began undergoing training in preparation for their appointment.

7. However, these promotions contemplated under Circular No. 1737/2003

were delayed due to the pendency of legal proceedings in CA Writ No.

1560/03, resulting in a stay order that halted the promotion process. Upon

the conclusion of the writ application in March 2005, 299 SIs were promoted

to the rank of IP, retrospectively, with effect from January 1, 2003.

8. Thus, it could be seen while 172 SIs were promoted as IPs based on

seniority and merit, 299 SIs were promoted as IPs on merit. The

appointment of these two categories of officers were made effect from

January 1, 2003. It has to be noted the Petitioners who has neither passed

the exam nor had 12 years of service were however, below these categories

of SIs who became IPs with effect from 2003.

9. While the position of these Petitioners stood as above another development

took place as regards Police officers in the Reserve Service of the Police

Department. The Cabinet took a decision on February 1, 2006, to absorb

the reserve police officers into the regular service of the Police Force. This

Cabinet decision also provided that these reserve force officers thus

Page 14 of 32

absorbed were to be placed immediately below the regular cadre officers of

the same rank on the seniority list. Despite this placement, the reservists

gained an advantage over the Petitioners in being considered for CI

promotions, owing inter alia to the Petitioners' promotions not being

backdated to January 1, 2003.

10. This Cabinet decision entailed the consequence of the reservists gaining an

advantage over the Petitioners in being considered for CI promotions at a

subsequent stage. It would however appear that there were 158 vacancies

yet remaining in the cadre of IPs. It could be gleaned from the pleadings

and the arguments that these Petitioners before this Court entertained the

legitimate expectation of filling these vacancies.

11. When this Cabinet decision took place to convert the reservists into

regulars, the Petitioners remained as SIs with no ante-dating of their

promotions as IPs with effect from January 1, 2003. In other words, the

principal complaint of these Petitioners is that had they been promoted as

IPs in 2006 with their promotions to be effective from January 1, 2003, they

would not have suffered this detriment of remaining as SIs.

12. Subsequently, a further Circular (RTM 129) was indeed issued in February

2006, granting these Petitioners promotions to the rank of IPs, but only

with effect from January 1, 2006. They contend that this created a

significant three-year delay in their promotions, marking a glaring

discrepancy in their career progression compared to their peers.

13. Whilst this application was pending before this Court, the Inspector

General of Police (IGP) at the time issued RTM 855 dated September 27,

2018, ordering the promotion of 14 IPs to the rank of CI with effect from

October 2, 2017. Notably, these 14 officers, who were promoted in terms of

Page 15 of 32

RTM 855, were those that had been absorbed into the regular service from

the reserve service under the 2006 Cabinet Decision and had been placed

below the Petitioners in the order of seniority in the rank of SIs.

14. It could be seen that the delayed promotions set in motion a cascade of

negative effects for the Petitioners. By the time they were promoted to the

rank of IPs, the eligibility window for promotions to the rank of CIs under

RTM 141 of 2006 had already closed, thereby rendering them ineligible for

further advancement during the subsequent promotional cycles. This

compounded the inequity, leaving the Petitioners at a distinct

disadvantage, both professionally and financially.

Petitioners Case:

15. The Petitioners assert that the delay in their promotions to the rank of IPs

and the subsequent misalignment in their career trajectory could be said to

have stemmed from the protracted legal proceedings in CA Writ No.

1560/03circumstances beyond their control. They argue that their

promotions should have been backdated to January 1, 2003, in line with

the provisions of Circular No. 1737/2003, which would have ensured their

rightful seniority.

16. The Petitioners contend that had their promotions been timeously and

correctly backdated, they would have gained seniority comparable to their

contemporaries, and, as a result, would have been eligible for promotions

to the rank of CIs during the subsequent cycles. The cascading effect of the

Respondents failure to rectify this situation not only derailed their career

advancement but caused substantial financial and professional prejudice.

Page 16 of 32

17. In an effort to resolve this issue, the Petitioners lodged multiple appeals

and representations with the IGP and the National Police Commission.

The Committee appointed by the IGP and its report

18. In response, the IGP appointed a committee comprising senior officers to

investigate the matter. In 2010, the committee issued a report confirming

the Petitioners eligibility for retrospective promotions to January 1, 2003,

and attributed the delay solely to the pendency of the writ proceedings.

Despite the committees recommendations, the Petitioners aver that the

Respondents failed to take corrective action, leaving them in a position of

inequity.

19. The Petitioners further contend that this failure on the part of the

Respondents created an untenable situation wherein officers absorbed from

the reserve police service and those promoted retroactively gained undue

seniority over them. This anomaly has had a lasting impact on their

professional standing within the Police Department and has inflicted

considerable prejudice upon them.

20. The Petitioners lodged complaints with the Human Rights Commission of

Sri Lanka (HRC) under case numbers HRC 4213/06 and HRC 5324/07.

While the HRC acknowledged the delay in promotions, it has yet to issue a

final determination, leaving the Petitioners without any effective recourse.

21. Thus, the Petitioners invoke the jurisdiction of this Court seeking as

substantive relief inter alia:

1. to declare that the Petitioners are eligible to apply to be selected for

the post of Chief Inspector of Police and

Page 17 of 32

2. to direct the [1st to 13th] Respondents and/or any one or more of them

to backdate the promotions of the Petitioners to the rank of IP with effect

from 01.01.2003.

Respondents Case:

22. The Respondents have provided detailed justifications addressing two

central issues raised by the Petitioners, which are as follows:

1. Eligibility of Officers Absorbed from the Reserve Force

23. Firstly, the Respondents address the Petitioners contention that the

officers who were absorbed from the Reserve Police Force into the regular

force in 2006 and promoted to the rank of IPs did not have eight years of

service in the regular force as of October 1, 2013. Despite this, these officers

were promoted to the rank of CIs, taking into account their service in the

reserve police force. In the view of the Petitioners this was improper, as

they argue that the promotion of officers from the reserve force should not

have superseded their own eligibility for promotion, given their longer

service in the regular force.

24. However, the Respondents assert that the integration of these officers was

based on specific administrative and operational needs, and thus, their

promotion to CI was not unjustified.

25. The Respondents argue that this was done in accordance with the

applicable rules and policies governing promotions, specifically to address

vacancies and operational needs within the Police Department. In this

context, the Respondents maintain that the promotion of these officers,

although they did not meet the standard requirement of service in the

regular force, was valid as their prior service in the Reserve force was

Page 18 of 32

recognized and factored into their overall service record. Therefore, the

Respondents assert that this promotion was not irregular but a necessary

administrative step to ensure effective policing.

2. Backdating of the Petitioners Promotion to January 1, 2003

26. Secondly, the Petitioners assert that their promotion to the rank of IPs

should be backdated to January 1, 2003, which is the date on which other

officers who sat for the promotion examination in 2002 were promoted. The

Petitioners further argue that this backdating would then make them

eligible to apply for promotion to the rank of CIs in 2013.

27. The Respondents, in response, contend that the delay in granting the

Petitioners promotions was due to circumstances beyond the control of the

Respondents, primarily legal proceedings which had resulted in a stay on

the promotions. The Respondents maintain that once the legal and

administrative hurdles were cleared, promotions were granted in

accordance with the existing circular, but the effective date of January 1,

2006, was deemed appropriate based on the available vacancies and the

legal framework in place at the time.

28. The Respondents argue that the Petitioners primary intention in seeking

to backdate their promotion to 2003 is to claim retrospective adjustments

to all subsequent promotions, potentially leading to their early promotion

to the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). Such

retrospective adjustments would create administrative confusion within

the police force.

29. Furthermore, the Respondents point out that the Petitioners accepted their

2006 promotions without protest and did not challenge their promotion

dates until several years later, only raising their grievances after failing to

Page 19 of 32

qualify for promotions in 2013. If the Petitioners genuinely believed they

were entitled to backdated promotions, they should have raised their

objections at the time of their promotion in 2006 or, at the very least, when

the recommendations to fill the 158 vacancies were made.

30. The Respondents conclude that the Petitioners allegations are baseless,

untimely, and lack merit. They submit that the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners have not been violated and move the Court to dismiss the

application with costs.

31. At the outset, it becomes imperative to address the Respondents objection

to the maintainability of this application, asserting that it is belated. They

contend that the Petitioners accepted their promotions in 2006 without

protest and failed to challenge the effective dates of such promotions until

several years later, only raising grievances following their inability to

qualify for promotions in 2013. According to the Respondents, if the

Petitioners genuinely believed they were entitled to backdated promotions,

they ought to have raised objections in 2006 or, at the time

recommendations were made to fill the 158 vacancies for CI promotions.

32. This Court, however, does not find merit in the Respondents argument of

delay. Fundamental rights violations, by their very nature, constitute

ongoing infractions, particularly where their adverse effects persist in

perpetuum. It is evident that the Petitioners did not acquiesce in the

validity of their 2006 promotions, as is apparent from their lodging a

complaint with the HRC under Reference No. HRC 4213/06, dated July 27,

2006, promptly seeking redress for their grievances.

33. Moreover, subsequent developments have highlighted the ongoing nature

of the alleged violation. These include the Petitioners' continued

Page 20 of 32

ineligibility under RTM 141, dated September 4, 2013, for promotion to the

rank of CIs; the advantage gained by those absorbed into the Regular

Service under the Cabinet Decision dated February 1, 2006, which allowed

them to be considered for CI promotions ahead of the Petitioners; and the

issuance of RTM 855 on September 27, 2018 by the IGP, which ordered the

promotion of 14 IPs to the rank of CIs, despite their prior placement below

the Petitioners in the seniority list. These actions, combined with the

Respondents' continued insistence on the 2006 promotions for the

Petitioners as valid, have perpetuated a situation in which the Petitioners'

constitutional rights remain infringed de die in diem.

34. The doctrine of continuing violation is particularly apposite in the present

matter, as the alleged infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights

is not confined to a singular, isolated act in 2006 but rather constitutes a

cascading series of acts and omissions that have had enduring

repercussions on the Petitioners careers and professional standing. A

continuing violation takes place when specific acts or omissions are so

interconnected as to constitute a cascading series of acts or omissions which

result in a domino effect such as loss of seniority and supersession by those

placed below the Petitioners. Thus, the Petitioners retain the right to

challenge the validity or tenability of the 2006 promotion and its

consequent implications, even at this juncture, as it represents both direct

and collateral attack on a continuing violation of their fundamental rights.

35. This Court has already observed that, after the promotion of 471 SIs, 158

vacancies remained in the rank of IPs. Notably, the 471 SIs promoted to

IPs with effect from 01.01.2003 comprised two categories: 172 SIs who had

been promoted on seniority and merit because of a previous examination

(seniority and merit) and 299 SIs who passed a subsequently held

qualifying examination. It must also be pointed out that the Petitioners

Page 21 of 32

were SIs, immediately below the 299 SIs, thus appointed as IPs with effect

from 01.01.2003.

36. It is a well-known fact among the parties that the promotions of 172 SIs

who had passed the subsequently held qualifying examination to the rank

of IPs, could not be effected due to a pending application before the Court

of Appeal in Case No. CA Writ/1560/03. The Court of Appeal had issued

an interim order restraining promotions to the rank of IPs until the final

hearing and determination of the said application.

37. Only after the termination of the said writ application in March 2005 were

the 299 SIs promoted to the rank of IPs, with effect from 01.01.2003.

38. By March 2005 both the categories of SIs had been promoted as IPs with

effect from 01.01.2003. Contrary to the arguments presented by the

Respondents, the Petitioners did not remain inactive. The material before

this Court demonstrates that they addressed a letter dated 05.05.2005 to

the then Secretary of the National Police Commission, requesting that their

long service be recognized and that they be promoted without delay.

However, it appears that no response was received to this letter even at the

time of filing this application before this Court.

39. Additionally, other surrounding circumstances clearly indicate that the

Petitioners had been actively agitating for their promotion to the rank of

IPs, insisting that the promotion be made effective from 01.01.2003.

40. As facts which would be recited presently demonstrate, the Petitioners

acted promptly, and the alleged violation stemming from an inaction they

claim, appears to have persisted continuously.

Page 22 of 32

Circular No. 1737/2003 dated 26.09.2003

41. With these findings in place, the Court now turns to an analysis of the

relevant directives and administrative decisionscommencing with

circular No. 1737/2003 dated 26.09.2003 and culminating in the subsequent

policy instruments, including RTM 141 of 2006 and RTM 855 of 2018.

42. This examination underscores a discernible evolution in the regulatory

landscape governing police promotions, vis--vis seniority adjustments,

eligibility criteria, and the implications of cadre restructuring initiatives.

43. It is evident from the material placed before this Court that as of January

1, 2003, a total of 629 vacancies existed in the rank of IPs. In an effort to

address this, a structured promotional scheme was announced by the

Respondents, operating along two distinct pathways: promotions based on

seniority and promotions based on merit. Officers who had completed twelve

years of service as SIs were deemed eligible under the seniority pathway,

which resulted in the promotion of the aforesaid 172 SIs to the rank of IPs

with effect from January 1, 2003.1

44. In parallel, an IP qualifying examination was held on September 1, 2002,

to facilitate promotions under the merit category. However, those officers

namely, those who had clocked in 12 or more years of service as SIs and

those who successfully passed this examination were initially precluded

from receiving promotions due to the writ application referred to above.2

45. Following a settlement in the said writ application, 299 SIs who had passed

the aforesaid qualifying examination were promoted to the rank of IPs with

retrospective effect from January 1, 2003. These officers were subsequently

1 Please see para 35 of this judgement. 2 Please see para 36 of this judgement.

Page 23 of 32

ranked immediately below the 172 officers who had been promoted on the

basis of seniority and pursuant to a previous examination. As a result of

these promotions, a total of 471 SIs were elevated to the rank of IPs, leaving

158 vacancies in the said cadre unfilled.

46. The Petitioners, who were also SIs at the material time, had completed over

eleven years of service in that rank by 2003. As per the RTM bearing No.

208 dated October 6, 2003, the criterion for promotion to the rank of IP was

a minimum of five years of service as an SI. Thus, the Petitioners were

indisputably qualified for promotion by the time the Respondents

undertook the process of filling the said vacancies.

47. However, despite being similarly or better situated than officers who were

promoted retrospectively to January 1, 2003, the Petitioners were excluded

from the process.

48. If a period of five years had been the requirement for promotion from the

post of SI to IP as far back as October 2003, a substantive legitimate

expectation was created by both the RTM of 208 of 06.10.2003 and upon the

corresponding circular issued to this effect namely, circular No. 1737/2003

dated 26.09.2003 which also, predicated that the vacancies in the position

of IPs would be filled with effect from 01.01.2003.

49. Despite the creation of a substantive legitimate expectation to promote the

Petitioners with effect from 01.01.2003, the Petitioners were not afforded

this benefit even after the writ application in the Court of Appeal

terminated and 299 SIs were subsequently promoted with effect from

01.01.2003. It is appropriate to recall that these Petitioners were just

immediately below the aforesaid 299 SIs who were promoted and there

remained in the cadre of IPs 158 vacancies.

Page 24 of 32

50. Further evidence presented before this Court reveals that the exclusion of

the Petitioners from consideration for promotion with effect from

01.01.2003 appears to conflict with the recommendations of the relevant

authorities, as outlined below.

51. In a letter dated August 29, 2005, the then IGP addressed the National

Police Commission, confirming that as of January 1, 2003, there had been

629 cadre vacancies in the rank of IPs. Of these, 172 promotions had been

granted based on seniority and merit, 299 on merit after the termination of

the Court of Appeal writ application, leaving 158 vacancies unfilled. The

letter explicitly acknowledged the possibility of addressing these remaining

vacancies through a special promotion scheme for officers with long-

standing service in the rank of SIs, as outlined in Circular No. 1737/2003.

This scheme expressly required only five years of service, making these

Petitioners eligible, as they had over 11 years of service in the rank of SIs.

The communication carried the implication that the Petitioners should be

the potential beneficiaries of this scheme, with promotions being backdated

to 01.01.2003.

52. Furthermore, a committee appointed by the then IGP under Circular

CRTM 724, chaired by Senior DIG Administration Mr. B.K.G. Nawaratne

and comprising DIG (Rtd.) D.S.R. Wanaguru and SSP (Rtd.) D.D.

Ranasinghe, conducted a comprehensive inquiry into the grievances of

officers, including the Petitioners. In its report dated October 26, 2010, the

Committee unequivocally recommended that the Petitioners promotions to

the rank of IP be backdated to January 1, 2003, aligning with the

promotions granted to other officers in similar circumstances.

53. The sequence of events and the recommendations placed before this Court

thus raise a pertinent question as to why the Petitioners, who satisfied the

Page 25 of 32

requisite eligibility criteria and were entitled to be considered for the

remaining 158 vacancies, were denied the benefit of retrospective

promotion. The administrative and procedural inconsistencies in the

Respondents actions have resulted in the Petitioners being placed at a

manifest disadvantage, despite being eligible for the same treatment as

their peers promoted with effect from 2003. The inequities faced by the

Petitioners are further underscored by the fact that both the IGP and the

appointed Committee recognized the merit of their claims and sought to

remedy the same by recommending backdated promotions.

54. Thus, the letter of the then IGP dated August 29,2005 and the Nawaratne

Committee Report of 2010 reinforced the substantive legitimate

expectation accruing to the Petitioners.

55. It would appear that this recommendation in the report that their

promotion to the post of IP be backdated 01.01.2003 was not implemented

by the 1st Respondent namely, the Inspector General of Police and other

Respondents.

56. It is worth recalling that long before the Nawaratne Committee issued its

recommendation and report in 2010, the Petitioners had been promoted as

IPs with effect from 01.01.2006 and not from 01.01.2003. The issue of ante-

dating their promotion with effect from 01.01.2003 had been quite live and

continued on account of the agitation and challenges mounted by the

Petitioners and it is on account of this challenge that the Nawaratne

Committee strongly recommended their promotions to be backdated with

effect from 01.01.2003.

Page 26 of 32

57. I must also hark back to the 1st complaint made by the Petitioners to the

Human Rights Commission by a letter dated 27.07.2006 to the effect that

their promotions were not being backdated with effect from 01.01.2003 and

this complaint has been acknowledged by the HRC by its letter dated

28.07.2006. This letter has been appended to the Petition evidencing the

fact that the matter has been pending before the HRC with no decision

thereon.

58. Since the 1st Respondent had failed to give effect to the recommendation

contained in the said report, there is evidence before this Court that the

Petitioners addressed a further complaint to the Human Rights

Commission complaining of the non-implementation of the said

recommendation to backdate the said promotions to the rank of IP to

01.01.2003.

59. Whilst matters remained as such, the then IGP by RTM dated 04.09.2013

called for application from eligible persons holding the rank of IPs for

promotion to the rank of CIs. The eligibility criteria stated therein was inter

alia 8 years of active service in the rank of IP as at 25.09.2013. Thereafter

by RTM 744 dated 20.09.2013, the closing date of the application under the

said RTM 141 was extended to 01.10.2013.

60. The Petitioners were not eligible to apply in terms of the said RTM 141 on

account of their effective date of promotion to the rank of IP being

01.01.2006 and not 01.01.2003, as was their entitlement and as

recommended by the aforesaid Nawaratne Committee. The Petitioners had

not served 8 years in the rank of IP as at 25.09.2013. Had their IP

Page 27 of 32

promotions been backdated to 01.01.2003, as they were rightfully entitled

to, they would have been eligible to apply for the same.

61. Even the IGPs message dated 04.09.2013 calling for applications from

eligible persons to be promoted as CIs shuts out the Petitioners from

making any application, as their promotions to the position of IPs, as

promised to them to begin from 01.01.2003, remain unfulfilled. The

jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked on 02.10.2013 with the principal

declaration being sought for their promotions as IPs to be backdated to

01.01.2003.

62. Whilst this Application was pending before this Court, the IGP at the time,

issued RTM 855 dated 27.09.2018 ordering the promotion of 14 Inspectors

of Police to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police with effect from 02.10.2017.

The said officers who were promoted in terms of the said RTM 855 were

those who had been absorbed to the regular service and placed below the

Petitioners in the order of seniority in the rank of SIs in the seniority list.

63. The said order of the then IGP communicated through the said RTM 855

dated 27.09.2018 has to be classified as completely arbitrary, capricious,

unreasonable and violative of the Petitioners' Fundamental Rights.

64. It has to be accepted that despite addressing several further appeals in this

regard, the Petitioners were not granted any administrative relief nor their

grievance in any way addressed.

65. By a motion dated 01.11.2019, the Petitioners produced before this Court

the letter dated 29.08.2005 of the then IGP, addressed to the National

Page 28 of 32

Police Commission, and the content of which has been reproduced in

paragraph 20 of the petition to this Court.

66. As pleaded in the said paragraph 20 of the petition, the said letter marked

"Z" states that:

In terms of circular bearing number 1737/03 - 629 cadre vacancies had

existed in relation to the rank of IP

From and out of the said 629 vacancies, 172 SIs have been promoted on

the basis of long service and

299 vacancies were allocated to officers who were successful at the

relevant qualifying examination and undergoing training and as such,

158 vacancies remained in the said rank of SIs

In terms of the special scheme of promotions on a one-off basis promotion

could be effected in respect of officers who had served a long period in

the post of SIs.

67. The said document marked "Z' and three other similar recommendations /

communications by former IGPs for the backdating of the appointments to

the rank of IPs as sought by the Petitioners were filed of record by the State

during the course of the proceedings in this application, and the State

conceded that whilst all these recommendations are in existence, no

instructions have been received as to what steps have been taken on the

strength of the said recommendations. [vide journal entries in this

Application dated 04.10.2023 and 17.01.2024]

68. In the circumstances, the origin of the entitlement of the Petitioners to have

their IP promotions backdated to 01.01.2003 stems from the promise

contained in circular No. 1737/2003 dated 26.09.2003.

Page 29 of 32

69. By virtue of the above letter marked Z by the Petitioners as well as several

other recommendations / communications by past IGPs to have these

promotions to IPs backdated, it is confirmed without any iota of doubt that

the said entitlement has been unequivocally recognized by successive heads

of department of the police force.

70. The said entitlement to promotion with effect from 01.01.2003 has also been

recognized and recommended by the Committee appointed by the then IGP.

71. As pointed out by me, the said Committee's report dated 26.10.2010 had

recommended inter alia that the said promotions to the rank of IPs be

backdated to 01.01.2003. This fact has not been controverted by the

Respondents.

72. If a claimant establishes that he had a legitimate expectation that has been

frustrated by a public body, the options open to a reviewing Court, as Figure

below depicts, depend, in the first place, on the content of the expectation.

Page 30 of 32

73. One possibility is that the claimant may be entitled to expect that his case

will be considered in a particular wayfor example, that he will be

consulted or be given a fair hearing. Here, the claimant has a procedural

legitimate expectation, and the most that the court can do is to require the

public body to accord to the claimant whatever procedural niceties it led

him to expect. The effect of a legitimate expectation may therefore entitle

a person to fair treatment in circumstances in which no such entitlement

would otherwise arise. Or a legitimate expectation might entitle someone

to a higher standard of fair treatment than they would otherwise be entitled

to.

74. The other possibility is that the claimant may have a substantive legitimate

expectationthat is, he may legitimately expect a particular outcome to the

decision-making process. The home for life promise in Coughlan3 gave

rise to precisely such an expectation. The court may decide that although

the expectation itself relates to a matter of substance, it should be offered

only a procedural form of protection.

75. For example, in R (Bibi) v Newham London Borough Council4 it was

held that a local authoritys promise to provide the claimant with

permanent accommodation gave rise to a substantive legitimate

expectation that such accommodation would indeed be provided. Yet when

it came to protecting the expectation, the court merely required the local

authoritywhich, in deciding that the claimant should not be offered

permanent accommodation, had ignored its earlier promiseto reconsider

3 R v. North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan (201 QB 213 at para 83) 4 2001 EWCA CIV 607

Page 31 of 32

the matter, taking due account of the legitimate expectation that it had

engendered.

76. However, the court may go further than this, as it did in Coughlan itself,

by asking whether frustrating the expectation would be so unfair as to

be a misuse of the authoritys power.5

77. By dashing the substantive legitimate expectation entertained by the

Petitioners, I take the view that failure to ante-date the promotions to

01.01.2003 is so unfair as to amount to a misuse of the power of the relevant

authorities and in the totality of the foregoing circumstances, this Court

directs that the appointments of the Petitioners as IPs should be backdated

with effect from 01.01.2003.

78. Thus, this Court reiterates that schemes of promotion in the public service

must accord with reasonableness and rationality and with this view in

mind, the public service must be conducted with a view to ensuring fair

play, fairness and maintenance of the rule of law. On several occasions this

Court has categorically declared this principle in no uncertain terms.6

National Savings Bank (1997) 1 Sri.L.R. 185; Piyasena v. People's Bank (1994) 1 Sri.L.R. 65; Abeysinghe v. Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 36; Narangoda v. Kodituwakku, Inspector General of Police (2002) 1 Sri.L.R. 247].

79. In a nutshell based on the promises and entitlements emanating from the

Circular, the Nawaratne Committee Report, the IGPs letter which affirms

it, and other recommendations as enumerated above, this Court holds that

the substantive legitimate expectation of the Petitioners has to be fulfilled

and the reliefs ordered by this Court must be implemented by the

Respondents.

80. Based on the foregoing reasons, I declare that the Respondents have

infringed the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners under Article 12 (1) by

not giving effect to the promises made to promote the Petitioners with effect

from 01.01.2003. The reliefs awarded to the Petitioners would satisfy the

ends of justice.
