"","were SIs, immediately below the 299 SIs, thus appointed as IPs with effect"
"","from 01.01.2003."
"36.","It is a well-known fact among the parties that the promotions of  172 SIs"
"","who had passed the subsequently held qualifying examination to the rank"
"","of IPs, could not be effected due to a pending application before the Court"
"","of Appeal in Case No. CA Writ/1560/03. The Court of Appeal had issued"
"","an interim order restraining promotions to the rank of IPs until the final"
"","hearing and determination of the said application."
"37.","Only after the termination of the said writ application in March 2005 were"
"","the 299 SIs promoted to the rank of IPs, with effect from 01.01.2003."
"38.","By March 2005 both the categories of SIs had been promoted as IPs with"
"","effect 
from  01.01.2003.  Contrary  to  the  arguments  presented  by  the"
"","Respondents, the Petitioners did not remain inactive. The material before"
"","this Court demonstrates that they addressed a letter dated 05.05.2005 to"
"","the then Secretary of the National Police Commission, requesting that their"
"","long  service  be  recognized  and  that  they  be  promoted  without  delay."
"","However, it appears that no response was received to this letter even at the"
"","time of filing this application before this Court."
"39.","Additionally,  other  surrounding  circumstances  clearly  indicate  that  the"
"","Petitioners had been actively agitating for their promotion to the rank of"
"","IPs, insisting that the promotion be made effective from 01.01.2003."
"40.","As  facts  which  would  be  recited  presently  demonstrate,  the  Petitioners"
"","acted promptly, and the alleged violation stemming from an inaction they"
"","claim, appears to have persisted continuously."
