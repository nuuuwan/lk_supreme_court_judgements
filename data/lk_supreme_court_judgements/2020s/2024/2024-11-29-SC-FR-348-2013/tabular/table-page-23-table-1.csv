"","ranked immediately below the 172 officers who had been promoted on the"
"","basis of seniority and pursuant to a previous examination. As a result of"
"","these promotions, a total of 471 SIs were elevated to the rank of IPs, leaving"
"","158 vacancies in the said cadre unfilled."
"46.","The Petitioners, who were also SIs at the material time, had completed over"
"","eleven years of service in that rank by 2003. As per the RTM bearing No."
"","208 dated October 6, 2003, the criterion for promotion to the rank of IP was"
"","a  minimum  of  five  years  of  service  as  an  SI.  Thus,  the  Petitioners  were"
"","indisputably  qualified 
for  promotion  by 
the 
time 
the  Respondents"
"","undertook the process of filling the said vacancies."
"47.","However, despite being similarly or better situated than officers who were"
"","promoted retrospectively to January 1, 2003, the Petitioners were excluded"
"","from the process."
"48.","If a period of five years had been the requirement for promotion from the"
"","post  of  SI  to  IP  as  far  back  as  October  2003,  a  substantive  legitimate"
"","expectation was created by both the RTM of 208 of 06.10.2003 and upon the"
"","corresponding circular issued to this effect namely, circular No. 1737/2003"
"","dated 26.09.2003 which also, predicated that the vacancies in the position"
"","of IPs would be filled with effect from 01.01.2003."
"49.","Despite the creation of a substantive legitimate expectation to promote the"
"","Petitioners with effect from 01.01.2003, the Petitioners were not afforded"
"","this  benefit  even  after 
the  writ  application 
in 
the  Court  of  Appeal"
"","terminated  and  299  SIs  were  subsequently  promoted  with  effect  from"
"","01.01.2003.  It  is  appropriate  to  recall  that  these  Petitioners  were  just"
"","immediately  below  the  aforesaid  299  SIs  who  were  promoted  and  there"
"","remained in the cadre of IPs 158 vacancies."
