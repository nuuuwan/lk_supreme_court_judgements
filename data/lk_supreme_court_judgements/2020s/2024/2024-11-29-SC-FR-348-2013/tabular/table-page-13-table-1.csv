"5.","A further RTM to the Circular, bearing No. RTM 208 dated October 6, 2003"
"","stipulated eligibility based on a minimum of five years of service as a SI."
"","As at that date, these Petitioners, who had already served as SIs for over a"
"","decade, met the requisite eligibility criteria but as is borne out, only those"
"","SIs  with  12  years  of  service  were  promoted  under  Circular  bearing  No."
"","1737/2003."
"6.","At the time of issuance of Circular No. 1737/2003, 172 SIs who had already"
"","completed  over  12  years  of  service  in  the  rank  of  SI  were  selected  for"
"","promotion to the rank of IP pursuant to the qualifying examination held in"
"","2002 and began undergoing training in preparation for their appointment."
"7.","However,  these  promotions  contemplated  under  Circular  No.  1737/2003"
"","were  delayed  due  to  the  pendency  of  legal  proceedings  in  CA  Writ  No."
"","1560/03, resulting in a stay order that halted the promotion process. Upon"
"","the conclusion of the writ application in March 2005, 299 SIs were promoted"
"","to the rank of IP, retrospectively, with effect from January 1, 2003."
"8.","Thus,  it  could  be  seen  while  172  SIs  were  promoted  as  IPs  based  on"
"","seniority  and  merit,  299  SIs  were  promoted  as 
IPs  on  merit.  The"
"","appointment  of  these  two  categories  of  officers  were  made  effect  from"
"","January 1, 2003. It has to be noted the Petitioners who has neither passed"
"","the exam nor had 12 years of service were however, below these categories"
"","of SIs who became IPs with effect from 2003."
"9.","While the position of these Petitioners stood as above another development"
"","took  place  as  regards  Police  officers  in  the  Reserve  Service  of  the  Police"
"","Department.  The  Cabinet  took a  decision on February  1,  2006,  to absorb"
"","the reserve police officers into the regular service of the Police Force. This"
"","Cabinet  decision  also  provided  that  these  reserve 
force  officers  thus"
