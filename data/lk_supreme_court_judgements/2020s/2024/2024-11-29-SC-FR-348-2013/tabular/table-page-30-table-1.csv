"73.","One possibility is that the claimant may be entitled to expect that his case"
"","will  be  considered  in  a  particular  wayâ€”for  example,  that  he  will  be"
"","consulted or be given a fair hearing. Here, the claimant has a  procedural"
"","legitimate expectation, and the most that the court can do is to require the"
"","public  body  to  accord  to  the  claimant  whatever  procedural  niceties  it  led"
"","him to expect. The effect of a legitimate expectation may therefore entitle"
"","a person to fair treatment in circumstances in which no such entitlement"
"","would otherwise arise. Or a legitimate expectation might entitle someone"
"","to a higher standard of fair treatment than they would otherwise be entitled"
"","to."
