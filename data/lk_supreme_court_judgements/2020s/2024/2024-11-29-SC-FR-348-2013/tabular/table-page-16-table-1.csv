"17.","In  an effort  to  resolve  this issue,  the Petitioners lodged  multiple  appeals"
"","and representations with the IGP and the National Police Commission."
"","The Committee appointed by the IGP and its report"
"18.","In response, the IGP appointed a committee comprising senior officers to"
"","investigate the matter. In 2010, the committee issued a report confirming"
"","the Petitioners’ eligibility for retrospective promotions to January 1, 2003,"
"","and  attributed  the  delay  solely  to  the  pendency  of  the  writ  proceedings."
"","Despite  the  committee’s  recommendations,  the  Petitioners  aver  that  the"
"","Respondents failed to take corrective action, leaving them in a position of"
"","inequity."
"19.","The  Petitioners 
further  contend  that  this 
failure  on  the  part  of  the"
"","Respondents created an untenable situation wherein officers absorbed from"
"","the reserve police service and those promoted retroactively gained undue"
"","seniority  over  them.  This  anomaly  has  had  a  lasting  impact  on  their"
"","professional  standing  within  the  Police  Department  and  has  inflicted"
"","considerable prejudice upon them."
"20.","The Petitioners lodged complaints with the Human Rights Commission of"
"","Sri  Lanka  (“HRC”) under  case numbers  HRC  4213/06  and  HRC  5324/07."
"","While the HRC acknowledged the delay in promotions, it has yet to issue a"
"","final determination, leaving the Petitioners without any effective recourse."
"21.","Thus,  the  Petitioners  invoke  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  seeking  as"
"","substantive relief inter alia:"
"","1. to declare that the Petitioners are eligible to apply to be selected for"
