"","their  Petition,  the  Petitioners  collectively  possessed  over  two  decades  of"
"","distinguished 
service, 
characterized 
by 
unblemished 
conduct 
and"
"","dedication to duty."
"2.","Notwithstanding  their  extensive  tenure,  the  Petitioners  allege  that  their"
"","career progression has been unjustly constrained, having received only two"
"","promotions during their service periods: the first, to the rank of Inspector"
"","of Police (“IP”), effective from January 1, 2006, and the second, for certain"
"","Petitioners, to the rank of Chief Inspector (“CI”) on subsequent occasions."
"3.","The pith and substance of the Petitioners' complaint arises from the alleged"
"","delay  and  misapplication  of  the  promotional  framework  governing  their"
"","advancement. In particular, the Petitioners contend that their promotions"
"","to  the  rank  of  IP  ought  to  have  been  backdated  to  January  1,  2003,  in"
"","accordance  with  Circular  No.  1737/2003,  which 
introduced  a  “Special"
"","Scheme of Promotion.” The Petitioners further argue that this purported"
"","delay has adversely impacted their eligibility for subsequent promotions,"
"","including to the rank of CI, thereby causing significant prejudice to their"
"","career trajectories. They now seek equitable relief from this Court to rectify"
"","these grievances."
