Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the Commercial High Court seeking a

declaration that the resolution passed by the board of directors of the 1st

defendant Bank dated 29.05.2013 to sell the mortgaged property by

parate execution in terms of section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, as amended, is unlawful and

therefore a nullity. Pending determination of the action, the court issued

an interim injunction preventing the Bank from proceeding with the

auction. The Bank is before this court against the said order.

Although the resolution had been passed to recover a sum of Rs.

5,443,787/47 together with the interest, the plaintiff by reference to

documents issued by the Bank marked P3 and P4 has pointed out that,

at the time the resolution was passed, the balance of the principal

amount borrowed was less than Rs. five million–to be exact Rs.

4,024,582/37. The Bank does not dispute this fact before this court.

The contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff is, at the time of

default, if the balance of the principal amount borrowed was less than

Rs. five million, the Bank cannot resort to parate execution.

Admittedly, the principal amount borrowed was Rs. nine million. It is the

contention of learned President’s Counsel for the Bank that the Bank can

4

SC/APPEAL/219/2016

resort to parate execution, if the principal amount borrowed is more than

Rs. five million.

The short matter to be decided by this court is which argument should

prevail.

This court in Nanayakkara v. Hatton National Bank PLC [2017] BLR 95

held that the argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff should prevail.

However, learned President’s Counsel for the Bank submits that it does

not represent the correct position of the law. I regret my inability to agree

with learned President’s Counsel for the Bank.

Section 5A was introduced to the principal Act, No. 4 of 1990, by Act No.

1 of 2011. Section 5A was further amended by Act No. 19 of 2011. Section

5A(1), as presently constituted, reads as follows:

5A(1) No action shall be initiated in terms of section 3 of the principal

enactment for the recovery of any loan in respect of which default is

made, nor shall any steps be taken in terms of section 4 or section 5

of the aforesaid Act, where the principal amount borrowed of such

loan is less than rupees five million:

Provided however, at the time of default when calculating the

principal amount borrowed due and owing to the Bank on the loan

granted to such defaulter, the interest accrued on such loan and any

penalty imposed thereon, shall not be taken into consideration.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Bank relies on section 5A(1) to

contend that, when the principal amount borrowed is more than Rs. five

million, as in this case, the Bank can resort to parate execution. He

argues, in such circumstances, the proviso to section 5A(1) has no

applicability. He further argues that the proviso is applicable in

calculating the principal amount borrowed when a borrower has obtained

5

SC/APPEAL/219/2016

multiple facilities secured by a mortgage. This convoluted argument is

against the plain meaning of the proviso to section 5A(1).

For the purpose of section 5A, a Bank is not permitted to aggregate

multiple loan facilities, all secured by the same mortgage, in order to

surpass the threshold of Rs. five million. The principal amount of each

loan facility should exceed Rs. five million.

The proviso to section 5A(1) needs no interpretation; it is self-explanatory.

It states (a) at the time of default (b) when calculating the principal

amount borrowed due and owing to the Bank (c) on the loan granted to

such defaulter, (d) the interest accrued on such loan and any penalty

imposed thereon, shall not be taken into consideration.

The calculation has to be done at the point of default, and at that point,

the principal amount borrowed due and owing to the Bank on the loan

granted, should exceed Rs. five million.

Learned counsel for both parties restricted the argument to the following

question of law:

When the capital to be recovered is less than Rs. five million as at

the date of resolution, can the Bank resort to parate execution?

I answer this question in the negative.

The order of the Commercial High Court dated 19.11.2014 is affirmed

and the appeal is dismissed with costs.
