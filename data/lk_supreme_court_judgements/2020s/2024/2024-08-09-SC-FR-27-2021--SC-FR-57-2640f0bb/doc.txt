Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Several Petitioners have come before this Court challenging the recommendations of the

Commission of Inquiry appointed by His Excellency the President under the Commission of Inquiry

Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended) and warrant published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary

2157/44 dated 09.01.2020 and Government Gazette Extraordinary 2159/16 dated 22.01.2020. As

per warrant published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary 2157/44 dated 09.01.2020, His

Excellency the President had appointed;

1. Hon. Upaly Abeyrathne

2. Hon. Daya Chandrasiri Jayathilaka and

3. Chandra Fernando

52

as Commissioners to inquire into the incidents of Political Victimization that comes within the

purview identified in the said warrant during the period commencing from the 8th January 2015

and ending on the 16th December 2019.

With the handing over of the findings and recommendations of the said Commission, several

Petitions were filed before this Court challenging the recommendations made with regard to the

Petitioners who had complained before this Court, about the alleged violation and/or imminent

violations of their fundamental rights by submitting recommendations and/or by taking steps to

implement such recommendations.

Since the grievance complained by the several Petitioners and the relief claimed were almost

identical, His Lordship the Chief Justice had nominated the present bench in the first instance to

consider the merits of each application in order to grant leave to proceed and to hear and

determine the applications if the merits of the applications warrant granting leave to proceed.

As revealed before this Court, the following Petitioners have come before this Court challenging

the recommendations of the said Commission of Inquiry.

1. Padmini Nirmala Ranawaka Gunathilake SC FRA 27/2021

2. Susith Malinga Bandara Weerasekara SC FRA 57/2021

3. Ekanayake Mudiyanselage Somisara Bandara Ekanayake SC FRA 58/2021

4. Dukganna Walawwe Ravindra Bandara Senevirathne SC FRA 74/2021

5. Kurukulasuriya Mudiyanselage Ananda Wijayapala SC FRA 80/2021

6. Upul Jayasuriya SC FRA 115/2021

7. Travis Jeramy Liyanduru Sinniah SC FRA 125/2021

8. Kamalagoda Mudalige Sandya Priyangani Ekaneligoda SC FRA 126/2021

9. Gnanendra Shani Abysekera SC FR 132/2021

When these matters were supported for granting of leave to proceed, Mr. Ikram Mohomed PC who

represented the 1-3rd Respondents, the three Commissioners of the Commission of Inquiry, raised

a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of these applications based on the

ground that there was no Executive or Administrative decision taken by the three Commissioners

and therefore this Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain the instant applications filed under

53

Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) for the alleged violation of the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners.

This Court after giving due consideration to the preliminary objection raised and the submissions

made on behalf of the Petitioners, had decided to grant leave to proceed for the alleged violation

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, and had also decided to consider the preliminary objection

when the main matters are decided by this Court and I will be dealing with the said objection now.

The 1stto 3rd Respondents have raised a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of this court on the

ground that the Petitioners cannot maintain the present fundamental right applications as the

actions/ decisions and recommendations of the 1st- 3rd Respondents do not constitute executive or

administrative actions within the meaning of Article 126(1) read with Article 17 of the

Constitution.

Article 17 and 126(1) of the Constitution provide as follows:

Article 17: Every person shall entitled to apply to the Supreme Court, as provided by Article

126, in respect of the infringement or imminent infringement, by executive or administrative

action, of a fundamental right to which such person is entitled under the provisions of this

chapter

Art 126(1): The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and

determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive

or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognized

by chapter III or IV.

Whilst Article 17 of the Constitution empowers every person to apply to Supreme Court as

provided by Article 126, in respect of infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental right

to which such person is entitled under the provisions of Chapter III, Article 126 of the Constitution

confers on the Supreme Court the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and dispose all fundamental

rights applications.

However as executive or administrative action has not been defined in the Constitution, the

Courts have sought to define and interpret what is meant by executive or administrative action.

54

In Perera vs University Grant Commission1 Sharvananda J. noted that

Fundamental rights operate only between individuals and the state. In the context of

fundamental rights, the state includes every repository of state power. The expression

executive or administrative action embraces executive action for the state or its agencies or

instrumentalities exercising governmental functions. It refers to exertion of governmental

powers in all forms.

Even though the reference in the above case was to state power in all its forms and

instrumentalities, our Courts have adopted a conservative approach in the early stages of the

development of the fundamental right jurisdiction.

In the case of Wijethunga vs Insurance Corporation2 it was contended that,

The term executive action comprehends official actions of all Government Officers. Difficult

problems arise when the label is sought to be affixed to the conduct of private individuals

with whom Government is somehow involved ", who allegedly exercise Government

authority. Delegation of a State function to a party may make the party's action/the action

of the Government and thus make the State responsible for such action. The decisive

question is, what is the involvement of the State, in the activity of the party concerned.

When private individuals or groups are endowed by the State with power or functions,

governmental in nature, they become agencies or instrumentalities, of the State subject to

the constitutional inhibitions of the State.

In the said case the test for executive or administrative action was held not to have satisfied as

the insurance corporation which engaged in the insurance business was not seen as engaging in

functions of governmental nature.

Over the years our Courts have moved firmly towards adopting a test that focused on the element

of overall level of governmental control, control based test, in order to determine whether the

entity whose conduct was impugned was an instrumentality of the government.

Thus, in Rajaratne vs Air Lanka3 the Supreme Court pronounced that the expression executive or

administrative action should be given a broad construction and not restrictive meaning. Here

1 [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 128 at 137-138 2 [1982] 1 Sri LR at 5-6.

55

Court held that although the functions of Air Lanka was not governmental, it was considered to be

engaged in executive or administrative actions.

Here Atukorale J. observed

But by resorting to this device of the corporate entity, the government cannot be permitted

to liberate itself from its constitutional obligations in respect of fundamental rights which it

and its organs are enjoyed to respect, secure and advance. In the circumstances I am of the

opinion that the expression 'executive or administrative action' in Articles 17 and 126 of the

Constitution should be given a broad and not a restrictive construction.4

In Leo Samson vs Sri Lanka Air Lines LTD and Others,5 the Court emphasized that the appropriate

test was the deep and pervasive control test to determine whether the acts complained fall within

the ambit of executive or administrative actions. However, it is important to note that existence of

deep and pervasive control is only one of several factors to be considered. This was made clear by

Bhagawati J. in Ramana vs International Airport Authority of India 6and Ajay Hasia vs Khalid

Mujib7. In Ramana vs International Airport Authority of India (supra) Bhagawati J. emphasized

that

No one single factor will yield a satisfactory answer to the question and the court will have

to consider cumulative effect of these various factors and arrive at its decision on the basis

of a particularized inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each case.8

In Jayakody vs. Sri Lanka Insurance and Robinson Hotel Company Ltd9, Fernando J. held that, a

duly incorporated limited liability Company which carried on a solely commercial enterprise was an

agency or instrumentality of the State if the State had effective ownership and control of that

Company. In the said case His Lordship made the following observation;

The chain of ownership and control may extend indefinitely: e.g. the State may set up a

corporation which it (in substance) owns and controls; that corporation may set up a limited

3 [1987] 2 Sri LR 128. 4 Ibid 146. 5 [2001] 1 Sri LR 94. 6 AIR 1979 SC 1628. 7 AIR 1981 SC 487 at 496. 8 AIR 1979 SC 1628 at 1642. 9 [2001] 1 Sri LR 365.

56

liability company which it (in substance) owns and controls; and that company in turn may

set up another company or other entity . . . and so on. But however long the chain may be, if

ultimately it is the State which has effective ownership and control, all those entities - every

link in that chain - are State agencies. I hold that the 2nd Respondent is a State agency. Even

if it was performing purely commercial functions, it would nevertheless be a State agency,

albeit a State agency performing commercial functions.10

In Jayasinghe vs Attorney General 11the Court held that,

The co-operative employees commission established by parliament consists of members

appointed by the executive; in regard to appointment, dismissal and disciplinary control. It

has powers which are in some way comparable to public service commission, though

certainly not as extensive. The Co-operative Employees Commission Act No 12 of 1972 was

enacted to make special provisions in respect of employees of co-operative societies; and

the commission has the powers under sec 11 to determine all the matters with regarding

recruitment and promotion (including qualifications, examinations, salary scales and terms

and conditions of service) and the procedure in regard to disciplinary actions

.

The powers of a co-operative society in relation to its employees are thus subject to the

statute, the regulations made thereunder, and the directions of the commission, disciplinary

action and dismissal are subject to appeal or review by the commission. Employees of co-

operative society thus enjoy a status, in relevant respects similar to that of public officers;

their position is significantly different to that of private sector employees. Disciplinary action

is governed by statutory provisions rather than by contracts.

I hold that disciplinary action by a co-operative society-interdiction, framing charges,

holding inquiries and dismissal is administrative action within the meaning of art 126.

[Emphasis added]

In the case of Captain Channa D.L. Abeygunawardene vs Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Others12

Prasanna Jayawardene J. having analyzed the development of the interpretation of executive and

administrative action held as follows; 10 Ibid 373. 11 [1994] 2 Sri LR 74 at 81.

57

Drawing from the aforesaid decisions of this Court and Indian decisions, some of the

identifying characteristics which show a corporate body to be an agency or instrumentality

of the State, may be collated as follows:

(i) The State, either directly or indirectly, having ownership of the corporate

body or a substantial stake in the ownership of the corporate body;

(ii) The corporate body performing functions of public importance which are

closely related to Governmental functions;

(iii) The corporate body having taken over the functions of a Department of the

State;

(iv) The State having deep and pervasive control of the corporate body;

(v) The State having the power to appoint Directors and Officers of the corporate

body;

(vi) The State providing a substantial amount of financial assistance to the

corporate body;

(vii) The corporate body transferring its profits to the State;

(viii) The State deriving benefits from the operation of the corporate body;

(ix) The State providing benefits, concessions or assistance to the corporate body

which are usually granted to organs of the State ;

(x) The Accounts of the corporate body being subject to audit by the Auditor

General or having to be submitted to the State or an official of the State;

(xi) The State having conferred a monopoly or near monopoly in its field of

business to the corporate body or the State protecting such a monopoly or

near monopoly;

(xii) Officers of the corporate body enjoying immunity from suit for acts done in

their official capacity.

Having laid out the above characteristics, Prasanna Jayawardene J. proceeds to state as follows;

Although I have, for purposes of easy reference, set out the above list of some of the

identifying characteristics of a corporate body which is an agency or instrumentality of the

12 (SC/FR/57/2016 SC Minutes of 20th January 2017).

58

State, it is important to keep in mind that, this list is by no means exhaustive. Further, it

must be stressed that, the presence of one or more of these identifying characteristics does

not, necessarily, lead to the conclusion that a corporate body is an agency or instrumentality

of the State. Instead, it is, usually, the cumulative effect of some of these identifying

characteristics being found in a corporate body, which leads to the conclusion that it is an

agency or instrumentality of the State.

In situations of ambiguity, a clear fallback solution is provided in the following cases is that acts

under the colour of office, would be administrative actions.

In Faiz vs Attorney General13 the Court stated that,

Executive is appropriate in a constitution, and sufficient to include the (official) acts of all

public officers, high and low and to exclude acts which are plainly legislative or judicial (and

of course purely private acts not done under colour of office). The need for including

administrative is because there are residual acts which do not fit neatly into this three- fold

classification. Thus, it may be uncertain whether delegated legislation is legislative and

therefore outside the scope of Articles 126, however delegated legislation is appropriately

termed administrative, although it has both legislative and executive features (cf Ramupillai

vs Perera and Jayantha vs AG)...

Executive or administrative action includes, but is wider than the acts of public [i.e.

executive or administrative] officer ; it includes not only acts done under authority flowing

from an employer- employee relationship with the state, but the acts done by virtue of

authority conferred in any matter -in writing or orally, expressly or impliedly.

In the case of Prameswary Jayathevan vs Attorney General 14Mark Fernando J. observed that,

The word administrative is significant and cannot be treated as mere superfluity. The

classification of governments powers is not always easy; there are grey areas of

uncertainty, as well as residual and ancillary powers which analytically or historically do not

fit neatly into one of the traditional categories (see, for instance, AG vs Liyanage, where an

essentially administrative power was held to be ancillary to the judicial power.) Accordingly

13 [1995] 1 Sri LR 372 at 381. 14 [1992] 2 Sri LR 356 at 371.

59

these powers which cannot appropriately classified as legislative, judicial or executive, but

are nevertheless administrative in a public law sense, are also included in the phrase

executive and administrative. Thus the question whether an act falls within the ambit of

this expression cannot be determined on assumption that it includes all exertions of state

powers or the performance of governmental power of function; nor on the basis that if

particular institutions, functionaries or officials are legislative or judicial their acts are

necessarily excluded. In the scheme of the constitution, as laid out in Articles 3 and 4, one of

the powers of the government is the judicial power of the people; the judiciary thus exercises

a governmental power of function

In my view, therefore the test must always be whether the impugned act was executive or

administrative, not whether the institution or person concerned can be characterized as

executive (or governmental which is often used as if it were equivalent.) of course,

reference to the executive character of such institution or person, and the degree of

executive control may be justifiable, and necessary, in the borderline cases, but ultimately

the decision must depend on whether the act is executive or administrative in character,

and not upon the status of the institution or the official.

Our Courts have consistently adopted a liberal approach and afforded a purposive interpretation to

the term executive or administrative actions in Article 17 and Article 126 of the Constitution over

the time is evident further in cases such as Guneratne vs Ceylon Petroleum corporation15,

Wickramatunga vs Anuruddha Ratwatte16 and Wijenayake vs Air Lanka.17

Now I shall turn to discuss whether the Commission of Inquiry established under Act No 17 of 1948

(as amended) carrying on functions that come within the purview of executive or administrative

action as contemplated in Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution.

The Respondents claim that the nature and functions of the said Commission of Inquiry were quasi-

judicial in nature and that quasi-judicial functions are not amenable to the fundamental rights

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, purportedly as they do not fall within the scope and ambit of

executive or administrative actions.

15 [1996] 1 Sri LR 315. 16 [1998] 1 Sri LR 201. 17 [1990] 1 Sri LR 293.

60

However, this claim is misconceived and erroneous as Commission of Inquiry is investigative or fact

finding in nature and is incapable of making any binding decisions that have any effect on the rights

of the parties which makes it starkly different from judicial tribunal which is capable of making

decisions that are both binding and enforceable subject to appeal.

Any finding or recommendation made by the Commission of Inquiry at the conclusion of the inquiry

is wholly dependent on the executive or administrative branch of the government for its

implementation. Until the executive implements any findings or recommendations made by a

Commission of Inquiry, such findings or recommendations have no force or avail in law. Therefore,

it could be said that powers and functions exercised by the said Commission is neither judicial nor

quasi- judicial in nature.

The Respondents further claim that Powers, functions, authority vested in the said Commission of

Inquiry which the 1st to 3rd Respondents are the chairman and members is not an agency or

instrumentality of the state as per the Commission of Inquiry Act No 17 of 1948 and therefore not

amenable to judicial review under Article 126 of the Constitution.

However it is important to note that the then Executive President appointed 1st -3rd Respondents as

the members of the said Commission of Inquiry to investigate matters of Political Victimization that

allegedly occurred during the period 08/01/2015- 16/12/2019 by way of a warrant published in the

Government (Extra-ordinary) Gazette notification bearing No 2157/44 dated 09/01/2020 by virtue

of powers vested in him qua President of the Republic, under the Commission of Inquiry Act No 17

of 1948 (as amended) read together with Article 33(2) of the Constitution, under the seal of the

Republic. The terms of Reference and/or mandate and/or scope of the inquiry of the said

Commission was determined and stipulated by the Executive President. Accordingly, the source of

power of the said Commission of Inquiry and/or its members was clearly the Executive President.

Since the said Commission of Inquiry was created and/or brought into existence for the purpose of

executing the said mandate of the President, the Commission was in fact an instrumentality and/or

agent of then President/ government and conducted themselves as such and consequently their

actions vis a vis the Petitioners, were executive in nature.

Therefore, the contention that the said Commission of Inquiry is not an instrumentality or agency

of the government is untenable.

61

The said purported report of the Commission of Inquiry had thereafter been handed over to the

then President by the 1st to 3rd Respondents on 08/12/2020. Pursuant to the said purported

findings and recommendations made by the said Commission of Inquiry against the Petitioners, the

then President submitted the report of the Commission containing the same, for approval to the

Cabinet of Ministers by way of a Cabinet Memorandum dated 15/01/2021. The Cabinet of

Ministers had in pursuance thereof, approved the implementation of the said purported findings

and recommendations made by the said Commission of Inquiry against the Petitioners. The said

actions of the Cabinet of Ministers in approving the implementation of the purported findings and

recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry against the Petitioners clearly constitute of

executive actions within the meaning of Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution.

Moreover, according to the wording of Section 18 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, immunity

granted to the members of the Commission is specifically limited to the civil and criminal

proceedings and it does not extend to fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court which is of sui

generis nature.

In the case of Saman vs Leeeladasa 18 Court held that

However, our court has preferred to treat a violation of fundamental right as something sui

generis created by the constitution and not as delict.

Further it does not contain any ouster with regard to the fundamental right jurisdiction vested with

this Court. Accordingly, there is no basis whatsoever to exclude the conduct of the Commission

from the review of the Court under Article 126 of the Constitution read with Article 17 and

therefore the preliminary objection taken by 1st -3rd Respondent pertaining to the jurisdiction of

the Court ought to be dismissed.

As revealed before this Court, the warrant issued on the 9th January 2020 under the hand of the

Secretary to His Excellency the President, by order of His Excellency the President contained

specific directions as to the matters that need to be inquired into by the three Commissioners.

In the said warrant the cause for the Political Victimization and the mandate of the Commission of

Inquiry had been identified separately as follows;

18 [1989] 1 Sri LR 1 at 35.

62

Cause for the Political Victimization;

That several persons including public officers who have held or continue to hold office in

the institutions that are alleged to have been manipulated in furtherance of the alleged

Political Victimization have publicly express that such process of Political Victimization

was instigated through a special unit dealing with Anti-Corruption, operating under the

purview of the Prime Minister during the aforesaid period of alleged political

victimization;

That the said Anti-Corruption unit first decided on who should be investigated and

thereafter referred complaints to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police

and/or the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police, during the

aforesaid period;

That several complaints lodged by the public before the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of

the Sri Lanka Police and/or the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka

Police have gone unheeded;

That the alleged process of Political Victimization has created a substantial negative

impact on the performance of public officers, employees of public corporations and

members of the armed forces and police service, and as a result, such officers,

employees and members have shown and show reluctance to take decisions while

discharging their duties and prefer to adopt a passive approach towards work, thereby

causing a prejudicial impact on the functions of government.

Mandate of the Commission of Inquiry;

a) Whether there has been malpractice or irregularity, or non-compliance with or

disregard of the proper prudence, norms, guidelines, procedures and best practices

applicable in relation to the administration of the Commission to Investigate Allegations

of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the

Sri Lanka Police and/or the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka

Police;

63

b) Whether any investigations by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka

Police or the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police had been

influenced or obstructed or prevented in any manner, resulting in loss, damage, injury

or detriment, either direct or imputed to any person or persons;

c) Whether any officer entrusted with conduct of investigations by the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes

Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police and/or the Police Special

Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police have acted under undue influence by

third parties, including the said Anti-Corruption unit;

d) Whether any person had committed any act of political victimization, misuse or abuse of

power, corruption or any fraudulent act in relation to the functions of the said Anti-

Corruption unit, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

(CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police or the

Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police, or in relation to the

administration of any law or the administration of justice;

Subsequent to the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry by Gazette Extraordinary 2157/44

dated 09.01.2020 another Gazette was issued under the hand of the Secretary to His Excellency the

President expanding the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry by inserting the following areas as

referred to in the warrant published in the Government Gazette Extra Ordinary 2159/16 date 20th

January 2020,

. insert the term Criminal Investigation Department in all relevant places in addition to

the agencies referred to at (a) to (d) of the aforesaid warrant and further insert the

following in addition to the matters to be inquired into and information obtained in relation

there to as referred to at (a) to (d) thereof viz;

e) Of the complaints made to the said Agencies during the period commencing 8th January

2015 and ending on 16th November 2019.

To ascertain all complaints the investigation of which was first allegedly decided upon

by the Investigation unit referred to in the warrant and thereafter investigation initiated

and those complaints made in relation to officers of the Tri-forces and Sri Lanka Police

64

that affect the national security and in the case of inquiries, investigations and legal

proceedings held causing prejudice to some person in the administration of laws or

administration of Justice due to pressure being exerted by a third party and in the case

of inquiries, investigations and legal proceedings held in relation to the Tri-forces and Sri

Lanka Police and the Public Service affecting the National Security and/or where

prejudice was deemed to have been caused in any manner whatsoever and take

immediate necessary measures to prevent prejudice being caused and National Security

and Public Services being adversely affected.

As revealed before us the term of the said Commission of Inquiry was initially for a period of six

months but it was extended by four months on 09.07.2020 and once again from 09.11.2020 for a

period of sixteen days until 25th November 2020. The Commission of Inquiry had its public sitting

after receiving complaints and its recommendations were handed over to His Excellency the

President somewhere in December 2020.

Making the complaints by ways of filing the instant applications before this Court, the Petitioners

have taken different positions in challenging the recommendations said to have been made by the

Commission of Inquiry. As submitted on behalf of the Petitioners, some Petitioners were totally

unaware of the proceedings conducted against them and some were noticed but no opportunity

was given for them to answer the allegations. None of the parties represented before this Court

were able to submit the complete recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry but the

individual Petitioners were able to submit portions of the said report with recommendation made

against them. However, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the three Commissioners

did not challenge the material tendered in individual Petitions but took up the position that his

clients do not have copies of their report since the reports had been already submitted to His

Excellency the President.

Based on the material placed before this Court I will now proceed to identify the complaints made

by the individual Petitioners in their respective applications filed before this Court.

SC FR 27/2021

The Petitioner Padmini Nirmala Ranawaka Gunathilake is a retired High Court Judge who had come

before this Court alleging that her fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12 (1), 13 (1)

65

(2) (3) and (4) violated by the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry comprising of the 1st

to 3rd Respondents.

As submitted by the Petitioner, His Lordship the Chief Justice had nominated her along with two

High Court Judges as members of a Trial at Bar, concerning the Indictment forwarded by the Hon.

Attorney General for the murder of a political figure Baratha Lakshman Premachandra and four

others. The trial proceeded before the Trial at Bar and by the majority judgment of the Trial at Bar

where the Petitioner and another judge concurring, five accused including the former Member of

Parliament Duminda Silva were found guilty and were sentenced to death. The five accused who

were found guilty by the Trial at Bar had appealed to the Supreme Court against the said Judgment

and as the Petitioner was informed, the Supreme Court had dismissed the appeals preferred by the

said accused and affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the Trial at Bar.

Even after the appeals preferred by the said accused were dismissed, and long after the retirement

of the Petitioner from her service, somewhere around January 2020 several audio recordings were

released and/or leaked to the electronic and social media where Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake, another

political figure and an actor said to have involved in conversation with some officials including the

Petitioner.

With regard to the said conversations the Petitioner has submitted in paragraph 47 of her affidavit

the following;

47. In the aforesaid circumstances, I state that, to the best of my recollection and belief,

I had no dealings, conversations or exchanges with Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake, other

than those described hereinabove, and I specially reiterate that:

a) I had not personally met or associated with Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake prior to

13/05/2016, which too was on the said solitary occasion of the said wedding

reception hosted by the then Minister of Justice, Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe to

celebrate the marriage of his son. (On 13/05/2016)

b) Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake had contacted me via telephone on only one (01)

occasion before the said Judgment in the said High Court Trial-at-Bar case

bearing No. H.C. 7781/2015 was delivered;

66

c) The said telephone call was very brief, in view of the fact that I terminated

the said call prematurely, even though Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake did not

attempt to influence me in respect of any matters relevant to the said Trial-

at-Bar case.

d) Except on the said date of 13/05/2016, I have neither met, nor associated

with Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake in person;

e) Any telephone conversations that the Petitioner had with Mr. Ranjan

Ramanayake, in respect of being elevated to the Hon. Court of Appeal and

the expression of her personal views, grievances and frustrations relating

thereto, occurred (to best of the Petitioners recollection) more towards the

latter part of 2017 and/or from or around April to end 2017, which is over at

least 07 months after the said Judgment in the said High Court Trial-at-Bar

case bearing No. H.C. 7781/2015, was delivered by her;

f) The Petitioner was totally unaware that Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake was

recording the said telephone calls he made to the Petitioner.

In January 2020 the Petitioner was summoned before the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) and a

statement was recorded on the 20thJanuary 2020 with regard to the alleged telephone

conversations said to have taken place between the Petitioner and Mr. Ranjan Ramanayake. The

Petitioner was not informed of any criminal proceedings with regard to the statement recorded

from her up to date.

The Petitioner was aware of the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry by His Excellency the

President somewhere in January 2020 but was unaware of any proceedings taken place before the

said Commission of Inquiry until a media statement issued by the President's media division on or

around 8th December 2020 announcing that the said Commission had submitted its final report to

His Excellency the President.

On 11th January 2021 the Petitioner got to know of some news items said to have published against

her had browsed through relatively unknown news website calling itself THE LEADER which

published a news report on 01st January 2022 titled Relief for Duminda Silva- Allegations against

Ranjan, Shani and Padmini- Presidential Commission makes recommendations.

67

The said news published in the said website contained portion of the alleged final report of the said

Commission consist of five pages of the final report including the decision and recommendations

made against the Petitioner in respect of a complaint said to have made by the 38th Respondent to

the Commission of Inquiry.

Among the five pages of the final report published in the website, the inquiry said to have

proceeded against the Petitioner was referred to as follows;

However all her efforts to obtain a copy of the recommendation made against her by the said

Commission of Inquiry was failed but she had reasons to believe that, what was published in the

69

said website was in fact a copy of the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry submitted to

his Excellency the President.

As submitted by the Petitioner, the Commission of Inquiry had not afforded any opportunity for the

Petitioner to defend herself before the said Commission of Inquiry before making any

recommendation against herself even though the Commission of Inquiry is under a duty to act

fairly and to adhere to the principles of natural justice.

SC FR 57/ 2021

The Petitioner Susith Maliya Bandara Weerasekara who is a retired Vice Admiral of Sri Lanka Navy

had complained of the violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution by making recommendations to the effect that,

i. To institute legal proceedings and disciplinary actions.

ii. To remove and withdraw the perks, privileges, titles, ranks, and designations

entitled to the Petitioner based on his official rank.

by the Commission of Inquiry consisted of the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

As submitted by the Petitioner, he retired from the Sri Lanka Navy in the year 2012 at the age of 53

when he was not offered the Post of Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy since he was the most

senior, most qualified, and the officer with most operational experiences at that time. However, in

the year 2015 he submitted an appeal to a Political Victimization Committee appointed by the then

President and the said Committee decided that the Petitioner had been subjected to Political

Victimization by the previous government and was promoted to the rank of Vice Admiral in

October 2015 backdating to August 2014.

After the change of the Government in the year 2019 His Excellency the President appointed a

Commission of Inquiry presided by the 1st Respondent to look into the allegations of Political

Victimization during the previous regime, but the Petitioner was neither informed of a complaint

received against him by the said Commission of Inquiry nor was given any communication of

transpiring his name during an inquiry proceeded before the said Commission.

As revealed before this Court, the Commission of Inquiry appointed by His Excellency had

submitted its final report to His Excellency the President somewhere around 8th December 2020

70

but the said report did not carry any recommendation against the Petitioner. However as

submitted by the Petitioner before this Court, subsequent to the handing over of the final report of

the Commission of Inquiry, an undated document was circulated as the Addendum to the final

report.

The Petitioner was able to obtain a copy of the said Addendum which is produced marked P-7 (ii)

by him before this Court.

In the said Addendum, reasons for the publication of the Addendum were explained in the

introduction to the Addendum as follows;

wjika jd;dj m.Klh wdOdrfhka uqkh lsfoS wlaIr fodaI is we;s njg fmkS

;SrKh lr we;

From the above explanation provided by the Commission of Inquiry it is clear that the undated

Addendum was not available at the time the final report was prepared and it is a subsequent

publication by the Commission of Inquiry. It is also observed that the reason for the publication of

the Addendum was to rectify printing mistakes and omissions.

However as found in the addendum the Commission of Inquiry has recommended to remove four

names from the Respondents list in the complaint Nos. 01-05 made by Admiral of the Fleet

Wasantha J. Karannagoda and re-arrange the list of 7 Respondents and thereafter add five more

persons as Respondents Nos. 8-12 which including the Petitioners in SC FR 57/2021 and SC FR

125/2021 namely. Retired Vice Admiral S.M.B. Weerasekera and Retired Admiral T.J.L Sinnaih

respectively.

It was also recommended in the Addendum, to include as the 6th recommendation in the main

recommendation, several findings against the 5 persons added by the Addendum including the

following recommendation against the Petitioner,

as submitted by the Petitioner when making the said recommendation to institute legal and

disciplinary actions against the Petitioner and to remove and withdraw the perks, privileges, titles,

rank, and designation entitled to the Petitioner, the Commission of Inquiry had neither notified the

Petitioner of the allegations against him nor afforded an opportunity to explain his position before

the Commission of Inquiry. On behalf of the Petitioner, it was further submitted that the Petitioner

being a Retired Military Officer is duty bound to assist in any investigation, had made a statement

to the Criminal Investigation Department with regard to the investigation into the disappearance of

some youths but had, denied creating contradictions causing damage to carry out justice.

FRA/58/2021

The Petitioner, Ekanayake Mudiyanselage Somisara Bandara Ekanayake is a Retired Officer of the

Sri Lanka Administrative Service. He was working as the Secretary to the Prime Minister, at the time

he resigned from his post with effect from 21st November 2019.

The Petitioner states that on 23rd January 2021, Dinamina, Sinhala daily newspaper published by

the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Co Ltd carried a news item with the photograph of the

Petitioner with the headline titled w.ue;s ldhd,h flda 3lg jefhka IK uokhg ho

lr,d ysgmq f,al iukag tfrysj kS;s mshjr .kak"

As pointed out by the Petitioner, the said news item alleged that the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry which was appointed by His Excellency the President to inquire into alleged incidents of

Political Victimization, upon an inquiry on a complainant lodged by Wijedasa Rajapaksha MP on the

abuse of public property by the Anti-Corruption Committee and the Anti-Corruption Secretariat,

recommended that action to be taken against the Petitioner for committing criminal breach of trust

by authorizing to spend more than 33.7 million for the expenses of the office of Anti-Corruption

Secretariat from the vote of the Office of the Prime Minister.

72

It was further stated in the said news item that,

The Petitioner further states that on 24th January 2021, the Sunday Times newspaper carried a

news item titled Call for a special presidential com: Col on political victimization.

The said news item carried the purported findings of the said Commission of Inquiry implicating

several individuals including the Petitioner,

a) For violation of the Constitution

b) For committing the Breach of trust

c) For committing offenses under the Public Property Act

The Petitioner had made several attempts to obtain an official copy of the said final report of the

Commission of Inquiry, but he was informed that no such report has yet been published for the

consumption of the general public. Petitioner contends that despite him being denied of an official

version of the said final report, a document purporting to be the final report of the said

Commission of Inquiry was in public circulation.

With regard to the allegation of spending 33.7 million for the Anti-Corruption Committee

Secretariat, the Petitioner states that His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena who was elected

73

with the mandate to fight against corruption had submitted a Cabinet Memorandum bearing no

15/0005/602/002 dated 21/01/2015 titled 'Appointment of unit to investigate corruption'. And the

Cabinet of Ministers had decided to establish an Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the

large-scale fraudulent activities.

The Petitioner was directed to take action by the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers by letter

dated 07th March 2015 bearing No 5/0168/602/002-II as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers for

the recruitment of staff and payments to be made to them which was implemented by the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner whilst categorically denying the allegations against him relating to misappropriation

of funds, contends that he has acted within the legally sanctioned framework and had followed the

established procedure.

The Petitioner further states that he was neither summoned as a Witness nor a Respondent by the

said Presidential Commission of Inquiry either to record statements or to give evidence and he was

never even given an opportunity to defend himself or to present his version of the role he played in

the establishment and functioning of the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat, which the

Petitioner was accused of misusing public property.

Hence the Petitioner submits that the said inquiry conducted by the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry to inquire into alleged incidents of Political Victimization has offended rules of natural

justice by depriving due process rights of the petitioner in conducting the said inquiry and

submitting the purported report.

FRA/74/2021

The Petitioner, Dukganna Walawwe Ravindra Bandara Senevirathne was serving as the head of the

Criminal Investigation Department at the time he retired in 2019. The Petitioner states that two

complaints bearing No PCI/PV/01/COM/1-2020 & 5- 2020 PCI/PV/01 COM. 2/2020 have been

lodged by 32nd and 33rd Respondents who were serving as the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy

and the Navy Spokes Person during the period of civil war respectively stating that they were

subjected to Political Victimization during the period commencing 8th January 2015 and ending 16th

November 2019 before Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire into alleged incidents of

74

Political Victimization of public officers, employees of state corporations, members of armed forces

and police service against the Petitioner which resulted in an inquiry to be initiated by the said

Commission of Inquiry against the Petitioner. However, until the Petitioner received a notice

directing him to appear before the Commission with regard to a complaint said to have made by

the 33rd Respondents, he was unaware of such complaint. As learnt by him the complaints made by

the said Respondents connect to the investigations and legal proceedings carried out by the

Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney Generals Department in respect of the alleged

incident of the disappearance of 11 young men during the period of Civil War in 2008 and 2009.

The Petitioner states that he had assumed duties as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police

in Charge of the Criminal Investigation Department in 2012 when the investigations against the said

Respondents had already commenced. The Petitioner further alleges that the 32nd and 33rd

Respondents were also named as suspects in the Magistrate Court of Colombo case No B/732/09

and as accused in the High Court of Colombo Special Trial at Bar case No HC (TAB) 1448/2020.

The Petitioner states that under item no 9.1 in volume 1 of the final report, the Petitioner has been

named as the 10th Respondent in the complaint made by the 32nd Respondent, bearing complaint

no PCI/PV/01/COM./1-2020&5-2020. As per the complaint, allegations that had been considered in

the purported report was that the issuance of an order by the Petitioner to Inspector of Police Mr.

Nishantha Silva of the Criminal Investigation Department to record a statement from the 32nd

Respondent.

However, the Petitioner denying the accusations against him, maintains the position that the said

order was made by him within the parameters of the law, as well as in accordance with the

departmental orders and as a part of his duty.

The Petitioner further states that it was recorded at page 69-70 of the purported report as follows;

The Petitioner contends that although the Commission of Inquiry made the aforesaid

recommendations upon adverse findings against the Petitioner after an inquiry, he was neither

served with the summons to appear before the said Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire

into alleged incidents of Political Victimization with regard to the complaint made by the 32nd

Respondent nor he had been served with the purported complaint or the purported allegation.

76

The Petitioner further states that under item no 9.1 in volume 1 of the final report, the Petitioner

has been named as the 10th Respondent in the complaint made by the 33rd Respondent, bearing

complaint no PCI/PV/01/COM./2-2020.

The Petitioner states that although he had received the summons and notice informing him to

appear before the commission with regard to the said complaint lodged by 33rd Respondent, the

Petitioner was not served with him the purported complaint or the purported allegations against

him.

The Petitioner states that on 19th August 2020, he appeared before the Commission of Inquiry

through an Attorney at Law but during the said inquiry he was only questioned about a meeting to

which the Petitioner participated in his official capacity as the head of the CID upon an invitation by

then Secretary to Ministry of Law and Order, Public Administration and Disaster Management Mr.

Padmasiri Jayamanna to discuss complications and impediments faced by CID officers in relation to

77

the investigation of the disappearance of 11 young men during the civil war but not a single

question was directed to him with regard to any Political Victimization of 33rd Respondent.

The Petitioner further alleges that he was summoned to the Commission only after the conclusion

of the evidence of the 33rd Respondent and therefore he was not aware of the evidence placed

against him by the 33rd Respondent.

On these grounds petitioner contends that the 1st-3rd Respondents have acted in a prejudicial

manner towards him in conducting the inquiry and making the Petitioner a Respondent in a pre-

determined manner in the said proceedings.

Hence Petitioner submits that the investigations carried out by the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry are in violation of principles of natural justice.

FRA/80/2021

The Petitioner, Kurukulasooriya Mudiyanselage Ananda Wijepala states that after the Presidential

Election - 2019 the Prime Minister had submitted several cabinet papers to give effect to the

undertakings given during the election to fight against corruption. The Cabinet of Ministers after

considering two Cabinet Memorandums Nos 15/0005/602/002 dated 21.01.2015 and

15.003/615/002 dated 21.01.2015 the Cabinet of Ministers had decided,

i. To establish an Anti-Corruption Committee to investigate the large scale corrupt

and fraudulent activities

ii. To appoint sub- committees and a Rapid Response Committee and

iii. To grant approval in order to assign responsibilities to the respective persons

therein.

It was further decided by the Cabinet of Ministers to give effect to the Cabinet Memorandum No

15/0066/602/002-1 and establish the Financial Crimes Investigation Unit under the direct

supervision of the Inspector General of Police and to establish a Secretariat for the Anti-Corruption

Committee established by the previous cabinet decision.

The Petitioner had received a letter of appointment dated 13.02.2015 referring to the cabinet

decision no CP 15/0066/602/002 I appointing him as the director of the Secretariat of the Anti-

78

Corruption Committee as a temporary attachment. This letter was directed to the petitioner by the

office of the Prime Minister.

With the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry to inquire and obtain information pertaining to

the alleged incidents of Political Victimization by His Excellency the President Gotabaya Rajapaksha,

Petitioner received the summons to submit evidence before the said Presidential Commission of

Inquiry on several complaints and the particulars of complaints are as follows;

Complainant No. Name of Complainant Date

1 PCI/PV/01/Com./205/2020 Dr. Nihal Jayathilake 09.09.2020

2 PCI/ PV/Com./88/2020 D.S. Jayaweera 11.06.2020

5 PCI/PV/01/Com./319/2020 W. Wimalasena 05.10.2020

6 PCI/PV/01/Com./432/2020 Dr. Nalakaa Harshajeewa Godahewa 06.10.2020

7 PCI/PV/01/Com./316/2020 R.G.Bandula Thilakasiri 13.10.2020

8 PCI/PV/01/Com./1941/2020 Athuluwage Chaminda Pushpakumara 20.10.2020

9 PCI/PV/01/Com./352/2020 Neel Bandara Hapuhinna 24.09.2020

According to the Petitioner he appeared before the said Presidential Commission of Inquiry with

the summons received under complaint No PCI/PV/01/Com./205/2020, defended by an Attorney at

Law, and gave evidence. The Petitioner contends that the nature in which the quarries were put

forward by the chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry was interruptive, disturbing,

and traumatizing throughout the course of the proceedings.

He further submitted that the nature of the proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry was prima

facie prejudicial and in his opinion the said investigations have been conducted on a pre-

determined and bias perception, but the Petitioner was not given an opportunity to listen to the

complaints made against him by the complainants. The Petitioner contends that it is only through

media reports that he became aware of the fact that the said Commission had completed the

mandated inquiry and handed over their report to His Excellency the President on 18.01.2021.

79

The Petitioner states that he had made several attempts to obtain an official copy of the said final

report but was informed that no such report has yet been published for consumption of the

general public. The Petitioner states that although the Petitioner had been unable to receive an

official version of the final report, a document purporting to be the final report of the said

commission of inquiry was in public circulation at the time of filing the instant application.

However, the Petitioner contends that a soft copy of the final Report was later made available to

him.

The Petitioner states that on perusal of the said final report, the Petitioner came to be aware that

apart from the 9 inquiries to which the Petitioner was summoned, the name of the Petitioner was

included in the findings and recommendations of several other inquiries conducted by the

commission of inquiry without Petitioner being notified or heard.

As further submitted by the Petitioner that the said Commission of Inquiry has purportedly named

the Petitioner as having violated the Constitution along with Mangala Samaraweera, Patali

Champika Ranawaka, Rauff Hakeem, Sarath Fonseka, R. Sampanthan, M.A. Sumanthiran, Anura

Kumara Dissanayake, J.C. Weliamuna, Malik Samarawickrama, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, and

that the said Commission of Inquiry has purportedly found that in addition to violations of the

Constitution, the above mentioned individuals including the Petitioner had also misused public

property through the Anti- Corruption Committee and the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat.

The Petitioner contends that he has not been given any opportunity to be present before the

Commission of Inquiry in trying several complaints against him for which he was not even notified,

and therefore has not been able to know the complaints against him, upon which the said

Commission of Inquiry subsequently determined the Petitioner to be guilty and made such

recommendations against the Petitioner.

Hence the Petitioner submits that by the conduct and the actions of the 1st- 3rd Respondents who

were members of the said Commission of Inquiry, the Petitioner has been denied of

a. notice of allegations against the Petitioner

b. A fair hearing

c. A fair and reasonable opportunity to present his defense

80

d. A hearing before an impartial tribunal and

e. A reasonable consideration of the defense of the Petitioner

Which are central for upholding basic principles of natural justice.

FRA 115/2021

The Petitioner of the instant application, Upul Jayasuriya PC former President of the Bar

Association of Sri Lanka had alleged the violation of his fundamental rights by the Presidential

Commission of Inquiry comprising of the 1st to 3rd Respondents making vexatious allegation and

recommendation against the Petitioner.

The basis for the inquiry initiated by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry against the Petitioner

was two complaints received by the said Commission; one was made by Nissanka Senadhipathy

who was indicted before the Trial-at-Bar in case number TAB/751/2019 and the other was made by

Jaliya Wickramasuriya who was produced before Fort Magistrates Court and remanded based on B-

reports submitted by officers of Financial Crimes Investigations Unit.

The Complainant Nissanka Senadhipathy has based his complaint on a press interview given by

former Solicitor General Mr. Suhada Gamlath PC where he had stated that Petitioner at the time

when he was the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka had come to see him every day to his

office to inquire about the case against suspects in the Avant Guard case. However, denying these

allegations, the Petitioner contends that these discussions were ordinary as they were friends and

there was no pressure brought on former Solicitor General Mr. Suhada Gamlath PC by the

Petitioner.

When looking at the complaint made by Jaliya Wickramasuriya on the ground that the Petitioner

had given false or fabricated evidence, the Petitioner states that he is unable to recollect that he

has made any complaint with this inquiry or initiated any prosecution or made any complaint or

send any letter to FCID in connection with the said complainant. The Petitioner further asserts that

it is not an offense to initiate any investigation into a matter of public concern particularly a matter

of this serious nature where the allegations were relating to defrauding of US $ 325,000 by a

person representing the country as a diplomat in the United States. The Petitioner further points

81

out that the complainant Jaliya Wickramasuriya had previously pleaded guilty to the charges levied

against him in the Court of United States of America on the same allegation refuting the allegation

of fabrication of evidence.

The Petitioner contends that he became aware of an inquiry by the said Commission through

newspapers and subsequently he became aware that summons had been sent through the Bar

Association of Sri Lanka. The Petitioner further submits that he had only received the summons

with regard to the complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathy but not with regard to the purported

complaint made by Jaliya Wickramasuriya. Therefore, Petitioner contends that he was unaware of

the said complaint made by Jaliya Wickramasuriya.

The Petitioner states that he attended the said inquiry on 23.06.2020 and raised preliminary

objections to the jurisdiction and the locus standi of the complainants. Nonetheless the 1st-3rd

Respondent proceeded to hear the matter on the ground that an order has already been issued on

that matter though such an order has not been made available to the Petitioner.

Despite the objections raised by the Petitioner the commission proceeded to recommend inter alia

that,

I. the Petitioner should be punished in accordance with Section 189 read with Section 191

of the Penal Code

II. the Petitioner had committed the offense of abetting as per Section 100 of the Penal

Code

III. the Petitioner had committed the offense under Section 70 of the Bribery Act

IV. Action should be instituted against the Petitioner under Section 335 of the Penal Code

The Petitioner alleges that though he has made an endeavor to obtain a copy of the impugned

report by writing to the three Commissioners under registered cover seeking a copy of the report,

but he has not received any response.

For the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner submits that the entire procedure adopted by the said

Commission of Inquiry and the purported recommendations made are grossly indefensible,

unreasonable capricious, and violates principles of legitimate expectation and natural justice.

FRA 125/2021

The Petitioner, Travis Jeremy Liyanduru Sinnaiah was the 21st Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy

and retired from his tenure on 27th October 2017. The Petitioner states that the Commission of

Inquiry to inquire and obtain information pertaining to the alleged incidents of Political

Victimization appointed by His Excellency the President Gotabaya Rajapaksha, which compiled a

final report dated 24th November 2020 did not contain any decision or recommendation to be

implemented against the Petitioner.

The Petitioner contends that subsequent to the Commission of Inquiry compiling the impugned

final report, the Commission further compiled an undated Addendum with the intention of

rectifying certain clerical and typographical errors in the final report which contained a brand new

recommendations to be implemented against the Petitioner together with several other Petitioners

which was also discussed in detail under SC/FR/57/2021.

The basis for the recommendations made against the Petitioner was the complaint made by the 5th

Respondent to the said Commission of Inquiry that the Petitioner had given fabricated evidence

against the 5th Respondent and as a result CID has falsely instituted criminal proceedings against

him at the Magistrate Court of Colombo under the B report bearing No B 732/09 as well as the

Hon. Attorney General has indicted him at the Special Trial at Bar held in Colombo under case No

HC/1448/2020.

The Petitioner states that the 5th Respondent has made the said complaint to the said Commission

of Inquiry in relation to the allegation against him (5th Respondent) in respect of an unlawful

abduction of 11 individuals, illegally detaining them at Trincomalee Navy Base, demanding ransom

for their release and subsequently murdering the said individuals.

Denying these allegations, Petitioner states that CID questioned the Petitioner about the

disappearance of 11 individuals, and Petitioner merely assisted CID by providing them with the

information he possessed which he was duty bound to do.

Thus Petitioner submits that despite the impugned Addendum naming Petitioner as Respondent in

the complaint made by the 5th Respondent, the Petitioner has not been served with summons to

appear before said Commission of Inquiry and thereby denying the Petitioner a fair hearing, a

83

hearing before fair and impartial tribunal as well as fair and reasonable opportunity to present a

defense.

FRA 126/2021

According to the Petitioner, Kamalgoda Mudalige Sandya Priyangani Eknaligoda, complaints made

by 32nd to 43rd Respondents arose from their involvement as accused in cases no B 7417/2010

Magistrate Court of Homagama, HC (TAB) 725/2019 High Court of Colombo and HC 209/2019 at

the High Court of Homagama.

The Petitioner states that her husband who was a well-known journalist was abducted and

murdered two days before the presidential election in 2010. The Petitioner states that she made a

complaint to the Human Rights Commission and further filed a habeas corpus application before

the Court of Appeal which was referred to the Magistrate Court of Homagama to hold an inquiry.

Accordingly, a case was instituted bearing No AR 3170/2011 in the Magistrate Court of Homagama.

It was the position of the Petitioner that, the investigation into the abduction and the death of her

husband continued during the period from 2010- 2015 but there wasnt any progress regarding the

complaints and investigations, and the investigators have failed to arrest and/ or produced any

perpetrators for the abduction. The Petitioner states that due to the above reasons, in 2015 the

CID was directed to re-investigate the abduction and/or kidnapping of Prageeth Eknaligoda. The

Petitioner states that from the investigation it transpired that the 32nd and 40th Respondents as the

perpetrators for the abduction and kidnapping of Prageeth Eknaligoda, thereby accordingly they

were named accused and produced to Magistrate Court of Homagama under the case bearing No

B7417/2010.

The Petitioner states that, subsequent to the inquiry held at Magistrate Court of Homagama, the

44th Respondent decided to indict the 32nd to 40th Respondents, before a Trial at Bar in the case

bearing no HC(TAB)725/2019 for the abduction and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda.

Whilst the aforesaid actions against 32nd to 43rd Respondents were pending before Trial at Bar and

High Court of Homagama, the 32nd to 43rd Respondents has made complaints to the Commission

bearing Nos PCI/PV/01/Com.24/2020, 200/2020, 198/2020, 196/2020, 194/2020, 197/2020,

199/2020, 195/2020, 104/2020, 239/2020, 31/2020 and 231/2020 respectively.

84

The Petitioner, alleges that complaints have been made by 32nd and 43rd Respondents to the

Commission of Inquiry stating that,

i. The CID has wrongfully accused the said Respondent regarding the abduction and/ or

kidnapping and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda

ii. The CID has fabricated false evidence against the Respondent and as a result, the CID

has falsely instituted criminal proceedings against them

iii. The CID has wrongfully intimidated and forced the witnesses to give false evidence

against the Respondents, implicating them for the offense of abduction and/or

kidnapping and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda

iv. They were named as accused wrongfully in the case bearing B 7417/2010 and thereby

the Hon. Attorney General has wrongfully indicted the 32nd and 43rd Respondents.

The Petitioner further states that it was revealed to the Petitioner that the Commission of Inquiry

comprising 1st-3rd Respondents has commenced inquiries pertaining to the aforesaid investigation

based on the complaints made by the 32nd to 43rd Respondents. However, Petitioner states that

she being the aggrieved party to the said complaints, she never received the summons or was

never notified officially regarding the said inquiries.

The Petitioner states that after conducting inquiries, the said Commission of Inquiry compiled a

final report dated 24th November 2020 comprising the decisions of 1st -3rd Respondents, whereby

the impugned final report does not contain decisions and recommendations to be implemented

against the petitioner with regard to the complaints made by 32nd to the 43rd Respondents.

However, after the Commission of Inquiry compiling the impugned final report, the Commission

further compiled an undated Addendum which contained brand new recommendations to be

implemented.

The Petitioner further states that upon perusing the impugned final report it was made aware that

the 1st to 3rd Respondents had inter alia decided following after conducting inquiries for the

complaints made by the 32nd to 43rd Respondents;

I. The Respondents named in the complaint had fabricated and made false evidence

against the complainants (32nd -43rd Respondents) to implicate and frame them for the

abduction and/or kidnapping and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda.

85

II. The complaints (32nd -43rd Respondents) should be acquitted and discharged from all

the charges levied against them in the Homagama Magistrate Court case bearing no B

7417/2010

III. The indictment served on 1st-9th Complainants (32nd -43rd Respondents) in the Trial at

Bar case bearing No HC(TAB) 725/2019, should be withdrawn by the Attorney General,

and the accused persons should be acquitted and discharge from all the counts against

them

IV. The indictment served on the 32nd to 40th Respondent in the Homagama High Court case

bearing No HC 209/2019, should be withdrawn by the Attorney General and thereby

should acquit and discharge them from all the counts against them.

The Petitioner further contends that she has been unable to obtain an official version of the

impugned final report and the impugned Addendum, however a document purported to be the

impugned final report and the impugned Addendum of the Commission of Inquiry was in public

circulation.

The Petitioner submits that in the backdrop of transparent and prolonged inquiries which re-

affirmed the procedural fairness in the institution of criminal proceedings against 32nd to 43rd

Respondents, and therefore, the Petitioner contends that the subsequent recommendations of the

1st -3rd Respondents made after conducting inquiries pertaining to complaints lodged by 32nd to

43rd Respondents are arrived solely relying on the false and unreliable facts presented by the 32nd

to 43rd Respondents before the Commission of Inquiry without looking into the evidence and other

investigations which are vital to the case.

For the foregoing reasons the Petitioner submits that by the actions of the Commission of Inquiry

consisting of the 1st 3rd Respondents, the Petitioner has been inter alia denied of;

i. Reasonable and adequate notice

ii. Fair hearing

iii. A fair and reasonable opportunity to present herself

iv. A hearing before an impartial tribunal

v. A reasonable consideration of the evidence of the Petitioner

86

FRA 132/2021

The Petitioner Gnanendra Shani Abeysekera states that he had held the rank of Senior

Superintendent of Police, and prior to his transfer in November 2019, as the Personal Assistant to

the DIG of Police, Galle Range had held, the post of Director of the Criminal Investigations

Department (CID).

The Petitioner had further submitted that, on 31st July 2020 the Petitioner was arrested and on the

18th of July 2021 he was granted bail. According to the Petitioner, he was summoned by the

Commission of Inquiry through the prison authority, and he has been produced before the

proceedings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.

It was the position taken up by the Petitioner before this Court that the final report which was

compiled based on the purported inquiries said to have hold relating to the complaints made by

32nd to 72nd Respondents stating that they were subjected to Political Victimization during the

period commencing 8th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2019 which consequently resulted

in allegedly naming the Petitioner as the Respondent in respect of the said complaints.

According to the findings and recommendations under item 8 in the said final report the 1st -3rd

Respondent have decided the following;

That the Petitioner has violated oath or affirmation made by public officers more fully

described in the 4th Schedule of the Constitution read with Article 125 of the Constitution;

That the Petitioner has committed the offence of corruption describe in Section 70 of the

Bribery Act as amended;

That the Petitioner earned a salary from public funds by performing in a non-governmental

organization which is an offence under sec 5 of the offences against Public property Act

read with Section 386 of the Penal Code;

That using the premises of Temple Trees for the purpose of holding meetings of Anti-

Corruption Committees which is an NGO has committed the offense of Section 70 of the

Bribery Act as amended;

Denying these allegations the Petitioner contends that his role was purely ministerial and/or

administrative in his capacity as the director of CID in which the investigations are purely

conducted by the investigation officers and that the Petitioner has no involvement with the

87

discovery of the investigation materials or handling or managing the evidence revealed in the

investigation process.

The Petitioner was not summoned to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to

inquire into Political Victimization with regard to the complaints made by 32nd, 33rd, 40th, 41st,47th,

57th,63rd, 64th, 65th, 66th, 67th,68th,69th,70th,71st, and 72nd Respondents claiming they were

subjected to Political Victimization during the period commencing from 08th January 2015 and

ending 16th November 2019, and he was summoned only for the following complaints made before

the 1st-3rd Respondents to render evidence as a witness before the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry into political victimization

According to the Petitioner, the complaints of 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 38th and 40th Respondents

connects to the proceedings carried out in 2009 before the Fort Magistrate Court by CID in respect

of an incident of disappearance and killing of 11 young men during the period of civil war in 2008

and 2009. The Petitioner states that he was assigned to the CID on the 1st of April 2009, as the ASP

at CID and that he was assigned with the supervision of the special investigation branch of CID.

Moreover, the Petitioner states that the investigation of the said investigation of disappearance

and killing of 11 young men was assigned to the Petitioner for supervision. The Petitioner further

contends that the investigations were carried out by Inspector of Police Mr. Nishantha Silva and

that the Petitioners duty was merely to supervise the investigation as the said branch was also

under his supervision.

When it comes to the complaint made by the 44th Respondent bearing complaint No

PCI/PV/01/Com./50-2020, the Petitioner filed a writ application before the Court of Appeal bearing

case No. 167/2020 impugning the jurisdiction of the mandate given to the said Commission to

conduct an inquiry and issue summons in respect of the complaint of 44th Respondent.

The Petitioner states that the said case was supported and thereafter an undertaking was given by

the 1st to 3rd Respondents through their counsel that the Petitioner will only be dispensed in his

presence but the Petitioner states that regardless of the said undertaking, the Petitioner became

aware that certain recommendations have been made against him as a Respondent in respect of

the said complaint in the impugned final report.

The Petitioner further states that the investigation relating to the allegation made by 42nd , 43rd and

45th Respondents were also connected to the allegations made by 44th Respondent and were

conducted by Chief Inspector of Police Lasantha Rathnayake and that the Petitioner had no

89

involvement to the said investigation other than supervising the investigation. Denying the findings

of the 1st -3rd Respondent in respect of the Petitioner in the final report in respect of the complaint

made by 47th Respondent, the Petitioner states that in these investigations also he had only played

a supervisory role and that he did not work and/or participated and/or involved to the Anti-

Corruption Committee.

Hence the Petitioner submits that the purported findings and decisions and the recommendations

are adverse and prejudicial to the rights of the Petitioner.

In respect of the complaint made by the 41st Respondent, the Petitioner states that he was

represented by an Attorney at Law at the Commission of Inquiry through whom it was informed

that the Petitioner did not have any direct involvement with the alleged investigation of the

murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya. The Petitioner further contends that the said investigations was

conducted by ASP Mr. Thisera upon an order made by then director of CID, Mr. Nagahamulla. On a

request made by ASP Thisera, the Petitioner has granted approval to engage IP Nishantha Silva in

the said investigation. According to the Petitioner, the arrest of Lalith Jayasinghe was made only

after receiving instruction from the Attorney General who had studied the material forwarded to

him after the completion of the investigation by the CID.

The Petitioner further states that the evidence given by ASP Thisera before the Commission of

Inquiry made it clear that the Petitioner was not involved with the alleged investigation.

The Petitioner states that he was shocked to find his name as a Respondent in respect of the

complaint made by the 39th Respondent in the purported final report as it was recorded in the

proceedings that Petitioner has no involvement in the alleged investigation.

With regard to the abduction and/or kidnapping and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda, the

Petitioner had submitted that he only acted in a supervisory capacity as the director of CID, and all

the complainants were indicted before the High Court of Colombo in HC(TAB) 725/19 for the

abduction and/or kidnapping and the murder of Prageeth Eknaligoda and High Court Homagama

209/19 regarding the abduction of Prageeth Eknaligoda on the 27th April 2009.

The Petitioner states that investigation of the incident of kidnapping and/or assault and/or causing

grievous hurt of journalist Keith Nooyahr was investigated by ASP Thisera and IP Nishantha Silva

and the Petitioner's involvement to the said investigation was limited to the supervision of the said

90

investigation as the Superintendent of Police and thereafter overall supervision of the investigation

in his capacity as the director of CID. The Petitioner states that all the evidence discovered by the

investigation officers was submitted to the Hon. Attorney General and thereafter with the

recommendations of the Hon. Attorney General facts were reported to Mount Lavinia Magistrate

Court in case No 1535/ 08 and that the said case is currently pending before High Court of

Gampaha.

Hence the Petitioner vehemently denies the accusation made against him in the impugned final

report or the impugned undated Addendum, and further states that the allegations of the

complainants were explicitly absurd and bias and that the findings and recommendations of the

Commission were flawed due to the following reasons;

i. the Petitioner was not served with the summons to appear before the Commission

of Inquiry into the list of complaints made before the Commission claiming they

were subjected to political victimization

ii. the Petitioner was not served with the purported complaints made against him by

the Commission

iii. the Petitioner was not aware of the evidence given by the complainants before the

Commission and whether the complaints have established a prima facie case with

credible evidence in support of any of the allegations before the Commission

iv. the Petitioner was not heard by the Commission before making any

recommendation

The two main questions to be adjudicated in all fundamental rights petitions presented before us

are whether the principles of natural justice have been violated in the purported investigation/

inquiry carried out by 1st-3rd Respondents and the impugned final report produced, which contains

adverse findings and recommendations against the Petitioners to the Petitions in question and if

so, whether the said violation of the principles of natural justice amounts to the violation of

fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.

Unlike the constricted approach adopted towards principles of natural justice during the period of

World War 2, presently principles of natural justice have a wider application where it is recognized

that adherence to natural justice is important in bodies exercising judicial, quasi-judicial, and

administrative powers. There are two main principles of natural justice which every public

91

authority should follow whether or not these are specifically provided in the relevant Acts or rules.

They are right to be heard and rule against bias.

The principles of natural Justice are expressly built into and firmly entrenched under Section 16 as

well as proviso to Section 23 of the Commission of Inquiry Act No 17 of 1948.

The proviso to Section 23 stipulates that,

Provided however, the commission shall not arrive at any conclusion on such matter or

incident investigated into, unless the commission has examined the material collected in the

course of investigation and inquired into such matter or incident, observing the rules of

natural justice.

Hence in making a decision as to the procedure of an inquiry, or in making a finding that is adverse

to any person by a Commission of Inquiry established under the said Act, the inquiry must comply

with the principles of natural justice. The principle of natural justice ensures that people subject to

investigation have a proper opportunity to respond to ensure that the Inquirys reports are fair and

accurate. If a proposed finding may adversely affect the interests of any person, the Inquiry must

be satisfied that the person is aware of the matters on which the proposed finding is based and has

had an opportunity, at any time during the course of the Inquiry, to respond on those matters.

In SC/FR/Application No 27/2021, the Petitioner Padmini Nirmala Ranawaka specifically alleges that

she was not summoned or noticed to appear before the said Commission of Inquiry or that she was

afforded any form of hearing by the said Commission. Though the 1st Respondent claims that

necessary inquiries were held by the said Commission of Inquiry in respect of all parties

summoned, the 1st Respondent had failed to demonstrate summons were served on her and she

was afforded a hearing.

One of the most important rules of natural justice is the right to be heard which is referred to by

the Latin term audi alterem partem. It means that each party must be given adequate notice of the

case and thereby afforded a fair opportunity of stating his own case and of correcting or

contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to him.19

19 JAL Cooray, Constitutional and Administrative law of Sri Lanka (1st edn, Hansa Publishers, 1973) at 330.

92

In the celebrated case of Cooper vs Wandsworth Board of Works20 the Court emphasized the

importance of audi alteram partem rule as follows;

Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam before he was called upon to make his

defence. Adam says God, where art thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I

commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat.

In Abeyrathne vs Jayantha Fertilizer Enterprise Ltd21 it was held that

Natural justice is now built into our law and provides fair administration procedure.

It encompasses the right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal, right to have notice of charges

of misconduct and the right to be heard in answer to those charges. The audi alteram

partem rule means that a man has a right to be heard. This rule is so fundamental and vital

in regard to the manner in which justice has to be administered. It constitutes one of the

basic principles of fair procedure.

Therefore each party must have reasonable notice of the case he has to meet and he must

be given an opportunity of putting forward his case. In other words, a person should not be

condemned without being first given a fair chance of exculpation.

In B. Sirisena Cooray vs Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and two Others22 it was held that

the determinations and recommendations of the commission are flawed firstly as being

unreasonable in that commissioner did not call attention to the relevant matter, secondly as

they are not based on evidence of any probative value and thirdly because

recommendations have been reached without giving the petitioner a right to hearing in

breach of principles of natural justice

Here it could be said that the failure to furnish the purported complaint made by 38th Respondent

against the Petitioner constitutes a clear breach of principles of natural justice, particularly audi

alteram Parteram rule, in that without knowing the complaint made against a person, such person

is unable to duly or properly defend himself/herself and/or to respond to the same.

93

In SC/FR/Application No 57/2021, the Petitioner, Retired Vice Admiral Susith Maliya Bandara

Weerasekara contends that he has never been summoned before the Commission of Inquiry nor

made any communication asking the Petitioner to be presented at the said Commission in order to

present his version to any claims raised against him. Similarly in SC/FR/Application No 58/2021 the

Petitioner, Somisara Ekanayake submits that he had neither been summoned nor made aware that

there have been complaints made against the Petitioner to the said Commission and the Petitioner

had come to the knowledge of such findings and/or recommendations against him only upon some

news articles that were published. In SC/FR/Application No 80/2021 the Petitioner, Ananda

Wijepala also states that he was not given an opportunity to present before the Commission when

considering several complaints against him and he was neither given notice of such complaints nor

their nature which then had led the Commission of Inquiry to determine that Petitioner is guilty of

offenses as alleged to have committed as found in the impugned final report. The Petitioner

therefore submits that Commission of lnquiry therein had denied him of notices of allegation, a fair

and transparent hearing, fair, and reasonable opportunity to present his defense, and a reasonable

consideration of the defense.

In SC/FR/Application No 125/2021, the Petitioner Travis Sinniah also seeks to set aside the findings

of the impugned report for breach of principles of natural justice on the basis that he was never

been summoned before the said Commission of Inquiry nor made any communication whatsoever

asking the Petitioner to be present at the said Inquiry. When it comes to SC/FR/Application No

126/2021, the Petitioner Sandya Eknaligoda, claims that despite Section 11 of the Commission of

Inquiry Act has required the Commission to issue summons to relevant parties to an inquiry, the

Petitioner neither received summons nor was notified officially regarding the complaints made

against her. She further contends that she was not given an opportunity to be present before the

said Commission of Inquiry despite the Petitioner being the prosecution witness No 1 in both the

cases HC (TAB) 725/2019 and HC 209/2019 which were relating to the abduction and/ or

kidnapping and the murder of Petitioners husband Prageeth Eknaligoda that subsequently led the

Commission of Inquiry to determine and make recommendations against the interests of the

Petitioner.

94

The right to notice is an essential component of audi alteram partem rule. This was discussed in

detail by Gunawardene J. in Gunadasa vs Attorney General and Others23 citing Lord Denning in the

case of Kanda vs Government of Malaya24 and stated that

If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a

right in the accused man to know the case which is to be made against him. He must know

what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him and then

he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them.

In the case of Ganeshanatham vs Vivien Goonewardene25 it was held that

The right to be heard and defend oneself will be illusionary and meaningless without

knowledge of the case to be met, of the charge or the subject matter of dispute to be

decided by the court or tribunal, and also without an adequate opportunity of placing that

which has to be put forward in defense either in person or through counsel of Ones own

choice.

In the case of Gregory Fernando and Others vs Stanley Perera,26 Sripavan J. observed that,

It is fundamental importance that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and

undoubtedly be seen to be done. The law is concerned with public confidence in the

administration of justice, hence it is of paramount importance to ensure that individuals that

they have been given a fair hearing before a decision is taken.

In the case of Mendis, Fowzie and Others vs Goonewardene, 27 which deals with Commissions of

Inquiry appointed by the President by warrant under the Commissions of Inquiry Act to inquire into

and report the twelve municipalities specified in the schedule to the warrant, there had been

incompetence, mismanagement, abuse of power, corruption, irregularities in the making of

appointments of persons, or contraventions of any provisions of any written law and the extent of

their responsibility, it was noted that,

23 [1989] 2 SLR 130 at 133-134 24 [1962] AC 322 25 (1984) 1 Sri LR 319 (at page 363) 26 [2004] 1 Sri LR 346 at 349 27 (1978-79) 2 Sri L. R

95

In making their Report in this case the Commissioners had to come to findings and make

determinations and any adverse decision would undoubtedly affect the character of the

persons concerned and their reputation and integrity and ruin their careers in addition to

making them suffer civic disabilities under the two laws. The determinations of the two

Commissioners would grievously affect these persons of their own force, proprio vigor. The

conclusions would therefore have to be arrived at by a process consistent with the rules of

natural justice after informing the party of the case against him and affording him an

opportunity to defend himself.

In University of Ceylon vs Fernando28 the Privy Council held that the Plaintiff should be adequately

informed of the case he has to meet, and should be given an adequate opportunity to meet it.

In Nanayakkara vs University of Peradeniya29 where the university suspended the Petitioner after

the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry which found the Petitioner guilty of participating in acts

which caused damages to university property, the Court of Appeal found that the Petitioner

appeared before the Committee of Inquiry unexpectedly and without any prior notice. When he

appeared before the Committee he appeared as an accused or Respondent party and not as a

witness since there were already allegations made against him. Therefore, the Court held that the

Committee was bound to inform him of the allegations and give him every opportunity to make his

defense.

The petitioner having been taken before the Committee of Inquiry on 7.3.1983 without prior

notice and given time till 2.00 p.m. that day for his defence, it Cannot be said that he had

been given a fair hearing as he had not been informed of the allegations against him and

their nature prior to his appearance before the Committee nor given a fair opportunity of

making his defence properly.

Moreover, notice which is given of one charge is not sufficient for proceeding under another

charge even though both charges arise out of the same circumstances.30 In Annamunthodo vs

Oilfield Workers Trade Union31 it was held that expulsion of the applicant under a rule of the

union which was invoked without giving him notice of it was void despite the fact that he had

attended a hearing earlier in respect of a charge of breaking four other rules.

In SC/FR/Application No 115/2021, the Petitioner Upul Jaysuriya contends that he had only

received summons with regard to the complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathy but did not

receive any summons pertaining to the purported complaint made by Jaliya Wickramasuriya based

on which the Commission of Inquiry had made adverse recommendations against him. The

Petitioner has further submitted that even in the case he was summoned to appear before the

Commission of linquiry, he was not given a proper hearing by the Commissioners. Hence the

Petitioner seeks to set aside the said findings on the ground of breach of principles of natural

justice.

In SC/FR/Application No 132/2021 the Petitioner, Gnanendra Shani Abeysekara states that he had

only been summoned to some of the complaints made against him and not for the other. According

to the Petitioner, he had not given evidence before the Commission for which he was summoned

to appear as he was of the opinion that giving evidence at CoI would interfere with the several

cases pending before the High Court as well before the Magistrate Courts.

In SC/FR/Application No 74/2021 the Petitioner, Ravindra Bandara Senevirathne challenging the

adverse findings made in the impugned report against him based on 2 complaints made by Admiral

of Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda and D.S.P. Dassanayake contends that he was neither served with

summons to appear before the Commission nor the purported complaint made by Admiral of Fleet

Wasantha Karathnagoda against him had been served to the Petitioner. The Petitioner further

states that even though he had received summons and notice from the 4th Respondent under the

order of 1st to 3rd Respondent informing the Petitioner to appear before the Commission with

regard to the complaint made by D.S.P. Dassanayake, neither the purported complaint nor the

purported allegation against the Petitioner had been served to the Petitioner. When it comes to

the proceedings marked as P-10, the Petitioner was summoned to the Commission only after the

conclusion of the evidence of the 33rd Respondent and therefore the Petitioner was not aware of

the evidence placed against him by the 33rd Respondent.

In Amerasinghe vs Daluwatte and Others32 where Petitioner sought to quash the proceedings of

the Army Court of Inquiry, the Court noted that,

The principle that no man should be condemned unheard is one regarded with reverence

and ought not to be lightly disregarded. There is no point in hearing the other side if the

"other side" does not know what the side beginning had said, and unless "the other side" is

afforded a reasonable and genuine opportunity to meet and repel the allegations.

When considering all the said factors it is clear that there are clear violations of different aspects of

rules of natural justice in Inquiries conducted against each Petitioner.

Now I shall turn to the question whether the breach of principles of natural justice referred to

above amounts to violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under the

Constitution. The Respondents contend that the violation of principles of natural justice alone is

not sufficient to constitute a breach of ones fundamental rights citing Justice Sharvananda in the

case of Elmore Perera vs Major Montegue Jayawickrama33 where his Lordship stated that Rules of

natural justice cannot be elevated to the status of fundamental rights. Natural justice is not a

fundamental right in our country where the architects of our constitution deliberately eschewed the

due process found in the American constitution. This was cited with approval in the case of

Roberts vs Ratnayake.34

The first petitioners next complaint is about rudeness, incivility, and the failure to

reply his letters by the Respondent regarding the official matters. But they do not

constitute a violation of any statutory obligation on the part of the respondent and

consequently no legal right, far from a fundamental right is infringed. The first

petitioners application therefore must fail

However, our Courts over the time have departed from this stringent approach and has viewed

violations of principles of natural justice as a violation of equal protection of law which is a

fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. In cases such as Jayawardene vs

Wijethilake,35 Amerasinghe vs Board of Directors, CWE 36 and Hapuarachchi vs Commissioner of

Election37 our Courts have interpreted the breach of principles of natural justice as an infringement

of the right to equal protection of law guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. The

modern view of the Court with regard to Article 12(1) of the Constitution is clearly evident in the

case of R. Samapanthan vs AG38 where it was observed that,

Art 12(1) which perhaps has the most dynamic jurisprudence in our constitutional law, offers

all persons protection against arbitrary and mala-fide exercise of power and guarantees

principles of natural justice and legitimate expectation.

For the foregoing reasons it could be concluded that the proceedings against the Petitioners and

the impugned report produced consequent to such proceedings are unlawful and are in violation of

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

We therefore make order quashing the findings/ recommendation made by the Commission of

Inquiry appointed by His Excellency the then President Gotabaya Rajapakse by warrant published in

the Government Gazette Extraordinary 2157/44 dated 09.01.2020 and Government Gazette

Extraordinary 2159/16 dated 22.01.2020 as against the Petitioners before this Court namely,
