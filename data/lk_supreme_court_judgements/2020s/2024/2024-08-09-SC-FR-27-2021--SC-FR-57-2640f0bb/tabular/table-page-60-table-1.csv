"H
owever, this claim is misconceived and erroneous as Commission of Inquiry is investigative or fact"
"finding in nature and is incapable of making any binding decisions that have any effect on the rights"
"of  the  parties  which  makes  it  starkly  different  from  judicial  tribunal  which  is  capable  of  making"
"decisions that are both binding and enforceable subject to appeal."
"Any finding or recommendation made by the Commission of Inquiry at the conclusion of the inquiry"
"is  wholly  dependent  on 
the  executive  or  administrative  branch  of 
the  government 
for 
its"
"implementation.  Until  the  executive 
implements  any  findings  or  recommendations  made  by  a"
"Commission of Inquiry, such findings or recommendations have no force or avail in law. Therefore,"
"it could be said that powers and functions exercised by the said Commission is neither judicial nor"
"quasi- judicial in nature."
"The Respondents further claim that Powers, functions, authority vested in the said Commission of"
"Inquiry  which  the  1st  to  3rd  Respondents  are  the  chairman  and  members  is  not  an  agency  or"
"instrumentality of the state as per the Commission of Inquiry Act No 17 of 1948 and therefore not"
"amenable to judicial review under Article 126 of the Constitution."
"However it is important to note that the then Executive President appointed 1st -3rd Respondents as"
"the members of the said Commission of Inquiry to investigate matters of Political Victimization that"
"allegedly occurred during the period 08/01/2015- 16/12/2019 by way of a warrant published in the"
"Government (Extra-ordinary) Gazette notification bearing No 2157/44 dated 09/01/2020 by virtue"
"of powers vested in him qua President of the Republic, under the Commission of Inquiry Act No 17"
"of  1948  (as  amended)  read  together  with  Article  33(2)  of  the  Constitution,  under  the  seal  of  the"
"Republic.  The  terms  of  Reference  and/or  mandate  and/or  scope  of  the 
inquiry  of  the  said"
"Commission was determined and stipulated by the Executive President. Accordingly, the source of"
"power of the said Commission of Inquiry and/or its members was clearly the Executive President."
"Since the said Commission of Inquiry was created and/or brought into existence for the purpose of"
"executing the said mandate of the President, the Commission was in fact an instrumentality and/or"
"agent  of  then  President/  government  and  conducted  themselves  as  such  and  consequently  their"
"actions vis a vis the Petitioners, were executive in nature."
"Therefore, the contention that the said Commission of Inquiry is not an instrumentality or agency"
"of the government is untenable."
