"In SC/FR/Application No 132/2021 the Petitioner, Gnanendra Shani Abeysekara states that he had"
"only been summoned to some of the complaints made against him and not for the other. According"

"of Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda and D.S.P. Dassanayake contends that he was neither served with"
"summons to appear before the Commission nor the purported complaint made by Admiral of Fleet"

"states that even though he had received summons and notice from the 4th Respondent under the"
"order  of  1st  to  3rd  Respondent  informing  the  Petitioner  to  appear  before  the  Commission  with"
"regard  to  the  complaint  made  by  D.S.P.  Dassanayake,  neither  the  purported  complaint  nor  the"
"purported  allegation  against  the  Petitioner  had  been  served  to  the  Petitioner.  When  it  comes  to"
"the proceedings marked as P-10, the Petitioner was summoned to the  Commission only after the"
"conclusion of the evidence  of the 33rd Respondent and therefore the Petitioner was not aware of"
"the evidence placed against him by the 33rd Respondent."
