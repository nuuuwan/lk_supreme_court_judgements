"these powers which cannot appropriately classified as legislative, judicial or executive, but"
"are  nevertheless  ‘administrative’ 
in  a  public 
law  sense,  are  also 
included 
in  the  phrase"
"‘executive  and  administrative.’  Thus  the  question  whether an  act  falls  within  the  ambit  of"
"this  expression  cannot  be determined  on  assumption  that  it  includes  all  exertions  of  state"
"powers  or  the  performance  of  governmental  power  of  function;  nor  on  the  basis  that  if"
"particular  institutions,  functionaries  or  officials  are  ‘legislative’  or  ‘judicial’  their  acts  are"
"necessarily excluded. In the scheme of the constitution, as laid out in Articles 3 and 4, one of"
"the powers of the government is the judicial power of the people; the judiciary thus exercises"
"a governmental power of function………………"
"In my view, therefore the test must always be whether the impugned act was ‘executive or"
"administrative’,  not  whether  the  institution  or  person  concerned  can  be  characterized  as"
"‘executive’  (or 
‘governmental’  which 
is  often  used  as 
if 
it  were  equivalent.)  of  course,"
"reference  to  the  executive  character  of  such 
institution  or  person,  and  the  degree  of"
"‘executive’ control may be justifiable, and necessary, in the borderline cases, but ultimately"
"the  decision  must  depend  on  whether  the  act  is  ‘executive  or  administrative’  in  character,"
"and not upon the status of the institution or the official."
