"w
ith  the  mandate  to  fight  against  corruption  had  submitted  a  Cabinet  Memorandum  bearing  no"
"15/0005/602/002 dated 21/01/2015 titled 'Appointment of unit to investigate corruption'. And the"
"Cabinet  of  Ministers  had  decided  to  establish  an  Anti-Corruption  Commission  to  investigate  the"
"large-scale fraudulent activities."
"The  Petitioner  was  directed  to  take  action  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  by  letter"
"dated 07th March 2015 bearing No 5/0168/602/002-II as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers for"
"the  recruitment  of  staff  and  payments  to  be  made  to  them  which  was 
implemented  by  the"
"Petitioner."
"The Petitioner whilst categorically denying the allegations against him relating to misappropriation"
"of funds, contends that he has acted within the legally sanctioned framework and had followed the"
"established procedure."
"The Petitioner further states that he was neither summoned as a Witness nor a Respondent by the"
"said Presidential Commission of Inquiry either to record statements or to give evidence and he was"
"never even given an opportunity to defend himself or to present his version of the role he played in"
"the  establishment  and 
functioning  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Committee  Secretariat,  which  the"
"Petitioner was accused of misusing public property."
"Hence  the  Petitioner  submits  that  the  said  inquiry  conducted  by  the  Presidential  Commission  of"
"Inquiry  to  inquire  into  alleged  incidents  of  Political  Victimization  has  offended  rules  of  natural"
"justice  by  depriving  due  process  rights  of  the  petitioner 
in  conducting  the  said 
inquiry  and"
"submitting the purported report."
