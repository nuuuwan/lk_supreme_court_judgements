"t
he  investigation  of  the  disappearance  of  11  young  men  during  the  civil  war  but  not  a  single"
"question was directed to him with regard to any Political Victimization of 33rd Respondent."
"The Petitioner further alleges that he was summoned to the Commission only after the conclusion"
"of  the  evidence  of  the  33rd  Respondent  and  therefore  he  was  not  aware  of  the  evidence  placed"
"against him by the 33rd Respondent."
"On  these  grounds  petitioner  contends  that  the  1st-3rd  Respondents  have  acted  in  a  prejudicial"
"manner towards  him in  conducting the inquiry and making the  Petitioner a Respondent  in a pre-"
"determined manner in the said proceedings."
"Hence  Petitioner  submits  that  the  investigations  carried  out  by  the  Presidential  Commission  of"
"Inquiry are in violation of principles of natural justice."
