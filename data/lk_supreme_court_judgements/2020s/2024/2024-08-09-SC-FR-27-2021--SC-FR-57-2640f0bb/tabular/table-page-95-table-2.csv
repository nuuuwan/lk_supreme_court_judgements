"natural  justice  after  informing  the  party  of  the  case  against  him  and  affording  him  an"
"opportunity to defend himself."
"In University of Ceylon vs Fernando28  the Privy Council held that the Plaintiff should be adequately"
"informed of the case he has to meet, and should be given an adequate opportunity to meet it."
"In Nanayakkara vs University of Peradeniya29 where the university suspended the Petitioner after"
"the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry which found the Petitioner guilty of participating in acts"
"which  caused  damages  to  university  property,  the  Court  of  Appeal  found  that  the  Petitioner"
"appeared  before  the  Committee  of  Inquiry  unexpectedly  and  without  any  prior  notice.  When  he"
"appeared  before  the  Committee  he  appeared  as  an  accused  or  Respondent  party  and  not  as  a"
"witness since there were already allegations made against him. Therefore, the Court held that the"
"Committee was bound to inform him of the allegations and give him every opportunity to make his"
"defense."
