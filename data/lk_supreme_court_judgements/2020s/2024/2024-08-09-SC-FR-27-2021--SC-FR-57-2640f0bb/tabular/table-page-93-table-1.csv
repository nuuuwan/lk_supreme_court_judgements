n  SC/FR/Application  No  57/2021,  the  Petitioner,  Retired  Vice  Admiral  Susith  Maliya  Bandara"
"Weerasekara contends that he has never been summoned before the  Commission of Inquiry nor"
"made any communication asking the Petitioner to be presented at the said Commission in order to"
"present his version to any claims raised against him. Similarly in SC/FR/Application No 58/2021 the"
"Petitioner, Somisara Ekanayake submits that he had neither been summoned nor made aware that"
"there have been complaints made against the Petitioner to the said Commission and the Petitioner"
"had come to the knowledge of such findings and/or recommendations against him only upon some"
"news  articles  that  were  published. 
 
In  SC/FR/Application  No  80/2021  the  Petitioner,  Ananda"
"Wijepala also states that he was not given an opportunity to present before the Commission when"
"considering several complaints against him and he was neither given notice of such complaints nor"
"their nature which then had led the Commission of Inquiry to determine that Petitioner is guilty of"
"offenses  as  alleged  to  have  committed  as  found 
in  the 
impugned  final  report.  The  Petitioner"
"therefore submits that Commission of lnquiry therein had denied him of notices of allegation, a fair"
"and transparent hearing, fair, and reasonable opportunity to present his defense, and a reasonable"
"consideration of the defense."
"In SC/FR/Application No 125/2021, the Petitioner Travis Sinniah also seeks to set aside the findings"
"of the impugned report for breach of principles  of natural justice on the basis that he was never"
"been summoned before the said Commission of Inquiry nor made any communication whatsoever"
"asking  the  Petitioner  to  be  present  at  the  said  Inquiry.  When  it  comes  to  SC/FR/Application  No"
"126/2021, the Petitioner Sandya Eknaligoda, claims that despite  Section 11 of the Commission of"
"Inquiry Act  has required the Commission to  issue summons to relevant parties to an inquiry, the"
"Petitioner  neither  received  summons  nor  was  notified  officially  regarding  the  complaints  made"
"against her. She further contends that she was not given an opportunity to be present before the"
"said Commission of Inquiry despite the Petitioner being the prosecution witness No 1 in both the"
"cases  HC 
(TAB)  725/2019  and  HC  209/2019  which  were  relating  to  the  abduction  and/  or"
"kidnapping and the murder of Petitionerâ€™s husband Prageeth Eknaligoda that subsequently led the"
"Commission  of  Inquiry  to  determine  and  make  recommendations  against  the 
interests  of  the"
"Petitioner."
