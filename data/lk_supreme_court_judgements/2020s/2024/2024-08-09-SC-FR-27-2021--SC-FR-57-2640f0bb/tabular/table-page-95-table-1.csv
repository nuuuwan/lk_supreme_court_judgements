"95"
"In  making  their  Report  in  this  case  the  Commissioners  had  to  come  to  findings  and  make"
"determinations  and  any  adverse  decision  would  undoubtedly  affect  the  character  of  the"
"persons  concerned  and  their  reputation  and  integrity  and  ruin  their  careers  in  addition  to"
"making  them  suffer  civic  disabilities  under  the  two  laws.  The  determinations  of  the  two"
"Commissioners would grievously affect these persons of their own force, proprio vigor. The"
"conclusions would therefore have to be arrived at by a process consistent with the rules of"
"natural  justice  after  informing  the  party  of  the  case  against  him  and  affording  him  an"
"opportunity to defend himself."
