The appellant, Matuarata Plantations Limited states that, the land in question called Diddenipotha Estate is over 600 hectares in extent. It has originally been owned by a private party and thereafter, had been vested with the Land Reform Commission in terms of Land Reform Law No. 01 of 1972. Subsequently, a portion of the said 600 hectares land had been acquired by the State by virtue of an order of the Minister of Land, published in Gazette (Extraordinary) dated 18.09.1974, made in terms of proviso (a) to section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act. Thereafter, the said land has been handed over to the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) in the year 1982. 3. Consequently, in terms of section 2(2) of the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987, and as per Gazette No. 720/02 dated 22.06.1992 the appellant was incorporated to take over the functions and carry on the business of the SLSPC. 4. Thereafter, by letter dated 14.06.2007, which was a letter to the Plantation Ministry by the Divisional Secretariat (2nd Respondent) that was copied to the appellant, the appellant had been notified that, a divesting order has been made in the Gazette Extra Ordinary No. 1497/22 of 16.05.2007 in respect of 17 allotments of land in Didenipotha Estate, which constitutes a portion of 50 acres of the said Estate as the land has not been used for the purpose for which it was acquired. 5. Aggrieved by the said divesting order, the appellant company that is currently in possession of the entire estate, instituted action in the Court of Appeal praying for a writ of certiorari quashing the said divesting order made by the Minister of Lands (hereinafter referred to as the 1st respondent) in respect of the said portion of land.",
