S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner, namely Wijetunge Mudiyanselage Lalith Kumara Wjietunge (hereinafter

referred to as “the Petitioner”), filed this application by petition dated 27th June 2014

against the above-named 1st to 18th Respondents (hereinafter sometimes collectively

referred to as “the Respondents”) seeking relief in respect of the alleged infringement

of his fundamental rights guaranteed by and under the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

This Court granted leave to proceed on 29th July 2015 based on alleged violation of

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Factual Overview

The Petitioner, presently holding the position of Grade I Agrarian Development Officer

in the Department of Agrarian Development, lodged this application against the

decision of the 1st Respondent (Commissioner General of Agrarian Development)

and/or 4th to 12th Respondents (members of the Public Service Commission) pertaining

to the promotion of officers, namely the 14th, 15th and 14A Respondents, to the post

of Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development (Departmental) Class III

(hereinafter referred to as “Assistant Commissioner”) over and above the Petitioner in

a manner violative of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1).

As per letters dated 21st January 2013 and 08th March 2013, and annexed Scheme of

Recruitment (marked “P8”, “P9” and “P10” delineated threshold qualifications for

eligibility respectively), applications for the post of Assistant Commissioner were to be

effected through a limited competitive examination followed by a merit-based

interview.

In terms of the preamble to the Scheme of Recruitment (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the “SOR”), applications were so-called to fill 24 vacancies in the post of

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development Class III. Further, Clause 02 of the

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 28

SOR delineated the following threshold qualifications for eligibility to be promoted to

the post of Assistant Commissioner:

i. Five (05) years of active and satisfactory service in the post of Agrarian

Development Officer Grade I;

ii. Five (05) years of satisfactory service immediately preceding the date of

promotion to the post of Assistant Commissioner Agrarian Development

(Departmental) Class III;

iii. Willingness and ability to serve in any part of Sri Lanka and possess sufficient

mental and physical fitness to discharge the duties of the post.

Clause 06.III of the SOR stipulated that applicants were required to possess all

threshold qualifications as described above on or before the closing date for

applications.

The marking scheme appended to the SOR is reproduced below:

iii. Performance at the interview 05 marks

The Petitioner has stated that, having sat for and successfully passed the written

examination, he was called to face the interview panel on 24th October 2013.

Following the interview, the Petitioner learned that 23 applicants, including the 14th to

17th Respondents, were promoted to the post of Assistant Commissioner, but not the

Petitioner himself. The list of successful candidates was published on the Public Service

Commission website, a copy of which was produced and marked “P19”. The

Respondents have submitted that the 24th vacancy was reserved due to a disciplinary

inquiry of an officer selected to be appointed to the post of Assistant Commissioner,

who has since been exonerated from all charges and accordingly promoted.

According to the written submissions of the Respondents dated 11th April 2023, the

Petitioner’s scores at the written examination and merit-based interview, as compared

to the marking scheme within the scheme of recruitment, are as follows:

iii. Performance at the interview 05 marks 03 marks

Thereby, the Petitioner had scored 157 marks in total, whereas, as per the

Respondents, the cut-off mark was 159 marks.

The issues upon which the Petitioner has based the current application primarily

revolve around two key points: first, the failure to receive additional marks under the

'Seniority' category due to the delayed antedating of his Grade I promotion; second,

the denial of additional marks under the 'Merit – Operational Performance' category

for submitting evaluation reports that reflected a profit for the years 2008, 2011 and

2012.

Antedating Grade I Promotion

Expanding upon the first issue, the Petitioner has submitted that he had been

promoted as a Grade I Officer with effect from 14th July 2007 and would have

completed 5 years and 08 months at the closing date of the applications for the

promotion to Assistant Commissioner. By letters dated 04th October 2013 and 25th

September 2013 (marked “P7a” and “P7b” respectively), he had also formally requested

the antedating of his promotion to Grade I to be with effect from 28th August 2006.

The Interview Panel’s knowledge of the Petitioner’s pending application to antedate

his Grade I promotion, which would have awarded the Petitioner an additional 05

marks, and of the said application’s bearing on the Petitioner’s eligibility to be

promoted to the post is evident upon perusal of remarks within the ‘Other’ column of

the interview notes marked “R3”, The reproduced excerpt reads:

“පෙරදාකම් කිරීම සම්බන්ධව උපදෙස්ස් ඉල්ලා ඇත. ඒ අනුව සුදුසුකම් තීරණය කෙරේ.” ේ.”

[Advice is sought regarding ante-dating. Eligibility will be decided accordingly].

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 28

Whereas, as per the Petitioner, the 14th and 15th Respondents, having sat for the Grade

I promotional examination only in 2011, had themselves requested for their own Grade

I promotions to be antedated as they did not satisfy the requirement of possessing 5

years of service to be eligible for the post of Assistant Commissioner at the time

applications were closed and, therefore, did not possess the threshold qualifications

as required by Clause 06.III of the SOR.

In the Respondents’ written submission dated 11th April 2023, the Respondents have

averred that the Petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to

antedate his promotion as a Grade I Officer only on 25th September 2013 and

requested a concession for his Efficiency Bar Qualification only on 07th April 2017.

According to the Respondents, the examination for promotions to the post of Grade I

officers for 2005 was only held in the year 2007. According to the Scheme of

Recruitment for appointments to the post of Grade I Officer, Grade II Officers had to

fulfil, inter alia, 12 years of satisfactory service. The Petitioner, having joined service in

the year 1994, would not have completed 12 years by 2005 and was therefore not

eligible to sit for the examination to promote officers to Grade I for 2005. The

Respondents have submitted that it was due to ‘administrative inadvertence’ that this

requirement was not published in the notice, and the Petitioner, therefore, sat and

passed the exam.

The Respondents have stated that the Public Service Commission, on humanitarian

grounds, decided not to cancel the Petitioner’s promotion to Grade I, and additionally,

to rectify the administrative inadvertence, decided not to antedate the Petitioner’s

promotion to the Post of Grade I Officer. However, upon appeal to the Administrative

Tribunal, the Public Service Commission approved the Petitioner’s request for a

concession on the Petitioner’s Efficiency Bar Examination by decision dated 22nd May

2017 and 31st May 2017 (marked “CA1” and “CA2” respectively) and, subsequently,

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 28

antedated the Petitioner’s appointment as a Grade I Officer by letter dated 07th

December 2017 (marked “CA3”).

Whereas, the 14th and 15th Respondents passed the Grade 01 examination in 2011 and,

after being promoted to the post of Grade I officers, had requested for the antedating

of their promotions. The 14th and 15th Respondents’ requests were approved by the

Public Service Commission on 06th November 2013. According to the Respondents,

the 14th and 15th Respondents were two of 08 officers who had been recommended

by the Director General Establishment with regard to antedating of Grade I promotions

of Agrarian Development Officers. Thereby, the requests of the 14th and 15th

Respondents were approved by the Public Service Commission on 06th November

2013, and the promotions were antedated to 12th November 2007 and 08th December

2006, respectively. The Petitioner’s request to ante-date his Grade I promotion,

however, was granted by the Public Service Commission only on 22nd Mary 2017.

The Respondents have stated that it is the Petitioner’s own failure to request the

antedating of his promotion that the same could not be effected, and therefore, no

marks could have been awarded to the Petitioner at the time of the interview.

Operational Performance Report for 2012

As per the marking scheme within the scheme of recruitment, marks were awarded

under the ‘Merit’ category for the comparative evaluation of service at Agrarian

Development Centres; specifically, 05 marks were allocated for each report that

reflected a profit statement. The Petitioner has stated that he secured profit statements

at the Morayaya Agrarian Development Centre for the years 2008, 2011 and 2012

(marked “P18a”, “P18b” and “P18e”, respectively), which would have totalled 15 marks.

According to the Respondents, the Petitioner only scored 10 marks for the reports

submitted for the years 2008 and 2011 as the report for 2012 was inadequately and/or

incorrectly prepared at the time it was submitted to the interview panel, despite no

proof being submitted in support of this statement. In fact, an Audit Report prepared

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 28

by the Auditor General dated 30th January 2017 (marked CA4) demonstrates that the

Petitioner had indeed recorded a profit for the Morayaya Agrarian Development

Centre in 2012.

The Respondents, in their written submission dated 11th April 2023 have argued that,

nevertheless, no marks could have been awarded to the Petitioner as the interview

panel could only allocate marks for the material submitted on the date of the interview

and not otherwise, in compliance with the SOR.

It is immensely curious, then, as the Petitioner has rightly averred, that the 14A

Respondent (the 16th successful candidate) had been granted the opportunity to

submit documents in proof of comparative evaluation of service after the conclusion

of the interview (document in proof marked “P22”).

The 4B Respondent, in his affidavit dated 18th November 2016, has confirmed that the

14A Respondent was allowed to submit reports as proof of comparative evaluation of

service in the years 2011 and 2012, with certification of the Assistant Commissioner,

subsequent to the date of the interview after receiving assurance from the 14A

Respondent that the reports for the years 2011 and 2012 were in the process of being

drafted.

Analysis

It is pertinent to note that, during the course of these proceedings, it was admitted

that the interview board had incorrectly scored the Petitioner, who should have

received an additional 10 marks and was granted the same by the Department of

Agrarian Development, thereby increasing his score to 163 marks. Accordingly, it was

also admitted that the Petitioner should have received the promotion. The relevant

excerpt of the journal entry dated 31st March 2022 is reproduced below:

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 28

“…DSG who is appearing for the Respondent informs Court that the cut off mark

for the appointment was 159. However, the interview board has given only 153

marks to the Petitioner.

Accordingly, he was not given the promotion. However, thereafter, the Petitioner

has made representation to the Department of Agrarian Development.

Having considered the said representations, the Department of Agrarian

Development has granted additional 10 marks since the interview board has by

an oversight not given the correct marks to the Petitioner. Accordingly, the

Petitioner should have got 163 marks at the interview.

In the circumstances, the Petitioner should have got the promotion along with the

others who were promoted subsequent to the interview held for the

relevant promotions.”

Thereby, it has already been established that the Petitioner should have received the

promotion to Assistant Commissioner. Nevertheless, the question of whether the

Petitioner’s rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution were violated by

the Respondents remains and will be answered in the forthcoming sections of this

judgement.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides as follows:

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of

the law.”

It was observed by Amerasinghe J in Perera v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank

and Ors. (1994) 1 Sri L.R. 152 in that persons are entitled to complain if they were

invidiously or arbitrarily treated by or in the selection process of promotion and or

recruitment to the public sector, and that the essence of these complaints would be

that their right to equality guaranteed by Article 12 of the Constitution has been

violated.

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 28

Early views on the concept of equality mirrored the ‘reasonable classification doctrine’,

as can be seen in the discussion of Article 12 by Chief Justice S. Sharvananda in Elmore

Perera v. Major Montague Jayawickrema, Minister of Public Administration and

Plantation Industries and Others [1985] 1 Sri L.R. 285;

“This Article is violated both by unequal treatment of the equals and equal

treatment of the unequals. The aim of the article is to ensure that invidious

distinction or arbitrary discrimination shall not be made by the State between a

citizen and a citizen who answers the same though the concept of equality does

not involve the idea of absolute equality among human beings. Hence equality

before the law does not mean that things which are different shall be treated as

they were the same. Thus the principle of equality enacted under Article 12 does

not absolutely prevent the State from differentiating between persons and things,

The State has the power of what is known an ''classification'' on a basis of rational

distinction relevant to the particular subject dealt with. So long as all persons

failing into the same class are treated alike there is no question of discrimination

and there is no question of violating the equality clause. The discrimination which

is prohibited is treatment in a manner prejudicial as compared to another person

in similar circumstances. Discrimination is the essence of classification; so long as

it rests on a reasonable basis there is no violation of the constitutional rights of

equality. Article 12 prohibits not only discriminatory legislation in favour of a

particular person as against the others in like condition but it also has reference

to the way the law is administered.

[…]

[A] person setting up grievances of denial of equal treatment must establish that

between persons similarly circumstanced, some were treated to their prejudice

and the differential treatment had no reasonable relevance to the object sought

to be achieved. Before a person can claim to be discriminated against another, he

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 28

must show that the other person was similarly situated or equally circumstanced,

he must make out that not only he had been treated differently from others, but

he had been so treated from persons similarly placed without any reasonable

basis and such differential treatment is unjustifiably made.”

The evolution of the legal concept of equality in Sri Lanka and this Court’s partial

departure from the interpretation of the nature of Article 12(1) developed by Chief

Justice S. Sharvananda has been extensively discussed in cases such as Wijerathna v

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SC/FR/256/2017, SC Minutes of 11th December 2020).

Kodagoda J, while maintaining that the classification doctrine continues to play a

significant role in this Court’s determination of violations of fundamental rights,

discusses the current approach of ‘substantive equality’ adopted by this Court to rights

guaranteed under Article 12 as follows;

“[S]ince the pronouncement of the majority judgment in Elmore Perera v. Major

Montague Jayawickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Plantation

Industries and Others, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has somewhat distanced

itself from the interpretations provided by Chief Justice S. Sharvananda to the

concepts of ‘equality’ and ‘discrimination’, and provided an expansive and more

progressive definition of the concept of equality, founded upon the concept of

‘substantive equality’, aimed at protecting persons from arbitrary, unreasonable,

malicious and capricious executive and administrative action.

[…]

It is necessary to place on record that the ‘reasonable classification doctrine’

continues to play an important role in certain factual situations, in determining

whether the right to equality has been infringed.”

The approach of ‘substantive equality’ is encapsulated in the oft-cited views of former

Chief Justice of India, Justice Bhagwati in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu AIR

1974 SC 555:

“Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot

be cribbed, cabined and confined within traditional doctrinal limits. From a

positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and

arbitrariness are sworn enemies, one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while

the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is

arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and

Constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14.”

The meaning of arbitrariness with regard to the principles enumerated in Article 12(1)

can be understood from the interpretation of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. In

the case of Sharma Transport v. Government of A.P. (2002) 2 SCC 188, it was

observed that:

“The expression ‘arbitrarily’ means: in an unreasonable manner, as fixed or done

capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate determining principle, not founded

in the nature of things, non-rational, not done or acting according to reason or

judgment, depending on the will alone.”

In the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, it was observed:

“The principle of reasonableness, which legally and philosophically, is an essential

element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding

omnipresence.”

The above view was reiterated in R.D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority,

(1979) 3 SCC 489:

“The principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as

philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness is protected

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 28

by Article 14 and it must characterise every State action, whether it be under

authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law.”

Within our own legal framework, Chief Justice Sarath Silva has discussed

reasonableness as a paramount requirement in establishing the basic standard of right

to equality in Wickremasinghe v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others [2001]

2 Sri L.R. 409:

“Although the objective is to ensure that all persons, similarly circumstanced are

treated alike, it is seen that the essence of this basic standard is to ensure

reasonableness being the positive connotation as opposed to arbitrariness being

the related negative connotation.”

It is an established legal principle, then, that reasonableness is an essential element of

non-arbitrariness.

Returning to the instant case, it is hardly necessary to emphasize that, the efficiency

and integrity of the public administration system of a country hinge on the quality and

calibre of the officers who serve that system. Therefore, it becomes imperative to

ensure that the recruitment of such officers is conducted with utmost diligence. A

fundamental aspect of achieving this objective is to ensure that recruitment to the

Public Service of a country is effected according to published procedures which

incorporate proper selection criteria and due and fair process that affords equal

opportunity. Effective governance necessitates an administration of competent public

officials as well as public trust and confidence in that administration.

Clause 06.III of the Scheme of Recruitment (marked P10) for the selection and

appointment of suitable candidates for the post of Assistant Commissioners reads as

follows:

“06. අනෙකුත්ෙකුත් සේවාවා කොන්දේසිේසි

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 28

III. අයදුම්පත්ත් කැඳවීමේ අවසන් දිනටට තනතුරටතුරට බඳවා ගැනීම සඳහා අවශ්‍ය සියළුම

සුදුසුකම් සෑම ආකාරයකින්ම සපුරා තිබිය යුතුය.”

[06. Terms of Service

III. All the qualifications required for recruitment to the post must be

fulfilled in all respects by the last date of application.]

The last date of application was provided in Clause 08.II of the SOR to be 25th March

2013. The Petitioner fulfilled this requirement as he was promoted to Grade I with

effect from 14th July 2007 and thereby completed 05 years of service as a Grade I

Officer by the closing date of applications for the post of Assistant Commissioner.

In contrast, the 14th and 15th Respondents, according to the Written Submissions of

the Respondents dated 11th April 2023, only sat for and passed the exam for the post

of Grade I Officer in 2011 and the requests for the antedating of their promotions were

granted by the Public Service Commission only on 06th November 2013. Evidently, the

14th and 15th Respondents, did not, in fact, possess the threshold qualifications on or

before the date applications for the post were closed, i.e. 25th March 2013.

Moreover, the Respondents have stated that the structured interview for the post of

Assistant Commissioner was held on 24th October 2013 and 13th November 2013. I find

it interesting that the date of the Petitioner’s interview was scheduled to be held on

24th of October 2013, whereas I make the assumption that the interviews of the 14th

and 15th Respondents were held on 13th November 2013 following the approval of

their antedating requests as otherwise, the 14th and 15th Respondents could not have

scored the additional marks as they did under the ‘Seniority’ category.

As discussed, the Respondents’ knowledge of the Petitioner’s pending application to

ante-date is evident in the comments within the interview mark sheet. While the

Respondents have submitted that the Interview Panel could not have awarded

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 28

additional marks to the Petitioner at the time the interview was conducted on 24th

October 2013, I am inclined to be skeptical of the position.

A common theme that emerges within the Respondents’ submission is ‘administrative

inadvertence’; to name a few examples, the Petitioner’s promotion to Grade I due to

an error in the notice published to call for applications; the subsequent effect of this

error on the Petitioner’s request to ante-date his promotion; and the fact that

successful candidates such as the 14th and 15th Respondent did not possess the

required threshold qualifications in accordance with the SOR at the time applications

for the post of Assistant Commissioner were closed. I am forced, then, to ask: is it not

a sequence of administrative inadvertences of the public authorities that has

formulated the obstacle to the Petitioner’s promotion?

Furthermore, despite the Respondents’ own submission that in compliance with the

SOR, the Interview Panel could only allocate marks for the material submitted on the

date of the interview and not otherwise, the Interview Panel allowed the 14A

Respondent to submit material following the interview, whereas the Petitioner was not

afforded or even made aware of this opportunity, which can only be described as

unreasonable and arbitrary decision-making. Perhaps the Respondents would, once

again, cite administrative inadvertence as an explanation.

In light of the abovementioned facts and circumstances, I find that the Petitioner has

been successful in establishing that he has been unreasonably and arbitrarily denied

being appointed as an Assistant Commissioner as a result of the decisions of the 1st

Respondents.

The validity of the decision to antedate the promotions of the 14th and 15th Respondent

has also been challenged by the Petitioner. The Petitioner has submitted that such

promotions are contrary to the provisions of Clause 1.11 read with 1:11:1 of Chapter II

of the Establishments Code, which reads:

Original upload on 29.02.2024 Reupload (with addendum) on 04.04.2024

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 28

“1:11 පහතහත දැක්වෙන අවස්ථාවන්හිි දී කවර හේතුවක්තුවක් නිසා හෝහෝ පෙරදාතම කිරීමක් නොකළකළ

යුතු

1:11:1 එවැනි පෙරදාතම කිරීමක් හේතුවෙන්න් අදාළ නිලධරයාට, එම තනතුරටතුරට හෝහෝ

තනතුරටතුරට තෝරාතෝරා ගැනීමේ දී දෙනුනු ලැබූ ජ්‍යෙෂ්ඨත්ව පිළිවෙළෙහිි යම්

වෙනසක්සක් ඇති වන්නේ නම්ම්.“

[1.11. No pre-dating shall be granted for any of the following reasons:

1.11.1. If by reason of such pre-dating the officer concerned has more

seniority than any officer appointed before him in the said post or grade

or there is a change in the order of seniority given in the selection of that

post.]

It is trite law that the Establishment Code, by virtue of its constitutional origin, acquires

statutory force, and this Court has consistently recognized that the provisions of the

Establishment Code should be complied with and given effect.

This approach is evident in early cases such as Perera vs. Jayawickreme [1985 1 SLR

285], where Wanasundera J, with regard to the Establishment Code, observed that:

“This Code constitutes the norm and embodies the necessary safeguards to

protect the rights of public officers. It constitutes the state of the law on this matter

and is and should be applicable, without exception, to all public officers of the

class or category to which the petitioner belongs. Any departure in a particular

case from this basic norm, which is of general application, would be a deprivation

of the protection given by the law and must be regarded as unequal treatment

and a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.”

Kulatunga J observed in Perera vs. Ranatunga [1993 1 SLR 39 at p.54-55] that the

Code embodies:

S.C. (F/R) 181/2014 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 28

“ ….. a constitutional recognition of the concept of the Rule of law, in particular,

that government should be conducted within the framework of recognized rules

and principles and that, in general, decisions should be predictable and the citizen

should know where he is which in turn restricts arbitrary action or discrimination.

The relevant provisions of the Establishments Code are in conformity with this

concept and through Article 55 (4) are made complementary to Article 12.”.

This ratio has been endorsed and followed in several succeeding judgments of this

Court, a recent example of which is Locomotive Assistants Union v Abeywickrama

(SC/FR 29/2018 SC Minutes dated 16th July 2020).

The decision to antedate the promotions of the 15th Respondent to 08th December

2006 caused the 15th Respondent to gain seniority over the Petitioner, who was

promoted to the post of Grade I Officer with effect from 14th July 2007.

I find that this decision is, therefore, contrary to the provisions of the Establishment

Code and constitutes unequal treatment violative of the Petitioner’s rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Decision

In view of the foregoing circumstances and reasons, I hold that the Respondents have,

by the afore-stated impugned decisions and conduct, jointly infringed the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution

by depriving him of the right to equality.

I further direct that the Petitioner be forthwith appointed to the Post of ‘Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Development (Departmental) Class III’ with back wages and,

based on the updated mark sheet of the structured interview held for the Post of

Assistant Commissioner in 2013, be appointed with the appropriate seniority and rank

in relation to the successful candidates, including the 14th (S.M.P.K Weerasekara

Menike), 14A (H.M. Eranga Atapattu) and 15th (S.Y.D.A. Somawansha) Respondents.
