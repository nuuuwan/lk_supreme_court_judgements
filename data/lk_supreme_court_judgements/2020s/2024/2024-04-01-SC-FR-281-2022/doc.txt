BEFORE : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

A. L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J

MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA, J

COUNSEL : Rushdie Habeeb with Supun Dissanayake

instructed by Azad Mustafa for the

Petitioner.

V. Hettige, SDSG for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 10th

Respondents.

ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 01st April 2024

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner as well as the

submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents.

At the inception, the learned Deputy Solicitor General raised a preliminary objection (time bar)

against the maintainability of this Petition before this Court. The Petition has been filed on 24-

08-2022 challenging the letter dated 08-02-2022 produced marked P 15. Thus, it is clear that

the Petitioner has failed to file his Petition within the time period specified in Article 126(2) of

the Constitution.

As held by this Court previously in the case of Thilangani Kandambi Vs. State Timber

Corporation and others,1 the Petitioner is required to satisfy Court not only about the fact that

he had lodged a complaint to the Human Rights Commission within the permitted time but

also about the fact that an inquiry in relation to that complaint is pending before the Human

Rights Commission.

The Petitioner has failed to satisfy Court that he is entitled to maintain his Petition on the

above basis. Instead, the Petitioner appears to have been content only with the averment in

paragraph 38 of his Petition which refers to a copy of the complaint, the Petitioner claims to

have made to the Human Rights Commission marked P 17.

by the learned Deputy Solicitor General. We proceed to dismiss this Petition without costs.
