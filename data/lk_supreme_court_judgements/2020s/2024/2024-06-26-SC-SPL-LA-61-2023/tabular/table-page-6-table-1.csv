"heard  the  submissions  of  both  parties,  we  proceed  to  determine  forthwith,  the  afore-stated"
"questions of law."
"A
t the outset, we observe that the Order impugned by the Petitioner-Petitioner is an order of the"
"Court of Appeal refusing to issue notices on the Respondent-Respondents. The Court of Appeal"
"has made this Order after the Petitioner-Petitioner had supported his Petition before the Court of"
"Appeal with a view to satisfy Court that it should issue notices on the Respondents. It is at that"
"stage that the Court of Appeal had come to the conclusion that the land relevant to this case"
"claimed by the Petitioner-Petitioner is not a part of the land which had been previously acquired"
"by the State."
"W
e  observe  that  the  only  basis  upon  which  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  had"
"concluded that the Petitioner-Petitioner has failed to satisfy Court that his land is a part of the"
"land which had been previously acquired by the State, is a slight difference in the name of the"
"land. It is the conclusion of the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal that the name of the land"
"claimed by the Petitioner-Petitioner is ‘Welipennagahahena’ but, the name of the land which has"
"been previously acquired by the State is ‘Welipennagahawatta’. Thus, according to the judgment"
"of the Court of Appeal, the highlighted slight difference is only in the end part of the name of the"
"land."
"T
he learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner-Petitioner brought to our notice that the name"
"of the father of the Petitioner-Petitioner has even been mentioned in the list of occupants of the"
"land which the State had previously acquired. Thus, the perusal of those documents adduced in"
"the case and the submissions made by the learned Counsel for both parties led us to the thought"
"that at least some portion of the land claimed by the Petitioner-Petitioner may have stood as a"
"part of the land previously acquired by the State. We are mindful that even a slight difference in"
"the name of the land can sometimes make a dent in establishing the identity of the land in a suit."
"However, given the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we are of the view that the Court"
"of Appeal should have further probed in to this, at a later stage of the case, in more detail before"
"arriving at a final conclusion."
"H
aving considered the above material, we are of the view that this is a fit case in which the Court"
"of  Appeal  should  have  decided  to  issue  notices  on  the  Respondents  after  the  Petitioner  had"
