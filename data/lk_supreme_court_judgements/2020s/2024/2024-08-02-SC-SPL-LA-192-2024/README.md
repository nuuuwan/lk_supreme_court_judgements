ARGUED &

DECIDED ON: 02/08/2024

A. H. M. D. NAWAZ., J

1. The Petitioner before this Court seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 31.05.2024 in which the

Page 4 of 9

Petitioner was ordered to pay an enhanced sum of money as maintenance to

his wife and children.

2. A preliminary objection has been raised by Mr. W. Dayaratne, PC that Section

14(2) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999 which provides for a leave to

appeal application to be made to the High Court has not been complied with

by the Petitioner. The objection in a nutshell is that a direct leave to appeal

will not lie to the Supreme Court, when a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court

must have been made to the High Court.

3. The judgement sought to be impugned before this Court was delivered by the

High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction from an order made by

the Magistrate in maintenance proceedings. In such a situation Section 14(2)

of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 becomes relevant.

4. Section 14(2) of the Act states as follows;

“Any person dissatisfied with an order made by a High Court in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under this Section, may prefer an

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court, on a question of law, with the

leave of High Court, and where such leave is refused, with the

Special Leave of the Supreme Court, first had and obtained.”

5. This provision makes it patently clear that a pre-condition to the invocation of

the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to challenge a decision made by the High

Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in a maintenance appeal is to

seek leave in the first instance from that High Court itself.

6. In terms of Section 14(2) of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999, where the

High Court pronounces an adverse judgment against an appellant in a

maintenance appeal, the appellant is required, in the first instance, to seek

leave to appeal from the very High Court that rendered the decision.

Page 5 of 9

7. If leave is granted, the grant itself ripens into an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Section 14(2) expressly provides that it is only where leave from the High Court

has been sought and refused that a party may thereafter invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court by way of an application for special leave to appeal.

8. The scheme of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999 thus imposes a clear

condition precedent to the invocation of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court

in maintenance appeals emanating from the Magistrate’s Court and carried

through the High Court.

9. Either the grant of leave by the High Court or, upon refusal, the grant of special

leave by this Court, constitutes the sole avenue for engaging the appellate

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in maintenance appeals.

10. As I have already observed, a party to a maintenance appeal in the High Court,

arising from proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court, cannot prefer a direct

application for leave to appeal to this Court when his appeal has been

unsuccessful before the High Court. The Respondent–Appellant–Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as “the Petitioner”) has in the present instance sought

to do precisely that.

11. It is manifestly clear that the Petitioner has not adhered to the procedure

prescribed by the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999. Consequently, the

jurisdiction of this Court has not been properly invoked.

12. It is, however, apposite at this stage to advert to the decision in Antony

Fernando v. Deepthi Lakmali,1 wherein a Petitioner, similarly

circumstanced in that he too had not sought leave from the High Court,

contended before this Court that his right of appeal to the Supreme Court, from

1 (2012) 2 Sri L.R. 81

Page 6 of 9

an unsuccessful appeal to the High Court, derived from the governing general

statute, namely High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No.19 of 1990. That general statute, by Section 9, conferred a right of appeal

in the following terms.

"Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, a person

aggrieved by-

(a) A final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of

the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article

154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act or any other law,

in any matter or proceeding whether civil or criminal which

involved a substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to

the Supreme Court if the High Court grants leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved

party to such matter or proceeding:

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant

special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or

interlocutory order, judgment, decree or sentence made by such

High Court, in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it

by paragraph (3) (b) of the Article 154P of the Constitution or

section 3 of this Act, or any other law where such High Court has

refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, or where in

the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for

review by the Supreme Court:

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to

appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that

the question to be decided is of public or general importance;..."

Page 7 of 9

13. This Court in Antony Fernando was therefore invited to treat the right of

appeal as flowing directly from Section 9 of the said statute, notwithstanding

the procedural regime introduced by subsequent legislation. That contention,

however, was ultimately found to be misplaced, for the later special enactment

had prescribed a distinct procedural route which could not be circumvented by

reliance on the general statute.

14. In advancing his argument, the Petitioner in Antony Fernando v. Deepthi

Lakmali (supra) appears to have overlooked that Section 9 of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of 1990 expressly contemplated

that the right of appeal to the Supreme Court could be regulated by subsequent

legislation. Significantly, Section 9 of the Act opens with the words “Subject to

the provisions of this Act or any other law,” thereby recognizing that the general

law embodied in the Act itself is always susceptible to amendment or

modification of condition precedents by a special enactment. An amendment

could change the procedure as regards appeals.

15. Accordingly, no inconsistency arises between the provisions of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990 and those of the

Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999. The invocation of the maxim generalia

specialibus non derogant in Antony Fernando v. Deepthi Lakmali (supra)

is therefore misplaced, for that maxim becomes relevant only where there

exists a genuine conflict between a special law and a general law. In the

present context, the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999 does not derogate from

the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, but

rather operates as a special enactment carving out a limited exception in

respect of appeals to the Supreme Court in maintenance matters.

16. It is also evident that policy considerations underlie this legislative scheme,

which necessitated the requirement that leave be first sought from the High

Court. This requirement under Section 14(2) is of a piece with a clear

Page 8 of 9

legislative policy to regulate and restrict recourse to the Supreme Court in

maintenance matters, by ensuring that appellate intervention is invoked

through a designated channel, and only in conformity with the procedure laid

down in the Amendment Act.

17. It is true that in Antony Fernando v. Deepthi Lakmali (supra) this Court,

somewhat infelicitously, invoked the maxim generalia specialibus non

derogant despite the absence of any true conflict between the general statute

and the special enactment. Nevertheless, the Court arrived at the correct

conclusion—namely, that no direct leave to appeal lies to the Supreme Court

dehors the procedural scheme of the Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999. The more

appropriate approach, however, would have been to give direct and exclusive

effect to the special legislation itself. Where Parliament has prescribed a

specific procedure in a special enactment, that procedure must be scrupulously

observed notwithstanding the existence of a general enactment prescribing a

broader course. The Maintenance Act, No. 37 of 1999, as the later and more

particular expression of legislative intent, unequivocally imposes the

requirement that leave be sought in the first instance from the High Court.

18. Upon a careful perusal of the record, this Court finds no evidence of an

application for leave having been made to the learned High Court Judge.

19. It is no doubt permissible for such an application to be made ore tenus (that

is, orally in open court). However, if the learned High Court Judge were invited

to exercise his power in that regard, he would have been bound to advert to the

making of such an application in his order, whether granting or refusing leave.

20. The absence of any such reference in the impugned order to an application of

this nature persuades this Court to the conclusion that no such application

was, in fact, made to the High Court.

21. In the circumstances, as it is apparent that there is no proper application

before this Court, we proceed to refuse this application.
