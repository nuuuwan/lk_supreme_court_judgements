"","appear  before  this  Court.  It  was  also  observed  that  he  had  failed  to  show  cause  as"
"","directed in the Rule. The Respondent was not contactable by the Registry and the Court"
"","has attempted to serve notices even through the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, to no avail."
"","It is due to this default that the Court suspended the Respondent from practice pending"
"","the final decision of the inquiry."
