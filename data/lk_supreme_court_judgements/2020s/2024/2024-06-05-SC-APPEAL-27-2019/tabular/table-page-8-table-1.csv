"the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice"
"if the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in"
"his favour..... the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt  but  nothing  short  of"
"that  will suffice.”"
"As per section 3 of the Evidence ordinance “A fact is said to be proved when,"
"after  considering  the  matters  before  it,  the  court  either  believes  it  to  exist  or"
"considers 
its  existence  so  probable 
that  a  prudent  man  might,  under 
the"
"circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.”"
"In  this  case,  the  prosecution  relies  heavily  on  the  testimonies  provided  by  the"
"witnesses 
to  prove 
the  guilt  of 
the  Accused.  PW2  and  PW3 
testimonies"
"collaborate  the  testimony  of  PW1  regarding  the  incident  and  the  sequence  of"
"events. The credibility of a witness is a question of fact, not of law. Appellate"
"judges have repeatedly stressed the importance of the trial judges’ observations"
"of the demeanor of witnesses in deciding questions of fact."
"Lord Pearce in Onnassi v. Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyds Reports 403  stated that"
"'one thing is clear, not so much as a rule of law but rather as a working rule of"
"common  sense.  A 
trial 
judge  has,  except  on  rare  occasions,  a  very  great"
"advantage over an appellate court; evidence of a witness heard and seen has a"
"very great advantage over a transcript of that evidence; and a court of appeal"
"should never interfere unless it is satisfied both that the judgment ought not to"
"stand and that the divergence of view between the trial judge and the court of"
"appeal  has  not  been  occasioned  by  any  demeanor  of  the  witnesses  or  truer"
"atmosphere of the trial (which may have eluded the appellate court) or by any"
"other of those advantages which the trial judge possesses'."
"Considering the testimonies provided by PW1 and PW2, it is evident that PW2"
"promptly complained to the relevant Police Stations that her husband had been"
"kidnapped by the Appellants immediately after the incident had taken place. PW1"
"in his testimony stated that the Appellants informed him that they were taking"
"him to Dehiattakandiya and they had dropped him at Hasalaka town. PW1 also"
"maintained in his examination in chief that the 5th Accused was armed with a"
"pistol. PW1 testified that he was afraid that the Appellants were actually attached"
"to 
the  Uda  Dumbara  Police  station  owing 
to  which  he  had  proceeded 
to"
"Theldeniya Police Station and lodged a complaint about the incident. The two"
"witnesses' testimonies have remained for the most part consistent throughout the"
"trial."
