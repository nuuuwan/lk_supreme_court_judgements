Background

This is an action for malicious prosecution based on actio injuriarum. The

plaintiff was charged in the Magistrates Court under the Electricity Act

for theft of electricity by tampering with electric meters of his business

premises. After trial, he was acquitted. Thereafter he filed action in the

District Court seeking damages against six defendants. The 1st defendant

is the Ceylon Electricity Board and the 2nd-6th defendants are its

employees. The 2nd defendant led the team that raided the premises, with

the 3rd to 5th defendants accompanying him to assist. The 6th defendant

engineer has not participated in the raid but has estimated the probable

loss to the Electricity Board.

After trial, the District Court entered judgment for the plaintiff. On

appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal reversed it. Hence this appeal by

the plaintiff to this Court.

The 2nd and 6th defendants have died when the trial was in progress in

the District Court (journal entry No. 53 dated 25.09.2013) but the trial

has proceeded as usual without considering whether substitution is

necessary and whether cause of action survives against the other

defendants. There is no reference in the judgment of the District Court

5

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

about the death of the 2nd and 6th defendants. The District Judge entered

judgment against all the defendants.

When the matter was supported for leave before this Court on

30.03.2023, as evidenced by the proceedings of that date, learned

Additional Solicitor General for the defendant-respondents raised a

preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeal based on the

death of the 2nd and 6th defendants pending trial and proceeding with the

trial without taking any steps in that regard. Learned counsel for the

plaintiff informed this Court that he wished to continue with the appeal

without proceeding against the 2nd and 6th defendants. I will briefly deal

with this preliminary objection at the end of this judgment.

The ingredients of the tort of malicious prosecution

Malicious prosecution attempts to strike a balance between individual

protection from harassment by litigation and promoting cooperation in

law enforcement. Prof. J.G. Fleming, The Law of Torts, 7th edn (1987),

page 579, elucidates the rationale behind the tort of malicious

prosecution in the following manner:

The tort of malicious prosecution is dominated by the problem of

balancing two countervailing interests of high social importance: the

desire to safeguard the individual from being harassed by

unjustifiable litigation and the policy of encouraging citizens to aid

in law enforcement. On one side, it needs no emphasis that the

launching of scandalous charges is apt to expose the accused to

serious injury, involving his honour and self-respect as well as his

reputation and credit in the community. Malicious prosecution,

therefore, bears close resemblance to defamation, both being

infringements of essentially the same complex of interests on the

part of the plaintiff. On the other side, however, is the competing

6

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

interest of society in the efficient enforcement of the criminal law,

which requires that private persons who co-operate in bringing

would-be offenders to justice, should be adequately protected

against the prejudice which is likely to ensue from termination of the

prosecution in favour of the accused.

Prof. R.G. McKerron has dedicated Chapter XIV (pages 302-309) of his

masterpiece, The Law of Delict A Treatise on the Principles of Liability for

Civil Wrongs in the Law of South Africa, 4th edn (1952), on malicious

prosecution. He states:

In an action for malicious prosecution or other malicious abuse of

process, the plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant instituted the

proceedings; (2) that the defendant acted without reasonable and

probable cause; (3) that the defendant was actuated by malice; and

(4) in the case of certain classes of proceedings, that the proceedings

terminated in his favour.

In order to succeed in a lawsuit for damages on malicious prosecution,

the plaintiff must prove that the defendant:

(a) Instituted or initiated legal proceedings against the plaintiff;

(b) acted without reasonable and probable cause;

(c) acted with malicious intent;

(d) that the proceedings concluded in favour of the plaintiff; and

(e) resulted in actual injury to reputation or the person or pecuniary

interests of the plaintiff.

The burden lies on the plaintiff to prove all of them, and there is no

corresponding burden on the defendant to disprove them. For instance,

even if the defendant had acted maliciously in instituting proceedings, if

there was reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution, the

plaintiffs action will fail.

7

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

Institution of proceedings

Under the first element, the institution of proceedings, the plaintiff must

prove that the defendant initiated, instituted or continued legal

proceedings, thereby demonstrating that it was the defendant who set

the law in motion against him. It can be proved that the defendant

directly instituted the proceedings or that the proceedings were instituted

at his instigation. In the case of the latter, the identification of the

appropriate defendant is not always straightforward. In the House of

Lords case of Glinski v. Mclver [1962] AC 726, Viscount Radcliffe at pages

756-757 and Lord Devlin at page 775 observed that the prosecutor who

effectively sets criminal proceedings in motion, should accept the form of

responsibility or accountability imposed by the tort of malicious

prosecution.

The defendant must have been actively instrumental in setting the law in

motion. Prof. J.G. Fleming states at page 582 To incur liability, the

defendant must play an active role in the conduct of the proceedings, as

by instigating or setting them in motion. In Saravanamuttu v.

Kanagasabai (1942) 43 NLR 357 at 539, Howard C.J. stated that there

must be something more than a mere giving of information to the Police or

other authority who institutes a prosecution. There must be the formulation

of a charge or something in the way of solicitation, request or incitement of

proceedings.

In Commercial Union Assurance Co of NZ Ltd v. Lamont [1989] 3 NZLR

187, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand stated that a person may be

regarded as the prosecutor if he puts the police in possession of

information which virtually compels an officer to bring a

charge. McMullin J. held at 207-208:

8

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

As a general rule a prosecution will be considered to be brought

when the information is laid and by the person who lays it. In the

result, in prosecutions under the Crimes Act of 1961, as was Mr.

Lamonts, the police will generally be treated as the prosecutor and

no action for malicious prosecution will lie against the person on

whose information the police have acted. But in some cases the

person who supplied the information to the police may be regarded

as the prosecutor if, inter alia, he puts the police in possession of

information which virtually compels an officer to lay an information;

if he deliberately deceives the police by supplying false information

in the absence of which the police would not have proceeded; or if

he withholds information in the knowledge of which the police would

not prosecute.

The defendant cannot easily take up the position that it is up to the police

to institute proceedings after investigating a complaint and therefore a

cause of action on malicious prosecution cannot be maintained against

him. In Martin v. Watson [1996] AC 74, a woman complained to the police

that her neighbour had indecently exposed himself to her. The police

initiated legal proceedings. At the hearing before the Magistrates Court,

the prosecution failed to produce any evidence, resulting in the dismissal

of the case. The House of Lords held that, since the facts relating to the

alleged offence were solely within the complainants knowledge, and the

complainant had in substance procured the prosecution, with the police

officer filing the case without exercising any independent discretion, the

complainant could be sued for malicious prosecution, and upheld the

award of damages against her.

In Haturusinghe v. Kudaduraya (1954) 56 NLR 60 at 64, Fernando A.J.

held:

9

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

I am of opinion that a first information given to the Police is sufficient

to found an action for malicious prosecution if it actually contains a

clear allegation that the plaintiff committed an offence, or, in other

words, if it formulates a charge against the plaintiff. While it is

correct that the Police have a discretion whether or not to prosecute,

it is nevertheless their duty to prosecute if they form the opinion that

the allegation may be true. If they do form such an opinion,

particularly in a case where there appears to be corroboration from

a source named by the informant, he can surely not be permitted to

plead that the Police should not have acted upon his allegation.

A defendant may incur liability not only for initiating proceedings but also

for adopting or continuing with the proceedings. Thus, a prosecution,

commenced under a bona fide belief in the guilt of the accused, may

become actionable if, at a later stage, the prosecutor acquires positive

knowledge of the accuseds innocence yet persists in seeking a conviction.

(Fitzjohn v. Mackinder (1861) 9 C.B. (N.S.) 505 at 531)

Absence of probable and reasonable cause

The plaintiff must prove that the defendant instituted the proceedings

without reasonable and probable cause. Reasonable and probable cause

refers to an honest belief, based on reasonable grounds, that the

initiation of the proceedings was justified. In assessing whether there was

reasonable and probable cause for bringing a charge, it is necessary to

conduct both an objective and subjective assessment.

The objective sufficiency of the material considered by the prosecutor

must be assessed in light of all of the facts of the particular case. In Hicks

v. Faulkner (1878) 8 QBD 167 at 171, Hawkins J. defined reasonable and

probable cause as an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon

a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a

10

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably

lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the

accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of

the crime imputed.

The element of reasonable and probable cause is not abstract or purely

objective. The question is whether the prosecutor had reasonable and

probable cause to do what he did; not whether, regardless of the

prosecutors knowledge or belief, there was reasonable and probable

cause for a charge to be framed.

The plaintiff must establish that the defendant did not honestly form the

view that there was a proper case for prosecution or formed that view on

an insufficient basis. On behalf of the High Court of Australia, in A v.

New South Wales [2007] HCA 10, Gleeson C.J., Gummow, Kirby, Hayne,

Heydon and Crennan JJ. stated at paragraph 80:

In cases where the prosecutor acted on material provided by third

parties, a relevant question in an action for malicious prosecution

will be whether the prosecutor is shown not to have honestly

concluded that the material was such as to warrant setting the

processes of the criminal law in motion. (There may also be a real

and lively question about the objective sufficiency of the material,

but that may be left to one side for the moment.) In deciding the

subjective question, the various checks and balances for which the

processes of the criminal law provide are important. In particular, if

the prosecutor was shown to be of the view that the charge would

likely fail at committal, or would likely be abandoned by the Director

of Public Prosecutions, if or when that officer became involved in the

prosecution, absence of reasonable and probable cause would be

demonstrated. But unless the prosecutor is shown either not to have

honestly formed the view that there was a proper case for

11

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

prosecution, or to have formed that view on an insufficient basis, the

element of absence of reasonable and probable cause is not

established.

The proof of absence of probable and reasonable cause is a heavier

burden, as the plaintiff is expected to prove the negative. In Haturusinghe

v. Kudaduraya (supra), Fernando A.J. at pages 64-65 considered this as

a somewhat unusual burden cast on the plaintiff, and states that in

determining whether or not the plaintiff had discharged this burden, the

Court needs to take into account all factors. Each case must depend upon

its own circumstances.

In order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, the

plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted without reasonable

and probable cause. The burden is clearly on the plaintiff. Corea v.

Pieris (1908) 10 N.L.R. 321; (1909) 12 N.L.R. 147 (P.C.). Indeed

Winfield [Law of Tort, 4th Ed.] at p. 617 points out that in this respect

the plaintiff is compelled to undertake a task commonly supposed

to be impossible to prove a negative. It is necessary therefore to

examine the manner in which the learned District Judge has

approached the question of lack of reasonable and probable cause.

He examines the evidence both of the plaintiff and the defendant

and concludes that the charge was a false one, and therefore that it

was made without reasonable and probable cause. I do not think

however that this conclusion was justified having regard to the

circumstances in which the complaint was made circumstances

which the Judge should have considered in determining whether or

not the plaintiff had discharged the somewhat unusual burden cast

on him in an action of this description. The plaintiff had himself

admitted an exchange of blows between himself and the defendant

on the morning in question, but he nevertheless made no complaint

12

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

of the assault to the authorities. On the other hand the defendant

made a very prompt complaint to the Headman and then to the

Police. This indicates the probability that the incident of the morning

had caused more resentment in the mind of the defendant than in

that of the plaintiff. If the defendant did so resent the blows which

the plaintiff admits were exchanged it might well be that in that state

of mind his allegation of theft was an embellishment made merely in

anger. It may, I think be assumed, says Cave J. in Brown v.

Hawkes (1891) 2 Q.B.D. at p. 722, that the defendant was angry;

but so far from this being a wrong or indirect motive, it is one of the

motives on which the law relies to secure the prosecution of

offenders, against the criminal law. Then there was evidence that

the defendant did at the time of the incident and in the presence of

the plaintiff refer to the loss of his purse. The learned Judge has

failed to consider the question whether the purse was actually lost,

and if so whether the allegation of theft may have been made

mistakenly. The fact that the defendant attempted subsequently to

substantiate this allegation in his evidence to the Magistrate does

not lead to the necessary inference that the original complaint was

made without reasonable and probable cause. I think that the

learned Judge should also have taken into consideration the fact

that although the defendant made an allegation that the plaintiff

took his purse, it was in the main a complaint of assault, which latter

complaint could not possibly have been held to have been made

without reasonable and probable cause. I think therefore that the

plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proving that the

complaint was made without reasonable and probable cause.

The fact that the proof of the lack of probable and reasonable cause

depends on the facts and circumstances of each individual case was

13

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

underscored in A v. New South Wales (supra) at paragraph 61 in the

following manner:

Because the absence of reasonable and probable cause is

understood as containing both subjective and objective elements,

one of the chief forensic difficulties confronting a plaintiff is how to

establish what the prosecutor (the defendant in the civil proceeding)

had in his or her mind when instituting or maintaining the

prosecution. Absent some admission by the defendant, the plaintiff

must make the case by inference and, if the defendant gives

evidence, by cross-examination. The shape of the forensic contest in

the particular case will inevitably dictate the way in which the

plaintiff puts the argument that absence of reasonable and probable

cause is established. In particular, what, if anything, the defendant

prosecutor says in court, or has said out of court, about why he or

she launched the prosecution, will loom very large in the plaintiffs

contentions about absence of reasonable and probable cause. It

must be recognised that much of what is said in the decided cases

about want of reasonable and probable cause is moulded by the

nature of the forensic contest in the particular case.

The prosecutor must believe that the accused is probably guilty of the

offence. This belief must be based on information available to the

prosecutor indicating such guilt, rather than mere speculation or

conjecture. In Herniman v. Smith [1938] AC 305 at 319, Lord Atkin stated:

It is not required of any prosecutor that he must have tested every

possible relevant fact before he takes action. His duty is not to

ascertain whether there is a defence, but whether there is

reasonable and probable cause for a prosecution.

14

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

In the case of Karunaratne v. Karunaratne (1959) 63 NLR 365 at 370,

Basnayake C.J. emphasised the burden cast on the plaintiff in action for

malicious prosecution in the following terms:

In the instant case the plaintiff has failed to establish anything more

than a mere giving of information to the police authorities, and is

therefore not entitled to succeed. To succeed in an action of this

nature the plaintiff must establish that the charge was false, and

false to the knowledge of the person giving the information, that it

was made with a view to prosecution, that it was made animo

injuriandi and not with a view to vindicate public justice, and that it

was made without probable cause. In the instant case the plaintiff

has failed to discharge the burden that rests on him.

Justice Tilakawardane in Silva v. Silva [2002] 2 Sri LR 29 and Justice

Salam in Jayawickrema v. Lanka Electricity Board [2007] 2 Sri LR 406

highlighted these criteria as fundamental components in cases involving

malicious prosecution.

Proof of malice

In essence, in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must

prove on a balance of probabilities that the unsuccessful prosecution was

initiated by the defendant without reasonable and probable cause and

with malice. Absence of reasonable and probable cause may, in a given

case, be evidence of malice but not decisive. The positive requirement of

malice, and the negative requirement of absence of reasonable and

probable cause, remain as separate elements which the plaintiff must

prove in order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution.

The critical element in a case of malicious prosecution is proof of malice

on the part of the defendant and not proof of unsuccessful prosecution,

which can happen due to various reasons, including negligence on the

15

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

part of the police to prosecute the case diligently and thereby failure to

prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The failure to prove the

charge does not ipso facto prove malice. The tort of malicious prosecution

is not available to all who have been unsuccessfully prosecuted.

Malice is a broader concept than ill-will or spite; it signifies an improper

purpose, one not intended for lawful enforcement of the law. Anything

other than a desire to uphold justice falls within the ambit of malice. Prof.

J.G. Fleming whilst stating at page 590 that Malice has proved a

slippery word in the law of torts, and should long have been replaced by

improper purpose explains:

At the root of it is the notion that the only proper purpose for the

institution of criminal proceedings is to bring an offender to justice

and thereby aid in the enforcement of the law, and that a prosecutor

who is primarily animated by a different aim steps outside the pale,

if the proceedings also happen to be destitute of reasonable cause.

Malice is a state of mind and implies an intent to injure a person. Hence

it involves ascertainment of the intention in instituting legal proceedings.

It may be practically difficult to prove malice by direct evidence. The proof

of malice will often be a matter of inference from other facts established

in Court.

Blacks Law Dictionary (11th edition) pages 1145-1146 defines malice as

follows:

malice, n. (14c) 1. The intent, without justification or excuse, to

commit a wrongful act. 2. Reckless disregard of the law or of a

persons legal rights. Also termed abandoned and malignant heart;

abandoned heart; malignant and abandoned heart. 3. Ill will;

wickedness of heart. This sense is most typical in nonlegal contexts.

16

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

Malice means in law wrongful intention. It includes any intent

which the law deems wrongful, and which therefore serves as a

ground of liability. Any act done with such an intent is, in the

language of the law, malicious, and this legal usage has etymology

in its favour. The Latin malitia means badness, physical or moral

wickedness in disposition or in conduct not specifically or exclusively

ill-will or malevolence; hence the malice of English law, including all

forms of evil purpose, design, intent, or motive. [But] intent is of two

kinds, being either immediate or ulterior, the ulterior intent being

commonly distinguished as the motive. The term malice is applied in

law to both these forms of intent, and the result is a somewhat

puzzling ambiguity which requires careful notice. When we say that

an act is done maliciously, we mean one of two distinct things. We

mean either that it is done intentionally, or that it is done with some

wrongful motive. John Salmond, Jurisprudence 384 (Glanville L.

Williams ed., 10th ed. 1947).

[M]alice in the legal sense imports (1) the absence of all elements of

justification, excuse or recognized mitigation, and (2) the presence of

either (a) an actual intent to cause the particular harm which is

produced or harm of the same general nature, or (b) the wanton and

willful doing of an act with awareness of a plain and strong

likelihood that such harm may result... The Model Penal Code does

not use malice because those who formulated the Code had a blind

prejudice against the word. This is very regrettable because it

represents a useful concept despite some unfortunate language

employed at times in the effort to express it. Rollin M. Perkins &

Ronald N. Boyce, Criminal Law 860 (3d ed. 1982).

Prof. R.G. McKerron, at page 307 states:

17

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

The plaintiff must prove that the defendant was actuated by malice.

[Hart v. Cohen 16 S.C. 363] By malice is to be understood not

necessarily personal spite and ill-will, but any improper or indirect

motive. [per Kotze, J.P. in Fyne v. African Realty Trust 1906 E.D.C.

257] Thus, in the wrong of malicious prosecution malice may be

defined as some motive other than a desire to bring to justice a

person whom one honestly believes to be guilty. [Brown v. Hawkes

1891 2 Q.B. 723]

In A v. New South Wales (supra) it was held at paragraphs 91 and 92 that

what the plaintiff has to prove in order to establish malice in an action

for malicious prosecution is that the defendant acted for a purpose other

than a proper purpose:

What is clear is that, to constitute malice, the dominant purpose of

the prosecutor must be a purpose other than the proper invocation of

the criminal law an illegitimate or oblique motive. That improper

purpose must be the sole or dominant purpose actuating the

prosecutor.

Purposes held to be capable of constituting malice (other than spite

or ill will) have included to punish the defendant and to stop a civil

action brought by the accused against the prosecutor. But because

there is no limit to the kinds of other purposes that may move one

person to prosecute another, malice can be defined only by a

negative proposition: a purpose other than a proper purpose. And

as with absence of reasonable and probable cause, to attempt to

identify exhaustively when the processes of the criminal law may

properly be invoked (beyond the general proposition that they should

be invoked with reasonable and probable cause) would direct

attention away from what it is that the plaintiff has to prove in order

18

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

to establish malice in an action for malicious prosecution a

purpose other than a proper purpose.

In A v. New South Wales, which I quoted in my judgment several times,

A, a New South Wales police service employee, was charged with

homosexual intercourse with his 12 and 10-year-old stepsons, D and C,

when they were aged eight and nine respectively. The complaint was by

an unidentified complainant. The 2nd respondent police officer was part

of the joint investigation team. At committal proceedings, C admitted his

evidence was false and that he lied to help his brother D who disliked A

intensely. The Magistrate discharged A on both counts, concluding there

was no reasonable prospect that a jury could convict him. A commenced

proceedings for malicious prosecution. The District Court inter alia

accepted the evidence of As solicitor where the 2nd defendant told the

solicitor after the Magistrates Court case that he (the 2nd defendant)

regretted charging A, which he did under pressure since A was a police

employee and if it had been up to him, he would not have done so. The

District Court held with A and awarded compensation for malicious

prosecution. On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of

the District Court. The High Court restored the judgment of the District

Court and stated at paragraph 108:

The second respondent said that he had been under pressure to

charge the appellant because he worked for the Police Service and

that if it was up to me I wouldnt have charged him. Whether these

words were said and, if they were, what was meant by them, were

issues to be determined by the trial judge according to the whole of

the evidence led at trial. It was open to the trial judge to conclude,

as he did, that the words were said, and that they were intended,

not as words of solace, but as a true reflection of the second

respondent's frame of mind at the time he laid the charges. It was

19

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

therefore open to the trial judge to conclude, as he did, that the

charges were laid not for the purpose of bringing a wrongdoer to

justice but for some other purpose. That other purpose was

described as succumbing to pressure.

Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 17th edn (1995), at page 757 states:

The term malice in this form of action is not to be considered in the

sense of spite or hatred against an individual, but of malus animus,

and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect

motives. The proper motive for a prosecution is, of course, a desire to

secure the ends of justice. If a plaintiff satisfies a jury, either

negatively that this was not the true or predominant motive of the

defendant or affirmatively that something else was, he proves his

case on the point. Mere absence of proper motive is generally

evidenced by the absence of reasonable and probable cause. The

jury, however, are not bound to infer malice from unreasonableness;

and in considering what is unreasonable they are not bound to take

the ruling of the judge.

Application of the law to the facts of the case

In the instant case, the defendants position was that they acted bona

fide on a complaint received by the Ceylon Electricity Board and did not

particularly target the plaintiff with malice. The raid in question was

conducted alongside other raids on the same day. They maintained that

they were simply exercising their powers under the Electricity Act, and

that due process was followed during the raid. Furthermore, there is no

evidence of verbal abuse or altercation between the parties during the

raid. The 2nd defendant, who was the team leader, decided that the

electric meters had been tampered with. The 2nd defendant stated in his

20

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

evidence that he had over ten years of experience as an investigation

officer and had conducted approximately 6000 investigations.

In the context of a public prosecution initiated by a police officer or

another authority, where the prosecutor lacks personal interest in the

matter and has no personal knowledge of the parties, and is merely

fulfilling a public duty, these factors, along with the institutional

framework within which the decision to prosecute is made, are pertinent

in determining the presence of malice.

The main, if not sole, reason for the District Judge to conclude that the

defendants, particularly the 2nd defendant, acted maliciously is their

failure to obtain expert opinion or scientific evidence confirming

tampering with the meters prior to initiating proceedings in the

Magistrates Court.

evidence confirming tampering with the meters does not establish that

the prosecution was malicious.

The overzealousness of law enforcement authorities to swiftly apprehend

wrongdoers does not amount to malice, nor does incompetence,

irresponsibility or negligence on the part of the defendants. In order to

constitute malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must prove that the

defendants acted with intentional malice.

22

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

In Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General) (2001) 206 DLR (4th) 1 (SCC), the

Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 35:

As such, a suit for malicious prosecution must be based on more than

recklessness or gross negligence. Rather, it requires evidence that

reveals a willful and intentional effort on the Crowns part to abuse

or distort its proper role within the criminal justice system. In the civil

law of Quebec, this is captured by the notion of intentional fault.

The key to a malicious prosecution is malice, but the concept of

malice in this context includes prosecutorial conduct that is fueled

by an improper purpose or, in the words of Lamer J.

in Nelles, supra, a purpose inconsistent with the status of minister

of justice.

The Court affirmed this view in Miazga v. Kvello Estate [2009] 3 SCR 339

(SCC) at paragraphs 80-81:

While the absence of a subjective belief in reasonable and probable

cause is relevant to the malice inquiry, it does not equate with malice

and does not dispense with the requirement of proof of an improper

purpose. By requiring proof of an improper purpose, the malice

element ensures that liability will not be imposed in cases where a

prosecutor proceeds, absent reasonable and probable grounds, by

reason of incompetence, inexperience, honest mistake, negligence or

even gross negligence.

South African courts have followed the same approach. In Minister of

Justice and Constitutional Development and Others v. Moleko [2008] 3 All

SA 47 (SCA), the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa held at

paragraph 64:

The defendant must thus not only have been aware of what he or

she was doing in instituting or initiating the prosecution, but must at

23

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

least have foreseen the possibility that he or she was acting

wrongfully, but nevertheless continued to act, reckless as to the

consequences of his or her conduct (dolus eventualis). Negligence on

the part of the defendant (or, I would say, even gross negligence) will

not suffice.

Although it is the plaintiffs burden to prove malice, in this case, the

District Judge has shifted the burden onto the defendants to disprove it.

There is no presumption of malice in the institution of legal proceedings.

The District Judge states

. After analysing the defence

evidence in the light of want of scientific evidence, the District Judge

states

. This is a misapplication of the burden of proof.

The plaintiff in his evidence admitted that the 3rd-5th defendants did not

act maliciously against him and they were merely carrying out the

directions given by the 2nd defendant who was the team leader.

The 2nd defendant also in his evidence clearly stated that the 3rd-5th

defendants carried out his orders. The 4th and 5th defendants were

labourers.

According to the evidence of the 3rd defendant, the 3rd defendant was also

a labourer who has studied up to Grade 6.

The 3rd-5th respondents have not set the law in motion for the plaintiff to

be prosecuted before the Magistrates Court, nor is there any evidence

that the 3rd-5th respondents were actuated by malice. There is no case

against the 3rd-5th respondents for malicious prosecution.

The plaintiff has also failed to prove malice on the part of the 2nd

respondent in instituting legal proceedings before the Magistrates Court.

Even assuming that malice was proved against the 2nd respondent, as I

stated at the beginning, upon the death of the 2nd defendant halfway

26

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

through the trial, the plaintiff abandoned the case against the 2nd

defendant (despite the case having reached the state of litis contestatio).

Hence the cause of action based on malicious prosecution cannot

succeed against the 1st defendant.

After the argument before this Court, the plaintiff has also died. In view

of the above conclusion, there is no necessity to make an order regarding

substitution although learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant states

that substitution is possible since the action has reached the stage of litis

contestatio prior to the death.

Conclusion

The 1st-4th questions of law were raised by the plaintiff and the 5th and

6th questions were raised by the defendants. Those questions and the

answers thereto are as follows:

(1) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in concluding that

the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendants have set the law

in motion to prosecute the plaintiff?

A. Yes. However, the High Court has later accepted that the

defendants have set the law in motion when it stated the

defendant by making the complaint against the plaintiff had

not acted maliciously. This goes to show the basis of the

High Court judgment.

(2) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in holding that

there was no sufficient evidence to establish a wrongful intent

(animus injuriandi) or dolus on the part of the defendants?

A. No. There was no sufficient evidence to establish that the

defendants acted maliciously.

27

SC/APPEAL/63/2023

(3) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in holding that the

plaintiff failed to prove that the defendants acted maliciously

and without reasonable and probable cause?

A. No.

(4) Was there a valid notice of appeal and petition of appeal filed by

the respondents before the High Court?

A. No such objection had been taken before the High Court. In

any event, such defects are curable.

(5) Does the cause of action of the plaintiff survive against the 1st,

3rd, 4th and 5th respondents?

A. On the facts and circumstances of this case, no.

(6) Are the judgments of the District Court and the High Court

nullity against the other defendants as the 2nd and 6th

defendants were dead at the time the judgments were

pronounced?

A. No.

I affirm the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the appeal but

without costs.
