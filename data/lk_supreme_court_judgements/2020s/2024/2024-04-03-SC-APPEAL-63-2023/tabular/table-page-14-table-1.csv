"Basnayake C.J. emphasised the burden cast on the plaintiff in action for"
"malicious prosecution in the following terms:"
"In the instant case the plaintiff has failed to establish anything more"
"than  a  mere  giving  of  information  to  the  police  authorities,  and  is"
"therefore  not  entitled  to  succeed.  To  succeed  in  an  action  of  this"
"nature  the  plaintiff  must  establish  that  the  charge  was  false,  and"
"false to the knowledge of the person giving the information, that it"
"was  made  with  a  view  to  prosecution,  that  it  was  made  animo"
"injuriandi and not with a view to vindicate public justice, and that it"
"was made without probable cause. In the instant case the plaintiff"
"has failed to discharge the burden that rests on him."
