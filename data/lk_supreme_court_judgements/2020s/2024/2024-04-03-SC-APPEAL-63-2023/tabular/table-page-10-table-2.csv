"","In cases where the prosecutor acted on material provided by third"
"","parties,  a  relevant  question  in  an  action  for  malicious  prosecution"
"will  be  whether  the  prosecutor","is  shown  not  to  have  honestly"
"","concluded  that  the  material  was  such  as  to  warrant  setting  the"
"","processes of the criminal law in motion. (There may also be a real"
"","and  lively  question  about  the  objective  sufficiency  of  the  material,"
"","but  that  may  be  left  to  one  side  for  the  moment.) In  deciding  the"
"","subjective question, the various checks and balances for which the"
"","processes of the criminal law provide are important.  In particular, if"

"","likely fail at committal, or would likely be abandoned by the Director"
"","of Public Prosecutions, if or when that officer became involved in the"
"","prosecution,  absence  of  reasonable  and  probable  cause  would  be"
"","demonstrated.  But unless the prosecutor is shown either not to have"
"honestly 
formed
