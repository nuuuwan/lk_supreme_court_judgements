"“improper purpose” explains:"
"At  the  root  of  it  is  the  notion  that  the  only  proper  purpose  for  the"
"institution of criminal proceedings is to bring an offender to justice"
"and thereby aid in the enforcement of the law, and that a prosecutor"
"who is primarily animated by a different aim steps outside the pale,"
"if the proceedings also happen to be destitute of reasonable cause."
