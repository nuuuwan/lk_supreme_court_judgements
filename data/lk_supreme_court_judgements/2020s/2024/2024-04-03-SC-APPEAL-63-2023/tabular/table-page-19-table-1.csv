"therefore  open  to  the  trial  judge  to  conclude,  as  he  did,  that  the"
"charges  were  laid  not  for  the  purpose  of  bringing  a  wrongdoer  to"
"justice  but 
for  some  other  purpose.   That  other  purpose  was"
"described as “succumbing to pressure”."
"Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 17th edn (1995), at page 757 states:"
"The term ‘malice’ in this form of action is not to be considered in the"
"sense of spite or hatred against an individual, but of malus animus,"
"and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect"

"conducted alongside other raids on the same day. They maintained that"
"they were simply exercising their powers under the Electricity Act, and"
"that due process was followed during the raid. Furthermore, there is no"
"evidence  of  verbal  abuse  or  altercation  between  the  parties  during  the"
"raid.  The  2nd  defendant,  who  was  the  team  leader,  decided  that  the"
