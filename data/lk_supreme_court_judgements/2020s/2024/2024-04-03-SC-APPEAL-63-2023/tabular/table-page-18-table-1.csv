"purpose other than a proper purpose."
"In A v. New South Wales, which I quoted in my judgment several times,"
"A,  a  New  South  Wales  police  service  employee,  was  charged  with"
"homosexual intercourse with his 12 and 10-year-old stepsons, D and C,"
"when they were aged eight and nine respectively. The complaint was by"
"an unidentified complainant. The 2nd respondent police officer was part"
"of the joint investigation team. At committal proceedings, C admitted his"
"evidence was false and that he lied to help his brother D who disliked A"
"intensely. The Magistrate discharged A on both counts, concluding there"
"was no reasonable prospect that a jury could convict him. A commenced"
"proceedings 
for  malicious  prosecution.  The  District  Court 
inter  alia"
"accepted  the  evidence  of  A’s  solicitor  where  the  2nd  defendant  told  the"
"solicitor  after  the  Magistrate’s  Court  case  that  he  (the  2nd  defendant)"
"regretted charging A, which he did under pressure since A was a police"
"employee and if it had been up to him, he would not have done so. The"
"District  Court  held  with  A  and  awarded  compensation  for  malicious"
"prosecution.  On  appeal,  the  Court  of  Appeal  set  aside  the  judgment  of"
"the District Court. The High Court restored the judgment of the District"
"Court and stated at paragraph 108:"
