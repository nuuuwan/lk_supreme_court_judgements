"“I am therefore of the opinion that even in a case where there is cogent evidence"
"to establish that an expelled Member of Parliament did not come to Court with"
"clean hands, if this Court finds that the purported expulsion is invalid, ""his seat"
"shall not become vacant"" and he will continue to hold office, and this Court does"
"not have the discretion to make a contrary determination on the sole ground"
"of suppression misrepresentation of material facts, or dismiss the application"
"in  limine.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  therefore  not  necessary  to  make  any"
"findings  in  regard  to  the  question  whether  the  Petitioner  has  suppressed  or"
"misrepresented any material facts in his Petition or in the course of the hearing,"
"and accordingly, the preliminary objection raised by the 3rd Respondent has to"
"be overruled.”"
