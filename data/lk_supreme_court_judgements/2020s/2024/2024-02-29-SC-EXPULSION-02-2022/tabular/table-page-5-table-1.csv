"expelled from the party. Thereafter, on the 8th of December, 2021, he replied to the said letter"
"stating that he was unaware of the decision referred to in the same letter."
"Furthermore,  the  decision  to  vote  against  the  Budget  2022  was  decided  by  the  Political"
"Authority at the meeting held on the 21st of November, 2021, when the petitioner was absent."
"The  petitioner  stated  that  he  did  not  read  the  WhatsApp  messages,  nor  the  other  forms  of"
"communication alleged to have been sent to him by the Political Authority informing him not"
"to vote for the Budget 2022. Hence, he was not aware of the said decision."
"The petitioner stated that he and the 1st respondent exchanged several letters, consequent to"
"which, a purported inquiry was scheduled to be held on the 23rd of May, 2022.  The petitioner"
"also stated that the purported Disciplinary Committee of the party has no jurisdiction to make"
"a decision to expel him from the party. In any event, he informed the 1st respondent that the"

"vote against the Budget. He further stated that he requested for the minutes of the meetings of"
"the Political Authority held on 21st of November, 2021, 22nd of November, 2021, and 12th of"

"was not conversant in the Tamil language. Hence, the counsel for the petitioner requested for"
"additional time to translate the said minutes and study them. However, the said request was"
"refused, and the charges were read out to him immediately despite the objections raised by"
"them. Thereafter, the 3rd respondent re-fixed the inquiry for the 31st of May, 2022."
"Furthermore, the petitioner stated that a stenographer was not present at the inquiry held on the"
"23rd of May, 2022, but the proceedings were video recorded. Later, the transcript of the said"

"that  the  transcript  was  inaccurate  and  distorted.  Further,  it  did  not  reflect  some  of  the"
"proceedings  that  took  place  at  the  said  inquiry.  Hence,  he  requested,  inter  alia,  that  a"
