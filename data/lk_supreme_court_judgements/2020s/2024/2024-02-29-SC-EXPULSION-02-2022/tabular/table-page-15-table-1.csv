"The said document containing the reasons to expel the petitioner was signed by N. M. Shaheid,"
"the 3rd respondent on the 1st of June, 2022 and by S. Suairdeen, the 1st respondent on the 12th"
"of June, 2022."
"Further, the said document appears to have been printed on a computer and thereafter signed"
"twice on two separate dates. However, both signatures cannot appear on the last page if the"
"signatures were placed on the paper on two separated dates; one on the 1st of June, 2022 and"
"the  other  on  the  12th  of  June,  2022.  Moreover,  the  said  discrepancy  cast  a  doubt  on  the"
"authenticity of the document."
"Moreover, the respondents have not produced materials to prove that they have considered the"
"relevant  material  and  taken  a  decision  to  expel  the  petitioner.  Accordingly,  I  hold  that  the"
"expulsion of the petitioner is invalid."
