Facts of the application

The petitioner is a member of Parliament elected from the Digamadulla District at the General

Election in August, 2020 from the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (hereinafter referred to as the

ACMC).

The petitioner stated that he was expelled from the party on the allegation that he voted for the

2nd and 3rd reading of the Budget 2022 in defiance of the party decision not to vote for the said

Budget. He stated that the said decision to expel him from the party is unlawful and violates

the principles of natural justice as he was not given an opportunity to Show Cause in respect

of the charges levelled against him and a proper disciplinary inquiry was not held prior to

expelling him.

The petitioner further stated that on the 29th of November, 2021, he received a Show Cause

Notice dated 26th of November, 2021 from the 1st respondent stating that as he had voted for

the Budget 2022 against the decision of the ACMC and therefore, disciplinary action would be

taken against him by the Political Authority. Further, it was stated that if no written explanation

5

was sent within 14 days, it would be considered that he has no cause to show and he would be

expelled from the party. Thereafter, on the 8th of December, 2021, he replied to the said letter

stating that he was unaware of the decision referred to in the same letter.

Furthermore, the decision to vote against the Budget 2022 was decided by the Political

Authority at the meeting held on the 21st of November, 2021, when the petitioner was absent.

The petitioner stated that he did not read the WhatsApp messages, nor the other forms of

communication alleged to have been sent to him by the Political Authority informing him not

to vote for the Budget 2022. Hence, he was not aware of the said decision.

The petitioner stated that he and the 1st respondent exchanged several letters, consequent to

which, a purported inquiry was scheduled to be held on the 23rd of May, 2022. The petitioner

also stated that the purported Disciplinary Committee of the party has no jurisdiction to make

a decision to expel him from the party. In any event, he informed the 1st respondent that the

allegations levelled against him were baseless, and that he was not aware of any decision to

vote against the Budget. He further stated that he requested for the minutes of the meetings of

the Political Authority held on 21st of November, 2021, 22nd of November, 2021, and 12th of

March, 2022 in order to get ready with disciplinary inquiry.

He further stated that on the 23rd of May, 2022, he attended the inquiry with his lawyers and

requested that the minutes of the said meetings be handed over to them prior to the reading of

the charges. Accordingly, the minutes of said meetings were handed over at the inquiry.

However, those minutes were in the Tamil language and his lawyer could not read them as he

was not conversant in the Tamil language. Hence, the counsel for the petitioner requested for

additional time to translate the said minutes and study them. However, the said request was

refused, and the charges were read out to him immediately despite the objections raised by

them. Thereafter, the 3rd respondent re-fixed the inquiry for the 31st of May, 2022.

Furthermore, the petitioner stated that a stenographer was not present at the inquiry held on the

23rd of May, 2022, but the proceedings were video recorded. Later, the transcript of the said

proceedings was emailed to the petitioners Attorney-at-Law. However, the petitioner stated

that the transcript was inaccurate and distorted. Further, it did not reflect some of the

proceedings that took place at the said inquiry. Hence, he requested, inter alia, that a

stenographer be arranged for the next date of inquiry and that a copy of the videotaped

6

proceedings of the meeting be handed over in order to correct the transcript of the proceedings

held on the 23rd of May, 2022.

Moreover, two other members of the party, Ali Sabry Raheem and Ishak Rahuman, facing

inquiries on similar charges, were represented by the same counsel. Similar to the petitioner,

their inquiries were held initially on the 23rd of May, 2022 and then postponed for the 31st of

May, 2022.

The petitioner stated that at the inquiry held on the 31st of May, 2022, the petitioners counsel

commenced submissions and raised several preliminary objections. The counsel further stated

in his objections that the Disciplinary Committee has no jurisdiction to expel the petitioner.

Moreover, the said Disciplinary Committee comprised of the Political Authority. In that

capacity, they had not only framed the charges and issued the Charge Sheet to the petitioner,

but they were also holding the inquiry and would make the final determination on the said

charges. However, halfway through the proceedings, the 3rd respondent terminated the

proceedings without making a ruling on the said preliminary objections and informed that the

Political Authority will communicate the final decision to the petitioner later.

Subsequently, on the 1st of June, 2022, the petitioner was informed via WhatsApp that he was

expelled from the party. Further, on the 14th of June, 2022, a document containing the purported

reasons for the decision to expel him from the Party was sent to him.

It was further stated that no disciplinary action was taken against the other two Members of

Parliament who voted for the 2nd and 3rd reading of the Budget 2022. Thus, the petitioner stated

that the 1st to 26th respondents were biased and acted with mala fides against him.

The petitioner stated that in the circumstances, the respondents violated his right to be heard

and to face a proper disciplinary inquiry before he was expelled from the party. Further, the

petitioner stated that the said disciplinary inquiry was not held according to the principles of

natural justice and the Constitution of the ACMC. In the circumstances, the petitioner stated

that his expulsion from the party was unlawful, void ab initio and without force or effect in

law. Furthermore, the decision to expel him from the party was unreasonable, irrational and

capricious.

7

Objections of the 1st to 7th, the 9th to 18th, the 19th, 20th, 22nd to the 25th and the 27th

respondents

The respondents filed objections and stated that during the campaign for the 2020 general

election, the ACMC heavily campaigned against the policies of the Sri Lanka Podujana

Peramuna (SLPP). As a party member, the petitioner was expected to act in accordance with

the mandate received by the ACMC and the policies which they campaigned for at the said

election.

Further, on the 14th of November, 2021, the petitioner was notified that an important meeting

of the party was to be held on the 21st of November, 2021. However, on the 20th of November,

2021, the petitioner informed that he will not be able to attend the meeting due to impromptu

matters of grave urgency. Thereafter, on the 21st of November, 2021, the meeting was held,

and it was unanimously decided to vote against the Budget 2022.

Hence, by letter dated 21st of November, 2021, the political authority informed the petitioner

of the said party decision. The said letter was delivered by hand to the petitioner by the 8th

respondent, prior to the vote on the Second Reading of the Budget. However, acting contrary

to the decision of the ACMC, on the 22nd of November, 2021, the petitioner voted in favour of

the Budget 2022 at the Second Reading of the Budget.

The respondents further stated that the petitioner acted against the best interests of the country

and against the best interests of the ACMC by voting for the Budget against the said decision

of the party. Moreover, the petitioner acted in his personal interests by voting in favour of the

said Budget.

The respondents stated that in an interview published in a Tamil language newspaper on 19th

of November, 2021, the petitioner had stated that those who love the country cannot oppose

the Budget 2022. He further justified his support for the Budget 2022 and criticised the

opposing parties.

It was further stated that on the 26th of November, 2021, the Political Authority issued a Show

Cause Notice requesting a written explanation from the petitioner with regard to his voting in

favour of the Budget 2022 at the Second Reading. However, by letter dated 8th of December,

2021, the petitioner informed that he was unaware of the aforesaid decision of the Political

Authority and sought further time to respond to the said Show Cause Notice.

8

Thereafter, prior to the Third Reading of the Budget, by letter dated 3rd December, 2021, the

petitioner was informed not to vote for the Budget at its Third Reading. However, the petitioner

voted in favour of the Budget 2022 at the Third Reading on the 10th of December, 2021.

It was further stated that the petitioner at no time, either prior to the Second Reading of the

Budget 2022 or the Third Reading, expressed any view to the ACMC that he or the Party should

vote in favour of the Budget.

In the circumstances, on the 25th of April, 2022, the petitioner was informed that he has not

shown sufficient cause, and as such, it was decided to hold a disciplinary inquiry against him

on the 23rd of May, 2022.

Moreover, the respondents stated that on the 23rd of May, 2022 at the inquiry, as requested, the

petitioner was furnished with the copies of the minutes of the meetings of 21st of November,

2021, 22nd of November, 2021, and 12th of March 2022. However, the petitioner did not inform

the Disciplinary Committee that he would be represented by lawyers and an English translation

of the said minutes were not requested. Hence, the said minutes of meetings were provided in

Tamil as the political party conducts its proceedings and keeps the minutes of its meetings in

Tamil. Moreover, as the petitioner understands Tamil, the Disciplinary Committee provided

extra 15 minutes to the petitioner to discuss the minutes with his counsel.

Furthermore, it was stated that the Charge Sheet in Sinhala, Tamil and English languages were

handed over to the petitioner at the inquiry. Thereafter, the charges were read out at the inquiry,

but the petitioner did not plead to the charges. Nevertheless, at the request of counsel for the

petitioner, a further date was granted and the inquiry was adjourned to the 31st of May, 2022.

The respondents stated that as per the petitioners request, a stenographer was made available

at the proceedings held on the 31st of May, 2022. However, at the inquiry, the counsel for the

petitioner stated that the transcripts of proceedings held on the 23rd of May, 2022 were

inaccurate and requested for the video recordings of the said inquiry. The 3rd respondent

rejected the said request and asked the petitioner to plead for the charges and continue with the

proceedings. Further, the 3rd respondent offered to read out the charges again on the 31st of

May, 2022. However, the petitioner did not agree for it.

Moreover, the counsel for the petitioner raised objections alleging that the members of the

Political Authority were not in fact members of the Political Authority. However, the

9

respondents stated that the petitioner having participated at the meetings of the party as an ex

officio member of the Political Authority along with the 1st to 26th respondents, he was estopped

from disputing the composition of the Political Authority. Thus, it was stated that the petitioner

cannot now request the respondents to furnish details as to the validity of their appointments.

It was further stated that the petitioners contention that he did not know the composition of

the Political Authority is false.

Furthermore, the respondents stated that the disciplinary inquiry was conducted in accordance

with the Constitution of the Party and was not contrary to the principles of natural justice.

Moreover, the 3rd respondent terminated the disciplinary inquiry proceedings stating that the

petitioner was not cooperating. Further, he stated that the petitioner does not want to plead to

the Charge Sheet and make his defense. Moreover, the 3rd respondent stated that the petitioner

was raising various technical objections with the intention of delaying the proceedings. Hence,

the petitioner was informed that the Political Authority will take a decision and communicate

it to him.

Thereafter, the petitioner was informed of the final decision of the party by letter dated 1st of

June, 2022. The petitioner was also provided with the reasons for the decision by the document

delivered on the 14th of June, 2022. Furthermore, it was stated that the expulsion of the

petitioner was lawful and justified. The respondents stated that the application of the petitioner

is misconceived in fact and law and that the petitioner is not entitled to maintain the instant

application or to obtain the relief prayed for.

Allegation of suppression and misrepresentation of facts by the petitioner

The respondents stated that the decision to vote against the Budget 2022 was taken at the

Political Authority meeting of the ACMC on the 21st of November, 2021, in which the

petitioner was absent. The said decision was communicated to the petitioner by email and SMS

on the 21st of November, 2021. However, the said materials were not produced by the petitioner

along with his application. Further, the petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation

as the petitioner denied the knowledge of the decision of the party to vote against the Budget

for the year 2022, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner was informed several times of the

said decision. Hence, the instant application should be dismissed in limine.

10

Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution states;

Where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or

otherwise, to be a member of a recognized political party or independent

group on whose nomination paper (hereinafter referred to as the relevant

nomination paper) his name appeared at the time of his becoming such

Member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a

period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member:

Provided that in the case of the expulsion of a Member of Parliament his seat

shall not become vacant if prior to the expiration of the said period of one

month he applies to the Supreme Court by petition in writing, and the

Supreme Court upon such application determines that such expulsion was

invalid. Such petition shall be inquired into by three Judges of the Supreme

Court who shall make their determination within two months of the filing of

such petition. Where the Supreme Court determines that the expulsion was

valid the vacancy shall occur from the date of such determination.

[emphasis added]

The jurisdiction of this court under Article 99 (13)(a) of the Constitution is sui generis, original

and exclusive. Further, an application filed under the said Article 99 (13)(a) of the Constitution

acts as a right of appeal provided to a Member of Parliament who was expelled from a Party.

Therefore, such an application should not be dismissed in limine without considering the merits

of the application.

A similar view was expressed in Peramulli Hewa Pivasena v. ITAK SC Special (Expulsion)

3/2010 at pages 6, 7, where Justice Marsoof held;

The jurisdiction of this Court conferred by Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution

is sui generis, original and exclusive, and does not confer any discretion to this

Court to dismiss in limine an application filed there under merely on the ground

of suppression or misrepresentation of material facts, as in cases involving

injunctive relief or applications for prerogative writs.

.

.

11

I am therefore of the opinion that even in a case where there is cogent evidence

to establish that an expelled Member of Parliament did not come to Court with

clean hands, if this Court finds that the purported expulsion is invalid, "his seat

shall not become vacant" and he will continue to hold office, and this Court does

not have the discretion to make a contrary determination on the sole ground

of suppression misrepresentation of material facts, or dismiss the application

in limine. I am of the opinion that it is therefore not necessary to make any

findings in regard to the question whether the Petitioner has suppressed or

misrepresented any material facts in his Petition or in the course of the hearing,

and accordingly, the preliminary objection raised by the 3rd Respondent has to

be overruled.

[emphasis added]

In view of the above, the application of the respondents to reject/dismiss the instant application

of the petitioner on the alleged suppression and misrepresentation of facts is overruled.

Were the principles of Natural Justice adhered to at the disciplinary inquiry?

Members of the Parliament exercise the sovereignty of the People. Further, they represent the

voters/people in the country in Parliament. However, if a Member of Parliament is expelled

from the party, he will lose his seat in Parliament. Hence it is imperative to hold a proper

disciplinary inquiry before a decision is taken to expel a member from a political party.

Furthermore, it is necessary to give a fair hearing to the member at the disciplinary inquiry.

Further, it does not matter that the outcome of the inquiry may be obvious or may not be

different. In the circumstances, it is essential that the petitioner was given a fair hearing to

justify his actions before being expelled from the party or being subjected to any other

punishment by the political party.

A similar view was expressed in Tissa Attanayake v. United National Party and Others (2015)

1 SLR 319 at page 331 where it was held;

Admittedly, the opportunity of a fair hearing mas be limited in the circumstances.

For instance, the time for responding to a charge sheet or making submissions

may be reduced. Yet, the person is entitled to be told what he is charged with and

12

afforded some opportunity of explaining himself. The Petitioner is a Member of

Parliament and expulsion could lead to lose his seat. The very gravity of the

matter required that at least a limited hearing ought to be given to the

Petitioner.

[emphasis added]

Similarly, in General Medical Council v. Spackman (1943) AC 627 at page 644 it was held;

If the principles of natural justice are violated in respect of any decision, it is,

indeed, immaterial whether the same decision would have been arrived at in

the absence of the departure from the essential principles of justice. The

decision must be declared to be no decision

However, at the inquiry under consideration, the petitioner was not given an opportunity to

present his case. Only preliminary objections raised on his behalf were heard at the said inquiry.

However, no decision was made in respect of the preliminary objections raised by the

petitioner. Further, a Charge Sheet was issued to the petitioner and the charges were read at the

inquiry. Thereafter, the proceedings were terminated abruptly.

The disciplinary inquiry proceedings marked as IR15 by the respondents contain the

following statement made by the 3rd respondent, the Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry

panel;

The Political Authority is of the opinion that the Hon. Member though given an

opportunity does not want to plead to the Charge Sheet and make his defense. At

this stage he is trying to make various objections with the deliberate intention of

delaying these proceedings, which the Political Authority is not prepared to

accommodate. In the circumstances, I would like to inform the Member since he

has not cooperated and his attitude and his representatives who made submissions

before this Political Authority, do not in any way could be justifiably

accommodated. In the circumstances the Political Authority will retire and make

a decision, a final decision of the Political Authority.

The failure to proceed with the disciplinary inquiry deprived the petitioner of explaining his

actions at the disciplinary inquiry. Thus, it violates the principle of natural justice i.e., audi

alteram partem.

13

In Tissa Attanayake v. United National Party and Others (supra) at page 334, a similar view

was expressed. i.e.;

the observance of natural justice depicted in the maxim Audi Alteram

Partem provides the foundation for the manner and form in which

Administrative Law is applied. Whether or not the other party has reasons or

defences to submit is not the issue. The basic issue is to provide the other party

an opportunity to explain himself.

Moreover, no evidence was led at the inquiry to establish the charges levelled against the

petitioner. Thus, the decision to expel the petitioner from the party is not based on the evidence

led at the disciplinary inquiry and therefore, the said decision to expel the petitioner is arbitrary

and capricious.

Was the decision to expel the petitioner valid in law?

By the letter dated 1st of June, 2022, (marked and produced as P10), the petitioner was

informed that a decision has been taken to expel him from the party by the Political Authority

at the meeting held on the 31st of May, 2022. The said letter, inter alia, states;

This is further to the disciplinary inquiry held against you on May 23rd, 2022

and May 31st, 2022.

I write to inform you that the Political Authority of the All Ceylon Makkal

Congress at its meeting held on May 31st, 2022 has decided to expel you from

the party and you shall forthwith cease to be a member of the party. As such, you

are requested not to hold out or claim that you are a Member of the All Ceylon

Makkal Congress hereinafter.

A written report with reasons will be sent to you during the course of this week.

[emphasis added]

However, the final page of the document which contained the reasons to expel the petitioner,

which was marked and produced as P11 stated;

14

At the meeting of the Political Authority held on June 01st, 2022 all members

present agreed that Hon Mr Muszhaaraff ought to be expelled from the Party.

All members present except Mr Hussain Bhaila also approved this order. Mr

Bhaila requested further time to consider the same and convey his position. He

conveyed his consent to this order on June 11th, 2022.

[emphasis added]

The aforementioned vital discrepancy in the dates which refers to the purported expulsion of

the petitioner prevents considering the contents of the said documents as it not clear whether

in fact, a decision was taken by the Political Authority to expel the petitioner. Furthermore, the

respondents did not produce the minutes of the meeting which is alleged to have taken the

decision to expel the petitioner from the party. Thus, it is uncertain whether a meeting to expel

the petitioner had ever taken place.

A similar view was expressed in Ameer Ali and Others v. Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and

Others (2006) 1 SLR 189 at pages 198, 200 where it was held;

Since the final decision to expel the Petitioners is said to have been made at

this meeting it was essential for the Respondents to have produced the

minutes of the meeting that indicate the persons who were present and the

manner in which the serious issues raised by the Petitioners were

considered before a final decision was made.

The burden of proof is on the Respondents to satisfy the Court as to the

competence of the expelling authority, being in this instance the High

Command of the Party. To get to this point it is the burden of the Respondents

to establish that the validly constituted High Command convened and took the

decision reflected in the several letters written by the General Secretary. At

the least, the Respondents should have produced the book containing

minutes of the meeting of the High Command that include the minutes of

the relevant meetings. They have failed to produce even such prima facie

evidence of the meetings. It is also the burden of the Respondents to satisfy

this Court that the High Command considered the evidence and the relevant

15

material in respect of the charges that have been made against the

Petitioners in the light of the matters urged by the Petitioners (in their reply

to the show cause notice) and came to findings adverse to petitioners from the

perspective of the overall interests of the Party and its electorate.

[emphasis added]

Moreover, the petitioner was informed by letter dated 1st of June, 2022 that the Political

Authority had decided to expel him from the Party. Thereafter, the petitioner was provided with

the reasons for the decision to expel him by the document delivered on the 14th of June, 2022.

The said document containing the reasons to expel the petitioner was signed by N. M. Shaheid,

the 3rd respondent on the 1st of June, 2022 and by S. Suairdeen, the 1st respondent on the 12th

of June, 2022.

Further, the said document appears to have been printed on a computer and thereafter signed

twice on two separate dates. However, both signatures cannot appear on the last page if the

signatures were placed on the paper on two separated dates; one on the 1st of June, 2022 and

the other on the 12th of June, 2022. Moreover, the said discrepancy cast a doubt on the

authenticity of the document.

Moreover, the respondents have not produced materials to prove that they have considered the

relevant material and taken a decision to expel the petitioner. Accordingly, I hold that the

expulsion of the petitioner is invalid.
