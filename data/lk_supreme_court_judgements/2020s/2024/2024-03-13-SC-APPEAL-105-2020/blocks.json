The first and the second Respondents-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) objected to the winding up application on the basis that this winding up application is an attempt to deny the creditors of the Petitioner of their dues. Upon inquiry, the learned High Court Judge of the Commercial High Court of Colombo by his order dated 30.08.2019 dismissed the application of the Petitioner for winding up of the Company. Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned High Court Judge, the Petitioner preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

At the hearing of the appeal, the Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the learned High Court Judge in the impugned order has come to the conclusion that the Petitioner has failed to comply with the mandatory requirements mentioned in section 319 of the Act and therefore the entire process is tainted with illegality. It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that, section 319 of the Act is relevant to voluntary winding up of a Company, and that it has no application to this case as this is an application for winding up with the assistance by Court. 4. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner further contended that the shareholders of the Company have passed a special resolution that the Company be wound by Court and therefore that is sufficient for the Court to make an order to wind up the Company. It is the position of the learned Counsel that, the grounds (a) to (f) in section 270 of the Act are alternative grounds and therefore, the basis of the resolution being passed by the Company as per section 270(a) of the Act, is in itself sufficient for the Court to make the order for winding up. 5. At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the resolution passed by the Company [P-6] was passed on the basis of the audited financial statement [P-4], hence, it is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that the Petitioner has failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the Petitioner is unable to pay the debts. The learned Counsel further contended that, no material was placed before Court to enable the Court to form such opinion. 6. This winding up application of the Petitioner has been made consequent to the special resolution [P-6] resolved by the shareholders of the Petitioner Company on 31st October 2018, in terms of Section 270 (a) of the Act. [P-6] was passed on the basis of the auditors report marked [P-4] dated 30th October",

On the same day, the shareholders who were also the directors of the Petitioner Company have passed the resolution.

The special resolution [P-6] clearly states that as per the auditors report the Company is unable to pay the debts as they fall due and therefore the Company be wound up by Court in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Thus, it is clear that this winding up application was made in terms of Section 270 (d) of the Act as the Company is unable to pay its debts and the resolution has been passed on that basis. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Petitioner to prove to the satisfaction of the Court, the inability of the Petitioner to pay its debts as defined in Section 271 of the Act.",

The learned High Court Judge has correctly concluded that the Petitioner has not annexed the audited accounts or has not set out the contingent or prospective liabilities of the Petitioner.
