"","above  premise, 
the  question  of 
law 
(1) 
is  answered 
in 
the"
"","negative."
"14.","Although it is not necessary to discuss the questions of law (2)"
"","and  (3),  as  per  the  above  reasoning  and  the  answer  given  to"
"","question of law No. (1), for the sake of completeness I will resort"
"","to discuss them."
"15.","The learned High Court Judge in his judgment has said that the"
"","Petitioner Company has failed to comply with the requirements"
"","provided in sections 319 and 320 of the Act, thereby the entire"
"","winding up process is tainted with illegality."
"16.","The Act provides for winding up by Court, the relevant sections"
"","commence  with  section  270  of  the  Act.  This  application  was"
"","made clearly in terms of  section 270  of the Act  for the  winding"
"","up  of  the  Company  by  Court.  That  is  why  the  application  was"
"","filed  in  Court  and  moved  to  follow  the  procedure  laid  down  for"
"","Court assisted winding up."
"17.","Sections  commencing  from  section  319  of  the  Act  provides  for"
"","voluntary  winding  up.  As  it  is  not  assisted  by  Court,  certain"
"","additional 
safeguards 
such 
as 
the 
requirement 
that 
the"
"","resolution  passed  be  published 
in 
the  Government  Gazette"
"","within fourteen days, are provided. In terms of section 320, the"
"","Company and every officer of the Company who fails to comply"
"","with the said provision shall be guilty of an offence."
"18.","Such 
requirement 
to 
give 
notice 
by 
publication 
in 
the"
"","Government  Gazette  is  not  provided  for  applications  for  Court"
"","assisted  winding  up.  Therefore,  sections  319  and  320  has  no"
"","application to the instant case."
"19.","While  questions  of  law  No.  (2)  and  (3)  will  be  answered  in  the"
"","affirmative,  I  must  state  that  no  prejudice  has  been  caused  to"
"","the  appellant  by  the  said  findings  of  the  High  Court  as  the"
"","learned Judge of the High Court has considered the application"
"","on its merits."
