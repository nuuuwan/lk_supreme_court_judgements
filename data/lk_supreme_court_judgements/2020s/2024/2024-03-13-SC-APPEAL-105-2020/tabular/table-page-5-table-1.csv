"","the Companies Act which is entirely inapplicable to"
"","a winding up by Court?"
"3.","At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"","submitted  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  the  impugned"
"","order  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed"
"","to  comply  with 
the  mandatory 
requirements  mentioned 
in"
"","section 319 of the Act and therefore the entire process is tainted"
"","with illegality. It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the"
"","Petitioner  that,  section  319  of  the  Act  is  relevant  to  voluntary"
"","winding up of a Company, and that it has no application to this"
"","case as this is an application for winding up with the assistance"
"","by Court."
"4
.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  further  contended  that"
"","the 
shareholders  of 
the  Company  have  passed  a 
special"
"","resolution  that  the  Company  be  wound  by  Court  and  therefore"
"","that is sufficient for the Court to make an order to wind up the"
"","Company.  It  is  the  position  of  the  learned  Counsel  that,  the"
"","grounds 
(a)  to 
(f) 
in  section  270  of  the  Act  are  alternative"
"","grounds and therefore, the basis of the resolution being passed"
"","by  the  Company  as  per  section  270(a)  of  the  Act,  is  in  itself"
"","sufficient for the Court to make the order for winding up."
"5.","At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal, 
the 
learned  Counsel 
for  the"
"","Respondents  submitted 
that 
the 
resolution  passed  by 
the"
"","Company [P-6] was passed on the basis of the audited financial"
"","statement 
[P-4],  hence, 
it 
is  the  submission  of  the 
learned"
"","Counsel  for  the  Respondents  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"","prove  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  that  the  Petitioner 
is"
"","unable to pay the debts. The learned Counsel further contended"
"","that, no material was placed before Court to enable the Court to"
"","form such opinion."
"6.","This  winding  up  application  of  the  Petitioner  has  been  made"
"","consequent 
to 
the  special 
resolution 
[P-6] 
resolved  by 
the"
"","shareholders  of  the  Petitioner  Company  on  31st  October  2018,"
"","in  terms  of  Section  270  (a)  of  the  Act.  [P-6]  was  passed  on  the"
"","basis  of  the  auditorâ€™s  report  marked  [P-4]  dated  30th  October"
