"regarding the complaint made by the 1st petitioner to the Special"
"Investigations Unit (SIU) has been submitted to Court as per the"
"document dated 24.10.2023, signed by Senior Superintendent of"
"Police,  Director  of  Discipline,  K.R.  Nishantha  De  Silva.  The"
"position  of  the  2nd  petitioner  has  been  corroborated  by  the"
"statement 
of 
Police 
Constable 
K.D.  Madhuka 
Nayanjith"
"Gunathunga in the investigation that has been carried out by the"
"SIU. He has stated that he saw the 2nd petitioner with her child"
"at  the  Police  Station.  It  is  admitted  that  a  statement  has  been"
"recorded  by  the  police,  which  has  been  produced  as 
[R-2]."
"However, the 1st respondent in his affidavit does not specify the"
"place 
in  which  the  statement  was  recorded.  The  document"
"marked [R-2] seems to specify that the statement was made at"
"the  residence  of  the  petitioners.  When  considering  the  facts  of"
"this case as a whole, I am inclined to believe the version of the"
"2nd petitioner."
