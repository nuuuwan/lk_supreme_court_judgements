"27.  The petitioners further state that, although the HRC has initiated"
"an  inquiry,  the  1st-4th  respondents  have  failed  to  provide  any"
"explanation to the HRC and are deliberately absconding from the"
"inquiry of the HRC, as they have no justification for the arbitrary"
"acts committed by them."
"28.  The petitioners allege that, the action in case no. 44910 filed in"
"terms  of  sections  344  and  486  of  the  Penal  Code,  read  with"
"Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses"
"Act  that  has  been  filed  against  the  1st  petitioner,  is  a  clear"
"malicious prosecution by the respondents and such actions by"
"the respondents are arbitrary. The petitioners further allege that"
"the B-report no. 44910 marked [P-7] is a belated report as it has"
"been filed three months after the alleged incident."
"29.  The fact that the 1st petitioner uttered the words to the effect that"
"he would take legal action against the officers who were involved"
"in  the  malicious  and  illegal  actions  carried  out  against  him  is"
"admitted. However, the petitioners state that those words do not"
"constitute  an  offence  in  terms  of  sections  344  and  486  of  the"
"Penal Code read with the Assistance to and Protection of Victims"
"of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 04 of 2015. It was further alleged"
"that this action has been instituted in order to incarcerate the 1st"
"petitioner. The petitioners also alleged that the B-report bearing"
"no. 44910 [P-7] has been maliciously filed immediately after the"
"receipt of the JMO’s report [P-4B] and the Government Analyst’s"
"report  [P-4C]  which  cleared  the  1st  petitioner  from  the  case"
"bearing no. 42474."
"30.  The  petitioners  also  take  the  position  that,  the  order  of  the  1st"
"respondent in making the 3rd respondent record the statement of"
"the 1st petitioner relating to a case where the 3rd respondent was"
"the main eyewitness is a grave violation of natural justice."
"T
he Interdiction"
"31.  It was the position of the petitioners that the interdiction of the"
"1st  petitioner  by  the  4th  respondent  constitutes  a  violation  of"
"11"
