"document 
[R-2],  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  1st  and  the  2nd"
"respondents  have  violated  the  rights  guaranteed  to  the  2nd"

he Malicious prosecutions"
"24.  It  was 
the  position  of 
the  petitioners 
that 
the  malicious"
"prosecutions that were carried out against the 1st petitioner by"
"the  respondents  were  a  violation  of  the 
fundamental  rights"
"guaranteed to the 1st petitioner in terms of Articles 12(1), 13(1)"
"and  13(2)  of  the  Constitution.  It  was  also  alleged  that  these"

"when considering the report of the JMO [P-4B] and the report of"
"the Government Analyst [P-4C] which indicated negative for any"
"illicit substance. It was also their position that, the B-report no."

"as a means of exacting revenge from the 1st petitioner  as there"
"existed  an  animosity  between  the  1st  petitioner  and  the  1st-3rd"
"respondents."

"discharged  by 
the  order  of 
the 
learned  Magistrate  dated"

"been ruined as the false news naming the 1st petitioner as a drug"
"addicted  police  constable  has  been  circulated  through  several"
"newspapers and the mainstream media."
