"or decision taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with the prevailing"
"provisions of the scheme of recruitment."
"We observe that the Public Service Commission has made this decision after the Petitioners"
"have filed the instant case. Thus, invariably the said decision to re-introduce the afore-said"
"removed qualification has been taken by the Public Service Commission either because the"
"Petitioners  have  challenged  the  said  decision  before  Court  or  its  own  realisation  of  the"
"inappropriacy of its decision. It is significant to note that the Public Service Commission has"
"changed its mind even before this Court had granted Leave to Proceed to this Petition.  The"
"Public Service Commission is silent as to why they had decided to re-introduce the afore-said"
"removed qualification. The said removal and later on re-introduction of the said qualification"
"at  two  different  times  are  contrary  to  each  other  in  the  absence  of  any  plausible  reason"
"thereto. We observe that the reservation made by the Public Service Commission that the re-"
"introduction of the removed qualification should not apply retrospectively, has no justification"
"at all. The Public Service Commission has not given any reason thereto. Therefore, the decision"
"of  the Public  Service  Commission  to  apply  the  re-introduction  of  the  said  qualification  only"
"prospectively without prejudice to any action or decision taken by it earlier is arbitrary and"
"therefore should not have any force in law."
