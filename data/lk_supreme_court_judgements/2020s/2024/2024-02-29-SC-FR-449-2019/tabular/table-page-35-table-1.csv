"The concept of “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” (“Who will guard the guards themselves?”),"
"would apply where the executive who acts as the custodian of the People’s power would abuse"
"that  power  for  personal  benefits  and  not  face  any  repercussions  by  the  other  branches  of"
"governance.  Accordingly,  the  securing  of  personal  benefits  and  advantages  for  himself  by"
"presiding  over  the  Cabinet  while  still  in  power  as  the  sitting  President  is  a  breach  of  the"
"provisions  of  the  Presidents  Entitlements Act  No.  4  of  1986,  as  it  is  intended  for  former"
"Presidents."
"Moreover, as stated prior, the aforementioned impugned decision of the Cabinet of Ministers"
"violates the general principle of natural justice."
"In the circumstances, I hold that the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers dated 15th of"
"October, 2019, provided the 1A respondent with entitlements beyond the scope offered by the"
"Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986. Further, the said decision is arbitrary, unreasonable,"
"ultra vires, illegal and amounts to a violation of the Rule of Law and the Fundamental Rights"
"guaranteed to the petitioners and citizens of Sri Lanka under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Accordingly, the application is allowed, and I quash the aforementioned decision of the Cabinet"
"of Ministers dated 15th of October, 2019 (marked and produced as ‘P12’)."
"No costs."
