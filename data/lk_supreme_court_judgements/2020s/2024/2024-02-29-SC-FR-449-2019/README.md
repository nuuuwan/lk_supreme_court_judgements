Dr. Avanti Perera, DSG for the 2nd, 32B and 33B Respondents.

Argued on : 14th September, 2022

Decided on : 29th February, 2024

20

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

The petitioners filed the instant application challenging the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers

to grant the former President, the 1A respondent, to occupy his official residence after his

retirement under the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986.

Facts of the case

The instant application was initially filed against the Attorney General in terms of Article 35(1)

of the Constitution, alleging the infringement of Fundamental Rights of the petitioners and

citizens of Sri Lanka. Upon the retirement of the former President, he was added as the 1A

respondent to the application.

The petitioners stated that the Minister of Finance, by a Cabinet Memorandum dated 11th of

October, 2019 recommended, inter alia, to allocate the residence that he was occupying as the

President, which is situated at Mahagama Sekara Mawatha (Paget Road), Colombo 7 to be

given to the 1A respondent after his retirement in terms of section 2 of the Presidents

Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986.

The petitioners further stated that in terms of Article 43(2) of the Constitution, when the

Cabinet Memorandum regarding his retirement benefits was discussed and decided, the 1A

respondent as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers presided over the said meeting. Hence, it

was stated that the participation of the 1A respondent in the said Cabinet meeting is a violation

of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua / conflict of interest and is demonstrative of the

mala fides of the 1A respondent.

Moreover, the petitioners stated that though the former President is entitled to certain benefits

under and in terms of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986, the said power should be

exercised according to the law and in a reasonable manner.

The petitioners further stated that the aforementioned residence occupied by the 1A respondent

is of great financial value and is an asset of the country. Moreover, in October 2015,

approximately Rs. 180 million was allocated from State funds for the renovation of the said

residence and to merge two houses stating to bring into proper condition which is suitable for

the use of the President. Hence, the petitioners stated that an allocation of a public asset used

21

by the President, which is of a high financial value, for the personal use of a former President

is irrational, unreasonable, arbitrary, ultra vires and illegal.

It was further stated that the decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers goes beyond the scope

of the said Act and violates the right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed to

the citizens of this country by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

After hearing the parties, the Supreme Court granted Special Leave to proceed with the instant

application and an interim Order was made suspending the operation of the said Cabinet

decision dated 15th of October, 2019. Hence, the 1A respondent vacated the premises in

compliance with said interim Order.

Submissions of the petitioners

The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 1A respondent was the former

President and the head of the Cabinet of Ministers in terms of Article 43(2) of the Constitution

at the time the Cabinet made the impugned decision with regard to his retirement benefits.

Further, at the time the said decision was taken, the 1A respondent had participated in the said

meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers.

The learned counsel for the petitioners cited Senarath and others v. Chandrika

Bandaranayake Kumaratunga and others (2007) 1 SLR 59 and submitted that according to

the principle of nemo judex in causa sua, a person should refrain from participating in taking

decisions in respect of himself.

In the circumstances, the learned counsel further submitted that the 1A respondent chaired the

meeting in which it was decided to grant him retirement benefits and hence, the said decision

is a violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua. Moreover, the said Act does not

provide for the granting of a residence fit for a President to be given to a former President.

Further, the Cabinet of Ministers cannot decide the entitlements that should be granted to the

President upon retirement when he is holding office. Moreover, the President is constitutionally

vested with the power to remove any Cabinet Minister or their functions and thus, exercises

full control over the Ministers. Hence, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

22

taking such a decision while the President is holding office would lead to a conflict of interest,

which would result in an abuse of power.

It was further submitted that granting retirement benefits above and beyond the scope of

Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 is a violation of the doctrine of equality enshrined

in Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the decisions to grant entitlements

to former Presidents are not policy decisions, but are decisions taken during the normal course

of the business of the Cabinet of Ministers.

Submissions of the 1A respondent

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1A respondent submitted that the 1A respondent is the

former President of Sri Lanka and is entitled to certain benefits under Presidents Entitlements

Act No. 4 of 1986. Accordingly, the former President is entitled to receive a residence under

the said Act. As such, the Minister of Finance submitted a Cabinet Memorandum

recommending, inter alia, to allocate the residence situated at Paget Road, used by the 1A

respondent as his official residence, to be used as his residence after the cessation of his tenure.

The said Memorandum was unanimously approved by the Cabinet of Ministers headed by the

1A respondent.

The learned Presidents Counsel further submitted that the instant application does not come

within the jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 17 read with Article 126

of the Constitution as the Cabinet of Ministers are collectively responsible and are directly

answerable to the Parliament. Accordingly, the legality of any Cabinet decision shall be

reviewed and corrected only by Parliament and not by court. Therefore, the court cannot review

the impugned decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 15th of October, 2019.

In this regard, he cited Article 43(1) of the Constitution which states;

"There shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of

the Government of the Republic, which shall be collectively responsible and

answerable to Parliament.

23

In support of the above submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel cited the judgment

delivered in Tilwin Silva v. Ranil Wickremasinge and others (2007) 2 SLR 15, where it was

held;

The Cabinet which consists of the President - Head of the Cabinet, the Prime

Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers is in charge of the direction and control of

the Government and they are collectively responsible to Parliament (Article 43

(1)). When these provisions are considered, in the light of the concept of

collective responsibility of the Cabinet the President and the Cabinet are part of

one unit that is collectively responsible.

The deliberation within the Cabinet amongst its members including the

President, is a matter for the concern of the Cabinet and not of this Court.

It was further submitted that section 2 of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 states;

There shall be provided for every Former President and the widow of a Former

President, during his or her lifetime, the use of an appropriate residence free of

rent.

Accordingly, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that in terms of the said section, the

former President is entitled to receive a suitable residence upon ceasing to hold office as the

President of Sri Lanka. Thus, the decision made on the 15th of October, 2019 by the Cabinet of

Ministers were done in conformity with the provisions of the said Act. Hence, it was submitted

that the allocation of the residence at Mahagama Sekara Mawatha to the 1A respondent is in

conformity with the provisions of the said Act and lawful.

Moreover, it was submitted that the said Act does not provide for a procedure for the allocation

of retirement benefits, and, in particular, does not specify details in relation to the allocation of

a residence to a former President.

Furthermore, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the said residence should be

considered as an appropriate residence for the 1A respondent to reside upon ceasing his office

as the 1A respondent occupied the said residence as his official residence during his entire

tenure.

24

The learned Presidents Counsel further submitted that the 1A respondent is the head of the

Cabinet of Ministers and as such, any meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers has to be headed by

the President. Thus, a Cabinet decision cannot be taken without the participation of the head of

the Cabinet. In the circumstances, the petitioners statement that the 1A respondent has acted

in violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua is baseless. Additionally, as the former

President was acting in terms of the Constitution, it is not possible to state that he acted ultra

vires.

In this regard, the attention of court was drawn to Article 43(2) of the Constitution which reads;

The President shall be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers and shall be

the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers.

Moreover, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the petitioners relied on the decision

of the Supreme Court judgment in Senarath and others v. Chandrika Bandaranayake

Kumaratunga and others (supra) to show that the petitioners rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed. However, the facts of the two cases were

different as in the case of Chandrika Bandaranayake, the ex-President was using her residence

as an office after retirement, together with a large staff, whereas the Act does not provide for a

grant of an office to a former President.

The learned Presidents Counsel also pointed out that the sum of monies allocated as retirement

benefits for the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and 1A respondent are in identical

amounts.

Furthermore, it was submitted that the house under reference is not in a good condition and the

petitioners were overstating its value. Moreover, Parliament had approved the allocation for

the said house to be used by the 1A respondent. In this regard, the attention of court was drawn

to the budget extracts from the Ministry of Finance website depicting the allocation of finances

approved for the upkeep of the said residence.

Hence, it was submitted that the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 is an exception to

the concept of equality before the law and therefore, the Cabinet decision dated 15th of October,

2019 does not amount to a violation of the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution and accordingly, the application should be dismissed.

25

Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to entertain the petitioners application?

The 1A respondent was residing at the home under consideration situated at Mahagama Sekera

Mawatha, Colombo 7 since 2015, after he was elected as the President. Further, he carried out

his official duties as President from the said residence. On the 11th of October, 2019, a Cabinet

Memorandum titled Facilities for former Presidents was presented by the Minister of Finance

to the Cabinet of Ministers to grant retirement benefits to the 1A respondent.

The said Cabinet Memorandum (marked and produced as P11) stated;

1.0 Introduction

1.1 As His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena intends to retire as the Sixth

Executive President of Sri Lanka following the forthcoming Presidential

Elections, this Cabinet Memorandum is presented for the purpose of

providing His Excellency with entitlements of Former Presidents, as well

as special facilities granted to Former Presidents by the Government taking

into consideration special circumstances.

1.2 The Presidential Entitlements Act No 4 of 1986 and Supreme Court

Application No. 503/2005 (FR) mentions the facilities provided to Former

Presidents. Notwithstanding these facts, Government has taken measures to

provide special facilities to Former Presidents owing to special situations

that have occurred during the tenure of presidency.

1.3 The island-wide drug eradication campaign launched by His Excellency

the President to bring drug smugglers, who are subjecting Sri Lanka to a

grave danger, before the law has resulted in a situation where drug dealers

with powerful national and international links pose a threat to the life of

His Excellency. This threat has widened with the action taken by His

Excellency as the Minister of Defence to combat terrorist and extremist

activities.

26

2.0 Proposal

I propose the following facilities to be provided to His Excellency the

President upon his retirement:

i. Provide the services of the Special Task Force for the protection of

His Excellency the President in view of matters mentioned at 1.3

above.

ii. Take measures for the continuous use of His Excellency the

President's official residence at No. 61 Mahagamasekera Mawatha,

Colombo 7, after his retirement.

iii. Provide facilities provided at present to retired presidents, i.e official

and other vehicles and commensurate fuel.

iv. Payment of water, electricity and telephone bills for the official

residence and other facilities related to the official residence.

v. Provide two KKS to facilitate the work of His Excellency the

President.

[emphasis added]

The said Cabinet Memorandum was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers headed by the 1A

respondent on the 15th of October, 2019, to grant the residence situated at Mahagama Sekera

Mawatha, Colombo 7 to the 1A respondent after his retirement as the President in terms of

section 2 of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986.

The decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers regarding the aforementioned Cabinet

Memorandum (marked and produced as P12) stated;

Cabinet Paper No.19/2946/108/239, a Memorandum dated 2019-10-11

by the Minister of Finance on "Facilities for former Presidents" the above

Memorandum was considered by the Cabinet along with the further

clarifications made by the Minister of Finance at this meeting. After

discussion, it was decided to grant approval to the proposals in paragraph

2.0 of the Memorandum.

27

It was also decided to treat this decision as confirmed and to authorize the

Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers to convey the same to the relevant

authorities for necessary action accordingly.

A careful consideration of the said decision and the provisions of the said Act shows that it was

not a policy decision of the Cabinet of Ministers but a decision to provide benefits under the

said Act to the 1A respondent, made by the Cabinet of Ministers in their ordinary course of

business.

Nevertheless, even if the impugned decision was to be considered as a policy decision, the

courts have the power to consider such a decision if the decision is arbitrary and ultra vires.

A similar view was expressed in Sidheswar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. v. Union of India

(2005) 3 SCC 369 where it was held;

Normally the Court should not interfere in policy matter which is within the

purview of the government unless it is shown to be contrary to law or

inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

Further, in Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. v. Delhi Administration and others (2001) 3 SCC 635, the

Indian Supreme Court observed;

It is well settled that the Courts, in exercise of their power of judicial review,

do not ordinarily interfere with the policy decisions of the Executive unless the

policy can be faulted on grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness

or unfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness, irrationality, perversity and mala fide

will render the policy unconstitutional. However, if the policy cannot be faulted

on any of these grounds, the mere fact that it would hurt business interests of a

party, does not justify invalidating the policy.

[emphasis added]

However, as stated above, the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers is not a policy decision

and this court has the jurisdiction to consider the instant application.

28

Moreover, in Priyangani v. Nanayakkara and others (1996) 1 SLR 399 at 404-405, Fernando,

J. reiterated the interrelationship between the Right to Equality guaranteed by Article 12 of the

Constitution and Rule of Law. Furthermore, the Court held;

We are not concerned with contractual duties, but with the safeguards based

on the Rule of Law which Article 12 provides against the arbitrary and

unreasonable exercise of discretionary powers. Discretionary powers can

never be treated as absolute and unfettered unless there is compelling

language; when reposed in public functionaries, such powers are held in trust,

to be used for the benefit of the public, and for the purpose for which they have

been conferred - not at the whim and fancy of officials for political advantage or

personal gain.

[emphasis added]

Further, as stated above, given the facts and circumstances of the instant application, Article

43(1) of the Constitution cannot be construed as an ouster clause which can oust the jurisdiction

of the court to entertain the instant application.

When do retirement entitlements become due?

The Long Title of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986, states;

AN ACT to provide for the grant official residence and other allowances and

facilities to Former Presidents and to the widows of Former Presidents; to

provide for the payments of pensions to such widows; and for matters connected

with or incidental thereto.

[emphasis added]

Further, sections 2 and 3 of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 states;

2. Provision of residences.

There shall be provided to every Former President and the widow of a Former

President, during his or her life time, the use of an appropriate residence free

of rent:

29

Provided that where for any reason, an appropriate residence is not provided for

the use of such Former President for the widow of such Former President, there

shall be paid to such Former President or the widow of such Former President,

a monthly allowance equivalent to one-third of the monthly pension payable to

such Former President or the widow of such Former President, as the case may

be.

3. Payment of secretarial allowances and provision of official transport and

other facilities.

(1) There shall be paid to -

(a) every Former President, a monthly secretarial allowance equivalent to the

monthly salary for the time being payable to the person holding the office of

Private Secretary to the President; and

(b) to the widow of such Former President, a monthly secretarial allowance

equivalent to the monthly salary for the being payable to the person holding

the office of Private Secretary to a Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers.

(2) There shall be provided to every Former President and the widow of such

Former President, official transport and all such other facilities as are for the

time being provided to a Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers.

[emphasis added]

Accordingly, the word former used in the Long Title and in sections 2 and 3 of the said Act

shows that the provisions of the said Act are only applicable to former Presidents and widows

of former Presidents. Hence, the entitlements provided in the said Act become due only after

a President retires from office. Thus, no decision can be made to grant benefits under the said

Act prior to a President retiring from his office. However, the decision of the Cabinet of

Ministers under reference had been taken when the 1A respondent was functioning as the

President of the Republic.

30

A similar view was expressed by this court in Senarath and others v. Chandrika

Bandaranayake Kumaratunga and others (supra) at 71, where it was held;

The petitioners made a further submission that in any event the entitlements in

Act No.4 of 1986 are to "every former President and widow of a former

President". This is clearly seen in sections 2 and 3. Therefore it was submitted

that the entitlement becomes effective only after a President ceases to hold

office and acquires the status of former President. The entitlement cannot be

granted whilst the person is holding the office of President.

In my view the provisions have been advisedly worded in this manner to avoid

a situation as has happened in relation to the 1st respondent of the President

himself or herself partaking in decisions as to the entitlements to be given after

ceasing to hold office.

[emphasis added]

Furthermore, in the determination of Re the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution

(2002) 3 SLR 85, a Divisional Bench of seven judges of the Supreme Court laid down the basic

premise of the Constitution as enunciated in Articles 3 and 4, that the respective organs of the

government are only custodians for the time being, that exercise the power for the People.

Therefore, executive power should not be identified with the President and personalised and

should be identified at all times as the power of the People. Thus, the granting of public

property and public funds for personalised usage for oneself after retirement would be

considered an arbitrary and irrational abuse of the power bestowed upon the executive by the

People.

Is the decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers ultra vires?

As stated above, the Cabinet Memorandum contained the retirement benefits to be given to the

1A respondent. Further, the said Memorandum stated that due to special circumstances that

took place during the term of the 1A respondent, it was necessary to provide special facilities

for him.

31

The special facilities proposed to be provided were to allow the President the continued

occupation of his official residence after retirement and to provide the protection of the Special

Task Force.

Moreover, the said Memorandum stated that the services of the Special Task Force were to

be provided for the protection of the President's life which is endangered by local and

international groups affiliated to the drug trade due to the programs he has put in place to

bring to book those involved in the illegal drug trade while such threats have widened further

due to actions he has taken against terrorism and extremism in his capacity as the Minister of

Defense. This was implied to be the special circumstances during his tenure that necessitated

the granting of special facilities.

However, other than the said mere statement in the Memorandum, no materials were submitted

to the Cabinet of Ministers to substantiate the said assertion of the then Minister of Finance.

Accordingly, there was no material before the Cabinet of Ministers to support the contents of

the said Cabinet Memorandum at the time the impugned decision was made by the Cabinet of

Ministers.

In 2015, the media reported that a supplementary estimate of Rs. 180 million was allocated to

renovate and refurbish the official residence of the President. In response, on the 7th of October,

2015, the Media Division of the 1A respondent issued a press statement where the Secretary to

the President stated that the government had to rehabilitate and improve the residence of the

President by joining two old houses to bring it to proper condition which is suitable for the use

of the President. Thus, this residence consists of two houses merged in central Colombo.

Additionally, he stated that this residence was considered appropriate as the government had

to provide security to the official residence of the President and to provide accommodation

facilities for the security personnel of the President.

Furthermore, in the Counter Objections, the petitioners annexed two supplementary allocations

(marked as P13 and P14) provided by the Department of National Budget. The said

documents depict large amounts of State resources totalling Rs. 96,391,000, spent in 2015 for

the renovation of the said residence of the President, and an additional amount of Rs.

84,297,000 allocated to construct a new building within the compound. These allocations were

made when the 1A respondent was occupying the said premises as the President of the

32

Republic. Thus, there is no rational basis for affording a former President with a residence that

was built to be used by the head of State.

A similar view was expressed in the case of Senarath and others v. Chandrika

Bandaranayake Kumaratunga and others (supra), where it was held that the Memorandum

submitted to obtain the decision to grant the residence stated that the the value of land

requested is insignificant when compared with the entitlements she has given up and also

proposes to forego in the future. However, the land was originally intended for the

construction of the Presidential Palace and a sum of Rs. 800 million has already been spent by

the State to develop the land for the purpose of such construction. Thus, it was held that a

fully developed land near the Parliament cannot be considered insignificant. Furthermore, it

was held that the residence cannot be considered appropriate according to section 2 of the

said Act as it was a land developed for a different purpose.

Section 2 of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 provides a former President with

the use of an appropriate residence free of rent. However, this residence is situated in a

prime location and has used around Rs. 180 million State funds for renovation and

amalgamation for the purpose of being used by the President to carry out his official activities.

Thus, this specified residence cannot be considered as one singular house appropriate for a

President retired from office. Hence, a high financial value public asset constructed to occupy

a President of the Republic cannot be allocated to a former President who is no longer serving

as the Head of the State.

The Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 bestows the Cabinet of Ministers with powers

to decide the benefits a former President is entitled to. However, such a decision should be

taken according to the provisions of the said Act. Any decision taken in violation of the powers

conferred by the provisions of the Act or outside the scope of the said Act are ultra vires of the

powers conferred by the said Act.

A similar view was expressed in De Smiths Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 4th

Edition at page 96 which states;

Substantive ultra vires may relate to matters of law and fact or to matters of

discretion. Discretionary powers must be exercised for the purposes for which

they were granted; relevant considerations must be taken into account and

irrelevant considerations disregarded; they must be exercised in good faith and

33

not arbitrarily or capriciously. If the repository of the power fails to comply with

these requirements it acts ultra vires.

[emphasis added]

Further, in Administrative Law, 10th Edition at page 30, H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth states;

the court will hold the order to be ultra vires if the minister acted in bad faith

or unreasonably or on no proper evidence.

As such, the retirement benefits that were granted without proper materials to substantiate the

decision of the Cabinet of Ministers are beyond the powers granted by the said Act and are

irrational, unreasonable, arbitrary, ultra vires and illegal.

Is there a violation of the principles of Natural Justice?

It is pertinent to note that the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 grants entitlements

only to former Presidents and their widows, which is contrary to Article 12 of the Constitution

which enshrines the concept of equality before the law. No other holder of public office is

granted such benefits. As such, in Senarath and others v. Chandrika Bandaranayake

Kumaratunga and others (supra) at 77, the Supreme Court, held;

It has to be noted that the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 is a unique

piece of legislation which grants entitlements only to former Presidents and their

widows. Intrinsically it is an exception to the concept of equality before the law,

since no other holder of public office is granted such benefits. It appears that

there is no similar legal provision in any other country.

The provisions of this Act being an exception in itself to equality before the

law, have to be strictly interpreted and applied.

[emphasis added]

Article 43(2) of the Constitution states that the President is the head of the Cabinet.

Administrative law is founded on the two basic principles of natural justice, i.e.;

a man may not be a judge in his own cause/ Nemo judex in causa sua and

listen to the other side / Audi alteram partem

34

Hence, if the President participates and/or sits as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers when a

matter in which he has a personal interest is discussed and approved, such a decision is in

violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua.

Moreover, in Senarath and others v. Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga and others

(supra) at 71, Sarath N. Silva, CJ., held;

In official matters the general rule is that a person would refrain from

participating in any process where the decision relates to his entitlement or in a

matter where he has a personal interest. "Nemo judex in causa sua" is a

principle of natural justice which has now permeated the area of corporate

governance as well. This salient aspect of good governance has been thrown

to the winds by the 1st respondent in initiating several Cabinet Memoranda

during her tenure of office and securing for herself purported entitlements

that would if at all ensure only after she lays down the reigns of office and

acquire the eligible status of a former President.

[emphasis added]

In S.P. Guptha v. Union of India (1982) AIR (SC) at 149, Bhagawathi, J. observed;

If there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution,

it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary

which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the

limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law meaningful and effective. It

is to aid the judiciary in this task that the power of judicial review has been

conferred upon the judiciary and it is by exercising this power which constitutes

one of the most potent weapons in armoury of the law, that the judiciary seeks to

protect the citizen against violation of his constitutional or legal rights or misuse

of abuse of power by the State or its officers.

Moreover, though Article 43(2) of the Constitution states that the President is the head of the

Cabinet of Ministers, he can refrain from the decision making process if a matter related to him

comes up before him or such matters can be taken up at the Cabinet of Ministers when an Acting

President is functioning in place of the President in terms of the Constitution.

35

The concept of Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who will guard the guards themselves?),

would apply where the executive who acts as the custodian of the Peoples power would abuse

that power for personal benefits and not face any repercussions by the other branches of

governance. Accordingly, the securing of personal benefits and advantages for himself by

presiding over the Cabinet while still in power as the sitting President is a breach of the

provisions of the Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986, as it is intended for former

Presidents.

Moreover, as stated prior, the aforementioned impugned decision of the Cabinet of Ministers

violates the general principle of natural justice.

In the circumstances, I hold that the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers dated 15th of

October, 2019, provided the 1A respondent with entitlements beyond the scope offered by the

Presidents Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986. Further, the said decision is arbitrary, unreasonable,

ultra vires, illegal and amounts to a violation of the Rule of Law and the Fundamental Rights

guaranteed to the petitioners and citizens of Sri Lanka under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Accordingly, the application is allowed, and I quash the aforementioned decision of the Cabinet

of Ministers dated 15th of October, 2019 (marked and produced as P12).

No costs.
