de and to the best of his ability. Who can explain this? Only the accused can explain this,"
"not the counsel or the Judge. This opportunity was denied to the accused by the Trial at Bar."
"The Trial at Bar did not even invite the learned counsel to explain this."
"Intention"
"The Trial at Bar has also taken the view that the prosecution has failed to prove intention on"
"the part of the accused as required by section 100 of the Penal Code by strong and cogent"
"evidence (ප්‍රබල  හ කාවදින  ාක්ෂි). In addition to the defence taken up by learned counsel for"
"the former Inspector General of Police that adequate steps were taken to prevent the suicide"
"attacks, his other principal defence was grounded in the absence of intention on the part of"
"the accused. It is true that in terms of section 100 of the Penal Code “A person abets the"
"doing of a thing who intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.”"
"Intention is an essential ingredient in proving the offence. Learned Additional Solicitor General,"
"in his written submissions, has cited several foreign legal authorities to argue that intention"
"can  be  imputed  when  the  accused  foresees  the  result  of  his  illegal  omissions  as  virtual"
"certainty.  The  relationship  between  knowledge  and  intention  in  a  charge  of  abatement  by"
"illegal omission has also been a subject of considerable debate."
"In  my  view,  the  question  of  intention  was  not  seriously  and  adequately  addressed  at  the"
"argument  before  us;  the  primary  focus  was  on  the  adequacy  and  inadequacy  of the  steps"
"taken by the accused to prevent the suicide attacks. The question of intention is not a pure"
"question of law to be raised for the first time on appeal. It is a mixed question of fact and law."
"The question of intention was not explicitly raised as a distinct issue before the Trial at Bar."
"There was no opportunity for the Attorney General to make submissions before the Trial at"
"Bar regarding the question of intention or any other matter. Therefore, the Trial at Bar did"
"not have the advantage of hearing both parties before it decided that there was no intentional"
"aid on the part of the accused by illegal omission that enabled the suicide bombers to launch"
"the attacks."
"The Trial at Bar has simply gone on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove that the"
"omission was intentional. For the Trial at Bar, it was so obvious. When something is obvious,"
"we tend to refuse to afford a fair hearing stating that hearing makes no difference as the end"
"result  would  be the same.  This is a misguided  notion. A fair hearing could uncover critical"
"insights and perspectives that were not initially apparent. Megarry J. in John v. Rees [1970]"
