"උ: සජ්‍යේෂේඨ නිස ෝජ්‍ය ස ාලි ේ ති බ ේනාිර  ළාත් නන්දන මුනසිංහ මහතා21"
"Thus, it is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent that this Court"
"must  be  satisfied  with  this  action  as  a  meaningful  action  taken  intently  by  the  Accused-"
"Respondent in the discharge of his legal duty as the Inspector General of the country. The"
"position I have described with regard to Action No. 02 would equally apply to Action No. 03"
"as  well.  Thus,  if  the  Accused-Respondent  chooses  to  place  this  as  part  of  his  explanation"
"(rather than the mere argument by Counsel) then the Court would be in a position to decide"
"whether it should accept this as an intentional action taken by the Accused-Respondent in the"
"discharge of his legal duty in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police."
