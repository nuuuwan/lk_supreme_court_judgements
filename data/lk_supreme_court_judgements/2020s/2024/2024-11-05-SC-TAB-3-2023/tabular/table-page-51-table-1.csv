"T.S.  Fernando  J.  (with  the  agreement  of  H.N.G.  Fernando  C.J.)  affirmed  the  acquittal  and"
"cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the trial Court:"
"But in my view no reasonable court can accept the oral testimony of Papuraj that this"
"gratification was given to the first accused. Here is a person holding a responsible post"
"under Government and one day in the afternoon on the 16th March 1964 an unknown"
"car drove up to the compound. The car contained some people unknown to him, one"
"o
f
 
the persons possibly known to him – there is no proof even of that fact – walks up"
"to him who has by now come up to the parties and hands him quite openly Rs. 1000"
"which he accepts without any hesitation and he puts it into his shirt pocket. Similarly,"
"on the night of the 18th March 1964 an unknown car drives up to his house – in this"
"case the ancestral walauwa of the 1st accused – that the same person who on the"
"previous occasion is said to have given him Rs. 1000 walks up to him and the 1st"
"accused who has now come to the entrance of his house accepts this Rs. 4000 and"
"puts it his shirt pocket to be seen by the unknown persons in the car. On both"
"occasions the 1st accused does not appear to have been in anyway hesitant about"
"accepting the money. He does not appear to have been anxious to conceal the"
"acceptance from any person who may have seen it. He does not take the precaution"
"even of accepting the money without being seen by the unknown persons. It cannot"
"be said that he is unaware of the seriousness of the offence he is committing. He does"
"not seem to care as to whether he is led into a trap or not. I do not think any ordinary"
"person would accept a bribe in such a manner, least of all a person in the position of"
"the 1st accused who holds such a responsible post under Government."
