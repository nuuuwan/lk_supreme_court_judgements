"T
hus,  the  Accused-Respondent  has  relied  on  four  minutes  he  had  written,  one  on  the"
"document වි1 and the other three on the documents P 39, P 40 and P 41. The Accused-"
"Respondent has also relied on two solitary pieces of oral evidence which had emanated from"
"two  witnesses,  one  from  the  witness  Nilantha  Jayawardena  and  the  other  from  witness"
"Deshabandu Tennakoon in an attempt to convince Court that the Accused-Respondent had"
"indeed taken actions after he had received the eight pieces of information referred to in the"
"indictment which forms the basis for the charges. Thus, as has been already mentioned above,"
"even the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent has conceded before us that if not for"
"these four actions, this Court should hold that the High Court-at-Bar had erred in not calling"
"upon the Accused-Respondent for his defence under Section 200 of the CCPA. Let me consider"
"these four actions in the light of the background of the aforesaid submission made by  the"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  Accused-Respondent  to  ascertain  whether  indeed  the  Accused-"
"Respondent had taken all actions within his means, in his capacity as the Inspector General"
"of Police, upon receipt of the relevant information."
