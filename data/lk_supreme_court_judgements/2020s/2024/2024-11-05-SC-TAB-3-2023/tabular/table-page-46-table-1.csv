"purpose in “flogging a dead horse”. We ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the"
"development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical"
"end, to insist on technicality to the point almost of sanctifying it."
"The Five Judge Bench decision of this Court in Attorney General v. Gunawardena [1996] 2 Sri"
"LR  149  at  158-159  illustrates  the  scope  and  applicability  of  this  principle  in  the  following"
"manner:"
"Section 212(2) of the Administration of Justice Law provides: When the case for the"
"prosecution is closed, if the Judge considers that there is no evidence that the Accused"
"committed the offence he shall direct the Jury to return a verdict of “not guilty”."
"Under this provision the Judge can direct the Jury to return a verdict of not guilty only"
"a
t
 the close of the prosecution case. A practice appears to have developed in our"
"Courts of Judges stopping a case even before that stage is reached. This matter is"
"referred to in a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pauline de Croos v. The"
"Queen 71 NLR 169."
"“The procedure actually adopted by the learned Judge in this case, is to our knowledge,"
"not infrequently resorted to by Judges in this country when it becomes apparent to"
"the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and that there is no"
"purpose of “flogging a dead horse”. We ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the"
"development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical"
"end, to insist on technicality to the point of almost sanctifying it.”"
"There is no reason to disagree with this dictum; if it is apparent to Court as well as to"
"counsel that to continue is to waste time and to flog a dead horse, the case should of"
"course be stopped. Again, if prosecuting counsel concedes or is constrained to admit"
"that all the evidence on which the prosecution case is based has been led and what"
"remains to be led is formal evidence or other supporting evidence which will not take"
"the case any further, then the virtual end of the prosecution case has been reached"
"and a court may fairly act under Section 212(2). But if there is such other evidence"
"still to be led on behalf of the prosecution which the Judge has to reckon and give"
"weight to in considering whether there is a case to go to the Jury, it appears to us that"
"a
 
Judge will be acting contrary to S.212(2) in making a direction before he hears that"
"evidence."
