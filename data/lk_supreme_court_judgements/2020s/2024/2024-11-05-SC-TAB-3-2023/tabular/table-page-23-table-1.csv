"The fourth instance in the Section is the circumstance under which the  trial Judge can call","",""
"upon the Accused for his defence. It is set out in the Section in the following way:5","",""
"","D.","If, however, the Judge considers that there are grounds for proceeding, he shall"
"","","call upon the Accused for his defence."
"Thus, one would observe that the grounds set out in (A), (B) and (C) above are specific in","",""
"nature  but  to  the  contrary,  the  ground  set  out  in  (D)  above  is  very  wide.  This  is  because","",""
"“grounds for proceeding” have not been specifically set out in the Section and hence are not","",""
"exhaustive. Moreover, the phrase “If, however,” used in (D) above would serve to make the","",""
"ground in (D) above, a proviso to the grounds set out in (A), (B) and (C) above.","",""
"A","dmittedly the decision of the learned High Court Judges, not to call for the defence is not",""
"based on (A) above. On the other hand, neither party made any submission before this Court","",""
"in relation to the testimonial trustworthiness of the Prosecution witnesses as it was not the","",""
"focal point in this appeal.  Therefore, it is not necessary for me to consider the credibility of","",""
"the witnesses who provided evidence for the Prosecution.","",""
"I","n the above circumstances, I only have to consider two critical questions. The said questions",""
"are: firstly, whether the learned High Court Judges have erred in holding that the evidence","",""
"adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of the offence against the","",""
"Accused  in  the  indictment  or  any  other  offence  of  which  he  might  be  convicted  on  such","",""
"indictment.;  secondly,  whether  there  were  grounds  before  the  High  Court-at-Bar  which","",""
"compels it to have proceeded further with the trial under (D) above.","",""
"J","UDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT-AT-BAR",""
"After the Prosecution closed its case on 20-01-2022, and after the adjournment of the hearing,","",""
"the High Court-at-Bar on the next date i.e., on 18-02-2022, had pronounced two Judgments","",""
"in this case. One is a majority Judgment by two Judges and the other is a Judgment by a","",""
"single Judge (the other Judge). The conclusion arrived at, at the end of each Judgment is the","",""

"I","n the majority Judgment, a fundamental misdirection on law can be clearly observed. In that",""
