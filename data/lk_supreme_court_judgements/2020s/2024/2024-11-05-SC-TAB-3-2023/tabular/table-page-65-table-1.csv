"and  the  majority  deliberately  or  knowingly  resolved  to  ignore  the  settled  law  regarding"
"standard of proof expected at the close of the prosecution case. In my view, the law was not"
"settled at the time of the delivery of the impugned order of the Trial at Bar."
"As Justice Surasena has pointed out, the case at hand is not an ordinary murder or attempted"
"murder case to be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. It is a very complicated high-"
"profile trial where for the first time in our history, an Inspector General of Police was indicted"

"to prevent the suicide attacks. I do not wish to elaborate on this aspect further, given the final"
"conclusion reached by Justice Surasena, with which I entirely agree."
"If  I  may  stress  what  Justice  Surasena  has  already  stated,  in Samy and Others v. Attorney"
