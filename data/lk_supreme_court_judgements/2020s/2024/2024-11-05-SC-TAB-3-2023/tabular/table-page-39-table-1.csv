"church and a hotel where Indians inhabit in large numbers."
"I
t is the evidence of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that the Accused-Respondent did not even"
"take action to have a brief discussion as to any possible course of action to be taken on these"
"information received. Position is the same with regard to the four instances namely: after the"
"Information No. 04 sent to him on 18-04-2019 (P 39); after the Information No. 05 sent to"
"him on 19-04-2019 (P 40); after the Information No. 06 sent to him on 20-04-2019 (P 41);"
"and after the Information No. 07 sent to him on 20-04-2019 (P 43). It is to be noted that"
"witness Nilantha Jayawardena’s evidence is clear and unambiguous on this point.18 It is the"
"evidence  of  witness  Nilantha  Jayawardena  that  he  spoke  with  the  Accused-Respondent"
"through the mobile phone on 20-04-2019 since  he did  not get any  response or instruction"
"from the Accused-Respondent. Indeed, it is the position of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that"
"he had called the Accused-Respondent because he had felt that no action had been taken by"
"the  Accused-Respondent.  It  is  during  that  call  that  witness  Nilantha  Jayawardena  had"
"requested  from  the  Accused-Respondent  to  hand  over  that  information  to  the  Criminal"
"Investigation Department. It is to that request that the Accused-Respondent had responded"
"by saying to witness Nilantha Jayawardena “නිලන්ත ඔ ා රවීට කි න්න”."
"I
n my view, Court will not be in a position to assess this response in favour of the Accused-"
"Respondent in the absence of an explanation as to what the Accused-Respondent had meant"
"by  that  statement.  On  the  other  hand,  one  could  reasonably  expect  that  the  Accused-"
"Respondent, if called upon to place his defence, would have much more than these four words"
"as his explanation. The Court would then be in a position to effectively evaluate the case both"
"from the Prosecution’s point of view and that of the Defence. Thus, the Accused-Respondent"
"in  my  view,  is  obliged  in  law  to  explain  to  Court  as  to  why  he  failed  (if  he  had  failed),  to"
"appreciate  the  importance,  danger  and  seriousness  of these  information.  It  would  be  then"
"only that the Court would be in a position to properly evaluate with a view of accepting or"
"rejecting  Action  No.  02  as  an  intentional  action  taken  by  the  Accused-Respondent  in  the"
"discharge of his legal duty in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police."
