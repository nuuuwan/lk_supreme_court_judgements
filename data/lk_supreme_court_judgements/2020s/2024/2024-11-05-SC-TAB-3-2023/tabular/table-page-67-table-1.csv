"conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable determinations that, by"
"d
i
scussion, suffered a change."
"In light of the final conclusion reached by Justice Surasena, with which I concur, I shall refrain"
"from  exploring  the  question  of  intention  further  in  this  judgment.  Let  the  Trial  at  Bar  first"
"decide the question of intention by calling for the defence and hearing counsel for both parties."
"Alternative charges"
"There is another important matter trial Judges tend to overlook when an application under"
"section 200 is made. At the close of the prosecution case, the Judge must consider not only"
"whether there is prima facie evidence to call for the defence in respect of the offence charged"
"in the indictment, but also whether there is prima facie evidence to call for the defence in"
"respect of any other offence for which the accused might be convicted on the indictment. The"
"phrase “the accused might be convicted” indicates that there need not be strong and cogent"
"evidence on any other offence."
"The Trial at Bar ex mero motu considered section 298 of the Penal Code as an alternative"
"charge and rejected it, but learned Additional Solicitor General stated that the accused at least"
"might have been convicted under some other section, such as section 112 of the Penal Code."
"As Justice Surasena points out, the majority judgment has seriously fallen into an error when"
"they evaluated the facts of the case in light of section 107 of the Penal Code whereas the"
"accused was charged under section 102 read with sections 296 and 300 of the Penal Code."
"These obvious mistakes could have been avoided if the Trial at Bar took the decision after"
"hearing counsel for both parties."
"Hearing after the close of the prosecution case"
"The gravamen of the complaint of learned Additional Solicitor General was that the Trial at"
"Bar acquitted the accused without affording the Attorney General an opportunity to be heard."
"Conversely, Mr. Widura Ranawake, learned counsel for the accused submitted that there is no"
"legal  requirement  in  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  to  afford  a  hearing  once  the"
"prosecution has closed its case and before the Court decides whether to call for the defence."
