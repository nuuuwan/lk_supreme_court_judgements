"may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree depends on the"
"subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require"
"a

"negligence were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court,"
"even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require a"
"degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion. Likewise, a divorce"
"court should require a degree of probability which is proportionate to the subject-"
