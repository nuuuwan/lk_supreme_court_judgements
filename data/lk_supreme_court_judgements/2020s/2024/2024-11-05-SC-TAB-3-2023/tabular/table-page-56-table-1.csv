"constituted if there is no evidence of one of the basic elements required to prove the"
"charge."
"In Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de Silva (1967) 70 NLR 169 at 173, H.N.G. Fernando C.J."
"acknowledged that what needs to be established at that stage is a prima facie case."
"The question of the standard of proof required from the prosecution at the close of its case is"
"indeed  contentious  and  remains  a  subject  of  considerable  debate,  extending  beyond  local"
"jurisprudence. After careful and prolonged consideration, I regret that I am unable to concur"
"with the submission of Mr. Widura Ranawake."
"There is no duty cast on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable"
"doubt at the close of its case. At the stage of the close of the prosecution case, the proper"
"question for the Court to consider is whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie case"
"to call upon the accused for his defence, not whether the prosecution has proved the case"
"beyond reasonable doubt. The decision whether the accused is guilty of the charge beyond"
"reasonable doubt should be reserved until the conclusion of the entire trial."
"The next question is what is the meaning of prima facie case? There is a difference between"
"prima facie case and prima facie evidence. Sarker’s Law of Evidence, Vol I, 14th edition (1993),"
"page 45 defines prima facie evidence as “evidence which, if accepted, appears to be sufficient"
"to establish a fact unless rebutted by acceptable evidence to the contrary. It is not conclusive.”"
"In Ex parte Minister of Justice, re R v. Jacobson & Levy (1931) A.D. 466, Statford J.A. states"
"that “Prima facie evidence in its usual sense is used to mean prima facie proof of an issue,"
