"Fullagar,  Kitto  and  Taylor  JJ.  on  behalf  of  the  High  Court  of  Australia  in May v. O’Sullivan"
"(1955) 92 CLR 654 at page 658:"
"When, at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is"
"“no case to answer”, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it"
"stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands"
"he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless there is some"
"special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a “case to answer” has"
"no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning"
"to end. After the prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support proof of the"
"i
ssue, the defendant may or may not call evidence. Whether he does or not, the"
"question to be decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the whole of the"
"evidence before it, it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty."
"This is a question of fact. In deciding this question it may in some cases be legitimate,"
"as is pointed out in Wilson v. Buttery (1926) SASR 150 for it to take into account the"
"f
act that the defendant has not given evidence as a consideration making the inference"
"o
f
 guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe than it might otherwise"
"possibly appear: cf. Morgan v. Babcock & Wilcox, per Isaacs J. (1929) 43 CLR 163 at"
"178. But to say this is a very different thing from saying that the onus of proof shifts."
"A
 
magistrate who has decided that there is a “case to answer” may quite consistently,"
"i
f
 no evidence is called for the defendant, refuse to convict on the evidence for the"
"prosecution. The prosecution may have made “a prima facie case”, but it does not"
"f
o
l
l
ow that in the absence of a satisfactory answer the defendant should be convicted."
