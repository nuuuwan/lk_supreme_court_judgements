"2693, Lord Justice Hughes, delivering the judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, clarified"
"that such a course of action is permissible with the agreement of both parties:"
"That does not mean that it may not sometimes be appropriate and convenient for the"
"parties to agree to ask the Judge to rule as a matter of law whether on agreed or"
"admitted facts the offence charged is made out. A simple practical example is the"
"s
i
tuation where the end of the Crown case is nigh, subject only to outstanding evidence"
"which it can be known will take a particular form, for example the police interviews. It"
"may be administratively convenient for the parties to ask, or for the Judge to suggest,"
"that an expected submission of no case be made then rather than half a day later,"
"perhaps so that the jury is not unnecessarily inconvenienced. The key point is that the"
"outstanding evidence is known for certain; it is admitted or agreed what it will be. And"
"a
l
though the argument may be taken at that point, and a ruling made, any direction"
"to the jury to return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ ought ordinarily to await the end of the"
"Crown case, unless of course the Crown bows to the ruling and offers no further"
"evidence, as it might. Similarly, it may often happen that in advance of the calling of"
"any evidence at all the parties may agree that it would be helpful for the Judge to rule"
"upon the question whether, on agreed, admitted or assumed facts, the offence"
"charged would be made out. That may well be done with a view to the Crown accepting"
"that it may offer no evidence if the ruling is against it, just as it may be done with a"
"v
i
ew to a defendant considering whether to plead guilty if the ruling is otherwise. The"
"d
i
f
f
erence from the power here claimed is that the Judge is invited to proceed upon"
"established, or assumed and agreed, facts, and has no power to compel acquittal until"
