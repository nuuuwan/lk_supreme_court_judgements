"In some jurisdictions it is mandatory to hear both sides before taking a decision on “no case"
"to answer”. For instance, in India, section 232 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 states:"
"I

,
 after taking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing"
"the prosecution and the defence on the point, the Judge considers that there is no"
"evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Judge shall record an order of"
"acquittal."
"While accepting that there is no such express provision in our Code of Criminal Procedure Act"
"requiring  to  afford  a  hearing  at  that  stage,  I  must  state  that  there  is  no  prohibition  either"
"against inviting counsel for both parties to address the Court, particularly when the Court is"
"considering acquitting the accused in a complex case of this nature. As stated by Tambiah J."
"in Hevavitharana v. Themis de Silva (1961) 63 NLR 68 at 72, quoting with approval the famous"
"dictum of Mahmood J. in Narasingh Das v. Mangal Dubey (1883) 5 Allahabad 163 at 172:"
"Courts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as"
"prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse principle"
"that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to be prohibited"
"by the law. As a matter of general principle prohibition cannot be presumed."
"If a statute is silent on the requirement to afford a hearing to the party who will be affected"
"by a decision, the Court will imply a rule within the statutory provision that the principles of"
"natural  justice  are  observed.  Procedural  fairness  demands  such  a  course  of  action  to  be"
"followed. In Gamini Dissanayake v. M.C.M. Kaleel and Others [1993] 2 Sri LR 135 at 179 this"
"Court  observed  that  “today the courts presume, unless the contrary appears, that the"

egislature intended that powers conferred by it be exercised fairly, for although there are no"
"positive words in a statute, requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the"

"In the UK case of Barking and Dagenham Justices, ex parte DPP (1995) 159 JP 373, it was"
"held  that when the justices are provisionally inclined to uphold a submission of no case to"
