"has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability which in that case, the 4th"
"Accused had done."
"M
oreover, I also must emphasize here that the intention is a state of mind which under normal"
"circumstances, is inferred from other proven facts and circumstances. Indeed, this was the"
"same thinking in the case of The King v Marshall, where Dias J re-iterated that “the intention"
"o
f
 
an abettor must be presumed from the nature and effect of the facility given by him to the"
"doer of the act” as laid down in Rex v. Kadirgaman.12"
"I
 must also mention here that under the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, the"
"offence  of  Murder  is  constituted,  if  the  person  committing  the  act  knows  that  it  is  so"
"imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is"
"likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing"
"death  or  such  injury  as aforesaid.  In  light  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  the"
"phrase “without any excuse” mentioned in the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code"
"assumes a greater importance. Who has to provide the excuse in such circumstances? If there"
"is no apparent excuse, all that the Prosecution can prove is just that. It would then be the"
"accused who must take steps to place the excuse if he has one. If there is none, according to"
"the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, any act falling under the description therein,"
"may constitute the offence of Murder."
"T
hus, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I am of the view"
"that the High Court-at-bar, should have considered about the proof of the intention; degree"
"of such intention; whether knowledge on the part of the Accused-Respondent would amount"
"to the required intention, at the end of the case, i.e., after calling for the defence from the"
"Accused-Respondent."
"T
he  second  argument  advanced  by  Mr.  Widura  Ranawake  on  behalf  of  the  Accused-"
"Respondent  was  that  the  Accused-Respondent  in  his  capacity  as  the  Inspector  General  of"
"Police, had taken all possible actions within his means. The learned Counsel for the Accused-"
"Respondent pressed this position so hard and submitted before this Court that he agrees that"
"the High Court should have called upon the Accused-Respondent to place his defence had the"
"Accused-Respondent not taken such action."
