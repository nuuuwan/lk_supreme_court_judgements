"W
hen  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Accused-Respondent  was  making  the  above  submission"
"before this Court, this Court persistently asked him to show to this Court, the actions (if any)"
"which has been taken by the Accused-Respondent upon receipt of the relevant documentation"
"containing the information No. 1-8 upon which the Prosecution had framed charges against"
"him for failure to take any action on the said information. Then the learned Counsel for the"
"Accused-Respondent relied on four specific instances and urged this Court to hold that those"
"four specific instances have established that the Accused-Respondent has consciously taken"
"all possible actions within his means,  as the Inspector General of Police  of the country,  to"
"avert these bomb explosions, the occurrences of which are the subject matter of the charges"
"in the indictment in this case. It was on that basis that Mr. Widura Ranawake sought to justify"
"the decision of the learned High Court Judges, not to call for the defence from the Accused-"
"Respondent. In other words, it was his position that the fact that the Accused-Respondent"
"has taken all possible actions within his means, as the Inspector General of Police, is a position"
"borne out from the Prosecutionâ€™s case itself. He therefore submitted that there is no necessity"
"for this Court also to interfere with the decision of the learned High Court Judges as his client"
"has discharged his legal obligations by taking all steps within his means. These steps are those"
"four actions which the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent claims as actions his client"
"had  taken  in  respect  of  the  eight  pieces  of  information  sent  to  him  in  his  capacity  as  the"
"Inspector General of Police. It was on that basis that Mr. Widura Ranawake sought to argue"
"that there is no illegal omission on the part of the Accused-Respondent in his capacity as the"
"Inspector General of Police. On being repeatedly asked by Court, the learned Counsel for the"
"Accused-Respondent categorically informed Court that in the absence of such actions on the"
"part of the Accused-Respondent, the High Court-at-Bar should have called upon the Accused-"
"Respondent to explain as to how he had treated the relevant eight pieces of information which"
"he  had  received.  This  was  because  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Accused-Respondent  was"
"unable to place before this Court, at least any indication that the Accused-Respondent had"
"taken  any  other  action on  the  relevant  eight  pieces  of  information  which  he  had  received."
"Thus, it is needless to say that the case for the Accused-Respondent would either stand or fall"
"depending on the success or the failure of the above argument advanced on his behalf. Let"
"me now consider the above submission."
