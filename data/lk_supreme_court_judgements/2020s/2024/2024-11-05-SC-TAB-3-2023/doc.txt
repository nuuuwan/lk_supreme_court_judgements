The High Court-at-Bar on 22-11-2021 had read out charges to the Accused-Respondent and

he had pleaded not guilty to each count upon which the High Court-at-Bar had commenced

the trial against him.

The Prosecuting Counsel had made the opening address in terms of Section 199 (1) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the CCPA). The admissions1 were then recorded in terms of Section 420 of the CCPA on

several matters namely: the fact that the Accused-Respondent had held the office of the IGP

during the relevant time period including inter alia the occurrences of the bomb attacks; the

contents of the Postmortem reports of the deceased; the contents of the Medico Legal Reports

1Admissions recorded on 22-11-2021 at 10.05 am (pages 15-34), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 6 of 69

of the Injured; and the contents of the Government Analysts Reports relating to the crime

scenes.

During the trial in the High Court-at-Bar, the learned Deputy Solicitor General had led the

evidence of the following Prosecution Witnesses (PW):

1) Nilantha Jayawardena, Director/State Intelligence Service (SIS) (PW1);

2) C. D. Wickremaratne, IGP (PW 1214);

3) Deshabandu Tennakoon, the then DIG, Western North (PW 35);

4) Shirley Aaron, Coordinator (Inquiries) ,Legal Department, Mobitel Pvt. Ltd (PW

1034);

5) Nimal Senaratne, Chief Inspector, IGPs Secretariat, Police Headquarters,

Colombo (PW 1216); and

6) Chamila Damayanthi, Additional Deputy Registrar of the Colombo High Court.

On 20-01-2022, the Prosecution had informed the High Court-at-Bar that it would close its

case. The learned High Court Judges upon the Prosecution closing its case on 20-01-2022,

had adjourned the proceedings for 18-02-2022 to consider whether they would call for the

defence from the Accused-Respondent. On the next date, i.e., on 18-02-2022, the High Court-

at-Bar had pronounced the Order in that regard, and decided not to call for the defence from

the Accused-Respondent. The High Court-at-Bar acting under Section 200 (1) of the CCPA,

had decided to acquit the Accused-Respondent without calling for his defence.

Being aggrieved by the said decision of the High Court-at-Bar, the Attorney General has

appealed to this Court seeking to have the said High Court-at-Bar decision set aside by this

Court.

CHARGES IN THE INDICTMENT:

The Attorney General has framed the charges against the Accused-Respondent on the basis

that he had abetted the suicide bombers to commit the respective crimes on the respective

dates mentioned in several counts in the indictment. The said abetment is alleged to have

been committed by an illegal omission on his part, i.e., by his failure to prevent the commission

of those respective crimes in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police (IGP), even after

he was in receipt of the information more fully set out in the schedule () attached to the

indictment. It is on that basis that the Accused-Respondent is alleged to have committed all

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 7 of 69

the offences set out in the several counts in the indictment served on him. Those charges are

in respect of the deaths of persons who became victims of the afore-said bomb explosions

punishable under Section 296 read with Section 102 of the Penal Code and in respect of

injuries sustained by the persons who became victims of the afore-said bomb explosions

punishable under Section 300 read with Section 102 of the Penal Code. It is those charges

which have been set out in afore-said 855 counts in the indictment. At the outset, it must be

noted that the count No. 511 was in respect of the same deceased person as in count No.

501 and hence the learned Judges of the High Court-at-Bar had disregarded count No. 501.

Let me elaborate a little more on the charges in the indictment which I have already mentioned

above. These charges are based on the alleged illegal omission on the part of the Accused-

Respondent in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police. The said illegal omission is his

failure to take action in respect of the eight pieces of information sent to him in his capacity

as the Inspector General of Police. These eight pieces of information which forms the

foundation of the charges in the indictment have been distinctly identified in the Schedule

attached to the indictment. For easy reference, they are reproduced below.

Information No. 01

The first of the said eight pieces of information is an information sent to the Accused-

Respondent by the Director-State Intelligence Service on 09-04-2019. This information will

hereinafter sometimes be referred to in this Judgment as Information No. 01" or Information

No. 01 received on 09-04-2019. The Prosecution has relied on the document produced,

marked P 37 to prove that the Director-State Intelligence Service had in fact sent the

Information No. 01 to the Accused-Respondent on 09-04-2019.

Information No. 01 received on 09-04-2019 is as follows,

(1) When the case for the prosecution is closed, if the Judge wholly discredits the

evidence on the part of the prosecution or is of opinion that such evidence fails to

establish the commission of the offence charged against the accused in the indictment

or of any other offence of which he might be convicted on such indictment, he shall

record a verdict of acquittal; if however the Judge considers that there are grounds

for proceeding with the trial he shall call upon the accused for his defence.

It is important to bear in mind that the learned Counsel for both parties namely, the learned

Senior Additional Solicitor General Mr. Priyantha Nawanna PC, appearing for the Attorney-

General, and Mr. Widura Ranawake appearing for the Accused-Respondent have relied on the

Court of Appeal Judgment in the case of Attorney General vs Baranage2. It is also important

to note that the learned High Court Judges in their Judgments also have followed the judicial

principles laid down in that case. Thus, in the course of the proceedings of this case before

this Court no party had any complaints against the said Court of Appeal Judgment in Attorney

General vs. Baranage. They indeed have placed reliance on the principles of law enunciated

by Hon. Justice Gamini Amaratunga3 for the purposes of their respective cases.

According to Section 200 of the CCPA there are only three instances under which the trial

Judge can record a verdict of acquittal without calling for the defence from the Accused. These

three instances can be identified in the Section in the following way:4

If the Judge:

A. wholly discredits the evidence on the part of the Prosecution; or,

B. is of the opinion that such evidence fails to establish the commission of the offence

against the Accused in the indictment: or,

C. is of the opinion that such evidence fails to establish any other offence of which

he might be convicted on such indictment;

he shall then record a verdict of acquittal.

2 (2003) 1 SLR 340. 3 As he was then. 4 I have marked these instances as A, B and C.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 23 of 69

The fourth instance in the Section is the circumstance under which the trial Judge can call

upon the Accused for his defence. It is set out in the Section in the following way:5

D. If, however, the Judge considers that there are grounds for proceeding, he shall

call upon the Accused for his defence.

Thus, one would observe that the grounds set out in (A), (B) and (C) above are specific in

nature but to the contrary, the ground set out in (D) above is very wide. This is because

grounds for proceeding have not been specifically set out in the Section and hence are not

exhaustive. Moreover, the phrase If, however, used in (D) above would serve to make the

ground in (D) above, a proviso to the grounds set out in (A), (B) and (C) above.

Admittedly the decision of the learned High Court Judges, not to call for the defence is not

based on (A) above. On the other hand, neither party made any submission before this Court

in relation to the testimonial trustworthiness of the Prosecution witnesses as it was not the

focal point in this appeal. Therefore, it is not necessary for me to consider the credibility of

the witnesses who provided evidence for the Prosecution.

In the above circumstances, I only have to consider two critical questions. The said questions

are: firstly, whether the learned High Court Judges have erred in holding that the evidence

adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of the offence against the

Accused in the indictment or any other offence of which he might be convicted on such

indictment.; secondly, whether there were grounds before the High Court-at-Bar which

compels it to have proceeded further with the trial under (D) above.

JUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT-AT-BAR

After the Prosecution closed its case on 20-01-2022, and after the adjournment of the hearing,

the High Court-at-Bar on the next date i.e., on 18-02-2022, had pronounced two Judgments

in this case. One is a majority Judgment by two Judges and the other is a Judgment by a

single Judge (the other Judge). The conclusion arrived at, at the end of each Judgment is the

same.

In the majority Judgment, a fundamental misdirection on law can be clearly observed. In that

Judgment the learned High Court Judges have taken the view that the Prosecution is obliged

5 I have marked this instance as D.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 24 of 69

to adduce very strong and penetrating evidence ( ) against the Accused-

Respondent to enable the Court to conclude that the Accused-Respondent is responsible for

the abetment of the crimes described in the indictment as a principal offender as per Section

107 of the Penal Code. The said view of the High Court Judges can be seen clearly from

paragraphs 144, 145, 146, 182, 188 of the majority Judgment. Thus, let me now consider

whether Section 107 of the Penal Code has become relevant in the instant case. To start with,

Section 107 of the Penal Code is reproduced below.

Abettor present when offence is committed.

107. Whenever any person who, if absent, would be liable to be punished as

an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable

in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have

committed such act or offence.

I must mention at the beginning of this discussion that Mr. Widura Ranawake appearing for

the Accused-Respondent conceded before us that this assertion by the learned High court

Judges is clearly erroneous as it has no relevance for the proof of the charges in the indictment

in this case. I agree. The Attorney General has not filed charges against the Accused-

Respondent based on Section 107 of the Penal Code. Indeed, it is the learned High Court

Judges who have imported Section 107 of the Penal Code in to the charges in the indictment

of this case. Having imported that Section in to the charges by themselves, the learned High

Court Judges now have concluded that the Prosecution is obliged to place evidence before

Court in such a way that the Accused-Respondent could be held responsible as a principal

offender in terms of Section 107 of the Penal Code.

A mere glance through the above Section is enough to say that Section 107 of the Penal Code

has no application whatsoever to this case. Indeed, the purpose of Section 107 has been

clearly set out in the very quotation cited by the learned High Court Judges in paragraph 146

of their Judgment. The said quotation is as follows:

A point which needs emphasis in connection with section 107 is that the

principal which it embodies, is applicable only in circumstances where all the

essential elements of abetment are established, so that the accused would be

liable as an abettor, had he not been present at the commission of the offence.

Section 107 does not impose criminal liability on a person who, although

present when the offence was committed, would not have been liable as an

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 25 of 69

abettor if he had been absent. In other words, presence at the commission of

the crime, in itself, is not a decisive consideration and does not necessarily

facilitate proof of the independent requirements of abetment. Whether the

accused is absent or present, the burden of establishing the requisite elements

of abetment devolves on the prosecution. The only effect of the provision

contained in section 107 is that, after all these elements are proved, the further

circumstance of the accused's presence enables him to be dealt with qua the

principal offender, and not merely as abettor. 6

As has already been adverted to above, the Attorney General has not charged the Accused-

Respondent under Section 107 of the Penal Code. Therefore, there is absolutely no

justification for addition of Section 107 to the charges in the indictment by the learned High

Court Judges. It is relevant and significant to note the time at which the learned High Court

Judges have adopted this interpretation. The time is after the Prosecution closed its case.

Thus, obviously, it was not practically possible for the Prosecution to place evidence before

Court in such a way that the Accused-Respondent could be held responsible as a principal

offender in terms of Section 107 of the Penal Code. In my view, this conclusion reached by

the learned High Court Judges is grossly erroneous and unwarranted in light of the facts and

circumstances of this case. Such a conclusion is untenable.

This misconception of law which the two learned High Court Judges had strongly entertained

had prompted them to look for strong and compelling evidence ( ) in the

Prosecution case in order to hold the Accused-Respondent responsible as the principal

offender. This was not the charge presented in the indictment. This was not the case

presented by the Prosecution. Thus, the necessary inference from the above position is the

fact that the two learned High Court Judges had totally failed to consider whether the evidence

adduced by the Prosecution has established the case presented by the Attorney General

against the Accused-Respondent. This misdirection on the part of the two learned High Court

Judges in the majority Judgment is so serious and so grave. Thus, the learned High Court

Judges in the majority Judgment could not have lawfully taken the view that the evidence

adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of the offence against the

Accused-Respondent in the indictment in terms of limbs (B) or (C) in Section 200 (1). This is

simply because they had failed to understand the charges presented in the indictment and

6G.L. Peiris, General Principles of Criminal Liability in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), (2nd Revised Edn, Lake House 1980) 401.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 26 of 69

the case presented by the Prosecution against the Accused-Respondent. Thus, the charge

they had in mind when they proceeded to consider evidence in the process of ascertaining

whether the evidence adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of

the offence against the Accused in the indictment, was not the charge mentioned in the

indictment. Hence the final conclusion reached in the majority Judgment based on such

misconception becomes untenable for that reason alone. Therefore, the majority Judgment

by the two learned High Court Judges cannot be permitted to stand on that account.

Although the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent conceded the afore-stated

misconception in the majority Judgment by the two learned High Court Judges, he sought to

argue that this Court must nevertheless consider whether the evidence adduced by the

Prosecution makes this case one falling under limb (B) above.

The learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent in the course of his lengthy submissions

before this Court, advanced two-pronged argument seeking to establish that the case for the

Prosecution has fallen under limb (B). His first argument is that there is no evidence to

establish the required mens rea which is necessary to prove the charges in the indictment.

His second argument is that evidence had emanated from the Prosecution case itself to

establish before this Court that the Accused-Respondent had taken all actions within his means

in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police upon the receipt of the relevant information

and therefore the Accused-Respondent need not explain any further, the allegation against

him that he had abetted by illegal omission facilitating the commission of the offences.

Let me now consider the afore-mentioned first argument. The learned Counsel for the

Accused-Respondent relied on the Judgment in the case of The King v Marshall,7 to argue that

in a charge of abetment of murder, it is incumbent upon the Prosecution to prove that the aid

given by an abettor is intentional aid. Let me first briefly advert to the facts of that case. The

facts are as follows:

S. Deonis is the son of the deceased of that case S. Jamis. Both the son and the

father, after having tea at a boutique in the village, started walking back from the

boutique. Neither of them was armed. On the way, a quarrel arose between the

sixth Accused and the son. The other Accused who were on the road joined in. They

7 51 NLR 157.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 27 of 69

surrounded the father and the son and began to assault them. Thereupon, two

other villagers had intervened and rescued the son and took him back to the

boutique where the father and the son earlier had tea. Thereafter, they returned to

the place of attack with a view of extricating the father (the deceased). At that time,

the first, fourth, and seventh Accused were holding and dragging the deceased man

(father). The first Accused was holding the deceased by his right arm, the fourth

Accused by his left arm and the seventh Accused was grasping the hair of the

deceased. Then the second Accused, who at that time was some distance away,

rushed in from behind, ran up to the deceased and struck a blow with a katty which

turned out to be the fatal blow. Thereupon the first, fourth, and seventh Accused

left the deceased and dispersed.

In the indictment in the case of The King v Marshall, there were eight Accused and five counts.

All eight Accused were charged in the first count for being members of an unlawful

assembly, the common object of which was to cause hurt to S. Jamis and S. Dionis, an offence

punishable under Section 140 of the Penal Code. All eight Accused were charged in the

second count for rioting, an offence punishable under Section 144. All eight Accused were

charged in the third count for committing the death of S. Jamis, an offence punishable

under Sections 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code. The fourth count of the

indictment was only against the second Accused for committing the murder of S. Jamis, an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code. The fifth count of the indictment

was only against the first, fourth, and seventh Accused for the abetment to the second

Accused to commit the murder of Jamis, an offence punishable under Section 296 read with

Section 102 of the Penal Code.

The Jury in the case of The King v Marshall, had acquitted all the Accused from the first,

second and third counts which were framed to impute criminal liability on them on the

principle that they were members of the said unlawful assembly. The Jury had convicted the

second Accused under the fourth count. The Jury had also convicted the first, fourth,

and seventh Accused under fifth count for the abetment to the second Accused to

commit the murder of Jamis.

The Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of The King v Marshall, for the reasons set out in the

said Judgment, had held that there was ample evidence against the second Accused which

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 28 of 69

justified the Jurys verdict that the second Accused is guilty of the fourth count and hence

dismissed the appeal of the second Accused.

However, as regards the abetment charge, which is the fifth count in that case, Dias J held as

follows:

Furthermore, the indictment stated that the offence of the second accused

was committed "in consequence of the abetment" by the first, fourth, and fifth

accused. The explanation to section 102 of the Penal Code says: "An act is said

to be committed in consequence of abetment" when it is "committed with the

aid which constitutes the abetment". We cannot see how on the facts of this

case it can be said that the conduct of these accused in holding the deceased

and dragging him for some purpose of their own, amounts to aid intentionally

given to the second accused to facilitate him to murder the deceased. This

aspect of the matter was not put to the Jury, and amounts to non-direction.8

In the case of The King v Marshall, it was the 2nd Accused who had suddenly come from a

somewhat distant place, ran up with a katty, and then struck the deceased, the fatal blow.

When the 2nd Accused struck the deceased with the said blow, the first, fourth and seventh

Accused in that case were holding and dragging the Deceased. It was in that backdrop that

Dias J held that the conduct of the first, fourth and seventh Accused in that case in holding

the deceased and dragging him for some purpose of their own, cannot amount to an aid

intentionally given to the second Accused to facilitate the murder of the deceased as per the

charge in the fifth count in that case.

Moreover, in the case of The King v Marshall, it must be noted that the Trial Court had called

upon the Accused to place their defence. Thus, the position placed by the defence was

available before the Court of Criminal Appeal when it was called upon to consider and decide

the final outcome of the case. In the instant case, Court is yet to hear from the Accused-

Respondent as to his position with regard to the omissions alleged against him by the

Prosecution. In the above circumstances, the facts and the conclusion of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in The King v Marshall, is clearly distinguishable from the facts of the instant case.

8 51 NLR 157 at page 160.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 29 of 69

The learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent also relied on the Judgment of Weerasuriya

J in the case of Samy and others v Attorney-General (Bindunuwewa murder case).9 He

highlighted the following extract from the said Judgment.

Having regard to the departmental orders referred to above if the Officer-in-

Charge has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability, he

cannot be faulted for the action he has taken even if it may appear that another

course of action would have proved more effective in the circumstances.

However, I observe that Weerasuriya J in that case, has stated that paragraph in his Judgment

when he was dealing with the case against the 4th Accused in that case who was a Police

Officer. The charges against the said 4th Accused (Police Officer) were based on illegal

omissions which consisted of the general allegation of intentional failure to comply with the

duty imposed by law and certain specific illegal omissions in his capacity as a Police Officer.

The charges against the 4th Accused in that case, were based under Section 146 of the Penal

Code. The Court in that case had held that there was no evidence to establish that the 4th

Accused being a Police Officer, had intentionally joined the unlawful assembly with the object

of causing hurt to the detainees. Furthermore, the High Court-at-Bar in that case had called

for the defence from the said 4th Accused and the 4th Accused in that case had provided an

explanation and the reasons for not shooting at the attackers directly. His explanation was his

inability to distinguish between the detainees and the villagers in the commotion. It was in

the face of the said defence placed by the 4th Accused that Weerasuriya J in that case had

held that the mere fact that there was a duty to act in the given circumstances and death had

resulted due to the said failure to act, will not be sufficient to establish the offence.10 One has

to be mindful that in the instant case, the Accused-Respondent has not yet provided an

explanation or reasons as the High Court-at-Bar decided not to call for the defence from him.

Thus, the facts and circumstances of Bindunuwewa murder case is also clearly

distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the instant case. Furthermore, the phrase

if the Officer-in-Charge has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability,

found in the dictum quoted above from the Judgment of Weerasuriya J in Bindunuwewa

murder case,11 shows clearly that it is incumbent upon the accused to satisfy Court that he

9 (2007) 2 SLR 216. 10 Supra at page 237. 11 (2007) 2 SLR 216.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 30 of 69

has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability which in that case, the 4th

Accused had done.

Moreover, I also must emphasize here that the intention is a state of mind which under normal

circumstances, is inferred from other proven facts and circumstances. Indeed, this was the

same thinking in the case of The King v Marshall, where Dias J re-iterated that the intention

of an abettor must be presumed from the nature and effect of the facility given by him to the

doer of the act as laid down in Rex v. Kadirgaman.12

I must also mention here that under the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, the

offence of Murder is constituted, if the person committing the act knows that it is so

imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is

likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing

death or such injury as aforesaid. In light of the facts and circumstances of this case, the

phrase without any excuse mentioned in the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code

assumes a greater importance. Who has to provide the excuse in such circumstances? If there

is no apparent excuse, all that the Prosecution can prove is just that. It would then be the

accused who must take steps to place the excuse if he has one. If there is none, according to

the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, any act falling under the description therein,

may constitute the offence of Murder.

Thus, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I am of the view

that the High Court-at-bar, should have considered about the proof of the intention; degree

of such intention; whether knowledge on the part of the Accused-Respondent would amount

to the required intention, at the end of the case, i.e., after calling for the defence from the

Accused-Respondent.

The second argument advanced by Mr. Widura Ranawake on behalf of the Accused-

Respondent was that the Accused-Respondent in his capacity as the Inspector General of

Police, had taken all possible actions within his means. The learned Counsel for the Accused-

Respondent pressed this position so hard and submitted before this Court that he agrees that

the High Court should have called upon the Accused-Respondent to place his defence had the

Accused-Respondent not taken such action.

12 41 NLR 534 at pages 535-536.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 31 of 69

When the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent was making the above submission

before this Court, this Court persistently asked him to show to this Court, the actions (if any)

which has been taken by the Accused-Respondent upon receipt of the relevant documentation

containing the information No. 1-8 upon which the Prosecution had framed charges against

him for failure to take any action on the said information. Then the learned Counsel for the

Accused-Respondent relied on four specific instances and urged this Court to hold that those

four specific instances have established that the Accused-Respondent has consciously taken

all possible actions within his means, as the Inspector General of Police of the country, to

avert these bomb explosions, the occurrences of which are the subject matter of the charges

in the indictment in this case. It was on that basis that Mr. Widura Ranawake sought to justify

the decision of the learned High Court Judges, not to call for the defence from the Accused-

Respondent. In other words, it was his position that the fact that the Accused-Respondent

has taken all possible actions within his means, as the Inspector General of Police, is a position

borne out from the Prosecutions case itself. He therefore submitted that there is no necessity

for this Court also to interfere with the decision of the learned High Court Judges as his client

has discharged his legal obligations by taking all steps within his means. These steps are those

four actions which the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent claims as actions his client

had taken in respect of the eight pieces of information sent to him in his capacity as the

Inspector General of Police. It was on that basis that Mr. Widura Ranawake sought to argue

that there is no illegal omission on the part of the Accused-Respondent in his capacity as the

Inspector General of Police. On being repeatedly asked by Court, the learned Counsel for the

Accused-Respondent categorically informed Court that in the absence of such actions on the

part of the Accused-Respondent, the High Court-at-Bar should have called upon the Accused-

Respondent to explain as to how he had treated the relevant eight pieces of information which

he had received. This was because the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent was

unable to place before this Court, at least any indication that the Accused-Respondent had

taken any other action on the relevant eight pieces of information which he had received.

Thus, it is needless to say that the case for the Accused-Respondent would either stand or fall

depending on the success or the failure of the above argument advanced on his behalf. Let

me now consider the above submission.

Specific instances, that the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent relied on, as actions,

the Accused-Respondent had taken in respect of the eight pieces of information sent to him

could be enumerated as follows referring to them as Actions 1-4 for easy reference.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 32 of 69

Action 01:

i. The three letters F.N.A. written by the Accused-Respondent on the

letter addressed to the Respondent, dated 09th April 2019 sent by A. N.

Sisira Mendis, Chief of National intelligence (CNI). This letter has been

produced (marked 1) in the trial. I have reproduced below, a scanned

copy of the note containing the above letters (F. N. A.) written by the

Accused-Respondent on that letter.

Action 02:

ii. The fact that the Accused-Respondent had told the Director of National

Intelligence Service Nilantha Jayawardhena . The learned

Counsel for the Accused-Respondent relied on a solitary piece of

evidence from the long evidence given by the Director of National

Intelligence Service Nilantha Jayawardhena in his endeavour to

establish that ( ) as an action taken by the Accused-

Respondent on the information provided to him. The relevant piece of

evidence of the said witness Nilantha Jayawardhena is reproduced

below.

Action 03:

iii. The fact that the Accused-Respondent had told the Director of National

Intelligence Service Nilantha Jayawardhena on 20

April 2019. The learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent relied on

the following piece of evidence given by the Director of National

Intelligence Service Nilantha Jayawardhena in this regard. The relevant

piece of evidence of the said witness Nilantha Jayawardhena is

reproduced below.

Action 04:

iv. The fact that the Accused-Respondent had written the minutes dated

21 April 2019 on documents produced, marked P 39, P 40 and P 41,

which had contained Information Nos. 04, 05 and 06. This minute is

similar in all those three documents and hence it would suffice to

reproduce one of those below:

13 Record of proceedings on 22-11-2021 at 9.35 am (page 4), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV. 14 Record of proceedings on 26-11-2021 at 9.50 am (pages 3-4), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 34 of 69

Thus, the Accused-Respondent has relied on four minutes he had written, one on the

document 1 and the other three on the documents P 39, P 40 and P 41. The Accused-

Respondent has also relied on two solitary pieces of oral evidence which had emanated from

two witnesses, one from the witness Nilantha Jayawardena and the other from witness

Deshabandu Tennakoon in an attempt to convince Court that the Accused-Respondent had

indeed taken actions after he had received the eight pieces of information referred to in the

indictment which forms the basis for the charges. Thus, as has been already mentioned above,

even the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent has conceded before us that if not for

these four actions, this Court should hold that the High Court-at-Bar had erred in not calling

upon the Accused-Respondent for his defence under Section 200 of the CCPA. Let me consider

these four actions in the light of the background of the aforesaid submission made by the

learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent to ascertain whether indeed the Accused-

Respondent had taken all actions within his means, in his capacity as the Inspector General

of Police, upon receipt of the relevant information.

Action 01:

Let me now consider the Action 01 claimed to have been taken by the Accused-Respondent

by placing a notation on the document 1. I have reproduced above, this notation. The

Accused-Respondent had addressed this minute to four persons. This is brought out by the

evidence of the witness Deshabandu Tennakoon at page 448, Volume IV of the Appeal Brief.

The four officers mentioned therein, are:

Senior DIG Western Province and Traffic

Director Special Security Division

DIG CID

DIG STF

The witness Deshabandu Tennakoon has stated that the Accused-Respondent had addressed

this minute to the afore-said four senior officers to draw their attention to the information

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 35 of 69

contained in 1 which he had received on 09-04-2019. The date of this minute also appears

to be 09-04-2019. Learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent made somewhat lengthy

submissions on 1. However, the information in letter 1, is an information which states that

some terrorist attack in Sri Lanka was being planned to target some important churches and

the Indian High Commission. In 1, there is no specific date on which these attacks would

possibly happen.

Thereafter relying on DIG Deshabandu Tennakoons oral evidence, the learned Counsel for

the Accused-Respondent pointed out that DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon, upon receipt of 1

from his senior DIG (Nandana Munesinghe), has written five instructions to his subordinates.

These five instructions are to the following effect:

, .

, .

.

,

.

.

.

.15

Thus, it is the position of the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent that it was the

Accused-Respondent by his notation on 1 who had triggered those five instructions being

given to the police officers below. It was his submission that the Inspector General of Police

is not obliged personally to go and provide security to the respective places as it is not

practicable to do so. Therefore, it was his submission that in his capacity as the Inspector

15 Record of proceedings on 18-01-2022 at 10.00 am (pages 3-4), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 36 of 69

General of Police that, the giving of the above five instructions was the action he could take

upon receipt of that information sent to him on 08-04-2021.

A closer look at the evidence of Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Deshabandu

Tennakoon, which was relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent in his

attempt to convince Court that the Accused-Respondent had discharged his obligations as the

Inspector General of Police, would show that whatever the actions DIG Deshabandu

Tennakoon had taken, are the actions solely taken by said DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon. They

are not actions taken by the Accused-Respondent. The question whether those actions are

sufficient actions which DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon ought to have taken is another matter.

Be that as it may, it is clear that the Accused-Respondent had not thought it fit, at least to

give his mind or to initiate any one of those actions which DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon had

taken. The Accused-Respondent, despite the seriousness of the imminent threat to the

National Security, the information of which was clearly given to him, was only content in

writing three letters F.N.A and pass it down the line. Indeed, what is meant by F.N.A. is also

not explained. It is only the Accused-Respondent who knows as to what he had meant by

those three letters and what should have been understood by the other officers down the line.

The learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent has taken up the above position despite the

fact that the Accused-Respondent had admitted in the trial, the fact that the Inspector General

of Police is under legal obligation to do all acts in terms of Section 56 of the Police Ordinance.

It is pertinent to reproduce the said admission. It is as follows,

This position could better be understood by looking at the said Section (Section 56 of the

Police Ordinance) which is also reproduced below.

Every police officer shall for all purposes in this Ordinance contained be considered to

be always on duty, and shall have the powers of a police officer in every part of Sri

Lanka, It shall be his duty

(a) to use his best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes, offences, and public

nuisances ;

(b) to preserve the peace ;

(c) to apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters ;

(d) to detect and bring offenders to justice ;

(e) to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace ; and

(f) promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued and

directed to him by any competent authority

Moreover, the evidence of the then Inspector General of Police (Prosecution Witness No. 1214

IGP Chandana Deepal Wickramaratne) on the use of the three letters F.N.A. by a senior officer,

was referred to in the Judgment as follows:

, FNA

. FNA , For Necessary Action

,

. ,

,

.17

Therefore, the learned High Court Judges (in their majority Judgment) were mindful that there

was such evidence in the trial. The learned High Court Judges have referred to this evidence

16 Paragraphs 22 () and 22 () of the Judgment of the High Court-at-Bar, dated 18-02-2022, at pages 60-61. 17 Paragraph 50 of the Judgment of the High Court-at-Bar, dated 18-02-2022, at page 71.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 38 of 69

in paragraph 50 (Pg 71) of the majority Judgment. However, the learned High Court Judges

had opted not to act on the said evidence giving no reason thereto.

If F.N.A. is to mean For Necessary Action, (if that is what it stands for in general parlance)

the Trial Court will have to consider whether that would be an abbreviated instruction that

any senior public officer would write even on any unimportant letter or document. In view of

the seriousness of the information which clearly divulged a very serious threat to the National

Security of the country, the Trial Court will have to consider whether writing the three letters

F.N.A. would be a sufficient discharge of obligations by the person under whose command

the entire Police Force of the country has been placed. The Accused-Respondent has not

offered any explanation so far. It is his Counsel who argues that this must be taken as one of

the explanations. Thus, while it is not an explanation offered by the Accused-Respondent,

whether the Court would accept it, if the Accused-Respondent does give it as an explanation

is yet to be seen.

Action 02

The Accused-Respondent has received Information No. 06 (P 41) on 20-04-2019. This

information gives number of details about the people involved in preparation of the suspected

attacks.

P 39 (Information No. 04) which was received by the Accused-Respondent on 18-04-2019

contains specific information about the persons in relation to the incident of the dry-run where

a motorcycle was exploded in Kaththankudi on 16-04-2019.

The Information No. 05 (P 40) which was received by the Accused-Respondent on 19-04-

2019 has given further details of persons involved in the dry-run which had happened on 16-

04-2019.

Information No. 06 (P 41) which the Accused-Respondent had received on 20-04-2019 has

given further information on the afore-said persons.

Finally, through the Information No. 07 (P 43) the Accused-Respondent had received exact

information that the aforesaid suspected persons would be likely to carry out the attack at

any time on or before 21-04-2019. Information No. 07 has also been conveyed to the Accused-

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 39 of 69

Respondent that these suspected persons have reportedly selected eight places including a

church and a hotel where Indians inhabit in large numbers.

It is the evidence of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that the Accused-Respondent did not even

take action to have a brief discussion as to any possible course of action to be taken on these

information received. Position is the same with regard to the four instances namely: after the

Information No. 04 sent to him on 18-04-2019 (P 39); after the Information No. 05 sent to

him on 19-04-2019 (P 40); after the Information No. 06 sent to him on 20-04-2019 (P 41);

and after the Information No. 07 sent to him on 20-04-2019 (P 43). It is to be noted that

witness Nilantha Jayawardenas evidence is clear and unambiguous on this point.18 It is the

evidence of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that he spoke with the Accused-Respondent

through the mobile phone on 20-04-2019 since he did not get any response or instruction

from the Accused-Respondent. Indeed, it is the position of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that

he had called the Accused-Respondent because he had felt that no action had been taken by

the Accused-Respondent. It is during that call that witness Nilantha Jayawardena had

requested from the Accused-Respondent to hand over that information to the Criminal

Investigation Department. It is to that request that the Accused-Respondent had responded

by saying to witness Nilantha Jayawardena .

In my view, Court will not be in a position to assess this response in favour of the Accused-

Respondent in the absence of an explanation as to what the Accused-Respondent had meant

by that statement. On the other hand, one could reasonably expect that the Accused-

Respondent, if called upon to place his defence, would have much more than these four words

as his explanation. The Court would then be in a position to effectively evaluate the case both

from the Prosecutions point of view and that of the Defence. Thus, the Accused-Respondent

in my view, is obliged in law to explain to Court as to why he failed (if he had failed), to

appreciate the importance, danger and seriousness of these information. It would be then

only that the Court would be in a position to properly evaluate with a view of accepting or

rejecting Action No. 02 as an intentional action taken by the Accused-Respondent in the

discharge of his legal duty in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police.

Action No. 03

18 Page 245-254 of Volume IV of the brief.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 40 of 69

It is the evidence of witness Nilantha Jayawardena that the information he received on 20-

04-2019 (P 43) is a reliable information. Indeed, it can be seen from the contents of

Information No. 07 itself. It appears that witness Nilantha Jayawardena had immediately

forwarded this information to the Accused-Respondent through a WhatsApp message due to

its importance and urgency. That was also done on the same date, i.e., 20-04-2019.

Information No. 07 has been received by a foreign intelligence agency. It is after sending

Information No. 07 to the Accused-Respondent that witness Nilantha Jayawardena had called

the Accused-Respondent again. This was after witness Nilantha Jayawardena had received

confirmation about this information at 4.16 pm on 20-04-2019. Witness Nilantha Jayawardena

through this call had verbally also brought this information to the notice of the Accused-

Respondent and highlighted the trustworthiness and reliability of this information. It would be

worthwhile to reproduce his evidence in this regard, which is as follows:

: 21

Thus, it is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent that this Court

must be satisfied with this action as a meaningful action taken intently by the Accused-

Respondent in the discharge of his legal duty as the Inspector General of the country. The

position I have described with regard to Action No. 02 would equally apply to Action No. 03

as well. Thus, if the Accused-Respondent chooses to place this as part of his explanation

(rather than the mere argument by Counsel) then the Court would be in a position to decide

whether it should accept this as an intentional action taken by the Accused-Respondent in the

discharge of his legal duty in his capacity as the Inspector General of Police.

Action No. 04

The writing that had been made by the Accused-Respondent on 21-04-2019 on the letters

produced, marked P 39, P 40 and P 41, form part of the claimed Action No. 04. At the outset,

two significant features in relation to these three pieces of information must be borne in mind.

The first significance is in the dates on which these pieces of information had been sent to

the Accused-Respondent. These dates are as follows: the Information No. 04 was sent to him

on 18-04-2019 (P 39); Information No. 05 was sent to him on 19-04-2019 (P 40); Information

No. 06 was sent to him on 20-04-2019 (P 41). The second significance is in the fact that

these information are the ones which had conveyed the specific reliable information to the

Accused-Respondent informing him of an imminent terrorist attack including the information

about those who were involved in planning the said attack.

Mr. Widura Ranawake making his submissions in respect of the action taken by the Accused-

Respondent on these pieces of information sent to him on 18-04-2019, 19-04-2019 and 20-

04-2019 relied on the minute which he says was written by the Accused-Respondent, dated

21-04-2019 which is the date of the incident of the bomb explosions relevant to this case.

Having drawn the said minute of the Accused-Respondent dated 21-04-2019 to the attention

of this Court, it was the position of Mr. Widura Ranawake that it was on 21-04-2019 that the

Accused-Respondent had received those documentation. He further submitted that according

to the pattern of the serial numbers which have been entered by the office of the Inspector

21 Record of proceedings on 26-11-2021 at 9.50 am (page 4), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 42 of 69

General of Police that all these letters have been received by the Accused-Respondent on 21-

04-2019. The minute made by the Accused-Respondent is to the following effect:

S.D.I.G/S.I.S Report progress by 05-05-2019

Highlighting the aforesaid minute, Mr. Widura Ranawake submitted that the Accused-

Respondent would not have made such a minute calling for a progress report by 05-05-2019

if he had received them after the incidents of bomb explosions. Mr. Widura Ranawake took

up the above position on the premise that one would expect some effective and lengthy

minute drafted in such a way to indicate that the Accused-Respondent had taken all necessary

measures within his means with a view to exonerate him from any possible responsibility for

any failure to act on those information, on his part. It was therefore the argument advanced

by Mr. Widura Ranawake that the above facts unequivocally indicate the fact that the Accused-

Respondent had received this documentation on 21-04-2019 before the bomb explosions

occurred.

It was at this moment of Mr. Widura Ranawakes submissions, when he was still on his feet,

that Senior Additional Solicitor General Mr. Priyantha Nawanna PC, could not restrain himself

from getting up on his feet to interject. Mr. Priyantha Nawanna PC, then proceeded to draw

the attention of the Court to the Admission No. 38, marked with the concurrence of both the

Accused-Respondent and the Prosecution. The said admission is as follows:

38 /

.22

Thus, in the light of the above Admission No. 38 that the Accused-Respondent had received

this information on the respective dates mentioned on those documents, I have to reject

outright, Mr. Widura Ranawakes submission, that the Accused-Respondent had in fact

received these documentation on 21-04-2019 after the bomb explosions relevant to this case.

The Court has to go on proven fact that the Accused-Respondent had indeed received this

documentation on the respective dates they are said to have been sent to him (according to

the Prosecution). Thus, the Accused-Respondent having received the information No. 04 on

22 Record of proceedings on 22-11-2021 at 10.05 am (pages 3-4), High Court-at-Bar Record of Proceedings, at Volume IV.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 43 of 69

18-04-2019, which is an information about the persons in relation to the incident of the dry-

run where a motorcycle was exploded in Kaththankudi on 16-04-2019, had waited until 21-

04-2019 only to write a minute to the S.D.I.G/S.I.S asking him to submit a progress report by

05-05-2019. It is only the Accused-Respondent who can explain this as it is only he who knows

under what circumstances he had made this minute and as to when he had made this minute.

Thus, I am of the view that the Accused-Respondent is obliged in law to explain these

circumstances (than mere argument by Counsel) if he is to assert that as part of an intentional

action taken by him, in the discharge of his legal duty in his capacity as the Inspector General

of Police of this country.

I also observe that in the case of Sinha Tissa Migara Ratnatunga v Hon. Attorney General,23

G. P. S. de Silva CJ did not think of interfering with the following observation made by the

learned High Court Judge in his Order deciding to call for the defence from the Accused in

that case. The said observation is reproduced below and clearly underline the importance of

the Accused giving an explanation rather than mere argument by his Counsel.

Where the words are prima facie defamatory, as in this case, and if the accused

intends to set up the defence that the words bore a non-defamatory sense and

assign some particular non-defamatory meaning to them (words) and allege the

special circumstances which he relies upon as supporting that (innocent)

meaning it is not enough for his counsel to merely say from the Bar that in the

circumstances in which they were published the words bear a non-defamatory

meaning. The stance of the learned Presidents Counsel in regard to these

matters is not as definite as one would have wished it to be and is as fluid as

fluid can be but what the learned defence counsel seem to be saying is that, if

I had understood him (or them) correctly, the writing in question represents

humorous, gently, light banter marked by pleasantry said more or less in jest

and not meant seriously or in earnest. Assuming that this is so, it is the writer

if he be the accused, who must say so in evidence or at least, in a statement

from the dock and not his counsel for a counsels submission do not attract to

itself the weight of evidence and cannot be treated as such.

Thus, in the above circumstances, I have to conclude that the High Court should have called

upon the Accused-Respondent to explain as to how he had treated the relevant eight pieces

23 SC (Spl) LA No. 336/1996 decided on 22-07-1996.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 44 of 69

of information which he had received. This is because in the absence of any explanation from

the Accused-Respondent, I am unable to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel

for the Accused-Respondent that those four actions must be taken as sufficient discharge of

the legal duty imposed upon the Accused-Respondent by law. I have to reiterate here that

the learned Counsel for the Accused-Respondent placed no other action before this Court for

consideration as actions taken by the Accused-Respondent.

The instant case is not a simple straightforward murder case. The charges have been based

on abetment by illegal omissions attributed to the Accused-Respondent. Thus, having regard

to the complexity and magnitude of this case, I am of the view that this is not a fit case in

which the learned High Court Judges should have acquitted the Accused-Respondent without

calling for his defence.

For the foregoing reasons, I have no basis to permit the Judgment of the High Court-at-Bar

to stand. Therefore, I set aside the Judgment dated 18-02-2022 pronounced by the High

Court-at-Bar. I hold that there are grounds for the High Court-at-Bar to proceed with the trial

and therefore direct the High Court-at-Bar to call upon the Accused-Respondent for his

defence and continue with the rest of the trial.

MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA, J.

I have had the privilege of reading the draft judgment of my brother, Justice Surasena, with

which I entirely agree.

This appeal concerns the correctness of the decision of the High Court Trial at Bar, made

under section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, in acquitting the

accused without calling for the defence immediately after the close of the prosecution case. I

must acknowledge that the correct application of section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, commonly referred to as the no case to answer application, is fraught with

difficulty and presents considerable complexity. This issue is not unique to Sri Lanka but

extends to many other jurisdictions with similar provisions. Hence, I decided to write a

separate opinion by way of emphasis and to provide further grounds for allowing this appeal.

Virtual end versus technical end

The general rule is that the Court shall take the decision to convict or acquit the accused after

the trial. There are two main exceptions to this general rule. The Court can acquit the accused:

(a) before the close of the prosecution case, and

(b) soon after the close of the prosecution case.

Before a case reaches its technical or formal end, it may come to a virtual end. This occurs

when the prosecution case has crashed, either during its presentation or through cross-

examination, leaving the prosecution without a case. If the prosecutor still persists, it

amounts to persecution rather than prosecution, as there is no purpose in flogging a dead

horse. If, for instance, in a rape case, no reasonable Court can accept the evidence of the

prosecutrix that the sexual act took place without her consent, there is no reason to wait until

the evidence of all prosecution witnesses is led to acquit the accused. The Court can acquit

the accused after the evidence of the prosecutrix. It is not a rule of law but a rule of practice

now hardened and crystallized into law.

The landmark case in which this rule was recognized is Pauline de Croos v. The Queen (1968)

71 NLR 169, decided over fifty-six years ago on 24.03.1968, where T.S. Fernando J. stated at

page 172:

The procedure actually adopted by the learned judge in this case is, to our knowledge,

not infrequently resorted to by judges in this Country when it becomes apparent to

the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and that there is no

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 46 of 69

purpose in flogging a dead horse. We ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the

development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical

end, to insist on technicality to the point almost of sanctifying it.

The Five Judge Bench decision of this Court in Attorney General v. Gunawardena [1996] 2 Sri

LR 149 at 158-159 illustrates the scope and applicability of this principle in the following

manner:

Section 212(2) of the Administration of Justice Law provides: When the case for the

prosecution is closed, if the Judge considers that there is no evidence that the Accused

committed the offence he shall direct the Jury to return a verdict of not guilty.

Under this provision the Judge can direct the Jury to return a verdict of not guilty only

at the close of the prosecution case. A practice appears to have developed in our

Courts of Judges stopping a case even before that stage is reached. This matter is

referred to in a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pauline de Croos v. The

Queen 71 NLR 169.

The procedure actually adopted by the learned Judge in this case, is to our knowledge,

not infrequently resorted to by Judges in this country when it becomes apparent to

the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and that there is no

purpose of flogging a dead horse. We ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the

development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical

end, to insist on technicality to the point of almost sanctifying it.

There is no reason to disagree with this dictum; if it is apparent to Court as well as to

counsel that to continue is to waste time and to flog a dead horse, the case should of

course be stopped. Again, if prosecuting counsel concedes or is constrained to admit

that all the evidence on which the prosecution case is based has been led and what

remains to be led is formal evidence or other supporting evidence which will not take

the case any further, then the virtual end of the prosecution case has been reached

and a court may fairly act under Section 212(2). But if there is such other evidence

still to be led on behalf of the prosecution which the Judge has to reckon and give

weight to in considering whether there is a case to go to the Jury, it appears to us that

a Judge will be acting contrary to S.212(2) in making a direction before he hears that

evidence.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 47 of 69

Nevertheless, some raise doubt as to whether this principle of terminating trials at their virtual

end applies only to jury trials, primarily because the Pauline de Croos case involved a jury

trial. In my view, this is a not correct.

When the Pauline de Croos case was decided in 1968, High Courts were non-existent, and

according to section 29 of the Courts Ordinance, the criminal sessions of the Supreme Court

were conducted before a judge and a jury. Following the establishment of High Courts with

the enactment of the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, section 193 mandated

that all trials before the High Court be tried by a jury before a judge. After the enactment of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, section 161 stipulated that all serious

offences were to be tried on indictment in the High Court by a jury. This provision was

amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, No. 11 of 1988, which provides

that all prosecutions on indictment in the High Court shall be tried by a judge unless the

accused elects to be tried by a jury. In practical terms, following this amendment in 1988, all

trials in the High Court are conducted before a judge alone, making jury trials virtually

obsolete.

The practice of stopping trials at their virtual, though not technical, end is equally applicable

to jury trials as well as non-jury trials. Over two decades ago, in Attorney General v. Baranage

[2003] 1 Sri LR 340, Justice Amaratunga affirmed this view, stating at page 352, This practice

is applicable not only to trials before a jury but also to trials by a judge without a jury.

If a judge in a jury trial can direct the jury to acquit the accused halfway through the

prosecution case on the basis that continuing with the trial is merely flogging a dead horse,

there is no reason why the same approach should not apply when the judge is deciding the

case alone, without a jury. It is crucial to maintain procedural integrity consistently across

both types of trials.

However, the Judge must not make this decision arbitrarily. He must act judicially, adhering

to the fundamental principles of natural justice. After the evidence of the main witnesses has

been led, if the Judge firmly forms the opinion that there is no reasonable prospect of proving

the charge against the accused, he should inform the prosecuting counsel of this in the

presence of the defence counsel and afford both parties an opportunity to be heard before

making a final decision.

In the United Kingdom, as a general principle, an accused cannot be acquitted before the

close of the prosecution case. However, in R v. N Ltd and Another [2008] 1 WLR 2684 at

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 48 of 69

2693, Lord Justice Hughes, delivering the judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, clarified

that such a course of action is permissible with the agreement of both parties:

That does not mean that it may not sometimes be appropriate and convenient for the

parties to agree to ask the Judge to rule as a matter of law whether on agreed or

admitted facts the offence charged is made out. A simple practical example is the

situation where the end of the Crown case is nigh, subject only to outstanding evidence

which it can be known will take a particular form, for example the police interviews. It

may be administratively convenient for the parties to ask, or for the Judge to suggest,

that an expected submission of no case be made then rather than half a day later,

perhaps so that the jury is not unnecessarily inconvenienced. The key point is that the

outstanding evidence is known for certain; it is admitted or agreed what it will be. And

although the argument may be taken at that point, and a ruling made, any direction

to the jury to return a verdict of not guilty ought ordinarily to await the end of the

Crown case, unless of course the Crown bows to the ruling and offers no further

evidence, as it might. Similarly, it may often happen that in advance of the calling of

any evidence at all the parties may agree that it would be helpful for the Judge to rule

upon the question whether, on agreed, admitted or assumed facts, the offence

charged would be made out. That may well be done with a view to the Crown accepting

that it may offer no evidence if the ruling is against it, just as it may be done with a

view to a defendant considering whether to plead guilty if the ruling is otherwise. The

difference from the power here claimed is that the Judge is invited to proceed upon

established, or assumed and agreed, facts, and has no power to compel acquittal until

the end of the Crown evidence.

Acquittal after the close of the prosecution case

After the close of the prosecution case, the Court may acquit the accused. If it is a trial by the

Judge, section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (which is identical

to section 210(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, No. 15 of 1898 and section 183(2) of the

Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973) is applicable, and if it is a Jury trial, section

220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (which is identical to section 234

of the Criminal Procedure Code, No. 15 of 1898 and similar to section 212 of the Administration

of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973) is applicable.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 49 of 69

This appeal pertains to the interpretation and applicability of section 200(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. The crux of the argument of learned Additional

Solicitor General was that the High Court Trial at Bar erred in law by acquitting the accused

after the close of the prosecution case by misapplication of section 200(1), even without an

application made on behalf of the accused to do so.

At the close of the prosecution case, and prior to the accused being called to present a

defence, the trial Judge may, either on the application of counsel or ex mero motu, acquit the

accused on the ground that there is no case to answer. An application on behalf of the accused

is not a mandatory prerequisite for making such a determination.

Section 200(1) reads as follows:

When the case for the prosecution is closed, if the Judge wholly discredits the evidence

on the part of the prosecution or is of opinion that such evidence fails to establish the

commission of the offence charged against the accused in the indictment or of any

other offence of which he might be convicted on such indictment, he shall record a

verdict of acquittal; if however the Judge considers that there are grounds for

proceeding with the trial he shall call upon the accused for his defence.

When the case for the prosecution is closed, section 200(1) permits the Judge to acquit the

accused on two main grounds:

(a) If he wholly disbelieves the evidence led by the prosecution or

(b) even if he wholly believes such evidence, if such evidence fails to establish the

commission of the offence charged in the indictment or of any other offence of which

he might be convicted on such indictment.

It further states:

(c) If, however, the Judge considers that there are grounds for proceeding with the trial

he shall call upon the accused for his defence.

It is clear that (a) and (b) above, favour the accused and (c) above favours the prosecution.

The test contained in (c) above, requires the Judge only to consider whether there are grounds

for proceeding with the trial. As Justice Salam points out in Jansen v. Attorney General [2015]

BLR 159, the words in (c) above grant the Judge greater discretion to continue with the trial.

My brother, Justice Surasena, endorses this view. I do not take a different view, but I must

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 50 of 69

stress that (a) and (b) above constitute the operative part of the section. If there is an

inconsistency within a section or a section with the other parts of the Act, the operative part

of the section shall take precedence and the other parts must give way to the operative part

of the section (Sunpac Engineers (Private) Limited v. DFCC Bank (SC/APPEAL/11/2021, SC

Minutes of 13.11.2023 at pages 20-25).

Total discredit of the evidence

Let me now turn to the operative part of section 200(1). If I may repeat, under (a) above, if

the Judge wholly discredits the evidence on the part of the prosecution, there is no need to

call for the defence. A partial disbelief is not sufficient; it should be a total disbelief.

As I stated previously, section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act relates to non-

jury trials, and section 220(1), which I have quoted below, applies to jury trials:

When the case for the prosecution is closed, if the Judge considers that there is no

evidence that the accused committed the offence he shall direct the jury to return a

verdict of not guilty.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his treatise, The Law of Evidence, Vol II, Book I, page 267 states

that the term no evidence has often been referred to as not a scintilla of evidence.

It may be on the rarest occasions that an indictment would be filed by the Attorney General

in the High Court without a scintilla of evidence. The Attorney General performs a quasi-

judicial function and is not tasked with securing convictions at any cost, but rather with

upholding the rule of law independently and impartially, ensuring the proper administration of

justice. However, there may be instances where the evidence presented by the Attorney

General is so grossly unreliable that no reasonable Judge or Jury could ever believe it. In such

cases, the accused shall be acquitted without calling for the defence.

The Attorney General v. Ratwatte (1967) 72 CLW 92 is a case where the judge has wholly

discredited the evidence for the prosecution. The 1st accused in that case, at the time of the

alleged offence, was the Private Secretary of the Prime Minister of Ceylon who was also the

Minister for Defence and External Affairs, responsible for decisions relating to the grant of

citizenship. The 1st accused was indicted for accepting a bribe of Rs. 5000 given in two

instalments for granting citizenship in terms of the Citizenship Act to a Malaysian national

whose visit visa had expired. The trial judge acquitted the 1st accused, concluding that no

reasonable Court could accept the testimony of the main witness. On appeal by the Crown,

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 51 of 69

T.S. Fernando J. (with the agreement of H.N.G. Fernando C.J.) affirmed the acquittal and

cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the trial Court:

But in my view no reasonable court can accept the oral testimony of Papuraj that this

gratification was given to the first accused. Here is a person holding a responsible post

under Government and one day in the afternoon on the 16th March 1964 an unknown

car drove up to the compound. The car contained some people unknown to him, one

of the persons possibly known to him there is no proof even of that fact walks up

to him who has by now come up to the parties and hands him quite openly Rs. 1000

which he accepts without any hesitation and he puts it into his shirt pocket. Similarly,

on the night of the 18th March 1964 an unknown car drives up to his house in this

case the ancestral walauwa of the 1st accused that the same person who on the

previous occasion is said to have given him Rs. 1000 walks up to him and the 1st

accused who has now come to the entrance of his house accepts this Rs. 4000 and

puts it his shirt pocket to be seen by the unknown persons in the car. On both

occasions the 1st accused does not appear to have been in anyway hesitant about

accepting the money. He does not appear to have been anxious to conceal the

acceptance from any person who may have seen it. He does not take the precaution

even of accepting the money without being seen by the unknown persons. It cannot

be said that he is unaware of the seriousness of the offence he is committing. He does

not seem to care as to whether he is led into a trap or not. I do not think any ordinary

person would accept a bribe in such a manner, least of all a person in the position of

the 1st accused who holds such a responsible post under Government.

In interpreting section 234(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of 1898, which was

identical to section 220(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of 1979, the Court of Criminal

Appeal in The Queen v. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529 at 555 made the crucial distinction

between (a) the establishment of an offence by evidence and (b) the decision that there is no

evidence that the accused committed the offence. According to the Court of Criminal Appeal,

while the former is a question of fact that must be left to the Jury, the latter is a question of

law that must be decided by the Judge.

Lastly, there is the question whether the learned trial Judge should have given a

direction to the jury at the close of the case for the prosecution under section 234(1)

to return a verdict of not guilty. That section casts a duty upon the trial Judge to direct

the jury to acquit, if he is of opinion that there is no evidence that the accused has

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 52 of 69

committed an offence. This provision is in accordance with the principle underlying a

criminal trial by judge and jury that matters of law are for the Judge to decide and

matters of fact for the jury. It does not appear to us to be a departure from that

principle. It has always been considered that the question whether there is no evidence

upon an issue is a question of law. Thus, in cases where an appeal is given on a matter

of law, a plea that there was no evidence to support a determination is always

permitted to be raised as a question of law. Whether there is sufficient evidence or

whether the evidence is reasonable, trustworthy or conclusive, or, in other words, the

weight of evidence is a question of fact. Accordingly, the Judge has to decide whether

there is evidence upon the different matters which the prosecution has to prove in

order to establish the guilt of the accused. It is for the jury to decide whether those

matters are proved by such evidence and guilt established. Thus, in a case, which the

prosecution seeks to prove by direct evidence, the Judge has to decide whether there

is evidence upon the different matters required to be proved to establish the

commission of the offence and the jury has to decide whether it believes that evidence

and whether the evidence accepted by them establishes those matters to their

satisfaction. In a case of circumstantial evidence, the Judge has to decide whether

there is evidence of facts from which it is possible to draw inferences in regard to the

matters necessary to establish the guilt of the accused. It is for the jury to decide what

facts are proved and whether it is prepared, in the circumstances, to draw from them

inferences in regard to guilt and whether in all the circumstances those inferences are

the only rational inferences that may be drawn or are irresistible inferences.

Failure to establish the commission of the offence

The second ground for acquittal as embodied in section 200(1) is that such evidence fails to

establish the commission of the offence charged against the accused in the indictment or of

any other offence of which he might be convicted on such indictment. This means that even

if the evidence presented is wholly reliable, if it does not establish the essential elements

necessary for a conviction on (a) the charge in the indictment, or (b) any other offence for

which the accused might be convicted on such indictment, the accused should be acquitted.

Standard of proof

The next question, which is the most challenging, concerns not the onus of proof but the

standard of proof expected from the prosecution at the close of its case. There is no explicit

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 53 of 69

provision setting out the applicable legal standard for a no case to answer application.

Therefore, it is necessary to determine an appropriate legal standard that aligns with the

statutory framework and the principles governing the burden of proof.

Throughout the trial, the burden remains on the prosecution to prove the charge against the

accused beyond reasonable doubt, and it never shifts. In the celebrated House of Lords

decision of Woolmington v. DPP [1935] AC 462 at 481, Viscount Sankey L.C., with the

concurrence of Lord Hewart L.C.J., Lord Atkin, Lord Tomlin and Lord Wright, recognized this

principle as the golden thread running through the fabric of criminal law.

At this juncture, it may be appropriate to briefly clarify the meaning of proof beyond

reasonable doubt, a standard that has historically perplexed both prosecutors and judges due

to its lack of a precise definition. The classic definition of proof beyond reasonable doubt is

widely regarded as that of Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions [1947] 2 All ER 372,

where he stated at page 373:

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of doubt.

The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect

the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence of course it

is possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt,

but nothing short of that will suffice.

Justice Kodagoda in Sivathasan v. Attorney General [2021] 2 Sri LR 290 at 304-305

emphasized that a reasonable doubt is a real, substantial doubt arising from objective

consideration of the facts, not an imaginary or flimsy one:

A reasonable doubt is a real or actual and a substantial doubt, as opposed to an

imaginary or flimsy doubt that may arise in the mind of the decider of facts (judge or

the jury, as the case may be), following an objective consideration of all the attendant

facts and circumstances. It is a doubt founded on logical and substantial reasoning

(well-founded) which a normal prudent person with not less than average intelligence

and learnedness in men, matters and worldly affairs, would naturally and inevitably

develop in his mind following a comprehensive, objective, independent, impartial and

neutral consideration of the totality of the evidence and associated attendant

circumstances. It is a doubt that makes the case for the prosecution significantly less

probable to have occurred than in the manner purported to have occurred.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 54 of 69

A reasonable doubt is not the type of doubt that arises due to incorrect, abnormal or

unreasonable comprehension of testimonies and other material which amount to

evidence presented at the trial, or due to irrational fear, inappropriate sympathy, or

unjustifiable mercy. It is not a doubt that develops in the mind of an imbecile,

indecisive or timid person, or in a weak or vacillating mind. A shadow of a doubt, an

imaginary doubt, a vague doubt or a speculative or trivial doubt should not be confused

with a reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt is not a doubt that a partisan individual

with vested interests would entertain in his mind, or a doubt that such a person would

advocate that purportedly exists.

As this Court held in Karunarathna v. OIC, Police Station, Rambukkana (SC/APPEAL/61/2023,

SC Minutes of 09.10.2024 at page 20):

The prosecution must prove the accuseds guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not

beyond any doubt. A reasonable doubt refers to a doubt based on logical reasoning

through proper evaluation of evidence. This requires the trier of fact to weigh all

evidence supporting guilt against evidence suggesting innocence, considering the

strengths and weaknesses on both sides. If, after this evaluation, the evidence

overwhelmingly favors the prosecution and eliminates any reasonable doubt about the

guilt of the accused, the case can be deemed proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This

standard applies to the totality of the evidence as a whole, not to each individual piece

of evidence the prosecution relies on to prove the guilt of the accused.

It is also important to point out that there can be degrees of proof within the standard of

proof of beyond reasonable doubt. The degree of proof must be commensurate with the

occasion and proportionate to the subject-matter. This aspect was discussed by this Court in

LOLC Factors Limited v. Airtouch International (Private) Limited (SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015,

SC Minutes of 03.04.2024).

In Bater v. Bater [1950] 2 All ER 458, the wife sought for divorce against the husband on the

ground of cruelty. The trial judge held that she must prove her case beyond reasonable doubt.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed it. Denning L.J. stated at page 459:

The difference of opinion which has been evoked about the standard of proof in these

cases may well turn out to be more a matter of words than anything else. It is true

that by our law there is a higher standard of proof is required in criminal cases than in

civil cases, but this is subject to the qualification that there is no absolute standard in

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 55 of 69

either case. In criminal cases the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt,

but there may be degrees of proof within that standard. Many great judges have said

that, in proportion as the crime is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear. So also

in civil cases. The case may be proved by a preponderance of probability, but there

may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree depends on the

subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require

a higher degree of probability than that which it would require if considering whether

negligence were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court,

even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require a

degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion. Likewise, a divorce

court should require a degree of probability which is proportionate to the subject-

matter.

As explained by the International Criminal Court in The Prosecutor v. William Samoei Ruto

and Another (Case No. ICC-01/09-01/11, decided on 03.06.2014), the primary rationale

underpinning the acquittal on the basis of no case to answer is the principle that an accused

should not be called upon to answer a charge when the evidence presented by the prosecution

is substantively insufficient to engage the need for the defence to mount a defence case. This

reasoning flows from the rights of an accused, including the fundamental rights to a

presumption of innocence and to a fair and speedy trial, which are reflected in Articles 66(1)

and 67(1) of the [Rome] Statute.

Prima facie case or case proven beyond reasonable doubt?

By quoting Attorney General v. Baranage [2003] 1 Sri LR 340 at 354 and Sinha Ranatunga v.

The State [2001] 2 Sri LR 172 at 188-189, Mr. Widura Ranawake, learned counsel for the

former Inspector General of Police strenuously submitted with his characteristic eloquence

that at the stage of the closure of the prosecution case, the standard of proof required of the

prosecution is proof beyond reasonable doubt. I must accept that I was initially more inclined

to accept this position during the course of the argument.

In Attorney General v. Susantha Kumara (HCC/0055/22, CA Minutes of 24.11.2022),

Kaluarachchi J. stated:

At the stage of deciding whether the accused should be called upon for his defence, it

is not necessary to consider whether there is evidence to prove the charge beyond a

reasonable doubt. However, at the very least, there must be some evidence on each

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 56 of 69

element of the offence to call the defence, because an offence would not be

constituted if there is no evidence of one of the basic elements required to prove the

charge.

In Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de Silva (1967) 70 NLR 169 at 173, H.N.G. Fernando C.J.

acknowledged that what needs to be established at that stage is a prima facie case.

The question of the standard of proof required from the prosecution at the close of its case is

indeed contentious and remains a subject of considerable debate, extending beyond local

jurisprudence. After careful and prolonged consideration, I regret that I am unable to concur

with the submission of Mr. Widura Ranawake.

There is no duty cast on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable

doubt at the close of its case. At the stage of the close of the prosecution case, the proper

question for the Court to consider is whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie case

to call upon the accused for his defence, not whether the prosecution has proved the case

beyond reasonable doubt. The decision whether the accused is guilty of the charge beyond

reasonable doubt should be reserved until the conclusion of the entire trial.

The next question is what is the meaning of prima facie case? There is a difference between

prima facie case and prima facie evidence. Sarkers Law of Evidence, Vol I, 14th edition (1993),

page 45 defines prima facie evidence as evidence which, if accepted, appears to be sufficient

to establish a fact unless rebutted by acceptable evidence to the contrary. It is not conclusive.

In Ex parte Minister of Justice, re R v. Jacobson & Levy (1931) A.D. 466, Statford J.A. states

that Prima facie evidence in its usual sense is used to mean prima facie proof of an issue,

the burden of proving which is upon the party giving that evidence. In the absence of further

evidence from the other side, the prima facie proof becomes conclusive proof and the party

giving it discharges his onus.

If the same yardstick is applied to a prima facie case, it would imply that a prima facie case

is one made out by the prosecution on evidence which, if unrebutted, would warrant the

conviction of the accused. However, I find this definition unacceptable for a prima facie case

as contemplated under section 200(1).

After the Court calls for the defence on the basis that the prosecution has established a prima

facie case, if the accused remains silent and closes the defence case, the Court cannot

automatically enter a conviction. The Court has a duty thereafter to meticulously reassess and

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 57 of 69

reconsider the entirety of the evidence as a separate exercise in determining the guilt of the

accused, applying the beyond reasonable doubt standard. The decision to call for the defence

has no bearing on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution throughout the trial.

In Sinha Ranatunga v. The State (supra) at page 189, Yapa J. in the Court of Appeal stated

that in an application for no case to answer under section 200(1), A prima facie case

necessarily means a case beyond reasonable doubt at first sight i.e. on the evidence

available on record as at the close of the prosecution case. With respect, I find myself unable

to accept this definition. A Prima facie case and proof beyond reasonable doubt are two

different and irreconcilable concepts. Prima facie is a Latin term which means at first sight.

Prima facie evidence is neither conclusive nor irrefutable. A prima facie case may not stand or

fall by itself.

At the close of the prosecution case, it is not prudent to consider whether the prosecution has

proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt, as this could undermine a fundamental principle

of the criminal justice system that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

This presumption extends not only until the conclusion of the prosecution case but persists

until the entire trial is completed, ensuring that both parties are given the opportunity to be

heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice. However, if no prima facie case is

established against the accused, he is entitled to an early acquittal. If proof beyond reasonable

doubt were to be accepted as the standard at the close of the prosecution case, then, should

the accused choose to remain silent after the defence is called, it would necessarily lead to an

automatic conviction.

Lord Parker C.J. (with the concurrence of Ashworth and Fenton Atkinson JJ.) elucidated the

applicable test at the close of the prosecution case in his Practice Directions reported in

[1962] 1 All ER 448 as follows:

Those of us who sit in the Divisional Court have the distinct impression that justices

today are being persuaded all too often to uphold a submission of no case. In the

result, this court has had on many occasions to send the case back to the justices for

the hearing to be continued with inevitable delay and increased expenditure. Without

attempting to lay down any principle of law, we think that as a matter of practice

justices should be guided by the following considerations.

A submission that there is no case to answer may properly be made and upheld: (a)

when there has been no evidence to prove an essential element in the alleged offence;

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 58 of 69

(b) when the evidence adduced by the prosecution has been so discredited as a result

of cross-examination or is so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal could

safely convict upon it.

Apart from these two situations a tribunal should not in general be called upon to reach

a decision as to conviction or acquittal until the whole of the evidence which either

side wishes to tender has been placed before it. If, however, a submission is made

that there is no case to answer, the decision should depend not so much on whether

the adjudicating tribunal (if compelled to do so) would at that stage convict or acquit

but on whether the evidence is such that a reasonable tribunal might convict. If a

reasonable tribunal might convict on the evidence so far laid before it, there is a case

to answer.

It is essential to recognize that the quality of the evidence is not evaluated at the mid-trial

stage. If sufficient evidence exists to warrant the continuation of the trial, the Court must treat

this evidence as reliable, call upon the defence, and defer a comprehensive evaluation of the

evidence until the conclusion of the entire case to determine whether the prosecution has

established its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

In State of Kerala v. Mundan (1981) CRILJ 1795 at paras 8 and 8A it was held:

We are of the view that the words no evidence in Section 232 Cr.P.C. [in India]

cannot be construed or interpreted to mean absence of sufficient evidence for

conviction or absence of satisfactory or trustworthy, or conclusive evidence in support

of the charge. The judge has to see whether any evidence has been let in on behalf

of the prosecution in support of their case that the accused committed the offence

alleged, and whether that evidence is legal and relevant. It is not the quality or the

quantity of the evidence that has to be considered at this stage. If there is any evidence

to show that the accused has committed the offence, then the judge has to pass on

to the next stage. It is not open to him to evaluate or consider the reliability of the

evidence at this stage.It is a salutary principle in a sessions trial that no final opinion

as to the reliability or acceptability of the evidence should be arrived at for the Judge

until the whole evidence before him and has been duly considered.

What is expected from the prosecution at the end of the prosecution case and what is expected

from the Judge at the end of the whole case was lucidly explained by Dixon C.J., Webb,

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 59 of 69

Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ. on behalf of the High Court of Australia in May v. OSullivan

(1955) 92 CLR 654 at page 658:

When, at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is

no case to answer, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it

stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands

he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless there is some

special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a case to answer has

no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning

to end. After the prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support proof of the

issue, the defendant may or may not call evidence. Whether he does or not, the

question to be decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the whole of the

evidence before it, it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.

This is a question of fact. In deciding this question it may in some cases be legitimate,

as is pointed out in Wilson v. Buttery (1926) SASR 150 for it to take into account the

fact that the defendant has not given evidence as a consideration making the inference

of guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe than it might otherwise

possibly appear: cf. Morgan v. Babcock & Wilcox, per Isaacs J. (1929) 43 CLR 163 at

178. But to say this is a very different thing from saying that the onus of proof shifts.

A magistrate who has decided that there is a case to answer may quite consistently,

if no evidence is called for the defendant, refuse to convict on the evidence for the

prosecution. The prosecution may have made a prima facie case, but it does not

follow that in the absence of a satisfactory answer the defendant should be convicted.

The Court of Appeal judgment in Attorney General v. Baranage (supra) is largely founded on

the seminal judgment of the Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom in R. v. Galbraith [1981]

1 WLR 1039 decided on 19.05.1981. It was a Jury trial. At the close of the prosecution

evidence, a submission was made that there was no case for the accused to answer, which

the Judge rejected. The principal ground of appeal was that the Judge had erred in this regard.

Lord Lane C.J. articulated the test at page 1042 as follows:

How then should the judge approach a submission of no case? (1) If there is no

evidence that the crime alleged has been committed by the defendant, there is no

difficulty. The judge will of course stop the case. (2) The difficulty arises where there

is some evidence but it is of a tenuous character, for example because of inherent

weakness or vagueness or because it is inconsistent with other evidence, (a) Where

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 60 of 69

the judge comes to the conclusion that the prosecution evidence, taken at its highest,

is such that a jury properly directed could not properly convict upon it, it is his duty,

upon a submission being made, to stop the case. (b) Where however the prosecution

evidence is such that its strength or weakness depends on the view to be taken of a

witnesss reliability, or other matters which are generally speaking within the province

of the jury and where on one possible view of the facts there is evidence upon which

a jury could properly come to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty, then the

judge should allow the matter to be tried by the jury. It follows that we think the

second of the two schools of thought is to be preferred.

There will of course, as always in this branch of the law, be borderline cases. They can

safely be left to the discretion of the judge.

After reviewing the evidence, Lord Lane C.J. concluded that the trial judges decision to call

for the defence was correct.

The Galbraith directions, however, do not support the proposition that the standard for

assessing a no case to answer submission is that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

After quoting the Galbraith directions, Blackstones Criminal Practice (2017), Oxford University

Press, page 1813 states:

The following propositions are advanced as representing the position that has now

been reached on determining submissions of no case to answer:

(a) If there is no evidence to prove an essential element of the offence, a submission

must obviously succeed.

(b) If there is some evidence which, taken at face value, establishes each essential

element, the case should normally be left to the jury.

(c) If, however, the evidence is so weak that no reasonable jury properly directed

could convict on it, a submission should be upheld. Weakness may arise from the

sheer improbability of what the witness is saying, from internal inconsistencies in

the evidence or from its being of a type which the accumulated experience of the

courts has shown to be of doubtful value.

(d) The question is whether a witness is lying is nearly always one for the jury, save

where the inconsistencies are so great that any reasonable tribunal would be

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 61 of 69

forced to the conclusion that it would not be proper for the case to proceed on the

evidence of that witness alone.

The Privy Council judgment in the case of How Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor [1981] 2 MLJ 49

is a landmark judgment on the question of no case to answer, which was delivered on

22.06.1981, one month after the Court of Appeal judgment in R v. Galbraith. The Privy Council

judgment stemmed from three appeals from the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore.

Section 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore, at that time, read as follows:

When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the

accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an

order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.

Section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Malaysia also was drafted in identical terms.

Although prima facie reading of this section suggests that the case must have been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt at the close of the prosecution case, the Privy Council in How Tua

Tau v. Public Prosecutor did not endorse such an interpretation. Lord Diplock with the

agreement of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, Lord Scarman, Lord Roskill and Sir Ninian Stephen

held:

The proper attitude of mind that the decider of fact ought to adopt towards the

prosecutions evidence at the conclusion of the prosecutions case is most easily

identified by considering a criminal trial before a judge and jury, such as occurs in

England and occurred in Singapore until its final abolition capital cases in 1969. Here

the decision-making function is divided; questions of law are for the judge, questions

of fact are for the jury. It is well established that in a jury trial at the conclusion of the

prosecutions case it is the judges function to decide for himself whether evidence has

been adduced which, if it were to be accepted by the jury as accurate, would establish

each essential element in the alleged offence: for what are the essential elements in

any criminal offence is a question of law. If there is no evidence (or only evidence that

is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person could accept it as being true) to

prove any one or more of those essential elements, it is the judges duty to direct an

acquittal, for it is only upon evidence that juries are entitled to convict: but, if there is

some evidence, the judge must let the case go on. It is not the function of the jurors,

as sole deciders of fact, to make up their minds at that stage of the trial whether they

are so convinced of the accuracy of the only evidence that is then before them that

they have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. If this were indeed their

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 62 of 69

function, since any decision that they reach must be a collective one, it would be

necessary for them to retire, consult together and bring in what in effect would be a

conditional verdict of guilty before the accused had an opportunity of putting before

them any evidence in his defence. On the question of the accuracy of the evidence of

any witness jurors would be instructed that it was their duty to suspend judgment until

all the evidence of fact that either party wished to put before the court had been

presented. Then and then only should they direct their minds to the question whether

the guilt of the accused had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

In their Lordships view the same principle applies to criminal trials where the combined

roles of decider of law and decider of fact are vested in a single judge (or in two judges

trying capital cases). At the conclusion of the prosecutions case what has to be decided

remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether

there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept as

accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such

evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only,

is he justified in finding that no case against the accused has been made out which if

unrebutted would warrant his conviction, within the meaning of section 188(1).

Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence,

and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the

prosecutions witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the

accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have

addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may

wish to advance.

In Malaysia, doubts were expressed regarding the correctness of this judgment,

notwithstanding that it was delivered by the Privy Council. These concerns were addressed by

the Seven Judge Bench of the Federal Court of Kuala Lumpur in the case of Arulpragasan

Sandaraju v. Public Prosecutor (1996) 4 CLJ 597, where it was held (with one Judge

dissenting) that the standard of proof required of the prosecution at the close of its case is

proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and if the accused elects to remain silent and calls no

witnesses in his own defence, the Court must convict him without further ado. This decision

was in conflict with the Privy Council decision.

However, the matter did not rest there. Doubts were expressed regarding the correctness of

this judgment. As a result, the Seven-Judge Bench decision was effectively overruled in the

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 63 of 69

following year by the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code in Malaysia in 1997, which

explicitly stated that the standard of proof at the end of the prosecution case is a prima facie

case, while the standard of proof at the conclusion of the trial is beyond reasonable doubt.

180. (1) When the case for the prosecution is concluded, the Court shall consider

whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the accused.

(2) If the Court finds that the prosecution has not made out a prima facie case against

the accused, the Court shall record an order of acquittal.

(3) If the Court finds that a prima facie case has been made out against the accused

on the offence charged the Court shall call upon the accused to enter on his defence.

(4) For the purpose of this section, a prima facie case is made out against the accused

where the prosecution has adduced credible evidence proving each ingredient of the

offence which if unrebutted or unexplained would warrant a conviction.

182a. (1) At the conclusion of the trial, the Court shall consider all the evidence

adduced before it and shall decide whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

(2) If the Court finds that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable

doubt, the Court shall find the accused guilty and he may be convicted on it.

(3) If the Court finds that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable

doubt, the Court shall record an order of acquittal.

Section 230(1)(j) of the Criminal Procedure Code in Singapore (revised edition 2012) states

that if after considering the evidence referred to in paragraph (e), the court is of the view

that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and

every element of the charge as framed by the prosecutor or as altered or framed by the court,

the court must call on the accused to give his defence.

The International Criminal Court, in the case of The Prosecutor v. William Samoei Ruto and

Another (supra) holds the same view:

23. As an initial point, a distinction needs to be made between the determination made

at the halfway stage of the trial, and the ultimate decision on the guilt of the accused

to be made at the end of the case. Whereas the latter test is whether there is evidence

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 64 of 69

which satisfies the Chamber beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused,

the Chamber recalls that the objective of the no case to answer assessment is to

ascertain whether the Prosecution has led sufficient evidence to necessitate a defence

case, failing which the accused is to be acquitted on one or more of the counts before

commencing that stage of the trial. It therefore considers that the test to be applied

for a no case to answer determination is whether or not, on the basis of a prima facie

assessment of the evidence, there is a case, in the sense of whether there is sufficient

evidence introduced on which, if accepted, a reasonable Trial Chamber could convict

the accused. The emphasis is on the word could and the exercise contemplated is

thus not one which assesses the evidence to the standard for a conviction at the final

stage of a trial.

24. The determination of a no case to answer motion does not entail an evaluation

of the strength of the evidence presented, especially as regards exhaustive questions

of credibility or reliability. Such matters which go to the strength of evidence rather

than its existence are to be weighed in the final deliberations in light of the entirety

of the evidence presented.

Let me summarize the applicability of section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of

1979. At the end of the prosecution case, if the Judge wholly, as opposed to partly, disbelieves

the evidence led by the prosecution, i.e., no reasonable Judge would act upon such evidence,

the accused shall be acquitted. This is articulated in the first part of section 200(1). If there

exists, on prima facie basis, some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if accepted by

the Judge as accurate, would establish the essential elements of the offence charged in the

indictment or any other offence of which the accused might be convicted on such indictment,

the Judge shall call for the defence. This is addressed in the second part of section 200(1). If

the Judge decides against the prosecution in either of these two instances, the Judge need

not call for the defence but shall acquit the accused, unless there are other grounds for

proceeding with the trial as referred to in the last part of section 200(1).

Strong and cogent evidence

In the majority judgment, the phrase strong and cogent evidence ( )

is used repeatedly with special emphasis, highlighting the required standard of proof. I have

no doubt that the Trial at Bar anticipated a high degree of proof from the prosecution by the

end of its case. I do not for a moment say that the approach adopted is consciously wrong

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 65 of 69

and the majority deliberately or knowingly resolved to ignore the settled law regarding

standard of proof expected at the close of the prosecution case. In my view, the law was not

settled at the time of the delivery of the impugned order of the Trial at Bar.

As Justice Surasena has pointed out, the case at hand is not an ordinary murder or attempted

murder case to be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. It is a very complicated high-

profile trial where for the first time in our history, an Inspector General of Police was indicted

by the Attorney General to impute criminal liability on illegal omissions. There was, and still

is, a public outcry that those in authority, including the accused, failed to take action despite

being well aware in advance of the series of suicide attacks launched on Easter Sunday in

2019. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry presided over by a sitting Supreme Court Judge

made recommendations regarding criminal prosecutions. In fundamental rights applications

filed by the victims of this carnage, the Supreme Court held several persons liable for violating

their fundamental rights and ordered heavy compensation. I make these observations not to

suggest that trial Judges should consider extraneous matters when deciding whether to call

for the defence, but rather to highlight the challengeespecially in a case of such complexity

and magnitudeof arriving at accurate findings without the benefit of counsels assistance

from both parties.

Questions of fact

The major part of the judgment of the Trial at Bar is set apart to say that the accused has

taken adequate steps to prevent suicide attacks whereas the prosecution version is that the

steps alleged to have been taken by the accused are grossly inadequate. That is not a question

of law but a question of fact which should be decided at the end of the trial, not at the end

of the prosecution case. While my view is provisional and not binding, I concur with Justice

Surasena that the accused did not take adequate steps that he could or ought to have taken

to prevent the suicide attacks. I do not wish to elaborate on this aspect further, given the final

conclusion reached by Justice Surasena, with which I entirely agree.

If I may stress what Justice Surasena has already stated, in Samy and Others v. Attorney

General (Bindunuwewa Murder Case) [2007] 2 Sri LR 216 at 239 what Justice Weerasuriya

stated was if the officer in charge has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of

his ability, he cannot be faulted for the action he has taken even though it may appear that

another course of action could have proved more effective in the circumstances. It is within

the knowledge of the accused that he performed his duties and exercised his discretion bona

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 66 of 69

fide and to the best of his ability. Who can explain this? Only the accused can explain this,

not the counsel or the Judge. This opportunity was denied to the accused by the Trial at Bar.

The Trial at Bar did not even invite the learned counsel to explain this.

Intention

The Trial at Bar has also taken the view that the prosecution has failed to prove intention on

the part of the accused as required by section 100 of the Penal Code by strong and cogent

evidence ( ). In addition to the defence taken up by learned counsel for

the former Inspector General of Police that adequate steps were taken to prevent the suicide

attacks, his other principal defence was grounded in the absence of intention on the part of

the accused. It is true that in terms of section 100 of the Penal Code A person abets the

doing of a thing who intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.

Intention is an essential ingredient in proving the offence. Learned Additional Solicitor General,

in his written submissions, has cited several foreign legal authorities to argue that intention

can be imputed when the accused foresees the result of his illegal omissions as virtual

certainty. The relationship between knowledge and intention in a charge of abatement by

illegal omission has also been a subject of considerable debate.

In my view, the question of intention was not seriously and adequately addressed at the

argument before us; the primary focus was on the adequacy and inadequacy of the steps

taken by the accused to prevent the suicide attacks. The question of intention is not a pure

question of law to be raised for the first time on appeal. It is a mixed question of fact and law.

The question of intention was not explicitly raised as a distinct issue before the Trial at Bar.

There was no opportunity for the Attorney General to make submissions before the Trial at

Bar regarding the question of intention or any other matter. Therefore, the Trial at Bar did

not have the advantage of hearing both parties before it decided that there was no intentional

aid on the part of the accused by illegal omission that enabled the suicide bombers to launch

the attacks.

The Trial at Bar has simply gone on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove that the

omission was intentional. For the Trial at Bar, it was so obvious. When something is obvious,

we tend to refuse to afford a fair hearing stating that hearing makes no difference as the end

result would be the same. This is a misguided notion. A fair hearing could uncover critical

insights and perspectives that were not initially apparent. Megarry J. in John v. Rees [1970]

Ch 345 at 402 elucidated this point as follows:

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 67 of 69

As everybody who has anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is

strewn with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of

unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered; of inexplicable

conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable determinations that, by

discussion, suffered a change.

In light of the final conclusion reached by Justice Surasena, with which I concur, I shall refrain

from exploring the question of intention further in this judgment. Let the Trial at Bar first

decide the question of intention by calling for the defence and hearing counsel for both parties.

Alternative charges

There is another important matter trial Judges tend to overlook when an application under

section 200 is made. At the close of the prosecution case, the Judge must consider not only

whether there is prima facie evidence to call for the defence in respect of the offence charged

in the indictment, but also whether there is prima facie evidence to call for the defence in

respect of any other offence for which the accused might be convicted on the indictment. The

phrase the accused might be convicted indicates that there need not be strong and cogent

evidence on any other offence.

The Trial at Bar ex mero motu considered section 298 of the Penal Code as an alternative

charge and rejected it, but learned Additional Solicitor General stated that the accused at least

might have been convicted under some other section, such as section 112 of the Penal Code.

As Justice Surasena points out, the majority judgment has seriously fallen into an error when

they evaluated the facts of the case in light of section 107 of the Penal Code whereas the

accused was charged under section 102 read with sections 296 and 300 of the Penal Code.

These obvious mistakes could have been avoided if the Trial at Bar took the decision after

hearing counsel for both parties.

Hearing after the close of the prosecution case

The gravamen of the complaint of learned Additional Solicitor General was that the Trial at

Bar acquitted the accused without affording the Attorney General an opportunity to be heard.

Conversely, Mr. Widura Ranawake, learned counsel for the accused submitted that there is no

legal requirement in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to afford a hearing once the

prosecution has closed its case and before the Court decides whether to call for the defence.

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 68 of 69

In some jurisdictions it is mandatory to hear both sides before taking a decision on no case

to answer. For instance, in India, section 232 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 states:

If, after taking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing

the prosecution and the defence on the point, the Judge considers that there is no

evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Judge shall record an order of

acquittal.

While accepting that there is no such express provision in our Code of Criminal Procedure Act

requiring to afford a hearing at that stage, I must state that there is no prohibition either

against inviting counsel for both parties to address the Court, particularly when the Court is

considering acquitting the accused in a complex case of this nature. As stated by Tambiah J.

in Hevavitharana v. Themis de Silva (1961) 63 NLR 68 at 72, quoting with approval the famous

dictum of Mahmood J. in Narasingh Das v. Mangal Dubey (1883) 5 Allahabad 163 at 172:

Courts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as

prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse principle

that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to be prohibited

by the law. As a matter of general principle prohibition cannot be presumed.

If a statute is silent on the requirement to afford a hearing to the party who will be affected

by a decision, the Court will imply a rule within the statutory provision that the principles of

natural justice are observed. Procedural fairness demands such a course of action to be

followed. In Gamini Dissanayake v. M.C.M. Kaleel and Others [1993] 2 Sri LR 135 at 179 this

Court observed that today the courts presume, unless the contrary appears, that the

legislature intended that powers conferred by it be exercised fairly, for although there are no

positive words in a statute, requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the

common law will supply the omission of the legislature. (William Wade, Administrative Law,

11th Edition (2014), page 377, De Smiths Judicial Review, 8th Edition (2018), page 392, J.A.L.

Cooray, Constitutional and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka, 1st Edition (1973), page 333)

In the UK case of Barking and Dagenham Justices, ex parte DPP (1995) 159 JP 373, it was

held that when the justices are provisionally inclined to uphold a submission of no case to

answer, they must first invite the prosecution to address the Court. This procedure ensures

that the prosecutor has the opportunity to argue why the case should not be dismissed. In R

v. Brown [1998] Crim LR 196, the Court of Appeal held that if, at the end of the evidence, the

trial judge considers that no reasonable jury properly directed could safely convict, he should

[SC TAB 03/2023] Page 69 of 69

raise the matter for discussion with counsel even if no submission of no case to answer is

made. If, after considering the submissions, the judge still holds this view, he should

withdraw the case from the jury.

I agree with the final conclusion of Justice Surasena that the impugned order of the Trial at

Bar dated 18.02.2022 must be set aside and the case remitted to call for the defence.
