In such a situation, such participation may result in the commission of the offence jointly by the two participants and therefore attract liability jointly for committing the actus reus and entertaining the corresponding mens rea of the offence. Practically, in most such instances, both participants may have acted jointly in furtherance of their common intention. In the alternative, there could be a perpetrator who appears to be the primary participant of the crime (referred to as the \u2018principal offender\u2019) and another offender who is linked to the commission of the crime through his participation in a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention with the principal offender. In both these situations, it would not be possible to invoke the principle of individual criminal liability, and therefore the culpability of both such persons who acted in furtherance of a common intention need to be combined and thereafter individually applied to both perpetrators. Then, criminal liability becomes common to both participants in crime.",

In the aftermath, section 34 of the Indian Code is verbatim section 32 of the Ceylon Penal Code. Thus, in my view, when interpreting section 32 of the Code, special attention must be given to the inclusion of the term \u2018in furtherance of the common intention of all\u2019. [In the form of a postscript, I must add that the Penal Code of India was repealed in 2023 by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (No. 45 of 2023) which came into effect on 1st July 2024. Section 3(5) of the Sanhita also provides that \u2018when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone\u2019.

Each of such person who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with the requisite knowledge or intention. Section 34 provides that whenever the causing of a certain effect or an attempt to cause that effect by any act or omission is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. Section 35 provides that when an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Thus, it is necessary to appreciate that section 32 is not the only provision of law which is applicable to situations where more than one accused is alleged to have acted jointly in committing an offence. Nevertheless, I shall not engage in a discussion regarding the principles of law embodied in these sections, as it is unnecessary to the determination of this Appeal. Since the majority decision in Attorney-General vs. Munasinghe and Others [70 NLR 241], it is well accepted that since section 32 lays down only a principle of criminal liability (as opposed to defining an offence), a reference to that section in the charge would not be necessary. Yet, making a reference to sections 32, 33, 34 and 35 is in my view not unnecessary, since often when considering criminal responsibility of more than one person who is alleged by the prosecution to have jointly committed the substantive offence, the application of the principles of law contained in these sections is overlooked and is therefore neglected by the trial court. In fact, it is almost never that one comes across an instance where the Honourable Attorney-General frames a case for the prosecution founded upon the legal principles contained in sections 33, 34 or 35 of the Penal Code. However, it is pertinent to note that the principles contained in sections 32, 33, 34 and 35 are distinct and different. Nevertheless, there may be situations where the legal principles contained in more than one of these sections would be applicable to the same set of facts. Therefore, in my opinion, in instances where there is more than one person accused of having committed an offence jointly, it would be desirable for the prosecutor to draw the attention of court to the applicable principles of law contained in sections ranging from 32 to 35 of the Penal Code.",

Should the combined acts constitute the actus reus of the offence they are alleged to have committed, then the law provides for the \u2018imputation\u2019 of such combined actus reus individually on all such participants. This view is evident in Chief Justice Basnayake\u2019s elucidations in The Queen vs. Mahatun [61 NLR 540 at 546], where His Lordship has expressed the view that when a criminal act is committed by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of each of such other persons, all of them are liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. If each of the several persons commits a different criminal act, each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, then, each of them is liable for each such act as if it were done by him alone. Nevertheless, for such imputation to take place, in situations where there has been a principal perpetrator and another purported participant in the commission of the offence, there must be some conduct (as opposed to mere presence at the crime scene) on the part of such other person on whom liability is sought to be invoked under section 32, and such conduct must be in furtherance of the common intention shared with the principal perpetrator. It is this feature of section 32 that is referred to as \u2018participatory presence\u2019. In Wasalamuni Richard and two Others vs. The State [76 NLR 534] the majority Judgment of Justice Alles reveals clearly the approach taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal that evidence of \u2018participatory presence\u2019 as opposed to \u2018mere presence\u2019 was an indispensable requirement to invoke liability under section 32 of the Penal Code. It is also noteworthy that in Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasiri and Others vs. W.M.M. Kumarahamy and the Honourable Attorney-General [SC TAB 02/2012, Supreme Court Minutes of 2nd April 2014] Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane, at p.47, has specifically looked for the existence of \u2018participatory presence\u2019 and formed the view that the 4th Accused-Appellant in that case was not merely present at the crime scene but engaged in certain illegal acts in furtherance of the common intention. Similarly, in Kalanchidewage Suresh Nandana vs. Honourable Attorney General [SC Appeal",

I find myself in agreement with Her Ladyship and His Lordship, since that approach is in consonance with the ingredient of section 32 which requires action on the part of those accused on whom criminal culpability is sought to be invoked under section 32, on the premise that they not only shared a common intention, but each one of them also acted \u2018in furtherance of the common intention of all\u2019 as opposed to merely being present at the scene of the crime.",

This being the principle, it is clear \u2026 that common intention within the meaning of section 34 of the Indian Penal Code implies a pre-arranged plan and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case. \u2026 Care must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common intention; the partition which divides \u201ctheir bounds\u201d is often very thin; nevertheless, the distinction is real and substantial, and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice. \u2026 the inference of common intention within the meaning of the term in section 34 should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case.\u201d [Emphasis added by me. Section 34 of the Penal Code Act of India is identical to section 32 of the Penal Code of Ceylon.] Different as well as common portions of these views have been endorsed by Acting Chief Justice Soertsz presiding in the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King vs. Ranasinghe [47 NLR 373] and by Chief Justice Howard presiding in the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King vs. Piyadasa [48 NLR 295]. Furthermore, the common intention entertained by the person whose culpability is being considered must have been for the commission of the specific offence which the principal offender (doer of the act) in fact committed. Therefore, as seen in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen vs. Gopalapillai and Another [61 NLR 160], when the common intention was that the principal doer of the act would commit one offence and he in fact committed another offence, the accused who entertained only the common intention would not be liable for such other offence unexpectedly and suddenly committed by the principal doer.",

To the contrary, the existence of common intention in all probability implies possible pre-arrangement between the multiple participants in the crime. Therefore, should there be evidence of pre-arrangement, it would support the prosecution\u2019s case theory that the accused who participated in the pre-arrangement entertained a common intention at the time of committing the substantive offence. Thus, in such circumstances, the court / jury would not be hesitant to arrive at an inferential finding that at the time of the commission of the offence, the accused whose liability is being considered, entertained a common intention with the doer of the act (principal offender) as regards the commission of the substantive offence. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Justice Gunasekera in Anthony vs. The Queen [55 NLR 35] a common intention does not necessarily and in all cases imply an express agreement and a plan arranged long before the commission of the offence. The agreement which resulted in the formation of the common intention may be tacit and the common design conceived immediately before it is executed. A common intention can come into existence without pre-arrangement. Theoretically, one cannot exclude the possibility of a \u2018common intention\u2019 having been formed in the \u2018spur of the moment\u2019 soon prior to the substantive offence being committed. To hold that a \u2018common intention\u2019 within the meaning of section 32 necessarily implies the existence of a pre-arranged plan, would unduly restrict the scope of the section and introduce an element which it does not contain. However, it is imperative for the Court or the Jury to consider as to how else than through pre-arrangement of some sort or any other form of communication between the accused (which may even include non-verbal communication) the \u2018common intention\u2019 came into existence.",

    "text": "merely remains at the scene of the crime without committing any act in furtherance of such common intention, then such presence per-se at the scene of the crime would be insufficient to invoke liability under section 32. In The Queen vs. Vincent Fernando and Others [65 NLR 265 at 272] Chief Justice Basnayake has observed that a person who merely shares the criminal intention or takes a fiendish delight in what is happening, but does no criminal act in furtherance of the common intention of all, is not liable for the acts of the others. This observation in my view further clarifies His Lordship\u2019s view regarding this matter contained in the earlier decided case of The Queen vs. Mahatun [61 NLR 540 at 548]. Therefore, to be liable under section 32, a mere sharing of the minds of an intention which is common to them would not be sufficient. The sharing of the common intention must be given effect to by some action in furtherance of the common intention. The Penal Code does not make punishable a mental state however wicked it may be, unless it is accompanied by a criminal act which manifests the state of mind. It is this principle that has given rise to the common phraseology \u2018participatory presence\u2019 (also known as \u2018actual participation\u2019 or \u2018participation in action\u2019). In several cases including in Girija Shankar vs. State of Uttar Pradesh [2004 AIR (1) SC 1808] and Mrinal Das and Others vs. State of Tripura [(2011) AIR (4) SC 3753], the Supreme Court of India has held the view that liability under section 34 (which is equivalent to section 32 of the Penal Code of Ceylon) cannot be invoked without both ingredients of (a) common intention and (b) actual participation of accused in the commission of that offence (participatory presence) being satisfied. Therefore, it is observable that actual participation in the offence as opposed to mere presence is one of the two ingredients that has to be satisfied in order to invoke liability under section 32 of the Penal Code. In this regard, as expressed by former Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud and V.R. Manohar in the treatise titled \u201cRatanlal & Dhirajlal\u2019s The Indian Penal Code\u201d (30th edition, reprint 2009 at page 35) \u201cbefore a man can be held liable for acts done by another, under the provisions of this section, it must be established that (i) there was common intention \u2026 and (ii) the person sought to be so held liable had participated in some manner in the act constituting the offence\u201d and that \u201cunless common intention and participation are both present this section cannot apply\u201d. Further, as also stated by N.D. Basu in his commentary on the \u201cIndian Penal Code\u201d (10th edition, 2009, Volume I at page 99), participation in action to commit an offence with common intention is an essential element and the court must arrive at a finding as to the part played by each",

Therefore, it is inferentially possible to only arrive at a finding that the 1st and the 3rd Accused had through pre-arrangement developed a common intention to commit the several offences they were indicted of having committed. Such pre-arrangement between the 1st and 3rd Accused and their participation in the commission of the substantive offence would not be items of evidence applicable against the 2nd Accused (Appellant).

    "text": "key submission made by learned Senior ASG. His argument was that the Appellant having fled away from Delana (possibly along with the 1st and 3rd Accused) on the night of the incident, not resided at his house for quite some time, absconded and having subsequently surrendered, supports the inference that he (the Appellant) shared a common murderous intention together with the other two Accused. First, one needs to consider the relevancy of these items of evidence. It is common and quite popular in our criminal justice system to treat such evidence as \u2018subsequent conduct influenced by the fact in issue\u2019 and therefore deemed \u2018relevant\u2019 under section 8(2) of the Evidence Ordinance. At first sight, it is quite so. However, given the other evidence of this case, one needs to carefully consider whether such subsequent conduct was in fact \u2018influenced by the facts in issue\u2019 (the complicity of the Appellant in the commission of the crime) or was influenced by the fact that other peasants of this township of Delana had assumed that all three Accused had participated in the dastardly murder of Neelawathi, and therefore that night caused mischief by setting fire to the houses of all three Accused. Given a degree of vigilantism which at times prevail in our society in instances where there is considerable public disquiet as a reaction towards the commission of serious crimes, where segments of the community acting illegally assume the role of the police (law enforcement) and the courts (judiciary), and apprehend and summarily punish alleged perpetrators and proceed even to the extent of causing mischief to their property, had the Appellant remained in the village of Delana, in all probability he would have been harmed alongside damage being caused to his house. Therefore, as explained in his testimony, the Appellant having initially returned to Delana from Kuliyapitiya and thereafter fled the area, lay in hiding and later surrendered, in my view is quite understandable. Such conduct on the part of the Appellant cannot in my view be necessarily attributed to his complicity in the crimes committed by the 1st and 3rd Accused.",

I would find myself in disagreement with that approach taken by the learned Judge of the High Court. From the principles of law enunciated in the earlier mentioned judgments, it would be seen that for the purpose of determining whether or not the 2nd Accused entertained a common murderous intention, while the fact that the three Accused entered the compound together is relevant, the other two considerations would not justify a rational inference to be reached as regards the existence or the absence of a common intention. Furthermore, the learned Judge of the High Court has concluded that the prosecution has proven that there was a pre-arrangement between the three Accused to commit the crime. I see no evidence which would justify that finding. iii. The learned Justice of the Court of Appeal has in fact and quite rightly considered the case of the 2nd Accused \u2013 Appellant separately. Furthermore, he has considered whether the presence of the 2nd Accused at the scene of the crime was a \u2018participatory presence\u2019. Firstly, the learned Justice does not appear to have appreciated the fact that, particularly given the possible distance between the hedge fence and the house, standing near the hedge fence cannot be necessarily interpreted as standing at the exact scene of the crime. The learned Justice appear to have reached the conclusion that the presence of the 2nd Accused amounted to a \u2018participatory presence\u2019 by virtue of his having remained near the fence throughout the period the crime was committed and his having looked \u2018here and there\u2019. In my view, while the learned Justice of the Court of Appeal was entitled to take these items of circumstantial evidence into consideration, they do not give rise to a safe, irresistible and inescapable inference that the 2nd Accused (Appellant) entertained a common intention together with the 1st and the 3rd Accused towards the commission of the offences they in fact committed. iv. Neither of the learned Judges appear to have given credence to the conduct of the 2nd Accused (Appellant) that merely 30 minutes prior to the gruesome incident, he attempted to peacefully resolve the dispute that had arisen between the 1st and the 3rd Accused on the one hand and Premasinghe on the other.",
