"In [1978] vol. 48 Company Cases page 378 (Bomb.)- United Western"
"Ltd, In re., the High Court of Bombay set out the underlying principles"
"on winding up of companies as follows;"
"“On a petition under section 483 of the Companies Act, 1956,"
"where the defence is that the debt is disputed, the court has to"
"see  first  whether  the  dispute  on  the  face  of  it  is  genuine  or"
"merely a cloak to cover the company’s real inability to pay just"
"debts.  The  inability  is  indicated  by  its  neglect  to  pay  after  a"
"proper demand and a lapse of three weeks. Such neglect must"
"be  judged  on  the  facts  of  each  case.  Merely  seeking  to  raise"
"certain disputes for putting off liability for payment of the debt"
"or creating a kind of defence to the claim will not make the debt"
"a disputed one. Disputes which appear to have been created or"
"manufactured for the purpose of creating pleas to cover up the"
"liability for payment of the debt can never be considered to be"
"bona  fide  and  will  be  of  no  avail  in  resisting  a  winding-up"
"petition.”"
