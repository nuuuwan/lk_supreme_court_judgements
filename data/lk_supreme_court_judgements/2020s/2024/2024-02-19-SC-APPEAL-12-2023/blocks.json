The inability is indicated by its neglect to pay after a proper demand and a lapse of three weeks. Such neglect must be judged on the facts of each case. Merely seeking to raise certain disputes for putting off liability for payment of the debt or creating a kind of defence to the claim will not make the debt a disputed one. Disputes which appear to have been created or manufactured for the purpose of creating pleas to cover up the liability for payment of the debt can never be considered to be bona fide and will be of no avail in resisting a winding-up petition.",
