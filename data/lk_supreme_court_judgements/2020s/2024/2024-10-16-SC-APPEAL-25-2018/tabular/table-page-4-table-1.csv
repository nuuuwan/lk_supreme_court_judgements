"05. The trial judge in this instant case, whilst holding that the plaintiff had established"
"its title to the land in suit, vide P1 the deed, nevertheless accepted that the defendants"

"06. Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  the  plaintiff  went  before  the  High  Court.The"
"learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court  held,  that  the  case  of  the  plaintiff  being  a"
"declaration of title, the plaintiff failed to establish the chain of title to the land. The"
"learned  judges  scrutinized  the  deed  P1  and  especially  its  recitals  and  came  to  the"
"finding that the plaintiff does not have exclusive title to the land in suit. Thus, based"
"on case law, the High Court held that the plaintiff has failed to establish its title as"
"required by law relating to a rei vindicatio action and therefore, varied the answers"
"given by the trial judge to three issues, pertaining to plaintiff’s title to the land in"
"dispute to read as ‘not proved’."

"Court  held,  that  the  trial  judge  had  carefully  analyzed  the  oral  and  documentary"
"evidence before court and had considered the matter on a judicious perspective and"
"had come to the finding that the defendants acquired prescriptive title to the land in"
"suit."
"0
9. Therefore, the High Court held that there is no reason to interfere with such decision"
"of  the  trial  court  and  dismissed  the  appeal  without  costs,  subject  however,  to  the"
"variation of the answers given to three issues as referred to earlier and thereby held"
"that the plaintiff has failed to establish title to the land in suit."
"10. In summary, the High Court held that the plaintiff failed to establish its title and that"
"the trial judge correctly held that the defendants had acquired prescriptive title to the"
"land in dispute, viz, 29/11, Pangiriwatta Road, Mirihana."
