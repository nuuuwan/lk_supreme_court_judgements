"Further, the Appellant relied upon Pathirana v. Jayasundara (Supra) regarding privity"
"of contract and Luwis Singho v. Ponnamperuma (Supra) in respect of possessory remedy to"
"justify its stance. The Appellant also drew our attention to the Court of Appeal judgement of"
"Ruberu and another v. Wijesooriya (1998) 1 SLR 58 where it was observed;"
"“Whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is"
"foreign to a suit in ejectment against either. The licensee obtaining"
"possession is deemed to obtain it upon the terms that he will not"
"dispute  the  title  of  him  without  whose  permission,  he  would  not"
"have got it. The effect of operation of Section 116 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title under"
"which he is in occupation he must first, quit the land.”;"
