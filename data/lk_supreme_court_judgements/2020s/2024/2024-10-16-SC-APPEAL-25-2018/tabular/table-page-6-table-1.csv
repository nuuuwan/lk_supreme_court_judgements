"Thus, an applicant for a rei vindicatio action ought to have a real right in the property."
"As dominus he has the right of possession and occupation of the property against all the world,"
"a right in rem, save and so far as he has parted with his right to such possession and occupation."
"T
hus,  the  requisites  of  a  rei  vindicatio  action  is  that  the  plaintiff  is  the  owner  of  the"
"property and the property is in the possession of the defendant."
"Our courts have constantly held that when the defendant is in possession of the land in"
"dispute,  the  burden  is  on  the  plaintiff  to  prove  that  he  has  dominum.  [Ref.  Wanigaratne  v."
"Appuhamy  65  NLR  167;    Peeris  v.  Saunahamy  54  NLR  207;    Abeykoon  Hamine  v."
"Appuhamy 52 NLR 49 and  De Silva v. Goonetileke 32 NLR 217]"
"Our court have been unanimous in holding that dominum or ownership is proved though"
"the chain of title running into many years or as far as you could remember, and the burden or"
"the onus probandi is on the plaintiff to prove dominum."
"Based  upon  the  above  proposition  in  the  instant  appeal,  the  plaintiff  should  prove"
"ownership. As discussed earlier, the trial judge relying only upon the deed P1 executed in 1972,"
"came to the finding that the plaintiff has established dominum."
"The learned Judges of the High Court reversed such finding after carefully analyzing the"
"contents of P1, the only title deed marked in evidence and the oral evidence led before court. It"
"is a matter of interest, that the plaintiff failed to lead evidence of the purported indenture and"
"the resolution passed by the plaintiff institution in 1972 and the evidence of Kandaiah or any"
"other trustee of the plaintiff institution. Thus, for reasons stated in the judgement, the learned"
"judges of the High Court came to the finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish title and"
"specifically,  exclusive  title  to  the  land  in  suit,  the  contention  put  forward  at  the  trial  by  the"
"plaintiff."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant submitted before us, that the action"
"filed in the District Court was not a rei vindicatio action but a declaratory action. Thus, it was"
"contended  that  it  was  not  necessary  to  establish  title  through  a  chain  of  title  and  P1  would"
"suffice."
"Further, it was contended, even if the Appellant obtained only the rights of the trustee"
"Kandaiah, (as contended by the Respondents since, the recitals in P1, refer to ‘Kandaiah and"
"another’  having  title)  that  the  plaintiff  becomes  a  co-owner  of  the  land  and  capable  of"
"vindicating its rights. The learned Counsel relied upon Hewawitharana v. Dangan Rubber"
"Co. 17 NLR 49 to put forward this argument. The learned Counsel also relied upon Pathirana"
"v. Jayasundara 58 NLR 169 and the Court of Appeal judgement in Luwis Singho and others"
"v. Ponnamperuma (1996) 2 SLR 320 to justify, that in an action for a declaration of title and"
"ejectment, the plaintiff need not sue by right of ownership but could do so, by right of possession"
"and ouster as well."
