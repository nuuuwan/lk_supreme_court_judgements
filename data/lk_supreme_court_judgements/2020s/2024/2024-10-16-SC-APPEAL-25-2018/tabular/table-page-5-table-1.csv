"The Appeal before the Supreme Court"
"Having referred to the factual matrix of this Appeal, let me now move onto consider the"
"questions of law raised before this Court. The first question relates to acquisition of prescriptive"
"title by the defendants and the second, the title of the plaintiff itself."
"Plaintiff’s title"
"I
 wish to consider the 2nd question of law raised before this Court first i.e., Plaintiff’s"
"title to the land in suit."
"F
rom the facts narrated earlier, there is no ambiguity that the only title deed produced"
"before the trial court was P1, a deed executed in 1972 wherein the plaintiff claimed title to the"
"land in suit. The defendants claimed uninterrupted and undisturbed possession, adverse to none,"
"for more than 30 years."
"T
he plaintiff instituted the instant matter in the District Court of Mount Lavinia in the"
"year 2005."
"Prior to the institution of this case, a Section 66 application pertaining to the land in suit"
"was filed in the year 2003. According to the evidence led at the trial, there had been no disputes"
"or  disturbances  between  the  parties  until  the  year  2003.  The  land  in  suit  lies  next  to  the"
"defendants residence. The plaintiff institution, is located away from the land in suit."
"B
y  the  plaint  filed  in  the  District  Court,  the  plaintiff  claimed  a  declaration  of  title,"
"ejectment  and  damages  until  the  plaintiff  is  restored  to  possession.  These  reliefs,  reflect  all"
"elements  underpinning  an  application  for  a  rei  vindicatio  action.  However,  in  the  written"
"submissions  filed  before  this  Court,  the  plaintiff  appears  to  distance  himself  from  the  said"
"proposition and contend that the instant application is a pure and simple ‘declaratory action’."
"T
he  nature  and  scope  of  a  vindicatory  action  has  been  discussed  and  analysed  in"
"judgements  and  by  text  book  writers  here  and  in  other  jurisdictions,  for  many  years  and  a"
"plethora of judicial dicta has evolved pertaining to same."
"T
here is no doubt that the rei vindicatio action is the major remedy conferred by the"
"Roman-Dutch Law on an owner who had been deprived of his property. The jus vindicandi, or"
"the  right  to  gain  possession  of  one’s  property,  is  a  significant  attribute  of  ownership  in  the"
"Roman-Dutch Law."
