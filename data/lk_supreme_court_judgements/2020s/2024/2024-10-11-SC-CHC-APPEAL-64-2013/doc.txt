The Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) entered into a lease agreement (Lease Agreement)

with one Galolu Kankanamlage Buddhika Amarajeewa (Lessee) in terms of which the

Respondent purchased vehicle bearing No. 63-0807 and leased it to the Lessee.

The 1st Defendant-Respondent (1st Defendant) and the 2nd Defendant-Appellant

(Appellant) entered into what is termed a Guarantee and Indemnity (Guarantee), jointly

and severally guaranteeing the punctual payment by the Lessee to the Plaintiff of all rent

interest and all other sums whatsoever due under the Lease Agreement.

The Lessor defaulted in the payment of rent due in terms of the Lease Agreement. The

Plaintiff referred the dispute for arbitration as agreed. The sole arbitrator made an award

in favour of the Plaintiff. The award was enforced by the High Court. However, it could

not be executed.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff filed this action against the 1st Defendant and the Appellant. Trial

proceeded ex parte against the 1st Defendant. The learned High Court Judge entered

judgment in favour of the Plaintiff against both the 1st Defendant and the Appellant.

The Appellant has raised the following points in appeal:

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that despite a decree been

entered by the High Court in favour of the Plaintiff against the Lessee allowing the

Plaintiff to recover the amount due under the Lease Agreement, the Plaintiff has

instituted this action against the Guarantors without pursuing the said decree;

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the obligation of the

Guarantors is to indemnify the losses of the Plaintiff and the failure on the part of

the Plaintiff to recover the amount due under the said decree has resulted in the

liability of the 1st Defendant and Appellant being unjustly increased;

Page 4 of 21

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the attempt of the Plaintiff

to recover the amount due under the Lease Agreement from the 1st Defendant and

Appellant demanding the same after Nine Years and One Month from the date of

the termination of the Lease Agreement would inevitably be an unjust enrichment

especially in view of the fact that at the termination of the Lease Agreement, the

amount due was only Rs. 2,236,728.39 whereas by the alleged demand the Plaintiff

has demanded Rs. 9,450,732/= from the 1st Defendant and Appellant;

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the unexplained delay on

the part of the Plaintiff to take steps against the 1st Defendant and Appellant has

been for the benefit of the Plaintiff, especially in view of the fact that at the

termination of the Lease Agreement, the amount due was only Rs. 2,236,728.39

whereas by the alleged demand, the Plaintiff has added further interest and

demanded Rs. 9,450,732/- from the 1st Defendant and Appellant. This cannot be

permitted in law since this attempt of the Plaintiff is in violation of the well-

established principle that one cannot take advantage of his own wrongful act;

5. The learned High Court Judge has failed to address the issue regarding prescription

from the correct perspective;

6. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the Plaintiff, who without

executing the decree against the Lessee, had slept over its rights and thus not

entitled to maintain this action against the 1st Defendant and Appellant.

These issues must be examined based on the applicable law of the Guarantee. In Peoples

Bank v Nizam and three Others [S.C. (C.H.C.) Appeal No. 05/2007, S.C.M. 02.08.2024], I

had the opportunity to consider the applicable law in relation to a guarantee given in

favour of a bank by a party as a part of a banking transaction.

Page 5 of 21

Although our common law is the Roman-Dutch law, in view of Section 3 of the

Introduction of Law of England Ordinance, No. 5 of 1852 (Civil Law Ordinance), all

questions or issues with respect to the law of banks and banking, the law to be

administered shall be the same as would be administered in England in the like case.

In Peoples Bank [supra.], the impugned transaction was part of a banking transaction.

Hence that transaction was most closely connected with English law, which led me to

conclude that the governing law is English law after applying the relevant conflict of law

rule, i.e. the system of law with which the transaction was most closely connected.

However, the impugned transaction is not part of a banking transaction and will be

governed by Roman-Dutch law.

The Guarantee uses the terms surety, guarantee and indemnity. Hence, I wish to begin by

setting forth some general principles in Roman-Dutch law on surety, guarantee and

indemnity and the differences between them which are material to the determination of

this appeal.

Contract of Suretyship

The contract of suretyship is a contract whereby one party binds himself to be answerable

for the debt of another person and has its origins in Roman Law. This contractual

relationship was established by three methods, namely the verbal contract (stipulatio),

the mandate and constitutum debiti.

According to Lee [The Elements of Roman Law, IV ed., Seventh Impression (1997,

Reprinted in 2007, page 298] stipulatio consisted essentially in a formal question and

answer. One party (stipulator or reus stipulandi) said to another (reus promittendi), e.g.,

Do you promise to give me one thousand sesterces?. The other said I promise. This

Page 6 of 21

concluded the contract and gave rise to a legal obligation on the part of the promissor to

do what he had promised.

The verbal contract (stipulatio) took three different forms depending on the form of

words used by the stipulator (creditor) to the intended surety. The words were either

idem dari spondes, idem fidepromittis or idem fide tua esse jubes? The ensuing contracts

were referred to as sponsio, fide-promissio and fidejussor and the surety referred to as

sponsor, fidepromissor and fidejussor. The only remaining type of verbal suretyship by the

time of Justinian was fidejussio.

Suretyship was also created by Mandatum whereby the surety gave a mandate, known

as mandatum credendae pecuniae, to the creditor to lend to the debtor resulting in the

creditor being able to proceed against the surety by the actio mandati contraria should

he fail to recover the money from the debtor.

Constitutum debiti was the third method by which suretyship was created in Roman Law.

This was based on an informal promise.

In the early stages of its development in Roman Law, the liability of the surety was not

merely secondary but primary in nature. Hence the creditor was able to, if he so chooses,

proceed against the surety before even demanding from the surety. Overtime this

position was changed by practice or legislation.

The changes to the benefit of the surety were made through the benefits of cession of

action, division and of order.

Benefit of cession of actions (beneficium cedendarum actionum) involved the transfer of

the rights of action to the surety which the creditor had against the debtor. It appears

that from the early days of the Empire, there existed the practice for surety to demand

Page 7 of 21

cession of actions as a condition precedent to satisfying the claim of the creditor. This

gave the surety recourse of action against the debtor and any other co-sureties.

Benefit of division (beneficium divisionis) is the right of a surety to claim that his liability

should be limited to a proportionate share of the debt [Grotious 3.3.28; Voet 46.1.21; Van

Leeuwen CF1.4.17.28]. It was possible for a surety to renounce this benefit expressly or

impliedly [Voet 46.1.24; Grotious 3.3.29].

Justinian provided a surety with the Benefit of Order or Excussion (beneficium ordinis seu

excussionis) which required the creditor to first proceed against the debtor, if within the

jurisdiction. Where the debtor was not, the surety was granted time by the judge to

produce him, failing which the surety was exposed to action by the creditor.

This benefit of excussion was not available where:

(a) The debtors estate was sequestrated [Grotious 3.3.27; Voet 46.1.15.17; Gaha v.

Ordra Trust and Investments (Pty) Ltd 1954 (2) SA 129(T)] or in the case of a

company, in liquidation [Bank of Africa v. Hampson (1884) 3 HCG 1].

(b) The surety failed to plead the benefit before litis contestatio [Grotious 3.3.29; Voet

46.1.15].

(c) The surety has expressly [Grotious 3.3.29; Voet 46.1.16] or impliedly renounced

the benefit.

The contract of suretyship is part of Roman-Dutch law as well. Voet [Voet 46.1.1] states

a surety is one who by a stipulation takes upon himself the obligation of another, whilst

the latter, the principal debtor, remains bound. This definition was approved in

Malmesbury Board of Executors and Trust Co v. Duckitt and Bam [1924 CPD 101 at 108].

Page 8 of 21

The reference by Voet to stipulation as the basis of entering into a contract of suretyship

highlights the cardinal principle in Roman law that parties must come together for the

conclusion of the contract. This requirement is affirmed in the Institutes of Justinian

where it is said that no verbal contract can be validly concluded without the presence of

the parties (item verborum obligatio inter absentes concepta inutilis est).

Van der Linden [1.14.10] defines suretyship as a contract by which a person binds himself

on behalf of a debtor, for the benefit of the creditor, to pay him the whole or part of what

the debtor owes him, thus joining in the obligation.

According to Grotius [3.3.12], a surety is one who, for greater security of the debt, binds

himself by promise in favour of another principal debtor.

Van Leeuwen in Censura Forensis [1.4.17.3] states suretyship is an accessory obligation,

by which a person, by means of a stipulation, pledges his credit on anothers obligation,

the principal debtor still remaining bound.

These jurists unite in reinforcing one fundamental characteristic of a contract of

suretyship in Roman-Dutch law, namely that the contract of suretyship establishes an

accessory obligation to the principal obligation and has no independent existence. One of

the earliest cases to emphasise this attribute of a contract of suretyship is Fitzgerald v.

Argus Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd. [(1907) 3 Buch AC 152 at 159]. Hence, there cannot

be any suretyship unless there is in existence a valid principal obligation. In the absence

of it, the suretyship is void [Imperial Cold Storage and Supply Company Limited v. Julius

Weil and Co. 1912 AD 747 at 750].

Subsequently, several decisions have sought to provide a finite definition of a contract of

suretyship. Innes C.J. in Corrans and Another v. Transvaal Government and Coulls

Trustee [1909 TS 605 at 612] held that the undertaking of the surety is accessory to the

main contract, the liability under which he does not disturb, but it is an undertaking that

Page 9 of 21

the obligation of the principal debtor will be discharged, and, if not, that the creditor will

be indemnified. This was cited with approval in Hutchinson v. Hylton Holdings and

Another [1993(2) SA 405(T) at 410H].

In Union Government v. Van der Merwe [1921 TPD 318 at 321], Wessels J.P. expounded

the institute of suretyship and its incidents as follows:

The contract of suretyship presupposes a principal obligation which has the same

object, in the sense used by Continental jurists, as the contract of the surety. This is

expressed by the maxim una eadem res vertitur in obligatione. Troplong,

Cautionnement, sec.22. The legal scope of the suretys contract is identical with

that of the principal debtor --- accessorium sui principalis naturam sequitur. The

surety undertakes the same obligation as the debtor, and undertakes to perform

this same obligation so soon as the debtor, when called upon, fails to perform it.

Troplong, caut:46. It is true there are two contracts, the one between the creditor

and the debtor and the other between the creditor and the surety. But the contract

between the creditor and the surety is not an independent contract with an

obligation of its own but an accessory contract with the very same obligation that

exists between the principal debtor and the creditor. Although it is true that the

suretyship contract may be entered into by an agreement different to that of the

principal contract, yet immediately the surety agrees to become such, whether by

a written or a verbal agreement, then his contract with the creditor is of the same

nature as that of the principal debtor, because it becomes accessory to it, or is, as

it were, absorbed by it. (emphasis added)

Page 10 of 21

Caneys The Law of Suretyship [Forsyth & Pretorius (eds.), 5th edition (Juta & Co. Ltd.,

2002), page 27] sought to provide a definition of suretyship as:

[] an accessory contract by which a person (the surety) undertakes to the creditor

of another (the principal debtor), primarily that the principal debtor, who remains

bound, will perform his obligation to the creditor and, secondarily, that if and so

far as the principal debtor fails to do so, he, the surety will perform it, or failing

that, indemnify the creditor.

This definition of a contract of suretyship has been approved in Trust Bank of Africa Ltd

v. Frysch [1977 (3) SA 562 (A) at 584F]; Sapirstein & Others v. Anglo African Shipping Co.

S A Ltd [1978 (4) SA 1 (A) at 11H]; Nedbank Ltd v. Van Zyl [1990 (2) SA 469]; Basil Read

(Pty) Ltd v. Beta Hotels (Pty) Ltd. and Others [2001 (2) SA 760(C) at 766F].

However, this definition has been critiqued by Stegmann, J. in his dissenting judgment in

Carrim v. Omar [(2001) 4 All SA 691 at 698C] on the basis that an undertaking that the

principal debtor will perform his obligation is not necessary to the existence of suretyship.

In Orkin Lingerie Co. (Pty) Ltd v. Melamed and Hurwitz [(1963) 1 SA 324 (W) 326], Trollip,

J. provided an ordinary meaning of a contract of suretyship. He held that:

[] a contract of suretyship in relation to a money debt can be said to be one

whereby a person (the surety) agrees with the creditor that, as accessory to the

debtors primary liability, he too will be liable for that debt.

The essence of suretyship is the existence of the principal obligation of the debtor

to which that of the surety becomes accessory.

Page 11 of 21

In view of the existence of diverse definitions, it is not possible to provide a universally

accepted general definition of what is meant by a contract of suretyship. Nevertheless,

the fundamental feature is that in a contract of suretyship, the obligation of the surety is

accessory to the principal obligation of the debtor and not an independent obligation.

Difference between Contract of Suretyship and Contract of Guarantee

According to Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. I, page 190], contracts which

charge a person with the debt, default or miscarriage of another are contracts of

suretyship or guarantee. He appears to proceed on the basis that suretyship and

guarantee are interchangeable.

Indeed, many writings and judicial decisions do reflect this understanding [See Caneys

The Law of Suretyship, 1st and 2nd editions; Walter Perera, Laws of Ceylon, Vol. II, page

629; Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millet, Law of Guarantees [6th ed. (Thomson Reuters,

2011), page 271]; Institutes of Holland, Van Der Linden, Translation by Henry Juta, (3rd

ed., 1897), Chapter XIV, Section X; Institutes of Holland, Van Der Linden, Translation by J.

Henry, (1828), Chapter XIV, Section X. See also, Mouton v. Die Mynwerkersunie (1977(1)

SA 119(A) at 136B); Hazis v. Transvaal and Delagoa Bay Investment Co Ltd. (1939 AD

372 at 384); Hermes Ship Chandlers (Pty) Ltd v. Caltex Oil (SA) Ltd. (1973 (3) SA 263 (D)

at 266-7); IIG Capital LLC v. Van Der Merwe and Another (2008) EWCA Civ 542, para. 19;

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. v Peoples Bank (2017) B.L.R. 206].

However, Courts have also held that the word guarantee is open to a number of

meanings and its meaning when used in a specific document depends on the context in

which it is used. In Walkers Fruit Farms Ltd v. Sumner [1930 TPD 394 at 398], Greenberg,

J. held that the ordinary meaning is to assure a person of the receipt or possession of

something. In Dempster v. Addington Football Club (Pty) Ltd. [1967(3) SA 262(D) at 267]

and Cazalet v. Johnson [1914 TPD 142 at 145] it was held to mean pay.

Page 12 of 21

An example of the interpretation of the word guarantee in the context of the contract

as a whole is found in Hutchinson v. Hylton Holdings and Another [supra.]. The

defendant had signed a document in which he guaranteed specific performance of the

contract for the sale of land in his personal capacity. The purchaser of the land was non-

existent so there was no principal obligation and no suretyship. The Court held that the

clause resulted in an independent undertaking. The defendant had contracted as a co-

principal debtor and not surety. His undertaking was held not to be dependent upon the

non-performance of the purchaser but was in the form of an indemnity. Here the use of

the word guarantee was construed to create an independent obligation and hence the

undertaking was not a suretyship. Such result is not possible if one were to assume that

suretyship and guarantee are interchangeable.

Similarly, in List v. Jungers [1979(3) SA 106 (A) at 117-119] the use of the word guarantee

was held by Court to mean an original undertaking whereby the promissor bound himself

as principal debtor and not as surety.

These authorities support the statement in Caneys The Law of Suretyship [Forsyth &

Pretorius (eds.), 5th edition (Juta & Co. Ltd., 2002), page 27], that guarantee is a distinct

although difficult concept and seeks to provide a precise definition and explore its

relationship with suretyship. Caney [supra. page 31] goes on to state that with a contract

of guarantee, the guarantor undertakes a principal obligation to indemnify the promisee

on the happening of certain events.

According to Caney [supra., page 32]:

What then is the difference between a guarantee that a debtor will perform and

suretyship? Lubbe makes one point of distinction clear : the guarantors obligation,

as an obligation independent of that of the debtor, is to indemnify the creditor in

respect of losses suffered through the debtors non-performance, whereas the

Page 13 of 21

surety, as we have seen, is only liable for losses resulting from the debtors breach

of contract [...] suretyship is an undertaking, in the first instance, that the debtor

himself will perform, and only secondarily that if he fails to perform that the

surety will do so. With guarantee, on the other hand, the guarantor undertakes

to pay on the happening of a certain event but does not promise that that event

will not happen. (emphasis added)

Thus, it appears that in Roman-Dutch law, a guarantee given by a guarantor to a

promisee in relation to a promise by a third party to the promisee, does create an

independent obligation to that of the debtor. It is at this point that one sees a difference

in the approach between Roman-Dutch law and English law since in English law, a true

guarantee created an accessory obligation to that of the debtor whilst in specific cases

such as on-demand guarantees and performance guarantees, the obligation undertaken

is an independent obligation [See Peoples Bank (supra., pages 10-12)].

Finally, in the context of English law, the distinctions sought to be drawn between a

guarantee and indemnity has been criticised for raising a barren controversy and raising

many hair-splitting distinctions of exactly that kind which bring the law into hatred,

ridicule and contempt of the public [Yeoman Credit Ltd. v. Latter [(1961) 1 W.L.R. 828,

835].

Caney [supra. page 34] states that there is no difference between a contract of guarantee

and a contract of indemnity. The differences, if any, are only of nuance and degree.

I have sought to expound a few general principles governing contracts of suretyship,

contracts of guarantee and indemnities in Roman-Dutch law. Nevertheless, freedom of

contract generally permits parties to determine their respective rights and obligations.

Hence the rights of the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and Appellant must be determined based

on the language of the Guarantee. Where the language establishes that the parties

Page 14 of 21

intended to create specific rights and duties which may be at variance with the meaning

assigned to specific terms in the governing law, the intention of the parties must prevail.

Let me now examine the Guarantee upon which the Plaintiff sued the Appellant in order

to determine the rights and obligations of the parties.

Interpretation of the Guarantee

The Plaintiff sued the Appellant on document titled Guarantee and Indemnity (P6). This

by itself is confusing given the differences between a guarantee and indemnity identified

above. Nevertheless, one cannot interpret a contract based purely on internal linguistic

considerations. As I pointed out in Peoples Bank [supra.], the mere use of a descriptive

term cannot affect the reality of the transaction. The agreement must be objectively

construed as a whole to determine the intention of the parties.

Clause 1 of the Guarantee reads as follows:

[] (hereinafter called "the Lessee" which expression shall include its successors-in-title and permitted assigns) and Guarantors and each of them do hereby jointly and severally guarantee the punctual payment by the Lessee to the Lessor of all rent interest and all other sums whatsoever due under the Lease Agreement including the payment of any award taken by the Lessor in any arbitration commenced under article 25 of the Lease Agreement and the due performance of all the Lessee's obligations thereunder and the Guarantors further jointly and severally undertake to indemnify the Lessor on demand against all losses, expenses (including Legal costs on a full indemnity basis) charges and damages incurred or suffered by the Lessor in consequence of any failure by the Lessee to perform any of the Lessee's obligations under the Lease Agreement. (emphasis added)

In terms of this clause, the Appellant and the 1st Defendant have jointly and severally

guaranteed the punctual payment by the Lessee to the Plaintiff of all rent interest and all

other sums whatsoever due under the Lease Agreement including the payment of any

award taken by the Lessor in any arbitration commenced under Article 25 of the Lease

Agreement and the due performance of all the Lessees obligations thereunder.

Page 15 of 21

This part of Clause 1 of the Guarantee brings it within the first part of the definition of a

contract of suretyship as expounded above, namely an undertaking that the Lessee will

perform his obligations in terms of the lease Agreement.

Clause 1 of the Guarantee goes on to show that the Appellant and the 1st Defendant

further jointly and severally undertook to indemnify the Plaintiff on demand against all

losses, expenses (including Legal costs on a full indemnity basis) charges and damages

incurred or suffered by the Lessor in consequence of any failure by the Lessee to perform

any of the Lessees obligations under the Lease Agreement. This obligation to indemnify

against all losses suffered consequent to the failure to perform is more akin to the

impugned Guarantee being an indemnity rather than a contract of suretyship.

Clause 2 of the Guarantee reads as follows:

The guarantor further declare and specifically agree that the liability of the guarantors under this guarantee and Indemnity shall be as principal debtors and not merely as sureties and that this Guarantee and Indemnity shall be a continuing security and shall be irrevocable and the liability of the Guarantors shall not be in any way discharged, diminished or affected by the granting of time or indulgence to the Lessee by the Lessor or by the Lessor effecting any compromise with the Lessee-or entering into any agreement not to sue the Lessee or effecting any variations of the Lease Agreement or any change in the constitution of the Lessee and liability hereunder shall subsist whether or not the Lessor has a legal right and whether or not the Lessor has availed itself of its legal remedies against the Lessee and the liability of the Guarantors shall also extend to cover any renewal or renewals of the Lease Agreement and that this Guarantee and the Indemnity shall not be affected or prejudiced by any other guarantees and/or indemnities and any other forms of security now or hereafter held by the Lessor. (emphasis added)

This clause provides an important insight into the intention of the parties. The Appellant

and the 1st Defendant have declared and specifically agreed that their liability under the

Guarantee shall be as principal debtors and not merely as sureties. This is a categorical

dissecting of the Guarantee from the principal of co-extensiveness which is an important

Page 16 of 21

element of any contract of suretyship. Both the Appellant and the 1st Defendant have

undertaken an independent and primary obligation rather than an ancillary or secondary

obligation.

Moreover, The Appellant and the 1st Defendant goes on to agree in Clause 2 that the

Guarantee shall be a continuing security and shall be irrevocable and their liability shall

not be in anyway discharged, diminished or affected by the granting of time or indulgence

to the Lessee by the Plaintiff or by the Plaintiff effecting any compromise with the Lessee

or entering into any agreement not to sue the Lessee or effecting any variations of the

Lease Agreement or any change in the constitution of the Lessee.

These reflect the intention of the parties to maintain the validity of the Guarantee

irrespective of certain incidents relating to the debtor which fortify the conclusion that it

is akin to a guarantee rather than suretyship. This is fortified by the obligation that the

liability of the Appellant and 1st Defendant shall also extend to cover any renewal or

renewals of the Lease Agreement and that the Guarantee shall not be affected or

prejudiced by any other guarantees and/or indemnities and any other forms of security

held by the Lessor.

Clause 4 of the Guarantee reads as follows:

The Guarantors specifically agree that the Lessor shall be at liberty either in one action to sue the Lessee and the Guarantors (or some or any of them) and also any other person or persons all jointly or severally or to proceed in the right to claim that the Lessee should be excused or proceeded against by action in the first instance and the right to claim that the Lessor should divide its claim and bring actions against the Guarantors or any other person or persons whomsoever each for his portion pro rata and the right to claim in any action brought against the Guarantors (with or without all or any other person) that the Lessor should only recover from the Guarantors a pro rata share of the amount claimed and all other rights and benefits to which sureties are or may be by law entitled IT BEING AGREED that the Guarantors are liable in all respects hereunder as principal

Page 17 of 21

debtors to the extent aforementioned including the liability to be sued before recourse is had against the Lessee. (emphasis added)

Clause 4 of the Guarantee provides the answer to some of the issues raised by the

Appellant in this appeal. It provides that the Appellant and the 1st Defendant have

specifically agreed that the Plaintiff shall be at liberty either in one action to sue the

Lessee and Appellant and the 1st Defendant or some of them and also any other person

or persons all jointly or severally. They have also agreed that the Appellant and the 1st

Defendant are liable in all respects as principal debtors to the extent aforementioned

including the liability to be sued before recourse is had against the Lessee.

The Appellant contends that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that

despite a decree been entered by the High Court in favour of the Plaintiff against the

Lessee allowing the Plaintiff to recover the amount due under the Lease Agreement, the

Plaintiff has instituted this action against the Guarantors without pursuing the said

decree.

However, as expounded above, One of the defences available to a surety is the benefit of

excussion (beneficium ordinis seu excussionis). It means that the creditor must exhaust

his legal remedies against the principal debtor for payment right up to the execution

against his property [See Grotious 3.3.27; Voet 46.1.14; Van Leeuwen CF 1.4.17.18; Hurley

v. Marais (1883) 2 SC 155; Wolfson v. Crowe 1904 TS 682; Worthington v. Wilson 1918

TPD 104].

However, this benefit can be renounced by the surety expressly [Grotious 3.3.29; Voet

46.1.16; Neon and Cold Cathode Illuminations (Pty) Ltd v. Ephron 1978 (1) SA 463(A)] or

impliedly.

Page 18 of 21

In the present case, the Appellant and the 1st Defendant have expressly waived off this

benefit. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff in fact instituted action initially against the Lessee and

sought to execute the writ it obtained against the Lessee. According to the evidence of

Anil Krishantha Salgadu, Assistant Manager of the Plaintiff, the writ could not be executed

since the Lessee was dead by then. Therefore, the contention of the Appellant that the

Plaintiff cannot maintain this action without pursuing the decree against the lessee is

devoid of any merit.

The Guarantee is an on-demand guarantee. The obligation on the part of the Appellant

and 1st Defendant arises only upon a demand made by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff made a

demand after failing to recover the amount due from the Lessee. Therefore, the

contention of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the

obligation of the Appellant and 1st Defendant is to indemnify the losses of the Plaintiff

and the failure on the part of the Plaintiff to recover the amount due under the said

decree has resulted in the liability of the Guarantors being unjustly increased is devoid of

any merit as well.

The Appellant contends that the learned High Court Judge has failed to address the issue

regarding prescription from a correct perspective. The general principle is that where the

debt of the principal debtor is barred by prescription, the remedy against the surety is

also barred. Nevertheless, as adumbrated above, the Guarantee is not a contract of

suretyship and the obligation undertaken by the Appellant and the 1st Defendant is an

independent and primary obligation rather than an ancillary or secondary obligation to

that of the Lessee. Moreover, the Plaintiff instituted action against the Lessee prior to

that claim being prescribed. Therefore, this contention must also necessarily fail.

In any event, the Guarantee is payable on-demand. The obligation on the part of the 1st

Defendant and Appellant arises upon a demand being made [See L.B. Finance Ltd. v.

Manchanayake [(2000) 2 Sri.L.R. 142 (CA); Hatton National Bank Ltd. v. Sellers Sports

(Pvt) Ltd. and Others [(2000) 3 Sri.L.R. 326 (SC)]. The Plaintiff made the demand on

13.03.2008 by letters of demand marked P22(a) and P22(b). This action was instituted

on or about May/June, 2008 [29/02/05/06/2008]. Accordingly, this action is not

prescribed.

Interest above Principal

The only remaining point to be determined is whether the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider that the unexplained delay on the part of the Plaintiff to take steps

against the Guarantors has been for the benefit of the Plaintiff especially in view of the

fact that at the termination of the Lease Agreement, the amount due was only Rs.

2,236,728.39 whereas by the alleged demand, the Plaintiff has added further interest and

demanded Rs. 9,450,732/- from the 1st Defendant and Appellant.

The arbitration award against the Lessee awarded the Plaintiff a sum of Rs. 148,000/=,

being arrears of lease rentals as at the date of the termination of the lease, namely 21st

July 1999, payable with interest at the rate of 4% per mensem from 22.07.2001 till

payment in full and a further sum of Rs. 2,236,728/39, being the amount due as at

13.06.2001, being the balance of the total lease rentals payable together with interest

thereon at the rate of 4% per mensem from 14.06.2001 till payment in full.

According to the statement of accounts relating to the Lessee, G. K. B. Amarajeewa,

marked P8, the total commitment was Rs. 2,458,110/=. The total claimed from the 1st

Defendant and Appellant is Rs. 9,450,732/=. The learned High Court Judge entered

judgment as prayed for in the plaint.

In Harankaha Arachchige Menaka Jayasankha and Another v. Standard Credit Lanka

Limited [S.C. (CHC) Appeal No. 72/2013, S.C.M. 23.11.2023], I had the occasion to

examine the relevant principles in Roman-Dutch law governing the amount recoverable

as interest, in the context of Section 5 of Civil Law Ordinance, which states that the

amount recoverable on account of interest shall in no case exceed the principal amount,

and Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code. I held that:

1. Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance applies only to the amount of interest due on

the principal sum as at the date of the institution of the action.

2. This prohibition does not apply to the power vested in Court in terms of Section

192 of the Civil Procedure Code to award interest on the principal sum according

to the rate agreed between parties from the date of action to the date of decree

and on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of

payment or such earlier date determined by Court.

Accordingly, I hold that the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim as interest, any sum more than

Rs. 2,458,110/= for the period up to the date of the institution of this action. In other

words, the total sum (principal plus interest) that the Plaintiff is entitled to up to the date

of the institution of this action is Rs. 4,916,220/= (Rs. 2,458,110/= x 2).

In terms of Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code, the Plaintiff is entitled to interest on

the principal sum according to the rate agreed between parties (48% per annum) from

the date of action to the date of decree and on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the

date of the decree to the date of payment.

The judgment of the High Court dated 18.062013 is varied to that extent. The learned

High Court Judge is directed to enter decree accordingly.
