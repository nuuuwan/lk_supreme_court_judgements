"In view of the existence of diverse definitions, it is not possible to provide a universally"
"accepted general definition of what is meant by a contract of suretyship. Nevertheless,"
"the fundamental feature is that in a contract of suretyship, the obligation of the surety is"
"accessory to the principal obligation of the debtor and not an independent obligation."
"Difference between Contract of Suretyship and Contract of Guarantee"
"According  to  Weeramantry  [The  Law  of  Contracts,  Vol.  I,  page  190],  contracts  which"
"charge  a  person  with  the  debt,  default  or  miscarriage  of  another  are  contracts  of"
"suretyship  or  guarantee.  He  appears  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  “suretyship”  and"
"“guarantee” are interchangeable."
"Indeed, many writings and judicial decisions do reflect this understanding [See Caney’s"

"However,  Courts  have  also  held  that  the  word  “guarantee”  is  open  to  a  number  of"
"meanings and its meaning when used in a specific document depends on the context in"
"which it is used. In Walker’s Fruit Farms Ltd v. Sumner [1930 TPD 394 at 398], Greenberg,"
"J. held that the ordinary meaning is to assure a person of the receipt or possession of"
"something. In Dempster v. Addington Football Club (Pty) Ltd. [1967(3) SA 262(D) at 267]"
"and Cazalet v. Johnson [1914 TPD 142 at 145] it was held to mean ‘pay’."
