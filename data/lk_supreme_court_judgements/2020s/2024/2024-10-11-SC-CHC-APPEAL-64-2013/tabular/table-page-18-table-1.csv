"In the present case, the Appellant and the 1st Defendant have expressly waived off this"
"benefit. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff in fact instituted action initially against the Lessee and"
"sought to execute the writ it obtained against the Lessee. According to the evidence of"
"Anil Krishantha Salgadu, Assistant Manager of the Plaintiff, the writ could not be executed"
"since the Lessee was dead by then. Therefore, the contention of the Appellant that the"
"Plaintiff  cannot  maintain  this  action  without  pursuing  the  decree  against  the  lessee  is"
"devoid of any merit."
"The Guarantee is an on-demand guarantee. The obligation on the part of the Appellant"
"and 1st Defendant arises only upon a demand made by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff made a"
"demand  after  failing  to  recover  the  amount  due  from  the  Lessee.  Therefore,  the"
"contention of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the"
"obligation of the Appellant and 1st Defendant is to indemnify the losses of the Plaintiff"
"and  the  failure  on  the  part  of  the  Plaintiff  to  recover  the  amount  due  under  the  said"
"decree has resulted in the liability of the Guarantors being unjustly increased is devoid of"
"any merit as well."
"The Appellant contends that the learned High Court Judge has failed to address the issue"
"regarding prescription from a correct perspective. The general principle is that where the"
"debt of the principal debtor is barred by prescription, the remedy against the surety is"
"also  barred.  Nevertheless,  as  adumbrated  above,  the  Guarantee  is  not  a  contract  of"
"suretyship and the obligation undertaken by the Appellant and the 1st Defendant is an"
"independent and primary obligation rather than an ancillary or secondary obligation to"
"that of the Lessee.  Moreover, the Plaintiff instituted action against the Lessee prior to"
"that claim being prescribed. Therefore, this contention must also necessarily fail."
