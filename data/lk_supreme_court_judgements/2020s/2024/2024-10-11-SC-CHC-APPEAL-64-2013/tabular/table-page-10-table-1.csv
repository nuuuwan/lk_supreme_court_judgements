"Caney’s  The  Law  of  Suretyship  [Forsyth  &  Pretorius  (eds.),  5th  edition  (Juta  &  Co.  Ltd.,"
"2002), page 27] sought to provide a definition of suretyship as:"
"“[…] an accessory contract by which a person (the surety) undertakes to the creditor"
"of another (the principal debtor), primarily that the principal debtor, who remains"
"bound, will perform his obligation to the creditor and, secondarily, that if and so"
"far as the principal debtor fails to do so, he, the surety will perform it, or failing"
"that, indemnify the creditor.”"
