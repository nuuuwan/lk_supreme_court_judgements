"concluded the contract and gave rise to a legal obligation on the part of the promissor to"
"do what he had promised."
"The  verbal  contract  (stipulatio)  took  three  different  forms  depending  on  the  form  of"
"words used by the stipulator (creditor) to the intended surety.  The words  were either"
"idem dari spondes, idem fidepromittis or idem fide tua esse jubes?  The ensuing contracts"
"were referred to as sponsio, fide-promissio and fidejussor and the surety referred to as"

"the rights of action to the surety which the creditor had against the debtor. It appears"
