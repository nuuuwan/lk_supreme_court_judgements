"to pay on the happening of a certain event but does not promise that that event"
"will not happen.” (emphasis added)"
"Thus,  it  appears  that  in  Roman-Dutch  law,  a  “guarantee”  given  by  a  guarantor  to  a"
"promisee  in  relation  to  a  promise  by  a  third  party  to  the  promisee,  does  create  an"
"independent obligation to that of the debtor. It is at this point that one sees a difference"
"in the approach between Roman-Dutch law and English law since in English law, a “true"
"guarantee” created an accessory obligation to that of the debtor whilst in specific cases"
"such as on-demand guarantees and performance guarantees, the obligation undertaken"
"is an independent obligation [See Peoples Bank (supra., pages 10-12)]."
"Finally,  in  the  context  of  English  law,  the  distinctions  sought  to  be  drawn  between  a"
"guarantee and indemnity has been criticised for raising a barren controversy and raising"
"many  hair-splitting  distinctions  of  exactly  that  kind  which  bring  the  law  into  hatred,"
"ridicule and contempt of the public [Yeoman Credit Ltd. v. Latter [(1961) 1 W.L.R. 828,"
"835]."
"Caney [supra. page 34] states that there is no difference between a contract of guarantee"
"and a contract of indemnity. The differences, if any, are only of nuance and degree."
"I  have  sought  to  expound  a  few  general  principles  governing  contracts  of  suretyship,"
"contracts of guarantee and indemnities in Roman-Dutch law. Nevertheless, freedom of"
"contract generally permits parties to determine their respective rights and obligations."
"Hence the rights of the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and Appellant must be determined based"
"on  the  language  of  the  Guarantee.  Where  the  language  establishes  that  the  parties"
