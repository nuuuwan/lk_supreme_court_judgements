"the institute of suretyship and its incidents as follows:","",""
"","“The contract of suretyship presupposes a principal obligation which has the same",""
"","object, in the sense used by Continental jurists, as the contract of the surety. This is",""
"expressed  by 
the  maxim  una  eadem","res  vertitur","in  obligatione.  Troplong,"
"","Cautionnement, sec.22. The legal scope of the surety’s contract is identical with",""
"","that of the principal debtor  --- accessorium sui principalis naturam sequitur. The",""
"","surety undertakes the same obligation as the debtor, and undertakes to perform",""
"","this same obligation so soon as the debtor, when called upon, fails to perform it.",""
"","Troplong, caut:46. It is true there are two contracts, the one between the creditor",""
"","and the debtor and the other between the creditor and the surety. But the contract",""
"between  the  creditor  and  the  surety","is  not  an","independent  contract  with  an"
"","obligation of its own but an accessory contract with the very same obligation that",""
"","exists between the principal debtor and the creditor. Although it is true that the",""
"","suretyship contract may be entered into by an agreement different to that of the",""
"","principal contract, yet immediately the surety agrees to become such, whether by",""
"","a written or a verbal agreement, then his contract with the creditor is of the same",""
"","nature as that of the principal debtor, because it becomes accessory to it, or is, as",""
"it were, absorbed by it.” (emphasis added)","",""
