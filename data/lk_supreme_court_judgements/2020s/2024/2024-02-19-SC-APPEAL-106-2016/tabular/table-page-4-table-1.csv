"deaf  and  dumb  by  birth.  Plaintiffs  invoked  the  jurisdiction  of  the  District  Court  naming  four"
"defendants.  The  first  defendant  is  the  elder  brother  of  the  two  plaintiffs.  Second  and  the  third"
"defendants  are  children  of the first  defendant.  The fourth  defendant’s father is  a brother of the"
"two plaintiffs and the first defendant. The two plaintiffs inter alia whilst invoking jurisdiction of"
"the District Court sought a declaration that four deeds of gift that are described in the plaint are"
"null  and  void.  Plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  said  deeds  were  fraudulently  executed.  Plaintiffs"
"pleaded  that  all  four  properties  described  in  the  four  schedules  belonged  to  them.  The  first"
"defendant  and  his  children  –  the  second  and  third  defendants  contested  the  claim  of  the  two"
"plaintiffs. However, the fourth defendant did not contest the claim of the plaintiffs. Furthermore,"
"he  contended  that  he  came  to  know  about  the  existence  of  a  deed  of  gift  by  which  the  first"
"plaintiff had donated the property described therein to him (subject to the life interest of the said"
"plaintiff)  only  after  the  proceedings  were  initiated  by  the  two  plaintiffs  in  the  District  Court."
"According to this impugned deed, the first defendant had accepted the said gift on behalf of the"
"fourth defendant. The fourth defendant pleaded that he does not expect such a gift from the two"
"plaintiffs and therefore has no objection for the court granting relief to the plaintiffs."
