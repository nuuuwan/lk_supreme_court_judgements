"T
he  contention  of  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  for  the  second  defendant-appellant  is  that  a"
"court could grant relief only when it is prayed for. He submitted, that the claim in the plaint and"
"relief prayed for is setting aside the deeds, and the absence of any prayer for declaration of title"
"and  eviction  of  the  defendants  precludes  the  plaintiffs  obtaining  a  writ  of  possession  for  the"
"execution of the decree based on the judgment by which the four impugned deeds were declared"
"null and void."
