"material filed in the District Court shows that the plaintiffs – respondent invoked section 777 of"
"the Civil Procedure Code when seeking the writ of possession."
"W
hen this Court granted Special Leave to Appeal the following two questions of law had been"
"identified."
"1
.  Could a court grant relief not prayed for, either by the plaintiff or the defendant?"
"2
.  Even if the question No.01 above is answered in the affirmative, taking into account the facts"
"and circumstances of the instant case, would Section 777 of the Civil Procedure Code apply"
"to the execution proceedings of this case?"
"The learned President’s Counsel for the respondent submitted that the unique facts in the instant"
"case justifies the course of action adopted by the District Court even though, there was no prayer"
"to  restore  possession  in  the  plaint.  It  is  his  contention  that  the  two  plaintiffs  were  in  the"
"possession of the property described in the fourth schedule of the plaint, which was the subject"
"matter  in  the  impugned  deed  of  gift  No  338.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  contest  that  the  two"
"plaintiffs  became  the  owners  of  the  corpus  described  in  the  fourth  schedule  of  the  plaint  from"
"11th May 1963, by the deed no. 3361. Therefore, he contended that there was no necessity for the"
"plaintiffs to have sought specific reliefs of declaration of title or ejectment as they were already"
"in the possession of the corpus as rightful owners when the jurisdiction of the District Court was"
"invoked  in  1982.  The  only  basis  on  which  the  first  to  the  third  defendants  claimed  title  to  the"
"lands and buildings described in the plaint was that the two plaintiffs transferred the title and all"
"other  interests  by  the  impugned  four  deeds  of  gift.  Whereas,  the  plaintiffs  sought  that  the  said"
"four  deeds  be  declared  null  and  void.  In  these  circumstances  there  was  no  necessity  to  have"
"sought an additional relief of declaration of title as they were continuing in the possession of the"
"relevant properties as lawful owners. The learned President’s Counsel for the respondents further"
"submitted  that  the  conduct  of  the  second  defendant  while  the  appellate  proceedings  were  in"
"progress  warranted  the  District  Court  to  issue  the  writ  of  possession  to  enabling  the  plaintiffs"
"enjoying the benefit of the judgment and the decree entered in the case."
