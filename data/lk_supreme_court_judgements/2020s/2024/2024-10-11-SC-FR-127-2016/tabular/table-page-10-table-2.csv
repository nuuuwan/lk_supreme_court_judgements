"rights of property, so they will also intervene to protect his"
"right to work."

It is therefore the paramount duty of Courts to ensure that"
"a citizen’s right to work is protected. The right to employment"
"being a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution, it"
"would be the duty of the Court to exercise their authority in"
"the interest of the individual citizen and of the general public"
"to safeguard that right.”"
