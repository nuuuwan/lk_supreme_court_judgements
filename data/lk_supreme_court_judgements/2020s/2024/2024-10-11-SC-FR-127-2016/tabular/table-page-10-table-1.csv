"Bandaranayake J. (as she was then), quoting the pronouncement"
"of  Lord  Denning  in  Nagle  v.  Feilden  and  others  ([1966]  1  All"
"E.R. 689 at page 694) stated that,"
"“...a man’s right to work at his trade or profession is just as"
"important to him as, perhaps more important than, his rights"
"of property. Just as the courts will intervene to protect his"
"rights of property, so they will also intervene to protect his"
"right to work."
