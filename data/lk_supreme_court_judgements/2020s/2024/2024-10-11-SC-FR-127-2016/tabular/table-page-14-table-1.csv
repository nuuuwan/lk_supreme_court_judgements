"41.","In  case  of  Sasanasiritissa  Thero  v  P.A.  de  Silva  [1989]  2"
"","SLR,356, Kulatunga, J explained that,"
"","“in  its  narrow  sense,  mala  fide  means  personal  animosity,"
"","spite, vengeance, personal benefit to the authority itself or its"
"","relations or friends, the phrase is used by Courts in the broad"
"","sense of any improper exercise or abuse of power.”"
"42.","In light of that, one of the most critical aspects to address is with"
"","regard  to  the  dates  associated  with  the  B-Report  440/16  [P15]"
"","and B Report 441/16 [P16]. Both reports are dated 21.03.2016."
"","However,  the  raid  and  the  subsequent  arrest  of  the  petitioners"
"","occurred on 23.03.2016. This discrepancy in the dates suggests"
"","that  the  reports  were  prepared  in  advance  by  the  respondents,"
"","indicating  maliciousness 
of 
the 
respondents 
to  arrest 
the"
"","petitioners  through  the  raid.  Although  this  issue  came  to  light"
"","during the hearing of this case on 09.07.2024, the learned State"
"","Counsel for the respondents was not in a position to clarify as to"
"","how the date of the B reports were shown as 21.03.2016 when in"
"","fact the raid was conducted on the 23.03.2016."
"43.","It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  The  Hon.  Attorney  General,  upon"
"","completing the relevant investigations, has decided not to proceed"
"","on 
all 
charges 
levelled 
against 
the 
petitioners 
for 
the"
"","aforementioned  allegations.  This  decision  clearly  demonstrates"
"","the innocence of the petitioners and highlights that they endured"
"","this unjust treatment as a result of the malicious conduct of the"
"","respondents."
"44.  Furthermore, it has been submitted that a team of officers led by",""
"","the  3rd  and  4th  respondents  have  removed  the  CCTV  equipment"
"","from 
the  pharmacy  premises  without 
any 
justification 
or"
"","explanation  seemingly  to  torment  the  petitioners.  These  actions"
"","further  show  malice  on  the  part  of  the  3rd  and  4th  respondents."
"","The 3rd respondent in his affidavit has failed to explain as to why"
"","the DVR of the CCTV camera system was removed. However, in"
"","his  affidavit  dated  22.04.2016  [P-12],  employee  Viraj  Sanjeewa"
"","has deposed as to how and why the cameras were removed."
