When this matter was taken up for argument on 13.06.2023, both parties informed this Court that they will restrict their appeals only to the two questions of law on which the leave had been granted. Thus, this Court need not go into the question whether Baby Nona could have cancelled the aforesaid deeds of gift without resorting actions filed in the relevant Courts. As per the above quoted paragraphs of the High Court Judgment, the learned High Court Judges have expressed its observation as follows; \u201cIn the circumstances, the question arises that as to whether the impugned deeds were executed during the lucid interval that any mental patient becomes normal. But, unfortunately this issue has never been raised at the trial\u201d. It is clear that learned High Court Judges erred in the said observation. As mentioned before issue No. 23 which was raised by the Defendant specifically focused on the fact whether Baby Nona had the mental capacity at the time of executing deed No.13878. Even issue No.22 focused on her ability to revoke- vide page 6 of the High Court Judgment and page 84 of the proceedings. If it was done during a lucid interval during a mental illness in which she could understand the gravity of her actions as explained below, she has the capacity. Learned Counsel for the Defendant has referred to Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 4th Edition Vol.30 page 580 which speaks of the presumption of Continuance of Mental Disorder as follows; \u201cWhere a person has been proved or is admitted to have so mentally disordered as to be incapable for purpose of contract or disposition, the law presumes such a condition to continue until it is proved to have ceased; and the burden of proving recovery or a lucid interval, as the case may be, lies on the person alleging it. The evidence to prove a recovery or a lucid interval must be as strong and demonstrative of the fact as when the object is to prove mental disorder\" The above speaks of English law and this appears to be the position in Indian law too. As per above quoted part, it appears that as there is a presumption of continuance the party who assert or rely on the validity of the contract has to prove that it was made during a period when the mental disorder has ceased or the relevant person was recovered from such disorder or during a lucid interval. However, our common law is Roman Dutch Law (RDL) and the RDL principles in this regard is found in the Wille\u2019s Principles of South African law in page 232 which have also been referred to in the written submissions of the Defendant.

There is no evidence that she was treated for mental illness after coming back from the mental hospital.

In her evidence, she has said that impugned deeds were her voluntary acts.

On the other hand, as indicated above, other than she was suffering from some mental illness, there was no acceptable evidence to say that she was not in a position to understand the gravity of her action. She has been discharged from the mental hospital in May 1980, most probably after the recovery. There is no evidence that she suffered from a serious illness after that. The Deed No.165 which was the gift given to the Defendant was revoked only in 1984 by Deed No.13876. The deed which transferred the subject matter to the Plaintiff took place in 1987.When Baby Nona gave evidence in 2000, the learned District Judge, as the judge who observed her while giving evidence, has not recorded any observation as to her incapacity. As there was no adjudication or declaration as to her mental incapacity, there was no presumption that the mental disorder of Baby Nona continued from 1980 even after her release from the mental hospital. As such, the learned High Court Judges erred in their findings. Hence, for the reasons discussed above, the two questions of law mentioned above has to be answered in the affirmative.",
