Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the Commercial High Court against the

1st defendant bank and the 2nd defendant auctioneer seeking a

declaration that the resolution passed by the board of directors of the

bank on 27.03.2018 in terms of section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by

Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, as amended, is a nullity.

By this resolution the board of directors of the bank resolved that the

mortgaged property of the plaintiff be sold by public auction to recover

the dues to the bank.

The Commercial High Court by order dated 23.06.2020 issued an

enjoining order followed by an interim injunction preventing the bank

from auctioning the property on 07.08.2018 or on any subsequent date

without following the proper procedure stipulated in the Act.

The Court took the view that the bank failed to give proper notice of sale

in terms of section 9 of the Act, since notice of sale had been given by the

auctioneer, not by the bank.

3

SC/APPEAL/144/2022

The short question to be decided by this Court is whether the notice of

sale as mandated by section 9 must be given by the bank or if it can

alternatively be given by the auctioneer.

In terms of section 4, the board of directors of the bank may by resolution

to be recorded in writing authorize any person specified in the resolution

to conduct the auction.

4. Subject to the provisions of section 7 the Board may by resolution

to be recorded in writing authorize any person specified in the

resolution to sell by public auction any property mortgaged to the

bank as security for any loan in respect of which default has been

made in order to recover the whole of the unpaid portion of such loan,

and the interest due thereon up to the date of the sale, together with

the money and costs recoverable under section 13.

In the resolution relevant to this case, it is expressly stated that the board

resolved to authorize the 2nd defendant auctioneer to conduct the public

auction.

Section 8 requires the notice of resolution to be published in the gazette

and newspapers, and copies of the same to be sent to the borrower.

8. Notice of every resolution under section 4 authorizing the sale of

any property shall be published in the Gazette and in at least three

daily newspapers, in the Sinhala, Tamil and English languages and

copies of such notice shall be dispatched to the borrower, if he is

alive, and to every person who has, in respect of that property,

registered his address as required by section 2 and if that property

consists of the interest of a lessee under a lease from the State, to

the Land Commissioner.

4

SC/APPEAL/144/2022

The requirements of section 8 have been complied with by the bank. In

other words, the bank informed the plaintiff in writing that the board of

directors of the bank passed a resolution authorizing the 2nd defendant

to sell the mortgaged property by public auction to recover the dues to

the bank.

Section 9 of the Act reads as follows:

9. Notice of the date, time and place of every sale authorized by a

resolution under section 4 shall, not less than fourteen days before

the date fixed for the sale be published in the Gazette and copies of

such notice shall be

(a) dispatched to the borrower, if he is alive, and to every person to

whom notice of any resolution is required to be dispatched under

section 2,

(b) pasted on or near the property which is to be sold.

The requirements of section 9 have been complied with by the auctioneer,

not by the bank. The crux of the matter is whether the auctioneers

compliance with the requirements of section 9 is sufficient, or if these

requirements must specifically be fulfilled by the bank.

Section 9 requires the publication of a notice in the gazette 14 days before

the date of the auction, specifying the date, time and place of the auction.

The section further requires that a copy of the notice to be dispatched to

the borrower and pasted on or near the property to be auctioned.

Section 9 does not state who should take these steps. The requirements

under section 9 pertain to the actual conduct of the auction. As stated

previously, section 4 empowers the board of directors of the bank to

authorize any person specified in the resolution to conduct the public

auction, as the board of directors cannot practically conduct the auction.

5

SC/APPEAL/144/2022

Accordingly, the person who was authorized by the board to conduct the

auction can take required steps under section 9. When section 9 notice

is given by the auctioneer specifying the date, time and place of the

auction, the bank had already informed the borrower the name of the

auctioneer in compliance with section 8 of the Act.

So long as the requirements of section 9 have been complied with by the

person who was authorized by the board of directors to conduct the

auction, the borrower cannot challenge the auction on the basis that the

notice of sale as required by section 9 was given by such person, not by

the bank.

No prejudice has been caused to the plaintiff by the fact that notice of

sale was given by the auctioneer, not by the bank.

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted are as

follows:

(a) When the bank by resolution under section 4 of the Act authorizes

any person to sell the property by public auction, whether that

person could take steps to notify the date of sale under section 9

of the Act?

(b) Did the learned High Court Judge err in law by misinterpreting

sections 4 and 9 of the Act?

I answer the questions of law in the affirmative.

The order of the Commercial High Court dated 23.06.2023 is set aside

and the appeal is allowed with costs.
