"The preliminary plan No. 1277 and its report, P4(a) and P4(b), indicate"
"that the land that lies to the east of the corpus belongs to the 2nd Defendant."
"On the corpus there were 40 old coconut trees, as observed by the surveyor,"
"who also observed 3 old jack trees. Both the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant"
"claimed them. The surveyor also observed a pepper planation of about 2- 3"
"years  old  and  10  banana  clusters,  all  of  which  were  claimed  by  the  2nd"
"Defendant, along with a hut standing on that land. The portion of the land"
"covered by pepper plantation was depicted as Lot No. 2 of the plan, whereas"

"her rights to the plantation as well as to the old trees and to the entirety of"
"the  corpus.  The  surveyor  conceded  that  no  physical  boundaries  were  in"
"existence separating the two lots, as shown in the preliminary plan."
