"S.C. Appeal No. 126/2011"
"trial Court in that regard. He conceded during cross examination by the 2nd"
"Defendant 
  that  no  copy  of  the  Gazette  notification  of  the  Grant  was"
"tendered to Court or at least he requested one from his predecessor in title,"
"Sidurupitiye Kapurallage Sumanawathie Gunaratne."
"Compounding  the  multitude  of  serious  discrepancies  that  already"
"exists in the Plaintiff’s case, he used several names in reference to the land"
"to be partitioned without satisfying the Court that they all referred to one"
"and the same land. The name of the land stated in the preliminary plan is"
"different to the name of the land described in the title deed P3 relied upon"
"by the Plaintiff. The preliminary plan and the schedule to the Plaint referred"
"to a land called “Punchigoda Watta”. In the Deed No. 2389 (P3), the land was"
"referred  to  as  “Punchigoda”  whereas  Deed  No.  781  refers  to  a  land  called"
"“Punchigoda  Watta”.  The  copy  of  the  Land  Registry  Folio  (P5)  he  had"
"tendered to Court refers to a land called Meddakande Liyedde Pallekella."
"The boundaries to the land, described in P3, had a public road to its"
"north,  a  stream  called  Phimbiyagaha  Ara  to  its  east,  another  stream  called"
"Hulanda  Oya  to  the  south  and  the  Village  Council  Road  to  the  west."
"Importantly,  the  Deed  No.  781  (P4),  on  which  the  Plaintiff  claimed  he"
"acquired title to the corpus, depicts public roads to its northern and western"
"boundaries as in P3, but instead of the two streams that formed the eastern"
"and southern boundaries of the land described in P3, the description of P4"
"indicates that these two sides share common boundaries with State lands."
"These  boundaries  did  not  correspond  to  boundaries  as  shown 
in  the"
"Preliminary  Plan  either.  Furthermore,  the  land  described  in  Folio  (P5),"
"where the Plaintiff’s title  Deed, the 1st Defendant’s Deed and  Lis Pendense"
"were  registered,  does  not 
indicate 
it  had  Ara 
  and  Oya  to  any  of 
its"
