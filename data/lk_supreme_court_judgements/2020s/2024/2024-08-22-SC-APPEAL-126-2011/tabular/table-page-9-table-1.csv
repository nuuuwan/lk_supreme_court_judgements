"S.C. Appeal No. 126/2011"
"In  these  circumstances,  the  contention  of  the  Plaintiff  that  the  trial"
"Court  should  have  left  a  certain  portion  of  undivided  shares  unallotted"
"cannot succeed. This is because,  in the absence of any such evidence, the"
"trial Court is unable to decide the extent of the land she might have inherited"
"since her fatherâ€™s death or whether she is left with any residual entitlement"
"over the said land, after she conveyed her purported entitlement with the"
"execution of Deed of Transfer No. 781 (P4) to the Plaintiff."
