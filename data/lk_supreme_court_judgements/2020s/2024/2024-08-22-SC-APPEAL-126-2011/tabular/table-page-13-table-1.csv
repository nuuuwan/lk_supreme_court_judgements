"S.C. Appeal No. 126/2011"
"any  of  the  serious  discrepancies  that  had  the  potential  of  defeating  his"
"devolution of title presented before the District Court in the instant partition"
"action,  where  the  Court  is 
imposed  a  statutory  duty  to  undertake  an"
"investigation of title of each party, before arriving at a conclusion."
"In view of these glaring defects in the Plaintiff's case, the dismissal of"
"his  Plaint  by  the  District  Court  is  amply 
justified  and  accordingly  the"
"affirmation of that conclusion by the High Court of Civil Appeal could not"
"be 
faulted.  Thus, 
the  alternative  contention  advanced  by 
the 
learned"
"President’s Counsel, that the trial Court could have retained a portion of the"
"land unallotted if it found that certain parts of the devolution of title pleaded"
"by the Plaintiff is not proved, without dismissing the Plaint is also rejected."
"Turning 
to  consider  the  2nd  Defendant’s  claim  of  acquisition  of"
"prescriptive  title,  the  trial  Court,  answered  the  point  of  contest  No.  15,"
"suggested by her on acquisition of a prescriptive title, in the affirmative and"
"held  that  she  established  her  claim  to  the  corpus  in  its  entirety.  The  High"
"Court of Civil Appeal, having observed that neither the Plaintiff nor the 1st"
"Defendant ever possessed the corpus, and that the 2nd Defendant had been"
"in its possession for a long time adverse to the title of its owner, affirmed the"
"conclusion reached by the lower Court on point of contest No. 15."
"The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  Plaintiff, 
as 
another"
"alternative  to  his  contention  presented  on  the  dismissal  of  the  Plaint,"
"submitted  that  the  evidence  only  points  to  a  part  of  the  corpus  being"
"possessed by the 2nd Defendant and, both Courts erred in holding with her"
"that  she  had  established  her  adverse  possession  over  the  entirety  of  the"
"corpus."
