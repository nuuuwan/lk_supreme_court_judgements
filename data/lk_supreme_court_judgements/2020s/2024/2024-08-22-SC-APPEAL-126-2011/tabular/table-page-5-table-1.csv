"S.C. Appeal No. 126/2011"
"Civil Appeal that the Plaintiff “… did not want to produce certified copies of the"
"handful of deeds which he has referred to in the Plaint including the deed which he"
"alleges  to  transfer  ¼  shares  of  the  land  to  the  [1st]  defendant”  is  a  factually"
"erroneous one. This contention was advanced by the learned Counsel on the"
"premise that the Deed No. 66, on which the Plaintiff relied on to establish a"
"part of devolution of his title, was referred to in the recital of another Deed"
"No.  2389,  which  in  fact  was  tendered  as  P3.  Learned  President’s  Counsel"
"therefore submitted that the said reference in P3 should suffice to establish"
"that specific part of devolution of title of the Plaintiff, although Deed No. 66"
"was not produced at the trial. He also contended that similarly the extracts"
"from  the  Land  Registry  (P5)  which  contain  a  reference  to  Deed  No.  5527"
"should  suffice  in  establishing  his  devolution  of  title  as  pleaded,  although"
"that  conveyance  too  was  not  proceeded.  He  therefore  contended  that  the"
"Plaintiff has established the chain of his title to the corpus, which commenced"
"from  its  original  owner  S.K.  Appuhamy  Gunaratne  as  he  had  tendered  all"
"relevant deeds in order to establish that he is entitled to his share from the"
"corpus."
