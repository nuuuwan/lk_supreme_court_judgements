"S.C. Appeal No. 126/2011"
"said Deed 2V2, Sidurupitiye Kapurallage Appuhamy Gunaratne had gifted an"
"undivided ½ share of the land called Punchigoda to his daughter Sidurupitiye"
"Kapurallage Asilin Karunawathie a.k.a, Kamala Seneviratne."
"Thus, the Deed 2V2 indicated that the said original owner had another"
"daughter by the name of Sidurupitiye Kapurallage Asilin Karunawathie a.k.a,"
"Kamala Seneviratne and a ½ share of Punchigoda land had been gifted to her."
"Interestingly  in  this  Deed  of  Gift  2V2,  the  donor  Sidurupitiye  Kapurallage"
"Appuhamy Gunaratne imposed a condition that the said donee could transfer"
"title to the land gifted by him only among her brothers, namely, Sidurupitiye"
"Kapurallage  Charles  Gunaratne,  Sidurupitiye  Kapurallage  Midudasa  Gunaratne"
"and  Sidurupitiye  Kapurallage  Sumathipala  Gunaratne.  In  the  circumstances,"
"upon 
the  death  of  Sidurupitiye  Kapurallage  Appuhamy  Gunaratne, 
it 
is"
"apparent  that  not  only  Sumanawathie  Palihakkara  nee  Gunaratne  became"
"entitled  to  the  corpus  in  its  entirety,  but  she  may  have  had  to  share  her"
"entitlement 
to 
the  corpus  with  all  her  siblings, 
including  Sidurupitiye"
"Kapurallage Asilin Karunawathie a.k.a, Kamala Seneviratne,  who too may have"
"become co-owners to the same with her. The Plaintiff, in order to succeed in"
"his  devolution  of 
title 
to 
the 
corpus, 
should  have 
established 
that"
"Sumanawathie  Palihakkara  nee  Gunaratne 
is 
the  only 
legitimate  child  of"
"Sidurupitiye  Kapurallage  Appuhamy  Gunaratne,  enabling  the  trial  Court  to"
"hold that only she is entitled to paternal inheritance, which fact he did not"
"establish with positive evidence. In the absence of such evidence, the trial"
"Court is unable to determine that Sumanawathie Palihakkara nee Gunaratne is"
"the sole heir to Sidurupitiye Kapurallage Appuhamy Gunaratne  or there was"
"co-ownership after her father’s demise."
