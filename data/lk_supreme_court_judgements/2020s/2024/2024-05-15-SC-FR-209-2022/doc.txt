Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Petitioner to the instant application D. Pravesha Wickamasuriya had come before this Court

alleging the violation of her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution

by refusing the admission of her daughter Abeythunga Kankanam Gamachcige Sasadara to Grade -

1 of Southland College Galle for the Academic Year 2022.

It is admitted by both parties that the school admission to Grade-1 for the Academic Year 2022 is

governed by the Education Ministry Circular No 29/2019 read together with Circulars 16/2020,

13/2021 and the guidelines issued by the Ministry on 31.05.2021.

It is also not in dispute that the Petitioner and her husband who are residents at No.45,

Wickremapura, Kokwatta, Habaraduwa had applied admission for her daughter under the category

of Children of residents in close proximity to the school read with the provisions referred to in

Clause 3.2 of the guidelines issued on 31.05.2021.

As revealed before us, the Petitioner could obtain only 34.5 marks at the interview. Since there were

several schools with grade one classes between her residence and the school she applied for, she

could not obtain any marks under proximity to the school.

3 However, the petitioner had never challenged the marks allocated by the interview panel to her but

her grievance complaint before this Court was mainly based on the failure by the Respondents to

follow the provisions identified in Clause 3.2 of the guidelines which reads as follows;

3.2 In filling vacancies in schools vested to the government under Assisted Schools and

Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and Assisted Schools and Training

Schools (Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, the proportion of children belonging

to different religions at the time of vesting the school to the government will be taken into

consideration and the number of vacancies in the said school shall be accordingly divided

among different religions and categories. When the number of applications is less than the

number of vacancies set apart for a given category of a religion, remaining vacancies shall be

proportionately divided among other categories of the same religion. When there are no

applicants from a religion, or when the number of applications from a religion is less than

the number of vacancies set apart for that religion, such vacancies shall be proportionately

divided among other religions.

With regard to her religious belief, she had submitted in her petition filed before this Court that,

both herself and the minor child are worshippers of non-Roman Catholic Christianity and both of

them have dedicated (baptized) to the Church of Heavens Gate Church Galle, respectively on 25th

January 2015 - 5th June 2016.

Whilst referring to the provisions in Clause 3.2 referred to above the Petitioner has taken up the

position that the Southland College which originally belonged to the Methodist Church before it

being vested with the Government under the provisions of the Assisted Schools and Training Schools

(Special Provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary

Provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, had a non-Catholic, Christian students population of 6.9% of the total

students' population, and therefore her daughter is eligible to be admitted to Southland College

since she comes well within religious quota for the non-Catholic Christian students identified in the

said circular.

In the said circumstances, the Petitioner had taken up the position that the Respondents have failed

to admit 6.9% of non-Catholic Christian students from the total intake of students to the Grade 01

of Southland College in violation of her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution. To support her position the Petitioner had heavily relied on the decision in SC FR 613-

4 616/2024 SC minute dated 15.06.2005 by Shirani Bandaranayake J (as she then was) where her

Ladyship had observed that, A careful examination of paragraph 5 (a) of the circular therefore

clearly indicates that it is mandatory that the total number of vacancies should be first allocated as

contended by the learned counsel for the Petitioners to the different religions in the proportions

that existed at the time of vesting of schools and as specified under different categories in terms of

paragraph 5 (b) of the circular

On a careful perusal of the above judgment, it appears that the only selection criteria identified at

the time her Ladyship had delivered the said judgment based, on the school admission circular for

the year 2004 were paragraph 5 of the Circular which consist of two subparagraphs as 5 (a) and 5

(b) deals with the classification in admissions applicable to the school and admissions for certain

groups based on their religious faith taking into consideration the applicable percentage or as

commonly identified as religious quota.

However, since then several changes have been introduced to the said circular. In this regard, our

attention was drawn to Clause 3.1 of the guidelines, which separately identifies the number of

students that should be taken by the school by holding an interview and the allocation granted to

armed forces in each class.

Clause 3.1 reads as follows;

3.1 35 children will be selected for each parallel class in grade one by the interview. In

addition, 05 more children will be selected from among the children of those who

were in operation areas in armed forces and the police. Accordingly the number of

students per class will be 40. (Emphasis added)

The main argument of the Petitioner before this Court was based on the total number of children,

admitted to a class and based on the above the learned counsel for the Petitioner argued that the

religious quota should not be considered from 35 students but from 40 students since the judgment

he relied upon had specifically stated that, total number of vacancies should be first allocated..

However, as observed by this Court the interview process identified in the guidelines is only open

to 35 vacancies per class and therefore the religious quota can only apply to the said 35 students.

5 This position was considered by this Court in the case of M.U.F. Rizna and Another vs. P. P. W

Senevirathne, Principal, Vidyaloka College, Galle and Others SC FR 147/2018 SC minute 21.02.2022

as follows;

Section 4.1 of the said circular applicable for 2018 states;

33 children will be selected for each parallel class in Grade- 1. In addition, 05 more

children will be selected from among children of those who were in operation areas

in the Armed Forces and the Police.

The children of those who were in operation areas in the three Armed Forces and the Police are

not selected by interviews, but in accordance with the procedure stipulated in Section 13 of the said

circular. Therefore, the vacancies allocated to the said category are excluded from the total number

of vacancies for students selected by interviews for Grade-1. In terms of Section 4.1 of the said

circular, 33 children are to be selected by interviews for each class in Grade-1. The first Respondent

submitted that the said school has three (3) Grade -1 classes. Hence a total of ninety nine (99)

vacancies are available for students selected by interviews for Grade -1 in the Academic Year 2018.

Accordingly, when the 2% Muslim quota is applied to the ninety nine (99) vacancies two (2) vacancies

are available for Muslim applicants to Grade -1 of the said school.

In the above circumstances, it is clear that the religious quota applicable to the children who were

selected from the interview process has to be considered separate from the children who come

within the additional number of children admitted to Grade-1 from among children of those who

were in operation areas in the Armed Forces and the Police.

Therefore the argument of the Petitioner that the selection of 14 non-Catholic children based on

210 vacancies instead of 16 children based on 240 vacancies exist at Southland College violates the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner whose child is in 2nd place on the waiting list for non-Catholic

Christian children category does not hold water.

For completeness it is important to consider a letter produced by the 1st Respondent marked 1R2

addressed to the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence under the heading ls%hdka; moku u;

rcfha mdie,a j, m<uq fY%aKshg orejka we;=,;a lsu -2022

Under paragraph 3 of the said letter the attention was drawn to the religious quota when selections

are made to Grade -1 in the following terms;

mdie,a weuqKqu 02 hgf;a fhduq lrk njo je rh;a okajd is'

And under Annexure 02 reference is made to Southland College as follows;

06370 SOUTHLAND COLLEGE FORT-GALLE Non-Catholic Cristian 6.90%

When the contents of the above letter are considered, it is clear, that the education authorities are

mindful of maintaining the religious quota even concerning the children who are admitted through

a different process identified in Clause 07 of the guidelines.

In the circumstances, the child of the Petitioner namely Abeythunga Kankanam Gamachchige

Sasadara was not entitled to be admitted to Grade -1 of Southland College Galle under the non-

Catholic Cristian category for the year 2022.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner's fundamental rights had not been violated by

the Respondents. The application is dismissed.

I order no costs.
