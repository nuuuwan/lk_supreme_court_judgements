his  position  was  considered  by  this  Court  in  the  case  of  M.U.F.  Rizna  and  Another  vs.  P.  P.  W"
"Senevirathne, Principal, Vidyaloka College, Galle and Others SC FR 147/2018 SC minute 21.02.2022"
"as follows;"
"‘’Section 4.1 of the said circular applicable for 2018 states;"
"“33 children will be selected for each parallel class in Grade- 1. In addition, 05 more"
"children will be selected from among children of those who were in operation areas"
"in the Armed Forces and the Police."
"The ‘children of those who were in operation areas in the three Armed Forces and the Police’ are"
"not selected by interviews, but in accordance with the procedure stipulated in Section 13 of the said"
"circular. Therefore, the vacancies allocated to the said category are excluded from the total number"
"of  vacancies  for  students  selected  by  interviews  for  Grade-1.  In  terms  of  Section  4.1  of  the  said"
"circular, 33 children are to be selected by interviews for each class in Grade-1. The first Respondent"
"submitted  that  the  said  school  has  three  (3)  Grade  -1  classes.  Hence  a  total  of  ninety  nine  (99)"
"vacancies are available for students selected by interviews for Grade -1 in the Academic Year 2018."
"Accordingly, when the 2% Muslim quota is applied to the ninety nine (99) vacancies two (2) vacancies"
"are available for Muslim applicants to Grade -1 of the said school.’’"
"In the above circumstances, it is clear that the religious quota applicable to the children who were"
"selected  from  the  interview process  has  to  be  considered  separate  from  the  children  who  come"
"within the additional number of children admitted to Grade-1 from among children of those who"
"were in operation areas in the Armed Forces and the Police."
"Therefore the argument of the Petitioner that the selection of 14 non-Catholic children based on"
"210 vacancies instead of 16 children based on 240 vacancies exist at Southland College violates the"
"fundamental rights of the Petitioner whose child is in 2nd place on the waiting list for non-Catholic"
"Christian children category does not hold water."
"For completeness it is important to consider a letter produced by the 1st Respondent marked 1R2"
"addressed to the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence under the heading “ls%hdkaú; moku u;"
"rcfha mdie,a j, m<uq fY%aKshg orejka we;=,;a lsÍu -2022”"
"Under paragraph 3 of the said letter the attention was drawn to the religious quota when selections"
"are made to Grade -1 in the following terms;"
