The 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 1st defendant) in this case preferred an appeal to this Court challenging the decision of the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy, in granting Rs. 250,000 as damages to the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) in terms of the Estate Quarters (Special Provisions) Act No.2 of 1971. 2. The plaintiff in this case has been an Ayurvedic Practitioner. He has been appointed as the estate doctor on a service of contract. In terms of the service of contract, the plaintiff has been provided with official quarters. By letter dated 27.09.2008 (at page 345 of the brief), the plaintiff has been noticed that his services on contract would be expired on 30.11.2008, and was asked to hand over the official quarters. Thereafter, on an appeal made by the plaintiff, his service of contract has been extended by a further month until 31.12.2008 (page 346 of the brief). Admittedly, the plaintiff has continued to reside at the official quarters even after he was asked to hand over possession of the same. Thereafter, the defendants have interrupted the electricity supply of the appellant. 3. The plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Nuwara Eliya against the 1st defendant that is the Kelani Valley Plantations, and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Respondents-Respondents (2nd and 3rd defendants) who were Estate Superintendents of the 1st defendant estate.",

In the District Court, as the 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant had failed to file the answer within the specified time, the trial has been fixed exparte between the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant. At this point, the plaintiff has withdrawn his claim against the 3rd defendant despite there being specific allegations on him. Upon these circumstances, the plaintiff has tendered unchallenged evidence to Court. 6. The learned District Judge, by her judgment dated 30.08.2016, dismissed the plaint of the plaintiff. Aggrieved by the decision of the learned District Judge, the plaintiff preferred an appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy. 7. The High Court, by judgment dated 30.07.2019 set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge. The appeal of the plaintiff was partially allowed. The learned Judges of the High Court granted the only relief () in which the plaintiff prayed for damages in a sum of Rs. 500,000 for the termination of his services and interrupting the electricity supply and held that, the plaintiff was entitled to damages in a sum of Rs. 250,000 in terms of section 2 of the Estate Quarters (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1971 for the hardships faced due to the disconnection of the power supply.",
