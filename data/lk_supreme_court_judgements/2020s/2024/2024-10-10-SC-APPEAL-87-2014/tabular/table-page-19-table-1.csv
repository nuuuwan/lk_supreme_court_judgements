"47. What Article 13(6) of the Constitution seeks to achieve is to confer a fundamental"
"right which serves as a protection against retroactive or ex post facto application of"
"criminal laws. It is to ensure that, a person is subject to criminal justice measures only"
"if  the  impugned  conduct  constituted  an  offence  at  the  time  the  alleged  conduct  or"
"illegal omission took place (first part of Article 13(6) – Nullum crimen sine lege), and"
"that he is punished (penal sanctions imposed) only to the extent such punishment had"
"been prescribed by law at the time the offence was committed (second part of Article"
"13(6) – Nulla poena sine lege). That is how Article 13(6) seeks to confer protection against"
"retroactive application of criminal laws. [As the proviso to Article 13(6) shows, there"
"is a well-recognised exception to this principle.]"
