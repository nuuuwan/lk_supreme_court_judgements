"Submissions of the learned counsel for the Appellant"
"12. Learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  that  the  powers  of  sentencing  of  a"
"Magistrate’s Court are contained in section 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,"
"No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the CCPA’). He further submitted that the"
"learned Magistrate had imposed a default sentence of six months imprisonment with"
"regard to the order to pay compensation of Rs. 75,000.00 to the virtual complainant."
"He submitted that therefore the order made for the payment of Rs. 75,000.00 “is not"
"mere compensation” and should be treated as a fine. In terms of section 14 of the CCPA,"
"the maximum fine which a Magistrate is empowered to impose is One Thousand Five"
"Hundred Rupees (Rs. 1,500.00). Thus, the learned Magistrate had exceeded that upper"
"limit and therefore acted in contravention of section 14 of the CCPA."
