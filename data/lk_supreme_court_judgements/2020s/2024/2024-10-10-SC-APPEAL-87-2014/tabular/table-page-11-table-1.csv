"","This amendment came into operation on the date on which the Speaker certified the"
"","enactment, that being the 31st May 2005. What this amendment has provided for is to"
"","raise the maximum limit of compensation a Magistrate is entitled to order from Five"
"Hundred Rupees (Rs. 500.00) to One Hundred Thousand Rupees (Rs. 100,000.00).",""
"33. During  the  hearing,  both  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  and  the  Respondents",""
"","agreed with each other that, the order made by the learned Magistrate for the payment"
"","of  compensation  of  Seventy-Five  Thousand Rupees  to the virtual complainant  was"
"","founded upon the enhanced power conferred on a Magistrate to order the payment"
"","of  compensation  by  the  amended  section  17(7),  introduced  by  Act,  No.  14  of  2005."
"","Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Magistrate could not"
"","have  relied  on  the  amended  section  17(7)  of  the  CCPA  as  having  done  so  was  in"
"","contravention of Article 13(6) of the Constitution since Act, No. 14 of 2005 was not in"
"","operation at the time of the committing of the offence on 5th July 1993. The submission"
"","of the learned DSG was two-fold. First, she submitted that, an order for the payment"
"","of  compensation  does  not  amount  to  a  ‘penalty’,  and  hence,  Article  13(6)  had  no"
"","applicability. Second, she submitted that, even if this Court were to conclude that the"
"","order  for  the  payment  of  compensation  amounts  to  a  ‘penalty’  (for  the  purpose  of"
"","Article 13(6)) and therefore Article 13(6) was applicable, it was well within the power"
"","of the learned Magistrate to have relied on the enhanced power conferred on him by"
"the  amended  section  17(7),  as  the  said  provision  of  the  law  was  a","‘procedural"
"","provision’  which  could  be  applied  prospectively,  as  the  relevant  amendment  had"
"","been introduced by Parliament and came into operation after criminal proceedings"
"","were instituted against the Appellant on 6th October 2005. Thus, she submitted that"
"the 
learned  Magistrate  had  not  acted","in  contravention  of  Article  13(6)  of 
the"
"Constitution.",""
"34. In view of the foregoing, the issues to be determined by this Court are as follows:",""
"","a)  For  the  purposes  of  Article  13(6)  of  the  Constitution,  does  an  order  for  the  payment  of"
"compensation amount to a ‘penalty’?",""
