"SC Appeal 87/2014 - Judgment"
"providing reparation to the victim of crime is an objective of criminal justice and a"
"form of punishment which a criminal court should necessarily consider imposing. In"
"this regard, it is important to note that both the Assistance to and Protection of Victims"
"of  Crime  and  Witnesses  Act,  No.  4  of  2015  (repealed)  and  Act,  No.  10  of  2023"
"(presently in force under the same title) provides a more comprehensive mechanism"
"pertaining to the determination, ordering and payment of compensation to victims of"
"crime, following criminal justice proceedings in both the Magistrateâ€™s Court and the"
"High Court."
