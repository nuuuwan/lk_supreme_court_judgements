"SC Appeal 87/2014 - Judgment"
"‘compensation’ is paid, it is given to the aggrieved party (victim of crime) which in"
"this instance was the virtual complainant (first witness for the prosecution). It would"
"also be seen that ‘compensation’ as provided in section 16 of the CCPA is distinctly"
"different to ‘compensation’ that is recoverable by a plaintiff following the successful"
"completion of civil proceedings. That is primarily because an order for the payment"
"of  ‘compensation’  is made  by  a  court  exercising  criminal  jurisdiction  following  the"
"conviction of an accused for having committed an ‘offence’, as opposed to a finding"
"by a civil court that the defendant is responsible for having committed an actionable"
"wrong.  As  the  order  for  the  payment  of  compensation  is  made  following  a  person"
"having  been  accused  of  having  committed  an  offence  and  thereafter  having  been"
"found ‘guilty’ and therefore convicted of having committed such offence or dealt with"
"otherwise without entering a conviction [vide section 17(4)], the order for the payment"
"of compensation amounts to a ‘penal sanction’ alias ‘punishment’. Though the object"
"and purpose of an order for the payment of ‘compensation’ is to provide reparation"
"to the victim of crime, it is punitive in nature, particularly as recovery of compensation"
"can be carried out as if it were a ‘fine’, and since a default sentence of imprisonment"
"can be ordered as a consequence of non-payment. Therefore, in this context, the term"
"‘penalty’ should be treated as a synonym for the term ‘punishment’. To that extent,"
"I find myself in agreement with the submission made in that regard by the learned"
"counsel for the Appellant."
