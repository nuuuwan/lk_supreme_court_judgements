Amarasekara, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: P K Prince Perera with Madushi Pitiyawatta and Ishani Herath for the Respondent Respondent Petitioner P A D Kumarawickrema for the 1st 4th and 6th 16th Applicants Appellants Respondents Supported on: 11th December 2023 Written Tendered by the 1st 4th and 6th 16th Applicants Appellants Submissions: Respondents on 2nd January 2024

Tendered by the Respondent Respondent Petitioner on 8th February 2024 Decided on: 15th February 2024 Obeyesekere, J

The 1st 4th and 6th 16th Applicants Appellants Respondents [the Respondents] who

were employees of the Respondent Respondent Petitioner [the Petitioner] invoked

the jurisdiction of the Labour of Tribunal of Colombo in terms of Section 31B(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act as amended [the Act] claiming that their services have been

unjustifiably terminated by the Petitioner on 3rd May 2010, and seeking compensation for

loss of employment. With the agreement of the parties, all applications, sixteen in

number, had been consolidated.

7

By its Order delivered on 24th August 2017, the Labour Tribunal had dismissed all sixteen

applications. Aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondents had filed an appeal in the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo [the High Court], in

terms of Section 31D(3) of the Act. The said appeal had been allowed by the High Court

by its judgment delivered on 13th December 2019.

Section 31DD(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, as amended stipulates that, Any

workman, trade union or employer who is aggrieved by any final order of a High Court

established under Article 154P of the Constitution, in the exercise of the appellate

jurisdiction vested in it by law or in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction vested in it

by law, in relation to an order of a labour tribunal, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme

Court with the leave of the High Court or the Supreme Court first had and obtained.

Dissatisfied with the said judgment of the High Court, the Petitioner filed this application

on 5th February 2020. When this matter was taken up for support on 11th December 2023,

the learned Counsel for the Respondents raised a preliminary objection with regard to

the maintainability of this application on the basis that the petition of appeal has been

filed out of time. The learned Counsel for the Respondents, referring to Rule 7 of the

Supreme Court Rules (1990) made under Article 136 of the Constitution [the Rules]

submitted that (a) the time period allowed to file a petition of appeal against a judgment

of the High Court arising from an order of the Labour Tribunal is six weeks; (b) the said

time period of six weeks is mandatory; and (c) failure to file a petition of appeal within

the said time period of six weeks would render this application liable to be dismissed in

limine.

In Priyanthi Chandrika Jinadasa v Pathma Hemamali and Others [(2011) 1 Sri LR 337]

Chief Justice Bandaranayake, having considered the provisions of Rule 7 of the Supreme

Court Rules (1990), held as follows at page 346:

As clearly stated in L.A. Sudath Rohana v Mohamed Zeena and Others [SC HC CA LA

No. 111/2010 SC Minutes of 17.3.2011] Rules of the Supreme Court are made in

terms of Article 136 of the Constitution, for the purpose of regulating the practice

8

and procedure of this Court. Similar to the Civil Procedure Code, which is the principal

source of procedure, which guides the Courts of civil jurisdiction, the Supreme Court

Rules regulates the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court.

The language used in Rule 7, clearly shows that the provisions laid down in the said

Rule are mandatory and that an application for leave of this Court should be made

within six weeks of the order, judgment, decree or sentence of the Court below of

which leave is sought from the Supreme Court. In such circumstances it is apparent

that it is imperative that the application should be filed within the specified period

of six (6) weeks.

The position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was twofold. Whilst admitting that

this application has been filed 54 days after the delivery of the judgment of the High

Court, his first submission was that the delay was due to circumstances beyond the

control of the Petitioner, namely (a) the judgment of the High Court was not available

until 20th January 2020 and the Petitioner was able to obtain a copy of the said judgment

with the greatest difficulty, and (b) due to the appeal brief consisting of over 1200 pages.

It must however be noted that the Petitioner has paid the money to obtain a certified

copy of the brief only on 17th January 2020, which means that the request for a copy of

the judgment was made only on that date and which thereby gives lie to the position of

the Petitioner that it obtained a copy of the said judgment with the greatest difficulty. It

must however be noted that even if it was so, neither the non-availability of the judgment

nor the fact that the appeal brief consisted over 1200 pages would have served as an

excuse for the delay, as the time periods allowed for the filing of appeals is mandatory

and any breach would render the application to be dismissed in limine. Be that as it may,

the Petitioner was not without a remedy for it could very well have pleaded its difficulty,

if such a difficulty existed at all, and sought permission of Court to tender such documents

on a later date, which the Petitioner failed to do.

The second submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that even though

Rule 7 is mandatory, the said Rule has no application to this petition and that the Rules of

this Court does not stipulate a mandatory time period to file an appeal against the

judgment of a High Court arising from an order of a Labour Tribunal. It was therefore his

9

position that the preliminary objection that the petition of appeal should have been filed

within six weeks is misconceived in law.

While provisions relating to applications for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court

from judgments of the Court of Appeal are contained in Part 1A of the Rules, provisions

relating to leave to appeal applications from other Courts including the High Court are

found in Part 1C thereof. Rule 7, which comes under Part 1A, provides that, Every such

application shall be made within six weeks of the order, judgment, decree or sentence of

the Court of Appeal in respect of which special leave to appeal is sought. However, Part

1C of the aforementioned Rules, which applies to this application, does not specify a time

period for the filing of leave to appeal applications.

An issue similar to what has arisen in this application arose in Asia Broadcasting

Corporation (Private) Limited vs Kaluappu Hannadi Lalith Priyantha [SC/HC/LA No.

50/2020; SC Minutes of 7th July 2021], where an objection that the petition of appeal

against the judgment of the High Court had been filed out of time was sought to be

resisted on the basis that the impugned application was seeking leave to appeal from a

judgment of the Provincial High Court and that as it was an application made under Part

1C, Rule 7 and the time period stipulated therein, had no application.

Surasena, J, having considered the long line of cases where this Court has held that the

time period specified in Rule 7 would nonetheless apply in respect of a leave to appeal

application filed in terms of Part 1C and Section 31DD(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act,

held that, notwithstanding the fact that the instant application for leave to appeal

from the judgment of the Provincial High Court would come under section C in Part I

namely Other Appeals, the provisions in Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 would

apply to decide the time frame within which such an application must be filed before this

Court.

The above judgment has been cited with approval in D.H. Waruna Priyanka v Commercial

Bank of Ceylon PLC [SC Spl L/A No. 86/2020; SC minutes of 12th December 2022].

10

It was therefore the position of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that any

application seeking leave to appeal from an order of the Labour Tribunal must be filed

within six weeks of the judgment of the High Court. He submitted further that with the

judgment of the High Court having been delivered on 13th December 2019, this

application ought to have been filed in the Registry of this Court on or before 24th January

2020. As I have noted earlier, this application had been filed only on 5th February 2020,

which, on the face of it, is clearly outside the six-week time period stipulated in Rule 7 of

the Supreme Court Rules.

In the above circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned

Counsel for the Respondents. Leave to appeal is accordingly refused and this application

is dismissed. I make no order with regard to costs.
