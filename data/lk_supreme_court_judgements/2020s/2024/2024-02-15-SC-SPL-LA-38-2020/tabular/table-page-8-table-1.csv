"of six (6) weeks.”"
"T
he position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was twofold. Whilst admitting that"
"this  application  has  been  filed  54  days  after  the  delivery  of  the  judgment  of  the  High"
"Court,  his  first  submission  was  that  the  delay  was  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the"
"control of the Petitioner, namely (a) the judgment of the High Court was not available"
"until 20th January 2020 and the Petitioner was able to obtain a copy of the said judgment"
"‘with the greatest difficulty’, and (b) due to the appeal brief consisting of over 1200 pages."
"It must however be noted that the Petitioner has paid the money to obtain a certified"
"copy of the brief only on 17th January 2020, which means that the request for a copy of"
"the judgment was made only on that date and which thereby gives lie to the position of"
"the Petitioner that it obtained a copy of the said judgment ‘with the greatest difficulty’. It"
"must however be noted that even if it was so, neither the non-availability of the judgment"
"nor the fact that  the appeal  brief  consisted  over  1200 pages would  have served  as an"
"excuse for the delay, as the time periods allowed for the filing of appeals is mandatory"
"and any breach would render the application to be dismissed in limine. Be that as it may,"
"the Petitioner was not without a remedy for it could very well have pleaded its difficulty,"
"if such a difficulty existed at all,  and sought permission of Court to tender such documents"
"on a later date, which the Petitioner failed to do."
