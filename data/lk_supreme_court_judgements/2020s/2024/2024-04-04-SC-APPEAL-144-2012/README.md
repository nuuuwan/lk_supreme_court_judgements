Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Galle on 17.06.1996

to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint among the

plaintiff and the 1st defendant in equal shares. At the preliminary survey,

the wife of the 1st defendant and another person claimed rights in the

land. They were made the 2nd and 3rd defendants. Only the 1st and 2nd

defendants filed statements of claim.

There is no corpus dispute. The 2nd defendants mother, Cecilia, became

entitled to the corpus (Lot B of Plan No. 586) by a partition decree. This

is the land to be partitioned in this case.

There is no pedigree dispute acceptable to Court.

The said Cecilia gifted an undivided half share on the eastern side of Lot

B to her daughter, the 2nd defendant, by Deed of Gift No. 3339 dated

05.03.1980 marked P5. Thereafter, Cecilia sold the other half share on

4

SC/APPEAL/144/2012

the western side to Somapala Ratnayake by Deed of Transfer No. 3023

dated 16.02.1981 marked P1.

Somapala by Deed of Transfer marked P2 dated 13.06.1981 transferred

it to Devapriya Mohotti who in turn transferred it to Nikulas Mohotti by

Deed of Transfer marked P3 dated 21.06.1994. Nikulas, who is the

plaintiffs father, transferred it to the plaintiff by Deed of Transfer marked

P4 dated 03.07.1995.

Although the 1st and 2nd defendants are husband and wife living in

harmony under one roof, the 2nd defendant wife sold her half share to her

husband by Deeds of Transfer marked P6 dated 07.11.1980 and P7 dated

03.06.1981.

The contention of the 1st and 2nd defendants before the District Court was

that they were entitled to the whole land by prescription despite the fact

that it is the 1st defendants mother-in-law and the 2nd defendants

mother who transferred the western half share of Lot B to the plaintiffs

predecessor.

The District Court refused the prescriptive claim of the 1st and 2nd

defendants and ordered partition of the land according to the aforesaid

pedigree. The High Court of Civil Appeal of Galle affirmed the said

judgment.

The 1st defendant came before this Court against the judgment of the

High Court. At the argument, learned counsel for the 1st defendant

confined his argument to the question of law, stated in paragraph 12(d)

to the petition, which reads as follows:

Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in holding that the defendant

had only led his evidence to prove prescription, whereas the

defendant was not permitted to bring evidence to prove prescription?

5

SC/APPEAL/144/2012

It is clear that the plaintiffs prescriptive claim for the entire land cannot

succeed on the facts and circumstances of this case.

There had been another partition action (8249/P) in the same District

Court for the larger land, which included Lot B (the subject matter of the

instant partition action). In the said partition action, the aforementioned

Devapriya Mohotti was the plaintiff, and the 1st defendant in the instant

case was the 2nd defendant. Cecilia was the 4th defendant.

According to P10 marked through the 1st defendant himself, an interim

settlement was recorded in that case on 30.09.1981 between the plaintiff

and the 1st defendant in the instant case whereby the 1st defendant had

agreed to possess only the eastern half of Lot B, allowing Devapriya

Mohotti to possess the western half of Lot B. This settlement is in line

with the title deeds of the parties. This settlement was recorded when

both parties were fully represented by their respective lawyers. Both

parties have signed the case record signifying the settlement. According

to the judgment marked P8, the said partition action was dismissed on

03.11.1993 mainly on the basis that defined portions of land had been

included in the land to be partitioned. In the judgment, the undivided

rights of the present plaintiff and the present 1st defendant to Lot B had

also been acknowledged. No one has appealed against that judgment.

This demonstrates that at least from 30.09.1981 to 03.11.1993, a period

of 12 years, both the plaintiff and the 1st defendant possessed the corpus

in equal shares upon a settlement.

The instant partition action was filed on 17.06.1996, i.e. less than 3 years

after the dismissal of the said partition case.

In the evidence, the 1st defendant admitted that the plaintiff was living

on the land opposite to the land to be partitioned (page 64 of the brief).

The plaintiff has not abandoned his rights to the land to be partitioned.

6

SC/APPEAL/144/2012

The 1st defendant in his evidence stated that he was a process server in

a Court (page 69 of the brief). In the aforesaid settlement marked P10

also his address indicates that he was employed in the Family Court of

Galle (page 135 of the brief). The 1st defendant seems to be stating that

he did not honour the aforesaid undertaking given to Court (settlement)

regarding possession. Employment in Court is not a license to take the

law into ones own hands.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance determines the mode of

acquisition of the prescriptive title. It requires the defendant to prove

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the plaintiff for ten years prior to the bringing of

the action.

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a

defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands

or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that

of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of

service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly

and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of

such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with

costs. And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action,

or any third party shall intervene in any action for the purpose of

being quieted in his possession of lands or other immovable

property, or to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to

establish his claim in any other manner to such land or other

property, proof of such undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

as herein before explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient, or by

7

SC/APPEAL/144/2012

those under whom he claims, shall entitle such plaintiff or

intervenient to a decree in his favour with costs:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run

against parties claiming estates in remainder or reversion from the

time when the parties so claiming acquired a right of possession to

the property in dispute.

The 1st defendant has failed to prove these ingredients.

Both the District Court and the High Court were correct in holding that

the plaintiffs prescriptive claim cannot be successful.

Proof of prescriptive title against the real owner is difficult. Proof of

prescriptive title against co-owners is more difficult. Unless the contrary

is proved by cogent evidence, possession of one co-owner is in law the

possession of the other co-owners. (Corea v. Iseris Appuhamy (1911) 15

NLR 65, Sediris Appuhamy v. James Appuhamy (1958) 60 NLR 297 at

302-303, Rajapaksha v. Hendrick Singho (1959) 61 NLR 32, Maria Perera

v. Albert Perera [1983] 2 Sri LR 399, Wickremaratne and Another v.

Alpenis Perera [1986] 1 Sri LR 190 at 195, Maria Fernando v. Anthony

Fernando [1997] 2 Sri LR 356)

The 1st defendants complaint that the District Court did not give him a

date to call further witnesses and therefore he could not properly

establish prescriptive title against all other co-owners cannot be accepted

in the unique facts and circumstances of this case.

I answer the question of law in the negative and dismiss the appeal with

costs.
