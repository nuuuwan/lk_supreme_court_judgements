"P. PADMAN SURASENA, J."
"C
ourt  heard  the  submissions  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  as  well  as  the"
"submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General and concluded the argument."
"T
he 1st Petitioner is the mother of the 2nd Petitioner who is a minor and whose admission was"
"sought to the school of which the 1A Respondent is the Principal.  The 1st Respondent has"
"produced (marked 1R2), the application made by 1st Petitioner seeking the admission of her"
"child (the 2nd Petitioner) to the above school from the “close proximity category”.  According"
"to the said application (1R2), the address of the permanent residence of the Petitioners is"
"mentioned as No. 78/E Gangarama Road, Urawatta, Ambalangoda."
"The  1st  Petitioner  has  also  produced  the  Deed  (marked  P4)  and  the  plan  relevant  to  the"
"property (marked P14). The Petitioners’ residential premises is depicted as Lot X in Plan No."
"2134/2015 (P14) in which two permanent buildings marked “P” have been clearly depicted."
"It is important to note that both the permanent buildings are situated within the afore-said"
"Lot X."
"I
t is not disputed between parties that there are two houses in the Petitioners’ compound:"
"one an old house; the other, a newly constructed house."
"W
e  observe  that  the  1st  Petitioner  has  claimed  her  entitlement  to  admit  her  child,  the  2nd"
"Petitioner on the basis that they are living in house No. 78/E (old house)."
"The learned Deputy Solicitor General conceded before this Court that if in fact the Petitioners"
"are living in the old house, the school authorities must admit the 2nd Petitioner to the relevant"
"school. Thus, the issue we have to decide is whether the Petitioners are entitled to succeed"
"with their application for the admission to the relevant school on the basis of their claim that"
"they  live  in  the  address  provided  in  the  application  they  had  submitted.  i.e.  No.  78/E,"
"Gangarama Road, Urawatta, Ambalangoda."
"Although, the learned Deputy Solicitor General concedes that the child must be admitted if"
"the Petitioners’ family is living in the old house, the school authorities had not admitted the"
"child.  The  reason  provided  to  this  Court  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  not"
"admitting the 2nd Petitioner to the school is the fact that the Petitioners’ family is in fact living"
