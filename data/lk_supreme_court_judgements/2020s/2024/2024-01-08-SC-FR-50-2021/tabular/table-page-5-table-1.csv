"in the newly constructed house and not in the old house.   Moreover, it is the submission of"
"the learned Deputy Solicitor General that the distance to the school was measured from the"
"newly  constructed  house  as  that  was  the  premises  shown  by  the  Petitioners  to  the  school"
"authorities."
"A
t the outset, we need to state here that, so long as both premises (the old house and the"
"new house) and the land on which those houses are situated, are owned by the 1st Petitioner;"
"so long as there is no other family living in any of those two houses; so long as the Petitioners"
"have  submitted  the  other  relevant  documents  such  as  Water  Bills,  Electoral  Registers  &"
"Electricity  Bills,  it  should  be  irrelevant  for  the  school  authorities  to  go  on  the  voyage  of"
"discovery as to which part of the premises owned by the Petitioners’ is actually occupied by"
"the  Petitioners’  family.  Indeed,  it  is  not  disputed  that  the  school  authorities  have  awarded"
"marks for those documents submitted by the Petitioners.  However, we wish to add a caution"
"that the position might have been different if another family is found living in one of those"
"houses. In the absence of any other family living in any of these houses, we have no basis to"
"hold that the 1st Petitioner, for the purposes of the application for the admission of her child"
"to the relevant school, is not occupying the old house."
"T
he  Petitioners  are  relying  on  the documents  produced  (marked  Y19  and  Y20)  to  further"
"establish this fact."
"A
ccording to these two documents, the old house is a house which is 35 years old and is the"
"house which has been assigned the Assessment No. 78E.   Those two documents also establish"
"that the new house has not been assigned any Assessment Number."
"It appears from the document Y19 that the new house has been constructed without a proper"
"approval from the Rajgama Pradeshiya Sabha.  Indeed, the document Y20 states (a letter by"
"the  Divisional  Secretariat,  Madampagama)  that  it  is  not  certain  as  to  which  house  of  the"
"compound has been assigned the Assessment No. 78E."
"I
n the factual circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the Petitioners are free to"
"reside in any of the houses they own. As to which portion of their properties (in the same"
"compound)  the  Petitioners  must  reside  should  not  be  a  serious  matter  for  the  school"
"authorities to decide on the application to admit the child particularly in view of the fact that"
"no other family is occupying any of those houses as has already been mentioned earlier."
