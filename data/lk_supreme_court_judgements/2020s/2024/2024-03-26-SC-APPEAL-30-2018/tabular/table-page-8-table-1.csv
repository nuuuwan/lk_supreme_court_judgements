"","(a) Whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High"
"","Court of Uva Province Holden in Badulla have erred in law"
"","by  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Plaintiff  in  the"
"","instant case has failed to establish the pedigree set out in"
"","the Plaint with sufficient evidence?"
"9.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the"
"","appellant  has  duly  established  the  pedigree  based  on  which"
"","the title to the subject matter is devolved on the parties. The"
"","witness Kosala Ajantha Hettiarachchi called on behalf of the 6th"
"","Defendant-Respondent, 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
cross"
"","examination by the appellant, has expressly admitted that the"
"","6th Defendant-Respondent has no title to the land sought to be"
"","partitioned, and that rights on the land are claimed only in the"
"","capacity  of  a  lessee  (at  page  339  of  the  brief).  The  appellant"
"","further  states  that  the  6th  Defendant-Respondent  failed  to"
"","produce any lease agreement based on which they claimed the"
"","subject matter."
