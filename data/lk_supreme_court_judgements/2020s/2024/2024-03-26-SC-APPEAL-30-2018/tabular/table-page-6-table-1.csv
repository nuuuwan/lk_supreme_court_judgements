"","and  5th  defendants  filed  a  joint  statement  of  claim,  upon  an"
"","application  being  made  by  them,  they  were  discharged  from"

the  6th  Defendant-"

"5.","It  is  the  position  of  the  6th  Defendant-Appellant-Respondent"
"","(hereinafter referred to as the 6th Defendant-Respondent) that,"
