"Magilin Silva [1989] 2 SLR 105."
"“Section  16(1)  of 
the  Partition 
law 
requires 
that  a"
"commission  be 
issued  ""to  a  surveyor  directing  him  to"
"survey the land to which the action relates"". It implies that"
"the  land  surveyed  must  conform  substantially,  with  the"
"land as described in the plaint (and in respect of which a"
"lis pendens has been registered), as regards the location,"
"boundaries  and  the  extent.  Further,  it  is  for  this  reason"
"that section 18(1)(a)(iii) requires the surveyor to express an"
"opinion in his report."
"“whether or not the land surveyed by him is substantially"
"the same as the land sought to be partitioned as described"
"in the schedule to the plaint"". Considering the finality and"
"conclusiveness that attach in terms of section 48 (1) of the"
"Partition Law to the decrees in a partition action, the Court"
"should insist upon a due compliance with the requirement"
"by the surveyor."
"If  the  land  surveyed  is  substantially  different  from  the"
"land as described in the schedule to the plaint, the Court"
"has to decide at that stage whether to issue instructions"
"to the surveyor to carry out a fresh survey in conformity"
"with  the  commission  or  whether  the  action  should  be"
"proceeded with in respect of the land as surveyed.”"
