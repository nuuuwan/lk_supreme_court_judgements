"22.  When considering  the submission of the learned Counsel for"
"the  6th  Defendant-Respondent  that  there  is  no  evidence  to"
"show that  Doreisamy Kadirawel Logiah  was  the only  child of"
"Perumal Naidu Doreisamy Kanakapulle, it is my position that,"
"the non-existence of a fact cannot be proved. It is impossible"
"for the appellant to prove the non-existence of other children"
"of Perumal Naidu Doreisamy Kanakapulle. If at all, it is for the"
"6th Defendant-Respondent to prove the existence of any such"
"children.  However,  as  there  is  no  evidence  to  that  effect,  the"
"fact  that  the  land  in  question  devolved  on  the  only  son  of"
"Perumal Naidu Doreisamy Kanakapulle can be accepted by this"
"Court."
