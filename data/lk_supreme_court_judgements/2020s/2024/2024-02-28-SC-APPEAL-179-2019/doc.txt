Samayawardhena, J.

The original petitioner instituted these proceedings in the District Court

of Kuliyapitiya in terms of section 528 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking

letters of administration to administer the intestate estate of the deceased

on the basis that she is the widow of the deceased. She tendered the

marriage certificate marked P1 with the petition. The original 2nd

respondent who is the brother of the deceased (with the support of the

other siblings) countersued for letters of administration on the basis that

the marriage between the petitioner and the deceased is a nullity in terms

of section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance, No. 19 of 1907, as

amended, since the petitioner married the 2nd respondents deceased

brother without having her former marriage dissolved by a competent

Court.

Section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance enacts:

No marriage shall be valid where either of the parties thereto shall

have contracted a prior marriage which shall not have been legally

dissolved or declared void.

Section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance enacts:

19(1) No marriage shall be dissolved during the lifetime of the parties

except by judgment of divorce a vinculo matrimonii pronounced in

some competent court.

6

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

(2) Such judgment shall be founded either on the ground of adultery

subsequent to marriage, or of malicious desertion, or of incurable

impotence at the time of such marriage.

Section 607 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for a spouse to institute

an action in the District Court seeking a declaration that the marriage is

a nullity on any ground that results in the marriage between the parties

being deemed void under the laws of Sri Lanka. It was held in Peiris v.

Peiris [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 55 that this includes the application of Roman

Dutch law which recognises inter alia duress, mistake, fraud and

immaturity as grounds on which nullity of marriage can be sought. In

Seneviratne v. Premalatha (SC/APPEAL/211/2012, SC Minutes of

02.05.2016) it was observed that a party can invoke section 607 against

his or her spouse whose has entered into the marriage with that party

without having his or her former marriage dissolved by an order of Court.

607(1) Any husband or wife may present a plaint to the Family Court

within the local limits of the jurisdiction of which he or she (as the

case may be) resides, praying that his or her marriage may be

declared null and void.

(2) Such decree may be made on any ground which renders the

marriage contract between the parties void by the law applicable to

Sri Lanka.

Section 608 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for a dissolution of

marriage on separation a mensa et thoro for a specified period identified

in the section. However, it was held in Tennakoon v. Tennakoon [1986] 1

Sri LR 90 that the words either spouse in section 608(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code must be understood as referring only to the innocent

spouse for the purpose of the relief of divorce under section 608(2)(a) or

7

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

section 608(2)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code. The necessity to prove a

matrimonial fault has not been done away with.

608(1) application for a separation a mensa et thoro on any ground

on which by the law applicable to Sri Lanka such separation may be

granted, may be made by either husband or wife by plaint to the

Family Court, within the local limits of the jurisdiction of which he or

she, as the case may be, resides, and the court, on being satisfied

on due trial of the truth of the statements made in such plaint, and

that there is no legal ground why the application should not be

granted, may decree separation accordingly.

(2) Either spouse may-

(a) after the expiry of a period of two years from the entering

of a decree of separation under subsection (1) by a Family

Court, whether entered before or after the 15th day of

December,1977, or

(b) notwithstanding that no application has been made under

subsection (1) but where there has been a separation a mensa

et thoro for a period of seven years,

apply to the Family Court by way of summary procedure for a decree

of dissolution of marriage, and the court may, upon being satisfied

that the spouses have not resumed cohabitation in any case referred

to in paragraph (a), or upon the proof of the matters stated in an

application made under the circumstances referred to in paragraph

(b), enter judgment accordingly:

Provided that no application under this subsection shall be

entertained by the court pending the determination of any appeal

8

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

taken from such decree of separation. The provisions of sections 604

and 605 shall apply to such a judgment.

As seen from the marriage certificate P1, the position of the petitioner

seems to be that since she did not hear from her former husband for more

than seven years, she contracted the second marriage.

The former husband was alive at the time of the second marriage and at

the inquiry before the District Court into the issuance of letters of

administration, the former husband gave evidence for the 2nd respondent.

The District Court refused to issue letters of administration to the

petitioner (sought on the basis that she is the widow of the deceased as

crystallised in the issues), and instead issued the same to the 2nd

respondent (as one of the heirs of the deceased).

On appeal, the High Court set aside the order of the District Court and

ordered trial de novo on the basis that the District Judge failed to

consider as to whether or not the marriage contracted between the

petitioner and the deceased was valid and lawful under and in terms of

section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance to be read with section 18 of the

Marriage Registration Ordinance.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court the respondents

have appealed to this Court.

Section 107 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

When the question is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is shown

that he was alive within thirty years, the burden of proving that he

is dead is on the person who affirms it.

Section 108 (as it stood prior to the amendment introduced by Act No.10

of 1988 whereby seven years was reduced to one year) runs as follows:

9

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

Provided that when the question is whether a man is alive or dead,

and it is proved that he has not been heard of for seven years by

those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive,

the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who

affirms it.

Sections 107 and 108 are complementary to each other in that the latter

is the proviso to the former. Both these sections fall under the chapter

Burden of Proof in the Evidence Ordinance.

In Davoodbhoy v. Farook (1959) 63 NLR 97 it was held that these two

sections do not enact a presumption of law or fact but only a rule of

evidence as to the burden of proof. Basnayake J. (as he then was) with

the agreement of Pulle J. at page 99 states:

It is essential to bear in mind that these two sections do not enact a

presumption of law or fact, but enact rules governing the burden of

proof like any one of the other rules that precede them. Section 107

enacts the rule and section 108 enacts the proviso to it. In one case

it is sufficient to show that the person about whom the question

has arisen was alive within thirty years, in the other it must be

proved that he has not been heard of for seven years by those who

would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive. These

sections regulate the burden of proof in a case in which one party

affirms that a person is dead and the other party that the same

person is alive, and the question for decision is whether the person

is dead or alive.

This was further explained at pages 100-101 in the following manner:

In a case where one party affirms that a person is dead and another

that he is alive, if a party produces evidence to the effect that he was

alive within thirty years then the person who affirms that he is dead

10

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

must prove that he is dead; but if the person who affirms that he is

dead instead of proving that he is dead leads evidence which proves

that he has not been heard of for seven years by those who would

naturally have heard of him if he had been alive then the person who

affirms that he is alive must prove that he is alive. So that in a case

where the question is whether a person is alive or dead and one

party affirms that he is dead and the other that he is alive and it is

in evidence that he was alive within thirty years the burden that lies

on the party that affirms that he is dead by virtue of section 107 to

prove that he is dead shifts by operation of section 108 to the party

that affirms that he is alive if it is proved that he has not been heard

of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him

if he had been alive.

But E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Vol II, Book I, pages

428-429, is not in favour of this dichotomy between presumption of fact

and law on the one hand and burden of proof on the other. He takes the

view that such difference is artificial:

The fact is that rules as to burden of proof and presumptions are so

involved together that it is artificial to separate a given situation and

to state that it is a pure rule of the burden of proof and not of a

presumption. Every rebuttable presumption in favour of one party

necessarily involves a rule as to burden of proof in the other and vice

versa.

Explaining the affinity between sections 107 and 108 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the learned author on page 430 states that section 107

creates a presumption of the continuance of life, and section 108

functions as a clause that supplements section 107.

11

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

Sections 107 and 108 must be read together, because the latter

section is a proviso to the earlier. Section 107 creates a legal

presumption of continuance of life, if nothing is shown to the

contrary. Section 108 is a proviso to section 107, so that if a man

has not been heard of for one year [after the amendment in 1988] by

those who would naturally have heard of him, had he been alive,

the presumption of continuance of life under section 107 ceases, and

the burden of proving him to be alive lies on the person asserting it

by denying the death.

It is seen that whereas section 107 is based on the presumption of

continuity of life, section 108 is based on the presumption of death.

In Hamy Vel Muladeniya v. Siyatu (1945) 46 NLR 95 Jayetileke J. states:

Under section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance when a person has not

been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have

heard of him if he had been alive the presumption of life ceases, and

the burden is shifted to the person who denies the death.

The High Court concedes that it is common ground that the second

marriage was contracted whilst the first marriage was still subsisting,

thereby rendering the second marriage null and void under section 18 of

the Marriage Registration Ordinance. Nevertheless, the High Court

thereafter takes the view that the second marriage can be given validity

by proper invocation of section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance, and that

the District Court had failed to consider it. This is a misdirection in law.

It is undisputed that under the Marriage Registration Ordinance, during

the subsistence of a marriage, a spouse cannot lawfully enter into

another marriage, and such subsequent marriage during the subsistence

of the former marriage is void. It must also be born in mind that

dissolution of marriage by a judgment of a competent Court under section

12

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

19(1) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance is necessary only during

the lifetime of the parties. If one party is dead, there is no need for

dissolution of marriage by an order of Court. Section 108 of the Evidence

Ordinance creates only a presumption of death.

As much as there is a strong affinity between section 107 and 108 of the

Evidence Ordinance, there is a strong affinity between section 108 of the

Evidence Ordinance and the exception to section 362B of the Penal Code.

Section 362B of the Penal Code provides:

Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in

which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the

life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment

of either description for a term which may extend to seven years,

and shall also be liable to fine.

The exception to this section states:

This section does not extend to any person whose marriage with

such husband or wife has been declared void by a court of competent

jurisdiction, nor to any person who contracts a marriage during the

life of a former husband or wife, if such husband or wife, at the lime

of the subsequent marriage, shall have been continually absent from

such person for the space of seven years and shall not have been

heard of by such person as being alive within that time:

Provided the person contracting such subsequent marriage shall,

before such marriage takes place, inform the person with whom such

marriage is contracted of the real state of facts, as far as the same

are within his or her knowledge.

Pattison v. Kalutara Special Criminal Investigation Bureau (1970) 73 NLR

399 is one case where the exception to section 362B of the Penal Code

13

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

was successfully invoked to defeat a criminal charge of bigamy. It was

held in this case:

Where, in a prosecution for bigamy, the defence of the accused is

based on the Exception to section 362B of the Penal Code, namely

that the accused who contracted a second marriage did not know

that his first wife had been alive at any time during the preceding

seven years, the burden is on the prosecution to prove knowledge on

the part of the accused that his first wife had been alive when he

contracted his second marriage.

Although there is a close correlation between section 108 of the Evidence

Ordinance and the exception to section 362B of the Penal Code, it shall

be born in mind that successful invocation of either section 108 of the

Evidence Ordinance or the exception to section 362B of the Penal Code

does not transform an invalid second marriage into a valid one.

In Fenton v. Reed (1809) 4 Johns 52 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) it was observed:

The statute concerning bigamy does not render the second marriage

legal, notwithstanding the former husband or wife may have been

absent above five years, and not heard of. It only declares that the

party who marries again, in consequence of such absence of the

former partner, shall be exempted from the operation of the statute,

and leaves the question on the validity of the second marriage just

where it found it.

In the case of Re Josephine Ratnayake (1921) 23 NLR 191, the wife filed

an action seeking a declaration that her husband is dead on the basis

that she did not hear from her husband for more than seven years. The

District Court dismissed the action. On appeal, De Sampayo J. affirmed

the judgment of the District Court and held:

14

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

This application is entirely misconceived. It is supposed to have been

in pursuance of section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance, which is

merely laying down a rule of evidence that, if a husband is absent

for a certain period without any information as to his whereabouts,

for certain purposes his death may be presumed. But nowhere is

there any provision laying down the procedure for obtaining a

declaration of Court. The only way that the section of the Evidence

Ordinance can be availed of is by repelling any charge of bigamy

that may be made against her if she marries again. But beyond that

that section does not help the appellant.

In Hamy Vel Muladeniya v. Siyatu (supra) it was held that Where a person

is presumed to be dead in accordance with the provisions of section 108 of

the Evidence Ordinance, his property may be divided among his heirs.

As was held in Davoodbhoy v. Farook (supra) that These sections

[sections 107 and 108] regulate the burden of proof in a case in which one

party affirms that a person is dead and the other party that the same

person is alive, and the question for decision is whether the person is dead

or alive. However, in the instant case there is no issue as to whether the

former husband of the petitioner was alive or dead at the time the

petitioner contracted the second marriage to the deceased: he was alive.

In the case of Parkash Chander v. Parmeshwari (AIR 1987 PH 37) it was

observed:

The presumption under S. 108 of the Evidence Act arises only when

the question is raised in Court as to whether a man is alive or dead

and such question is in issue. There is no presumption in this regard

unless such a proceeding comes in the Court and an issue in this

regard is raised. S.108 is only a rule of evidence and presumption is

15

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

drawn for purposes of reaching at a conclusion on the concerned

issue.

In certain jurisdictions, remarriage is legally recognised when one spouse

is believed to be deceased or has been absent and unheard of for a period

of years, typically ranging from three to seven. In such circumstances,

the second marriage is considered to be valid until held void by a Court

of competent jurisdiction.

In India, section 13(1)(vii) of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 provides that

a Hindu marriage can be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground

that the other party has not been heard of as being alive for a period of

seven years or more by those who would naturally have heard of that

party had they been alive. Similar provisions are found in section 27(h)

of the Special Marriage Act of 1954 in India.

Article 41 of the Family Code of the Philippines declares that a marriage

entered into by any individual while a previous marriage is still in effect

is considered null and void, unless, before the subsequent marriage, the

prior spouse has been absent for four consecutive years, and there exists

a well-founded belief that the absent spouse is deceased. However, for

the purpose of contracting the subsequent marriage, the present spouse

must initiate a summary proceeding, as provided in the Code, to declare

the presumptive death of the absentee, without prejudice to the

consequences of the absent spouses reappearance.

In the UK, in terms of sections 1 and 2 of the Presumption of Death Act

2013, where a person is thought to have died, or has not been known to

be alive for a period of at least seven years, any person may apply to the

High Court for a declaration that the missing person is presumed to be

dead. According to section 3(2), a declaration under this Act is effective

against all persons and for all purposes, including for the purposes of the

16

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

acquisition of an interest in any property, and the ending of a marriage

or civil partnership to which the missing person is a party.

There are no similar express provisions found in the Marriage

Registration Ordinance or any other statute in Sri Lanka that link the

presumption of death to remarriage.

The Tsunami (Special Provisions) Act, No. 16 of 2005 made provisions to

issue death certificates where persons resident in identified areas as at

26.12.2004 were found missing for six months from that date. Section 2

of the Act reads as follows:

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 108 of the Evidence

Ordinance, where any person, who had been resident in an area

referred to in the First Schedule to this Act as at December 26, 2004

or was known to have been in or travelling through such area on that

date, cannot be found and has not been heard of for six months since

that date by those who would normally have heard of such person

has such person been alive, and the disappearance is attributable

to the Tsunami that occurred on that date, the burden of proving that

such person is alive is on the person who affirms it.

Under our law, the presumption of death is not a ground for dissolution

of marriage.

Hence in terms of section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance, the

second marriage contracted with the deceased without the former

marriage having been dissolved by a decree of divorce from a competent

court is void. On the facts and circumstances of this case, section 108 of

the Evidence Ordinance has no application, and the High Court was in

error when it set aside the District Judges order on that ground and

ordered a retrial in order to consider the application of the original

petitioner in light of section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance.

17

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

This court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court

on the following questions of law:

1. Did the High Court err in law when it held that the question of the

second marriage could have been decided along with the provisions

of section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance despite section 18 of the

General Marriages Ordinance is clear on that issue?

2. Did the High Court err in law in ignoring section 19(1) of the General

Marriages Ordinance?

3. Did the High Court err in law by ordering a re-trial?

I answer the questions of law in the affirmative. I set aside the judgment

of the High Court and restore the order of the District Court dated

20.07.2011 and allow the appeal but without costs.

However, the judgment of the District Court is restored subject to the

condition that issue No. 11 raised by the respondents need not be decided

at this stage of the case. Issue No. 11 is: Should the property described

in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the statement of objections of the respondents be

included in the inventory in this case?

In terms of section 539(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, the inventory shall

be filed by the person to whom the Court decides to issue the probate or

letters of administration within a period of one month from the date of

taking the oath as the executor or administrator. When the Court is called

upon to decide to whom the probate or letters of administration shall be

issued, no time shall be wasted on inquiring into the correctness of the

details of the deceaseds property included in the original petition.

Although it is a requirement under section 528(1)(d) of the Civil Procedure

Code that the petitioner shall set out the details of the deceaseds

property in the petition, this is different from filing the inventory under

18

SC/APPEAL/179/2019

section 539(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Section 539(1) reads as

follows:

In every case where an order has been made, by a District Court

declaring any person entitled to have probate of a deceased persons

will, or administration of a deceased persons property granted to

him it shall be the duty of the said person, executor or administrator,

in whose favour such order is made, to take within fifteen days of

the making of such order, the oath of an executor or administrator

as set out in form No. 92 in the First Schedule, and thereafter to file

in court within a period of one month from the date of taking of the

oath, an inventory of the deceased persons property and effects,

with a valuation of the same as set out in form No. 92 in the First

Schedule and the court shall forthwith grant probate or letters of

administration, as the case may be.

At this stage, the question to be decided is to whom letters of

administration shall be issued and nothing else.
