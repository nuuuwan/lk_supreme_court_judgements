                                      14"
"This application is entirely misconceived. It is supposed to have been"
"in  pursuance  of  section  108  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  which  is"
"merely laying down a rule of evidence that, if a husband is absent"
"for a certain period without any information as to his whereabouts,"
"for  certain  purposes  his  death  may  be  presumed.  But  nowhere  is"
"there  any  provision 
laying  down  the  procedure  for  obtaining  a"
"declaration of Court. The only way that the section of the Evidence"
"Ordinance  can  be  availed  of  is  by  repelling  any  charge  of  bigamy"
"that may be made against her if she marries again. But beyond that"
"that section does not help the appellant."
