1. The instant case is an appeal against the dismissal of a revision application filed before

the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province Hoden in Colombo against an

order dated 09th February 2017 of the District Court of Colombo.

BACKGROUND OF THE CASE

2. The Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter Respondent) above named and

his mother, late Diasy Haththotuwa (ne Jayawardena), had obtained several loan

facilities from the Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant Bank (hereinafter

Appellant) by mortgaging the land and premises described in the Schedule to the

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 14

Petition of the Appellant. Due to the default of such mortgagees to settle the monies

due under the said mortgage bonds, the Board of Directors of the Appellant Bank had

unanimously adopted a resolution to auction the mortgaged property in order to recover

the outstanding sums.

3. After taking steps under the Peoples Bank Act, No. 32 of 1986 (hereinafter sometimes the

Act), the Bank had auctioned the property on 27th August 2000. As there were no

bidders at the said auction the Appellant Bank itself had purchased the said property on

a Certificate of Sale No. 408 dated 06th September 2000.

4. The position of the Appellant is that all rights, title and interest of the Respondent in the

said property was thereby vested with the Appellant and that the Respondent thereafter

wrongfully and unlawfully failed and neglected to hand over vacant and peaceful

possession of the said property to the Appellant.

5. On this basis, the Appellant had instituted a case against the Respondent by Petition

dated 22nd October 2003 in the District Court of Colombo bearing Case No. 6881/SPL

under and in terms of the Peoples Bank Act, No. 29 of 1961 as amended against the

Respondent and said Daisy Haththotuwa. During the pendency of this case, this Court

delivered the judgment in Ramachandra v. Hatton National Bank1 which changed the

paradigm which existed with respect to the parate execution of 3rd party mortgages.

6. The Appellant states that they withdrew the said District Court case, reserving the right

to file a new application, to consider the effects of the said judgment due to the

uncertainty created vis--vis parate execution of 3rd party mortgages by the same.

1 [2006] 1 Sri L.R. 393. Now overruled by Sunpac Engineers (Private) Ltd & Another v. DFCC Bank & 11 Others, SC Appeal 11/2021, SC Minutes of 13th November 2023

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 14

7. Subsequently, the Appellant had instituted a fresh case bearing No. DSP 261/2014 by

Petition dated 11th December 2014 in the District Court of Colombo under Section 29P

of the Peoples Bank Act as amended seeking an order for delivery of possession. The

Appellant states that, at the time of filing this second Petition, the original of the

aforementioned Certificate of Sale has been misplaced and/or lost subsequent to the

withdrawal of the earlier petition.

8. The Respondent contends that when the Appellant Bank passed the resolution to auction

the mortgaged property and attempted to auction the same, his mother, late Diasy

Haththotuwa (nee Jayawardena), instituted action bearing No. 5712/SPL in the District

Court of Colombo seeking to prevent the Appellant Bank from so auctioning the

property. The District Court had subsequently issued an enjoining order on 24th August

2000 preventing the Appellant from auctioning the property.

9. The Respondent further states that the Appellant carried out this auction in

contravention of this enjoining order, thus rendering the auction, as well as all other

actions pursuant thereto, illegal. However, neither the legality of the auction nor the

validity of the Certificate of Sale have been placed as questions before this Court.

10. Following the aforementioned 2014 Petition filed by the Appellant, the learned District

Judge has issued an order nisi in favour of the Appellant. However, at the conclusion of

the inquiry, the learned Judge has opted to dissolve the said order nisi by order dated

09th February 2016, on the basis that the Appellants case was already prescribed while

also taking into account the Appellants failure to produce the original certificate of sale.

11. Aggrieved by the said order of the District Court, the Appellant had filed a revision

application before the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province Holden in

Colombo. The High Court of Civil Appeal, by judgment dated 01st August 2019 has

dismissed the revision application without costs.

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 14

12. The learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal have found that the District Court

erred in its finding that the action was prescribed. The Judges have also found the failure

on the part of the Appellant to procedure the original Certificate of Sale to not be fatal

to the application.

13. However, despite the findings that the District Court had erred as such, the revision

application was yet rejected on the basis that the Respondent was in a position to

establish a prescriptive right over the said property as a period of 10 years had lapsed

when the Appellant filed the application in 2014.

14. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal, the Appellant

has preferred the instant appeal.

QUESTIONS OF LAW

15. On 17th February 2023, leave was granted on the questions of law set out hereinbelow,

with the fourth question being one raised by the learned Counsel for the Respondent as

a consequential question of law at that stage:

i. Whether their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law dismissing the

Application of the Petitioner on the basis that the Respondent is in a position to

establish a prescriptive right to the said property?

ii. Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law and fact by holding

that the proper remedy available for the Petitioner is to vindicate its title in a re-

vindicatio action?

iii. Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court misdirect themselves with regard

to the provisions contained in Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act, No. 32 of 1986

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 14

as amended, read together with provisions of Chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure

Code?

iv. Whether an application under Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act, No. 32 of 1986

could be considered as an action within the meaning of section 10 of the Prescription

Ordinance as well as under section 06 of the Civil Procedure Code.

ANALYSIS

16. As this appeal may be dispensed with based on the answers to the third and fourth

questions of law alone, I wish to first consider the same.

Third and Fourth Questions of Law

17. Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act, as amended by Peoples Bank (Amendment) Act No.

32 of 1986, provides as follows:

(1) The purchaser of any immovable property sold in pursuance of the preceding

provisions of this Act shall, upon application made to the District Court of

Colombo or the District Court having jurisdiction over the place where that

property is situate, and upon production of the certificate of sale issued in respect

of that property under section 29N, be entitled to obtain an order for delivery of

possession of that property.

(2) Every application under subsection (1) shall be made, and shall be disposed of,

by way of summary procedure in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XXIV

of the Civil Procedure Code; and on all documents filed for the purpose of each

such application and on all proceedings held thereupon

(3) Where any immovable property sold in pursuance of the preceding provision of

this Act in the occupancy of the debtor or of some person on his behalf or of

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 14

some person claiming under a titled created by the debtor subsequently to

the mortgage of the property to the Bank, the District Court shall order delivery

to be made by putting the purchaser or any person whom he may appoint to

receive possession on his behalf, in possession of the property.2

18. The Appellant highlighted that Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act refers to an

application, as can be observed above, whereas the Prescription Ordinance refers to

actions. Based on this, it was the Appellants position that an application to recover

possession under Section 29P of the Act was not an action within the meaning of the

Prescription Ordinance, thus making the Ordinance inapplicable vis--vis such

applications.

19. Per contra, the Respondent submitted that every application to a court for relief or

remedy obtainable through the exercise of the courts power of authority, or otherwise

to invite its interference, constituted an action.

20. Order for delivery of possession sought under Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act is

akin to an order under Section 287 or Section 288 of the Civil Procedure Code. This is

clearly set out in Section 29P(5) of the Peoples Bank Act, which provides,

Every order under subsection (3) or subsection (4) shall be deemed, as the case may

be, to be an order for delivery of possession made under section 287 or section 288

of the Civil Procedure Code, and may be enforced in like manner as an order so

made, the debtor and the purchaser being deemed, for the purpose of the application

of any provision of that Code, to be the judgment-debtor and judgment-creditor,

respectively.

2 Emphasis added

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 14

21. Section 287 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for the purchase of a fiscal sale to apply

to court for an order for delivery of possession, after the fiscal conveyance, when the

property sold is in the occupancy of the judgment-debtor or of some person on his

behalf, or some person claiming under a title created by judgment-debtor subsequent

to seizure. This Section, too, refers to an application by the purchaser.

22. Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act is also identical to Section 16 of the Recovery of

Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990.

23. Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code defines an action as a proceeding for the

prevention or redress of a wrong. Where Section 6 of the Code provides that [e]very

application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the exercise of courts power

or authority, or otherwise to invite its interference, constitutes action. Section 6 should be

read not as a definition of the term action but as an illuminative provision of the

definition already provided in Section 5.3

24. Many decisions of the past from this Court have discussed the meaning of the term and

what constitutes an action. While the authorities are less than straightforward, what

becomes abundantly clear is that while an action must disclose a cause of action,4 an

application need not. As defined in Section 5, cause of action is the wrong for the

prevention or redress of which an action may be brought.

25. An application under Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act or Section 16 of the Recovery

of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act can be made by a purchaser of a property

subjected to parate execution for the purpose of obtaining an order for possession

thereof. These provisions must necessarily be interpreted with reference to the purpose

3 See U.L. Abdul Majeed, A Commentary on Civil Procedure Code and Civil Law in Sri Lanka Vol. 1 (Revised 2nd edn, 2017) 74

4 See Section 40 of the Civil Procedure Code

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 14

of these Acts, which is to expedite the debt recovery process and related banking

activities.

26. The general purpose and nature of Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act was described by Samayawardhena, J. in DFCC Bank v. Warnakulasuriya

Chandima Prasad Rajitha Fernando5 as follows:

Under section 16(1), the Court is not expected to have a full trial or full inquiry and

make an order on the merits of the substantive case, if any. The Court makes a

perfunctory order for delivery of possession upon production of the certificate of sale.

The intervention of the Court is sought at this stage primarily to prevent the breach

of peace in the execution of a non-judicial order.

27. Furthermore, with regard to the nature of the procedure set out in Section 16 of the

Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, Samayawardhena, J. referred to

Jayasundera v. Hatton National Bank6 and Hatton National Bank v. Thejasiri

Gunethilake7 with approval and said that the entire chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure

Code on summary procedure is inapplicable and the limited function of the District Court

in this instance is to act as a court of execution in respect of an extra judicial order made

by the Board of Directors of the bank.8

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 14

28. It is to this limited extent that the provisions of Chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure Code

apply to proceedings under Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act.

29. While these views have been expressed with regards to Section 16 of the Recovery of

Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, they can be extended to the question at hand as

Section 29P of the Peoples Bank Act is identical and both Acts serve similar purposes.

30. As such, I am of the view that the procedure set out in Section 29P of the Peoples Bank

Act is not an action as contemplated in the Prescription Ordinance and Section 6 of the

Civil Procedure Code for it does not fall within the ambit of an application to a court for

relief or remedy.

31. To this extent, I am in agreement with the finding of the High Court of Civil Appeal that

The cause of action that had occurred to the Petitioner-Petitioner [the Appellant

Bank] against the Respondent-Respondent in respect of this loan transaction had

already come to an end after the auction. The cause of action does not exist anymore.

Therefore, the application made by the Petitioner-Petitioner to recover possession is

not an action within the meaning of the Prescription Ordinance, but a mere

application to recover possession under the Provisions of the Peoples Bank Act.9

32. Accordingly, the third and fourth questions of law are answered in the following manner:

Question of Law: Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court misdirect

themselves with regard to the provisions contained in Section 29P of the Peoples

Bank Act, No. 32 of 1986 as amended, read together with provisions of Chapter XXIV

of the Civil Procedure Code?

9 Judgment of WP/HCCA/COL/18/2016/RA dated 01 August 2019, at 3

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 14

Answer: As I cannot find any analyses on Chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure Code

which runs contrary to the above findings in the judgments of the High Court of

Civil Appeal, this question of law is answered in the negative.

Question of Law: Whether an application under Section 29P of the Peoples Bank

Act, No. 32 of 1986 could be considered as an action within the meaning of section

10 of the Prescription Ordinance as well as under section 06 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

Answer: In accordance with the findings hereinabove, this question, too, is

answered in the negative: An application under Section 29P Peoples Bank Act

cannot be considered an action within the meaning of Section 10 of the

Prescription Ordinance and Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code.

First Question of Law

33. Having found that an application under Section 29P Peoples Bank Act is not an action

within the meaning of Section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance, the High Court of Civil

Appeal had thereafter gone on to dismiss the revision application before it on the basis

that the Respondent was in a position to establish a prescriptive right.

34. This is a self-contradictory conclusion. Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance entitles a

defendant in any action to a decree in his favour where such defendant establishes

proof of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the land or immovable property

in suit by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such

action for a period longer than ten years.

35. If an application under Section 29P Peoples Bank Act is not an action within the meaning

of Section 10 of the Ordinance, it cannot be an action within the meaning of Section 3 of

the Ordinance.

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 14

36. Moreover, as the Appellant submitted, with the support of many judicial authorities,

evidence of mere possession is insufficient for the purpose of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. The Respondent has not set up a claim of prescriptive rights and adduced

evidence to that effect before the District Court.

37. Accordingly, I answer the first question of law in the affirmative. Learned Judges of the

High Court of Civil Appeal have erred in law dismissing the Application of the Petitioner

on the basis that the Respondent is in a position to establish a prescriptive right to the

said property.

Second Question of Law

38. The conclusion that the proper remedy would have been in an action rei vindicatio was

reached on the erroneous finding that the Respondent was in a position to establish

prescriptive rights.

39. As the answer to the first question of law was in the affirmative, the Appeal must be

allowed on that basis alone. Therefore, the answer to this question of law is

inconsequential.

40. I do not see it necessary to engage in the academic exercise of considering when a rei

vindication action must be preferred instead of an application under Section 29P Peoples

Bank Act.

CONCLUSION OF THE COURT

41. In view of the answers to the questions of law, the Appeal is allowed. Other objections

taken by the Respondent before the District Court have not been placed for

consideration before this Court.

SC Appeal 31/2023 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 14

42. Therefore, I set aside the order of the District Court of Colombo dated 09th February 2016

and the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 01st August 2019 and direct

the District Judge to make the order nisi entered in the said application absolute as

pleaded in paragraph (e) of the prayer to the Petition before this Court.

Appeal Allowed.
