"31.  To this extent, I am in agreement with the finding of the High Court of Civil Appeal that"
"“…The cause of action that had occurred to the Petitioner-Petitioner [the Appellant"
"Bank]  against  the  Respondent-Respondent  in  respect  of  this  loan  transaction  had"
"already come to an end after the auction. The cause of action does not exist anymore."
"Therefore, the application made by the Petitioner-Petitioner to recover possession is"
"not  an  action  within  the  meaning  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance,  but  a  mere"
"application to recover possession under the Provisions of the People’s Bank Act.”9"
