"36.  Moreover,  as  the  Appellant  submitted,  with  the  support  of  many  judicial  authorities,",""
"","evidence of mere possession is insufficient for the purpose of Section 3 of the Prescription"
"","Ordinance.  The  Respondent  has  not  set  up  a  claim  of  prescriptive  rights  and  adduced"
"","evidence to that effect before the District Court."
"37.  Accordingly, I answer the first question of law in the affirmative. Learned Judges of the",""
"","High Court of Civil Appeal have erred in law dismissing the Application of the Petitioner"
"","on the basis that the Respondent is in a position to establish a prescriptive right to the"

"","Second Question of Law"
"38.  The conclusion that the proper remedy would have been in an action rei vindicatio was",""
"","reached  on  the  erroneous  finding  that  the  Respondent  was  in  a  position  to  establish"
"","prescriptive rights."
"39.  As  the  answer  to  the  first  question  of  law  was  in  the  affirmative,  the  Appeal  must  be",""
"","allowed  on 
that  basis  alone.  Therefore, 
the  answer 
to 
this  question  of

"","CONCLUSION OF THE COURT"
