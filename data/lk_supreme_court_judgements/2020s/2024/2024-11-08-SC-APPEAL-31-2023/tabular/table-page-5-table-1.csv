"7.","Subsequently,  the  Appellant  had  instituted  a  fresh  case  bearing  No.  DSP  261/2014  by"
"","Petition dated 11th December 2014 in the District Court of Colombo under Section 29P"
"","of the Peopleâ€™s Bank Act as amended seeking an order for delivery of possession.  The"
"","Appellant  states  that,  at  the  time  of  filing  this  second  Petition,  the  original  of  the"
"","aforementioned  Certificate  of  Sale  has  been  misplaced  and/or  lost  subsequent  to  the"
"","withdrawal of the earlier petition."
"8.","The Respondent contends that when the Appellant Bank passed the resolution to auction"
"","the  mortgaged  property  and  attempted  to  auction  the  same,  his  mother,  late  Diasy"
"","Haththotuwa  (nee Jayawardena), instituted  action bearing No. 5712/SPL in the District"
"","Court  of  Colombo  seeking  to  prevent  the  Appellant  Bank  from  so  auctioning  the"
"","property. The District Court had subsequently issued an enjoining order on 24th August"
"","2000 preventing the Appellant from auctioning the property."
"9.","The  Respondent 
further 
states 
that 
the  Appellant 
carried  out 
this  auction 
in"
"","contravention  of  this  enjoining  order,  thus  rendering  the  auction,  as  well  as  all  other"
"","actions  pursuant  thereto,  illegal.  However,  neither  the  legality  of  the  auction  nor  the"
"","validity of the Certificate of Sale have been placed as questions before this Court."
