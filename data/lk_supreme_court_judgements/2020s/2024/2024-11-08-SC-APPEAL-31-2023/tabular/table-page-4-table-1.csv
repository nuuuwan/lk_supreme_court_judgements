"","Petition of the  Appellant. Due to the  default  of such mortgagees to settle the monies"
"","due under the said mortgage bonds, the Board of Directors of the Appellant Bank had"
"","unanimously adopted a resolution to auction the mortgaged property in order to recover"
"","the outstanding sums."
"3.","After taking steps under the People’s Bank Act, No. 32 of 1986 (hereinafter sometimes the"
"","‘Act’),  the  Bank  had  auctioned  the  property  on  27th  August  2000.  As  there  were  no"
"","bidders at the said auction the Appellant Bank itself had purchased the said property on"
"","a Certificate of Sale No. 408 dated 06th September 2000."
"4.","The position of the Appellant is that all rights, title and interest of the Respondent in the"
"","said property was thereby vested with the Appellant and that the Respondent thereafter"
"","wrongfully  and  unlawfully  failed  and  neglected  to  hand  over  vacant  and  peaceful"
"","possession of the said property to the Appellant."
"5.","On  this  basis,  the Appellant  had  instituted  a  case  against  the  Respondent  by  Petition"
"","dated 22nd October 2003 in the District Court of Colombo bearing Case No. 6881/SPL"
"","under  and  in  terms  of  the  People’s  Bank  Act,  No.  29  of  1961  as  amended  against  the"
"","Respondent and said Daisy Haththotuwa. During the pendency of this case, this Court"
"","delivered the judgment in Ramachandra v. Hatton National Bank1 which changed the"
"","paradigm which existed with respect to the parate execution of 3rd party mortgages."
"6.","The Appellant states that they withdrew the said District Court case, reserving the right"
"","to  file  a  new  application,  to  consider  the  effects  of  the  said  judgment  due  to  the"
"","uncertainty created vis-à-vis parate execution of 3rd party mortgages by the same."
