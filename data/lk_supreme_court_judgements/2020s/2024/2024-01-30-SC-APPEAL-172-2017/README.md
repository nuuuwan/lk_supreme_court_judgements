Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Ratnapura against eight

defendants to partition the land known as Labungederawatta described in the

schedule to the plaint according to the partition law. The 9th to 14th defendants

were later added. After trial, the judgment was delivered partitioning the land

among the plaintiff, the 2nd to 5th defendants, and the 7th and 9th defendants. No

party appealed against the judgment. The final partition plan was confirmed by

Court without any contest. In the final decree, the 2nd defendant was allotted lots

2, 3 and 7 of the final partition plan No. 1456 dated 16.08.2010. The instant

appeal relates to the delivery of possession of the said three lots.

According to journal entry No. 44 dated 02.04.1987, the District Judge was

informed about the death of the 2nd defendant, namely Kumbukkolawatte Dingiri

Ethana and the Court directed the plaintiff to take steps. According to journal

entry No. 46 dated 10.12.1987, steps were taken to serve order nisi on M.M.

Lamahamy and M.M. Bandulahamy who were said to be the daughter and son

of the deceased 2nd defendant, Dingiri Ethana. It is not clear from the journal

entry whether they were present in Court on that date. However, the Court

11

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

substituted Bandulahamy as the 2(a) defendant. Lamahamy has later been

added as the 14th defendant.

The judgment was delivered on 11.03.2009. In the meantime, 2(a) defendant,

Bandulahamy, has died. According to journal entry No. 145 dated 01.09.2011,

steps were tendered in open Court. The petition and affidavit dated 01.09.2011

filed by one Gamini Premadasa through an Attorney-at-Law are in the brief. No

documents were tendered with the petition and affidavit. Bandulahamys death

certificate was not tendered. Not even the date of death was disclosed. In the

affidavit, Gamini Premadasa stated that Bandulahamy was appointed as the sole

heir of the original 2nd defendant Dingiri Ethana, and that Bandulahamy

transferred his rights to Gamini Premadasa by Deed No. 679 dated 01.11.1991.

These assertions, as I will explain later, are not correct.

In the judgment delivered after trial, the District Judge clearly states at page 11

that Bandulahamy is not the only child of Dingiri Ethana, and that there is no

necessity in this case to investigate how Dingiri Ethanas rights devolve on

others. It is on that basis, in the final decree of partition, lots 2, 3 and 7 were

allotted in the 2nd defendants name.

The succeeding District Judge had not considered any of these things but had

made a perfunctory order substituting Gamini Premadasa as the 2(b) defendant

in place of the deceased 2(a) defendant Bandulahamy.

What did Bandulahamy transfer by Deed No. 679 pending partition?

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

By that Deed, Bandulahamy transferred what he might be allotted in the final

decree of partition. He did not get anything from the final decree but his deceased

mother, the 2nd defendant, was allotted lots 2, 3 and 7 of the final partition plan.

Bandulahamy did not and could not transfer the entirety of lots 2, 3 and 7 unless

he was the only heir of the 2nd defendant. It must be remembered that Deed No.

679 is not a Deed executed by the 2nd defendant Dingiri Ethana during the

pendency of the partition action but by one of her children, Bandulahamy.

After the final decree was registered, the 2(b) defendant Gamini Premadasa

tendered steps by way of a motion dated 21.03.2013 to eject the current

occupants of lots 2, 3, and 7 and deliver possession of those lots to him. This

was minuted in journal entry No. 156 dated 28.03.2013. The District Judge

allowed that application in chambers. The possession has not been delivered yet.

The heirs of the original 2nd defendant seem to be in possession of those lots.

In view of this development, Bandulahamys son, M.M. Bandusena, made an

application by way of petition and affidavit dated 07.06.2013 seeking to quash

the order appointing Gamini Premadasa as the 1(b) defendant and to suspend

the execution of the writ. This is minuted in journal entry No. 157 dated

10.06.2013.

The District Judge, by a two-page order dated 09.01.2014 dismissed this

application with costs on the following basis:

.

.

. .

.

5000/- .

13

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

The order of the learned District Judge is contradictory. Firstly, the learned

Judge says that the application cannot be maintained because proceedings

stand terminated with the entering of the final decree. He states the application

to cancel the appointment of the 2(b) defendant should have been made prior to

the entering of the final decree. According to journal entry No. 145, this

appointment was made and the final decree was entered on the same date. After

stating that there are no live proceedings, the learned Judge then states that this

frivolous application was made to delay the conclusion of the case. The learned

Judge further states that if the transfer effected by Deed No. 679 is to be

challenged, it should be done in separate proceedings. Had the learned Judge

read the application carefully, he would have realised that the petitioner

Bandusena does not challenge the Deed. Bandusena has not even mentioned

that Deed. He is challenging the appointment of Gamini Premadasa in place of

Bandulahamy because Gamini Premadasa was taking steps to eject Bandusena

and others from lots 2, 3 and 7. Bandusenas main application was not to hand

over possession of those lots to Gamini Premadasa. In the order, the learned

Judge has not mentioned a word about delivery of possession.

Being dissatisfied with this order, the petitioner Bandusena preferred an appeal

to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura. The High Court affirmed the said

order of the District Court and dismissed the appeal with costs on the basis that

the 2(a) defendant Bandulahamy was the sole heir of the deceased 2nd defendant

and that the 2(a) defendant transferred his share to the 2(b) defendant by Deed

No. 679. The High Court further stated that the 2(b) defendant is entitled to

obtain possession of lots 2, 3 and 7 of the final partition plan in terms of section

52A(1)(c) of the Partition Law. As I will explain below, all these findings are not

sustainable in fact and in law.

This Court granted leave to appeal to the petitioner on the following two

questions of law:

14

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

(a) Has the Civil Appeallate High Court erred in law in failing to conclude that

the 2(b) defendant-respondent is not entitled to obtain possession of or to

obtain a writ of execution in respect of all the lots allotted to the original

2nd defendant, and does the said error vitiate the judgment dated

11.09.2014?

(b) In any event, has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by failing to

hold that the 2(b) defendant-respondent does not become entitled to the

entirety of the original 2nd defendants interest in the corpus on Deed No.

679 dated 01.11.1991?

Alienation of rights pending partition

Deed No. 679 was executed after the lis pendens was registered. In terms of

section 66 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, voluntary alienations made after

a partition action is duly registered as a lis pendens are void.

66(1) After a partition action is duly registered as a lis pendens under the

Registration of Documents Ordinance no voluntary alienation, lease or

hypothecation of any undivided share or interest of or in the land to which

the action relates shall be made or effected until the final determination of

the action by dismissal thereof, or by the entry of a decree of partition under

section 36 or by the entry of a certificate of sale.

(2) Any voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation made or effected in

contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall be void;

Provided that any such voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation shall,

in the event of the partition action being dismissed, be deemed to be valid.

(3) Any assignment, after the institution of a partition action, of a lease or

hypothecation effected prior to the registration of such partition action as a

lis pendens shall not be affected by the provisions of subsections (1) and (2)

of this section.

15

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

The main reason for this prohibition is the potential disruption that may be

caused by alienating parts of the land at frequent intervals, making it a

challenging task to reach a finality in a partition action. (Baban v. Amarasinghe

(1878) 1 SCC 24, Annamalai Pillai v. Perera (1902) 6 NLR 108, Subaseris v. Prolis

(1913) 16 NLR 393, Hewawasan v. Gunasekere (1926) 28 NLR 33, Srinatha v.

Sirisena [1998] 3 Sri LR 19 at 23)

However, it is now well-settled law that this prohibition for alienation does not

apply to contingent interests in the land (those that might ultimately be allotted

to him in the final decree) being alienated pending partition. Section 66 only

prohibits the alienation of undivided interests presently vested in the owners.

(Louis Appuhamy v. Punchi Baba (1904) 10 NLR 196, Sillie Fernando v. Silman

Fernando (1962) 64 NLR 404, Karunaratne v. Perera (1965) 67 NLR 529,

Sirinatha v. Sirisena [1998] 3 Sri LR 19)

In the case of Kahan Bhai v. Perera (1923) 26 NLR 204 at 208, a Full Bench of

the Supreme Court presided over by Bertram C.J. with the agreement of Ennis,

Schneider, Garvin JJ., and Jayawardene A.J. held that Persons desiring to

charge or dispose of their interests in a property subject to a partition suit can only

do so by expressly charging or disposing of the interest to be ultimately allotted to

them in the action.

In Sirisoma v. Sarnelis Appuhamy (1950) 51 NLR 337 at 341, a Divisional Bench

of the Supreme Court presided over by Gratiaen J. with the agreement of Dias

S.P.J. and Pulle J., having considered almost all the previous decisions including

Kahan Bhai v. Perera, took the view that the prohibition against alienation

pending partition need not be interpreted overly broadly.

Section 17 of the Partition Ordinance prohibits the alienation or

hypothecation of undivided interests presently vested in the owners of a

land which is the subject of pending partition proceedings. There is no

statutory prohibition against a persons common law right to alienate or

16

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

hypothecate, by anticipation, interests which he can only acquire upon the

conclusion of the proceedings. That right is in no way affected by the

pendency of an action for partition under the provisions of the Ordinance.

Section 17 imposes a fetter on the free alienation of property, and the Court

ought to see that that fetter is not made more comprehensive than the

language and the intention of the section require. Subaseris v. Prolis (1913)

16 NLR 393

Nevertheless, the grantee of such contingent interest need not be made a party

to the case as he has no absolute interest other than contingent interest vested

in him pending partition. Interest would only vest in him upon the entering of

the final decree provided the grantor is allotted a lot in severalty. (Nazeer v.

Hassim (1947) 48 NLR 282, Karunaratne v. Perera (1965) 67 NLR 529, Abeyratne

v. Rosalin [2001] 3 Sri LR 308)

If such contingent interests are alienated pending partition without any

conditions, immediately on the final decree being entered, the lot in severalty

allotted to the grantor will automatically pass and vest in the grantee without

execution of another Deed, although, in practice, another Deed is also executed

for better manifestation of the intention of the grantor.

In Sirisoma v. Sarnelis Appuhamy (1950) 51 NLR 337 Gratiaen J. stated at 343:

[W]hen an instrument has been executed whereby a present right is

conveyed in respect of a contingent interest which the parties to the

transaction expect to be realised at some future date, the instrument already

executed operates so as to vest that interest in the purchaser as soon as it

has been acquired by the vendor. No further conveyance is needed to secure

the intended result although it may well be desirable, as is often stipulated

by prudent conveyancers, that the result already achieved should be

confirmed in a further notarial instrument which will place the purchasers

rights beyond the possibility of controversy.

17

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

In Sillie Fernando v. Silman Fernando (1962) 64 NLR 404, the 2nd defendant

claimed certain soil rights, plantations and a thatched house in the land to be

partitioned. Prior to the entering of the interlocutory decree, he, by a deed of gift,

donated to his natural children born to his mistress, the 41st defendant-

appellant, the soil, plantations and the thatched house which would be allotted

to him ultimately by the final decree. The 2nd defendant died before the entering

of the final decree and his wife and legitimate child, namely, 39th and 40th

defendants, were respectively substituted in place of him. In the final decree the

soil shares of the 2nd defendant, the plantations and the thatched house as a lot

in severalty, were allotted to the substituted defendants, and they moved for a

writ of possession against the 41st defendant and her children who were in

possession. This was allowed by the District Judge. On appeal, the Supreme

Court set aside that order and stated at 404-405:

It has been held by this Court in Sirisoma v. Sarnelis Appuhamy (1950) 51

NLR 337 and by a fuller Bench at a later stage, that, when a deed purports

to sell or donate an undivided interest in a land, whatever will be allotted to

the vendor or donor by a final decree in a partition action, the lot in severalty

allotted to the vendor or donor or those representing him will automatically

pass and vest in the vendee or donee under the deed in question, without

any further conveyance, either by the vendor or donor or by his

representatives.

In view of this position, the moment a final decree was entered in this case

allocating the thatched house, plantations and the lot in severalty to the

representatives of the 2nd defendant in consequence of the terms of the deed

Z1, title to that lot in severalty vested under the donees in Z1, namely, a life

interest or usufruct in favour of the 41st defendant-appellant and title or

donarium in her children.

18

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

Substitution in partition actions

Substitution in partition actions is different from that in other civil actions. In

partition actions involving multiple parties and prolonged proceedings, the death

of a party might go unnoticed. A classic example might be the instant case, filed

in the District Court more than 46 years ago, on 11.11.1977. In a partition

action, all parties are not active; most of them remain dormant. Nevertheless,

the District Judge in a partition action cannot afford to remain dormant. He must

play an active role throughout the proceedings. Although the system of justice

we adopt is adversarial as opposed to inquisitorial, the Judge in a partition action

assumes an inquisitorial role. This distinction arises from partition actions being

actions in rem, where the resulting decree binds the entire world.

It was the position in early cases that the death of a party without being

substituted would render the entire proceedings a nullity from the point of the

death of such party, despite the decree having been entered after a contested

trial. (Somapala v. Sirimanne (1954) 51 CLW 31 per Gratiaen J., Suraweera v.

Jayasena (1971) 76 NLR 413 per H.N.G. Fernando C.J.)

It was held by Sansoni C.J. with the agreement of T.S. Fernando, Sri Skanda

Rajah and G.P.A. Silva JJ. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed (1965) 68 NLR

36 at 38-39:

[I]t is clear that a partition decree which allotted a share to a party, but

which was entered after the death of that party, is a nullity. It is open to

another party to the action to ask this Court in revision to set aside that

decree (even though it may have been affirmed in appeal) and to remit the

case to the lower Court in order that proper steps may be taken in the action-

see Chelliah v. Tamber (1904) 5 Tamb. Rep. 52; Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera (1950) 52 NLR 409; Somapala v. Sirimanne (1954) 51 CLW 31.

19

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

Having realised the serious injustice caused to the parties thereby, when the

present Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, was enacted, the following section was

introduced.

48(6). Where by an interlocutory or final decree a right, share or interest has

been awarded to a party but such party was dead at the time, such decree

shall be deemed to be a decree in favour of the representatives in interest of

such deceased person at the date of such decree.

Thereafter, the legislature introduced special provisions to simplify the

substitution procedure in partition actions by repealing and replacing section 81

of the Partition Law by the Partition (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 1997.

Section 81(1) necessitates every party to a partition action or any other person

required to file a memorandum under the Partition Law, to file such

memorandum, substantially in the form set out in the second schedule to the

Partition Law, nominating at least one person, and not more than three persons,

in order of preference, to be his legal representative for the purposes of the action

in the event of his death pending the final determination of the action.

According to section 81(5), such party or person may file a fresh memorandum

at any time before the final determination of the action.

Section 81(2)(c) enacts that the person or persons so nominated shall subscribe

his or their signatures to the memorandum signifying consent to be so appointed

as a legal representative. The signatures of the nominator and those of the

nominee or nominees so consenting to be appointed shall be witnessed by an

Attorney-at-Law or a Justice of the Peace or a Commissioner of Oaths.

Section 4(2) of the Partition Law mandates every plaintiff to file a memorandum

nominating legal representatives.

4(2). There shall be appended to every plaint presented to a court for the

purpose of instituting a partition action, a memorandum substantially in the

20

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

form set out in the Second Schedule to this Law, nominating in accordance

with section 81, a person to be the legal representative of the plaintiff for the

purposes of the action, in the event of his death pending the final

determination of the action.

Section 19(d) mandates every defendant to do so.

19(d). Every defendant in the action shall file or cause to be filed, in court, a

memorandum, substantially in the form set out in the Second Schedule to

this Law, nominating in accordance with section 81, a person to be his legal

representative for the purposes of the action, in the event of his death

pending the final determination of the action.

According to section 69(1), any person who applies to be added as a party, any

purchaser who is substituted under section 69(2), and any intervenient as

described under section 69(3), shall also file such memorandum.

However, it should be borne in mind that the failure to file a memorandum shall

not affect the substantive rights of the party or person. The proviso to section

81(2)(c) reads as follows:

Provided however, that failure to file such memorandum shall not by such

failure alone render the plaint, statement of claim, or application to be added

as a party defective or, notwithstanding anything in section 7, be a cause

or ground for rejecting such plaint, statement of claim or any application to

be added as a party.

This is emphasised in section 81(9) as well. It states that the failure to file a

memorandum shall not invalidate the proceedings in the action.

Notwithstanding that a party or person has failed to file a memorandum

under the provisions of this section, and that there has been no appointment

of a legal representative to represent the estate of such deceased party or

person, any judgment or decree entered in the action or any order made,

21

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

partition or sale effected or thing done in the action shall be deemed to be

valid and effective and in conformity with the provisions of this Law and

shall bind the legal heirs and representatives of such deceased party or

person. Such failure to file a memorandum shall also not be a ground for

invalidating the proceedings in such action.

Under section 81(3), the Court may, at any time before the final determination

of the action, direct a party or any person required to file a memorandum to do

so by a specified date.

A nominee may, in terms of section 81(4), at any time prior to the death of the

nominator, apply to Court by way of motion with notice to the nominator to

withdraw his consent as the nominee.

After the death of the nominator, section 81(8) permits the nominee to apply for

permission from Court to be released from the office of legal representative of

such nominator. If such nominee is the only nominee, the Court can appoint a

consenting heir of such deceased nominator to that position.

Section 81(10)(a) empowers any party or person to apply to Court for the

appointment of a legal representative in the event of a death of a party or person

who had failed to file a memorandum as required by section 81. Gamini

Premadasa seems to have made the application dated 01.09.2011 under this

section.

81(10)(a). On the death of a party or person who had failed to file a

memorandum as required by this section, any party or person may apply to

court by an ex parte application, requesting that a person be appointed as

the legal representative of such deceased party or person and the court may,

on being satisfied after inquiry that such appointment is necessary, appoint

a suitable person to be the legal representative of such deceased party or

person for the purposes of the action. Such legal representative shall be

bound by the proceedings had up to the time of such appointment.

22

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

According to section 81(10)(a) the Court may make such appointment on being

satisfied after inquiry that such appointment is necessary. However, in the

instant case, no such inquiry has been held.

Section 81(11) permits an heir of the deceased nominator to apply to Court for

the removal of the nominator and the appointment of another individual as the

legal representative of the deceased.

81(11)(a). An heir of a deceased nominator may, at any time after the death

of such nominator, apply to court to have the legal representative of such

deceased nominator removed and to have another person named in such

application or the person next named in order of preference in the

memorandum filed by the deceased nominator, appointed as such legal

representative. The person who for the time being is the legal representative

of the deceased nominator shall be made a respondent to such application.

(b) The court may, upon being satisfied that it is in the interests of the heirs

of the deceased nominator to do so, remove such legal representative and

appoint the person next named in order of preference in the memorandum

filed by the deceased nominator or if there are sufficient grounds for doing

so, appoint the person named in the application, as the legal representative

of the deceased nominator.

(c) An application under this section shall be by way of petition and affidavit

and the court may in its discretion, issue notice of the application to the other

heirs, if any, of the deceased nominator.

The appellant seems to have made the application in terms of section 81(11).

It may be noted that such nominees who are designated as legal representatives

of the nominator need not necessarily be the heirs of the nominator. They can

be anybody who can take steps for the purpose of the action as the deceased

nominator would have been entitled to take had he been alive.

23

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

The appointment of a legal representative does not affect the rights of the heirs

of the deceased. He only represents the estate of the deceased for the purpose of

the action. With the death of the deceased, the legal representative does not

become the owner of all the properties of the deceased.

The devolution of title needs to be decided separately. What section 81(1) requires

is for the party or any other person to file a memorandum nominating persons

to be his legal representative for the purpose of the action. The term for the

purpose of the action is stressed throughout section 81.

Section 81(14) reads as follows:

For the purposes of this section legal representative means, a person who

represents the estate of a deceased party or person, for the purposes of the

action, by virtue of a nomination, or of an appointment by court under this

section.

With reference to section 81(14) of the Partition Act, Amarasekara J. in

Premawathie v. Thilakaratne [2021] 3 Sri LR 382 at 392 states:

As per section 81(14) of the Partition Act, a legal representative means a

person who represents the estate of the deceased person. Generally, in a

partition action shares are given or rights are granted to the original party

and if the party is dead, the legal representative gets it not for him/her but

on behalf of all the heirs of the deceased or for the person/s entitled under

the original deceased party.

There is no requirement for the legal representative to file a memorandum

nominating his legal representatives in the event of his death. Upon the death of

the legal representative, the next in order of preference in the memorandum of

the original party will assume the role. If the sole legal representative dies, a legal

representative needs to be appointed, not for the deceased legal representative,

but for the original party deceased.

24

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

Applicability of section 81 to the issue in the instant appeal

The learned District Judge misunderstood the issue. He neither referred to

section 81 nor to the delivery of possession of lots.

The High Court referred to section 81(10) and stated that These sections are

applicable only in the instances where the case is pending and before the final

determination for the purpose of the action. The High Court concluded that the

appellant does not meet these qualifications. I am unable to agree.

The application of Gamini Premadasa dated 01.09.2011 fell under section

81(10)(a), while the application of the appellant dated 07.06.2013 fell under

section 81(11).

The High Court took the view that the action had been finally determined and

that there is nothing to be done for the purpose of the action.

Section 81(10)(a) requires the Court to appoint a person to be the legal

representative for the purpose of the action. Gamini Premadasa made the

application to appoint him as the legal representative not of the original 2nd

defendant but of the legal representative of the 2nd defendant, Bandulahamy, on

the same date the final decree was confirmed. This application was made seeking

an order from Court to deliver possession of lots 2, 3 and 7 of the final plan to

him on the basis that he is the owner of those lots by Deed No. 679. This was

allowed by Court. I have already commented on Deed No. 679. Even if it is a valid

Deed, Gamini Premadasa does not become entitled to the entirety of lots 2, 3 and

7 by virtue of that Deed as Bandulahamy is not the only heir but one of the heirs

of the original 2nd defendant, Dingiri Ethana. The delivery of possession of lots

2, 3 and 7 will result in ejecting the 2nd defendants heirs and Bandulahamys

heirs from possession of the said lots. Is not the application of the appellant for

the purpose of the action? The High Court states that It appears that the

appellant, very well knowingly that he has no locus standi as his mother, the 2A

defendant, has already transferred the share to be allocated, subject to the

25

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

pending partition, has made this vague application in order to delay the application

made by the respondent [Gamini Premadasa] for the writ of possession. The High

Court has misdirected itself on the facts. It was not the mother (the 2nd

defendant) who transferred contingent interests, but her legal representative

Bandulahamy who transferred his (Bandulahamys) contingent interests. The

High Court ought to have considered the application of the appellant on the

merits and made an appropriate order.

The High Court also misdirected itself on the facts when it stated It was revealed

in the evidence that the 2A defendant [Bandulahamy] was the only heir of the

deceased 2nd defendant, and therefore he shall have all the rights to alienate

entitlement of the land, subject to the partition action as there were no other heirs

to be substituted. As I stated previously, the District Judge in his judgment

clearly came to the finding that Bandulahamy is not the only heir of the 2nd

defendant and that the question of devolution of the 2nd defendants rights need

not be decided in this case. The District Judge allocated lots 2, 3 and 7 in the

name of the original 2nd defendant, Dingiri Ethana, not in the name of

Bandulahamy. Bandulahamy did not appeal against these findings of the District

Judge.

Delivery of possession in partition actions

The High Court states that the respondent [Gamini Premadasa] as a person who

derived title of the 2nd defendant in accordance with section 52A(1)(c), has made

an application to obtain possession in the same case, and therefore that

application should be allowed.

The delivery of possession in partition actions is different from the delivery of

possession in any other civil action. Sections 52, 52A, 77 and 79 of the Partition

Law are the sections relevant to the delivery of possession. Section 52A was

introduced by the same Amendment Act, No. 17 of 1997, which introduced

section 81, discussed earlier.

26

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

Section 52(1)

According to section 52(1), a successful party or a purchaser, for whom a

certificate of sale has been issued by Court, is entitled to make an application in

the same action, by motion, for an order for the delivery of possession of the land

or a portion thereof as per the final decree of partition. The proviso to this section

stipulates that this entitlement is contingent upon payment of any owelty or

compensation for improvements, if applicable.

52(1). Every party to a partition action who has been declared to be entitled

to any land by any final decree entered under this Law and every person

who has purchased any land at any sale held under this Law and in whose

favour a certificate of sale in respect of the land so purchased has been

entered by the court, shall be entitled to obtain from the court, in the same

action, on application made by motion in that behalf, an order for the

delivery to him of possession of the land:

Provided that where such party is liable to pay any amount as owelty or as

compensation for improvements, he shall not be entitled to obtain such order

until that amount is paid.

In view of section 81(7), every party and every person referred to in section 52

includes his legal representatives in the event of the death of such party or

person.

81(7). A nominee deemed to be the legal representative of a deceased

nominator shall be entitled to take all such steps for the purposes of the

action as the deceased nominator would have been entitled to take had he

been alive.

Section 52(1) does not expressly state the time period within which an

application for delivery of possession can be made to Court. This is an omission

27

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

on the part of the legislature. However, this omission can be addressed through

sections 77 and 79.

Section 77 enacts that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code relating to the

execution or service of writs, warrants and other processes of Court shall apply

in relation to the execution or service of writs, warrants and other processes of

Court in a partition action.

Section 79 enacts that in any matter or question of procedure not provided for

in the Partition Law, the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code in a

like matter or question shall be followed by the Court, if such procedure is not

inconsistent with the provisions of the Partition Law.

In cases such as Samarakoon v. Punchi Banda (1975) 78 NLR 525, Abeyratne v.

Manchanayake [1992] 1 Sri LR 361, Munidasa v. Nandasena [2001] 2 Sri LR

224, it was held that section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code, which states that

(subject to some exceptions) an application to execute a decree shall be made

within 10 years from the date of the decree or on appeal affirming the same, is

inapplicable to partition decrees.

In Abeyratne v. Manchanayake the Court held that if the 10-year period

stipulated in section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code is applicable, such period

shall commence from the date the owelty or compensation was paid.

If section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable or applicable only from

the date the owelty or compensation is paid, an allottee in a partition action

could delay execution of the writ for an indefinite period. This delay might allow

him to seek ejectment of those in possession, possibly even several decades after

the final decree was entered. This cannot be the intention of the legislature. By

the time the allotee makes the application for delivery of possession, those lots

may have been prescribed by others.

28

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

Although Samarakoon v. Punchi Banda is cited to argue against the applicability

of the 10-year period stipulated in section 337 to partition actions, a closer

scrutiny of the judgment reveals that the Supreme Court appreciates the

necessity of filing the application for writ within 10 years. The Court states at

pages 527-528 that if the fiscal is resisted during execution, he will report it to

the Court, triggering the procedure outlined in section 53 (regarding contempt of

Court). In these proceedings under section 53, the resisting party can

demonstrate to the Court that his resistance did not constitute contempt by

presenting a defence, such as having acquired prescriptive title to the land after

the final decree was entered. Let me quote what the Supreme Court stated at

pages 527-528 of the judgment:

The correct procedure that should be adopted in giving possession of a

divided lot to a party who had been declared entitled to it under a final

partition decree is set out in Section 52 of the Partition Act.

A party requiring possession must apply by way of a motion in the same

action for an order for the delivery of possession of the lot. The Court

thereafter on being satisfied that the person applying is entitled to the order

will issue an order to the Fiscal to put the party in possession of the lot. The

Fiscal on receiving the order, will repair to the land and deliver possession

of the lot to the party.

If the Fiscal is resisted, he will report the resistance to Court and the

procedure set out in Section 53 of the Partition Act will apply.

In the proceedings under Section 53, it will be open to the party resisting, to

satisfy the Court, that his resistance did not constitute a Contempt of the

Court. This he could do, for example by showing that he had prescribed to

the said lot after the final decree had been entered, and the party applying

for an order of possession under Section 52, had no right to be given

possession of the land.

29

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

This illustrates that if the application under section 52 is to succeed, a party to

the action or a purchaser at sale must make the application to Court within the

10-year period.

This is further understood by a closer reading of section 52A, which was

introduced by Partition (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 1997. In short, in terms of

section 52A, a party who has been dispossessed or whose possession has been

interfered with can make an application for restoration of possession in the same

action within 10 years of the date of the final decree of partition. If the application

for restoration of possession must be made within 10 years of the date of the

final decree of partition, it is illogical to assume that an application for delivery

of possession can be made beyond the period of 10 years. If delivery of possession

has not taken place, restoration of possession does not arise.

I hold that in terms of section 52 of the Partition Law read with section 337 of

the Civil Procedure Code, an application for delivery of possession in a partition

action shall be made within ten years of the date of the final decree of partition

or the issuance of the certificate of sale or on appeal affirming the same.

Eviction of a tenant

The law relating to eviction of a tenant under the partition law suffers from a

lack of clarity and is therefore complicated.

According to section 48(1) of the Partition Law, the right, share or interest

awarded in the interlocutory and final decree of partition is free from all

encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in the decree.

Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory decree

entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered under

section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may be

preferred therefrom, and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject also

to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good and sufficient

30

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest awarded

therein to him and be final and conclusive for all purposes against all

persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to

have, to or in the land to which such decree relates and notwithstanding

any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced before

the court or the fact that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition

action; and the right, share or interest awarded by any such decree shall be

free from all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in that

decree.

The term encumbrance is defined in section 48(1).

In this subsection and in the next subsection encumbrance means any

mortgage, lease, usufruct, servitude, life interest, trust, or any interest

whatsoever howsoever arising except a constructive or charitable trust, a

lease at will or for a period not exceeding one month.

Although section 48(1) states that this definition is applicable to both subsection

(1) and (2) of section 48, section 48(2) makes a difference.

Section 48(2) reads as follows:

Where in pursuance of the interlocutory decree a land or any lot thereof is

sold, the certificate of sale entered in favour of the purchaser shall be

conclusive evidence of the purchasers title to the land or lot as at the date

of the confirmation of sale, free from all encumbrances whatsoever except

any servitude which is expressly specified in such interlocutory decree and

a lease at will or for a period not exceeding one month.

After the trial, the District Court may order partition of the land or sale of the

land in whole or in lots. While section 48(1) relates to partition of land, section

48(2) relates to sale of the land.

31

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

When it comes to encumbrances, Partition Act, No. 16 of 1951, did not have a

provision similar to section 48(2) in the present Partition Law. Hence there was

a difference of opinion as to whether a purchaser at sale upon receipt of the

certificate of sale acquires the full title without any encumbrances unlike a party

who has been declared entitled to a lot or lots in the final partition plan. Vide

Heenatigala v. Bird (1954) 55 NLR 277, Britto v. Heenatigala (1956) 57 NLR 327,

Ranasinghe v. Marikar (1970) 73 NLR 361.

Section 52(2) of the Partition Law now in force addresses the issue of eviction of

a tenant in the execution of the final decree of partition or a purchaser at a sale

held under the Partition Law.

In terms of section 52(2)(a), an allottee of a final decree of partition or a purchaser

at a sale held under the Partition Law, can make an application by petition to

which such person in occupation shall be made respondent for delivery of

possession seeking eviction of anyone in the land or a house in the land.

Where the applicant for delivery of possession seeks to evict any person in

occupation of a land or a house standing on the land as tenant for a period

not exceeding one month who is liable to be evicted by the applicant, such

application shall be made by petition to which such person in occupation

shall be made respondent, setting out the material facts entitling the

applicant to such order.

The nature of the inquiry and the order to be made are stated in section 52(2)(b):

After hearing the respondent, if the court shall determine that the

respondent having entered into occupation prior to the date of such final

decree or certificate of sale, is entitled to continue in occupation of the said

house as tenant under the applicant as landlord, the court shall dismiss the

application; otherwise it shall grant the application and direct that an order

for delivery of possession of the said house and land to the applicant do

issue.

32

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

At the inquiry, two conditions must be satisfied by the respondent who claims

tenancy:

(a) that he came into occupation prior to the date of the final decree or

certificate of sale, and

(b) that he is entitled to continue in occupation of the said house as tenant

under the applicant as the landlord.

Under (b) above, the person claiming tenancy shall prove that the allottee of the

lot on which the premises stand in terms of the final decree is his landlord. If the

lot on which the premises stand is allotted to another, the tenant cannot claim

tenancy under the new owner.

In Martin Singho v. Nanda Peiris [1995] 2 Sri LR 221, the District Court allowed

the 1st respondents application for delivery of possession of lot 1 by ejecting the

petitioners who claimed tenancy rights. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held at

223:

Section 52(2) read with section 48(1) of the Partition Law and section 14(1)

of the Rent Act, required court to determine (1) whether the petitioners had

entered into occupation of the premises as tenants prior to the date of the

final decree and (2) whether they were entitled to continue in occupation of

the premises as tenants under the original 1st respondent Rosalin Fonseka,

who was allotted the lot in which the relevant houses stood. If the petitioners

succeeded in satisfying court of the two matters aforesaid, the application

of the 1st respondent had to be dismissed, as section 14(1) of the Rent Act

makes provision for the tenants of residential premises to continue as such,

under any co-owner who has been allotted the relevant premises in the final

decree.

The petitioners failed to prove what was required from them by law. Hence the

Court of Appeal dismissed the application of the petitioners remarking at page

224:

33

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

As observed by the District Judge, the petitioners have failed to produce any

documentary evidence in proof of their tenancy. The best test of establishing

tenancy is proof of payment of rent, and the best evidence of payment of

rent is rent receipts. (see Jayawardene v. Wanigasekera [1985] 1 Sri LR

125) We see no reason to interfere with the order of the District Judge.

In Ramasinghe v. Hettihewa [1998] BLR 34 at 35, the Court of Appeal held:

It is to be noted that a co-owner is entitled to let his undivided shares of the

common property. Similarly a co-owner has a right to compel a division of

the common property. Where property could not be divided without injury or

if partition was impossible or inexpedient the law permits a sale of it among

the co-owners for preference. As tenants rights are derived from and

dependent on the title of the person from whom he gets his tenancy, the

rights of a tenant under one co-owner are subject to the prior rights of the

other co-owners to compel a division of the property by partition or sale.

Where there is a partition, his rights will be restricted to the divided portion

obtained by the co-owner who gave him tenancy.

In the instant case the learned trial Judge after due inquiry found that the

petitioner was not a tenant of the 1st respondent who was allotted lot 4 in

the final decree. I reject the proposition that the new owner of the lot in which

there is a house with a tenant is the landlord, by operation of law.

Ranasinghe v. Marikar (supra) was a five judge bench decision made under the

repealed Rent Restriction Act on the question of delivery of possession after a

sale of the premises under the repealed Partition Act, No. 16 of 1951. It was held

in that case:

Where there is a valid letting of the entirety of premises to which the Rent

Restriction Act applies, a sale of the premises under the Partition Act does

not extinguish the rights of the tenant as against the purchaser, even if the

tenants interest is not expressly specified in the interlocutory decree

34

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

entered in the partition action. Section 13 of the Rent Restriction Act protects

any tenant of rent-controlled premises notwithstanding anything in any

other law except upon grounds permitted by the Section.

But if rent-controlled promises are owned by co-owners and one of them lets

the entirety of the premises without the consent or acquiescence of the other

co-owners, the protection of the Rent Restriction Act is not available to the

tenant as against a purchaser who buys the premises subsequently in terms

of an interlocutory decree for sale entered under the Partition Act. In such a

case, the tenant cannot resist an application by the purchaser to be placed

in possession of the premises.

In the case of Thambirajah v. Abdul Kudoos Dorai [1990] 2 Sri LR 319, the

premises were situated within the municipal limits of Colombo and hence were

governed by the Rent Act, No. 7 of 1972. Both the District Court and the Court

of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to an order for delivery of possession

in terms of section 52(2)(b) of the Partition Law as the evidence was insufficient

to establish a valid tenancy.

If a valid tenancy is established in respect of premises governed by the Rent Act,

section 14(1) of the Rent Act becomes applicable. It states notwithstanding

anything in any other law, the tenant of any residential premises which is

purchased by any person under the Partition Law or which is allocated to a co-

owner under a decree for partition shall be deemed to be the tenant of such

purchaser or of such co-owner.

Section 14(1) of the Rent Act reads as follows:

Notwithstanding anything in any other law, the tenant of any residential

premises which is purchased by any person under the Partition Law or

which is allocated to a co-owner under a decree for partition shall be deemed

to be the tenant of such purchaser or of such co-owner, as the case may be,

and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly, and where such

35

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

tenant is deprived of any amenities as a result of such partition, the owner

of the premises where such amenities are located shall permit such tenant

to utilize such amenities without making any payment therefor until such

amenities are provided by such purchaser or co-owner or by the tenant

under subsection (3).

Although this section is in conflict with section 52(2)(b) of the Partition Law

which specifies that the person claiming tenancy shall prove that he is entitled

to continue in occupation of the said house as tenant under the applicant as

landlord, section 14(1) of the Rent Act overrides section 52(2)(b) due to the term

notwithstanding anything in any other law used in that section. Accordingly,

the protection given to tenants by the Rent Act is not extinguished by a partition

or sale of land under the Partition Law whether or not the allottee or purchaser

at sale is the landlord of the tenant.

In Esabella Perera Hamine v. Emalia Perera Hamine [1990] 1 Sri LR 8, the Court

of Appeal affirmed the order of restoration of such a tenant to possession by the

District Court when it was found that the tenant had been evicted without

following the procedure stipulated in section 52(2). The Court of Appeal held that

such restoration can be done by invocation of the inherent powers of the Court.

In Virasinghe v. Virasinghe [2002] 1 Sri LR 264, the Supreme Court held that it

is not permissible to enter a finding in a judgment, interlocutory decree or final

decree in a partition action with regard to any claim of a monthly tenant in

respect of the land sought to be partitioned. Such questions should, if at all, be

considered at the stage of execution in terms of section 52 of the Law.

Restoration of possession

Section 52A deals with restoration of possession.

52A(1). Any person

36

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

(a) who has been declared entitled to any land by any final decree

entered under this Law; or

(b) who has purchased any land at any sale held under this Law and in

whose favour a certificate of sale in respect of the land so purchased

has been entered by Court; or

(c) who has derived title from a person referred to in paragraph (a), or

paragraph (b),

and whose possession has been, or is interfered with or who has been

dispossessed, shall, if such interference or dispossession occurs within ten

years of the date of the final decree of partition or the entering of the

certificate of sale, as the case may be, be entitled to make application, in the

same action, by way of petition for restoration of possession, within twelve

months of the date of such interference or dispossession, as the case may

be.

(2) The person against whom the application for restoration of possession is

made, shall be made the respondent to the application.

(3) The Court shall, after due inquiry into the matter, make order for delivery

of possession or otherwise as the justice of the case may require:

Provided that, no order for delivery of possession of the land shall be made

where the respondent is a person who derives his title to the land in dispute

or part thereof directly from the final decree of partition or sale, or is a person

who has acquired title to such land from a person who has derived title to

such land under the final decree of partition or sale, or from the privies or

heirs of such second mentioned person.

In the instant appeal, the High Court took the view that the 2(b) defendant

Gamini Premadasa has made the application to obtain possession in accordance

with section 52A(1)(c).

37

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

In terms of section 52A, if the possession of a party or a purchaser or a person

who has derived title from such party or purchaser has been or is interfered with

or has been dispossessed, if such interference or dispossession occurs within 10

years of the date of the final decree of partition or entering of the certificate of

sale, such person shall be entitled to make an application in the same action by

way of petition naming as the respondent the person against whom the

application is made, within 12 months of the date of such interference or

dispossession for restoration of possession. The Court shall, after inquiry, make

an order restoring the petitioner to possession or refusing it.

It may be noted that section 52A deals with restoration of possession, not

delivery of possession. The 2(b) defendant cannot be restored to possession

unless he was previously in possession. Section 52A cannot be invoked to deliver

possession for the first time. The delivery of possession for the first time is done

in terms of section 52.

The High Court was not correct to have concluded that the 2(a) defendant had

successfully made an application to recover possession in terms of section

52A(1)(c).

Conclusion

The two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted are answered in

the affirmative.

The order of the District Court dated 09.01.2014 and the judgment of the High

Court dated 11.09.2014 are set aside.

According to the final decree of partition, lots 2, 3 and 7 of the final partition

plan No. 1456 dated 16.08.2010 have been allotted to the original 2nd defendant,

Kumbukkolawatte Dingiri Ethana. How Dingiri Ethanas rights in respect of the

said lots should devolve shall be resolved in a separate action.

38

SC/APPEAL/172/2017

The 2(a) defendant, Gamini Premadasa, cannot seek delivery of possession in

respect of these three lots in the instant action.

The appeal is accordingly allowed.

Parties will bear their own costs.
