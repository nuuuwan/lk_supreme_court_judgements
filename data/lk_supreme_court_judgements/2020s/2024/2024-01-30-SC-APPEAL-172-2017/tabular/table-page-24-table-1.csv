"Applicability of section 81 to the issue in the instant appeal"
"The  learned  District  Judge  misunderstood  the  issue.  He  neither  referred  to"
"section 81 nor to the delivery of possession of lots."
"The  High  Court  referred  to  section  81(10)  and  stated  that  “These  sections  are"
"applicable only in the instances where the case is pending  and before the final"
"determination for the purpose of the action”. The High Court concluded that the"
"appellant does not meet these qualifications. I am unable to agree."
"The  application  of  Gamini  Premadasa  dated  01.09.2011  fell  under  section"
"81(10)(a),  while  the  application  of  the  appellant  dated  07.06.2013  fell  under"
"section 81(11)."
"The High Court took the view that the action had been finally determined and"
"that there is nothing to be done “for the purpose of the action”."
"Section  81(10)(a)  requires  the  Court  to  appoint  a  person  to  be  the

"the same date the final decree was confirmed. This application was made seeking"
"an order from Court to deliver possession of lots 2, 3 and 7 of the final plan to"
"him on the basis that he is the owner of those lots by Deed No. 679. This was"
"allowed by Court. I have already commented on Deed No. 679. Even if it is a valid"
"Deed, Gamini Premadasa does not become entitled to the entirety of lots 2, 3 and"
"7 by virtue of that Deed as Bandulahamy is not the only heir but one of the heirs"
"of the original 2nd defendant, Dingiri Ethana. The delivery of possession of lots"
"2, 3 and 7 will result in ejecting the 2nd defendant’s heirs and Bandulahamy’s"
"heirs from possession of the said lots. Is not the application of the appellant “for"
"the  purpose  of  the  action”?  The  High  Court  states  that  “It  appears  that  the"
"appellant, very well knowingly that he has no locus standi as his mother, the 2A"
"defendant,  has  already  transferred  the  share  to  be  allocated,  subject  to  the"
