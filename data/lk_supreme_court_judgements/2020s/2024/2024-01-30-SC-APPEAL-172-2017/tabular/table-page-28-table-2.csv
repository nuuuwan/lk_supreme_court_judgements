"the final decree was entered. Let me quote what the Supreme Court stated at"
"pages 527-528 of the judgment:"
"The  correct  procedure  that  should  be  adopted  in  giving  possession  of  a"
"divided  lot  to  a  party  who  had  been  declared  entitled  to  it  under  a  final"
"partition decree is set out in Section 52 of the Partition Act."
"A party requiring possession must apply by way of a motion in the same"
"action  for  an  order  for  the  delivery  of  possession  of  the  lot.  The  Court"
"thereafter on being satisfied that the person applying is entitled to the order"
"will issue an order to the Fiscal to put the party in possession of the lot. The"
"Fiscal on receiving the order, will repair to the land and deliver possession"
"of the lot to the party."
"If  the  Fiscal  is  resisted,  he  will  report  the  resistance  to  Court  and  the"
"procedure set out in Section 53 of the Partition Act will apply."
"In the proceedings under Section 53, it will be open to the party resisting, to"
"satisfy the Court, that his resistance did not constitute a Contempt of the"
"Court. This he could do, for example by showing that he had prescribed to"
"the said lot after the final decree had been entered, and the party applying"
"for  an  order  of  possession  under  Section  52,  had  no  right  to  be  given"
"possession of the land."
