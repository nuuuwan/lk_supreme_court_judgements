"25 
 SC/APPEAL/172/2017"
"pending partition, has made this vague application in order to delay the application"
"made by the respondent [Gamini Premadasa] for the writ of possession.” The High"
"Court  has  misdirected 
itself  on  the 
facts.  It  was  not  the  mother 
(the  2nd"
"defendant)  who  transferred  contingent  interests,  but  her  legal  representative"
"Bandulahamy  who  transferred  his  (Bandulahamy’s)  contingent  interests.  The"
"High  Court  ought  to  have  considered  the  application  of  the  appellant  on  the"
"merits and made an appropriate order."
"The High Court also misdirected itself on the facts when it stated “It was revealed"
"in  the  evidence  that  the  2A  defendant  [Bandulahamy]  was  the  only  heir  of  the"
"deceased  2nd  defendant,  and  therefore  he  shall  have  all  the  rights  to  alienate"
"entitlement of the land, subject to the partition action as there were no other heirs"
"to  be  substituted.”  As  I  stated  previously,  the  District  Judge  in  his  judgment"
"clearly  came  to  the  finding  that  Bandulahamy  is  not  the  only  heir  of  the  2nd"
"defendant and that the question of devolution of the 2nd defendant’s rights need"
"not be decided in this case. The District Judge allocated lots 2, 3 and 7 in the"
"name  of 
the  original  2nd  defendant,  Dingiri  Ethana,  not 
in 
the  name  of"
"Bandulahamy. Bandulahamy did not appeal against these findings of the District"
"Judge."
"Delivery of possession in partition actions"
"The High Court states that “the respondent [Gamini Premadasa] as a person who"
"derived title of the 2nd defendant in accordance with section 52A(1)(c), has made"
"an  application 
to  obtain  possession 
in 
the  same  case”,  and  therefore  that"
"application should be allowed."
"The  delivery  of  possession  in  partition  actions  is  different  from  the  delivery  of"
"possession in any other civil action. Sections 52, 52A, 77 and 79 of the Partition"
"Law  are  the  sections  relevant  to  the  delivery  of  possession.  Section  52A  was"
"introduced  by  the  same  Amendment  Act,  No.  17  of  1997,  which  introduced"
"section 81, discussed earlier."
