"","jurisdiction  until  an  arbitration  award  has  been  made.  An  arbitration"
"","followed  by  an  award 
is  a  condition  precedent  to  an  action  being"
"","instituted. But today under the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995, there is no"
"","bar to an action on the contract unless an objection is taken based on an"
"","arbitration agreement."
"30.","Therefore,  when  the  Defendant-Respondent,  SLIC,  raised  an  objection"
"","pursuant  to  Section  5  of  the  Arbitration  Act  No.  11  of  1995,  to  the"
"","maintainability  of  the  action,  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  learned  High"
"","Court  Judge  to  give  effect  to  the  parties'  autonomous  agreement  to"
"","arbitrate.  This  obligation  stands  unless 
the  matter  covered  by 
the"
"","arbitration  agreement  is  contrary  to  public  policy  or  is  not  capable  of"
"","determination by arbitration, as outlined in Section 4 of the Arbitration"
"","Act, No. 11 of 1995."
"31.","The  difference  or  dispute  between  the  parties  arose  from  a  contract,"
"","specifically the contract of insurance, and the merits of the dispute involve"
"","a  range  of  issues,  such  as  whether  there  was  a  breach  of  uberrima  fides,"
"","justifying  the  subsequent  repudiation  of  the  Appellant's  claim.  This"
"","dispute falls squarely within the scope of the arbitration agreement, which"
"","is  neither  tainted  by  public  policy  nor  incapable  of  determination  by"
"","arbitration."
"32.","Given the facts of the case and the nature of the dispute arising from the"
"","contract, this Court must lean in favor of upholding the arbitration clause."
