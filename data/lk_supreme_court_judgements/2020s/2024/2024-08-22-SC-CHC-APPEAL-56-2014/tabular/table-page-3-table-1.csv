"A. H. M. D. Nawaz, J.",""
"1.","This  appeal  stems  from  an  action  instituted  in  the  Commercial  High"
"","Court,  despite  the  presence  of  an  arbitration  agreement  within  the"
"","primary contract (Fire Insurance Policy) between the Plaintiff-Appellant"
"","and the Defendant-Respondent. The central issue in this appeal is whether"
"","a party to an arbitration agreement can establish an independent cause of"
"","action  based  on  the  correspondence  exchanged  between  the  parties,  as"
"","argued by the Plaintiff-Appellant in this case."
"2.","In  other  words,  the  Plaintiff-Appellant,  Eric  Peiris,  insisted  that  the"
"","proceedings be entertained and continued in the Commercial High Court,"
"","while  the  Defendant-Respondent,  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Co.  Ltd.  (SLIC),"
"","opposed the action, citing the arbitration agreement in the fire insurance"
"","policy."
"3.","The  learned  Commercial  High  Court  Judge  after  having  taken  evidence"
"","upheld the objection raised by the Sri Lanka Insurance Cooperation and"
"","concluded that there was no jurisdiction conferred on the court as a result"
"","of the arbitration agreement."
