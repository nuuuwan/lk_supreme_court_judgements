"24.      In using the word ‘difference’ in the arbitration agreement, both  parties"

"25.        In its context, it is useful to refer to the preamble to the Arbitration Act,"
"No. 11 of 1995, which, inter alia, states that one of the main objects of the"
"enactment was to give effect to the Convention on the Recognition and"
"Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (Done at New York, 10 June 1958;"
"Entered into force, 7 June 1959 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (1959) also known as the"
"""New York Convention"") and to provide for matters connected therewith"
"or incidental thereto"". In this connection, it is pertinent to look at Article"
"Il paragraph 1 of the said Convention, which provides that,"
"""Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the"
"parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have"
"arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,"
"whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by"
"arbitration"". (Emphasis added)."
"26.      Even the New York Convention, which the Arbitration Act, No. 11 of 1995"
"seeks to implement, uses the phrase ""any differences"" in the broadest sense"
"to signify a dispute between the parties. In this context, any ""difference"""
"regarding the quantum of loss or damage in the relevant arbitration clause"
