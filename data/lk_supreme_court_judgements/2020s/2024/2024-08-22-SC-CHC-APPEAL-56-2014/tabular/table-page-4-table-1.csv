"4.","In  essence,  the  arbitration  agreement 
in  the  main  contract—the  fire"
"","insurance policy—competes for recognition in this case against a separate"
"","contract 
that 
the 
Plaintiff-Appellant 
claims 
emerged 
from 
the"
"","correspondences, thereby providing the basis for a court action."
"5.","At  the  very  outset,  let  me  outline  the  basis  of  the  Plaintiff's  claim  to  a"
"","separate contract that provides the cause of action. This separate contract"
"","is claimed to be constituted by a letter marked 'P1,' dated March 18, 2008,"
"","in  which  the  Defendant-Respondent,  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation,"
"","offered  to  pay  a  sum  of  Rs.  8,195,162  in  full  and  final  settlement  of  the"
"","amount  due  under  the  fire  insurance  policy.  I  must  observe  that  the"
"","Plaintiff-Appellant assigns different classifications to the letter 'P1.' While"
"","'P1' itself uses the term ""offer to pay,"" the Plaintiff-Appellant characterizes"
"","it as an agreement, asserting that a breach of this agreement constitutes"
"","the cause of action."
"6.","At this stage, it is pertinent to refer to the facts of the case. The business"
"","entity  known  as  M/S  Peiris  Press,  designated  as  the  insured  in  the  fire"
"","insurance policy, entered into the contract of insurance for its industrial"
"","business premises, which included the building, along with fixtures and"
"","fittings, and two printing machines located in Minuwangoda."
"7.","The  printing  machinery  had  been  mortgaged  to  Hatton  National  Bank"
"","(HNB),  Minuwangoda,  and  HNB's  name  appears  in  the  Fire  Insurance"
