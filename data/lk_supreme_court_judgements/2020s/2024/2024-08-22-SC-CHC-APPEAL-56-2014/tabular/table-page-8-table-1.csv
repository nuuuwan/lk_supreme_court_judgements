"","case  due  to  the  arbitration  clause  in  the  main  contract  (Fire  Insurance"
"","Policy). This objection was made pursuant to Section 5 of the Arbitration"
"","Act No. 11 of 1995."
"16.","Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation  raised  the  demur  that  the  arbitration"
"","clause deprived the Commercial High Court of jurisdiction and, therefore,"
"","the  action  should  be  dismissed.  It  is  important  to  note  that  while  the"
"","Plaintiff  conceded  that  the  insurance  contract  contained  an  arbitration"
"","clause,  he  alleged  that  his  cause  of  action  arose  independently  of  that"
"","arbitration  agreement.  In  fact,  the  plaint  specifically  stated  that  “the"
"","Plaintiff’s present cause of action has not arisen out of the said clause.”"
"17.","Referring  to  'P1'  and  'P2,'  the  two  letters  sent  by  SLIC,  the  Plaintiff  -"
"","Appellant  attributed 
the  cause  of  action 
to 
these  communications."
"","According to 'P1,' “the Defendant had offered to pay a sum of Rs. 8,495,162 to the"
"","Plaintiff in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim.” However, in 'P2,' dated April 21, 2008,"
"","“when  the  Defendant  sought  to  obtain  the  said  monies,  the  Plaintiff  unilaterally"
"","withdrew the payment."""
"18.","The Plaintiff-Appellant argued that these letters, 'P1' and 'P2,' constituted"
"","the cause of action, entirely independent of the arbitration agreement. In"
"","other  words,  these  two  letters  stood  alone,  unconnected  to  the  arbitral"
"","clause. Therefore, the arbitration agreement could not denude the court of"
"","jurisdiction, as it was not triggered in this case. This was the argument"
