"circumstances, the virtual complainant had sufficient opportunity to see the faces"
"of 
the 
two  persons 
concerned.  She  queried  as 
to  whether 
in 
the  given"
"circumstances  the  virtual  complainant’s  subsequent  purported  identification  of"
"the accused at the identification parade would be accurate and reliable."
"21. Learned  counsel  also  submitted  that  the  prosecution  had  taken  no  effort  to"
"ascertain from the virtual complainant as to the features of the perpetrators’ faces,"
"which  enabled  her  to  identify  the  two  accused  at  the 
identification  parade."
"According  to  the  police  investigator,  even  when  the  virtual  complainant  was"
"interviewed and her statement recorded by the police, she had not revealed any"
"special identification features of the perpetrators. All what she has said was that"
"she would be able to identify if the perpetrators are seen again."
"22. She submitted that, particularly given the consistent position maintained by both"
"accused, that at the Akmeemana police station they were shown by the police to"
"the virtual complainant, there could not have been any value to be attached to the"
"identification  of  the  accused  at  the  identification  parade.  Learned  counsel  also"
"submitted  that  according  to  the  testimony  of  the  virtual  complainant,  several"
"traumatic  things  had  happened  to  her  within  a  short  period  of  time.  In  the"
"circumstances, it would be highly improbable that she would have had sufficient"
"time  and  clear  opportunity  to  properly  look  at  and  thereafter  recall  the  facial"
"identification  features  of  the  perpetrators.  Learned  counsel  also  submitted  that,"
"even if the virtual complainant had seen the person on the pillion of the motorcycle"
"who is said to have snatched her necklace, it is highly unlikely that she would have"
"seen the face of the person who rode the motorcycle (whom the prosecution alleges"
"is the 1st Accused – Appellant – Appellant)."
"23. Learned counsel for the Appellant also assailed the reliability of the identification"
"of the Appellant, on the premise that the accused had been shown to the virtual"
"complainant  the  day  before  the  identification  parade  at  the  Akmeemana  police"
"station. Learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to an entry made by the"
"learned Magistrate in “P1” (identification parade notes) when he set-about to hold"
"the  identification  parade,  that  the  Attorneys-at-Law  who  appeared  for  the  two"
"suspects (accused at the trial) objected to the conduct of the identification parade"
"on the footing that prior to the conduct of the identification parade, the witness"
"was provided with an opportunity to see the accused."
