"required  by  law  to  be  followed,  as  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  did  not"
"impugn  the  procedure  followed  by  the  learned  Magistrate  who  conducted  the"
"identification  parade  which  resulted 
in  the 
identification  of  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Accused."
"60. Be that as it may, what is critical is that for evidence of identification emanating"
"from the conduct of an identification parade to have any evidential value, as stated"
"by me earlier, the arrested suspect should not have been shown to the witness at"
"any  time  between  his  arrest  and  the  holding  of  the  identification  parade.  Nor"
"should a photograph of the arrested suspect be shown to the witness at any time"
"prior to the holding of the identification parade. Furthermore, the witness should"
"not have had an opportunity of seeing the suspect during that intervening period"
"of time. Particularly a trial court must be acutely conscious of the possibility of an"
"over-zealous  police  officer  engaging 
in  such 
inappropriate  conduct 
for 
the"
"purpose of ensuring that the suspect arrested by the police would be positively"
"identified at the identification parade."
"61. However, a mere objection by the Attorney-at-Law who represented the suspect"
"at the  identification parade that the suspect was shown to the witness while he"
"was in police custody and therefore is objecting to the conduct of the identification"
"parade  or  a  suggestion  by  the  defence  counsel  during  cross-examination  of  the"
"witness to that effect, should not necessarily give rise to a reasonable doubt that"
"the  suspect  was  shown  to  the  witness  prior  to  the  holding  of  the  identification"
"parade. However, if (a) the witness admits that such an improper procedure was"
"followed, 
(b) 
there 
is  direct  or  circumstantial  evidence 
in  support  of  such"
"allegation,  or  (c)  the  court  identifies  suspicious  conduct  by  the  police  in  that"
"regard, then the trial court must give its earnest attention to that aspect of the case"
"and  determine  whether  any  value  should  be  attributed 
to 
the  evidence  of"
"identification or recognition emanating from the identification parade."
"62. Should the eye-witnesses fall into category ‘(iv)’, he will not be able to assist the"
"investigator in causing the identification of the perpetrator."
"63. If the identification of the perpetrator was founded upon the situation contained"
"in category ‘(v)’, both the statement to the police made by the eye-witness as well"
"as the notes of investigation by the police officer(s) who arrived at the scene of the"
"crime should reflect that the arrest of the suspect was preceded by an ‘on the spot’"
