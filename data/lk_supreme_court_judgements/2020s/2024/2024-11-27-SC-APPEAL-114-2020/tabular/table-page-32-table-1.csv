"which forms part of the case record in issue. Thus, having tendered “P1” through"
"the virtual complainant Kamani Nilanka was not the correct procedure. However,"
"examining that aspect of this case is not required, particularly as the defence had"
"not objected to the document being produced."
"What  is  important  to  note  is  that  the  impugned  judgment  of  the  High  Court"
"contains  no  reference  by  which  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  learned  Judge  had"
"proceeded on the footing that the defence had ‘admitted’ that the perpetrators of"
"robbery (as alleged by the prosecution) were the two accused. He did not act on"
"the footing that the evidence relating to the identity of the accused were ‘admitted"
"facts’  for  the  purposes  of  section  58  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance.  All  what  the"
"learned Judge had done was to express the proposition that since the notes of the"
"identification  parade  (“P1”)  were  produced  by  the  prosecution  without  any"
"objection from the defence, the defence is estopped from challenging the fact that"
"the  identification  parade  was  held  in  the  manner  contained  in  “P1”  and  that  at"
"such parade the virtual complainant Kamani Nilanka identified the two suspects"
"arraigned at the parade (being the two accused) as being the perpetrators of the"
"robbery,  and  informed  such  fact  to  the  learned  Magistrate  who  conducted  the"
"identification parade."
