"Thus,  I  shall  reproduce  below,  excerpts  from  that 
judgment  at  some  length,"
"notwithstanding it resulting in the lengthening of this judgment."
"“
First, whenever the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on"
"the  correctness  of  one  or  more  identifications  of  the  accused  which  the  defence"
"alleges to be mistaken, the judge should warn the jury of the special need for caution"
"before convicting the accused in reliance on the correctness of the identification or"
"identifications. In addition, he should instruct them as to the reason for the need"
"for  such  a  warning  and  should  make  some  reference  to  the  possibility  that  a"
"mistaken witness can be a convincing one and that a number of such witnesses can"
"all be mistaken. Provided this is done in clear terms the judge need not use any"
"particular form of words."
"S
econdly, the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in"
"which the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did the witness"
"have the accused  under observation? At what distance? In  what light?  Was the"
"observation  impeded  in  any  way,  as  for  example  by  passing  traffic  or  a  press  of"
"people?  Had  the  witness  ever  seen  the  accused  before?  How  often?  If  only"
"occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long"

"given  to  the  police  by  the  witness  when 
first  seen  by  them  and  his  actual"
"appearance?  If  in  any  case,  whether  it  is  being  dealt  with  summarily  or  on"
"indictment,  the  prosecution  has  reason  to  believe  that  there  is  such  material"
"discrepancy they should supply the accused or his legal advisers with particulars of"
"the description the police were first given …"
"Finally, he should remind the jury of any specific weakness which had appeared in"
"the identification evidence."
"R
ecognition may be more reliable than identification of a stranger; but even when"
"the witness is purporting to recognise someone whom he knows, the jury should be"
"reminded that mistakes in recognition of close relatives and friends are sometimes"
"made."
"A
ll these matters go to the quality of identification evidence. If the quality is good"
"and  remains  good  at  the  close  of  the  accused’s  case,  the  danger  of  a  mistaken"
"identification is lessened; but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger. In our"
