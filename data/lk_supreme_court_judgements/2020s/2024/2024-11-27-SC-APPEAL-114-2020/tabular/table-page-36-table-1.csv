"89. There  is  another  aspect  of  the  case  for  the  prosecution  to  which  the  learned"
"Magistrate  and  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  ought  to  have  given  their"
"attention  to.  Given  the  fact  that  the  virtual  complainant  has  not  revealed  any"
"special identification features of the offenders to the police and there having been"
"no other eye-witnesses or circumstantial evidence, how were the investigators of"
"the Akmeemana police able to trace and arrest the suspects? Inspector Ihalawela"
"does not offer any explanation as to how they were able to locate and arrest the"
"offenders. The absence of such an explanation does lend some amount of credence"
"to  the  version  of  the  accused  that  they  were  taken-over  by  officers  of  the"
"Akmeemana  police  station,  when  they  went  to  the  Galle  police  station  to  mark"
"their presence at that police station as a condition of bail imposed in another case."
"Is  it  that  the  police  assumed  that  since  the  two  accused  had  a  ‘criminal  record’"
"(possibly of having committed a similar offence in the past), both of them were"
"responsible for having committed the robbery referred to in this case as well? Is"
"that why they took the two accused to the Akmeemana police station and showed"
"them to the virtual complainant?"
