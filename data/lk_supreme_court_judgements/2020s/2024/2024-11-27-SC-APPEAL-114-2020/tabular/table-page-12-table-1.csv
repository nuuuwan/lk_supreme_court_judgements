"","had adequate light, the perpetrator was seen at close proximity and she had ample"
"","opportunity to see the perpetrator."
"","34. Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that ‘merely wearing a helmet does not make"
"","it  difficult  to  identify  a  person’.  Furthermore,  she  submitted  that  there  was  no"
"","evidence that the helmet had a visor which the perpetrator was wearing, would"
"","have made it difficult to clearly see the perpetrator’s face."
"","35. In  view  of 
the 
foregoing, 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel  submitted 
that 
the"
"","prosecution had adequately discharged its burden of proving the identity of both"
"","accused beyond reasonable doubt."
"","36. Therefore, learned Senior State Counsel urged this Court to affirm the conviction"
"","and the sentence and dismiss the Appeal."
"V","isual identification of perpetrators of offences and the applicable law"
"","37. When  an  offence  is  committed,  a  critical  issue  that  immediately  arises  is  the"
"","identity  of  the  perpetrator  of  the  offence  (i.e.  the  person  who  committed  the"
"","offence). In certain instances, the identity of the perpetrator of the offence may be"
"","apparent, and in some others, it may need to be investigated into and ascertained."
"","While in a few cases the identity of the accused is not in issue, in most other cases,"
"","it  is  very  much  a  contentious  issue.  Therefore,  determining  the  identity  of  the"
"","perpetrator of the offence is considered a key component of most investigations"
"","into  offences.  That 
is  because,  during 
the  corresponding 
trial,  a 
foremost"
"","responsibility of the prosecution would be to prove beyond reasonable doubt that"
"","the person indicted (the accused) was in fact the perpetrator of the offence."
"","38. In 
any 
criminal  prosecution, 
the  prosecutor  must  necessarily  prove 
two"
"","components. They being,"
"","(a) that the offence contained in the indictment / charge sheet had been committed"
"","(as  alleged  and 
in 
the  manner  contained 
in 
the 
indictment  /  charge)  by"
"","whomsoever, and"
"","(b)  that  the  person  who  committed  such  offence  is  the  person  named  in  the"
"","indictment, who has been arraigned in the dock."
"","The  ability  of  the  prosecutor  to  perform  this  task  would  be  dependent  upon"
"","investigations  conducted 
into 
the  commission  of 
the  offence 
in 
issue.  The"
