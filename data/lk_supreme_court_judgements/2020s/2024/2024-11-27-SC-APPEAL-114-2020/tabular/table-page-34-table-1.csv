"asked  her 
to  describe 
features  of 
the 
face  of 
the  perpetrators  and  other"
"characteristics of the offenders which she noticed."
"F
urthermore, under cross-examination the virtual complainant has admitted that"
"at 
the 
time  of 
the 
incident,  both  accused  were  wearing  helmets. 
In 
the"
"circumstances,  what  exactly  of  the  external  appearance  of  the  faces  of  the  two"
"perpetrators  were  visible 
to 
the  virtual  complainant?  What  were 
the  other"
"externally  visible  characteristics  of  the  two  offenders  that  were  noticed  by  the"
"victim?"
"T
he  virtual  complainant  in  her  evidence  explains  how  the  motorcycle  initially"
"went past her. At that time, there was nothing special in a motorcycle going past"
"her in the opposite direction. Therefore, she does not say that she looked at the"
"faces of the rider and the man on the pillion. This is quite understandable and quite"
"natural, as there was no particular reason to do so. Thereafter, the motorcycle took"
"a turn and came up to her from her opposite direction. It passed her once again,"
"turned back and stopped. The man on the pillion, grappled with her and snatched"
"her necklace. As an act of resistance, she even sat on the pillion. She has identified"
"this person who robbed her necklace as the 2nd Accused. In the circumstances, it is"
"quite  possible that  she was able to see  the face  of the 2nd  Accused at very close"
"proximity.  It  is  quite  probable  that  it  is  due  to  such  circumstances  that  the  2nd"
"Accusedâ€™s  facial  appearance  got  impregnated  in  her  mind,  and  she  was  able  to"
"subsequently identify the 2nd Accused at the identification parade."
"I
t appears from the evidence of the virtual complainant that at no point of time did"
"the  rider  of 
the  motorcycle 
(supposedly 
the  1st  Accused)  get  off 
from 
the"
"motorcycle. She does not even say that the 1st Accused looked at her, let alone his"
"having come close to her. Furthermore, in so far as the 1st Accused is concerned, at"
"no point of time in her testimony does she even say that she looked at the face of"
"the rider of the motorcycle and thereby got an opportunity of seeing his face. If so,"
"how did she identify the 1st Accused initially at the identification parade held 20"
"days  following  the  incident  and  also  at  the  trial  held  nearly  7  years  after  the"
"incident? Was it a chance identification (at the identification parade selecting the"
"correct  suspect  could  have  been  occasioned  by  a  chance  of  1:7)  or  was  the"
"identification founded upon the police having shown the two accused to her at the"
"Akmeemana  police  station  on  the  day  before  the  holding  of  the  identification"
