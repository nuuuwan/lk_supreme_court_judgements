"judgment, when the quality is good, as for example when the identification is made"
"after  a  long  period  of  observation,  or  in  satisfactory  conditions  by  a  relative,  a"
"neighbour,  a  close  friend,  a  workmate  and  the  like,  the  jury  can  safely  be  left  to"
"assess the value of the identifying evidence even though there is no other evidence"
"to support it: provided always, however, that an adequate warning has been given"
"about the special need for caution … ."
"W
hen, in the judgment of the trial judge, the quality of the identifying evidence is"
"poor,  as  for  example  when  it  depends  solely  on  a  fleeting  glance  or  on  a  longer"
"observation made in difficult conditions, the situation is very different. The judge"
"should then withdraw the case from the jury and direct an acquittal unless there is"
"other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification. This may"
"be corroboration in the sense lawyers use that word; but it need not be so if its effect"
"is to make the jury sure that there had been no mistaken identification. For example,"
"X sees the accused snatch a woman’s handbag; he gets only a fleeting glance of the"
"thief’s face as he runs off, but he does see him entering a nearby house. Later, he"
"picks out the accused on an identity parade. If there was no more evidence than this,"
"the poor quality of the identification would require the judge to withdraw the case"
"from the jury; but this would not be so if there was evidence that the house into"
"which the accused was alleged by X to have run was his father’s. Another example"
"of supporting evidence not amounting to corroboration in a technical sense is to be"
"found in R v. Long (1973) 57 Criminal Appeal Reports 871 … ."
"The trial judge should identify to the jury the evidence which he adjudges is capable"
"of supporting the evidence of identification. If there is any evidence or circumstance"
"which the jury might think was supporting when it did not have this quality, the"
"judge should say so …"
"Care should be taken by the judge when directing the jury about the support for an"
"identification which may be derived from the fact that they have rejected an alibi."
"False alibis may be put forward for many reasons: an accused, for example, who has"
"only his own truthful evidence to rely on may stupidly fabricate an alibi and get"
"lying witnesses to support it out of fear that his own evidence will not be enough."
"Further, alibi witnesses can make genuine mistakes about dates and occasions like"
"any other witnesses can. It is only when the jury are satisfied that the sole reason"
"for the fabrication was to deceive them and there is no other explanation for its being"
"put forward, that fabrication can provide any support for identification evidence."
"The jury should be reminded that proving the accused has told lies about where he"
