"perceptions of human cognition. These phases of cognition and perceptions have"
"been most helpfully explained by Justice Evatt in the Australian case of Craig vs."
"The King [(1933) 49 Commonwealth Law Reports 429] in the following manner:"
"“An honest witness who says, ‘the prisoner is the man who drove the car’, whilst"
"appearing to affirm a simple, clear and impressive proposition, is really asserting:"
"(i) that he observed the car,"
"(ii) that the observation became impressed upon his mind,"
"(iii) that he still retains the original impression,"
"(iv) that such impression has not been affected, altered or replaced, by published"
"portraits of the prisoner, and"
"(v)  that  the  resemblance  between  the  original  impression  and  the  prisoner  is"
"sufficient to base a judgment not on resemblance but of identity.”"
