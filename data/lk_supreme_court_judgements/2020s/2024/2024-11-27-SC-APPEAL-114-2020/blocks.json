Any one of these situations can result in a mistaken and thus a wrong identification of the perpetrator, which unless considered carefully and rejected, would lead to a miscarriage of justice. Particularly in cases where there is no corroborative evidence to establish that the accused before court is in fact the person who had committed the offence, it is not only the credibility of the witness who provides evidence of identification that is central, the testimonial trustworthiness of such witnesss testimony would be of utmost importance. While issues surrounding the credibility of the witness would affect the veracity of the testimony, testimonial trustworthiness would have a bearing on the accuracy and reliability of the purported facts deposed to in the testimony of the witness. In such cases, the veracity of the testimony and the accuracy of the evidence of identification serve as the bedrock of the case. Particularly, trial courts exercising criminal jurisdiction must guard themselves against the possibility of fallacious or defective testimony relating to purported visual identification of the perpetrator of the offence.",

Court must exercise greatest possible caution and be circumspect when evaluating evidence relating to such investigative technique. Furthermore, following the arrest of the suspected perpetrator, an identification parade must be held in terms of the law, and the witness should have no opportunity of seeing the arrested person in the custody of the police either live or as seen in a photograph or a video.

In addition, he should instruct them as to the reason for the need for such a warning and should make some reference to the possibility that a mistaken witness can be a convincing one and that a number of such witnesses can all be mistaken. Provided this is done in clear terms the judge need not use any particular form of words. Secondly, the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in which the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police? Was there any material discrepancy between the description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual appearance?

When, in the judgment of the trial judge, the quality of the identifying evidence is poor, as for example when it depends solely on a fleeting glance or on a longer observation made in difficult conditions, the situation is very different. The judge should then withdraw the case from the jury and direct an acquittal unless there is other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification. This may be corroboration in the sense lawyers use that word; but it need not be so if its effect is to make the jury sure that there had been no mistaken identification. For example, X sees the accused snatch a womans handbag; he gets only a fleeting glance of the thiefs face as he runs off, but he does see him entering a nearby house. Later, he picks out the accused on an identity parade. If there was no more evidence than this, the poor quality of the identification would require the judge to withdraw the case from the jury; but this would not be so if there was evidence that the house into which the accused was alleged by X to have run was his fathers. Another example of supporting evidence not amounting to corroboration in a technical sense is to be found in R v. Long (1973) 57 Criminal Appeal Reports 871 .",

What matters is the quality of evidence. In such situations the evidence of the witness should demonstrate that there was sufficient opportunity for the witness to have seen the person concerned at the time of the incident and thereafter had the ability to identify the person concerned during his testimony in court. Factors such as, the duration of the interaction between the witness and the suspect, distance between them, the nature of the light under which the witness observed, whether there are any special reasons to remember the suspect such as presence of unique physical features, existence of any factors impeding the opportunity for clear and uninterrupted observation, whether the witness had seen the suspect before and if so the number of occasions and whether the suspect was known by name or not, are relevant to determine the quality of visual identification evidence. This list of factors is not exhaustive, but could vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case. These factors are equally relevant and important in situations of both identification and recognition. In Turnbull, guidelines were laid down in regard to evidence of visual identification in situations of fleeting glance or identification in difficult circumstances and subsequent jurisprudence clarified that such guidelines need not be adopted in each and every case of visual identification. However, in R v. Bowden [1993 Crim. L.R. 379] and Beckford and Others v. R [97 Cr. App. R. 409 at 415], the importance of Turnbull guidelines in cases of visual identification was re-emphasised.

Furthermore, under cross-examination the virtual complainant has admitted that at the time of the incident, both accused were wearing helmets. In the circumstances, what exactly of the external appearance of the faces of the two perpetrators were visible to the virtual complainant? What were the other externally visible characteristics of the two offenders that were noticed by the victim? The virtual complainant in her evidence explains how the motorcycle initially went past her. At that time, there was nothing special in a motorcycle going past her in the opposite direction. Therefore, she does not say that she looked at the faces of the rider and the man on the pillion. This is quite understandable and quite natural, as there was no particular reason to do so. Thereafter, the motorcycle took a turn and came up to her from her opposite direction. It passed her once again, turned back and stopped. The man on the pillion, grappled with her and snatched her necklace. As an act of resistance, she even sat on the pillion. She has identified this person who robbed her necklace as the 2nd Accused. In the circumstances, it is quite possible that she was able to see the face of the 2nd Accused at very close proximity. It is quite probable that it is due to such circumstances that the 2nd Accuseds facial appearance got impregnated in her mind, and she was able to subsequently identify the 2nd Accused at the identification parade. It appears from the evidence of the virtual complainant that at no point of time did the rider of the motorcycle (supposedly the 1st Accused) get off from the motorcycle. She does not even say that the 1st Accused looked at her, let alone his having come close to her. Furthermore, in so far as the 1st Accused is concerned, at no point of time in her testimony does she even say that she looked at the face of the rider of the motorcycle and thereby got an opportunity of seeing his face. If so, how did she identify the 1st Accused initially at the identification parade held 20 days following the incident and also at the trial held nearly 7 years after the incident? Was it a chance identification (at the identification parade selecting the correct suspect could have been occasioned by a chance of 1:7) or was the identification founded upon the police having shown the two accused to her at the Akmeemana police station on the day before the holding of the identification",

He had such duty, notwithstanding the learned Magistrates opinion that the credibility of the witness Kamani Nilanka had not been successfully assailed by the defence.

Inspector Ihalawela does not offer any explanation as to how they were able to locate and arrest the offenders. The absence of such an explanation does lend some amount of credence to the version of the accused that they were taken-over by officers of the Akmeemana police station, when they went to the Galle police station to mark their presence at that police station as a condition of bail imposed in another case. Is it that the police assumed that since the two accused had a criminal record (possibly of having committed a similar offence in the past), both of them were responsible for having committed the robbery referred to in this case as well? Is that why they took the two accused to the Akmeemana police station and showed them to the virtual complainant?",
