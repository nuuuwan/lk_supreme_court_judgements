"Court that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents colluded with the 7th Respondent or that the"
"1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents distorted facts in their reports to the Attorney General."
"H
aving considered the material presented by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and"
"the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
"substantiate  the  allegation  that  the  1st,  2nd  and  4th  Respondents  did  not  carry  out  an"
"impartial and independent investigation. I must state that although the report prepared"
"at the direction of this Court identifies certain instances where the investigating officers"
"could have acted expeditiously, this is not the complaint of the Petitioner to this Court."
"To the contrary, it is clear that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have proceeded cautiously,"
"reported facts to the Magistrateâ€™s Court and sought the advice of the Attorney General"
