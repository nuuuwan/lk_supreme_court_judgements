Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner was 40 years of age at the time this application was filed on 17th September

2014. She is the mother of two children, now aged 28 and 31 from her first husband. In

2005, the Petitioner had married the 7th Respondent who was employed at the Pradeshiya

Sabha, Marawila. She had two more children from her marriage to the 7th Respondent.

These two children are now 17 and 20 years of age.

The Petitioner claims that since 2004, the 7th Respondent had sexually abused the

younger daughter of the Petitioner from her first marriage as well as the two children

from their marriage. Details of such abuse that the Petitioner claims took place over the

years are set out in the petition. The petition also includes details of the steps taken by

the Petitioner to bring the said incidents to the attention of law enforcement authorities

and the several complaints that she made to the Children and Women Bureau of the Sri

Lanka Police and to the National Child Protection Authority. The Petitioner admits that

pursuant to such complaints, the children who are said to have been abused by the 7th

Respondent have been produced before Judicial Medical Officers on several occasions

and facts have been reported by the Police to the Magistrates Court, Marawila and the

Juvenile Magistrates Court, Battaramulla.

The Petitioners complaint to this Court is that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents, they being

the Director, Children and Women Bureau of the Police Department, its Officer in -

Charge Inspector of Police Samson Fernando, and the Officer in - Charge of the

Investigation Unit at the National Child Protection Authority, Inspector of Police

Bopitigoda, respectively, colluded with the 7th Respondent and as a result:

(a) the investigations that were carried out were neither impartial nor independent;

(b) the reports filed in the Magistrates Court did not disclose the correct circumstances;

(c) false and distorted reports were submitted to the Attorney General which resulted

in the Attorney General advising the Police that the material available is insufficient

to maintain criminal proceedings against the 7th Respondent.

The Petitioner has claimed that by the above action/inaction, the 1st, 2nd and 4th

Respondents have infringed her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1).

Pursuant to this application being filed, but prior to leave being granted, the Attorney

General had called for the case records of the two cases pending before the Magistrates

Court of Marawila and the Juvenile Magistrates Court, Battaramulla and directed the 6th

Respondent, the Inspector General of Police to record fresh statements of the three

children who were said to have been abused by the 7th Respondent and that they be

examined by Medical Consultants.

While action was being taken by the 6th Respondent in terms of the above direction of

the Attorney General, leave to proceed was granted on 9th November 2015 for the alleged

violation by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 12(1). This Court had at the same time directed the 6th Respondent

to investigate the allegations leveled by the Petitioner on the conduct of the 2nd and 4th

Respondents and to submit a report to Court.

An investigation had accordingly been carried out by an Assistant Superintendent of

Police and the report filed on 1st February 2016 in compliance with the said order sets out

in detail the steps that had been taken by (a) the Children and Women Bureau during the

period 12th May 2010 31st December 2010 when the Officer in Charge was Chief

Inspector Balachandra, who is not a respondent to this application, (b) the Children and

Women Bureau during the period 1st January 2011 13th November 2013 when the

Officer in Charge was the 2nd Respondent, and (c) the National Child Protection

Authority during the period that the 4th Respondent was the Officer in Charge of the

Special Investigation Unit of the said Authority.

According to the said report, although the Children and Women Bureau had recorded the

statements of the children, submitted them for multiple medical examinations and

reported facts to both Magistrates Court, in view of (a) the contradictory nature of the

statements of the children from the second marriage, and (b) the younger daughter of

the Petitioner from her first marriage denying that she had been abused by the 7th

Respondent, the Children and Women Bureau had sought the advice of the Attorney

5

General on 4th June 2011. Similar steps had been taken by the National Child Protection

Authority which too had sought the advice of the Attorney General on 29th February 2012.

Thus, not only have investigations been carried out and the children been medically

examined, the advice of the Attorney General too had been sought long before this

application was filed. In this background, the complaint of the Petitioner that the

Respondents did not act independently cannot be accepted.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the Attorney General had considered

the relevant material, including a statement made to the Magistrate by the younger

daughter of the Petitioner from her first marriage where she is said to have denied having

been abused by the 7th Respondent and that a decision had been taken only thereafter

that the material available is insufficient to file charges against the 7th Respondent.

Accordingly, by his letter dated 27th January 2014, the Attorney General had advised the

Director, Children and Women Bureau to inform the relevant Magistrates Courts that

legal proceedings shall not be instituted against the 7th Respondent. This application was

filed pursuant to the advice of the Attorney General.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that after having received the case

records of the two Magistrates Court cases, the Attorney General had directed the

National Child Protection Authority to record fresh statements from the three children

who the Petitioner claimed had been sexually abused by the 7th Respondent and to have

them examined by Medical Consultants. In their statements and in the medical reports,

copies of which have been tendered to Court, the three children had once again denied

having been abused by the 7th Respondent. The children had further stated that it is the

Petitioner who physically abused them and that they were instigated by the Petitioner to

make false allegations against the 7th Respondent.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the Attorney General had considered

the material afresh and arrived at the conclusion that the material is insufficient to file

criminal charges against the 7th Respondent. While the necessity for the Attorney General

to provide any further advise to the Police had therefore not arisen, the aforementioned

statements of the three children do not support the complaint of the Petitioner to this

6

Court that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents colluded with the 7th Respondent or that the

1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents distorted facts in their reports to the Attorney General.

Having considered the material presented by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and

the learned Senior State Counsel, I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to

substantiate the allegation that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents did not carry out an

impartial and independent investigation. I must state that although the report prepared

at the direction of this Court identifies certain instances where the investigating officers

could have acted expeditiously, this is not the complaint of the Petitioner to this Court.

To the contrary, it is clear that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have proceeded cautiously,

reported facts to the Magistrates Court and sought the advice of the Attorney General

before proceeding to prosecute the 7th Respondent.

In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have not acted

in an arbitrary manner nor have they violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

This application is accordingly dismissed without costs.
