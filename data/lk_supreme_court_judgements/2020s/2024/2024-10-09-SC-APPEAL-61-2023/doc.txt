Introduction

The accused-appellant (accused) was charged in the Magistrates Court

of Mawanella with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to his uncle (the

younger brother of the accuseds father) on 15.01.2013 by assaulting him

with a club, an offence punishable under section 316 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, in addition to the injured person, five other witnesses testified

for the prosecution. For the defence, the accused, his parents, and one

Kapila gave evidence. The accused denied the assault and took up the

defence of alibi. He stated that he was at Warakapola at the material time

and that his uncles injuries were caused by his father, not by him. The

learned Magistrate rejected the defence of alibi and convicted the

accused. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the conviction. Hence this

appeal by the accused.

The two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted are as

follows:

4

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

(a) Did the learned High Court Judge erroneously exclude the defence

of alibi?

(b) Did the learned High Court Judge erroneously conclude that the

accused committed the offence despite insufficient evidence?

Insufficient evidence

The question (b) above is primarily based on identification. There are no

other eye-witnesses who saw the accused assaulting the injured person.

The injured person identified the accused as his assailant. He was

assaulted with an object, which he thinks was an iron rod, resulting in

grievous injury to his right hand. The Medico-Legal Report supports this

version. Since he is the son of his brother, there could not have been a

difficulty in identification although the incident took place around 7.00

pm. All were living on the same land. The evidence of the wife of the

injured person was that she ran to the place where her injured husband

was lying fallen after hearing him shouting that Sujeewa had assaulted

him. Sujeewa is the accused.

There was a motive behind this assault. On the same day, prior to the

incident in question, the injured person, while under the influence of

alcohol, had committed house trespass and attempted to stab the

accuseds father with a knife. The evidence of the accuseds parents in

the instant case was that, during that incident, the accuseds father who

is visually impaired (a blind person) had defended himself by striking the

injured person with his walking stick. This has not been believed by the

learned Magistrate. It is improbable that a grievous injury, such as an

open fracture of the distal humerus above the elbow joint of the right arm

as described in the Medico-Legal Report, could have been inflicted by a

walking stick, particularly by a person who is visually impaired. In

relation to the previous incident, the police had filed a separate case,

which resulted in the conviction of the injured person in this case. He

5

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

was ordered, among other penalties, to pay a sum of Rs. 15,000 as

compensation to the accuseds father.

There had been long-standing enmity between the accuseds father and

the injured person (two brothers) over some land disputes. As the learned

Magistrate correctly points out, when enmity exists between the two

brothers, there is no reason for the injured person to falsely implicate his

nephew for the assault instead of his brother.

I am not inclined to think that the Magistrates Court convicted the

accused on insufficient evidence.

Defence of alibi

The main contention of learned counsel for the accused before this Court

is that the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge who

affirmed the conviction erred in rejecting the defence of alibi. An alibi,

originating from the Latin word for elsewhere, typically serves as a

defence whereby the accused contends that he was not present at the

scene of the crime during the material time but was instead at a specific

other location, thus rendering his participation in the offence certainly

impossible. Section 126A(3) of our Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 and section 6A(3) of the UK Criminal Procedure and

Investigations Act 1996 provides a comparable definition.

An alibi is a strong defence that, if accepted, entirely destroys the

prosecution case. By demonstrating that the accused was elsewhere, the

alibi conclusively negates the prosecutions ability to prove the accuseds

participation in the alleged offence.

However, the defence of alibi taken up by the accused in this case is not

entitled to succeed primarily because the accused disclosed this defence

for the first time in his evidence. This defence was never suggested to any

6

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

of the prosecution witnesses including the two police witnesses who

investigated this incident. There is no evidence that the accused disclosed

such a defence in his statement to the police or at any time during the

police investigation.

Section 126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

The defence of alibi is now governed by statutory provisions, not by

common law. The Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 was

amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 14 of

2005 by which section 126A was introduced.

126A (1) No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in

the High Court to adduce evidence in support of the defence of an

alibi, unless he has

(a) stated such fact to the police at the time of his making his

statement during the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been served, with

notice to the Attorney-General at any time prior to fourteen days

of the date of commencement of the trial:

Provided however, the Court may, if it is of opinion that the accused

has adduced reasons which are sufficient to show why he delayed

to raise the defence of alibi within the period set out above, permit

the accused at any time thereafter but prior to the conclusion of the

case for the prosecution, to raise the defence of alibi.

(2) The original statement should contain all such information as to

the time and place at which such person claims he was and details

as to the persons if any, who may furnish evidence in support of his

alibi.

7

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

(3) For the purposes of this section evidence in support of an alibi

means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of

the defendant at a particular place or in particular area at a

particular time he was not, or was not likely to have been, at the

place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time

of the alleged commission.

In terms of section 126A(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, no

person on trial in the High Court may raise the defence of alibi unless he

had raised it during the investigation, providing all relevant details in

support of the alibi, or has notified the Attorney General at least 14 days

prior to the trial. The legislature now places an onus on the accused to

give prior notice of the defence of alibi. If the accused fails to do so, it

does not merely weaken the alibi but renders it inadmissible. This

principle should apply not only to trials before the High Court but also to

those before the Magistrates Court.

In terms of section 126A(2) and (3), a mere statement by the accused

claiming that he was not present at the scene of the offence is insufficient.

The disclosure of an alibi should be given with sufficient particularity to

enable the police to meaningfully investigate the defence of alibi. Hence,

such disclosure of an alibi must not only state that the accused was not

present at the location of the crime when it was committed, but also

specify where he was at that time, and the names of any witnesses

supporting the alibi. Section 6A(2) and (3) of the UK Criminal Procedure

and Investigations Act 1996, which cover the same, are couched in

stronger terms.

However, according to the proviso to section 126A(1), the Court may

permit the defence of alibi to be raised later, but before the conclusion of

the prosecution case, if sufficient and satisfactory reasons for the delay

are provided. In this regard, the Court should exercise its discretion

8

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

judicially, not arbitrarily. In Sri Lanka, as the law stands today, the

defence of alibi cannot be raised for the first time during the defence case

as was done in the instant case. If the Court permits, it must be before

the conclusion of the prosecution case.

The failure to disclose an alibi timeously is a factor which can properly

be taken into account in the evaluation of the evidence as a whole. Alibi

evidence presented for the first time at trial does not carry the same

weight or persuasive force as it would if it was raised promptly at the

outset of the accusation and consistently upheld throughout. If the alibi

is genuine, the accused could easily refute the baseless accusations by

disclosing his whereabouts to the police at the time of the incident. He

should be able to provide full details timeously, enabling further

investigation and potentially preventing charges from being filed against

him. It would be unlikely, if not improbable, for an accused who was

genuinely elsewhere at the time of the offence to withhold such a defence

and wait until criminal proceedings are instituted to disclose it for the

first time during trial.

However, I must hasten to add that the pre-trial silence of an accused

person should not be construed as an inference of guilt. As will be

discussed further in this judgment, there may be several reasons for

withholding information or making false statements during investigation.

In Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld

a Florida statute requiring a defendant intending to rely on an alibi to

disclose the names of his alibi witnesses to the prosecution, which failure

could result in the exclusion of such evidence at trial. The Supreme Court

held that the notice-of-alibi rule does not violate the defendants rights to

due process, a fair trial or the privilege against self-incrimination.

Delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice White, at pages 81-82,

observed that the administration of justice is not akin to a poker game

9

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until

played but rather a serious proceeding aimed at uncovering the truth.

Given the ease with which an alibi can be fabricated, the States

interest in protecting itself against an eleventh-hour defense is both

obvious and legitimate. Reflecting this interest, notice-of-alibi

provisions, dating at least from 1927, are now in existence in a

substantial number of States. The adversary system of trial is hardly

an end in itself; it is not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an

absolute right always to conceal their cards until played. We find

ample room in that system, at least as far as due process is

concerned, for the instant Florida rule, which is designed to enhance

the search for truth in the criminal trial by insuring both the

defendant and the State ample opportunity to investigate certain

facts crucial to the determination of guilt or innocence.

The Constitutional Court of South Africa in the case of Thebus and

Another v. The State [2003] ZACC 12 at para 68 stated:

The failure to disclose an alibi timeously is therefore not a neutral

factor. It may have consequences and can legitimately be taken into

account in evaluating the evidence as a whole. In deciding what, if

any, those consequences are, it is relevant to have regard to the

evidence of the accused, taken together with any explanation offered

by her or him for failing to disclose the alibi timeously within the

factual context of the evidence as a whole.

The European Court of Human Rights in the case of John Murray v. The

United Kingdom (Application No. 18731/91, decided on 8 February 1996,

at para 47) held:

On the one hand, it is self-evident that it is incompatible with the

immunities under consideration to base a conviction solely or mainly

10

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

on the accuseds silence or on a refusal to answer questions or to

give evidence himself. On the other hand, the Court deems it equally

obvious that these immunities cannot and should not prevent that

the accuseds silence, in situations which clearly call for an

explanation from him, be taken into account in assessing the

persuasiveness of the evidence adduced by the prosecution.

Wherever the line between these two extremes is to be drawn, it

follows from this understanding of the right to silence that the

question whether the right is absolute must be answered in the

negative.

It cannot be said therefore that an accuseds decision to remain

silent throughout criminal proceedings should necessarily have no

implications when the trial court seeks to evaluate the evidence

against him. In particular, as the Government have pointed out,

established international standards in this area, while providing for

the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination, are

silent on this point.

Whether the drawing of adverse inferences from an accuseds

silence infringes Article 6 is a matter to be determined in the light of

all the circumstances of the case, having particular regard to the

situations where inferences may be drawn, the weight attached to

them by the national courts in their assessment of the evidence and

the degree of compulsion inherent in the situation.

Burden of proof of alibi

Under Section 5 of the Evidence Ordinance, evidence may be given only

regarding facts in issue and relevant facts. Evidence admitted in

disregard of this provision is deemed improperly admitted, and a

conviction may be quashed if such evidence results in a miscarriage of

11

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

justice (The Queen v. Sodige Singho Appu (1959) 62 NLR 112). Section 5

of the Evidence Ordinance enacts:

Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or

non-existence of every fact in issue, and of such other facts as are

hereinafter declared to be relevant and of no others.

According to section 11 of the Evidence Ordinance, facts that are

inconsistent with the fact in issue are deemed relevant. Alibi evidence can

be led on this basis. Section 11 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

Facts not otherwise relevant are relevant

(a) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;

(b) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the

existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact

highly probable or improbable.

Illustration

(a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Colombo on a

certain day. The fact that on that day A was at Galle is relevant.

The fact that near the time when the crime was committed A was

at a distance from the place where it was committed, which

would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he

committed it, is relevant.

According to section 103 of the Evidence Ordinance the burden is on the

accused to prove alibi.

The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who

wishes the Court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by

any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.

12

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

Illustration

B wishes the Court to believe that, at the time in question, he was

elsewhere. He must prove it.

Quoting this illustration, Prof. G.L. Peiris in his book The Law of Evidence

in Sri Lanka, 1st Edition (1974), page 411 states The particular fact is one

in the existence of which he wishes the court to believe. Accordingly, in

keeping with the principle recognized by section 103, the burden of proof

as to the particular fact lies upon B.

Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance defines what is meant by proved and

disproved:

A fact is said to be proved when, after considering all the matters

before it, the Court either believes it to exist or considers its existence

so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of

the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.

A fact is said to be disproved when, after considering the matters

before it, the Court either believes that it does not exist, or considers

its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the

circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that

it does not exist.

A fact is said not to be proved when it is neither proved nor

disproved.

The Penal Code recognizes both general and special exceptions to

criminal liability, and in such cases also, the burden falls on the accused

to establish these exceptions. The accused should prove any general or

special exception on a balance of probability (The King v. Don Nikulas

Buiya (1942) 43 NLR 385, Perera v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1978-79] 2 Sri

LR 84, Chaminda v. Attorney General (SC/APPEAL/97/2012, SC Minutes

13

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

of 13.09.2023). The burden of proof in relation to general and special

exceptions are dealt with under section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance:

When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the

general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception

or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code or in any

law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume

the absence of such circumstances.

Section 4(2) of the Evidence Ordinance states that Whenever it is directed

by this Ordinance that the Court shall presume a fact, it shall regard such

fact as proved unless and until it is disproved.

The Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. James Chandrasekera (1942)

44 NLR 97 acknowledged the fact that the burden rests on the accused

to prove exceptions to criminal liability:

Where, in a case in which any general or special exception under the

Penal Code is pleaded by an accused person and the evidence relied

upon by such accused person fails to satisfy the Jury affirmatively

of the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the

exception pleaded, the accused is not entitled to be acquitted if, upon

a consideration of the evidence as a whole, a reasonable doubt is

created in the minds of the Jury as to whether he is entitled to the

benefit of the exception pleaded.

The fundamental principle in criminal law is that the burden of proving

the charge beyond a reasonable doubt lies solely with the prosecution

and never shifts to the accused. That refers to the overall burden of proof

or legal burden contemplated in section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Therefore, the shifting of the burden referred to previously does not

diminish the prosecutions responsibility to prove the case beyond a

14

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

reasonable doubt. The burden shifts only after the prosecution has

established its case, not before that stage is reached. In James

Chandrasekeras case, Howard C.J. at page 112 explained this as follows:

Section 105 of our Evidence Ordinance in no way lessens the onus

which always remains upon the prosecution. All that section lays

down is that:- When a person is accused of any offence, the burden

of proving the existence of circumstances, bringing the case within

any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any

special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same

Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court

shall presume the absence of such circumstances, and illustration

(b) to that section shows that, inter alia, the burden of proving

sudden provocation (which would reduce the offence, in accordance

with the terms of Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code, to one

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder) is a burden which is

on the accused. This burden, however, can never arise unless the

Crown has already produced evidence sufficient in law to satisfy the

Jury, in the absence of evidence from the defence, that the killing

amounted to culpable homicide committed with one of the intentions

or with the knowledge described in section 300 of the Penal Code.

It may be relevant to refer to the Indian jurisprudence regarding the

burden of proof of alibi as the statutory provisions in Sri Lanka and India

are analogous. While our Courts are hesitant to declare that the accused

must prove an alibi, the Supreme Court of India has consistently held

that the onus is on the accused to prove an alibi with affirmative

evidence.

Sarkars Law of Evidence, Vol I, 15th Edition (1993), page 210 states:

15

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

A plea of alibi must be proved with absolute certainty so as to

completely exclude the possibility of the presence of the person

concerned at the place of occurrence (State of Maharashtra v.

Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple, AIR 1984 SC 63, 67: 1984 Cri LJ 4;

Mukter Ahmed v. State, 1983 Cri LJ NOC 221 (Cal) (DB); Dalel Singh

v. Jag Mohan Singh, 1981 Cri LJ 667 (Del): 1981 Rajdhani LR 68).

In Binay Kumar Singh v. The State of Bihar (AIR 1997 SC 322), speaking

on behalf of the Supreme Court of India, Thomas J. held at page 328:

We must bear in mind that alibi not an exception (special or general)

envisaged in the Indian Penal code or any other law. It is only a rule

of evidence recognised in Section 11 of the Evidence Act that facts

which are inconsistent with the fact in issue are relevant. Illustration

(A) given under the provision is worth reproducing in this context:

The question is whether A committed a crime at Calcutta on a

certain date; the fact that on that date, A was at Lahore is relevant.

The Latin word alibi means elsewhere and that word is used for

convenience when an accused takes recourse to a defence line that

when the occurrence took place he was so far away from the place

of occurrence that it is extremely improbable that he would have

participated in the crime. It is basic law that in a criminal case, in

which the accused is alleged to have inflicted physical injury to

another person, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the

accused was present at the scene and has participated in the crime.

The burden would not be lessened by the mere fact that the accused

has adopted the defence of alibi. The plea of the accused in such

cases need be considered only when the burden has been

discharged by the prosecution satisfactorily. But once the

prosecution succeeds in discharging the burden it is incumbent on

16

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

the accused, who adopts the plea of alibi to prove it with absolute

certainty so as to exclude the possibility of his presence at the place

of occurrence. When the presence of the accused at the scene of

occurrence has been established satisfactorily by the prosecution

through reliable evidence, normally the court would be slow to

believe any counter evidence to the effect that he was elsewhere

when the occurrence happened. But if the evidence adduced by the

accused is of such a quality and of such a standard that the court

may entertain some reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the

scene when the occurrence took place, the accused would, no doubt,

be entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt. For that purpose,

it would be a sound proposition to be laid down that in such

circumstances, the burden on the accused is rather heavy. It follows,

therefore, that strict proof is required for establishing the plea of

alibi. This Court has observed so on earlier occasions (vide Dudh

Nath Pandey v. State of Utter Pradesh (1981) 2 SCC 166; state of

Maharashtra v. Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple AIR 1984 SC 63).

In the Supreme Court case of Rajindra Singh v. State of U.P. and Another

(AIR 2007 SC 2786 at 2790), Mathur J. declared:

That apart, the plea taken by the respondent Kapil Dev Singh in his

petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was that of alibi. Section 103 of

the Evidence Act says that the burden of proof as to any particular

fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in its

existence, unless it is proved by any law that the proof of that fact

lies on any particular person. The second illustration to section 103

reads as under:

B wishes the Court to believe that at the time in question, he was

elsewhere. He must prove it.

17

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

This provision makes it obvious that the burden of establishing the

plea of alibi set up by the respondent No. 2 in the petition filed by

him under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court lay squarely

upon him. There is hardly any doubt regarding this legal proposition.

See Gurcharan Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1956 SC 460,

Chandrika Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar AIR 1972 SC 109 and

State of Haryana v. Sher Singh AIR 1981 SC 1021.

In State of Maharashtra v. Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple (AIR 1984 SC 63

at 67), Fazal Ali J. stated that alibi must be proved with absolute

certainty:

It is well settled that a plea of alibi must be proved with absolute

certainty so as to completely exclude the possibility of the presence

of the person concerned at the place of occurrence.

In a similar vein, in Dhananjoy Chaterjee v. State of West Bengal (1994

(2) SCC 220), the Supreme Court of India emphasized the necessity of

proving alibi by cogent and satisfactory evidence:

Though it is not necessary for an accused to render an explanation

to prove his innocence and even if he renders a false explanation, it

cannot be used to support the prosecution case against him and that

the entire case must be proved by the prosecution itself but it is well

settled that a plea of alibi, if raised by an accused is required to be

proved by him by cogent and satisfactory evidence so as to

completely exclude the possibility of the presence of the accused at

the place of occurrence at the relevant time. The belated and vague

plea of alibi of which we find no whisper during the cross-

examination of any of the prosecution witnesses and which has not

been sought to be established by leading any evidence is only an

afterthought and a plea of despair.

18

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

The Supreme Court of India in Jayantibhai Bhenkarbhai v. State of

Gujarat (AIR 2002 SC 3569) made it clear that the burden shifts to the

accused to establish the alibi with certainty only after the prosecution

has proved the accuseds guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The burden of proving commission of offence by the accused so as to

fasten the liability of guilty on him remains on the prosecution and

would not be lessened by the mere fact that the accused had

adopted the defence of alibi. The plead of alibi taken by the accused

needs to be considered only when the burden which lies on the

prosecution has been discharged satisfactorily. If the prosecution

has failed in discharging its burden of proving the commission of

crime by the accused beyond any reasonable doubt, it may not be

necessary to go into the question whether the accused has

succeeded in proving the defence of alibi. But once the prosecution

succeeds in discharging its burden then it is incumbent on the

accused taking the plea of alibi to prove it with certainty so as to

exclude the possibility of his presence at the place and time of

occurrence. An obligation is cast on the Court to weigh in scales the

evidence adduced by the prosecution in proving of the guilt of the

accused and the evidence adduced by the accused in proving his

defence of alibi. If the evidence adduced by the accused is of such a

quality and of such a standard that the Court may entertain some

reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the place and time of

occurrence, the Court would evaluate the prosecution evidence to the

see if the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution leaves any

slot available to fit therein the defence of alibi. The burden of the

accused is undoubtedly heavy. This flows from Section 103 of the

Evidence Act which provides that the burden of proof as to any

particular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in

its existence. However, while weighing the prosecution case and the

19

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

defence case, pitted against each other, if the balance tilts in favour

of the accused, the prosecution would fail and the accused would be

entitled to benefit of that reasonable doubt which would emerge in

the mind of the Court.

The same view was expressed by Dias J. in the oft-quoted case of The

King v. Marshall (1948) 51 NLR 157 at 159:

An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability like a plea of private

defence or grave and sudden provocation. An alibi is nothing more

than an evidentiary fact, which like other facts relied on by an

accused must be weighed in the scale against the case for the

prosecution. In a case where an alibi is pleaded, if the prisoner

succeeds thereby in creating a sufficient doubt in the minds of the

Jury as to whether he was present at the scene at the time the

offence was committed, then the prosecution has not established its

case beyond all reasonable doubt, and the accused is entitled to be

acquittedRex v. Chandrasekera (1942) 44 NLR at 126 and Rex v.

Fernando (1947) 48 NLR at 251.

In view of the provisions of section 103 of the Evidence Ordinance,

together with the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of India, the

judgment in Marshalls case should not be misinterpreted to suggest that

the accused bears no burden of proving an alibi. However, in practical

terms, if the accused, through the defence of alibi, creates a reasonable

doubt about the prosecution case, it is considered that the accused has

discharged this burden.

At this stage, it may not be inappropriate to clarify the meaning of proof

beyond reasonable doubt. In Miller v. Minister of Pensions [1947] 2 All ER

372, Lord Denning declared at page 373:

20

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the

shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote

possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence

of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case is

proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

The prosecution must prove the accuseds guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt, not beyond any doubt. A reasonable doubt refers to a doubt

based on logical reasoning through proper evaluation of evidence. This

requires the trier of fact to weigh all evidence supporting guilt against

evidence suggesting innocence, considering the strengths and

weaknesses on both sides. If, after this evaluation, the evidence

overwhelmingly favors the prosecution and eliminates any reasonable

doubt about the guilt of the accused, the case can be deemed proven

beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard applies to the totality of the

evidence as a whole, not to each individual piece of evidence the

prosecution relies on to prove the guilt of the accused.

In the celebrated House of Lord decision of Woolmington v. DPP [1935] AC

462 at 481-482 Viscount Sankey L.C. with the concurrence of Lord

Hewart L.C.J., Lord Atkin, Lord Tomlin and Lord Wright stated:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread

is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove

the prisoners guilt subject to what I have already said as to the

defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at

the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt,

created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the

prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a

21

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and

the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or

where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt

of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt

to whittle it down can be entertained.

As Granville Williams states in The Proof of Guilt (2nd Edition, London

Stevens & Sons Limited, 1958) page 153:

What lies at the bottom of the various rules shifting the burden of

proof is the idea that it is impossible for the prosecution to give

wholly convincing evidence on certain issues from its own hand, and

it is therefore for the accused to give evidence on them if he wishes

to escape. This idea is perfectly defensible and needs to be

expressed in legal rules, but it is not the same as the burden of proof.

As T.S. Fernando J. in Yahonis Singho v. The Queen (1964) 67 NLR 8 and

H.N.G. Fernando C.J. in Damayanu v. The Queen (1969) 73 NLR 61

pointed out, if the evidence concerning the alibi is neither accepted nor

rejected but remains inconclusive, this uncertainty would create a

reasonable doubt about the prosecution case, thereby warranting the

acquittal of the accused.

In Asela De Silva v. Attorney General (SC/APPEAL/14/2011, SC Minutes

of 17.01.2014), Marsoof J. stated at page 7 that in a case where an alibi

has been pleaded, it is necessary to examine whether in the totality of all

evidence led at the trial, a reasonable doubt arises as to the guilt of the

accused in the face of the plea of alibi taken up by him.

In Tshiki v. The State [2020] ZASCA 92, the Supreme Court of Appeal of

South Africa at para 32 observed that It is trite that there is no onus on

the accused person to establish their alibi. If it might be reasonably true

they must be acquitted and it does not have to be considered in isolation

22

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

from other evidence. The correct approach is to consider it in the light of the

totality of the evidence presented before court.

In R v. Hlongwane [1959] (3) SA 337 (A) at 339, Holmes JA declared:

At the conclusion of the whole case the issues were (a) whether the

alibi might reasonably be true and (b) whether the denial of

complicity might reasonably be true. An affirmative answer to either

(a) or (b) would mean that the Crown failed to prove beyond

reasonable doubt that the accused was one of the robbers.

In Australia and the UK, the approach to the burden of proof concerning

alibi is more favorable to the accused compared to India. Australian

Courts expect the prosecution to disprove the alibi beyond a reasonable

doubt. However, disprove does not imply a separate or distinct exercise.

It aligns with the general burden on the prosecution, which is to prove

its case beyond reasonable doubt.

In Wark v. The State of Western Australia [2020] WASCA 19 at para 364,

Buss J. had this to say:

Where an accused gives, adduces or points to evidence of an alibi,

no onus of proving the alibi rests on the accused. The burden of

proving the accuseds guilt beyond reasonable doubt remains upon

the State. It is necessary for the State to remove any reasonable

doubt which the alibi may create. If the State fails to satisfy the

tribunal of fact beyond reasonable doubt that the alibi evidence

should be rejected, then the accused must be found not guilty. The

State must eliminate any reasonable possibility that the alibi is true

before the accused can be convicted. If the State satisfies the tribunal

of fact beyond reasonable doubt that the alibi evidence should be

rejected, it does not follow that the tribunal of fact must necessarily

23

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

find the accused guilty. The burden remains upon the State to prove

beyond reasonable doubt each element of the charged offence.

In the same case, at para 618, Beech J. added:

I accept that there are many cases, including some cited by Buss P

at [364], holding that an alibi must be disproved beyond reasonable

doubt. As I have said, I accept that the State must disprove alibi

beyond reasonable doubt. However, that does not mean that

disproof of the alibi is a separate or intermediate step in reasoning

to guilt. Often, as here, the circumstantial evidence pointing to guilt

is the evidence to be used to rebut the alibi defence.

In Killick v. The Queen [1981] HCA 63, Gibbs C.J., Murphy, and Aickin

JJ. in the High Court of Australia held that once a plea of alibi is raised,

it is the prosecutions responsibility to disprove it.

Although an alibi is not uncommonly referred to as a defence, no

onus of proving an alibi rests on the accused; the prosecution must

negative an alibi if one is put forward as it must negative a claim

that the accused acted in self-defence or as a result of provocation:

see Reg v. Johnson (1961) 46 Cr App R 55; Reg v. Taylor [1968] NZLR

981 at pp 985-986.

The requirement for the prosecution to negate the alibi was upheld by the

Court of Appeal in the UK in R v. Hayward [2000] EWCA Crim 32, where

Henry L.J. stated:

We deal first with the criticism that no direction on the burden of

proof specific to the alibi was given. The Notes to the Alibi Direction

urge the judge to be sure to spell out that the Prosecution must

disprove the alibi, even in a short summing-up, in addition to giving

the general direction on the burden of proof. That undoubtedly

24

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

reflects good practice. But in the case of R v. Wood [1967] 52 Cr App

R 74, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that:

It is a rule of law that when an alibi is raised a particular direction

should be given to the jury in regard to the burden of proof, and that

in every case when an alibi is raised the judge should tell the jury,

quite apart from the general direction of the burden and standard of

proof, that it is for the Prosecution to negative the alibi.

Henry L.J. in R v. Oluyomi Ogundipe [2001] EWCA Crim 2576 also stated

that the onus of disproving the alibi remained with the prosecution.

With regard to the proof of alibi, the law can be summarized as follows:

Under section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance, the prosecution has the

overall burden of proving the charge against the accused and must do so

beyond a reasonable doubt. Under section 103 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the burden of proving an alibi falls on the accused. However,

the burden shifts to the accused only after the prosecution has

established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. If the evidence presented

by the accused creates a reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the

scene of the crime, the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt

and, consequently, to an acquittal, for the overall burden of proof remains

on the prosecution. In this process, the Court must evaluate the evidence

from both parties holistically to reach the correct conclusion.

Belated alibi

In any democratic criminal justice system, there is an inherent tension

between the public interest in prosecuting offenders and the duty to

ensure a fair trial to the accused. The administration of justice is not a

one-way street. It is often said that it is better to let ten guilty persons go

unpunished than to convict one innocent. Conversely, releasing actual

offenders amounts to punishing the innocent. The Supreme Court of

25

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

India in Sadhanantham v. Arunanchanalam (AIR 1980 SC 856) observed

that justice is functionally outraged not only when an innocent person is

punished but also when a guilty criminal gets away with it stultifying the

legal system.

Sri Lankan jurisprudence consistently rejects belated alibi pleas that are

not raised in a timely manner. In the Supreme Court case of

Vishawanadan v. Attorney General [2021] 1 Sri LR 14, De Abrew J. stated

that if the accused takes up a plea of alibi, he shall put it to the

prosecution witnesses during cross-examination. If the plea of alibi is

presented for the first time in the dock statement, the Court can reject it

as false. In Gunasiri v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 Sri LR 39 at 46, De

Abrew J. held that the failure to suggest the defence of alibi to the

prosecution witnesses who implicated the accused implies that the plea

is a false one. In the case of The Republic of Sri Lanka v. Marsook alias

Chutta (CA/HCC/2/2019, CA Minutes of 08.12.2022), Kaluarachchi J.

at page 6 took the view that the failure to suggest the defence of alibi to

the prosecution witnesses provides a strong basis for rejecting the alibi.

The importance of furnishing the details regarding the alibi at the first

opportunity was highlighted by Tilakawardane J. in Silva v. Silva [2002]

2 Sri LR 29 at 33:

The plaintiff-appellant who gave evidence at the trial in the District

Court, denied his presence at the scene of the alleged incident and

stated that at the relevant time he was at the house of his brother

which was situated some considerable distance away. He averred

that the defendant knowing this had falsely implicated him

deliberately and maliciously. The learned District Judge had rejected

this submission. Several reasons have been cited. He had failed to

set up this alibi promptly and it was therefore belated. In his

statement given to the Balapitiya Police on 24. 09. 1984 (P15),

26

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

though he denied being at home at the time of the incident, he never

made mention of the fact that he was at the relevant time at his

brothers house. Therefore, in the absence of these facts being

furnished to the Police, no contemporaneous statement of his brother

was recorded. The statement to the Balapitiya Police was the first

available opportunity given to the plaintiff to record his alibi, and he

had failed to do so. Even at the trial though his brother was a listed

witness he was not called to give evidence. Instead, he called his

father who did not even mention his alibi in his examination in chief,

despite referring to the Magistrates Court case. He only adverted to

it under cross-examination. The evidence of the father is pertinent in

that whilst he corroborated the case of the prosecution that an

incident did occur on the date as alleged by them, his testimony was

only that his son the plaintiff was not involved. He does not

corroborate the alibi, that his son the plaintiff was at his brothers

house during the relevant time. In all the circumstances there

appeared clearly a basis for the rejection of the evidence pertaining

to alibi by the District Judge.

False alibi

The fabrication of alibi evidence is relatively easy. Due to the potential for

such evidence being contrived, it necessitates meticulous scrutiny. The

complexities of the alibi defence were explored in R v. Cleghorn [1995] 3

SCR 175 at 188-189, where Major J. in the Supreme Court of Canada

referred to R.N. Goodersons work, Alibi (London: Heinemann

Educational Books Ltd., 1977) at pages 29-30:

[T]here is good reason to look at alibi evidence with care. It is a

defence entirely divorced from the main factual issue surrounding

the corpus delicti, as it rests upon extraneous facts, not arising from

the res gestae. The essential facts of the alleged crime may well be

27

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

to a large extent incontrovertible, leaving but limited room for

manoeuvre whether the defendant be innocent or guilty. Alibi

evidence, by its very nature, takes the focus right away from the

area of the main facts, and gives the defence a fresh and

untrammelled start. It is easy to prepare perjured evidence to

support it in advance.

The potential for the fabrication of alibi evidence requires that a

negative inference may be drawn against such evidence where the

alibi defence is not disclosed in sufficient time to permit

investigation.

A false alibi strengthens the prosecution case, as it suggests that the

accused has lied to escape conviction. A deliberately concocted or

fabricated alibi substantiated by independent evidence provides potential

evidence of the accuseds guilt. The Judge may only use the fabrication

of an alibi against the accused if there is evidence proving that it was

deliberately fabricated to deceive, rather than arising from mistake or

negligence.

An alibi that is merely disbelieved or rejected cannot serve to corroborate

or complement the prosecution case but something more is necessary.

As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v. Hibbert [2002] 2 SCR

445 at paras 6263:

Even if an alibi is advanced by the accused himself and is rejected,

the finding that the alibi is untrue cannot serve to corroborate or

complement the case for the prosecution, let alone permit an

inference that the accused is guilty.

If the alibi witnesses were found to be deliberately untruthful, their

attempt at deceiving the jury could not be visited upon the accused

unless he or she participated in the deceit. If, on the other hand,

28

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

there was evidence that the accused attempted to put forward a

fabricated defence, that effort, akin to an effort to bribe or threaten

a witness or a juror, could be tendered as evidence of consciousness

of guilt.

The Supreme Court of Canada in R v. Trochym [2007] 1 SCR 239 at para

172 and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. OConnor [2002] 62 OR

(3d) 263 reached similar conclusions.

In Tshiki v. The State [2020] ZASCA 92 the Supreme Court of Appeal of

South Africa at para 34 stated that where an alibi is presented and it

contradicts evidence presented before the court, and the alibi later turns

out to be a lie (or falsehood), the lie together with the other evidence of the

accused as a whole may point towards his or her guilt in certain cases.

Nevertheless, a false alibi in itself will not decide the case. Its significance

depends on the overall nature of the case. In Dearman v. Dearman [1908]

HCA 84, Griffith C.J. for the High Court of Australia did not think that

evidence to set up a false alibi should have been admitted in proof of

adultery in divorce proceedings.

There was another point in the case, that the respondent and co-

respondent had endeavoured to prove a false alibi. I may remark

that the whole of the evidence given on that point was in my opinion

inadmissible. The learned Judge very properly pointed out that even

innocent persons who have foolishly placed themselves in a

compromising position may endeavour to establish a false alibi,

though if that defence fails it may seriously injure their case, being

sometimes sufficient to turn the scale against them in a doubtful

case, and convert what would otherwise have been insufficient into

sufficient evidence of guilt.

29

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

Innocent people sometimes tell lies due to various reasons, not

necessarily in fear of guilt. In R v. Middleton [2001] Cr LR 251, Judge L.J.

observed:

People do not always tell the truth. Laudable as it may be to do so,

whatever the circumstances, they do not, or cannot, always bring

themselves to face up to reality. Innocent people sometimes tell lies

even when by doing so they create or reinforce the suspicion of guilt.

In short, therefore, while lying is often resorted to by the guilty to

hide and conceal the truth, the innocent can sometimes misguidedly

react to a problem, or postpone facing up to it, or attempt to deflect

ill-founded suspicion, or fortify their defence by telling lies.

The Lucas principle established in the landmark case of R v. Lucas [1981]

QB 720 provides that lies told by an accused both in and out of Court

may be treated as corroborative evidence indicative of the accuseds guilt,

subject to certain safeguards. Accordingly, for a lie to be considered

corroborative, (a) it must be unequivocally proven to be false, either by

admission or through independent evidence. Moreover, (b) the lie must

be deliberate, (c) relate to a material issue in the case, and (d) stem from

the realization of guilt, not for any other reason. This principle ensures

that not every falsehood told by the accused automatically leads to an

inference of guilt, and it must be carefully assessed in the context of the

case.

Lord Lane C.J. at 724 explained this as follows:

To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court

must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material

issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and

a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded

that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a

30

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful

behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly

shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who

is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from

an independent witness.

As a matter of good sense it is difficult to see why, subject to the

same safeguards, lies proved to have been told in court by a

defendant should not equally be capable of providing corroboration.

In other common law jurisdictions they are so treated.

Presumption of innocence

The accused need not prove his innocence. The prosecution shall prove

his guilt. His innocence is presumed and guaranteed under Article 13(5)

of the Constitution as a fundamental right, subject to the condition that

the burden of proving particular facts may, by law, be placed on an

accused person. This framework aims to secure a fair trial, which itself

is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 13(3) of the Constitution.

This protection is vital in a democratic society that upholds the values of

human dignity, freedom and equality.

In S v. Sithole and Others 1999 (1) SACR 585 (W) at 590 the test

applicable to criminal trials was explained as follows:

There is only one test in a criminal case, and that is whether the

evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable

doubt. The corollary is that an accused is entitled to be acquitted if

there is a reasonable possibility that an innocent explanation which

he has proffered might be true. These are not two independent tests,

but rather the statement of one test, viewed from two perspectives.

In order to convict, there must be no reasonable doubt that the

evidence implicating the accused is true, which can only be so if

31

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

there is at the same time no reasonable possibility that the evidence

exculpating him is true. The two conclusions go hand in hand, each

one being the corollary of the other. Thus in order for there to be a

reasonable possibility that an innocent explanation which has been

proffered by the accused might be true, there must at the same time

be a reasonable possibility that the evidence which implicates him

might be false or mistaken.

In Gunapala v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1994] 3 Sri LR 180 at 184, it

was held that the Court cannot refuse to consider a plea of alibi on the

basis that the evidence of the accused on alibi was not corroborated by

other evidence.

In Lionel alias Hitchikolla v. The Attorney General [1988] 1 Sri LR 4, G.P.S.

De Silva J. (as he then was) stated at page 8:

An alibi may broadly be described as a plea of an accused person

that he was elsewhere at the time of the alleged criminal act. What

is important for present purposes and what needs to be stressed is

that it is a plea which casts doubt on an essential element of the

case for the prosecution, namely that it was the 1st appellant who

committed the criminal act charged. In other words, if the jury

entertained a reasonable doubt in regard to a constituent element of

the offence, namely the criminal act (factum) then the 1st appellant

is entitled to an acquittal.

An alibi cannot be rejected on the ground that the prosecution has led

cogent and compelling evidence. The Supreme Court of Appeal of South

Africa in S v. Liebenberg 2005 (2) SACR 355 at para 14 stated:

Once the trial court accepted that the alibi evidence could not be

rejected as false, it was not entitled to reject it on the basis that the

prosecution had placed before it strong evidence linking the

32

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

appellant to the offences. The acceptance of the prosecutions

evidence could not, by itself alone, be a sufficient basis for rejecting

the alibi evidence. Something more was required. The evidence must

have been, when considered in its totality, of the nature that proved

the alibi evidence to be false.

When the accused sets up a defence of alibi, J.A.N. De Silva C.J. in

Jayatissa v. Attorney General [2010] 1 Sri LR 279 at 283 suggested three

postulates:

(i) if the evidence is not believed the alibi fails

(ii) if the evidence is believed the alibi succeeds

(iii) if the alibi evidence is neither believed nor disbelieved but would

create a reasonable doubt the accused should get the benefit of the

doubt.

In Ranasinghe v. O.I.C, Warakapola Police Station (SC/APPEAL/39/2011,

SC Minutes of 02.04.2014), Dep J. (as he then was) articulated the same

at pages 4-5 as follows:

(i) if the alibi is true the accused is entitled to an acquittal

(ii) it is probably true or probably untrue it raises a reasonable doubt

in the prosecution case and the accused is entitled to an acquittal

(iii) even if the alibi is rejected, the prosecution has to establish its case

beyond reasonable doubt.

These general principles have been examined and applied in numerous

cases, forming a significant body of case law, including Banda and Others

v. Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri LR 168 at 170-171, Premasiri v. The

Republic of Sri Lanka [2012] 1 Sri LR 43 at 49-50, Fernando v. The State

[2011] 1 Sri LR 382 at 388-389, Samantha v. Attorney General [2019] 2

Sri LR 24 at 33-34.

SC/APPEAL/61/2023

Conclusion

In this case, the rejection of the belated defence of alibi, introduced for

the first time during the accuseds evidence, is correct.

I answer the two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted

in the negative.

In addition to the suspended jail sentence and the fine, the Magistrates

Court ordered the accused to pay a sum of Rs. 40,000 as compensation

to the injured person. While dismissing the appeal, the High Court

imposed an additional sum of Rs. 40,000 as state costs. Given the facts

and circumstances of the case, particularly the conduct of the injured

person just prior to the incident, which resulted in the injured person

being convicted, I quash the order for state costs imposed by the High

Court. Subject to that variation, the appeal is dismissed.
