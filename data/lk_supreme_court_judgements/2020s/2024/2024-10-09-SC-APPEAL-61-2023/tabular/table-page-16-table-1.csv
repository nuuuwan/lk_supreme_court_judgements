"the accused, who adopts the plea of alibi to prove it with absolute"
"certainty so as to exclude the possibility of his presence at the place"
"of  occurrence.  When  the  presence  of  the  accused  at  the  scene  of"
"occurrence  has  been  established  satisfactorily  by  the  prosecution"
"through  reliable  evidence,  normally  the  court  would  be  slow  to"
"believe  any  counter  evidence  to  the  effect  that  he  was  elsewhere"
"when the occurrence happened. But if the evidence adduced by the"
"accused is of such a quality and of such a standard that the court"
"may entertain some reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the"
"scene when the occurrence took place, the accused would, no doubt,"
"be entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt. For that purpose,"
"it  would  be  a  sound  proposition  to  be  laid  down  that  in  such"
"circumstances, the burden on the accused is rather heavy. It follows,"
"therefore,  that  strict  proof  is  required  for  establishing  the  plea  of"
"alibi.  This  Court  has  observed  so  on  earlier  occasions  (vide  Dudh"
"Nath  Pandey v. State of Utter Pradesh (1981) 2 SCC 166; state of"
"Maharashtra v. Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple AIR 1984 SC 63)."
