"(b) Did the learned High Court Judge erroneously conclude that the"
"accused committed the offence despite insufficient evidence?"
"Insufficient evidence"
"The question (b) above is primarily based on identification. There are no"
"other eye-witnesses who saw the accused assaulting the injured person."
"The  injured  person  identified  the  accused  as  his  assailant.  He  was"
"assaulted with an object, which he thinks was an iron rod, resulting in"
"grievous injury to his right hand. The Medico-Legal Report supports this"
"version. Since he is the son of his brother, there could not have been a"
"difficulty in identification although the incident took place around 7.00"

"There was a motive behind this assault. On the same day, prior to the"
"incident  in  question,  the  injured  person,  while  under  the  influence  of"
"alcohol,  had  committed  house  trespass  and  attempted  to  stab  the"
"accused’s father with a knife. The evidence of the accused’s parents in"
"the instant case was that, during that incident, the accused’s father who"
"is visually impaired (a blind person) had defended himself by striking the"
"injured person with his walking stick. This has not been believed by the"
"learned Magistrate.  It is improbable that a grievous injury, such as an"
"open fracture of the distal humerus above the elbow joint of the right arm"
"as described in the Medico-Legal Report, could have been inflicted by a"
"walking  stick,  particularly  by  a  person  who  is  visually  impaired.  In"
"relation  to  the  previous  incident,  the  police  had  filed  a  separate  case,"
"which  resulted  in  the  conviction  of  the  injured  person  in  this  case.  He"
