"of the accused, the prosecution would fail and the accused would be"
"entitled to benefit of that reasonable doubt which would emerge in"
"the mind of the Court."
"The  same  view  was  expressed  by  Dias  J.  in  the  oft-quoted  case  of  The"
"King v. Marshall (1948) 51 NLR 157 at 159:"
"An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability like a plea of private"

"than  an  evidentiary  fact,  which  like  other  facts  relied  on  by  an"
"accused  must  be  weighed  in  the  scale  against  the  case  for  the"

"Jury  as  to  whether  he  was  present  at  the  scene  at  the  time  the"
"offence was committed, then the prosecution has not established its"
"case beyond all reasonable doubt, and the accused is entitled to be"

"the accused bears no burden of proving an alibi. However, in practical"
"terms, if the accused, through the defence of alibi, creates a reasonable"
"doubt about the prosecution case, it is considered that the accused has"
"discharged this burden."
"At this stage, it may not be inappropriate to clarify the meaning of proof"
