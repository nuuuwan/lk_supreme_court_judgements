"place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time"
"of the alleged commission."
"In  terms  of  section  126A(1)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  no"
"person on trial in the High Court may raise the defence of alibi unless he"
"had  raised  it  during  the  investigation,  providing  all  relevant  details  in"
"support of the alibi, or has notified the Attorney General at least 14 days"
"prior to the trial. The legislature now places an onus on the accused to"
"give  prior  notice  of  the  defence  of  alibi.  If  the  accused  fails  to  do  so,  it"
"does  not  merely  weaken  the  alibi  but  renders  it  inadmissible.  This"
"principle should apply not only to trials before the High Court but also to"
"those before the Magistrateâ€™s Court."
"In  terms  of  section  126A(2)  and  (3),  a  mere  statement  by  the  accused"
"claiming that he was not present at the scene of the offence is insufficient."
"The disclosure of an alibi should be given with sufficient particularity to"
"enable the police to meaningfully investigate the defence of alibi. Hence,"
"such disclosure of an alibi must not only state that the accused was not"
"present  at  the  location  of  the  crime  when  it  was  committed,  but  also"
"specify  where  he  was  at  that  time,  and  the  names  of  any  witnesses"
"supporting the alibi. Section 6A(2) and (3) of the UK Criminal Procedure"
"and  Investigations  Act  1996,  which  cover  the  same,  are  couched  in"
"stronger terms."
"However,  according  to  the  proviso  to  section  126A(1),  the  Court  may"
"permit the defence of alibi to be raised later, but before the conclusion of"
"the prosecution case, if sufficient and satisfactory reasons for the delay"
"are  provided.  In  this  regard,  the  Court  should  exercise  its  discretion"
