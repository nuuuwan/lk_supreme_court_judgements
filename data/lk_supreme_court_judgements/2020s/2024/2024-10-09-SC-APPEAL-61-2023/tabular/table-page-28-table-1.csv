"a witness or a juror, could be tendered as evidence of consciousness"
"of guilt."
"The Supreme Court of Canada in R v. Trochym [2007] 1 SCR 239 at para"
"172 and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. O’Connor [2002] 62 OR"
"(3d) 263 reached similar conclusions."
"In Tshiki v. The State [2020] ZASCA 92 the Supreme Court of Appeal of"
"South  Africa  at  para  34  stated  that  “where an alibi is presented and it"
"contradicts evidence presented before the court, and the alibi later turns"
"out to be a lie (or falsehood), the lie together with the other evidence of the"
"accused as a whole may point towards his or her guilt in certain cases.”"
"Nevertheless, a false alibi in itself will not decide the case. Its significance"
"depends on the overall nature of the case. In Dearman v. Dearman [1908]"
"HCA 84, Griffith C.J. for the High Court of Australia did not think that"
"evidence  to  set  up  a  false  alibi  should  have  been  admitted  in  proof  of"
"adultery in divorce proceedings."
