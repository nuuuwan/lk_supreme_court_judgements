"necessarily in fear of guilt. In R v. Middleton [2001] Cr LR 251, Judge L.J."
"observed:"
"People do not always tell the truth. Laudable as it may be to do so,"
"whatever  the  circumstances,  they  do  not,  or  cannot,  always  bring"
"themselves to face up to reality. Innocent people sometimes tell lies"
"even when by doing so they create or reinforce the suspicion of guilt."
"In  short,  therefore,  while  lying  is  often  resorted  to  by  the  guilty  to"
"hide and conceal the truth, the innocent can sometimes misguidedly"
"react to a problem, or postpone facing up to it, or attempt to deflect"
"ill-founded suspicion, or fortify their defence by telling lies."
