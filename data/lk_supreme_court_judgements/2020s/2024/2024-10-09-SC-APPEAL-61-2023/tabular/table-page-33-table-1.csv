"33"
"Conclusion"
"In this case, the rejection of the belated defence of alibi, introduced for"
"the first time during the accused’s evidence, is correct."
"I answer the two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted"
"in the negative."
"In addition to the suspended jail sentence and the fine, the Magistrate’s"
"Court ordered the accused to pay a sum of Rs. 40,000 as compensation"
"to  the  injured  person.  While  dismissing  the  appeal,  the  High  Court"
"imposed an additional sum of Rs. 40,000 as state costs. Given the facts"
"and  circumstances  of  the  case,  particularly  the  conduct  of  the  injured"
"person  just  prior  to  the  incident,  which  resulted  in  the  injured  person"
"being convicted, I quash the order for  state  costs imposed by the High"
"Court. Subject to that variation, the appeal is dismissed."
