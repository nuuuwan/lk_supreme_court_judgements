"reflects good practice. But in the case of R v. Wood [1967] 52 Cr App"
"R 74, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that:"
"“It is a rule of law that when an alibi is raised a particular direction"
"should be given to the jury in regard to the burden of proof, and that"
"in every case when an alibi is raised the judge should tell the jury,"
"quite apart from the general direction of the burden and standard of"
"proof, that it is for the Prosecution to negative the alibi.”"
