"In support of the above submission, the learned counsel cited Chitty on Contracts, 27th edition,"
"Volume 1 at page 94, which states;"
"“A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called"
"an invitation to treat it is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that"
"it is not made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as the person"
"to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms. A statement is"
"clearly not an offer if it expressly provides that the person who makes it is not be"
"bound merely by the other party’s notification of assent but only when he himself"
"has signed the document in which the statement is contained.”"
