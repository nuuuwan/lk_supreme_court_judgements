"referred to as the “1st appellant”), who was a minor at that time. The appellant stated that in terms"
"of  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  advertisement  published  on  the  12th  of  July,  1981,  the  1st"
"appellant  was entitled receive  a sum  of Rs. 351,  519/- after 21  years  from  the date of the said"
"deposit."
"Upon the 1st appellant reaching 21 years of age on the 17th of July, 2002 she had requested the"
"respondent-bank  to  remit  the  said  sum  of  Rs.  351,  519/-  to  her  account  maintained  at  the"
"Piliyandala Branch of the respondent bank. Responding to the said letter, the said bank by its letter"
"dated 18th of September, 2002 had informed the 1st appellant that she is only entitled for a sum of"
"Rs. 72, 244.96/-. However, the appellants stated that they were not informed of any conditions"
"regarding the variations of the interest rate and expected to receive the fixed benefits set out in the"
"said  advertisement.  Hence,  the  appellants  have  insisted  that  they  be  paid  the  amount  agreed"
"between the parties which is Rs. 351, 519/-."
"As the respondent-bank failed to pay a sum of Rs. 351, 519/-, the appellants instituted action in"
"the District Court of Moratuwa seeking to recover the said sum. Thereafter, the respondent bank"
"filed its answer stating that the said advertisement was an invitation to treat and not an offer and"
"sought for a dismissal of the plaint."
"After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge, by his judgment dated 3rd of June, 2005"
"granted  the  reliefs  prayed  for  in  the  prayer  to  the  plaint  on  the  basis  that  the  said  newspaper"
"advertisement  and  the  Certificate  of  Deposit  marked  ‘P2’  constitutes  a  contract  binding  on  the"
"parties."
"Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned District Judge, the respondent-bank appealed"
"to the Civil Appellant High Court of the Western Province of Mount Lavinia (hereinafter referred"
"to as the “High Court”) to have the said judgment set aside."
"After hearing the submissions of the parties, the High Court delivered its judgment dated 13th of"
"June,  2011  setting  aside  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court  on  the  basis  that  the  newspaper"
"advertisement produced marked as ‘P1’ is only an advertisement inviting the public to make offers"
"and thus, it cannot constitute a contract between the parties."
"Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants sought leave to appeal from"
"this court and the court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law;"
