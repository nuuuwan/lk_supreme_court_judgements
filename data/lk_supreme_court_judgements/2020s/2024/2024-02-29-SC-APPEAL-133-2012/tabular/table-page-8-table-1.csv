"Does the advertisement marked ‘P1’ constitute an offer or an invitation to treat?"
"Generally, advertisements are considered as invitations to treat as it is considered that an effective"
"offer cannot be made to the public at large."
"In Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 2 EAR 421 at 424, Lord Parker C.J. held;"
"“I  say  “with  less  reluctance”  because  I  think  that  when  one  is  dealing  with"
"advertisements and circulars, unless they indeed come from manufacturers, there"
"is business sense in their being construed as invitations to treat and not offers for"
"sale.”"
"However,  an  advertisement  would  be  considered  as  an  offer  where  one  party  makes  it  clear"
"expressly or impliedly that he is prepared to be bound by the said advertisement as soon as the"
"offer is accepted by a person. A similar view was observed in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball [1892]"
"2 QB 256 where Bowen L.J. held;"
"“It is an offer to become liable to anyone who, before it is retracted, performs the"
"condition, and, although the offer is made to the world, the contract is made with"
"that limited portion of the public who come forward and perform the condition on"
"the faith of the advertisement.”"
"Thus, an offer could be made to the public at large and such offers are known as unilateral offers."
"Further, such offers can be accepted by performing the conditions set out in the advertisement."
"Hence,  in  order  to  consider  whether  an  advertisement  is  an  offer  or  an  invitation  to  treat,  the"
"wording  of  the  advertisement  should  be  considered  to  ascertain  whether  it  contains  an  offer"
"intended  to  be  legally  bound  when  anyone  accepts  it.  Moreover,  an  advertisement  would  be"
"considered as an offer where it contains all the terms that are required to formulate a contract."
"Further, once an advertisement is published in a newspaper to be read by the public, the wording"
"in  the  said  advertisement  should  be  read  in  its  plain  meaning,  as  the  public  would  read  and"
"understand it. In the circumstances, the court needs consider the said advertisement in the way an"
"ordinary person reading it would understand it."
