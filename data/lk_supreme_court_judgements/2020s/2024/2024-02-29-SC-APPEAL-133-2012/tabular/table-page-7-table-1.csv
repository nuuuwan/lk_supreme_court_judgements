"The learned counsel further submitted that the 2nd appellant’s evidence given at the trial shows that"
"the said newspaper advertisement was only an invitation to treat and not an offer. Further, the said"
"newspaper advertisement was not capable of being accepted as it was not an offer but an invitation"
"to treat. Thus, the actual offer was made by the 2nd appellant when he visited the Moratuwa branch"
"on the 17th of July, 1981 and signed the mandate marked and produced as ‘V1’, which was accepted"
"by  the  respondent-bank,  resulting  in  a  binding  contract  between  the  parties  on  the  terms  and"
"conditions set out in ‘V1’."
"The learned  counsel  contended that in  the instant  case, the respondent-bank did  not  convey  an"
"intention to be bound with a reader of its advertisement. On the contrary, it invited the reader to"
"obtain further details from the nearest branch of the respondent-bank with regard to the Savings"
"Scheme and to submit an application to the bank for its acceptance."
"Hence, it was submitted that the High Court was correct in law in setting aside the judgment of the"
"learned District Judge. Therefore, it was submitted that the instant appeal should be dismissed with"
"costs."
