However, the number or the date of such plan of the Surveyor General had not been revealed in the said report. As per the evidence of the said surveyor, after obtaining instructions from the Court, he had made the other Plan No.809 marked X at the trial. As per the report marked X1, the surveyor has not divulged in the said report the number of any previous plan that he used to identify the land or used in any superimposition done, but he has stated that he did a superimposition after surveying the land. However, during his evidence, the surveyor has marked a purported copy of a Plan No. pp4098 dated 10.01.1958 as P1. Though two signatures are placed at the bottom of the said copy without names and designations to indicate that it was prepared and examined by those two signatories, there is nothing on the document to show that it was prepared and examined by two authorized personnel of the Surveyor Generals Department or qualified persons for that purpose. On the other hand, there is nothing mentioned on the said document marked P1 to say that it is a certified copy of the Plan No. pp4098 or it was issued by the Surveyor Generals Department. The surveyor also had not stated in his evidence that he, being a qualified person, with permission prepared a tracing from the original plan available in the Surveyor Generals Department or took steps to get a certified copy or true tracing of the original Plan No. pp4098 from the Surveyor Generals Department or any Authority where the original was available. The Surveyor had not stated that he got this P1 verified as a true copy by any means. No witness from the Surveyor Generals Department was called to give evidence to establish that P1 was a true copy made to scale from the original available in that Department. Thus, if it is P1 that he used to superimpose and identify the corpus as stated in his evidence (as said before it was not so stated in his reports), there was no proof to say that it was a true acceptable copy of the Plan No. pp4098 made in accordance to the scale mentioned in the original plan and it was prepared by qualified persons for that purpose or otherwise got its veracity ascertained by any means. It is true that P1 was marked without any objections but it does not give any sanctity to the document more than what is stated on the document itself. The surveyor himself had admitted that Plan No.172A (marked Y) made by him is an incomplete one as he made it without doing any survey and what is more correct is Plan No. 809 marked X",

As per the evidence of the Plaintiff, the original owner of the land named Werrellahena of 1 acre and 13 perches in extent was one Adiliya and his rights have been devolved on his son Dina, and Dina has transferred his rights to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 10526 marked P2. It is only in this Deed marked P2 that there is a reference to the lot 2 of said Plan No.4098 is made to describe the land in dispute. As per the stance of the Plaintiff, up to Dina, devolution of title is shown by inheritance from father to son. No evidence was led to show that land owned and possessed by Adiliya and/or Dina were surveyed and identified according to a plan before executing Deed marked P2, especially according to a Plan No. pp4098. The Plaintiff described P1 as a plan he received through post from the Survey Generals Department on a request made by him through post since his grandfather said to him to obtain a plan in that manner to execute the Deed - vide pages 120 and 130 of the brief. Neither such request letter addressed to the Surveyor General nor any covering letter that accompanied the purported plan P1 had been tendered in evidence by the Plaintiff. Hence, the evidence led before the learned District Judge shows only that the Plaintiff and his predecessor in title used the purported copy of Plan No pp4098 marked as P1 to describe the land when executing deed marked P2 but there is no proof to show that P2 plan is a true, acceptable copy of a plan made by the Surveyor Generals Department under the given Plan No. pp4098. In fact, the Plaintiff himself, when cross-examined as to the legality of Plan marked P1, has stated that he does not know of its legality- vide page 119 of the brief.",

However, the police complaint made by the original Plaintiff marked V1 and P3 refer to an incident that took place in November 1983. Document marked V2 proves that a Section 66 application in terms of the Act no 44 of 1979 was instituted in 1983 in the Primary Court. The Primary Court proceedings marked V3 shows that parties agreed before the Primary Court to possess as they possess and to file a civil action to resolve the dispute. If the Plaintiff was evicted as per the Police complaint within the period of two months prior to the filing of that Primary Court application, he would have proceeded first to get an order from the Primary Court without settling the matter in that manner. On the other hand, the Surveyors report marked X1(report made for Plan No 809 marked X) clearly shows that the Defendant was in the possession of the surveyed land. In that backdrop, it is highly questionable why the learned District Judge disregarded the older Deeds, namely V4 and V5 of the Defendant which had been executed to transfer undivided shares of a land called Werellahena respectively described as a land of 8 lahas and 1acre and 13 perches in the said Deeds, especially when the Plaintiffs predecessors in title had no Deed establishing their sole ownership to the entire land in Plan No. pp4098 and where the Plaintiff has used an uncertified purported copy of the Plan No. pp4098 to indicate boundaries in the Deed marked P2 by which he got title from his predecessor in title. It is worthwhile to note that there was no evidence to show that Plaintiff or any of his predecessors in title got a survey done to show the land they owned before executing P2. While comparing boundaries the learned District Judge in his Judgment states that boundaries in V4 and V5 are contradictory and do not tally with the Plan marked X. These seems to be the reasons given by learned District Judge to reject the Defendants Deeds and claim. As plan marked X was super imposed using Plan P1 which cannot be accepted as a true copy, identification done using such plan in plan X cannot be accepted. On the other hand, even though there is a difference in describing boundaries in V4 and V5 as far as the north east south and west orientation is concerned, both said Deeds describe Ambagahamulahena, a land belongs to a company (in V4 a company named Carson), and Bulugahahena as boundaries to Werellahena. Even the land surveyed in X plan finds Ambagahamulahena and estate belongs to Janawasama as its boundaries. Due to the nationalization of lands, land that belongs to a company would have become a estate belongs to Janawasama.",

Thus, it is observed that the Court of Appeal correctly decided against one of the contentions of the Defendant before Court of Appeal which appears to be that without pleading declaration of title to the entirety of the corpus, the Plaintiff cannot plead title to part of it and pray to eject the Defendant without indicating the part so encroached in a schedule and the plaint is of a kind that could have been refused in terms of section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. However, as explained above, it is not an error in the Plaint that makes the Plaintiffs case a failure, but the unreliability and unacceptability of the copy of the Plan used to describe and identify the land and any alleged encroachment.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal, referring to the decision of Gunasekera V Punchimenike and Others (2002) 2 Sri L R 43 has indicated that superimposition done using photo copies are inaccurate. It appears that it was the Plaintiff in his evidence admitted it as a photocopy- vide page 119 of the brief. The document marked P1 that had been made in 1958 is available in the District Court brief and it appears to be a print made on a fabric sheet. Therefore, I doubt whether the Court of Appeal was correct when it identified P1 as a photo copy of the original Plan. However, the Court of Appeal was correct in stating that P1 was an unsigned and uncertified document as to the correctness of the document. As said before in this Judgment, two unnamed persons have signed it to say that it was prepared and examined by them. As mentioned before, whether they are qualified to make such a copy was also not established. As explained above, no one was summoned from the Surveyor Generals Department or any authority to prove that the existence of an original Plan No. pp 4098 and to say that P1 was a correct copy of that. Neither the Surveyor had stated in evidence that he got the correctness of P1 verified by perusing the original nor that he got a correct tracing or a copy from the original. Hence, P1 remains as a purported uncertified copy of a Plan No. pp4098 of which the existence was not established before Court. Thus, as explained above in this Judgment, Plaintiffs case must fail, since this affects the reliability of accepting the description of the land in the Plaint and in the amended Plaint as well as the identification of the land and its alleged encroachment. Thus, the setting aside of the District Court Judgment and allowing of the appeal made to it by the Court of Appeal is correct in law.",
