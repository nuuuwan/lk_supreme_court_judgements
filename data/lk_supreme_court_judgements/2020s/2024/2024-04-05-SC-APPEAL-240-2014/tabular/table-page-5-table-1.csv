"1.","Plan No. 172 A, dated 20.01.1987 marked Y at the trial,"
"2.","Plan No. 809, dated 02.11.1989 marked X at the trial."
"As per the evidence given by the said surveyor, though he visited the land, he did not survey",""
"the land before making Plan No. 172A and in his report made for the said plan has stated that",""
"he prepared the said plan using a plan of the Surveyor General. However, the number or the",""
"date of such plan of the Surveyor General had not been revealed in the said report. As per the",""
"evidence  of  the  said  surveyor,  after  obtaining  instructions  from  the  Court,  he  had  made  the",""

"used","in  any  superimposition  done,  but  he  has  stated  that  he  did  a  superimposition  after"
"surveying the land. However, during his evidence, the surveyor has marked a purported copy of",""
