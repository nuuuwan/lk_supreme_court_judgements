"“Notwithstanding that a party or person has failed to file a memorandum under the"
"provisions of this Section, and that there has been no appointment of a legal"
"representative to represent the estate of such deceased party or person, any judgment"
"or decree entered in the action or any order made, partition or sale effected or thing"
"done in the action shall be deemed to be valid and effective and in conformity with"
"the provisions of this Law and shall bind the legal heirs and representatives of such"
"deceased party or person.  Such failure to file a memorandum shall also not be a"
"ground for invalidating the proceedings in such action.”"
