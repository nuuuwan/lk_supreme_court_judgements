P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submission of the learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner,

the submission of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent and also the

submission of the learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondents.

Having considered the submissions, Court decided to grant Leave to Appeal in respect of the

questions of law set out in paragraphs 11 (h) and 11 (i) of the Petition dated 22-11-2022.

The said questions of law can be reproduced as follows:

Whether the High Court of Civil Appeal, erred by concluding that the Notice of Appeal

is defective simply because one of the Appellants named therein is deceased?

Can the appeal be maintained by the other appellants when the name of one Appellant,

who is deceased, has been mentioned in the caption of the Petition of Appeal and the

Notice of Appeal?

With the concurrence of the learned Counsel for all the parties, Court decided to hear and

determine the instant Appeal forthwith in terms of Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules.

Submissions of Counsel were heard and the argument was concluded.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment of the District Court, the 3rd Defendant of this case, together

with certain other Defendants (the 4th, 5th and 8th to 13th Defendants), have appealed to the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. When that Appeal came up before the Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeals, it was revealed that the 5th Defendant had passed away long prior to

the Judgment being delivered in the District Court and no steps had been taken to effect any

suitable substitution with regard to the death of the 5th Defendant. It was on that basis that

the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Defendants had taken up a preliminary objection

against the maintainability of that Appeal before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals.

Having considered the arguments, the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals by their Judgment dated 13-10-2022, had upheld the said preliminary objection and

proceeded to dismiss the Appeal of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th to 13th Defendants with costs.

We observe that the provision of law in this regard is clear in Section 81 (9) of the Partition

Act which is as follows;

[SC HC CA LA 351/2022] - Page 8 of 9

8

Notwithstanding that a party or person has failed to file a memorandum under the

provisions of this Section, and that there has been no appointment of a legal

representative to represent the estate of such deceased party or person, any judgment

or decree entered in the action or any order made, partition or sale effected or thing

done in the action shall be deemed to be valid and effective and in conformity with

the provisions of this Law and shall bind the legal heirs and representatives of such

deceased party or person. Such failure to file a memorandum shall also not be a

ground for invalidating the proceedings in such action.

Thus, a person who has failed to file a memorandum under the provisions of this Section is

also bound by any Judgment or order made by Court in such circumstances.

We also observe that Section 759 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code has empowered the Appellate

Court to grant relief to the party in such situation where the Respondent has not been

materially prejudiced. The said provision of law is as follows:

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any appellant in

complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections, the Court of Appeal may, if it

should be of opinion that the respondent has not been materially prejudiced, grant

relief on such terms as it may deem just.

The learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant and the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff were not

able to counter this argument with any acceptable provision of law. This is because the above

provision of law is clear in its meaning, requiring no more clarifications. In these

circumstances, we proceed to answer the questions of law in respect of which we have granted

Leave to Appeal as follows:

The High Court of Civil Appeal has erred in dismissing the Petition of Appeal of the 3rd, 4th, 5th

and 8th to 13th Defendants as it had disregarded the provisions in Section 81 (9) of the Partition

Act and Section 759 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code in coming to the said conclusion.

In view of the above conclusion, I would not proceed to answer the second question of law

because answering the first question of law would be sufficient for the disposal of this Appeal.

In those circumstances, the dismissal of the aforesaid Appeal by the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals is not justifiable.

[SC HC CA LA 351/2022] - Page 9 of 9

For the aforesaid reasons, we proceed to set aside the order dated 13-10-2022, pronounced

by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. We direct the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals to proceed to fix this case for argument; thereafter consider the merits of the case

and then come to a final conclusion according to law.

The Registrar is directed to send the copy of this Judgment to the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals forthwith.
