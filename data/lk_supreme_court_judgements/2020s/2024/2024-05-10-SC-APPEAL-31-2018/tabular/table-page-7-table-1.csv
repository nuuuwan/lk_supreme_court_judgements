"cases."
"In  the  present  case,  the  plaintiff’s  financial  status  was  not  established"
"during 
the 
trial.  At 
the  commencement  of  evidence, 
the  plaintiff"
"mentioned  his  employment  as  an  Assistant  Store  Keeper  at 
the"
"Maganeguma  road  construction  company,  but  the  details  about  his"
"salary  and  expenses  were  not  led  by  either  party.  It  was  also  unclear"
"whether this employment was temporary. Before the marriage, he worked"
"as a tax collector on commission basis at the Pradeshiya Sabha, where"
"the  defendant  also  worked.  The  defendant  testified  that  during  the"
"marriage, she had to settle the plaintiff’s loans, purchase a motorbike for"
"him,  and  cover  household  expenses.  The  defendant  admits  that  the"
"plaintiff is not from a wealthy background. The defendant does not claim"
"that the plaintiff has any other movable or immovable properties, whether"
"inherited  or  purchased.  She  also  mentioned  that  the  plaintiff  paid"
"maintenance  for  a  child  from  a  previous  marriage  using  her  money.  It"
"seems  the  plaintiff  does  not  have  permanent  employment,  while  the"
"defendant’s  employment  is  permanent.  Following  the  registration,  the"
"plaintiff  waited  two  years  to  bring  the  defendant  to  their  matrimonial"
"home  due 
to 
financial  constraints.  They  did  not  have  a  separate"
"matrimonial  home.  The  matrimonial  home  was  the  plaintiff’s  parents’"
"home.  Constant  disputes  between  the  defendant  and  the  plaintiff’s"
"mother contributed to the breakdown of the marriage."
"In  short,  while  no  evidence  had  been  led  to  demonstrate  the  financial"
"states  of  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant,  through  her  evidence  and  during"
"the  cross-examination  of  the  plaintiff,  has  established  that  she  is  in  a"
"better financial position than the plaintiff.  The District Judge’s finding"
"that the defendant did not prove financial status of the plaintiff in order"
