"again  to  revive  the  same  order  wholly  or  in  part,  as  to  the  court"
"seems fit."
"Although the repealed section does not explicitly state that the wife must"
"be the innocent party to be entitled to alimony, Courts have interpreted"
"“the conduct of the parties” to mean that only the innocent party is entitled"
"to it. The term “The court may, if it thinks fit” found in section 615 also"
"lends support to come to that conclusion. As a result, alimony has been"
"denied when the wife is found to be the guilty party."
"Hence, in practical terms, the obligation to pay permanent alimony is tied"
"to the concept of matrimonial fault in divorce proceedings. In Sri Lanka,"
"under  section  19(2)  of  the  Marriage  Registration  Ordinance,  No.  19  of"
"1907,  as  amended,  a  decree  of  divorce  can  be  granted  on  proof  of"
"matrimonial fault identified in law, i.e. adultery, malicious desertion and"
"incurable impotency. What is known in some other jurisdictions as “no-"
"fault divorce” is not part of our law (Tennekoon v. Tennekoon [1986] 1 Sri"
"LR 90)."
"In awarding permanent alimony after the grant of divorce, the Court has"
"discretion. However, this discretion needs to be exercised judicially, not"
"arbitrarily, leaving aside the personal beliefs, biases and prejudices of the"
"Judge towards the marriage relationship, divorce, and alimony itself."
