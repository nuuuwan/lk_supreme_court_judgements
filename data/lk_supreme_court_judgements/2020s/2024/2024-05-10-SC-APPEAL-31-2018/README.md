Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff husband filed action seeking a decree of divorce (vinculo

matrimonii) on the ground of malicious desertion on the part of the

defendant wife. The defendant countersued for a divorce on constructive

malicious desertion on the part of the husband. She also prayed for a

sum of Rs. one million as permanent alimony. There are no children from

this union. After trial, the District Court granted the divorce in favour of

the defendant but did not award permanent alimony citing want of

evidence. The defendant appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal

against the denial of permanent alimony. The High Court did not interfere

with the judgment of the District Court and reiterated that there was no

evidence to award alimony. The defendant is before this Court against

the judgment of the High Court.

Learned counsel for the defendant cites section 615(1)(b) of the Civil

Procedure Code as the provision which empowers the District Court to

award alimony after granting the divorce.

Section 615 of the Civil Procedure Code as it stands now reads as follows:

615. (1) The court may, if it thinks fit, upon pronouncing a decree of

divorce or separation, order for the benefit of either spouse or of the

children of the marriage or of both, that the other spouse shall do

any one or more of the following:-

(a) make such conveyance or settlement as the court thinks

reasonable of such property or any part thereof as he may be

entitled to;

(b) pay a gross sum of money;

(c) pay annually or monthly such sums of money as the court

thinks reasonable;

4

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

(d) secure the payment of such sums of money as may be ordered

under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) by the hypothecation of

immovable property or by the execution of a bond with or

without sureties, or by the purchase of a policy of annuity in

an insurance company or other institution approved by court.

(2) The court may at any stage discharge, modify, temporarily

suspend and revive or enhance an order made under subsection.

In terms of section 615(1)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code, the Court may,

if it thinks fit, upon pronouncing a decree of divorce, order for the benefit

of either spouse that the other spouse shall pay a gross sum of money as

permanent alimony. The legislature has not expressly stated matrimonial

fault as a factor in awarding alimony. In terms of this section, alimony

can be awarded not only in favour of the wife, but also in favour the

husband. This is a clear departure from the earlier position where only

the wife could claim for alimony.

Section 615 as it stood before the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Law,

No. 20 of 1977, read as follows:

615. The court may, if it thinks fit, on any decree absolute declaring

a marriage to be dissolved, or on any decree of separation obtained

by the wife, order that the husband shall, to the satisfaction of the

court, secure to the wife such gross sum of money, or such annual

sum of money for any term not exceeding her own life, as, having

regard to her fortune (if any), to the ability of the husband, and to

the conduct of the parties, it thinks reasonable; and for that purpose

may cause a proper instrument to be executed by all necessary

parties.

5

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

(2) In every such case the court may make an order on the husband

for payment to the wife of such monthly or weekly sums for her

maintenance and support as the court may think reasonable:

Provided that if the husband afterwards from any cause becomes

unable to make such payments, it shall be lawful for the court to

discharge or modify the order, or temporarily to suspend the same

as to the whole or any part of the money so ordered to be paid, and

again to revive the same order wholly or in part, as to the court

seems fit.

Although the repealed section does not explicitly state that the wife must

be the innocent party to be entitled to alimony, Courts have interpreted

the conduct of the parties to mean that only the innocent party is entitled

to it. The term The court may, if it thinks fit found in section 615 also

lends support to come to that conclusion. As a result, alimony has been

denied when the wife is found to be the guilty party.

Hence, in practical terms, the obligation to pay permanent alimony is tied

to the concept of matrimonial fault in divorce proceedings. In Sri Lanka,

under section 19(2) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance, No. 19 of

1907, as amended, a decree of divorce can be granted on proof of

matrimonial fault identified in law, i.e. adultery, malicious desertion and

incurable impotency. What is known in some other jurisdictions as no-

fault divorce is not part of our law (Tennekoon v. Tennekoon [1986] 1 Sri

LR 90).

In awarding permanent alimony after the grant of divorce, the Court has

discretion. However, this discretion needs to be exercised judicially, not

arbitrarily, leaving aside the personal beliefs, biases and prejudices of the

Judge towards the marriage relationship, divorce, and alimony itself.

6

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

When permanent alimony is sought by the innocent spouse from the

guilty spouse, the Court needs to consider a variety of factors. The

decision regarding the quantum of alimony should depend on the unique

facts and circumstances of each individual case. A similar view was

expressed by me in respect of alimony pendente lite in Thamel v.

Nawaratne (SC/APPEAL/153/2019, SC Minutes of 28.02.2024).

With respect, I am unable to agree with the view expressed in the

judgment of the Court of Appeal in Anulawathie v. Gunapala and Another

[1998] 1 Sri LR 63 at 67 which states that the sole criterion upon which

alimony should be quantified is the financial status of the defendant.

Among all the factors, perhaps the most important is the financial status,

but not only the financial status of the guilty spouse but also of the

innocent spouse.

In addition to the existing financial status of the parties, the Court must

consider other factors such as their future earning capacity, the length

of the marriage, the reason or reasons for divorce, the standard of living

during the marriage, the ages and health of the parties, their station in

life or social standing, other financial liabilities, custody arrangements.

This is not an exhaustive list.

The underlying principle of ordering permanent alimony is to ensure

sufficient support for the former wife after the divorce. It need not be

intended to serve as punishment for the husband found guilty of

matrimonial fault. The order for alimony should be reasonable and

realistic.

It is important to note that although alimony ordered after divorce is

termed permanent alimony, it is not truly permanent. Section 615(2)

states that the Court may at any stage discharge, modify, temporarily

suspend, revive or enhance such an order. Therefore, judicial time need

7

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

not be unnecessarily spent on deciding the question of alimony in divorce

cases.

In the present case, the plaintiffs financial status was not established

during the trial. At the commencement of evidence, the plaintiff

mentioned his employment as an Assistant Store Keeper at the

Maganeguma road construction company, but the details about his

salary and expenses were not led by either party. It was also unclear

whether this employment was temporary. Before the marriage, he worked

as a tax collector on commission basis at the Pradeshiya Sabha, where

the defendant also worked. The defendant testified that during the

marriage, she had to settle the plaintiffs loans, purchase a motorbike for

him, and cover household expenses. The defendant admits that the

plaintiff is not from a wealthy background. The defendant does not claim

that the plaintiff has any other movable or immovable properties, whether

inherited or purchased. She also mentioned that the plaintiff paid

maintenance for a child from a previous marriage using her money. It

seems the plaintiff does not have permanent employment, while the

defendants employment is permanent. Following the registration, the

plaintiff waited two years to bring the defendant to their matrimonial

home due to financial constraints. They did not have a separate

matrimonial home. The matrimonial home was the plaintiffs parents

home. Constant disputes between the defendant and the plaintiffs

mother contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.

In short, while no evidence had been led to demonstrate the financial

states of the plaintiff, the defendant, through her evidence and during

the cross-examination of the plaintiff, has established that she is in a

better financial position than the plaintiff. The District Judges finding

that the defendant did not prove financial status of the plaintiff in order

8

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

for the Court to order permanent alimony is flawless. It is that order

which was affirmed by the High Court.

Although the repealed section 615 contained guidelines for the exercise

of discretion in awarding permanent alimony, the new section lacks any

such guidelines. Therefore, in the judgment, the High Court noted that

all the criteria identified in the UK Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 may

well be equally applicable to the exercise of judicial discretion in Sri

Lanka in order to ascertain the financial status and the need of both

parties to the action. Thereafter, the High Court examined each of these

criteria identified in the UK Matrimonial Causes Act in relation to the

facts of the case at hand and concluded that, since the defendant did not

satisfy those criteria, she was not entitled to permanent alimony.

Learned counsel for the defendant-appellant contends that this approach

of the High Court is incorrect and could set a bad precedent unless this

Court clarifies the correct legal position. It is encouraging to learn that

learned counsel is considering broader policy implications beyond the

isolated appeal of this case.

In terms of section 23(1)(c) of the UK Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973,

similar to the provisions in Sri Lanka, the Court, upon granting a divorce,

has the authority to order the payment of a lump sum. Furthermore,

section 25(1) of the Act requires the Court, in determining whether to

exercise its powers under this section, to consider all the circumstances

of the case. Additionally, section 25(2) specifies that the Court must

particularly consider the following factors:

(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial

resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely

to have in the foreseeable future, including in the case of earning

capacity any increase in that capacity which it would in the opinion

9

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

of the court be reasonable to expect a party to the marriage to take

steps to acquire;

(b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of

the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable

future;

(c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown

of the marriage;

(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the

marriage;

(e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the

marriage;

(f) the contributions which each of the parties has made or is likely in

the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family,

including any contribution by looking after the home or caring for

the family;

(g) the conduct of each of the parties, if that conduct is such that it

would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it;

(h) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the

value to each of the parties to the marriage of any benefit which,

by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage, that

party will lose the chance of acquiring.

I appreciate that the grounds of divorce, socio-economic culture, and

societal values etc. between the UK and Sri Lanka are incomparable, and

therefore we cannot mechanically adopt the criteria formulated for the

UK legal system without any modification. However, in exercising

discretion, it is not inappropriate for our Courts to consider those factors

also as guidelines but certainly not as a rigid checklist. Even under the

UK Matrimonial Causes Act, it is not an exhaustive list. The quantum of

alimonywhether as alimony pendente lite or as permanent alimony

10

SC/APPEAL/31/2018

should be decided not based on hard and fast rules but on the unique

facts and circumstances of each case.

It may be worth considering the adoption of certain standards to guide

the exercise of discretion, as this could enhance predictability and deter

arbitrariness. However, it is important to ensure that this does not

compromise the flexibility inherent in judicial discretion, which is

particularly valuable in the determination of alimony. The legislature has

declined to specify any criteria in section 615 of the Civil Procedure Code

so that this judicial discretion is preserved.

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted and the

answers thereto are as follows:

Q. Did the High Court misdirect itself in law when it applied criteria

in the UK Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 in assessing financial

status?

A. Applying the UK criteria as a rigid checklist for awarding alimony

in the Sri Lankan context is not feasible, but they can be used,

among other considerations, as guides to decide the quantum of

alimony.

Q. Did the High Court err both in fact and law when it failed to

appreciate that, considering all the circumstances of the case, the

defendant is entitled to have an order for permanent alimony?

A. No, considering all the circumstances of the case, the defendant is

not entitled to have an order for permanent alimony.

I agree with the judgment of the High Court on the question of alimony

subject to the views expressed in this judgment. The appeal is dismissed

but without costs.
