"Chancery or King’s Bench Division. I find in 1849 Wigram V.C. in the",""
"case of Castelli v. Cook (1849) 7 Hare 89 at 94 stating the rule in",""
"this  way:  “A  plaintiff  applying  ex  parte  comes  (as  it  has  been",""
"expressed) under the contract with the Court that he will state the",""
"whole case fully and fairly to the Court. If he fails to do that, and the",""
"Court finds, when the other party applies to dissolve the injunction,",""
"that any material fact has been suppressed or not properly brought",""
"forward,  the  plaintiff  is  told  that  the  Court  will  not  decide  on  the",""
"merits, and that, as he has broken faith with the Court, the injunction",""
"must go.” The same thing is said in the case to which the Master of",""
"the Rolls has referred of Dalglish v. Jarvie 2 Mac. & G. 231. A similar",""
"point arises in applications made ex parte to serve writs out of the",""
"jurisdiction,  and  I  find  in  the  case  of  Republic  of  Peru  v.  Dreyfus",""
"Brothers  &  Co.  55  L.T.  802  at  803.  Kay  J.  stating  the  law  in  this",""
"way: “I have always maintained, and I think it is most important to",""
"maintain most strictly, the rule that, in ex parte applications to this",""
"Court,  the  utmost  good  faith  must  be  observed.","If  there 
is  an"
"important misstatement, speaking for myself, I have never hesitated,",""
"and  never  shall  hesitate  until  the  rule  is  altered,  to  discharge  the",""
"order at once, so as to impress upon all persons who are suitors in",""
"this  Court  the  importance  of  dealing  in  good  faith  with  the  Court",""
"when  ex  parte  applications  are  made.”  A  similar  statement  in  a",""
"similar class of case is made by Farwell L.J. in the case of The Hagen",""
"[1908] P. 189 at 201: “Inasmuch as the application is made ex parte,",""
"full and fair disclosure is necessary, as in all ex parte applications,",""
"and a failure to make such full and fair disclosure would justify the",""
"Court","in  discharging  the  order,  even  although  the  party  might"
"afterwards be in a position to make another application.”",""
