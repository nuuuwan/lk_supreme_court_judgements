SC/FR/247/2016"
"of my house, including the boundary walls, the then Chairman of the 1st"
"respondent issued Certificate of Conformity” marked P5."
"According to the side minute under the journal entry dated 04.08.2016,"
"notices  of 
this  application  had  been 
issued  on  05.08.2016.  The"
"application  was  supported  and 
leave 
to  proceed  was  granted  on"
"10.08.2016 in the absence of the Pradeshiya Sabha."
"The position of the Pradeshiya Sabha is that the said boundary wall was"
"an  unauthorized  construction  built  without  any  approval 
from  the"
"Pradeshiya Sabha. I am inclined to accept this position. The petitioner"
"relies  solely  on  the seal  placed  on  the  building  plan  marked  P4  by  the"
"Pradeshiya Sabha to present a distorted case that the boundary wall was"
"constructed  with 
the  approval  of 
the  Pradeshiya  Sabha,  and 
that"
"following its construction, the Pradeshiya Sabha issued the Certificate of"
"Conformity.  P4  contains  only  the  building  plan  and  nothing  else.  No"
"proposed  boundary  wall  is  shown  on  P4  although  the  common  seal"
"placed 
on 
P4 
contains 
the  words 
“Mixed-Residential/Commercial"
"purposes/Buildings 
for  Security/Boundary  Walls/Survey  Plan”.  The"
"Pradeshiya  Sabha  has  not  deleted  the  irrelevant  words.  The  Chairman"
"has placed his signature on the building plan under the said words."
"This constitutes a misrepresentation or a distortion of material facts. If"
"this was drawn to the attention of the Court when the application was"
"supported  for  leave  to  proceed,  the  Court  could  have  taken  a  different"
"view, although the petitioner now states that, even if it is an unauthorized"
"construction, the Pradeshiya Sabha could not demolish the wall without"
"an  order  obtained 
from 
the  Magistrate’s  Court  under 
the  relevant"
"statutory provisions, i.e. in terms of section 28 of the Urban Development"
"Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978, and other relevant laws."
