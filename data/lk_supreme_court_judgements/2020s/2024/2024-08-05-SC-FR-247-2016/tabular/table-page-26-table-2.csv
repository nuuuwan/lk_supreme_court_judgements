"was  so  different  as  the  others  were  similarly  circumstanced  and  there"
"were no grounds to differentiate them from him."
"Our Constitution has clearly spelt out the concept of equality before"
"the law and there are numerous instances where that right had been"
"accepted and upheld. In the process this Court has also noted that"
"if  a  person  complains  of  unequal  treatment  the  burden  is  on  that"
"person to place before this Court material that is sufficient to infer"
"that unequal treatment had been meted out to him. Accordingly, it is"
"necessary for the petitioners not only to establish that they had been"
"treated differently from others, but also that such treatment was so"
"different as the others were similarly circumstanced and there were"
"no grounds to differentiate them from him."
