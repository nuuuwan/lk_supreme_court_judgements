"It 
is 
settled 
law 
that 
lack 
of 
suppression 
or 
uberrima 
fides,"
"misrepresentation of material facts, and the conduct of the petitioner are"
"relevant 
factors 
that 
the  Court  can  consider,  particularly 
in  writ"
"applications,  as  writ 
is  a  discretionary 
remedy.  This  principle 
is"
"frequently applied in injunctive reliefs as well. This judge-made rule now"
"hardened into law has been extended to fundamental rights applications"
"as well, since the Supreme Court in the exercise of the fundamental rights"
"jurisdiction  is  empowered  under  Article  126(4)  of  the  Constitution  to"
"grant relief or make directions that it deems “just and equitable” in the"
"circumstances  of 
the  case.  The  Supreme  Court 
in 
the  exercise  of"
"fundamental rights jurisdiction acts both as a court of law and a court of"
"equity, ensuring that justice is administered not only according to legal"
"rules but also in accordance with principles of equity. Any suppression"
"or misrepresentation of material facts by a petitioner in a fundamental"
"rights application entitles the Court to dismiss the application in limine"
"without going into the merits."
"The fact suppressed or misrepresented must be a material fact, not any"
"fact. In Fonseka v. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others [2011]"
"2 Sri LR 372, Justice Salam observed at page 410 that “Material facts are"
"those  which  are  material  for  the 
judge  to  know 
in  dealing  with  the"
"application as made; materiality is to be decided by court and not by the"
"assessment  of  the  applicant  or  his  legal  advisers”.  In  order  to  decide"
"whether a fact is material, the pertinent question to ask is whether the"
"decision of the Court would have been different had it been aware of the"
"fact suppressed or misrepresented. However, it is not necessary to prove"
"conclusively  that  the  decision  of  the  Court  would  definitely  have  been"
"different.  It  is  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that  the  fact  was  material  and"
"that its true disclosure could have influenced the decision of the Court."
