"inter alia, on the basis of lack of good faith on the part of the petitioner."
"Justice Yapa stated at 333-335:"
"There  is  another  serious  matter  that  has  been  observed  in  this"
"application namely, that the petitioner had withheld from Court the"
"contents of X2. The petitioner filed this application on 18.01.1999,"
"and it was supported and leave to proceed obtained on 26.01.1999."
"On  the  same  date,  counsel  for  the  petitioner  had  obtained  interim"
"relief by seeking a direction on the 1st and 2nd respondents to defer"
"the recall of the vehicle bearing No. 15-9892 until the final hearing"
"and determination of this application. It would appear therefore, that"
"the  petitioner  had  obtained  leave  to  proceed  and  interim  relief  by"
"suppressing the contents of X2, which very clearly stated that the"
"petitioner was not eligible to purchase the vehicle he was using in"
"terms of the circular P6. Under normal circumstances X2 would have"
"reached the 1st respondent by about 06.01.1999. The petitioner who"
"was anxiously waiting for the approval from the 3rd respondent to"
"purchase  the  vehicle  in  question  under  the  circular  would  have"
"known  the  decision  conveyed  by  the  3rd  respondent  to  the  1st"
"respondent by X2. Hence, the petitioner cannot be heard to say that"
"he had no knowledge of the contents of X2. Besides, the timing of"
"the petitioner’s application to this Court which was on 18.01.1999,"
"suggests that the petitioner had decided to file this application soon"
"after the 3rd respondent’s letter X2, which stated that the petitioner"
"was  not  eligible  to  purchase  the  vehicle  in  terms  of  the  circular.  It"
"should be mentioned here that, had the contents of X2 been made"
"known to the Court, it was very unlikely that the Court would have"
"given the interim relief that was granted to the petitioner. Therefore,"
"it would appear that the petitioner had been guilty of suppressing a"
"material fact from Court. In doing so, the petitioner had misled Court"
"and  obtained  an  interim  order  which  this  Court  would  not  have"
