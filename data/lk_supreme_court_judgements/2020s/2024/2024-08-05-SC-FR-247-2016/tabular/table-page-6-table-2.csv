"In  Fonseka  v.  Lt.  General  Jagath  Jayasuriya  and  Five  Others  (supra),"
"Justice Salam remarked at page 410:"
"A maxim known almost during the whole of last century and having"
"its origin in equity courts is that one must approach the court with"
"clean  hands.  The  maxim  has  been  so  indoctrinated  in  the  legal"
"system that almost all our courts, loath to entertain claims that are"
"tainted  with  non-disclosure  of  material  facts.  It  is  particularly  so"
"when the benefit of the maxim is invoked by the respondent or raised"
"by court ex mero motu."
