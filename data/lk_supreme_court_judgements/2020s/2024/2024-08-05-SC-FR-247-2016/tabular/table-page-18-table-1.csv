"need to disclose uberrima fides and disclose all material facts fully"
"and frankly to Court. Any party who misleads Court, misrepresents"
"facts  to  Court  or  utters  falsehood  in  Court  will  not  be  entitled  to"
"obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established proposition of law,"
"since Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank and open with"
"the Court. This principle has been applied even in an application that"
"has  been  made  to  challenge  a  decision  made  without  jurisdiction."
"Further,  Court  will  not  go 
into 
the  merits  of  the  case 
in  such"
"situations.  Vide  Rex  v.  Kensington 
Income  Tax  Commissioners;"
"Princess  Edmond  De  Polignac  Ex  Parte 
(1917)  1  KB  486.  This"
"principle of uberrima fides has been applied not only in writ cases"
"where  discretionary 
relief 
is  sought 
from  Court,  but  even 
in"
"Admiralty  cases  involving  the  grant  of  injunctions.  (â€¦.)  It  would"
"appear, therefore, that the petitioner in this application had wilfully"
"suppressed material facts from Court by withholding his own letter"
"1R8 dated 10.07.2000 and by non-disclosure of his application to"
"the Court of Appeal seeking identical relief."
