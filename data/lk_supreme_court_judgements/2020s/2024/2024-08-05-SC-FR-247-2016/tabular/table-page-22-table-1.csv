SC/FR/247/2016"
"Learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to argue that the Petitioners"
"have  suppressed  this  material  fact  from  this  Court  by  failing  to"
"attach Annexe I of the schedule sent to them and referred to in the"
"Petitioners’ documents marked P5B to P6. In my view, there is much"
"substance in the contention raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor"
"General.  It  is  well  settled  that  the  relief  under  Article  126  of  the"
"Constitution is just and equitable and the Petitioners who approach"
"this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of"
"facts. If the Petitioners fail to do so and suppress material facts, their"
"application  is  liable  to  be  dismissed  on  that  ground  alone.  (….)  I"
"therefore hold that failure to attach the Schedule in Annexe I to the"
"letters 
filed  by 
the  Petitioners  marked  P5B 
to  P6  amounts 
to"
"“suppression of a material fact” and the application of the Petitioners"
"is 
liable 
to  be  dismissed  without  proceeding 
further  with 
the"
"examination on the merits."
