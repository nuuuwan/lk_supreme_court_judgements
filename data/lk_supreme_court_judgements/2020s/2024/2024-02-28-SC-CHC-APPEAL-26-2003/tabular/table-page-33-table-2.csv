"[W]here it can be shown that all shareholders who have a right to"
"attend  and  vote  at  a  general  meeting  of  the  company  assent  to"
"some  matter  which  a  general  meeting  of  the  company  could  carry"
"into  effect,  that  assent  is  as  binding  as  a  resolution  in  general"
"meeting would be."
