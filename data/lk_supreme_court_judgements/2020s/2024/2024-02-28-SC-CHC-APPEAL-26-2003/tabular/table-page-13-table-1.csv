"Due to the infinite variability of circumstances in which oppression may"
"arise, it is inherently intricate to provide a precise legal definition to the"
"term  “oppression”.  The  determination  of  whether  oppression  exists"
"necessitates 
a 
case-by-case 
evaluation 
of 
the  unique 
facts 
and"
"circumstances. 
In  the  House  of  Lords  case  of  Scottish  Co-operative"
"[1958]  3  All  ER  66  at  71,  Lord 
Wholesale  Society  Limited  v.  Meyer"
"Simonds described the meaning of the term “oppression” in this context"
"as the majority exercising authority over the minority in a manner that"
"is “burdensome, harsh and wrongful”.  This definition was adopted in Re"
"H.R. Harmer Ltd [1958] 3 All ER 689 and in many other cases."
"Lord  Keith  in  Scottish  Co-operative  Wholesale  Society  Limited  (supra)"
