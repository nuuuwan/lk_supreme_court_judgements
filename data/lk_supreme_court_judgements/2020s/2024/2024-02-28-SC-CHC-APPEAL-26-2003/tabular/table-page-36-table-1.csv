"done  under  this  Act,  shall  have  effect  as  if  made,  passed,  given,"
"taken, issued, or done under the provisions of this Act."
"Was the agreement X11 in force when the new Companies Act of 2007"
"became  law?  In  my  judgment,  it  was  not.    The  petitioner  knew  this"
"when  he  filed  the  application  in  the  Commercial  High  Court  where  he"
"said in paragraph 17 of the petition:"
"The 
petitioner 
states 
that 
in 
any 
event, 
in 
terms 
of 
the"
"shareholders’  agreement marked X11 the 2nd and 3rd respondents"
"cannot take control of the 1st respondent company or its finances or"
"oust  the  petitioner  from  its  board  of  directors  or  the  post  of  Chief"
"Executive Officer without first referring the disputes to arbitration."
"However 
in  X18(e)  the  said  respondents  have  denied  they  are"
"bound  by  X11  and  therefore  the  petitioner  verily  believes  that  the"
"said respondents would not agree to proceed to arbitration."
"The petitioner acknowledges that the 2nd respondent denies X11 and he"
"(the  petitioner)  acquiesces  to  this  denial.    If  the  petitioner  considered"
"X11 a binding agreement, he could not have in the first place filed this"
"application in the Commercial High Court without referring the dispute"
"to arbitration. The petitioner cannot approbate and reprobate, blow hot"
"and cold."
"The position of the petitioner in his first written submissions that “The"
"2nd  and  3rd  respondents  however  attempt  to  distance  themselves  from"
"X11 stating that they were compelled to sign same. Whatever may be the"
"positions  of 
the  parties,  but 
the  X11 
remains  a  binding  and  valid"
"agreement 
in 
law  and  moreover  signing  of 
it  was  admitted  by 
the"
"respondents” is untenable."
