"","In  the  case  of  section  459  [of  the  UK  Companies  Act  of  1985],  the"
"","background has the following two features. First, a company is an"
"","association  of  persons  for  an  economic  purpose,  usually  entered"
"","into  with  legal  advice  and  some  degree  of  formality.  The  terms  of"
"","the  association  are  contained  in  the  articles  of  association  and"
"sometimes 
in  collateral  agreements  between","the  shareholders."
"","Thus  the  manner  in  which  the  affairs  of  the  company  may  be"
"","conducted  is  closely  regulated  by  rules  to  which  the  shareholders"
"","have  agreed.  Secondly,  company  law  has  developed  seamlessly"
"","from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity, like the"
"","Roman societas, as a contract of good faith. One of the  traditional"
"roles  of  equity,  as  a  separate","jurisdiction,  was  to  restrain  the"
"","exercise  of  strict  legal  rights  in  certain  relationships  in  which  it"
"considered 
that 
this  would  be  contrary","to  good 
faith.  These"
"","principles  have,  with  appropriate  modification,  been  carried  over"
"into company law.",""
