"company  (No  005685  of  1988),  ex  p  Schwarz  (No  2)  [1989]  BCLC  427"
"In general members of a  company have no legitimate expectations"
"going beyond the legal rights conferred on them by the constitution"
"of  the  company,  that  is  to  say  its  memorandum  and  articles  of"
"association.  Nonetheless,  legitimate  expectations  superimposed  on"
"a  memberâ€™s 
legal 
rights  may 
arise 
from 
agreements 
or"
"understandings  between 
the  members.  Where,  however, 
the"
"acquisition  of  shares 
in  a  company 
is  one  of  the  results  of  a"
"complex  set  of 
formal  written  agreements 
it 
is  a  question  of"
"construction of  those  agreements  whether  any such superimposed"
"legitimate expectations can arise."
