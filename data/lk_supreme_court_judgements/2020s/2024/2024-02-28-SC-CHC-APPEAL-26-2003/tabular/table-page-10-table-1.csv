    SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003"
"this submission is correct, for instance, the allegations levelled against"
"the  2nd  respondent  by  the  petitioner  in  X15(a)  in  relation  to  dealings"
"with  Natural  Power  (Pvt)  Ltd  are  meaningless.  What  is  the  purpose  of"
"the petitioner stating in X15(a) that he does not want to work with the"
"1st respondent company on future projects?"
"The petitioner states that after Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd rejected the offer"
"of the 2nd respondent and accepted that of the petitioner, the 2nd and 3rd"
"respondents  orchestrated  a  strategy 
to  suppress 
the  rights  of 
the"
"petitioner as a shareholder and director of the 1st respondent company"
"and  attempted  to  remove  him  from  the board  of  directors. He  narrates"
"several episodes in the petition in this regard.  These primarily include"
"(a)  the  respondents  breaking  into  the  petitioner’s  office  room  in  the"
"company premises at night in his absence and sealing it after removing"
"documents and equipment; (b) attempting to remove him from the office"
"of  director;  and 
(c)  appointing  extra  security  guards  to  the  project"
"premises without board approval."
"Regarding  the  allegation  of  breaking  into  and  sealing  the  petitioner’s"
"office room, the respondents’ explanation is that the 2nd respondent and"
"members  of  his  family  went  to  the  company  office  at  night  and  took"
"charge of the confidential documents and placed them in the directors’"
"room  and  conference  room  for  safe  custody;  and  on  the  following  day"
"the  petitioner  broke  open  the  sealed  doors  and,  in  the  melee,  even"
"assaulted  the  2nd  respondent.  Criminal  proceedings  were 
instituted"
"against the petitioner and a settlement was reached in Court regarding"
"only 
the  documents 
in 
that  all  documents  of 
the  1st 
respondent"
"company  were  delivered  to  the  2nd  and  3rd  respondents  with  copies  to"
"the petitioner. The position of the respondents is that the removal of the"
"confidential  documents  was  necessitated  because  of  the  dealing  of  the"
"petitioner with his new company."
