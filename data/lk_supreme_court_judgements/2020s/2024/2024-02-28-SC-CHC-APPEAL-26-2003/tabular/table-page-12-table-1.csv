    SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003"
"manner  oppressive  to  any  shareholder  or  shareholders  (including"
"the  shareholder  or  shareholders  with  such  complaint)  may  make"
"an  application  to  court,  for  an  order  under  the  provisions  of  this"
"section."
"In  order  to  succeed  in  an  application  under  oppression,  the  petitioner"
"must establish that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a"
"manner  oppressive  to  the  petitioner  in  his  capacity  as  a  shareholder,"
"not as a director or chief executive officer or in any other capacity."
"In Re Lundie Brothers Ltd [1965] 2 All ER 692 at 699, Plowman J., in an"
"application  filed  under  section  210  of  the  UK  Companies  Act  of  1948"
"which  allowed  a  shareholder  to  come  before  Court  when  the  affairs  of"
"the  company  were  being  conducted  in  a  manner  oppressive  to  him"
"opined:"
"[The shareholder]  has  to establish some  element of lack of probity"
"or  fair  dealing  to  him 
in  his  capacity  as  a  shareholder 
in  the"
"company.    In  my  judgment  he  has  wholly  failed  to  do  that.  His"
"main grievance is, as he admitted in the witness box, that he has"
"been  ousted  as  a  working  director.  That, 
it  seems  to  me,  has"
"nothing  to  do  with  his  status  as  a  shareholder  in  the  company  at"
"all.  The  same  thing  is  equally  true  in  regard  to  his  complaint  that"
"his  remuneration  as  a  director  of  the  company  has  been  reduced."
"That relates to his status as a director of the company, and not to"
"his status as a shareholder of the company."
"In Re J.E. Cade & Son Ltd [1992] BCLC 213 the petition was struck out"
"where the Court found that the petitionerâ€™s true motive in bringing the"
"action was not to obtain relief qua member of the company operating a"
"farm, but to obtain possession of the agricultural land in his capacity as"
"landlord."
