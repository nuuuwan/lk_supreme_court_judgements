"is  no  valid  shareholders’  agreement, 
there 
is  no  oppression  and"
"mismanagement. X11 is unenforceable in law."
"Resignation from the board and the petitioner’s new claim"
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  in  the  further  written"
"submissions  states  that  although  the  respondents’  move  to  oust  the"
"petitioner  was  unsuccessful  in  view  of  this  application  “the  appellant"
"subsequently  had  to  resign  from  board  in  2003  as  he  was  unwilling  to"
"share  the liability for  the respondent’s unilateral  acts  based  on majority"
"which  was contrary  to X11.”   According  to the  document  filed with  the"
"written  submissions,  the  petitioner  resigned  from  the  office  of  director"
"on  20.03.2003  even  before  the  Commercial  High  Court  delivered  its"
"final  order.  For  reasons  best  known  to  him,  the  petitioner  did  not"
"inform this to the Commercial High Court."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  suggests  that  the  most  viable  solution"
"seems to be the 2nd respondent purchasing the petitioner’s shares at a"
"fair  value  through  a  Court-supervised  process,  thereby  enabling  the"
"petitioner  to  exit  from  the  1st  respondent  company.  If  this  was  indeed"
"the  petitioner’s  intention,  he  could  have  brought  it  to  the  attention  of"
"the Commercial High Court. Even though he resigned from the position"
"of  director  while  the  action  was  pending,  he  continued  to  seek  relief"
"against  the  2nd  and  3rd  respondents  to  prevent  his  removal  from  the"
"directorship."
"The petitioner shall understand that this is a final appeal  filed against"
"the 
final  order  of 
the  Commercial  High  Court  and  not  a  revision"
"application.  In this appeal, the Court will consider whether the order of"
"the  Commercial  High  Court  is  right  or  wrong.    The  petitioner  cannot"
"seek different reliefs on appeal."
