"me 
to  be 
relevant.  First, 
there  will  be  cases  where 
there 
is"
"disagreement between petitioners and respondents as to whether a"
"particular  managerial  decision  was,  as  a  matter  of  commercial"
"judgment,  the  right  one  to  make,  or  as  to  whether  a  particular"
"proposal  relating 
to 
the  conduct  of 
the  company’s  business 
is"
"commercially sound. …In my view, it is not for the court to resolve"
"such disagreements on a petition under s. 459. Not only is a judge"
"ill-qualified 
to  do  so,  but 
there  can  be  no  unfairness 
to 
the"
"petitioners  in  those  in  control  of  the  company’s  affairs  taking  a"
"different  view 
from 
theirs  on  such  matters.  Secondly,  as  was"
"persuasively 
argued 
by 
[counsel 
for 
the 
respondents], 
a"
"shareholder acquires shares in a company knowing that their value"
"will 
depend 
in 
some  measure 
on 
the 
competence 
of 
the"
"management.  He  takes  the  risk  that  that  management  may  prove"
"not  to  be  of  the  highest  quality.  Short  of  a  breach  by  a  director  of"
"his  duty  of  skill  and  care  (and  no  such  breach  on  the  part  of"
"[majority  shareholders]  was  alleged) 
there 
is  prima 
facie  no"
"unfairness 
to  a  shareholder 
in 
the  quality  of 
the  management"
"turning  out  to  be  poor.  It  occurred  to  me  during  the  argument  that"
"one example of a case where the court might nonetheless find that"
"there  was  unfair  prejudice  to  minority  shareholders  would  be  one"
"where 
the  majority 
shareholders, 
for 
reasons 
of 
their 
own,"
"persisted 
in 
retaining 
in 
charge 
of 
the  management 
of 
the"
"company’s 
business 
a  member 
of 
their 
family  who  was"
"demonstrably incompetent."
