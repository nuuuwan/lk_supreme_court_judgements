"These  common 
law  obligations  of  directors  have  now  been 
largely"
"replaced  by  statutory  provisions.  Our  Companies  Act  of  2007  makes"
"detailed provisions on the duties and responsibilities of directors. (vide"

"The  conflict  of  interest  that  arose  out  of  the  formation  of  the  new"
"company  Hydro  Power 
International 
(Pvt)  Ltd  by 
the  petitioner 
is"
"practically  proven  when 
the  petitioner 
joined  hands  with  another"
"company by the name of Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd in setting up a hydro"
"power project at Kabaragala in Nuwara Eliya. The petitioner  complains"
"that  the  2nd  and  3rd  respondents  approached  the  directors  of  Natural"
"Power  (Pvt)  Ltd  “behind  his  back”  to  ask  them  to  deal  with  the  1st"
"respondent  company  directly,  but  Natural  Power  (Pvt)  Ltd  entrusted"

"respondents  to  have  approached  Natural  Power  (Pvt)  Ltd  stealthily.  As"
"seen  from  the  document  marked  F,  Natural  Power  (Pvt)  Ltd  earlier"
"entrusted  the  1st  respondent  company  with  setting  up  a  mini  hydro"
"power project at Kabaragala on a turnkey basis and informed the same"
"to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. As seen from G1-G3, the Board"
"of  Investment  of  Sri  Lanka  in  turn  granted  approval  for  the  same."
"However,  the  document  marked  H  goes  to  prove  that  the  petitioner"
"thereafter obtained approval for the same project in his personal name."
"Does this not create a serious conflict between the petitioner’s personal"
"interests and the interests of the 1st respondent company of which he is"
"a  director?  It  does,  and  this  conflict  is  manifestly  detrimental  to  the"
"well-being of the 1st respondent company. The Commercial  High Court"
"cannot  be  found  fault  with  when  it  stated  “it  is  the  petitioner  who  had"
