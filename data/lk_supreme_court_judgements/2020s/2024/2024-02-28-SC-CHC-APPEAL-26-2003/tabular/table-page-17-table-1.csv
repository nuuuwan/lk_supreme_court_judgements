    SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003"
"oppression  of  the  minority  and  mismanagement  of  the  company,  this"
"will satisfy the requirement. Section 225(1)(b) refers to the future when"
"it states “it is likely that the affairs of the company may be conducted in"
"a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company.”"
"Relevance of UK decisions"
"Before  I  move  on  to  mismanagement,  a  word  of  caution  is  required"
"when  English  authorities  are  considered  by  Sri  Lankan  Courts  under"
"“oppression” and “mismanagement” as the statutory provisions are not"
"similar particularly after 1980."
"I do not mean to make a close comparative analysis but thought it fit to"
"refer to some conspicuous differences as learned President’s Counsel for"
"the petitioner drawing attention to section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance,"
"No.  5  of  1852, 
invited  the  Court  to 
look 
into  English  decisions 
in"
"understanding 
his 
main 
argument 
on 
“oppression” 
and"
"“mismanagement”  vis-à-vis  the  shareholders’  agreement,  which  I  will"
"address later."
"In 
the 
first 
place 
we 
have 
clear, 
separate 
provisions 
for"
"“mismanagement” 
(section  211  of  the  Companies  Act  of  1982  and"
"section  225  of  the  Companies  Act  of  2007). 
  However,  there  is  no"
"counterpart in the UK Companies Act."
"There  was  a  provision  for  “oppression”  under  section  210  of  the  UK"
"Companies  Act  of  1948,  in  terms  of  which  any  member  of  a  company"
"who  complained  that  the  affairs  of  the  company  were  being  conducted"
"in a manner oppressive to some part of the members (including himself)"
"could  make  an  application  to  the  Court  by  petition  for  an  order  under"
"that section."
