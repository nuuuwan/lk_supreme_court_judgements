    SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003"
"At  the  argument,  it  was  contended  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner  that  the"
"learned High Court Judge was in error when he stated in the impugned"
"order  that  the  petitioner  did  not  file  a  counter  affidavit  refuting  the"
"allegations  contained  in  the  statement  of  objections  which  amounts  to"
"the  allegations  remaining  unchallenged. 
It  was  submitted 
that 
the"
"counter affidavit of the petitioner is found at page 328 of the brief.  This"
"submission is not correct.  That is not the counter affidavit filed against"
"the  statement  of  objections  to  the  substantive  application  but  against"
"the  application  filed  by  the  respondents  to  vacate  the  interim  orders"
"issued  against  them  ex  parte.  The  respondents  filed  a  statement  of"
"objections  against  the  substantive  reliefs  (page  787  of  the  brief)  and  a"
"separate application praying for vacation of the ex parte interim orders"
"(page 983 of the brief)."
"Another  submission  made  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner  was  that  the  3rd"
"respondent  who  filed  the  affidavit  in  support  of  the  averments  in  the"
"statement of objections did not have personal knowledge to affirm to the"
"facts contained therein.  In the aforesaid counter affidavit tendered for a"
"different purpose, the petitioner says “Therefore the 3rd respondent had"
"no personal knowledge whatsoever of many statements in her affidavit in"
"respect of the period prior to March 1998.”  As I have already stated, the"
"1st  respondent  company  was  incorporated  on  20.03.1998  and  the  3rd"
"respondent  who 
is  a  daughter  of  the  2nd  respondent  was  made  a"
"director  of  the  company  on  the  same  day.  What  holds  significance  in"
"this  application 
is 
the  events 
that  occurred  after 
the  company’s"
"incorporation.  Therefore,  even 
if  the  3rd  respondent 
lacks  personal"
"knowledge  regarding  matters  preceding  the  incorporation,  it  does  not"
"impact the respondents’ case."
"Conclusion"
