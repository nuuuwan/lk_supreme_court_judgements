Samayawardhena, J.

Background

The petitioner-appellant filed this application in the Commercial High

Court under sections 210 (oppression) and 211 (mismanagement) of the

repealed Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982, (which are analogous

respectively to sections 224 and 225 of the new Companies Act, No. 7 of

2007) on the basis that the affairs of the 1st respondent company are

being conducted in a manner oppressive to the petitioner as a minority

shareholder and prejudicial to the interests of the company. The

petitioner sought the following reliefs in the prayer to the petition before

the Commercial High Court:

(a) An order regulating the conduct of the affairs of the 1st

respondent company in future in such a manner as the Court

may decide as to protect the 1st respondent company and its

minority shareholders including the petitioner.

(b) An order directing the 2nd and 3rd respondents not to remove the

petitioner from the office of director of the 1st respondent

company.

(c) An order directing the petitioner be permitted to carry out the

functions of the Chief Executive Officer of the 1st respondent

company.

(d) An order directing that the petitioner be a joint signatory to all

Bank Accounts of the 1st respondent company.

(e) An order directing the 2nd and 3rd respondents not to do any act

to diminish or suppress the petitioners shareholding in the 1st

respondent company.

Upon completion of the pleadings, the parties agreed that the main

inquiry/substantive application could be disposed of on written

4

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

submissions. After both parties filed written submissions, the

Commercial High Court by order dated 07.05.2003 dismissed the

application of the petitioner with costs on the basis that it is not the

conduct of the 2nd and 3rd respondents but the conduct of the petitioner

[that] is oppressive and detrimental to the 1st respondent company.

Being dissatisfied with the order, the petitioner filed this appeal. The

gravamen of the argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner before this Court is that the petitioner must succeed in this

appeal on oppression and mismanagement particularly in view of the

shareholders agreement marked X11.

The 1st respondent company was incorporated under the Companies

Act on 20.03.1998 to carry on the business of generating hydro power

to be supplied to the national grid and related services (X1). The

petitioner, a Sri Lankan national with a PhD in electrical engineering,

holds a 20% share in the 1st respondent company, while the 2nd

respondent, a Japanese national and the investor, holds 80% of the

share capital in the same company. Both were directors at the time of

the incorporation of the company. As seen from the minutes of the first

board meeting marked X26(a) held on the date of incorporation, the 3rd

respondent who is a daughter of the 2nd respondent was appointed a

director with the agreement of the petitioner. They started their mini

hydro power project at Wijeriya in Kolonne.

Petitioners allegations

Let me now consider the allegations of the petitioner against the 2nd

respondent major shareholder in seeking the said reliefs under

oppression and mismanagement.

The petitioner in paragraph 7 of the petition says that the 2nd

respondent abused his powers as the major shareholder in that he

5

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

rejected a proposed investor (Dr. Rajakaruna); arbitrarily increased the

capacity of the project from 500 kW to 750 kW despite an inadequate

volume of water; and developed infrastructure facilities causing

additional cost overrun. But according to letter X8 written by Dr.

Rajakaruna to the petitioner, neither Dr. Rajakaruna nor the petitioner

intended to invest any money in the 1st respondent company and

instead expected to offer their services/expertise to the company.

Furthermore, the documents C1-C3 show that the petitioner approved

and actively participated in the decision to increase the capacity of the

project from 500 kW to 750 kW. The petitioners claims lack impact and

are unconvincing.

The petitioner says in paragraph 10:

Around May 1998, the 3rd respondent who had come to Sri Lanka

was made a director of the 1st respondent company by the 2nd

respondent. By this time, since the 1st respondent company was

facing many problems caused by the 2nd respondents misuse of

power and arbitrary decisions, including the said cost overrun, the

petitioner insisted that he should be given certain rights including

50% of profits of the company.

According to the petitioner, it is against this backdrop that the

shareholders agreement X11 was drawn up in June 1998 and signed

after amendments on 29.10.1998.

The 1st respondent company was incorporated in March 1998.

According to the petitioner, around May 1998 the 1st respondent

company was facing many problems. In the formative stage of any

company, this may not be unusual. If the company was facing many

problems, is it proper and sensible for the petitioner as a responsible

shareholder and director to have demanded further rights including

6

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

50% of the profits of the company especially when he held only 20% of

the issued share capital? In my judgment, it is not.

I will deal with the shareholders agreement separately later on.

The petitioner in paragraph 11 of the petition says that in October

1999, the 2nd respondent obtained Rs. 1 million from the company to

change his residence to a more luxurious and prestigious place. By

producing the lease agreements marked P1 and P2, the respondents

show that this was done because the deposit, advance and monthly

rentals payable were cheaper for the new residence. Monthly rentals

have been paid by the 2nd respondent personally and not by the

company.

In paragraph 13 the petitioner speaks of loan facilities obtained for the

project with his assistance. Obtaining loans is not mismanagement of

the company and there is no allegation that the company was unable to

repay such loans. The 1st respondent company was incorporated in

March 1998 and the petitioner admits that the Kolonne mini hydro

power project was commissioned in February 1999 and the Ceylon

Electricity Board commenced purchasing electricity from that month

onwards. The project was not a failure but a success.

Paragraph 14 of the petition is revealing. I take the view that the

disclosures contained therein is crucial in the determination of this

case. The petitioner says he incorporated two companies. One is Hydro

Power International (Pvt) Ltd incorporated on 09.06.1999 for the

purpose of engaging in mini hydro power projects to supply hydro

power to the national grid. This is the same purpose for which the 1st

respondent company was incorporated and therefore it is clearly a rival

company creating a situation of potential conflict of interest between the

petitioner and the 1st respondent company. The shareholders of this

7

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

new company are the petitioner and his wife. According to the

respondents, it is the formation of the new company that triggered the

actual dispute between the petitioner and the respondents. I have no

difficulty in accepting this assertion of the respondents, although there

would have been differences of opinion between the petitioner and 2nd

respondent in managing the affairs of the company before this new

development.

In Re Five Minute Car Wash Service Ltd. [1966] 1 WLR 745 at 751

Buckley J. stated:

The mere fact that a member of a company has lost confidence in

the manner in which the companys affairs are conducted does not

lead to the conclusion that he is oppressed; nor can resentment at

being outvoted; nor mere dissatisfaction with or disapproval of the

conduct of the companys affairs, whether on grounds relating to

policy or to efficiency, however well founded. Those who are

alleged to have acted oppressively must be shown to have acted at

least unfairly towards those who claim to have been oppressed.

Transgression of fiduciary duty

A company, a fictional entity created by law, is governed by its

directors. They have been considered as trustees, partners, agents etc.

for the company. Regardless of the categorisation that may apply to

directors within a company, the fundamental principle remains

unchanged: they owe a fiduciary duty to the company as a whole.

Directors must act with good faith and unwavering loyalty, prioritising

the best interests of the company over their personal interests. They

should never allow their duties to the company to be compromised by

conflicts of interest, nor should they engage in competition with the

company. (vide Gowers Principles of Modern Company Law, 10th Edition

8

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

(2016), pp. 462-562; Charlesworths Company Law, 17th Edition (2005),

pp. 297-321)

These common law obligations of directors have now been largely

replaced by statutory provisions. Our Companies Act of 2007 makes

detailed provisions on the duties and responsibilities of directors. (vide

sections 187-220)

The conflict of interest that arose out of the formation of the new

company Hydro Power International (Pvt) Ltd by the petitioner is

practically proven when the petitioner joined hands with another

company by the name of Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd in setting up a hydro

power project at Kabaragala in Nuwara Eliya. The petitioner complains

that the 2nd and 3rd respondents approached the directors of Natural

Power (Pvt) Ltd behind his back to ask them to deal with the 1st

respondent company directly, but Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd entrusted

their project to be handled by Hydro Power International (Pvt) Ltd. The

conduct of the petitioner is reprehensible. There was no reason for the

respondents to have approached Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd stealthily. As

seen from the document marked F, Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd earlier

entrusted the 1st respondent company with setting up a mini hydro

power project at Kabaragala on a turnkey basis and informed the same

to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. As seen from G1-G3, the Board

of Investment of Sri Lanka in turn granted approval for the same.

However, the document marked H goes to prove that the petitioner

thereafter obtained approval for the same project in his personal name.

Does this not create a serious conflict between the petitioners personal

interests and the interests of the 1st respondent company of which he is

a director? It does, and this conflict is manifestly detrimental to the

well-being of the 1st respondent company. The Commercial High Court

cannot be found fault with when it stated it is the petitioner who had

9

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

breached his fiduciary duties he owes to the 1st respondent company in

order to obtain personal benefits.

In relation to the Kabaragala project, by X15(a) dated 25.11.1999, the

petitioner had this to say to the 3rd respondent:

I have completely given up the idea of doing Kabaragala project by

MKN [the 1st respondent company] and informed my decision to NP

[Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd] since I should look after the interests of NP

being the technical director of that company. Even if you didnt

bother to tell me, I was informed by NP that directors of NP were

met by you all and wanted to do the project by you all without me.

After having judged all aspects, they have decided not to give the

project to MKN, and will be handled by Hydro Power

International [the rival company the petitioner incorporated with

his wife]. Since I have big doubts on the success of partnership

with you for subsequent projects, I dont want to have any link

with you for my future projects.

By this letter the petitioner makes it clear that he would maintain a

business relationship with the 1st respondent company only for the mini

hydro power project at Wijeriya in Kolonne. In that context, can he be

allowed to continue as a director of the 1st respondent company? In that

context, is it unreasonable if the majority shareholder, holding 80% of

the shareholding and seemingly the exclusive financial investor,

believes that allowing the petitioner to continue as a director would

serve no purpose other than to potentially undermine the companys

prospects? I am unable to accept the submission of learned Presidents

Counsel for the petitioner that allegations of conflict of interest were

wrong where the appellant had disclosed his interest in the other

company and the 1st respondent company had only one approved project

and no further mandate from BOI as revealed through boards minutes. If

10

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

this submission is correct, for instance, the allegations levelled against

the 2nd respondent by the petitioner in X15(a) in relation to dealings

with Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd are meaningless. What is the purpose of

the petitioner stating in X15(a) that he does not want to work with the

1st respondent company on future projects?

The petitioner states that after Natural Power (Pvt) Ltd rejected the offer

of the 2nd respondent and accepted that of the petitioner, the 2nd and 3rd

respondents orchestrated a strategy to suppress the rights of the

petitioner as a shareholder and director of the 1st respondent company

and attempted to remove him from the board of directors. He narrates

several episodes in the petition in this regard. These primarily include

(a) the respondents breaking into the petitioners office room in the

company premises at night in his absence and sealing it after removing

documents and equipment; (b) attempting to remove him from the office

of director; and (c) appointing extra security guards to the project

premises without board approval.

Regarding the allegation of breaking into and sealing the petitioners

office room, the respondents explanation is that the 2nd respondent and

members of his family went to the company office at night and took

charge of the confidential documents and placed them in the directors

room and conference room for safe custody; and on the following day

the petitioner broke open the sealed doors and, in the melee, even

assaulted the 2nd respondent. Criminal proceedings were instituted

against the petitioner and a settlement was reached in Court regarding

only the documents in that all documents of the 1st respondent

company were delivered to the 2nd and 3rd respondents with copies to

the petitioner. The position of the respondents is that the removal of the

confidential documents was necessitated because of the dealing of the

petitioner with his new company.

11

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

In Re Five Minute Car Wash Service Ltd. (supra) at 751 Buckley J.

stated:

First, the matters complained of must affect the person or persons

alleged to have been oppressed in his or their character as a

member or members of the company. Harsh or unfair treatment of

the petitioner in some other capacity, as, for instance, a director or

a creditor of the company, or as a person doing business or having

dealings with the company, or in relation to his personal affairs

apart from the company, cannot entitle him to any relief under

section 210.

The attempt to remove the petitioner as a director of the company and

the breakdown of the relationship between him and the other directors

are not decisive to decide the question of oppression. Even if he were

removed from the office of director and chief executive officer, such

removal ipso facto does not qualify the petitioner to successfully make

an application under oppression because it has prima facie nothing to

do with his shareholding in the company. The reliefs sought in

paragraphs (b)-(d) in the prayer to the petition cannot be granted under

the rubric of oppression unless the petitioner can affirmatively show

how such changes adversely affect him as a shareholder of the

company. The petitioner has failed to satisfy the Commercial High

Court in this regard. Sweeping statements and mere conjectures, in lieu

of substantiated evidence, fall short of the requisite standard.

Oppression

Section 224(1) of the Companies Act of 2007 reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of section 226, any shareholder or

shareholders of a company who has a complaint against the

company that the affairs of such company are being conducted in a

12

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

manner oppressive to any shareholder or shareholders (including

the shareholder or shareholders with such complaint) may make

an application to court, for an order under the provisions of this

section.

In order to succeed in an application under oppression, the petitioner

must establish that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a

manner oppressive to the petitioner in his capacity as a shareholder,

not as a director or chief executive officer or in any other capacity.

In Re Lundie Brothers Ltd [1965] 2 All ER 692 at 699, Plowman J., in an

application filed under section 210 of the UK Companies Act of 1948

which allowed a shareholder to come before Court when the affairs of

the company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to him

opined:

[The shareholder] has to establish some element of lack of probity

or fair dealing to him in his capacity as a shareholder in the

company. In my judgment he has wholly failed to do that. His

main grievance is, as he admitted in the witness box, that he has

been ousted as a working director. That, it seems to me, has

nothing to do with his status as a shareholder in the company at

all. The same thing is equally true in regard to his complaint that

his remuneration as a director of the company has been reduced.

That relates to his status as a director of the company, and not to

his status as a shareholder of the company.

In Re J.E. Cade & Son Ltd [1992] BCLC 213 the petition was struck out

where the Court found that the petitioners true motive in bringing the

action was not to obtain relief qua member of the company operating a

farm, but to obtain possession of the agricultural land in his capacity as

landlord.

13

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

Due to the infinite variability of circumstances in which oppression may

arise, it is inherently intricate to provide a precise legal definition to the

term oppression. The determination of whether oppression exists

necessitates a case-by-case evaluation of the unique facts and

circumstances. In the House of Lords case of Scottish Co-operative

Wholesale Society Limited v. Meyer [1958] 3 All ER 66 at 71, Lord

Simonds described the meaning of the term oppression in this context

as the majority exercising authority over the minority in a manner that

is burdensome, harsh and wrongful. This definition was adopted in Re

H.R. Harmer Ltd [1958] 3 All ER 689 and in many other cases.

Lord Keith in Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited (supra)

stated at 86:

Oppression under s. 210 may take various forms. It suggests, to

my mind, as I said in Elder v. Elder & Watson (1952 SC 49), a lack

of probity and fair dealing in the affairs of a company to the

prejudice of some portion of its members.

The oppression and mismanagement shall relate to the affairs of the

company. The term affairs of the company found in relevant sections

on oppression and mismanagement, in our jurisdiction, in the UK and

India, extends to a wider spectrum of company-related activities and

decisions, encompassing various aspects of corporate governance,

management, and conduct.

However, a shareholder who seeks relief against oppression can only

claim what he is legally entitled to and not what his whims and fancies

demand. But I must add that legal rights are not limited to strict legal

rights embodied only in the articles of association of the company. It

may encompass legal rights grounded in broader equitable

considerations, such as legitimate expectations of a shareholdera

14

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

concept traditionally rooted in fairness as evaluated by an objective

standard. Additionally, these rights may emanate from statutory

provisions (such as section 49(2) of the Companies Act of 2007),

contractual agreements (such as shareholder agreements), equity

interests in the company, and the governance structures that define the

companys management framework and decision-making processes.

Moreover, fiduciary duties and responsibilities owed by directors may

also give rise to additional legal rights and obligations beyond the

confines of the articles of association. However, the bottom line is that

both the claim of the shareholder and the granting of that relief by the

company must have a legal foundation.

Lord Hoffmann in the House of Lords case of ONeill v. Phillips [1999] 2

All ER 961 at 966-967 opined:

In the case of section 459 [of the UK Companies Act of 1985], the

background has the following two features. First, a company is an

association of persons for an economic purpose, usually entered

into with legal advice and some degree of formality. The terms of

the association are contained in the articles of association and

sometimes in collateral agreements between the shareholders.

Thus the manner in which the affairs of the company may be

conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders

have agreed. Secondly, company law has developed seamlessly

from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity, like the

Roman societas, as a contract of good faith. One of the traditional

roles of equity, as a separate jurisdiction, was to restrain the

exercise of strict legal rights in certain relationships in which it

considered that this would be contrary to good faith. These

principles have, with appropriate modification, been carried over

into company law.

15

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

In Re Elgindata Ltd [1991] BCLC 959 at 985 Warner J. referring to the

cases of Re Posgate & Denby (Agencies) Ltd [1987] BCLC 667 and Re a

company (No 005685 of 1988), ex p Schwarz (No 2) [1989] BCLC 427

stated:

In general members of a company have no legitimate expectations

going beyond the legal rights conferred on them by the constitution

of the company, that is to say its memorandum and articles of

association. Nonetheless, legitimate expectations superimposed on

a members legal rights may arise from agreements or

understandings between the members. Where, however, the

acquisition of shares in a company is one of the results of a

complex set of formal written agreements it is a question of

construction of those agreements whether any such superimposed

legitimate expectations can arise.

K. Kanag-Isvaran and Dilshani Wijayawardana in Company Law (2014),

p.518 state:

When a shareholder complains of oppression on the part of the

company, he must show that he has been constrained to submit to

a conduct, which lacks probity, is unfair to him and which causes

prejudice to his legal and proprietary rights as a shareholder. The

acts complained of must deny to the complaining shareholder or

shareholders their rights, or their legitimate expectations as

shareholders. The rights and legitimate expectations of

shareholders must be those rights and expectations the company

can and should honour on a legal basis, and the shareholders can

demand as of right, and not every wish and fancy of a

shareholder.

16

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

The term oppression generally does not include conduct that is merely

inefficient, negligent or careless, although such conduct can fall under

mismanagement in the event such conduct is persistent and the

consequences serious, thereby prejudicially affecting the interests of the

company. In Re Five Minute Car Wash Service Ltd (supra) at 752

Buckley J. held that allegations that the chairman and managing

director of a company had been unwise, inefficient and careless in the

performance of his duties could not without more amount to allegations

of oppressive conduct for the purposes of section 210 of the UK

Companies Act of 1948. However no hard and fast rule can be laid

down. In Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited (supra) at 88,

Lord Denning considered inaction as a species of oppression:

It is said that these three directors were, at most, only guilty of

inactionof doing nothing to protect the textile company. But the

affairs of a company can, in my opinion, be conducted oppressively

by the directors doing nothing to defend its interests when they

ought to do somethingjust as they can conduct its affairs

oppressively by doing something injurious to its interests when

they ought not to do it.

Under our law, it may difficult to establish oppression by referring to

one isolated incident of past conduct; it has to be a course of conduct.

The oppressive conduct shall be of a recurring nature at the time of

filing the application, as section 224(1) of the Companies Act of 2007

provides the affairs of such company are being conducted in a manner

oppressive to any shareholder. Similar wording can be found in section

225(b) under mismanagement. However, these terms should not be

interpreted overly restrictively. If the effect of a wrongful single act in

the past (such as the wrongful issuance of shares, diverting company

funds for personal use) continues and results in the persistent

17

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

oppression of the minority and mismanagement of the company, this

will satisfy the requirement. Section 225(1)(b) refers to the future when

it states it is likely that the affairs of the company may be conducted in

a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company.

Relevance of UK decisions

Before I move on to mismanagement, a word of caution is required

when English authorities are considered by Sri Lankan Courts under

oppression and mismanagement as the statutory provisions are not

similar particularly after 1980.

I do not mean to make a close comparative analysis but thought it fit to

refer to some conspicuous differences as learned Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner drawing attention to section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance,

No. 5 of 1852, invited the Court to look into English decisions in

understanding his main argument on oppression and

mismanagement vis--vis the shareholders agreement, which I will

address later.

In the first place we have clear, separate provisions for

mismanagement (section 211 of the Companies Act of 1982 and

section 225 of the Companies Act of 2007). However, there is no

counterpart in the UK Companies Act.

There was a provision for oppression under section 210 of the UK

Companies Act of 1948, in terms of which any member of a company

who complained that the affairs of the company were being conducted

in a manner oppressive to some part of the members (including himself)

could make an application to the Court by petition for an order under

that section.

18

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

But by section 75 of the UK Companies Act of 1980, the word

oppression was replaced by unfair prejudice:

Any member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an

order under this section on the ground that the affairs of the

company are being or have been conducted in a manner which is

unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members

(including at least himself) or that any actual or proposed act or

omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf)

is or would be so prejudicial.

This was repeated in section 459 of the UK Companies Act of 1985,

which was later slightly amended by the UK Companies Act of 1989

with the substitution of unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its

members generally or of some part of its members for unfairly

prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members:

Any member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an

order under this section on the ground that the affairs of the

company are being or have been conducted in a manner which is

unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members generally or of

some part of the members (including at least himself) or that any

actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act

or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.

Section 994 of the UK Companies Act of 2006 which represents the

current law reiterates the same.

It may be noted that unfair prejudice introduced by the UK

Companies Act of 1980 and carried forward up to now must be given a

broader meaning than oppression. (Palmers Company Law, 24th

Edition (1987), Vol 1, p.989) Hence cases decided under unfair

prejudice by UK Courts cannot be directly applicable to the

19

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

determination of oppression in our jurisdiction although they serve as

useful guides for interpreting our provisions appropriately.

It may also be relevant to note that even under mismanagement

(under section 225 of the Companies Act of 2007), only the word

prejudice is used, not unfair prejudice. Unfairness and prejudice

are different concepts. This is highlighted in Gowers Principles of

Modern Company Law, 10th Edition (2016), pp. 672-673:

In a number of cases the courts have stressed that the section itself

requires prejudice to the minority which is unfair, and not just

prejudice per se. Sometimes what was done to the petitioner was

unfair, but it caused him or her no prejudice, for example, because

no loss was inflicted: in these cases s.994 [of the UK Companies

Act of 2006] is not open.

Section 994 of the UK Companies Act of 2006 makes express provisions

to establish unfair prejudice not only for the present acts but also for

past and future acts when it says are being or have been conducted

and any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an

act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.

Mismanagement

Section 225(1) of the Companies Act of 2007 reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of section 226, any shareholder or

shareholders of a company, having a complaint

(a) that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner

prejudicial to the interests of the company; or

(b) that a material change (not being a change brought about by or

in the interest of any creditors, including debenture holders or

20

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

any class of shareholders of the company) has taken place in

the management or control of the company, whether by an

alteration in its board of directors or of its agent or secretary or

in the constitution or control of the firm or body corporate acting

as its agent or secretary or in the ownership of the shares of the

company or in any other manner whatsoever, and that by

reason of such change it is likely that the affairs of the company

may be conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the

company,

may make an application to court for an order under the provisions

of this section.

In order to succeed in an application on mismanagement under

section 225 of the Companies Act of 2007 (211 of the Companies Act of

1982), the petitioner must establish that the affairs of the company are

being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company

or that a material change has taken place in the management or control

of the company which makes it likely that the affairs of the company

may be conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the

company.

Material changes such as the removal of a director or the company

secretary or auditors may initially seem significant. However, if these

actions are carried out in good faith and in accordance with the

companys articles of association for the overall betterment of the

company, they may not provide sufficient grounds for a minority

shareholder to successfully pursue an application under the claim of

mismanagement. It is essential to recognise that not every material

change automatically and invariably harms the interests of the

company. For example, if such changes are undertaken to enhance

corporate governance, streamline operations, or address genuine

21

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

concerns, they may ultimately benefit the company and its shareholders

as a whole.

In the case of Re Blue Arrow PLC [1987] BCLC 585, the Court refused to

intervene under unfairly prejudicial conduct to cancel a special

resolution altering the articles of the company so as to make the

president of the company or the chairman of the board of directors

removable by board resolution, whereas previously the same was only

possible by a resolution passed at a general meeting.

A decision by the board of directors to change the business or to

continue carrying on the business despite trading losses or to sell the

business to an outsider will not per se warrant the Court to give relief to

a minority shareholder if those business decisions were made in good

faith. (vide Re Saul D Harrison PLC [1994] 2 BCC 475, Re Posgate and

Denby (Agencies) Ltd [1987] BCLC 8)

Under mismanagement, the petitioner must make the application in

good faith in furtherance of the best interests of the company as a

shareholder and not in the best interests of himself as an investor.

The test to be adopted in deciding whether or not the affairs of a

company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to a shareholder

(oppression) or in a manner prejudicial to the company

(mismanagement) is objective as opposed to subjective. (Palmers

Company Law, op. cit., paragraph 66-06, Halsburys Laws of England,

Vol.14, (2009) 5th edition, pp 991-993 (paragraph 468)

In Re RA Noble & Sons (Clothing) Ltd [1983] BCLC 273 at 290-291,

Nourse J. stated that it is not necessary for the petitioner to show that

the persons who have had de facto control of the company have acted as

they did in the conscious knowledge that this was unfair to the petitioner

or that they were acting in bad faith; the testis whether a reasonable

22

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

bystander observing the consequences of their conduct, would regard it

as having unfairly prejudiced the petitioners interests.

In reference to section 459(1) of the UK Companies Act of 1985 in the

case of Re Sam Weller & Sons Ltd [1990] Ch 682 at 690, Peter Gibson J.

stated:

To my mind, the wording of the section imports an objective test.

One simply looks to see whether the manner in which the affairs of

the company have been conducted can be described as unfairly

prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members. That, as

[counsel for the petitioner] submitted, requires an objective

assessment of the quality of the conduct. Thus, conduct which is

unfairly prejudicial to the petitioners interests, even if not

intended to be so, may nevertheless come within the section.

The lawful removal of directors in terms of the articles of association,

protection of company property including business files, recruitment of

additional security personal, attracting new businesses, and (as

submitted during the argument) non-payment of dividends etc., which

the petitioner in the instant case relies on to establish his case, cannot,

on the facts and circumstances of this case, be regarded as oppressive

to the petitioner as a shareholder or mismanagement of the company.

In Re Lundie Brothers Ltd (supra) at 699, Plowman J. stated:

There is also a complaintor what I take to be a complaintin the

petition that he has received no dividend on his shares in the

company. The company in fact has never paid any dividends. Its

policy has been substantially to divide its profits between directors

and not to pay any dividend on its shares. But no case is either

pleaded or has been established for concluding that the companys

failure to pay dividends was oppressive to the shareholders of the

23

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

company and, indeed, there may well have been sound commercial

reasons for not declaring any dividend.

In the Indian case of Jaladhar Chakraborty v. Power Tools and

Appliances Co (1992) 2 CALLT 64 HC it was held that omission to

declare dividends does not constitute an act of oppression or

mismanagement.

The articles of association of the 1st respondent company marked X1(b)

provides for the conduct of the affairs of the company including the

removal of directors, rights to dividends etc., and therefore both the

petitioner and 2nd respondent are lawfully entitled to invoke these

provisions.

The need to exercise the jurisdiction of Court with extreme caution

The essence of democracy is majority rule. The general rule is that

disputes among shareholders shall be resolved within the scope of the

articles of association of the company, which is the constitution of the

company. This is done by majority vote of the shareholders at a general

meeting or by majority vote of the board of directors. According to

section 13 of the Companies Act of 2007, the articles of association is

expected to provide for the objects of the company, the rights and

obligations of shareholders of the company, and the management and

administration of the company.

The Court is unwilling, and indeed lacks jurisdiction, to reevaluate

genuine business decisions made by the board of directors or majority

shareholders after careful deliberation encompassing a broad spectrum

of practical factors. It is not within the purview of the Court to

substitute these legitimate business judgments with the judgments of

the Court, confined as they are to the strict interpretation of the law

and the limited facts presented during the legal proceedings.

24

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

Unless the Court is fully convinced that majority power has been

abused and used mala fide for collateral purposes and not in the best

interests of the company thereby suppressing the legitimate rights of

the minority camp, the Court need not unnecessarily interfere with

matters of commercial judgment or policy or the internal administration

of the company so long as they are intra vires the company. If the Court

still decides to intervene, there shall be compelling, cogent reasons for

doing so.

In the Privy Council case of Burland v. Earle [1902] AC 83 at 93, Lord

Davey was emphatic in confirming this non-interventionist attitude of

judges:

It is an elementary principle of law relating to joint stock companies

that the Court will not interfere with the internal management of

companies acting within their powers, and in fact has no

jurisdiction to do so.

The Court shall bear in mind the relevant observation made in Fisher v.

Cadman [2006] 1 BCLC 499 at 530:

[T]he mismanagement relied upon for the purposes of a claim under

section 459 [of the UK Companies Act of 1985] must be serious,

and that the Court will be astute not to second guess legitimate

management decisions taken upon reasonable grounds at the time,

albeit as events transpired, they may not have been the best

decisions in the interests of the Company.

Kanag-Isvaran and Wijayawardana, op. cit., p. 520 state:

Directors in whom are vested the right and duty of deciding where

the companys interests lie and how they are to be served, are

concerned with a wide range of practical considerations, and when

25

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

their judgment, is exercised in good faith and not for an irrelevant

purpose, the courts of law will not assume the position of a kind of

supervisory board over such decision. It is not unfair for directors in

good faith to advance the objects of the company, or to embark

upon new business opportunities even to the prejudice of a

shareholder or a group of shareholders, where such advancement

is in the best interests of the company. Prima facie, it is for the

directors, and not for the court, to decide whether the furthering of

a corporate interest which is inimical to a shareholder or

shareholders should prevail over those interests, or whether some

balance should be struck between them.

However, this should never be taken to mean that there is a general

prohibition on Court intervention in the internal affairs of a company.

The Court must not always construe the imprecise concepts of

oppression and mismanagement narrowly and technically and

render the statutory provisions on oppression and mismanagement

nugatory. In appropriate cases, the Court may, nay shall, exercise its

statutory duty to protect minority shareholders from oppression by the

majority, and to prevent mismanagement that jeopardices the

companys best interests. The necessity for intervention depends on the

facts and circumstances peculiar to each case.

Warner J. in Re Elgindata Ltd [1991] BCLC 959 at 993-994 opined:

I do not doubt that in an appropriate case it is open to the court to

find that serious mismanagement of a companys business

constitutes conduct that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of

minority shareholders. But I share Peter Gibson Js view [in Re

Sam Weller & Sons Ltd [1990] BCLC 80 at 89] that the court will

normally be very reluctant to accept that managerial decisions can

amount to unfairly prejudicial conduct. Two considerations seem to

26

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

me to be relevant. First, there will be cases where there is

disagreement between petitioners and respondents as to whether a

particular managerial decision was, as a matter of commercial

judgment, the right one to make, or as to whether a particular

proposal relating to the conduct of the companys business is

commercially sound. In my view, it is not for the court to resolve

such disagreements on a petition under s. 459. Not only is a judge

ill-qualified to do so, but there can be no unfairness to the

petitioners in those in control of the companys affairs taking a

different view from theirs on such matters. Secondly, as was

persuasively argued by [counsel for the respondents], a

shareholder acquires shares in a company knowing that their value

will depend in some measure on the competence of the

management. He takes the risk that that management may prove

not to be of the highest quality. Short of a breach by a director of

his duty of skill and care (and no such breach on the part of

[majority shareholders] was alleged) there is prima facie no

unfairness to a shareholder in the quality of the management

turning out to be poor. It occurred to me during the argument that

one example of a case where the court might nonetheless find that

there was unfair prejudice to minority shareholders would be one

where the majority shareholders, for reasons of their own,

persisted in retaining in charge of the management of the

companys business a member of their family who was

demonstrably incompetent.

In Re Elgindata Ltd, R and his wife being minority shareholders of the

company commenced proceedings under section 459 of the UK

Companies Act 1985 alleging that P being the majority shareholder had

conducted the affairs of the company in a way that was unfairly

prejudicial to their interests. The allegations of unfair prejudice were

27

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

broadly that (i) R was not consulted with respect to policy decisions on

which he had a right to be consulted, (ii) P managed the affairs of the

company in a manner that was incompetent, and (iii) P misused the

assets of the company for his own personal and family benefit. The

Court held that the affairs of the company have been conducted in a

manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the petitioners. In the

course of the reasoning it was inter alia observed that P had improperly

used the companys assets for the benefit of himself, his family and his

friends; and although this only had a limited impact on the value of the

shares of R and his wife nevertheless it constituted unfairly prejudicial

conduct since it would be unfair to leave R and his wife locked in the

company because of Ps propensity for using the companys assets for

his personal benefit.

At page 1004 it was emphasised that one way, but not the only way, in

which a member of a company may bring himself within s. 459 is by

showing that the value of his shares in the company has been seriously

diminished or at least seriously jeopardised by reason of a course of

conduct on the part of those in control of the company which has been

unfair to him.

In Re Macro (Ipswich) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 354 at 404-405, Arden J.

observed:

With respect to alleged mismanagement, the court does not

interfere in questions of commercial judgment, such as would arise

here if (for example) it were alleged that the companies should

invest in commercial properties rather than residential properties.

However, in cases where what is shown is mismanagement, rather

than a difference of opinion on the desirability of particular

commercial decisions, and the mismanagement is sufficiently

28

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

serious to justify the intervention by the court, a remedy is

available under s. 459.

In Re Macro (Ipswich) Ltd, proceedings were instituted inter alia under

section 459 of the UK Companies Act of 1985 on minority oppression by

the majority shareholder. It was held:

The question of whether any action was or would be unfairly

prejudicial had to be judged on an objective basis. The questions

which the court had to answer were (a) was the conduct of which

complaint was made prejudicial to the members interests, and (b)

if the answer to the first question was in the positive was it

unfairly so? Where conduct was unfairly prejudicial to the financial

interests of the company then it would also be unfairly prejudicial

to the interests of its members. In assessing the fairness of the

conduct, the court had to perform a balancing act in weighing the

various interests of different groups within the company. The court

did not interfere in questions of commercial management but where

the mismanagement was sufficiently significant and serious so as

to cause loss to the company then it could constitute the basis for

finding unfair prejudice. On the facts, the petitioners had identified

sufficient acts of serious mismanagement to show that the affairs

of the companies had been conducted in a manner which was

unfairly prejudicial to their interests. Also, it was unfairly

prejudicial for the petitioning shareholders to remain in the

companies which were controlled by T [the majority shareholder]

and on the boards of which there was no independent director. The

court would order T to purchase the shares of the petitioners, the

purchase price to be based on principles of valuation laid down by

the court.

29

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

Re London School of Electronics Ltd [1986] Ch 211 is a case where the

petitioner filed action seeking relief under section 75 of the Companies

Act 1980. In this case the company, London School of Electronics Ltd

(LSE) ran courses in electronics. The petitioner was a director and 25%

shareholder of the LSE. The remaining shares were held by the

respondent company, City Tutorial College Ltd (CTC). CTC employed the

petitioner, a director and 25% shareholder, as a teacher. Later on,

relationships broke down and CTC passed a resolution removing the

petitioner as a director of LSE. Then the most of LSEs students were

transferred to CTC. The petitioner set up a rival institution in the

same centre as CTC and took 12 LSE students with him. Then the

petitioner sought a purchase order for his 25% shares in LSE. He

claimed that the conduct of the respondent had been unfairly

prejudicial to his interests. The Court granted the petitioners order for

purchasing his 25% shares in LSE. Nourse J. held at 223:

In my judgment it was CTCs decision to appropriate the B.Sc

students to itself which was the effective cause of the breakdown

in the relationship of mutual confidence between the quasi-

partners. Furthermore, that was clearly conduct on the part of CTC

which was both unfair and prejudicial to the interests of the

petitioner as a member of the company.

The Court did not consider the petitioners removal of some students to

his institution would render the prejudicial conduct no longer unfair

since it was CTC which had unfairly brought about the petitioners

departure from the company.

In Re Haden Bill Electrical Ltd [1995] 2 BCLC 280, the petitioner had

been in de facto control of the company as chairman although he owned

only 25% of the shares. His own company loaned 200,000 to the

company as working capital. He complained under section 459 of the

30

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

UK Companies Act of 1985 that he had been removed as a director. It

was held that the company was to be treated as a quasi-partnership

and, as long as the loan was outstanding, he had a legitimate

expectation of being involved in the management of the company and

his removal as director was unfairly prejudicial to him.

Notwithstanding wide powers have been conferred on the Court to

regulate the affairs of the company by way of final orders, interim

orders, restraining orders, by sections 224, 225, 228, 233, 521 of the

Companies Act of 2007, which empower the Court to make such orders

as it thinks fit upon such terms and conditions as appear to it to be

just and equitable akin to the powers of the Labour Tribunal, the Court

must be extremely cautious and jealous in exercising these powers. The

Court has neither the knowledge nor authority to dictate terms to the

board of directors on how to manage the company. The orders which

could be made as it thinks fit shall be confined to remedying the

matters complained of.

The petitioner cannot couch his reliefs in broad terms. The main relief

of the petitioner in paragraph (a) of the prayer to the petition is too

wide:

An order regulating the conduct of the affairs of the 1st respondent

company in future in such a manner as the Court may decide as to

protect the 1st respondent company and its minority shareholders

including the petitioner.

The reliefs sought under oppression and mismanagement must be

specific so that inter alia the opposing party can assist the Court by

alerting in advance the consequences that would follow in the

management of the company in the event such reliefs are granted. (Re

31

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

Antigen Laboratories Ltd [1951] 1 All ER 110; Ghosh & Dr. Chandratres

Company Law, 13th Edition (2007), Vol 3, pp.4878-4879)

Relief under oppression and mismanagement is discretionary

The remedy provided by the Companies Act for shareholders to seek

Court intervention in cases of oppression and mismanagement is both

equitable and discretionary. This remedy is rooted in principles of

equity and justice, even though it is now based on statutory provisions.

According to sections 224 and 225, the court may make such orders as

it thinks fit on just and equitable considerations.

Penningtons Company Law, 7th Edition (1995), p. 901 states:

A petition for relief from oppression under the original statutory

provision would be dismissed if it was not presented in good faith

solely in order to obtain such relief, and because of the equitable

and therefore discretionary character of the Courts jurisdiction

under both the original [section 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948]

and the present provision [section 459 of the UK Companies Act

1985 and section 994 of the UK Companies Act 2006], the

requirement of good faith on the part of the petitioner undoubtedly

continues.

The Court will have to give regard to wider equitable considerations

including the conduct of the petitioner in deciding the matter. In that

context, creating a conflict by seeking to purchase a competing

company (Grace v. Biagioli [2006] 2 BCLC 70), manifestly improper

conduct (Waldron v. Waldron [2019] EWHC 115 (Ch)), acquiescence in

the improper management of the company without protest (Re RA Noble

and Sons Clothing Ltd (supra), delay in initiating proceedings (Re Jermyn

St Turkish Baths Ltd [1971] 3 All ER 184) etc. are relevant factors.

32

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

The jurisdiction of the Court shall not be invoked for collateral

purposes. In Re Bellador Silk Ltd [1965] 1 All ER 667 at 672, Plowman J.

dismissed the application stating:

A petition which is launched not with the genuine object of

obtaining the relief claimed, but with the object of exerting pressure

in order to achieve a collateral purpose [to get repayment of a loan

owed by the company to the petitioners group of companies] is, in

my judgment, an abuse of the process of the court.

On the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I do not think the

High Court exercised its discretion arbitrarily in dismissing the

application of the petitioner. In particular, the petitioners forming up a

new competing company together with his spouse militates against him

in seeking discretionary relief.

Shareholders agreement and the Duomatic principle

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner does not seem to be

contesting the fundamental principles of company law outlined above.

Nevertheless, he strenuously submits that the shareholders agreement

X11 has the potential to amend or supersede the articles of the

company, relying on the Duomatic principle elucidated in Re Duomatic

Ltd [1969] 1 All ER 161, further elaborated upon in Cane v. Jones

[1981] 1 All ER 533, and consistently applied in recent cases, such as

EIC Services Ltd v. Phipps [2003] EWHC 1507 (Ch). This constitutes the

pivotal argument presented by learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner.

The Duomatic principle recognises that unanimous consent or

acquiescence among the relevant shareholders can serve as a valid

substitute for formal approval at a general meeting, provided that all

parties are informed and act in a manner consistent with the proposed

33

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

action. Such informal yet informed consent holds binding force on the

parties involved. This principle serves the interests of equity and

efficiency in closely-held companies or situations where adherence to

formal procedures may be impractical.

In Re Duomatic Ltd (supra) at 168 Buckley J. formulated the principle in

the following manner:

[W]here it can be shown that all shareholders who have a right to

attend and vote at a general meeting of the company assent to

some matter which a general meeting of the company could carry

into effect, that assent is as binding as a resolution in general

meeting would be.

In EIC Services Ltd v. Phipps [2003] EWHC 1507 at paragraph 122,

Neuberger J. lucidly spelled out the nature of the Duomatic principle in

the following terms:

Although the principle has been characterised in somewhat

different ways in different cases, I do not consider that that is

because its nature or extent is in doubt or the subject of debate.

The difference in language is attributable to the fact that the

principle will have been expressed by reference to the particular

facts of the case. The essence of the Duomatic principle, as I see it,

is that, where the articles of a company require a course to be

approved by a group of shareholders at a general meeting, that

requirement can be avoided if all members of the group, being

aware of the relevant facts, either give their approval to that

course, or so conduct themselves as to make it inequitable for them

to deny that they have given their approval. Whether the approval

is given in advance or after the event, whether it is characterised

as agreement, ratification, waiver, or estoppel, and whether

34

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

members of the group give their consent in different ways at

different times, does not matter.

This illustrates that the Duomatic principle is not bound by formalities.

As noted by Neuberger J., approval can take various forms, including

express or implied consent, given in advance or after the event, or

through different means at different times. It is not obligatory for assent

to be in written form as long as it is conveyed through other means.

Similarly, when a shareholder wishes to withdraw his assent, the same

principle should apply, and the revocation of assent does not require

formalities as long as it is clearly manifested.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner admits that the

Companies Act of 1982 which was the applicable law at the time of

signing X11 did not contain any express provision on the effect of

shareholders agreements on the articles of the company. However he

contends that this lacuna was filled by section 31(a) of the new

Companies Act of 2007 and, as the 1st respondent company was re-

registered under the new Companies Act, the Court can make use of

that section to grant relief to the petitioner.

The impugned final order of the Commercial High Court was delivered

in 2003. The new Companies Act was enacted in 2007. Hence

consideration of the new Companies Act in this final appeal filed against

the said order does not arise. Nevertheless, I will consider this

argument since it is an important question of law.

Section 31(1) of the new Companies Act of 2007 reads:

Where all the shareholders of a private company agree in writing to

any action which has been taken, or is to be taken by the company

35

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

(a) the taking of that action is deemed to be validly authorised by the

company, notwithstanding any provision in the articles of the

company to the contrary; and

(b) the provisions contained in the list of sections of this Act specified

in the Second Schedule hereto, shall not apply to and in relation to

that action.

In accordance with section 31(1)(b), shareholders of a private company

cannot unilaterally decide on any action outside the scope of the

companys articles. However, it is essential to note that there are certain

limitations to this authority. Shareholders are restricted from making

decisions on matters that are specifically listed under the second

schedule to the Act.

Be that as it may, in terms of section 530(1)(a) of the Companies Act of

2007, all agreements made under the repealed Companies Act of 1982

will not continue to be in force under the new Companies Act of 2007

but will continue only the agreements which were in force on the

appointed date of the new Act. It reads as follows:

Without prejudice to the provisions contained in sections 5 and 10

of the Interpretation Ordinance nothing in the repeal of any

former written law relating to companies shall affect any order,

rule, regulation, scale of fees, appointment, conveyance, mortgage,

deed or agreement made, resolution passed, direction given,

proceeding taken, instrument issued or thing done under any

former written law relating to companies, but any such order, rule,

regulation, scale of fees, appointment, conveyance, mortgage, deed

or agreement, resolution, direction, proceeding, instrument or thing

shall, if in force on the appointed date, continue to be in force, and

so far as it could have been made, passed, given, taken, issued or

36

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

done under this Act, shall have effect as if made, passed, given,

taken, issued, or done under the provisions of this Act.

Was the agreement X11 in force when the new Companies Act of 2007

became law? In my judgment, it was not. The petitioner knew this

when he filed the application in the Commercial High Court where he

said in paragraph 17 of the petition:

The petitioner states that in any event, in terms of the

shareholders agreement marked X11 the 2nd and 3rd respondents

cannot take control of the 1st respondent company or its finances or

oust the petitioner from its board of directors or the post of Chief

Executive Officer without first referring the disputes to arbitration.

However in X18(e) the said respondents have denied they are

bound by X11 and therefore the petitioner verily believes that the

said respondents would not agree to proceed to arbitration.

The petitioner acknowledges that the 2nd respondent denies X11 and he

(the petitioner) acquiesces to this denial. If the petitioner considered

X11 a binding agreement, he could not have in the first place filed this

application in the Commercial High Court without referring the dispute

to arbitration. The petitioner cannot approbate and reprobate, blow hot

and cold.

The position of the petitioner in his first written submissions that The

2nd and 3rd respondents however attempt to distance themselves from

X11 stating that they were compelled to sign same. Whatever may be the

positions of the parties, but the X11 remains a binding and valid

agreement in law and moreover signing of it was admitted by the

respondents is untenable.

37

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

A shareholders agreement entered into outside the articles of

association is binding on the parties so long as the parties agree to it.

The parties to a shareholders agreement are at liberty to withdraw from

it. Kanag-Isvaran and Wijayawardana, op. cit., p.90 state:

Another new provision that has been introduced under the Act of

2007 enables private companies to validate any action that has

been taken, or is to be taken, by the company, where all its

shareholders, by unanimous agreement in writing, agree to such

an act, notwithstanding that it is contrary to the articles. (Section

31(1)(a) of the Act) The purpose behind introducing this concept of

unanimous agreement of shareholders is to allow a private

company to undertake certain actions otherwise than in

accordance with the formalities prescribed in the articles in the

company, if all its shareholders concur in writing to carry out that

act. Such written agreement may be entered into for a particular

use of a power, or to approve the exercise of a power generally, or

an ongoing basis. Though the Act is silent as to the consequences

of the withdrawal of the consent given by a shareholder, it can be

affirmatively presumed that a shareholder is entitled to withdraw

his consent after giving same, in which event section 31 would

have no application.

This appeal is for all practical purposes predicated on the shareholders

agreement X11. Learned Presidents Counsel begins Part A of the

further written submissions the appellant relies on the X11

shareholders agreement to establish the oppressive conduct and

mismanagement by the 2nd and 3rd respondents-respondents and ends

Part A the appellants grievance of oppression and mismanagement

arose from the respondents deliberate violation of X11 in conducting

affairs of the company. In other words, on the facts of this case, if there

38

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

is no valid shareholders agreement, there is no oppression and

mismanagement. X11 is unenforceable in law.

Resignation from the board and the petitioners new claim

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner in the further written

submissions states that although the respondents move to oust the

petitioner was unsuccessful in view of this application the appellant

subsequently had to resign from board in 2003 as he was unwilling to

share the liability for the respondents unilateral acts based on majority

which was contrary to X11. According to the document filed with the

written submissions, the petitioner resigned from the office of director

on 20.03.2003 even before the Commercial High Court delivered its

final order. For reasons best known to him, the petitioner did not

inform this to the Commercial High Court.

Learned Presidents Counsel suggests that the most viable solution

seems to be the 2nd respondent purchasing the petitioners shares at a

fair value through a Court-supervised process, thereby enabling the

petitioner to exit from the 1st respondent company. If this was indeed

the petitioners intention, he could have brought it to the attention of

the Commercial High Court. Even though he resigned from the position

of director while the action was pending, he continued to seek relief

against the 2nd and 3rd respondents to prevent his removal from the

directorship.

The petitioner shall understand that this is a final appeal filed against

the final order of the Commercial High Court and not a revision

application. In this appeal, the Court will consider whether the order of

the Commercial High Court is right or wrong. The petitioner cannot

seek different reliefs on appeal.

Additional submissions

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

At the argument, it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the

learned High Court Judge was in error when he stated in the impugned

order that the petitioner did not file a counter affidavit refuting the

allegations contained in the statement of objections which amounts to

the allegations remaining unchallenged. It was submitted that the

counter affidavit of the petitioner is found at page 328 of the brief. This

submission is not correct. That is not the counter affidavit filed against

the statement of objections to the substantive application but against

the application filed by the respondents to vacate the interim orders

issued against them ex parte. The respondents filed a statement of

objections against the substantive reliefs (page 787 of the brief) and a

separate application praying for vacation of the ex parte interim orders

(page 983 of the brief).

Another submission made on behalf of the petitioner was that the 3rd

respondent who filed the affidavit in support of the averments in the

statement of objections did not have personal knowledge to affirm to the

facts contained therein. In the aforesaid counter affidavit tendered for a

different purpose, the petitioner says Therefore the 3rd respondent had

no personal knowledge whatsoever of many statements in her affidavit in

respect of the period prior to March 1998. As I have already stated, the

1st respondent company was incorporated on 20.03.1998 and the 3rd

respondent who is a daughter of the 2nd respondent was made a

director of the company on the same day. What holds significance in

this application is the events that occurred after the companys

incorporation. Therefore, even if the 3rd respondent lacks personal

knowledge regarding matters preceding the incorporation, it does not

impact the respondents case.

Conclusion

40

SC/CHC/APPEAL/26/2003

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the Commercial High

Court was correct to have held that no cause of action accrued to the

petitioner to sue the respondents under oppression and

mismanagement. The shareholders agreement X11, heavily relied

upon by the petitioner, is unenforceable in law.

I see no reason to interfere with the order of the Commercial High Court

dated 07.05.2003. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
