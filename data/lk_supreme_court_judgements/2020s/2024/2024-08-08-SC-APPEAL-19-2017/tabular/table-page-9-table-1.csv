"I am in agreement with this exposition of the law. Nevertheless, as Chitty states (supra),"
"in such cases it will be necessary to prove what statements or stipulations were intended"
"to be incorporated as terms of the contract to have contractual effect. Where the written"
"contract  between  parties  contains  terms  which  runs  contrary  to  the  alleged  implied"
"terms, the written contract must take precedence."
"For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the two questions of law in the affirmative."
"The judgment of the High Court dated 18.01.2016 is set aside. The judgment of the District"
"Court dated 18.03.2011 is affirmed."
"The Appellant shall be entitled to costs both in the High Court and in this Court."
"Appeal allowed with costs."
