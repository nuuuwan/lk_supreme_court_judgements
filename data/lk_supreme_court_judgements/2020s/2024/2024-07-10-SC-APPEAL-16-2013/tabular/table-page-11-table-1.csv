"Defendant-Respondent had sold her remaining ½ share to Mahindaratne. Therefore, the"
"District Court was correct in holding that the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant had title to Lot 1"
"and was also in possession of Lot 2 of the said plan."
"The Plaintiffs-Appellants as co-owners of the larger land, which is not in dispute, filed"
"this action seeking a declaration of title and ejectment of the Defendants-Respondents"
"from the potion of land more fully described in the 2nd schedule, which is Lot 1 of Plan"
"No.  5817.  The  said  portion  of  land  is  presently  in  the  possession  of  the  Defendant-"
"Respondents. When the Plaintiffs-Appellants have prima facie established in evidence"
"of ownership for the portion of land they claim for a declaration of title, then it is for"
"the Defendants-Respondents to prove better title."
"The only substantive defence taken before the trial court by Manikhamy was that she"
"executed Deed No. 1632 in favour of Edmond Dissanayake, not with the intention of"
"alienating the property in question but merely as a security for a loan of Rupees 17,000/-"
"obtained  by  her  from  the  said  Edmond  Dissanayake.  Therefore,  the  1st  Defendant-"
"Respondent’s claim to the disputed land was only on the basis of a constructive trust to"
"her benefit."
"The Plaintiffs-Appellants' position is that the 1st Defendant-Respondent extinguished"
"all her undivided rights to Lots 1 and 2, nevertheless deprived the Plaintiffs-Appellants"
"of their right to possess the land to which they have title.  As a sole co-owner of the"
"disputed land and premises, the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant is entitled to maintain an action"
"to sue a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment.1 Therefore, the Plaintiffs-"
"Appellants  being  co-owners  of  the  larger  land  are  entitled  to  sue  and  eject  the"
"Defendants-Respondents, who are trespassers not having paper title, prescriptive or any"
"other rights against the Plaintiffs-Appellants."
