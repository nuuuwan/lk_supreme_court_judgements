"No. 5817, hence, there is no undivided land within the subject matter, owned by the 1st"
"Defendant-Respondent."
"Witness Edmand Dissanayake stated that he transferred a divided ½ share depicted as"
"Lot No. 1 in Plan 5817 dated 17/02/1986, morefully described in the 2nd schedule to"
"Mahindaratne, the husband of the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant. Witness further states that, the"
"1st Defendant-Respondent is in occupation of the house located in the said Lot 1. It was"
"his evidence that presently the Plaintiffs-Appellants are in Lot No. 2 of the said plan."

"The said Manikhamy did not challenge the boundaries and/or the demarcation of limits"
"of the said undivided ½ share of 3/24 share of the land depicted as Lot No. 1 in Plan"
"No. 5817 (P17), or the said Deed No. 1632, at the trial before the District Court. It is"
"also significant to note that, Manikhamy at no stage in this action claimed to be a co-"
"owner of the larger land and rightly, this action is not foundered on that basis."
"Therefore, there is no basis for the Civil Appeal High Court to have come to a definite"
