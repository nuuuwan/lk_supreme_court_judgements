"Thus, it is on the basis of Marimuttu’s possession on the ground that the said land came"
"to be demarcated as Lot No. 19 having an extent of 5A 2R 8P. The allocation of extra land"
"is not a mistake on the part of any officer. This is also the explanation for the increase of"
"the  extent  of  land  in  P1  over  and  above  what  was  given  initially  by  the  permit  to"
"Marimuttu. The fact that Marimuttu was in possession in 1970 of the entire land of 5A 2R"
"8P rebuts the position of the Defendant that the land referred to in lots G and H is the"
"land given to his father in 1965 and which land the Defendants claim they have enjoyed"
"since  then. Furthermore,  if  the  Defendant and/or his father  were  in  possession  of the"
"impugned  land  [i.e.  what  has  now  been  identified  as  lots  G  and  H],  P6  would  have"
"reflected their presence. Not only was the impugned land [lots G and H] not demarcated"
"as a separate lot, P7 which is the Tenement List attached to P6 has no reference at all to"
"the Defendant’s father."
