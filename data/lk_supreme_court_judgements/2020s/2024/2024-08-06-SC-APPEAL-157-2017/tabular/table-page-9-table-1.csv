he  Plaintiff  states  that  due  to  the  situation  that  prevailed  in  the  area  from  1983,  his"
"father  and  he  had  not  been  in  occupation  of  the  said  land  at  all  times,  only  for  the"
"Defendant and two others to encroach upon the said land and occupy parts of the land"
"given by P1 during their absence. The evidence bears out that the Plaintiff had brought"
"this  to  the  attention  of  the  officers  attached  to  the  office  of  the  relevant  Divisional"
"Secretary in the late 1980â€™s. Having returned to the said land at the end of the hostilities,"
"the Plaintiff instituted three cases in the District Court against the said persons, including"
"this case against the Defendant seeking a declaration of title in respect of Lot No. 19 in P6"
"and to eject the Defendant from the land referred to in paragraph (b) of the schedule to"
"the plaint in extent of 3R 8P, which the Plaintiff claimed formed part of the land referred"

"T
he case of the Defendant"
"T
he Defendant is the son of D. M. Thegis Appu. The Defendant states that the State had"
"issued his father permit No. 354/272 dated 1st April 1965 [V1] in respect of a land situated"
"in Polonnaruwa in extent of 1 acre. Similar to the permit issued to Marimuttu, V1 too does"
"not contain any reference to a survey plan. V1 however refers to three of the boundaries"
"of the land referred to therein. Upon the death of Thegis, the name of the Defendant had"
"been registered as the permit holder [V2]. The position of the Defendant was twofold."
"The first and foremost was that the land that he and his family are in occupation is the"
"land referred to in the permit V1 and therefore he has good title to such land possessed"
"by him. The second was that he had neither encroached upon nor was he in possession"
"of  any  part  of  the  land  referred  to  in  P1.  In  other  words,  it  was  the  position  of  the"
"Defendant that the land referred to in paragraph (b) of the schedule to the plaint is the"
"subject matter of the permit issued to his father and later to him and importantly does"
"not form part of the land given to the Plaintiff by P1. The Defendant had stated further"
"that  he  has  developed  the  land  that  he  is  in  possession  of  and  constructed  houses"
"thereon, and that he is entitled for compensation in the event the District Court holds"
"that he is in possession of the land referred to in P1."
