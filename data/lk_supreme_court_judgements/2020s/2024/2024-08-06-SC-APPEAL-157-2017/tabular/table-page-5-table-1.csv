he second is the judgment in Pathirana v Jayasundera [58 NLR 169] where, Gratiaen J."
"declared [at page 172] that,  “In a rei  vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable"
"property is entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery of the"
"property  and  for  the  ejectment  of  the  person  in  wrongful  occupation.  ‘The  plaintiff’s"
"ownership of the thing is of the very essence of the action.’ Maasdorp’s Institutes (7th Ed.)"
