"amayawardhena, J has also referred to the judgment in the South African case of De Vos"
"v Adams and Others [(2016) ZAWCHC 202] where Davis, J had stated as follows:"
"“Turning specifically to the rei vindicatio it is clear that there are three requirements"
"which the owner must prove on a balance of probabilities, in order to succeed with"
"the  particular action.  Firstly,  the applicant must  show  his  or her ownership  in  the"
"property. In the case of immovable property it is sufficient as a result to show the"
"title in the land is registered in his or her name. Secondly, the property must exist, be"
"clearly  identifiable  and  must  not  have  been  destroyed  or  consumed.  Thirdly,  the"
"defendant must be in possession or detention of the property at the time that the"
"action is instituted.”"
