"Aggrieved, the Plaintiff filed an appeal before the High Court. The  Defendant however"
"chose not to prefer an appeal probably for the reason that the District Court judgment"
"enabled him to continue to be in possession of the said land without any hindrance. By"
"its judgment delivered on 13th September 2019, the High Court took the view that while"
"the Plaintiff had failed to establish his title to the land referred to in paragraph (b) of the"
"schedule to the plaint, the Defendant has established his entitlement to the impugned"
"land and on that  basis set aside the judgment of the District Court in its entirety."
