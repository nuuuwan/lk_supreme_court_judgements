"(b)
if
the opposing party objects or has objected to it being received as"
"evidence, the court may decide whether it is necessary or it was necessary"

case may

their mother

has
admitted
that
their mother
Velupillai
Thanagaratnam"

the"
"English Translation of
the District Court proceedings). The Appellant has"
"denied the document marked V4 stating that she never signed the said"
"document and the signature appearing is a forged signature. Nevertheless,"
"the Appellant has submitted a document marked
4 to the District Court"
