"The
counsel
for
the
Appellant
contends
that
the
above mentioned"
"documents marked V3 and V4 are fraudulent. The learned counsel states"
"that
the signature of
the mother in the Dowry Deed No. 22 is different to"
"that
in V3 and when the Respondent was cross examined on the alleged"
"forgery
of
V3
he
claimed
that
he
cannot
read.
Nevertheless,
the"
"Respondent has
thereafter
read and answered questions
regarding
the"
"document marked V4.
(page 71 of
the English Translation of
the District"
"Court proceedings) Furthermore,
the Appellant states that she has never"
"signed the document marked V4 as
there was no necessity
for her
to"
"obtain permission from any person to stay at her home where she had"
"lived since birth and the
signature
in the
said document
shows as
‘S."
"Ranjithamalar’ when she usually signs as ‘A.Ranjithamalar’.
(page 70 and"
"89 of the English Translation of the District Court proceedings)"
"However,
the
Appellant’s
counsel
has
failed
to
reiterate
the
aforesaid"
"objections to the documents marked V3 and V4 when the Respondent’s"
"counsel
closed his
case
at
the District Court.
(page 75 of
the English"
"Translation of the District Court proceedings) Hence, the principal
issue in"
"this
case
is whether
the
said two documents
should be
considered as"
"proved by the Respondent although these documents were not objected by"
"the Appellant’s counsel at the close of the case of the Respondent."
"The
accepted
position
in
this
regard
is
the
principle
enunciated
by"
"Samarakoon,
C.J.,
in
Sri
Lanka
Ports
Authority
and
another
v."
