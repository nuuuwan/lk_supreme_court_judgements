"The
above decision was
followed by
the Supreme Court
in the
case of"
"Balapitiya Gunananda Thero Vs. Thalalle Methananda Thero [1997]"
"2 Sri L.R 101 which stated at page 101 that,"
"“Where a document
is admitted subject
to proof but when tendered"
"and read in evidence at
the close of
the case is accepted without"
"objection, it becomes evidence in the case. This is the cursus curiae.”"
"Nevertheless,
the counsel
for the Appellant
in the present case has relied"
"on
the
case
of Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe Vs. Dadallage"
"Mervin Silva and Mohamed Rosaid Misthihar [SC Appeal 45/2010] SC"
"Minutes
of
11.06.2019
where
the
counsel
for
the
1st"
"Defendant-Appellant failed to object to a deed at the close of the case when"
"that
deed
was
not
proved
according
to
Section
68
of
the
Evidence"
"Ordinance."
"In this case, Sisira J de Abrew J at page 6 stated that,"
"“If
the principle enunciated in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and"
"Another Vs Jugolinja Boal-East
(supra)
is accepted in respect of deeds, even"
"a fraudulent deed marked subject
to proof can be used as evidence if
it
is"
"not objected by the opposing party at
the close of
the case of
the party"
"which produced it. In such a situation, one can argue that courts will have to"
"disregard section 68 of
the Evidence Ordinance.
I do not
think that
the"
"principle enunciated in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another Vs"
"Jugolinja
Boal-East
(supra)
extends
to
such
a
situation. Whether
the"
"opposing party takes up an objection or not
to a deed which is sought to be"
"produced, the courts will have to follow the procedure laid down in law.”"
