This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of the Eastern

Province (Holden in Batticaloa) dated 15.03.2018 which set aside the

judgmentoftheDistrictCourtofBatticaloa,casebearingNo:L/

5570/2011 dated 03.02.2016.

ThePlaintiff-Appellant-Respondent(hereinafterreferredtoasthe

Respondent) instituted the initial action before the District Court of

BatticaloabyPlaintdated08.11.2011againstthe

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant(hereinafterreferredtoasthe

Appellant) after which an amended plaint was filed on 30.05.2012

seeking a declaration that the Respondent is the owner of the land

described in the schedule B to the Plaint, an order to eject the Defendants

from the subject land and claimed compensation and costs until the

Defendant has handed over vacant and peaceful possession of the land

morefully described in the schedule B to the Plaint. The Appellant sought

the dismissal of the Respondents action and claimed prescriptive title to

the property.

3

After the conclusion of the trial, the District Court delivered the Judgment

on 03.02.2016 in favour of the Appellant on the ground that she has

become entitled to the land in dispute by way of prescription under

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Aggrieved by the said decision,

the Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Eastern

Province (Holden in Batticaloa). On 15.03.2018 the learned High Court

Judge set aside the judgment of the District Court on the basis that the

learned District Court judge has failed to attribute proper evidentiary

value to the testimony of Defendant and has come to erroneous findings of

fact which if allowed to stand would cause a gross miscarriage of justice to

the Respondent.

The Appellant is before this Court challenging the said Judgment. This

Court by Order dated 23.07.2019 granted Leave to Appeal on the following

question of law.

Did the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province Holden in

Batticaloa erred in law by holding that the deeds marked V1, V2 and V3

were proved by the Plaintiff?

My analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid question

of law based on which leave was granted.

The Respondent and the Appellant are brother and sister and their mother

one,VelupillaiThanagaratnam(deceased)byDeedNo.22dated

30.11.1984 attested by S.Sooriyakumar Notary Public, has gifted the

property described in schedule A to the amended answer to the Appellant

4

and her husband one, Arumugam Chandrasegaran as dowry. Thereafter,

the Appellant and her husband transferred the same to one, Mylvaganam

Thillaiyampalam by Deed of Transfer No. 23847 (Deed marked V1) dated

16.08.1989 attested by S.Kandappan Notary Public as collateral for a loan

of Rs. 50 000.00. The Appellant and her husband were unable to repay the

said loan and the interest accrued.

Thereafter, the said Mylvaganam Thillaiyampalam recovered the amount

due to him and transferred the excess portion of land described in

scheduleBtotheamendedanswertoVelupillaiThanagaratnam

(deceased) the mother of the Appellant and Respondent by Deed of

TransferNo.177(DeedmarkedV2)dated01.-7.1995attestedby

E.Kandasamy Notary Public.

The above two deeds are not disputed by the Appellant. Further, the

parties are in agreement with regard to the identity of the property which

has been described correctly in Schedule B to the Amended Plaint and

Schedule C to the Amended Answer.

The crux of the matter is the Deed of Gift No.5586 (Deed marked V3) dated

07.06.2006 attested by M. Gunasekaram Notary Public. According to the

Respondent, the mother, Velupillai Thanagaratnam (deceased) transferred

the property in question to him by the said deed. The Respondent has

furthersubmittedadocumentmarkedV4whichis a letter dated

01.01.2011 allegedly written by the Appellant requesting permission of the

Respondent to reside in the property in dispute for a period of six months

from 01.01.2011 to 01.06.2011.

5

ThecounselfortheAppellantcontendsthattheabovementioned

documents marked V3 and V4 are fraudulent. The learned counsel states

that the signature of the mother in the Dowry Deed No. 22 is different to

that in V3 and when the Respondent was cross examined on the alleged

forgeryofV3heclaimedthathecannotread.Nevertheless,the

Respondent has thereafter read and answered questions regarding the

document marked V4. (page 71 of the English Translation of the District

Court proceedings) Furthermore, the Appellant states that she has never

signed the document marked V4 as there was no necessity for her to

obtain permission from any person to stay at her home where she had

lived since birth and the signature in the said document shows as S.

Ranjithamalar when she usually signs as A.Ranjithamalar. (page 70 and

89 of the English Translation of the District Court proceedings)

However, the Appellants counsel has failed to reiterate the aforesaid

objections to the documents marked V3 and V4 when the Respondents

counsel closed his case at the District Court. (page 75 of the English

Translation of the District Court proceedings) Hence, the principal issue in

this case is whether the said two documents should be considered as

proved by the Respondent although these documents were not objected by

the Appellants counsel at the close of the case of the Respondent.

The accepted position in this regard is the principle enunciated by

Samarakoon, C.J.,inSriLankaPortsAuthorityand another v.

Jugolinija Boal east (1981) 1 Sri L.R 18, at page 24,

If no objection is taken when at the close of a case documents

are read in evidence they are evidence for all purposes of the law..

6

The above decision was followed by the Supreme Court in the case of

Balapitiya Gunananda Thero Vs. Thalalle Methananda Thero [1997]

2 Sri L.R 101 which stated at page 101 that,

Where a document is admitted subject to proof but when tendered

and read in evidence at the close of the case is accepted without

objection, it becomes evidence in the case. This is the cursus curiae.

Nevertheless, the counsel for the Appellant in the present case has relied

on the case of Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe Vs. Dadallage

Mervin Silva and Mohamed Rosaid Misthihar [SC Appeal 45/2010] SC

Minutesof11.06.2019wherethecounselforthe1st

Defendant-Appellant failed to object to a deed at the close of the case when

that deed was not proved according to Section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

In this case, Sisira J de Abrew J at page 6 stated that,

If the principle enunciated in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and

Another Vs Jugolinja Boal-East (supra) is accepted in respect of deeds, even

a fraudulent deed marked subject to proof can be used as evidence if it is

not objected by the opposing party at the close of the case of the party

which produced it. In such a situation, one can argue that courts will have to

disregard section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. I do not think that the

principle enunciated in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another Vs

Jugolinja Boal-East (supra) extends to such a situation. Whether the

opposing party takes up an objection or not to a deed which is sought to be

produced, the courts will have to follow the procedure laid down in law.

7

The Appellant in the present case states that the deed marked V3 must be

considered as not proved in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance

as no attesting witness was called in the District Court to prove the said

deed.

However, I must highlight that a new amendment has been introduced to

section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code by the Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act, No.17 of 2022 on 23rd June 2022 and the position

oftheaforementionedcasehasnowbeenovertakenbythisnew

amendment.

Transitional Provision in Section 3 of the said amendment states as

follows,

Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 of this Act, and the

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, in any case or appeal pending

on the date of coming into operation of this Act

(a)

(i) if the opposing party does not object or has not objected to it

being received as evidence on the deed or document being

tendered in evidence; or

(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as

evidenceonthedeedordocumentbeing tendered in

evidence but not objected at the close of a case when such

document is read in evidence, the court shall admit such

deed or document as evidence without requiring further

proof;

8

(b) if the opposing party objects or has objected to it being received as

evidence, the court may decide whether it is necessary or it was necessary

asthecasemaybe,toadduceformalproofoftheexecutionor

genuineness of any such deed or document considering the merits of the

objections taken with regard to the execution or genuineness of such deed

or document.

The counsel for the Appellant has relied on Section 3 (b) of the above cited

amendment to state that this court may decide it was necessary to adduce

formal proof of execution of the deed marked V3 and in the absence of

such, the case of the Appellant must succeed.

However, I am of the view that the section of the new amendment that is

applicable to the present case is Section 3 (a) (ii) as the Appellants counsel

failed to reiterate his objections at the end of the Respondents case even

thoughheobjectedtothesaiddeedmarkedV3duringthe

cross-examination.

In the present case, the Appellant has disputed the Deed marked V3 on

thegroundthat their mother has signed on the said deed as V.

Thangaretnam when she usually signs as A.Thangeratnam. However, the

Appellanthasadmittedthattheirmother Velupillai Thanagaratnam

(deceased) was also known as Arumugam Thangeratnam (page 80 of the

English Translation of the District Court proceedings). The Appellant has

denied the document marked V4 stating that she never signed the said

document and the signature appearing is a forged signature. Nevertheless,

the Appellant has submitted a document marked 4 to the District Court

9

to prove her prescriptive title and the comparison of the Appellants

signature in that document with the alleged forged signature in V4 proves

that the signatures belong to the same person which is the Appellant.

However, I am of the opinion that there is no necessity to discuss the

genuineness of the said documents as these documents have to be

considered as admitted as evidence without requiring further proof under

Transitional Provision in Section 3 (a) (ii) of the Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act, No.17 of 2022. On this basis, I decide the question of

law in the present case in negative.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, the appeal is hereby

dismissed without costs.
