"Where a document is relevant and admissible and its authenticity is admitted by the"
"other party the document can be marked without subject to proof. However, where"
"the authenticity of such document is challenged by the opposing party, the document"
"can  be  allowed  to  be  marked  subject  to  its  authenticity  being  proved  by  the  party"
"seeking to tender it in evidence.  However, the trial judge must inquire from the party"
"that is moving that the document be marked subject to proof, as to whether it is the"
"authenticity or mode of proof that is in issue and record it."
"Having set out the applicable evidentiary principles, let me examine their application"
"to the facts and circumstances of this case under each of the questions of law on which"
"leave was granted."
"Question of Law No. 1"
"The  question  is  whether  the  High  Court  erred  by  failing  to  properly  consider  the"
"provisions of Sections 61 and 62 of the Evidence Ordinance. The contention is that the"
"best evidence has been produced in terms of Section 62 of the Evidence Ordinance"
"since the Appellant has produced the originals of the purchase orders forwarded by"
"the Respondent. Therefore, these documents cannot be marked subject to proof as"
"there is no possibility on the part of the Appellant to adduce further evidence of the"
"said documents."
"This contention is based on a misconception of the applicable evidentiary principles."
"According to Section 61 of the Evidence Ordinance, the contents of documents may be"
"proved  either  by  primary  or  secondary  evidence.  Section  62  explains  that  primary"
"evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the court."
"These provisions deal with the mode of proof of the contents of documents. However,"
"the issue before the trial judge was whether the purchase orders should be marked"
"subject to proof. Although the record is silent on the basis for this request, it is clear"
"that it was based on the need to prove authenticity."
