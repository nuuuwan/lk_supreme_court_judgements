"Samayawardhena, J., enriched by his wealth of experience as a trial judge, perceptively"
"observed that:"
"“There is a practice among some lawyers to get up and say ""subject to proof'"
"whenever a document is marked in evidence by the other party. This they do as"
"a matter of course or as a matter of routine and not with any particular objective"
"in mind, except perhaps to prolong the trial. It is regrettable that most of the"
"time the party who produces the document obliges to this without a murmur. If"
"we  are  serious  about  law's  delays,  we  must  put  an  end  to  this  bad  practice."
"When a counsel routinely says ""subject to proof', the Judge must ask what he"
"wants the other party to prove in the document. If this simple question is asked,"
"I  am  certain  the  objection  would  be  withdrawn  or  at  least  the  issue  to  be"
"addressed would be narrowed down.”"
