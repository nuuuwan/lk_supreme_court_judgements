"Accordingly, the first matter that a trial judge must address when a document is sought"
"to  be  marked  in  evidence  is  whether  it  provides  evidence  of  the  existence  or  non-"
"existence of any fact in issue or a relevant fact. Where the answer is in the negative,"
"the document cannot be allowed to be marked in evidence, even subject to proof, and"
"the questions of authenticity or admissibility does not arise for consideration."
"Where the answer is in the affirmative, the next question is its admissibility."
"Admissibility"
"Admissibility is a question of law. Although the word admissibility is not defined in the"
"Evidence  Ordinance,  it  is  referred  to  in  at  least  two  sections.  Sections  65  and  91"
"identifies certain categories of documentary evidence which are admissible."
"According to Coomaraswamy [E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Vol. I"
"(Stamford Lake Publication, 2022), page 64] admissibility is a negative concept and is"
"exclusively legal. It implies that the law has laid down rules of exclusion according to"
"which  evidence  cannot  be  received  even  though  it  is  both  material  and  relevant."
"Evidence is inadmissible if it is rejected for some reason other than immateriality or"
"irrelevance. It is admissible if there is no rule for its rejection other than a rule dealing"
"with materiality or relevance. “Admissibility” here means the concept of the absence of"
"an applicable rule for exclusion."
"There is a distinction between admissibility and relevancy. In terms of Section 5 of the"
"Evidence Ordinance, evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence"
"or non-existence of every fact in issue, and of relevant facts and of no others. Sections"
"6  to  55  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  identifies  different  categories  of  relevant  facts."
"Nevertheless, there may be rules of exclusion which exclude evidence of such facts in"
"issue  or  relevant  facts.  Thus,  the  terms  relevancy  and  admissibility  are  not  co-"
"extensive."
