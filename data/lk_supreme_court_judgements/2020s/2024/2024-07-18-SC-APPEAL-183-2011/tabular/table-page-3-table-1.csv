"Decided on:   18.07.2024"
"Janak De Silva, J."
"The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (“Appellant”) instituted the above styled action to"
"recover a sum of Rs. 1,722,724/19 and interest thereon from the Defendant-Petitioner-"
"Respondent (“Respondent”). According to the plaint, the Appellant sold raw material"
"to the Respondent which was utilised to manufacture paint. The Appellant permitted"
"the Respondent to make purchases on two (02) separate credit facilities payable within"
"30  and  60  days  respectively.  This  action  was  filed  as  the  Respondent  failed  and"
"neglected to pay the amounts due and owing to the Appellant."
"During the trial, originals of the purchase orders and the corresponding invoices were"
"marked as P15 to P50(a) by the  Appellant during the evidence-in-chief of  the Chief"
"Accountant  of  the  Appellant.  The  Respondent  objected  to  all  these  documents  and"
"moved that they be marked subject to proof."
"The  learned  Additional  District  Judge  overruled  the  objections  and  allowed  these"
"documents to be admitted in evidence without being subject to proof. The invoices"
"were allowed to be marked without being subject to proof as they were documents"
"prepared by the Appellant. The purchase orders were allowed to be marked without"
"being subject to proof as they were prepared by the Respondent."
"The Respondent appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province"
"Holden in Colombo (“High Court”).  During the hearing, the Respondent informed that"
"only the objection in relation to the purchase orders are maintained."
"The High Court held that since the Respondent had denied the alleged transactions, it"
"was possible for the Respondent, in view of Section 67 of the Evidence Ordinance, to"
"move that the documents relevant to the transaction be marked subject to proof."
