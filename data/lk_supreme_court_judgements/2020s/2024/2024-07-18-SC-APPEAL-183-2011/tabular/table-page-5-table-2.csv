"objectionable as it has a legal basis. Section 136 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as"
"“136 (1) When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may"
"ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact,"
"if proved, would be relevant; and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks"
"that the fact, if proved, would be relevant and not otherwise."
"(2) If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only"
"upon proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before"
"evidence is given of the fact first mentioned, unless the party undertakes to"
"give proof of such fact, and the court is satisfied with such undertaking."
"(3) If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being"
"first proved, the Judge may in his discretion either permit evidence of the first"
"fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given"
"of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.” (emphasis added)"
