"Civil Procedure Code"
"According to Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code,  every document or writing which"
"a party intends to use as evidence against his opponent must be formally tendered by"
"him in the course of proving his case at the time when its contents or purport are first"
"immediately spoken to by a witness."
"At  this  point,  if  the  opposing  party  does  not,  on  the  document  being  tendered  in"
"evidence, object to its being received, and if the document is not such as is forbidden"
"by law to be received in evidence, the court should admit it."
"Where no objection is taken when the document is sought to be tendered in evidence,"
"and the document is not forbidden by law to be received in evidence, any objection to"
"its receipt as evidence is deemed to have been waived. [See Kenakal v. Velupillai (2"
"N.L.R. 80); Muttuya Chetty v. Appu (4 N.L.R. 184); Silva v. Kindersly (18 N.L.R. 85);"
"Siyadoris v. Danoris (42 N.L.R. 311)]."
"However,  if  the  opposing  party  objects  to  a  document  being  admitted  in  evidence"
"when it is first tendered, commonly two questions arise for determination."
"Firstly,  whether  the  document  is  authentic,  in  other  words,  if  it  is  what  the  party"
"tendering it represents it to be, and Secondly, whether, supposing it to be authentic, it"
"constitutes  legally  admissible  evidence  as  against  the  party  who  is  sought  to  be"
"affected by it."
"It is pertinent to observe that more than 65 years ago, Basnayake, C.J. in  Mendis v."
"Paramaswami [62 N.L.R. 302 at 307] commended Section 154 and more especially its"
"explanation  to  all  Judges  of  first  instance  in  civil  proceedings.  Regrettably,  the  trial"
"judge in this matter failed to do so."
