"(2) The provisions of subsection (1), shall mutatis mutandis apply in the actions"
"on summary procedure under this Code.”. (emphasis added)"
"Where evidence of the due execution of a document is led in relation to a document"
"and  the  trial  judge  is  satisfied  upon  a  consideration  of  the  probative  value  of  the"
"evidence led, that the impugned document was in fact drawn up by the party alleged"
"to be its author, it can be said that the authenticity of such document has been proved."
"Probative value of evidence means the weight to be attached to the evidence tendered"
"and is different from admissibility of evidence. It is a question of fact that cannot be"
"regulated by a set of precise rules. As Birch J in R v Madhub Chunder [(1874) 21 WRL"
"13] held, “For weighing evidence and drawing inferences from it there can be no canon."
"Each case presents its own peculiarities and in each common sense and shrewdness"
"must  be  brought  to  bear  upon  the  facts  elicited.”  Where  the  party  producing  the"
"document fails to prove its authenticity as required in a particular case, the document"
"cannot be used in evidence."
"Invariably, there may be situations where a document is produced at the trial from the"
"custody of the person who received it. When such document is produced in evidence"
"and is objected to by the other party on the basis of authenticity, the trial judge may"
"allow the document to be marked subject to its authenticity being proved by the party"
