"According to Coomaraswamy [supra., Vol. II, Book I, page 105C]:"
"“Section 67 does not render it necessary that direct evidence of the handwriting"
"of the person who is alleged to have executed the deed must be given by some"
"person who saw the signature affixed. It merely states with reference to deeds"
"the universal rule that he who makes an allegation must prove it. No new rule is"
"laid down as to the mode of proof. The nature of proof will depend to a large"
"extent on the nature of the document. The section does not require the writer"
"of a document to be examined as a witness nor does it require the subscribing"
"witness to be produced.1” (emphasis added)"
