"Question of Law No. 3"
"The  issue  is  whether  the  High  Court  erred  by  not  considering  that  the  Appellant  is"
"unable to produce further evidence other than the best and/or primary evidence of a"
"document authored by the Respondent which was delivered to the Appellant by the"
"Respondent."
"This issue deals with the mode of proving the contents of the purchase orders. It does"
"not deal with the question of the  authenticity  of the purchase  orders. As explained"
"earlier, there are different ways of proving the authenticity of a document other than"
"by calling the author of the document. Hence, for the same reasons adumbrated in"

"Question of Law No. 4"
"The Appellant contends that the High Court failed to consider that in the event the"
"Respondent denies the authenticity of documents P15 to P50(a) when giving evidence,"
"it would be open to the Appellant to lead evidence in rebuttal. In the absence of a"
"denial by the Respondent of the authenticity of these documents raised through the"
"pleadings or issues, the High Court misdirected itself in calling upon the Appellant to"
"furnish further proof of the said documents."
"This question is premised on certain factual and legal inaccuracies. The High Court did"
"not call upon the Appellant to furnish further proof of the documents. It called upon"

"67 of the Evidence Ordinance. The High Court arrived at this conclusion after observing"
"that the Respondent had denied the impugned transaction."
"The Appellant did not by reference to individual purchase orders specify in the plaint,"
"the details of the transactions on which the sum claimed in the plaint is due and owing."
"In these circumstances, it was not possible for the Respondent to have impugned the"
"authenticity of each and every purchase order. The Respondent in his answer denied"
