"will be true. Whatever he may say against it will be false.” A party who calls his"
"adversary as his witness must expect him to be treated like any other witness.”"
"This is far from saying you cannot call the other party as a witness. It only states that if"
"you do so, one cannot ask for special treatment. The other party will be treated like"
"any other witness and nothing more nothing less."
"In Dalton Wijeratne [supra.], it was held that although Section 120 (1) of the Evidence"
"Ordinance  makes  parties  to  the  suit  competent  witnesses, 
it  certainly  does  not"
"expressly  make  them  compellable  witnesses.  It  was  further  held  that  Section  120"
"appears to imply that one party cannot compel the other party to give evidence in a"
"civil suit and that the second proviso to Section 175 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code"
"does not go beyond conferring a discretion on the court to permit a party to be called"
"as a witness despite his name not being included in the list of witnesses required to be"
"filed in terms of Section 121 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"This statement must be understood on the facts and circumstances of that case. The"
"plaintiff in a partition action was absent on the day fixed for trial but was represented"
"by  his  counsel  who  sought  the  permission  of  court  to  call  either  the  2nd  or  the  6th"
"defendant, as a witness. He stated that he was seeking to prove the pedigree by calling"
"either one of them. This was opposed by the counsel appearing for the 6th defendant."
"Thus, the question that arose for determination is whether a party to an action can be"
"compelled to testify against his will by another party to the action as his witness."
"In the present matter, the Respondent informed the High Court that he will testify. The"
"High  Court  has  stated  that 
if  the  Respondent  does  not  testify  contrary  to  this"
"undertaking, permissible presumptions may be made in terms of the law."
"I answer question of law No. 2 in the negative."
