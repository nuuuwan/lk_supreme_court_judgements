"10.  This Court carefully considered the complaint, the affidavits of the"
"respondent  in  response,  evidence  adduced  by  the  complainant,"
"submissions  made  by  the 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for  the"
"respondent, the submissions made by the learned Deputy Solicitor"
"General  as  well  as  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Bar"
"Association of Sri Lanka."
"11.  As  rightly  submitted  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,  the"
"issue  boils  down  to  whether  the  respondent  has  violated  section"
"31(17) of the Notaries Ordinance (as amended), when she attested"
"the Deeds No. 167 and No. 169."
"12.  Section  31(17)  of  the  Notaries  Ordinance  has  been  brought  into"
"effect to afford protection to the parties to a notarial instrument in"
"order  to  safeguard  their  rights  and 
interests.  Every  notary 
is"
"expected to carry out a search in the land registry as stipulated in"
"section  31(17)  subject  to  the  proviso  to  the  section.  The  parties"
"executing a notarial instrument relies on the notary to carry out his"
"or  her  duties  effectively.  Therefore,  the  notary  is  placed  with  a"
"certain  responsibility  on  this  regard.  The  standard  expected  of  a"
"notary  by  the  general  public  is  even  higher  where  the  notary  in"
"question is also an Attorney-at-law. Hence, a notary who is also an"
"Attorney-at-law is expected to maintain high standards and follow"
"the rules and procedure stringently."
"13.  Section  31(17)  of  the  Notaries  Ordinance  does  not  impose  any"
"obligation on the respondent Attorney-at-Law which mandates her"
"to write the words “search dispensed with” on the face of the deed."
"In deed No. 167, however, on the face of it, the notary has mentioned"
"the words “කාර්යාල පරික්ෂාවෙන් ව ාරයි”."
"14.  As mentioned before, Deed No. 167 is the deed of sale in which the"
"vendee has given written instructions to the respondent to dispense"
"with  the  search.  Therefore,  she  has  strictly  complied  with  the"
"proviso to section 31(17) of the Notaries Ordinance (as amended). In"
"both  Deeds  No.  167  and  No.  169,  the  respondent  has  rightly"
"mentioned the folios of prior registration and both deeds have been"
"duly registered. As the donee in deed No. 169 is Lankathilaka’s own"
"son who was a minor, and it has also been subject to life interest as"
"mentioned  before,  it  is  obvious  that  the  respondent  had  all  the"
"reasons to believe that the search was dispensed with as deposed"
"by  her.  However,  admittedly,  the  respondent  has  failed  to  obtain"
"written  instructions  from  the  parties  to  dispense  with  the  search"
