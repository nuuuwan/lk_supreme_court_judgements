"","and was the son of the said Lankathilaka and was also the grandson"

"15.  Admittedly, the respondent is in the breach of section 31(17) of the",""
"","Notaries Ordinance when she failed to carry out the search in the"
"","land 
registry  or  obtain  written 
instructions 
from 
the  donee"
"","dispensing with the search when she attested deed No. 169. There"
"","is no doubt that the provisions that are stipulated in the Notaries"
"","Ordinance  are  to  be  strictly  adhered  to by  the  Notaries.  Although"
"","the respondent has failed to adhere to section 31(17) of the Notaries"
"","Ordinance, what this Court has to decide is, as to whether the above"
"","failure  by  the  respondent  amounts  to  deceit  and  or  malpractice"
"","within the ambit of section 42 of the Judicature Act read with Rule"
"","79 of Supreme Court Rules, whether the respondent has breached"
"","Rule  60  and  61  of  the  Supreme  Court  Rules  (as  referred  to  in"

"","breach  of  the  relevant  provision  of  the  Notaries  Ordinance,  the"

"","good  repute  and  competency  and  conducted  herself  in  a  manner"
"","unworthy of an Attorney-at-law."
"17.","In  the  case  of  Guneris  V.  Karunarathne  18  NLR  47  the  Notary"
"","was sued by the plaintiff for damages sustained by him by reason"
"","of  omission  on  the  part  of  the  defendant  (Notary)  to  search  for"
"","registration  of  seizures  before  drawing  a  conveyance  of  a  certain"

"","liable in damages to his client."
"18.","In  Re  Amarasinghe  Attorney-at-Law  [1981]  1  SLR  384  it  was"
"","stated 
that,  both  malpractice  or  deceit 
import  an  element  of"
"","dishonesty which was absent in this case. There was no material to"
"","show  dishonesty.  The  standard  of  proof  required  is  proof  beyond"
"","reasonable doubt."
