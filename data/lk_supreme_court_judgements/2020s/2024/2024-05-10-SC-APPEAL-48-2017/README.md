Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action on 05.06.2007 in the District Court of

Kuliyapitiya primarily seeking the cancellation of Deed No. 13951 dated

31.03.2000 and Deed No. 14883 dated 23.10.2002 executed by the

plaintiffs late father in favour of the 2nd defendant on the basis that those

Deeds were executed under undue influence and duress exerted by the

1st defendant. The defendants filed answer seeking dismissal of the

plaintiffs action inter alia on the basis that the plaintiffs cause of action

is prescribed.

After the issues were raised, learned counsel for the defendants moved

that the 15th and 16th issues raised by the defendants be tried as

preliminary questions of law.

15. Has the plaintiffs action been prescribed?

16. If so, should the action be dismissed in limine?

4

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

The learned District Judge answered these two issues in the affirmative

and dismissed the plaintiffs action in limine. On appeal, the High Court

of Civil Appeal of Kurunagala affirmed the order of the District Court. The

plaintiff appealed to this Court from the judgment of the High Court. At

the argument, learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant confined his

argument to the questions of law set out in paragraphs 12(i) and 12(iii)

of the petition.

12(i) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in holding that

the prescription begins to run from the date of execution of the

Deeds whereas it begins to run from the date on which the plaintiff

became aware of the existence of the Deeds?

12(iii) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in deciding that

the 15th and 16th issues which consist of both fact and law can be

decided without evidence being taken?

Cancellation of a Deed

Section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871, reads as

follows:

No action shall be maintainable in respect of any cause of action not

herein before expressly provided for, or expressly exempted from the

operation of this Ordinance, unless the same shall be commenced

within three years from the time when such cause of action shall

have accrued.

There is no dispute that, as held in Ranasinghe v. De Silva (1976) 78 NLR

500, An action for declaration that a notarially executed Deed is null and

void is prescribed within 3 years of the date of execution of the Deed in

terms of section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance.

5

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

However, when a plaintiff seeks cancellation of a notarially executed Deed

upon concealed fraud, it was held in Kirthisinghe v. Perera (1922) 23 NLR

279 that the three-year period begins to run not from the date of

execution of the Deed but from the time of the discovery of the fraud, or

from the time the party defrauded might by due diligence have come to

know of it. In Dodwell & Co. Ltd. v. John, both the Supreme Court (1915)

18 NLR 133 and the Privy Council (1918) 20 NLR 206 took the same view.

This exception need not be confined to fraud. The three-year period

should begin to run from the date the plaintiff becomes aware of the very

existence of the impugned Deed or from the time the plaintiff might by

due diligence have come to know of it.

For a comparable approach, fundamental rights applications can be

taken. Although the time limit of one month within which the application

shall be filed as set out in Article 126(2) is mandatory, it was held in

Siriwardena v. Brigadier Rodrigo [1986] 1 Sri LR 384 at 387 that the said

period of one month will be computed only from the date on which such

petitioner did in fact become aware of such infringement and was in a

position to take effective steps to come before this Court. This position was

reiterated in several cases including Dayaratne and Others v. National

Savings Bank and Others [2002] 3 Sri LR 116.

Section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code states If the cause of action arose

beyond the period ordinarily allowed by any law for instituting the action,

the plaint must show the ground upon which exemption from such law is

claimed. It is significant to note that the word used here is not may,

but must pointing to the fact that it is mandatory.

In the instant case, the plaintiff in paragraph 18 of the plaint states that

she became aware of the aforesaid Deeds after the death of her father on

16.05.2006. Whether or not this is true, needs to be tested on evidence.

6

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

If it is true, the cause of action is not prescribed since the case was filed

on 05.06.2007.

The learned District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs action in limine simply

on the basis that the three-year period has lapsed from the dates of

execution of the Deeds. He has not considered when the plaintiff became

aware of the execution of Deeds.

The defence of prescription

Prescription can be divided into two categories: acquisitive prescription

and extinctive prescription. The former operates to acquire a right whilst

the latter operates to extinguish a right.

In either category, a defendant who intends to take up the plea of

prescription must do so in the answer and raise it as an issue. The

defendant cannot take the plea of prescription for the first time on appeal.

The Prescription Ordinance only limits the time within which an action

may be instituted but it does not prohibit an action being instituted

outside the stipulated time limit. If the objection is not raised by the

opposite party in the pleadings, the opposite party is deemed to have

waived it and acquiesced in the action being tried on the merits.

The judge cannot take up the plea of prescription ex mero motu because

a party can waive such objection. Chitty on Contract, Vol I, 33rd edn, para

28-108 states A party is not bound to rely on limitation as a defence if he

does not wish to do so. In general, the court will not raise the point suo

officio even if it appears from the face of the pleading that the relevant

period of limitation has expired. Chitty at para 28-127 states Limitation

is a procedural matter, and not one of substance.

7

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

In Juanis Appuhamy v. Juan Silva (1908) 11 NLR 157, Hutchinson C.J.

and Wood Renton J. state that it is competent for a party to waive a claim

by prescription.

Section 17 of the Prescription Act, No. 68 of 1969 (South Africa) states:

17(1) A court shall not of its own motion take notice of prescription.

(2) A party to litigation who invokes prescription, shall do so in the

relevant document filed of record in the proceedings:

Provided that a court may allow prescription to be raised at any

stage of the proceedings.

It is not obnoxious to law or public policy for parties to agree not to plead

prescription (Hatton National Bank Ltd v. Helenluc Garments Ltd [1999] 2

Sri LR 365). Chitty (ibid) dealing with the English Law states at para 28-

109, An express or implied agreement not to plead the statute, whether

made before or after the limitation period has expired, is valid if supported

by consideration (or made by Deed) and will be given effect to by the

Court. Prof. C.G. Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts, Vol II, para 844,

states: It is not contrary to public policy for parties to enter into an

agreement not to plead limitation. Such an agreement is valid and

enforceable in English Law if supported by consideration, whether it be

made before or after the limitation period has expired. The same

observation holds good for our law, except that such an agreement need

not be supported by consideration.

In Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekere (1948) 50 NLR 253 at 255

Basnayake J. (as His Lordship then was) held:

An attempt was made to argue that the defendants claim was

barred by the Prescription Ordinance (Cap. 55). The plea is not taken

in the plaintiffs replication. There is no issue on the point, nor is

8

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

there any evidence touching it. The plaintiff was represented by

counsel throughout the trial. In these circumstances the plaintiff is

not entitled to raise the question at this stage. It is settled law that

when, as in the case of sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the

Prescription Ordinance, the effect of the statute is merely to limit the

time in which an action may be brought and not to extinguish the

right, the court will not take the statute into account unless it is

specially pleaded by way of defence.

In Gnananathan v. Premawardena [1999] 3 Sri LR 301, the defence taken

in issue Nos. 7-9 was based on section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance.

These issues on prescription were raised after the commencement of the

trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal took the view that the District Judge

should not have accepted those issues as the defendant did not plead

such a defence in the answer. Justice Weerasekera at 309-310 states:

Presumably, the defence taken in the issue is based on section 10 of

the Prescription Ordinance. The acts of nuisance complained of are

thus sought to be shown to have taken place long prior to the 3-year

period. To that the plaintiff-appellants answer is that the application

of the defendant-respondent to the National Housing Department for

the premises to purchase was finally concluded only 2 months

before the institution of the action.

Be that as it may the position in law is quite clear and settled. In the

case of Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekera 50 NLR 253 Basnayake

J. held: Where the effect of the Prescription Ordinance is merely to

limit the time within which an action may be brought, the Court will

not take the statute into account unless it is expressly pleaded by

way of defence.

9

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

It is, therefore, settled law and that for salutary reasons lest all the

basic rules of law particularly that of the rule of audi alteram partem

that if a party to an action intends to raise the plea of prescription it

is obligatory on his part to plead that in his pleadings. I say salutary

because reason, justice and fair play demands that the opposing

party be given an opportunity of making such a plea and that party

or no party should not be taken unawares of a defence taken that

the action is barred by lapse of time.

In this action the answer did not state that the cause of action was

prescribed in law. For the first time this defence was permitted after

the commencement of the evidence. A practice which in my view is

both repugnant to law, reasonableness and fair play and from which

judges should desist. In any event the defendant-respondent has

denied all the acts of nuisance acts pleaded, but also for some

inexplicable reason pleaded non-deterioration. Therefore, a plea of

prescription cannot arise without the act or acts of nuisance being

admitted whereas the defendant-respondent has in his answer

specifically denied them. The plea is, therefore, not only in law, but

also at the stage it was so done, both bad in law, but also

contradictory in itself.

The acceptation of these issues is also repugnant to the law

inasmuch as the date of commencement of prescription is vague in

that the absence of a plea as to whether it was the acts of nuisance

or the date of the notice to quit. It is, therefore, additionally for the

same reason of reasonableness that as is required by section 44 of

the Civil Procedure Code that a plea of the reasons for the non-

operation or application of prescription is mandatory that it is equally

reasonable and fair that the law requires that the defence of

prescription be specifically pleaded in the answer.

10

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

I am, therefore, of the view that issues 7, 8 and 9 should not have

been accepted as issues for adjudication and that the order

accepting them is bad, insupportable and made per incuriam. I,

therefore, reject them.

In the Supreme Court case of Tilakaratne v. Chandrasiri and Another

(SC/APPEAL/172/2013, SC Minutes of 27.01.2017), prescription was

not pleaded as a defence in the answer, no issue regarding prescription

was framed at the trial and there was no suggestion made at the trial that

the plaintiffs action was prescribed. However, at the hearing of the

appeal before the High Court, counsel for the defendants submitted that

the plaintiffs action was one for Goods Sold and Delivered which, by

operation of section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance, was prescribed after

the expiry of one year from the date of the last sale which took place on

30.03.2005 as per the entries in a notebook marked P2. The High Court

accepted this argument and dismissed the plaintiffs action. Prasanna

Jayawardena J. held that the defendant could not have taken up the

defence of prescription for the first time in appeal.

[I]t is settled Law that, a party is prohibited from raising an issue

regarding prescription for the first time in appeal. As Bonser C.J.

described in the early case of TERUNNANSE vs. MENIKE [1 NLR 200

at p.202], a defence of prescription is a shield and not a weapon

of offence. Adopting the phraseology used by the learned Chief

Justice over a century ago, it may be said that, if a Defendant

chooses not to pick up the shield of prescription when he goes into

battle at the trial, the rules of combat are that he forfeits the use of

that shield in appeal.

The High Court Judgment

Let me now turn to the High Court judgment.

11

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

In the impugned judgment, the High Court first discusses the contention

of learned counsel for the plaintiff who argues that the plaintiff became

aware of the existence of the impugned Deeds after the death of her father

and therefore the cause of action is not prescribed.

The High Court does not state whether or not this argument is legally

valid. Instead, it states, Apparently, the plaintiff had not shown any

grounds in the plaint to take the plaintiffs case out of prescription and on

this ground alone the action of the plaintiff has to be dismissed.

This finding is factually incorrect. As I stated previously, the plaintiff in

paragraph 18 of the plaint has stated why the plaintiffs action should be

taken out of prescription.

The High Court admits that the 15th and 16th issues are mixed questions

of fact and law and therefore the District Court erred in law by deciding

to try those issues as preliminary issues.

Having said so, the High Court notes that the plaintiff did not object to

the 1st defendants application to try those issues as preliminary issues.

However, it is pertinent to mention that the plaintiff did not consent to

those issues being tried as preliminary issues.

Even if the plaintiff did, as stated in Mohinudeen v. Lanka Bankuwa

[2001] 1 Sri LR 290 section 147 of the Civil Procedure Code gives a wide

discretion to the trial Judge, so that even if he has decided earlier to try an

issue as a preliminary issue of law, it is open to him to decide such an

issue later, if he is of the view that it cannot be decided without taking

evidence.

The High Court analysed the averments of the plaint and concluded that

the impugned Deeds had not been executed under undue influence and

duress. Although the conclusion of the Court after trial may be the same,

12

SC/APPEAL/48/2017

the High Court could not have made a final determination on that

question without affording the parties the opportunity to adduce

evidence.

Conclusion

The two questions of law quoted above are answered in the following

manner:

12(i) The High Court did not answer this question. The High Court

decided the appeal on a factually wrong basis described in this

judgment. Questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law

cannot be decided as preliminary questions of law.

12(iii) Yes.

The judgments of the District Court and the High Court are set aside.

The District Court shall answer the 15th and 16th issues at the end of the

trial.

The appeal is allowed. The costs of all three Courts will bind the final

outcome of the case.

The substantive matter to be decided in this case is identical to the matter

decided in SC/APPEAL/47/2017 between the same parties. In view of

the judgment delivered by this Court in that case, the plaintiff will

consider whether she should proceed with this matter further in the

District Court.
