"If it is true, the cause of action is not prescribed since the case was filed"
"on 05.06.2007."
"The learned District Judge dismissed the plaintiff’s action in limine simply"
"on  the  basis  that  the  three-year  period  has  lapsed  from  the  dates  of"
"execution of the Deeds. He has not considered when the plaintiff became"
"aware of the execution of Deeds."
"The defence of prescription"
"Prescription can be divided into two categories: acquisitive prescription"
"and extinctive prescription. The former operates to acquire a right whilst"
"the latter operates to extinguish a right."
"In  either  category,  a  defendant  who  intends  to  take  up  the  plea  of"
"prescription  must  do  so  in  the  answer  and  raise  it  as  an  issue.  The"
"defendant cannot take the plea of prescription for the first time on appeal."
"The Prescription Ordinance only limits the time within which an action"
"may  be  instituted  but  it  does  not  prohibit  an  action  being  instituted"
"outside  the  stipulated  time  limit.  If  the  objection  is  not  raised  by  the"
"opposite  party  in  the  pleadings,  the  opposite  party  is  deemed  to  have"
"waived it and acquiesced in the action being tried on the merits."
"The judge cannot take up the plea of prescription ex mero motu because"
"a party can waive such objection. Chitty on Contract, Vol I, 33rd edn, para"
"28-108 states “A party is not bound to rely on limitation as a defence if he"
"does not wish to do  so. In general, the court will not raise the point suo"
"officio  even  if  it  appears  from  the  face  of  the  pleading  that  the  relevant"
"period of limitation has expired.” Chitty at para 28-127 states “Limitation"
"is a procedural matter, and not one of substance”."
