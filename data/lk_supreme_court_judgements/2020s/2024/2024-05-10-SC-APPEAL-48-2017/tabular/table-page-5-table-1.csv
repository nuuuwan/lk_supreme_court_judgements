"However, when a plaintiff seeks cancellation of a notarially executed Deed"
"upon concealed fraud, it was held in Kirthisinghe v. Perera (1922) 23 NLR"
"279  that  the  three-year  period  begins  to  run  not  from  the  date  of"
"execution of the Deed but “from the time of the discovery of the fraud, or"
"from  the  time  the  party  defrauded  might  by  due  diligence  have  come  to"
"know of it.” In Dodwell & Co. Ltd. v. John, both the Supreme Court (1915)"
"18 NLR 133 and the Privy Council (1918) 20 NLR 206 took the same view."
"This  exception  need  not  be  confined  to  fraud.  The  three-year  period"
"should begin to run from the date the plaintiff becomes aware of the very"
"existence of the impugned Deed or from the time the plaintiff might by"
"due diligence have come to know of it."
"For  a  comparable  approach,  fundamental  rights  applications  can  be"
"taken. Although the time limit of one month within which the application"
"shall  be  filed  as  set  out  in  Article  126(2)  is  mandatory,  it  was  held  in"
"Siriwardena v. Brigadier Rodrigo [1986] 1 Sri LR 384 at 387 that “the said"
"period of one month will be computed only from the date on which such"
"petitioner  did  in  fact  become  aware  of  such  infringement  and  was  in  a"
"position to take effective steps to come before this Court.” This position was"
"reiterated  in  several  cases  including  Dayaratne  and  Others  v.  National"
"Savings Bank and Others [2002] 3 Sri LR 116."
"Section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code states “If the cause of action arose"
"beyond the period ordinarily allowed by any law for instituting the action,"
"the plaint must show the ground upon which exemption from such law is"
"claimed.”  It is significant to note that the word used here is not “may”,"
"but “must” pointing to the fact that it is mandatory."
"In the instant case, the plaintiff in paragraph 18 of the plaint states that"
"she became aware of the aforesaid Deeds after the death of her father on"
"16.05.2006. Whether or not this is true, needs to be tested on evidence."
