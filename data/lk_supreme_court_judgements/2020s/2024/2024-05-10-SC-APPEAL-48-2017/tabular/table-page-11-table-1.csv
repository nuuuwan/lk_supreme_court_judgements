"In the impugned judgment, the High Court first discusses the contention"
"of learned counsel for the plaintiff who argues that the plaintiff became"
"aware of the existence of the impugned Deeds after the death of her father"
"and therefore the cause of action is not prescribed."
"The  High  Court  does  not  state  whether  or  not  this  argument  is  legally"
"valid.  Instead,  it  states,  “Apparently,  the  plaintiff  had  not  shown  any"
"grounds in the plaint to take the plaintiff’s case out of prescription” and “on"
"this ground alone the action of the plaintiff has to be dismissed.”"
"This finding is factually incorrect. As I stated previously, the plaintiff in"
"paragraph 18 of the plaint has stated why the plaintiff’s action should be"
"taken out of prescription."
"The High Court admits that the 15th and 16th issues are mixed questions"
"of fact and law and therefore the District Court erred in law by deciding"
"to try those issues as preliminary issues."
"Having said so, the High Court notes that the plaintiff did not object to"
"the 1st defendant’s application to try those issues as preliminary issues."
"However, it is pertinent to mention that the plaintiff did not consent to"
"those issues being tried as preliminary issues."
"Even  if  the  plaintiff  did,  as  stated  in  Mohinudeen  v.  Lanka  Bankuwa"
"[2001] 1 Sri LR 290 “section 147 of the Civil Procedure Code gives a wide"
"discretion to the trial Judge, so that even if he has decided earlier to try an"
"issue  as  a  preliminary  issue  of  law,  it  is  open  to  him  to  decide  such  an"
"issue  later,  if  he  is  of  the  view  that  it  cannot  be  decided  without  taking"
"evidence.”"
"The High Court analysed the averments of the plaint and concluded that"
"the impugned Deeds had not been executed under undue influence and"
"duress. Although the conclusion of the Court after trial may be the same,"
