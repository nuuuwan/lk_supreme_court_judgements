Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

This is an appeal arising from an action instituted in the District Court of Negombo, claiming

damages from the defendants-appellants-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the appellants)

4

on the basis of malicious prosecution of the plaintiff-respondent-respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the respondent).

Facts of the Case

The plaintiff-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) was the

principal of Minuwangoda Nalanda (Boys) Madhiya Maha Vidyalaya at the time material to

the subject matter of the instant appeal.

The 1st and 2nd appellants were the Chairman and the Superintendent of Works respectively of

the Urban Council in Minuwangoda. They initiated the institution of proceedings against the

respondent in the Magistrates Court, alleging that he constructed a parapet wall along the

northern boundary of the school playground, (facing Kurunegala-Minuwangoda Road) without

obtaining the approval of the said Urban Council, and thereby violated section 71(1) of the

Urban Councils Ordinance No. 61 of 1939 as amended.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned Magistrate acquitted the respondent on the basis

that the appellants failed to prove the case. Upon the said acquittal, the respondent instituted

action against the appellants in the District Court of Negombo claiming a sum of Rs.

2,500,000/- as damages for malicious prosecution.

Thereafter, the appellants filed an answer and stated that the respondent had not obtained

approval from the Urban Council prior to constructing the wall as required by the Municipal

Councils Ordinance, and thereby he violated the provisions of the said Ordinance, which is an

offence punishable under the said Ordinance.

Judgment of the District Court

After an inter-parte trial, the learned District judge delivered the judgment in favour of the

respondent and ordered the appellants to pay a sum of Rs. 2 million as damages to the

respondent.

Appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the District Court, the appellants preferred an appeal

to the High Court of Civil Appeals of the Western Province holden in Gampaha (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court).

After the hearing of the said appeal, the High Court by its judgement dated 9th of December,

2014, partially allowed the appeal and varied the damages awarded by the District Court by

reducing the amount from Rs.1,000,000/- to Rs. 500,000/- payable jointly and severally by the

appellants to the respondent.

Appeal to the Supreme Court

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court, the appellants sought special leave to

appeal from this court and the Supreme Court granted special leave to appeal on the following

questions of law,

(e) Their Lordships of the Civil Appeals High Court erred in law in not taking

cognizance of the fact that the acts of the Petitioners were done in bona fides

upon a decision and directive of the Minuwangoda Urban Council

(f) Their Lordships in the Civil Appeals High Court have erred in law in holding

that a letter issued by the Road Development Authority amounts to a valid

permit for the construction of the boundary wall.

Application of section 220 of the Urban Councils Ordinance

The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the District Court and the High Court

failed to hold that the statutory protection afforded to any Urban Council, or any member, or

any officer for acts done bona fide in terms of section 220 of the Urban Councils Ordinance

requires one months notice to be given prior to the institution of legal action.

The learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that the respondent did not comply

with section 220(1). Therefore, the District Court and High Court should have dismissed the

action for non-compliance of section 220(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

However, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that section 220(1) deals with only

bona fide acts of the Urban Council or its officers. Further, the respondent alleged and later

established mala fides on the part of the appellants, and submitted that it is not necessary to

give notice under section 220(1) of the said Ordinance.

Section 220(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance reads as follows:

No action shall be instituted against any Urban Council or any member or

any officer of the Council or any person acting under the direction of the

10

Council for anything done or intended to be done under the powers conferred

by this Ordinance, or any by-law made thereunder, until the expiration of one

month next after notice in writing shall have been given to the Council or to

the defendant, stating with reasonable certainty the cause of such action and

the name and place of abode of the plaintiff and of his attorney-at-law or agent,

if any, in such action.

[emphasis added]

The phrase anything done or intended to be done under the powers conferred by this

Ordinance or any by-law made thereunder shows that section 220(1) of the said Ordinance

provides protection only to the acts carried out or intended to be carried out under the said

Ordinance. However, any acts carried out or intended to be carried out outside the provisions

of the said Ordinance or with malice do not come within the protection afforded in section

220(1) of the said Ordinance.

Section 461 in the Civil Procedure Code is a similar provision to section 220(1) of the said

Ordinance. It states,

No action shall be instituted against the Attorney-General as representing

the State, or against a Minister, Deputy Minister or public officer in respect

of an act purporting to be done by him in his official capacity, until the

expiration of one month next after notice in writing has been delivered to

such Attorney-General, Minister, Deputy Minister, or officer (as the case

may be), or left at his office, stating the cause of action and the name and

place of abode of the person intending to institute the action and the relief

which he claims; and the plaint in such action must contain a statement that

such notice has been delivered or left.

[emphasis added]

In Appusingo Appu vs. Don Aron 9 NLR 138 at page 140, the court considered the

applicability of the notice requirement stipulated in section 461 of the Civil Procedure Code

11

as well as other privileges accorded in the said Code to the public servants acting in official

capacity and held;

It would be intolerable if these privileges could be claimed by a public

officer who is acting wrongfully and for the gratification of private malice,

whose official authority appears only in his badge as police vidane or in his

possession of those Government diaries.

In the circumstances, having considered the facts and circumstances of the instant appeal, I am

of the opinion that section 220(1) of the said Ordinance has no application to the appellants as

the respondent proved the appellants acted outside the provisions of the said Ordinance and

with malice in prosecuting him in the said Magistrates Court. This aspect is considered in

detail later in this judgment.

Did the appellants act bona fide in instituting the Magistrates Court Case against the

respondent and prosecuting him?

The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that in or around June, 1995, the respondent

commenced the construction of an unauthorised boundary wall in front of the school. Hence,

the 2nd appellant had informed the respondent to stop the construction as it was in violation of

the provisions of the Urban Council Ordinance as no valid permit had been issued by the Urban

Council for the said construction.

However, as the said construction was not stopped, the Municipal Council, at a special council

meeting held on the 9th of June, 1995, resolved to institute legal action under section 72(2) for

violating section 72(1) of the aforementioned Ordinance. Further, the counsel for the appellants

submitted that in implementing the Council Resolution, the 1st appellant had issued a letter

dated 11th June, 1995 authorising the 2nd appellant to institute legal action against the

respondent. Accordingly, on the 13th of June 1995, proceedings were instituted in terms of

section 136(1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code by the 2nd appellant against the respondent

for committing an offence punishable under section 72(2) of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

12

The minutes of the said special council meeting held on the 9th of June, 1995 stated;

,

,

,

,

.

Furthermore, at the said meeting, the 1st appellant was requested to find out who is responsible

for investigating issue.

The above minute shows that the appellants were cautioned by the members of the Municipal

Council with regard to taking legal action in respect of the construction of the wall. However,

the appellants have failed and/or neglected to ascertain the person who was responsible for the

construction of the wall prior to the institution of the proceedings in the Magistrates Court.

The evidence led at the trial before the Magistrates Court shows that the respondent had

produced the letter issued by the Road Development Authority, stating that construction of the

boundary wall was permitted subject to demolition without compensation. Further, the Road

Development Authority had informed it by letter dated 25th July, 1995 to the Director of

Education, with a copy to the 1st appellant of the Urban Council of Minuwangoda. Nonetheless,

the 2nd appellant had continued with the prosecution against the respondent.

13

Section 72(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance states as follows;

"(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to commence any building, boundary

wall, gateway of fence along any thoroughfare within any town, or to erect any

temporary fence or enclosure on any such thoroughfare for the purpose of

commencing or repairing any such building, boundary, wall or gateway without

giving one calendar months previous notice in writing to the Urban Council of

that town."

(2) Any person neglecting to give the notice prescribed by subsection (1) or to

remove any building, boundary wall, gateway or fence erected without such

notice when he is required in writing to do so by the Urban Council under this

subsection, shall be guilty of an offence, punishable with a fine not exceeding

five hundred rupees, and with a further fine not exceeding two hundred rupees

for each day he suffers or allows such building, boundary wall, gateway or fence

to remain after he is required to remove it as aforesaid.

[emphasis added]

However, neither the Urban Council nor the appellants had given notice to the respondent in

writing to demolish the wall in terms of section 72(2) of the said Ordinance prior to the

institution of the said proceedings in the Magistrates Court. Moreover, if the said Municipal

Council or the appellants complied with the said section 72(2) and given notice to the

respondent, he could have informed the fact that he was not responsible for the construction of

the wall under consideration.

Further, it was revealed that during the year 1995, a Japanese Company known as Hashima

Corporation had started to construct the parapet wall along the Northern Boundary of the said

school, at the behest of the Ministry of Education and other relevant authorities. Moreover,

when the 2nd appellant came to the school, the respondent had informed the 2nd appellant that

he was only the principal of the school but had no proprietary rights to the school property as

it comes under the Department of Education.

Furthermore, on the first day in the Magistrates Court, it was brought to the notice of the

prosecution that the Urban Council was prosecuting the wrong person. However, the appellants

had failed to look into it and proceeded with the trial.

14

Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in law in not taking cognizance of the fact that the

acts of the Appellants were done bona fide upon a decision and directive of the

Minuwangoda Urban Council?

The issue that needs to be considered in the instant appeal is whether the appellants committed

the delict of malicious prosecution of the respondent.

The Law of Delict by R. G. McKerron at page 259, states;

That every person has a right to set the law in motion, but a person who

institutes legal proceedings against another maliciously, without

reasonable and proper cause abuses that right and commits an actionable

wrong.

The chief classes of proceedings to which the rule applies are: 1.

malicious criminal prosecution: 2. malicious imprisonment or arrest 3.

malicious execution against property 4. Malicious insolvency and

liquidation proceedings and 5. malicious civil actions.

Further, it states;

It is an actionable wrong to institute, or cause to be instituted criminal

proceedings against any person maliciously and without reasonable cause.

To entitle the accused to succeed in a subsequent civil action for damages,

however, he must in principle show either that the proceedings caused him

patrimonial loss or that the offence with which he was charged was

calculated to injure his reputation. But this requirement is of little practical

importance; because in nearly every case he would have incurred legal

costs in defending himself against the charge brought against him, and it

has been held that he can recover any such costs reasonably incurred as

patrimonial loss.

Hence, the following facts should be proved to succeed in a malicious prosecution case;

(i) The prosecution should have failed.

15

(ii) The prosecution ended up in an acquittal on merits,

(iii) The absence of reasonable and probable cause, and

(iv) Malice

A similar view was held in the case of Moss v Wilson 8 NLR 368 at page 369, where it was

held,

There is no doubt as to what the essential elements of the action for

malicious prosecution are. The plaintiff must prove that a charge was made

to a judicial officer, that the charge was false-its falsity being demonstrated,

where prosecution has followed, by the plaintiffs acquittal-that the charge

was made without reasonable cause, and that the defendant himself did not

honestly believe it to be true.

Further, the case of Karunaratne v Karunaratne 63 NLR 365, held;

To succeed in an action of this nature, the Plaintiff must establish that the

charge was false and false to the knowledge of the person giving the

information that it was made with a view to prosecution, that it was made

animo injuriandi and not with a view to vindicate public justice and that

it was made without probable cause

Upon a careful consideration of the aforementioned evidence, it is apparent that the appellants

acted not only contrary to the provisions of the Urban Councils Ordinance in prosecuting the

respondent, but also acted without a reasonable and probable cause to believe that the

respondent was responsible for the construction of the wall. Particularly, notwithstanding the

fact that it was brought to their notice that the respondent had no control over the construction

of the wall, the appellants continued with the prosecution in the Magistrates Court. In the

circumstances, the evidence led at the trial shows that the appellants acted with malice by

instituting criminal proceedings against the respondent and prosecuting him.

16

Conclusion

In view of the above findings, I am of the opinion that the District Court and the High Court

did not err in holding that the appellant acted with mala fide in prosecution the respondent. In

the circumstances, I answer the following question of law as follows;

Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in law in not taking cognizance of the fact that the

acts of the Appellants were done bona fide upon a decision and directive of the Minuwangoda

Urban Council?

No

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

No costs.
