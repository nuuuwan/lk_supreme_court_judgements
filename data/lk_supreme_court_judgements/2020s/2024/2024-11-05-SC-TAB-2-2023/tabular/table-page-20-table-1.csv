"In the course of the argument, the following extract from the Judgment of Weerasuriya J., in"
"the  case  of  Samy and others v Attorney-General (Bindunuwewa murder case),7  was"
"highlighted:"
"“Having regard to the departmental orders referred to above if the Officer-in-"
"Charge has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability, he"
"cannot be faulted for the action he has taken even if it may appear that another"
"course of action would have proved more effective in the circumstances.”"
"H
owever, I observe that Weerasuriya J in that case, has stated that paragraph in his Judgment"
"when he was dealing with the case against  the 4th  Accused  in that  case who  was a Police"
"Officer.  The  charges  against  the  said  4th  Accused  (Police  Officer)  were  based  on  illegal"
"omissions which consisted of the general allegation of intentional failure to comply with the"
"duty imposed by law and certain specific illegal omissions in his capacity as a Police Officer."
"The charges against the 4th Accused in that case,  were based under Section 146 of the Penal"
"Code. The Court in that case had held that there was no evidence to establish that the 4th"
"Accused being a Police Officer, had intentionally joined the unlawful assembly with the object"
"of causing hurt to the detainees. Furthermore, the High Court-at-Bar in that case had called"
"for the defence from the said 4th Accused and the 4th Accused in that case had provided an"
"explanation and the reasons for not shooting at the attackers directly. His explanation was his"
"inability to distinguish between the detainees and the villagers in the commotion. It was in"
"the face of the said defence placed by the 4th Accused that Weerasuriya J in that case had"
"held that the mere fact that there was a duty to act in the given circumstances and death had"
"resulted due to the said failure to act, will not be sufficient to establish the offence.8 One has"
"to  be  mindful  that  in  the  instant  case,  the  Accused-Respondent  has  not  yet  provided  an"
"explanation or reasons as the High Court-at-Bar decided not to call for the defence from him."
"Thus, the facts and circumstances of Bindunuwewa murder case is also clearly distinguishable"
"from the facts and circumstances of the instant case. Furthermore, the phrase ‘if the Officer-"
"i
n-Charge has exercised his discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability,’ found in the"
"dictum  quoted  above  from  the  Judgment  of  Weerasuriya  J  in Bindunuwewa murder case,9"
"shows clearly that it is incumbent upon the accused to satisfy Court that he has exercised his"
"discretion bona fide and to the best of his ability which in that case, the 4th Accused had done."
