"offender.  This  was  not  the  charge  presented  in  the  indictment.  This  was  not  the  case"
"presented by the Prosecution. Thus, the necessary inference from the above position is the"
"fact that the two learned High Court Judges had totally failed to consider whether the evidence"
"adduced  by  the  Prosecution  has  established  the  case  presented  by  the  Attorney  General"
"against the Accused-Respondent. This misdirection on the part of the two learned High Court"
"Judges in the majority  Judgment  is so serious and so grave. Thus, the learned High Court"
"Judges in the majority  Judgment  could not have lawfully taken the view that the evidence"
"adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of the offence against the"
"Accused-Respondent in the indictment in terms of limbs (B) or (C) in Section 200 (1). This is"
"simply because they had failed to understand  the charges presented in the indictment and"
"the  case  presented  by  the  Prosecution  against  the  Accused-Respondent.  Thus,  the  charge"
"they had in mind when they proceeded to consider evidence in the process of ascertaining"
"whether the evidence adduced by the Prosecution has failed to establish the commission of"
"the  offence  against  the  Accused  in  the  indictment,  was  not  the  charge  mentioned  in  the"
"indictment.  Hence  the  final  conclusion  reached  in  the  majority  Judgment  based  on  such"
"misconception becomes untenable for that reason alone. Therefore, the majority Judgment"
"by the two learned High Court Judges cannot be permitted to stand on that account."
