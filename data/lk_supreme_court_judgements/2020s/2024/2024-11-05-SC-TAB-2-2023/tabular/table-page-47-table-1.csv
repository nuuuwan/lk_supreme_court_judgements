"In  my  view,  the  question  of  intention  was  not  seriously  and  adequately  addressed  at  the"
"argument  before  us;  the  primary  focus  was  on  the  adequacy  and  inadequacy  of the  steps"
"taken by the accused to prevent the suicide attacks. The question of intention is not a pure"
"question of law to be raised for the first time on appeal. It is a mixed question of fact and law."
"The question of intention was not explicitly raised as a distinct issue before the Trial at Bar."
"There was no opportunity for the Attorney General to make submissions before the Trial at"
"Bar regarding the question of intention or any other matter. Therefore, the Trial at Bar did"
"not have the advantage of hearing both parties before it decided that there was no intentional"
"aid on the part of the accused by illegal omission that enabled the suicide bombers to launch"
"the attacks."
