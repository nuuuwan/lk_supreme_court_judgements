"Moreover, I also must emphasize here that the intention is a state of mind which under normal"
"circumstances, is inferred from other proven facts and circumstances. Indeed, this was the"
"same thinking in the case of The King v Marshall, where Dias J re-iterated that “the intention"
"o
f
 
an abettor must be presumed from the nature and effect of the facility given by him to the"
"doer of the act” as laid down in Rex v. Kadirgaman.10"
"I
 must also mention here that under the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, the"
"offence  of  Murder  is  constituted,  if  the  person  committing  the  act  knows  that  it  is  so"
"imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is"
"likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing"
"death  or  such  injury  as aforesaid.  In  light  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  the"
"phrase “without any excuse” mentioned in the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code"
"assumes a greater importance. Who has to provide the excuse in such circumstances? If there"
"is no apparent excuse, all that the Prosecution can prove is just that. It would then be the"
"accused who must take steps to place the excuse if he has one. If there is none, according to"
"the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code, any act falling under the description therein,"
"may constitute the offence of Murder."
"T
hus, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I am of the view"
"that the High Court-at-bar, should have considered about the proof of the intention; degree"
"of such intention; whether knowledge on the part of the Accused-Respondent would amount"
"to the required intention, at the end of the case, i.e., after calling for the defence from the"
"Accused-Respondent."
"A
s stated previously, the pieces of information set out under Item Nos. I, II, IV, V, which are"
"the  pieces  of  information  which  the  Accused-Respondent  was  allegedly  in  receipt,  are"
"respectively the information set out in the documents produced, respectively marked පැ 8,"
"පැ 12,  පැ 15, and පැ 16. It is based on these information that the Accused-Respondent is"
"alleged  to  have  committed  all  the  offences  set  out  in  the  several  counts  in  the  indictment"
"served  on  him.  The  Defence  has  admitted  that  they  do  not  dispute  the  accuracy  of  the"
"contents  of  the  said  pieces  of  information  as  per  the  admissions  recorded  in  the  court"
"proceedings dated 15-12-2021, in the Trail-at-Bar. The said admission is reproduced below."
