"","E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his treatise, The Law of Evidence, Vol II, Book I, page 267 states"
"that the term “no evidence” has often been referred to as not a scintilla of evidence.",""
"I","t may be on the rarest occasions that an indictment would be filed by the Attorney General"
"","in  the  High  Court  without  a  scintilla  of  evidence.  The  Attorney  General  performs  a  quasi-"
"","judicial  function  and  is  not  tasked  with  securing  convictions  at  any  cost,  but  rather  with"
"","upholding the rule of law independently and impartially, ensuring the proper administration of"
"","justice.  However,  there  may  be  instances  where  the  evidence  presented  by  the  Attorney"

"T","he Attorney General v. Ratwatte (1967) 72 CLW 92 is a case where the judge has wholly"

"","But in my view no reasonable court can accept the oral testimony of Papuraj that this"
