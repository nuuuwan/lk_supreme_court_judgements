"","automatically enter a conviction. The Court has a duty thereafter to meticulously reassess and"
"","reconsider the entirety of the evidence as a separate exercise in determining the guilt of the"

"has no bearing on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution throughout the trial.",""
"I","n Sinha Ranatunga v. The State (supra) at page 189, Yapa J. in the Court of Appeal stated"
"","that  in  an  application  for  no  case  to  answer  under  section  200(1),  “A prima facie case"
"necessarily means a case beyond reasonable doubt – at first sight i.e. on the evidence",""
"available on record as at the close of the prosecution case.” With respect, I find myself unable",""
"","to  accept  this  definition.  A  Prima facie  case  and  proof  beyond  reasonable  doubt  are  two"
"","different and irreconcilable concepts. Prima facie is a Latin term which means “at first sight”."
"Prima facie evidence is neither conclusive nor irrefutable. A prima facie case may not stand or",""
"fall by itself.",""
"A","t the close of the prosecution case, it is not prudent to consider whether the prosecution has"
"","proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt, as this could undermine a fundamental principle"
"","of the criminal justice system that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty."
"","This presumption extends not only until the conclusion of the prosecution case but persists"
"","until the entire trial is completed, ensuring that both parties are given the opportunity to be"
"","heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice. However, if no prima facie case is"
"","established against the accused, he is entitled to an early acquittal. If proof beyond reasonable"
"","doubt were to be accepted as the standard at the close of the prosecution case, then, should"
"","the accused choose to remain silent after the defence is called, it would necessarily lead to an"
"automatic conviction.",""
"L","ord Parker C.J. (with the concurrence of Ashworth and Fenton Atkinson JJ.) elucidated the"
"","applicable  test  at  the  close  of  the  prosecution  case  in  his  “Practice  Directions”  reported  in"
"[1962] 1 All ER 448 as follows:",""
"","Those of us who sit in the Divisional Court have the distinct impression that justices"
"","today are being persuaded all too often to uphold a submission of no case. In the"
"","result, this court has had on many occasions to send the case back to the justices for"
"","the hearing to be continued with inevitable delay and increased expenditure. Without"
"","a
ttempting to lay down any principle of law, we think that as a matter of practice"
"","j
ustices should be guided by the following considerations."
