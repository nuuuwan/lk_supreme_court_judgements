"verdict of acquittal; if however the Judge considers that there are grounds for"
"proceeding with the trial he shall call upon the accused for his defence."
"When the case for the prosecution is closed, section 200(1) permits the Judge to acquit the"
"accused on two main grounds:"
"(a) If he wholly disbelieves the evidence led by the prosecution or"
"(b) even  if  he  wholly  believes  such  evidence,  if  such  evidence  fails  to  establish  the"
