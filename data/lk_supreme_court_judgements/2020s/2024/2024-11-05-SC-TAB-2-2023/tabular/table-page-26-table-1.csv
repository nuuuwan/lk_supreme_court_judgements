"the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and that there is no"
"purpose of “flogging a dead horse”. We ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the"
"development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical"
"end, to insist on technicality to the point of almost sanctifying it.”"
"There is no reason to disagree with this dictum; if it is apparent to Court as well as to"
"counsel that to continue is to waste time and to flog a dead horse, the case should of"
"course be stopped. Again, if prosecuting counsel concedes or is constrained to admit"
"that all the evidence on which the prosecution case is based has been led and what"
"remains to be led is formal evidence or other supporting evidence which will not take"
"the case any further, then the virtual end of the prosecution case has been reached"
"and a court may fairly act under Section 212(2). But if there is such other evidence"
"still to be led on behalf of the prosecution which the Judge has to reckon and give"
"weight to in considering whether there is a case to go to the Jury, it appears to us that"
"a
 
Judge will be acting contrary to S.212(2) in making a direction before he hears that"
"evidence."
