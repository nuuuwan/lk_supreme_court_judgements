"â€œCourt may acquit without calling for defence, or call for defence."
"(
1) When the case for the prosecution is closed, if the judge wholly discredits the"
"evidence on the part of the prosecution or is of opinion that such evidence fails to"
"establish the commission of the offence charged against the accused in the indictment"
"or of any other offence of which he might be convicted on such indictment, he shall"
"record a verdict of acquittal; if however the judge considers that there are grounds for"
"proceeding with the trial he shall call upon the accused for his defence."
