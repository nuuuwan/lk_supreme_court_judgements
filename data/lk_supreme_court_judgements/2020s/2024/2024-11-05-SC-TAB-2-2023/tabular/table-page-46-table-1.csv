"The major part of the judgment of the Trial at Bar is set apart to say that the accused has"
"taken adequate steps to prevent suicide attacks whereas the prosecution version is that the"
"steps alleged to have been taken by the accused are grossly inadequate. That is not a question"
"of law but a question of fact which should be decided at the end of the trial, not at the end"
"of the prosecution case. While my view is provisional and not binding, I concur with Justice"
"Surasena that the accused did not take adequate steps that he could or ought to have taken"
"to prevent the suicide attacks. I do not wish to elaborate on this aspect further, given the final"
"conclusion reached by Justice Surasena, with which I entirely agree."
