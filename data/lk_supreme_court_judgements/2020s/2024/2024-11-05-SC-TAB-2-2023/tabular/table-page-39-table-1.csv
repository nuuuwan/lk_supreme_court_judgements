"When, at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is"
"“no case to answer”, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it"
"stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands"
"he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless there is some"
"special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a “case to answer” has"
"no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning"
"to end. After the prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support proof of the"

"question to be decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the whole of the"

"The Court of Appeal judgment in Attorney General v. Baranage (supra) is largely founded on"
"the seminal judgment of the Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom in R. v. Galbraith [1981]"
"1  WLR  1039  decided  on  19.05.1981.  It  was  a  Jury  trial.  At  the  close  of  the  prosecution"
