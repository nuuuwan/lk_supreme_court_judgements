"a
 
Judge will be acting contrary to S.212(2) in making a direction before he hears that"
"evidence."
"Nevertheless, some raise doubt as to whether this principle of terminating trials at their virtual"
"end applies only to jury trials, primarily because the Pauline de Croos  case involved a jury"
"trial. In my view, this is a not correct."
"When the Pauline de Croos case was decided in 1968, High Courts were non-existent, and"
"according to section 29 of the Courts Ordinance, the criminal sessions of the Supreme Court"
"were conducted before a judge and a jury. Following the establishment of High Courts with"
"the enactment of the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, section 193 mandated"
"that all trials before the High Court be tried by a jury before a judge. After the enactment of"
"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, section 161 stipulated that all serious"
"offences  were  to  be  tried  on  indictment  in  the  High  Court  by  a  jury.  This  provision  was"
"amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, No. 11 of 1988, which provides"
"that  all  prosecutions  on  indictment  in  the  High  Court  shall  be  tried  by  a  judge  unless  the"
"accused elects to be tried by a jury. In practical terms, following this amendment in 1988, all"
"trials  in  the  High  Court  are  conducted  before  a  judge  alone,  making  jury  trials  virtually"
"obsolete."
"The practice of stopping trials at their virtual, though not technical, end is equally applicable"
"to jury trials as well as non-jury trials. Over two decades ago, in Attorney General v. Baranage"
