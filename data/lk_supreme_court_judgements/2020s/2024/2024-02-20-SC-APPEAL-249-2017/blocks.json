Having regard to the inequitable consequences that flow from treating the words 'shall by reason of such conviction be forfeited to the State' as mandatory. I am inclined to hold, as the House of Lords did in A. G. v. Parsons (supra) (14) that \"forfeited\" meant \"liable to be forfeited. \" and thus avoid the injustice that would flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic on the conviction of the accused. Having regard to the above rules of construction, I am unable to hold that the amended subsection 40 excludes by necessary implication the rule of 'audi alteram partem'. On this construction the petitioner, as owner of lorry bearing No. 26 Sri 2518 is entitled to be heard on the question of forfeiture and if he satisfies the court that the accused committed the offence without his knowledge or participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture.\u201d",
