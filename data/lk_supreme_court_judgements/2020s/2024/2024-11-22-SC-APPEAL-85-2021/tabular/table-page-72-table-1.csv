"instance  where  a 
lacuna  was  discovered 
in 
the  procedural  aspect 
in"
"granting of Annual Practising Licences, but of vires of the authority, which"
"granted the impugned licences."
"The  issue  presented  by  Hevavitharana  v  Themis  de  Silva  (supra)"
"before the then Supreme Court was whether a trial Court could exclude a"
"separate land, wrongly included by a plaintiff, as being part of the  corpus"
"of a partition case. In delivering the judgment,  Tambiah J, stated (at p. 71)"
"that “ … it is not the intention of the legislature in passing the Partition Act that"
"the Court should partition any lands other than those that came within the ambit"
"of section 2 of the Act” and proceeded to reject the contention that Section 26"
"of  the  Partition  Act  makes  no  provision  for  excluding  from  a  partition"
"action, any part of the land to which the action relates. The Court held that"
"the said Section “… does not exhaust all the orders which a Court could make, in"
"our  view  the  Court  has  the 
inherent  power,  under  section  839  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure  Code,  to  make  an  order  excluding  a 
lot  which  has  been  wrongly"
"included in the corpus”. It is in this context, his Lordship found it apposite to"
"reproduce  the  pronouncement  made  by  Mahmood,  J.,  in  Narsingh  Das  v."
"Mangal  Dubey  (1883)  5  Allahabad  163,  (at  p.  172)  to  the  effect  that  the"
"“[C]ourts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as"
"prohibited  unless  it  is  expressly  provided  for  by  the  Code,  but  on  the  converse"
"principle that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to"
"be  prohibited  by  the  law.  As  a  matter  of  general  principle  prohibitions  cannot  be"
"presumed.”"
"It  is  clear  from  the  text,  that  this  pronouncement  was  made  by"
"Mahmood,  J.,  in  relation  to  an  interpretation  that  should  be  given  to  a"
"provision contained in the Civil Procedure Code of India. The judgment of"
"72"
