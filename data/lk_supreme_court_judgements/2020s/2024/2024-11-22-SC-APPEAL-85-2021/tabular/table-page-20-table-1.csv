"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"Appointment  issued  to surveyors  of  the  Department  and  also  conform  to"
"the policy of the Government."
"In relation to the issue under discussion, it must be highlighted that"
"the clear advice given by the Attorney General was there must be a policy"
"decision taken in this regard by the Government, meaning a decision taken"
"by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  and  not  the  Minister  in  charge  of  land  and"
"land  development.  This  condition  also  presupposes  that  there  was  no"
"policy  decision  made  by  the  Government  in  granting  permission  to  the"
"surveyors  of  the  Survey  Department  to  engage  in  ‘private  practice’.  It  is"
"rather  strange  that  none  of  the  parties  thought  it  fit  to  produce  a  single"
"letter of appointment issued to a surveyor, who is employed in the Survey"
"Department,  in  their  pleadings,  and  facilitating  the  Courts  to  have  an"
"understanding of the exact terms and conditions that are stipulated therein"
"in  relation  to  their  scope  of  employment.  If  the  contents  of  the  Letters  of"
"Appointment  support  the  Respondent’s  position,  then  it  is  obvious  that"
"they would have relied on  them by bringing them to the notice of Court."
"It must also be noted in this context that the Secretary, in informing"
"his Minister of the basis on which the Government Medical Officers were"
"permitted  to  engage  in  private  practice  by  the  Secretary  to  Ministry  of"
"Health,  upon  the  concurrence  of  the  relevant  Minister,  made  a  rather"
"misleading  statement  to  his  Minister  which  even  could  be  considered  as"
"contrary  to  the  express  provisions  that  contained  in  the  Establishments"
"Code that govern the issue of private practice of health professionals. This"
"is because, the provisions contained in Section 1:4 were made inapplicable"
"to them by that Code."
