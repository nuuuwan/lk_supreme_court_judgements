"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"Thus, it is clear that the scheme put in place by the Act did recognise the"
"two groups as distinct from each other,  despite the  apparent similarity of"
"the work they do, namely,  land surveying."
"In relation to the contention that had been placed before the Court of"
"Appeal  over  the  ‘two’  groups  of  registered  surveyors,  the  Petitioners,  in"
"addition  to  Section  44(1),  also  relied  on  its  proviso.  The  Petitioners  claim"
"that it is yet another instance where the Legislature retained the distinction"
"it  made  between  these 
‘two’  groups,  as 
in  terms  of  that  Section,  the"
"registered  surveyors  who  engaged  in  land  surveying  on  behalf  of  the"
"Government  are  exempted 
from  otherwise  a  mandatory  requirement,"
"imposed on other registered surveyors by the Act, namely the necessity to"
"obtain an Annual Practising Licence, if they are to practice land surveying."
"The Respondents, on the other hand, contend that Section 44 clearly"
"contemplates  a  situation  in  which  a  registered  surveyor  in  the  service  of"
"Government, 
if 
issued  with  an  Annual  Practising  Licence, 
too  could"
"engage in the practice of land surveying for fee or reward, as the Circular"
"issued  by  the  Surveyor  General,  merely  outlines    the  conditions  that  are"
"attached to the granting of such permission."
"Learned  DSG,  in  his  submissions  made  before  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"as  well  as  this  Court,    contended  that  Article  14(1)(g)  of  the  Constitution"
"guarantees 
every 
citizen  of 
the 
freedom 
to 
engage 
in 
any 
lawful"
"occupation  and  this  right  could  be  restricted  only  on  the  grounds  laid"
"down 
in  Article  17,  and 
that  too  by 
in  terms  of  “law”,  meaning  an"
"enactment of Parliament. In the absence of any statutory prohibition for a"
"registered  surveyor,  who  engaged 
in 
land  surveying  on  behalf  of  the"
"Government,  to  engage  in  ‘private  practice’,  after  obtaining  an  Annual"
"45"
