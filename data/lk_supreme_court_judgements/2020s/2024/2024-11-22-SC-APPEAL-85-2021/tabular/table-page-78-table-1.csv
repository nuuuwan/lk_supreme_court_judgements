"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"In an instance where the same principle, which the Court of Appeal"
"acted  on,  in  determining  the  three  applications  before  it,  was  applied  by"
"Sir Robert Megarry VC, ( in Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioners"
"[1979] Ch 344), by permitting telephone tapping by the police, on the basis"
"that “ … if such tapping can be carried out without committing any breach of the"
"law, it requires no authorisation by statute or common law; it can lawfully be done"
"simply because there is nothing to  make  it unlawful”  as  England “ … is not a"
"country where everything is expressly permitted; it is a country where everything"
"is permitted  except what is expressly forbidden”.  That decision was interfered"
"with by European Court of Human Rights in Malone v UK 7 EHRR 14, by"
"stating  that  “…  the  interference  resulting  from  the  existence  of  the  practice  in"
"question  was  not  ‘in accordance  with  the  law’  ”,  for  the  purpose  of  Article  8."
"Apparently, the Interception of communications Act 1985 was introduced"
"in England to provide the statutory framework for telephone tapping."
