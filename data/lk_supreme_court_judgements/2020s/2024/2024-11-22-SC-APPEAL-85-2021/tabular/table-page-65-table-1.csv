"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"professing to practise land surveying”.  Section 41(4) confers a title on such a"
"registered surveyor as a “registered licensed surveyor”."
"None  of  the  Sections  referred  to in  the  preceding  paragraphs  made"
"any  specific  reference  to  a  registered  surveyor,  who  is  engaged  in  land"
"surveying on behalf of the Government and  under the supervision of the"
"Surveyor  General,  could  also  apply  for  an  Annual  Practising  Licence  to"
"practise land surveying for a fee or reward and the Council could grant a"
"licence  to  such  an  applicant.  This  is  the  premise  on  which  the  Petitioners"
"have founded their challenge on validity of the decision of the Council. On"
"the other hand, the Respondents, who resists the Petitioner’s claim, rely on"
"the fact that there is no express prohibition either for the Council to desist"
"itself from granting such licences as the Sections merely referred to “every"
"registered surveyor” without any qualification."
"Clearly, Section 41(1) could be taken as the gateway through which"
"each  of  the  registered  surveyors  must  pass  through,  in  order  to  earn  the"
"title  “registered  licensed  surveyor”  from  the  Council.    The  placement  of  the"
"proviso 
in  Section  41(1), 
instead  under  any  other  Section  of  the  Act,"
"supports the view that  Section 44(1) statutorily demarcates the boundaries"
"within which each of the two groups should engage in their chosen field of"
"expertise.  If  a  registered  surveyor,  who  wish  only  to  engage 
in 
land"
"surveying on behalf of the Government, he need not trouble himself with"
"the  process  set  out  in  Sections  41(1)  and  (2).  Hence  the  words  “[E]very"
"registered 
surveyor” 
that 
contains 
in  Section 
41(1) 
is  pivotal 
to 
the"
"determination of the instant appeals."
"In  view  of  these  statutory  provisions,  the  question  that  arise  for"
"determination  is  whether  the  words  ‘every  registered  surveyor’  in  Section"
"65"
