"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"only a registered surveyor, who holds an Annual Practising Licence, may"
"engage in the “practice” of land surveying for a fee or reward. Section 41 of"
"the Act empowers the Council to grant Annual Practising Licences to those"
"of who seeks to ‘practice’ land surveying, among  the registered surveyors."
"Thus,  it  is  with  a  licence  only  a  registered  surveyor  could  engage  in  the"
"‘practice of land surveying’  and not on a Circular issued by his head of the"
"Department."
