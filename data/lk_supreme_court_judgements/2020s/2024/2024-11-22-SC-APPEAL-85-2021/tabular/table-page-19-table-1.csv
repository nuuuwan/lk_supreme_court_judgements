"that it indicates in no uncertain terms that it was the Minister who decided"
"to  grant  permission  for  the  members  of  that  Union  to  engage  in  ‘private"
"practice’."
"After  these  events  that  had  taken  place  in  the  Month  of  June  2011,"
"the  Secretary 
to 
the  Ministry,  by  his 
letter  dated  13.11.2011,  sought"
"approval  of  his  Minister 
for  his  approval 
to 
the  surveyors,  who  are"
"employed in the Survey Department, to engage in private practice. In that"
"letter,  the  Secretary  refers  to  a  prior  discussion  they  had  with  the  Union"
"and  reminds  his  Minister  of  the  fact  that  he  (the  Minister)  has  already"
"approved  the  said  request  “  in  principle”.  The  Secretary  also  refers  to  an"
"opinion  expressed  by  the  Attorney  General,  and  supports  the  decision"
"already taken by the Minister, by adding that he personally verified from"
"the  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of  Health  as  to  the  basis  on  which  the"
"Government  Medical  Officers  were  granted  permission 
to  engage 
in"
"private practice and found out that it has been granted with the approval"
"of  the  Minister  of  Health.  The  Minister  makes  an  endorsement,  on  his"
"Secretary’s request for permission, as “approved”."
"The said letter of the Secretary also refers to several areas of concern"
"expressed  by  the  Attorney  General 
in  his  opinion  on  the  question  of"
"permitting  ‘private  practice’  to  surveyors  in  the  Survey  Department.  The"
"opinion of the Attorney General covered three aspects. First,  it states that"
"there is no express prohibition imposed by the Act for the surveyors in the"
"Survey  Department  to  engage  in  private  practice.  Secondly,  the  Attorney"
"General was of the view that the entitlement to engage in private practice"
"is 
subject 
to 
the 
conditions 
that 
are 
stipulated 
in 
the  Letters 
of"
