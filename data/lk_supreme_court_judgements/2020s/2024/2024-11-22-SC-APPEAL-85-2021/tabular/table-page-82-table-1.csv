"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"conferred  upon  it  by  Section  41(2)  to  grant  Annual  Practising  Licence  to"
"the members of that group and, in this particular instance, by arriving at a"
"decision, to issue Annual Practising Licences to them, had acted ultra vires"
"of its powers and functions."
"In  addition,  another  factor  contributed  to  the  arbitrariness  of  the"
"Council in making the impugned decision. In terms of Sections 37(c), 41(1)"
"and  41(2),  it  is  a  function  of  the  Council  to  receive  applications  from"
"registered surveyors for the issuance of Annual Practising Licences. These"
"Sections further imposes several criteria, which must first be established to"
"the  satisfaction  of  the  Council  by  such  an  applicant  before  the  Council"
"making  a  decision.  Section  37(c)  states  that  if  the  Council  is  “satisfied  that"
"such surveyors  possess the knowledge and skill to practice the profession of land"
"surveying” only it could issue such licenses. If such surveyors have applied"
"for  licenses  from  the  Council  in  terms  of  Section  41(1),  it  may issue  them"
"with such licenses, if it is “satisfied that he has followed the prescribed courses of"
"study and training approved by the Council and acquired knowledge and skill to"
"practice land surveying”, per Section 41(2)."
"It  could  well  be  that  the  officers  of  SLSS  may  have  acquired  the"
"prescribed  qualifications  or  experience 
the  Sections  speak  of,  but 
in"
"to  practice 
land 
addition 
they  also  must  have 
the  “  ability  and  skills"
"surveying” 
is  another  requirement 
that  should 
  have  been 
taken 
into"
"consideration  by 
the  Council  before  making  a  decision. 
Instead  of"
"assessing  merits  of  each  applicant  to  satisfy 
itself  that  they  had  such"
"“ability and skill”, the Council had decided to take that factor for granted as"
"if  those  applicants  have  automatically  fulfilled  that  requirement    en  bloc."
"Even  if  this  Court  was  to  accept  the  contention  of  the  Respondents  for"
"82"
