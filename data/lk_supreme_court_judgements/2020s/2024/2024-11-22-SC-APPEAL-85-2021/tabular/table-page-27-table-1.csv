"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"of  provisions  of  the  Survey  Act  in  its  current  form  is  to  mean  that  the"
"Parliament  intended  to  depart  from  its  previous  legislative  policy  on  the"
"question  of  ‘private  practice’.    The  reason  for  such  an  absence,  coupled"
"with the Minister’s statement to Parliament on the issue, expressing a view"
"contrary  to  what  the  Respondents  contend  as  the  Act  intended,  could"
"reasonably be inferred to mean that there was no intention on the part of"
"the Parliament to envisage a situation where the Act directly or indirectly"
"permits  such  a  course  of  action  either  by  the  Surveyor  General  or  by  the"
"Land Survey Council."
