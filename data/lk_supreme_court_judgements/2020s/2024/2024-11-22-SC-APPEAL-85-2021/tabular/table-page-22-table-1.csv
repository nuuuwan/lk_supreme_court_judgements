"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"What is important to note from examination of the contents of these"
"correspondences  is  that  the  decision  to  grant  approval  to  the  surveyors"
"employed  in  the  Survey  Department  to  engage  in  private  practice  was"
"taken by the Minister and not by the Secretary, although it was said to be"
"granted  “in  principle”.  Nowhere  in  that  letter  the  Secretary  states  that  he"
"approves the request of the surveyors serving in the Survey Department in"
"terms of the Establishments Code, in spite of the fact that the Section in the"
"Code  speaks  of  a  “sanction”  by  the  Secretary.  It  is  evident  from  these"
"factors  that  the  role  played  by  the  Secretary  in  the  impugned  decision-"
"making process of granting approval is limited to summarising the details"
"of  a  meeting  the  Minister  already  had  with  a  trade  union,  and  making"
"enquiries  from  the  Ministry  of  Health.  It  is  not  clear  who  sought  the"
"opinion of the Hon. Attorney General. The Secretary, in sending that letter"
"out  to  the  Surveyor  General,  has  thereby  acted  as  a  mere  conduit,  after"
"acting  on  the  decision  of  his  Minister,  although  states  that  he  ‘approves’"
"the request."
