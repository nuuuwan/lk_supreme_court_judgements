"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"enactment when it can fairly and properly be construed without attributing it that"
"effect.”"
"The  said  proviso  does  not  extend  the  exception  it  created  for  the"
"registered surveyors to be in the “practice of land surveying”, in addition to"
"their  engagement  of  land  surveying,  as  the  Respondents  contend.  That"
"exception  is limited  only to an engagement in  land surveying and clearly"
"not to recognise an entitlement to  ‘practice’ in land surveying for a fee or"
"reward . Therefore, I am of the considered view that the contention of the"
"Respondent on the proviso to Section 41(1) is not tenable. The proviso, in"
"effect, 
is  a  re-statement  of  what  Section  44(1)(a)  already  provides  for."
"Section 44(1)(a) empowers a registered surveyor to engage in land survey"
"in the service of the Government and as per Section 44(1)(b), should hold"
"an  Annual  Practising  Licence  if  he  is  to  engage  in  the  “practice  of  land"
"surveying  for  fee  or  reward”.  Thus,  when  viewed  in  this  perspective,  the"
"proviso  seemed  a  superfluous  statement  of 
law.  But 
then 
there 
is  a"
"principle of interpretation of statues to the effect that the Legislature does"
"not waste its words. Bindra, (supra) states (at p. 195) that “ [A]n Act should"
"be construed as to avoid redundancy or surplusage. It is no doubt  true that as a"
"general rule Legislatures  may be presumed not to make a superfluous provision."
"But this presumption is not a strong presumption, and it is not uncommon to find"
"the  Legislature  inserting  superfluous  provision  under  the  influence  of  what  may"
"be abundant caution.”"
"In my view, the Legislature opted to insert the proviso under Section"
"41(1)  in  this 
instance,  for  a  very  valid  reason.  That  reason  is  directly"
"attributable to Sections 2(q) and 10(2)(b) of the Act. Section 2  specifies the"
"powers and functions of the Surveyor General. Section 2(q) states that he is"
"49"
