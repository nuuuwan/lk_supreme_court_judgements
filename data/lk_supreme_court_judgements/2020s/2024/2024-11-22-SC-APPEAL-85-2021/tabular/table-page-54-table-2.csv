"However, 
in  recognising  an  exception 
to 
the  rule  contained 
in"
"Section  41(1), 
the  Legislature  omitted 
to  mention 
that  a 
registered"
"surveyor, who  is in employment of the Survey Department and engaged"
"in  land  surveying  under  the  supervision  of  the  Surveyor  General,  shall"
"also be required to obtain an Annual Practising Licence, if he is desirous of"
"practicing or attempting or professing to practise land surveying in terms"
"of  Section  41(1),  but  instead  had  opted  to  word  the  proviso  to  read  that"
"such a surveyor, “shall not be required to obtain an annual practising licence for"
"the  purpose  of  engaging 
in 
land  surveying  on  behalf  of 
the  Government”"
