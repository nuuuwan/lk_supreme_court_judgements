"41(1) should mean to include the registered surveyors, who are engaged in"
"land surveying on behalf of the Government and under the supervision of"
"the Surveyor General, for granting of Annual Practising Licences?"
"If  that  Section  is  taken  for  consideration  in  total  isolation  from  the"
"rest of the provisions that are contained in the Act, the obvious answer to"
"that  question  is  a  one  in  the  affirmative.  But  the  adoption  of  such  an"
"approach,  in  the  determination  of  the  said  question,  would  not  be  in"
"conformity with the accepted rules of interpretation of statutes."
"on  The 
Maxwell, 
in  his  work  on 
this  area  of 
law 
(  Maxwell"
"Interpretation 
of 
Statues, 
12th 
Ed.,), 
describes 
the 
Literal 
Rule 
of"
"Interpretation  of  Statutes  as  follows  (at  p.  28):  “  [I]f  there  is  nothing  to"
"modify,  alter  or  qualify  the  language  which  the  statute  contains,  it  must  be"
"construed  in  the  ordinary  and  natural  meaning of  the  words  and sentences.  The"
"safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take"
"the words themselves and arrive, if possible, at their meaning without, in the first"
"instance, reference to cases.”"
"Section  41(1)  and  41(2), 
  taken  in  isolation  from  the  rest  of  the"
"provisions contained in the Act and taken in its literal meaning, of course"
"does  not 
recognise  any  distinction  between 
the 
registered  surveyors"
"engaged in land surveying and registered surveyors, who engaged in land"
"surveying  on  behalf  of  the  Government  under  the  supervision  of  the"
"Surveyor  General.  However,  as  Maxwell 
  added  a  qualification  to  the"
"application of the Literal Rule by stating “[I]f there is nothing to modify, alter"
"or qualify the language which the statute contains”  and in such a situation that"
"Statute “must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and"
"sentences”. I find that the issue to be determined by this Court with regard"
