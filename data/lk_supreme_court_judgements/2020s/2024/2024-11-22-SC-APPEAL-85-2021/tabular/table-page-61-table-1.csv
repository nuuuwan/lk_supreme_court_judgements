"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"blemishes  disappear  once  they  are  integrated  into  a  common  class  known  as"
"Labour Officer, Grade II.”"
"In relation to the three appeals pending before this Court, it must be"
"observed that with the acquisition of the status “registered surveyors”  after"
"obtaining  registration  with  the  Council  in  terms  of  Sections  37(b)  and"
"39(1),  the  qualified  surveyors,  depending  on  whether  they  ‘engage  in  land"
"surveying’  or  ‘practice  land  surveying’,  are  clearly  divided  into  two  groups."
"Then 
there  was 
a 
further 
subdivision  of 
the 
registered 
surveyors,"
"depending  on  whether  they  ‘engage  in  land  surveying’  or  whether  they"
"‘engage in land surveying on behalf of the Government’."
"However,  when  such  a  “registered  surveyor”  has  decided  to  join  the"
"Survey  Department 
to 
engage 
in 
land 
surveying  on  behalf  of 
the"
"Government under the supervision of Surveyor General, for the purpose of"
"37(c)  of  the  Act,  such  a  surveyor  could  not  be  clubbed  together  as  a"
"registered  surveyor  along  with  the  other  group  of  registered  surveyors,"
"who have decided not to take up employment under the  Government.  In"
"such circumstances, such a surveyor ought to be considered not only as a"
"registered  surveyor,  but  a  registered  surveyor,  who  is  engaged  in  land"
"surveying  on  behalf  of  the  Government  and  therefore  placed  under  the"
"supervision  of  the  Surveyor  General.  This  is  because  such  a  registered"
"surveyor, is not only placed under the disciplinary control of the Council,"
"but  being  a  public  officer, 
is  also  placed  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"Establishments  Code, 
in  addition 
to 
the  supervision  of 
the  Surveyor"
"General, in terms of Section 2(q), which confers authority on him to ensure"
"the  maintenance  of  high  professional  standards 
in  such  a  surveyor’s"
"activities in land surveying in the Survey Department."
