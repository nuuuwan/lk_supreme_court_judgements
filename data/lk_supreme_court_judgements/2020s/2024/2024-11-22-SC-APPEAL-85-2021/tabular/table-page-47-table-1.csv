"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"be  interpreted  to  mean  that  Land  Survey  Council  is  prohibited  from  issuing"
"Annual Practising Licence to Government Surveyors.”"
"In dealing with this particular aspect of the provisions contained in"
"Section  41(1)  and  its  proviso,  I  would  rather  take  the  main  Section  for"
"consideration first, before proceeding to deal with its proviso. The Section"
"made 
it  mandatory  for  every  registered  surveyor,  who 
is  desirous  of"
"practicing or attempting or professing to practice land surveying, to apply"
"to 
the  Council  for  an  Annual  Practising  Licence. 
In 
this  Section, 
the"
"emphasis  given  by  the  Legislature  to  the  act  of  ‘practice  land  surveying’"
"preceded by insertion of the words “… practicing or attempting or professing"
"to …”could not be ignored. In interpreting the Section, these words should"
"be given due weightage deserve to them."
"The  ‘practice’  of  land  surveying,  unlike  its  counterpart  ‘engaging’  in"
"land 
surveying, 
comes  with  more 
responsibilities  attached 
to 
it.  A"
"registered surveyor, who was issued with an Annual Practising Licence, is"
"termed as “ registered licensed surveyor”, and his name should appear in the"
"Register  of  such  surveyors.  Section  45 
  describes  certain  acts  that  are"
"specified 
therein 
as 
acts  of  professional  misconduct 
that 
could  be"
"committed  only  by  a  Registered  Licensed  Surveyor. 
  The  said  Section"
"refers to four of such acts. With regard to registered surveyors, who are in"
"the  service  of  the  Government,  and  for  that  reason,  are  engaged  in  land"
"surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor General, there is only one"
"such  act  that  is  specified  in  the  Section.  With  these  observations,  I  turn"
"now to consider the proviso to Section 41(1)."
"It  is  the  contention  of  the  Respondents  that  the  proviso  of  Section"
"41(1)  recognises 
the  entitlement  of 
the  registered  surveyors,  who  are"
"47"
