"S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021"
"Hevavitharana  v  Themis  de  Silva  (supra)  too  dealt  with  a  situation  in"
"which  an  interpretation  of  a  procedural  law  provision  was  involved.  The"
"judgments that I came across of having acted on the principle referred to in"
"Hevavitharana  v  Themis  de  Silva 
  are 
indicative  of  the  fact  that  the"
"superior  Courts  have  acted  on 
that  principle  only  when 
they  were"
"confronted  with 
the 
task  of  determining  some  aspect  of  a  statutory"
"provision laying down a procedure, either in the Civil Procedure Code or"
"of  the  Partition  Law,  which  necessitated  a  judicial  interpretation.    The"
"judgments  of  Dionis  v  William  Singho  and  Others  (1973)  77  NLR  103,"
"Seneveratne  v  Abeykoon  (1986)  2  Sri  L.R.  1,  Ratnasingham  v  Dissanike"
"and  Others  (1998)  1  Sri  L.R.  8,  Martin  Silva  and  Another  v  Central"
"Engineering  Consultancy  Bureau  and  Another  (2003)  2  Sri  L.R.  228  and"
"Aryaratne  v  Laksiri  Fernando  (2004)  1  Sri  L.R.  184,  are  some  of  these"
"instances."
