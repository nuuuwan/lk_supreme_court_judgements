The dispute presented before this Court for its determination in SC

Appeal Nos. 85, 86 and 87 of 2021, has arisen from the consolidated

judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal on 11.09.2019 in respect of

three applications (CA Writ Application Nos. 98/2012, 682/2011 and

61/2012) that were filed before that Court.

The CA Writ Application No. 98/2012 is an application by which 30

Registered Licensed Surveyors (Petitioner-Appellants), who engage in the

profession of private practice in surveying, have sought inter alia to quash the

decision of the 1st and 3rd Respondent -Respondents to issue Field Staff

Circular No. 05/2011 of 25.11.2011 (P3), by issuance of a Writ of

Certiorari, while also seeking to prohibit the said Respondent-Respondents

from granting Annual Practising Licences to the officers, who are serving

in the Survey Department to engage in private practice, in terms of the

said Circular.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

7

The Petitioner-Appellant in CA Writ Application No. 682/2011 is

the Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka, a statutory body created by the

Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka (Incorporation) Act No. 22 0f 1982, who

also prayed for almost identical reliefs, as did by the Petitioner-Appellants

in CA Writ Application No. 98/2012. The Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka

filed another application before the Court of Appeal (CA Writ Application

No. 61/2012), by which it sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

of the Land Survey Council taken to issue Annual Practising Licences to

the 12th to 70th Respondent-Respondents, who are named therein (P14),

along with a Writ of Prohibition in prohibiting the said Respondent-

Respondents from issuing Annual Practising Licences to serving officers of

the Survey Department to engage in private practice.

In CA Writ Application No. 98/2012, the Petitioner-Appellants have

named only 10 Respondent-Respondents in the caption to their petition,

including the Surveyor General, Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and

Land Development, the Land Surveyor Council and all of its members.

During pendency of the said application before the Court of Appeal, the

Government Surveyors Association intervened and was added as the 11th

Respondent- Respondent by the Court of Appeal on 16.10.2012. A Senior

Superintendent of Surveyor, serving in the Survey Department, K.S.K.

Wijayawardane, too has intervened and named as the 12th Respondent-

Respondent on 16.10.2012, as he too was granted an Annual Practising

Licence, after the issuance of the impugned Field Staff Circular.

The three Respondent-Respondents named in CA Writ Application

No. 682/2011 are the Surveyor General, the Secretary to Ministry of Lands

and Land Development and the Attorney General. The Government

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

8

Surveyors Association and the Secretary of the Survey Department Staff

Officers Union, K.S.K. Wijayawardane, too were added as the 4th and 5th

Respondent-Respondents respectively on 13.03.2012, after their

interventions were allowed.

It is clear from the pleadings that were tendered before the Court of

Appeal by the Petitioner-Appellants in CA Writ Application Nos. 98/2012

and 61/2012, that they seek to challenge the validity of the Field Staff

Circular No. 05/2011 dated 25.11.2011, issued under the hand of the

Surveyor General. In addition, the Petitioner-Appellant in CA Writ

Application No. 682/2011 sought to challenge the legality of the decision

taken by the Land Survey Council (hereinafter referred to as the

Council), at its 103rd meeting held on 09.02.2012 and under item 103.5 of

the agenda, to grant Annual Practising Licences to officers of Sri Lanka

Survey Service.

The relevant minutes indicate that the said issue was taken up for

consideration by the Council and since the views expressed by the

members of the Council were at variance, a vote was taken in terms of the

law. Out of the seven of the Council members, four voted in favour of

granting licences while the remaining three members voted against.

Accordingly, the impugned decision was adopted by the Council by

majority of votes. The members of the Council, who voted against the said

decision too are named as Respondents.

In order to ensure clarity and consistency in the presentation of this

judgment, the collective body of the Petitioner-Appellants, who espoused

a common cause, shall be referred hereinafter as the Petitioners and the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

9

multitude of Respondent-Respondents who resisted the same, are referred

to as the Respondents.

The Surveyor General, the Land Survey Council, the Government

Surveyors Association, and the 12th to 70th Respondents ( in CA Writ

Application No. 61/2012), have filed their individual Statement of

Objections. Three members of the Council ( 7th, 8th and 9th Respondents in

CA Writ Application No. 98/2012 and 6th, 7th and 8th Respondents in CA

Writ Application No. 61/2012, respectively) who voted against the

impugned decision of the Land Survey Council, also tendered their own

Statements of Objections, supporting the Petitioners claim. Hence, the

claim of these three Respondents shall be considered along with that of the

Petitioners, after they being separated from the rest of the other

Respondents, who strongly opposed the three applications. Hence, the

reference to the Petitioners in this judgment includes these three

Respondents, whereas the reference the Respondents is used to denote

all the remaining Respondents, who opposed the three applications of the

Petitioners.

After affording a hearing to all the parties, the Court of Appeal, by

its amalgamated judgment dated 11.09.2019, refused to grant relief to any

of the Petitioners and proceeded to dismiss the three petitions. Therefore,

the Petitioners have sought Special Leave to Appeal against the said

judgment in three separate applications bearing numbers SC (Spl) LA Nos.

376/2019, 380/2019 and 382/2019, respectively.

On 14.10.2021, this Court, upon hearing the Petitioners as well as the

Respondents, decided to grant Special Leave to Appeal against the said

impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal on following questions of law,

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

10

and made them applicable to all three SC (Spl) L.A. Application Nos

376/2019, 380/2019 and 382/2019:

1. Whether or not Government Surveyors can do private

practice in terms of Survey Act No. 17 of 2002 ?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to appreciate

whether the issuance of the impugned circular is irrational

and/or arbitrary and /or unreasonable ?

3. Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider the impact of the

other Statues such as Land Registration Act, Title

Registration Act and Partition Law when considering

reasonableness of the impugned circular ?

4(a). Does the circular fall within the purview or provisions

of Survey Act No. 17 of 2002 ?

4(b). If so, can the circular be challenged on the question of

law formulated in Questions of Law Nos. 2 and 3

above?

After Special leave to Appeal was granted, the three SC (Spl) L.A.

Application Nos 376/2019, 380/2019 and 382/2019 were renumbered as

SC Appeal No. 85/2021, SC Appeal No. 86/2021 and SC Appel No.

87/2021, respectively. In view of the fact that the questions of law are

common to all appeals, a consolidated judgment is pronounced by this

Court in respect of the said three appeals, which shall be binding on all

parties to SC Appeal No. 85/2021, SC Appeal No. 86/2021 and SC Appel

No. 87/2021. It must be noted in this respect that most of the documents

relied on by the Petitioners in their three petitions are common to all and,

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

11

in the circumstances, in making references to them in this judgment, rather

than identifying them with the different markings given to them by each

Petitioner, I have opted to refer to their description and content, in order to

avoid any confusion or ambiguity.

On 04.03.2024, hearing of the three appeals was commenced before

this Court and the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners made

their submissions, which continued for several days. At the conclusion of

the submissions for the Petitioners, learned Presidents Counsel, learned

Counsel and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents also

made their submissions, and an opportunity was provided for the

Petitioners to make a concise reply.

Since I intend to refer to the submissions made by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners as well as the Respondents in detail

as we progress along the judgment, at this moment of time, and for the

purpose of setting out the main points that require consideration by this

Court, I intend to make references to those submissions albeit briefly.

The Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeal erred in law, in its

failure to appreciate whether the issuance of the impugned circular is

arbitrary and unreasonable, for the reasons:

a. that the intention of the Parliament in the enactment of the

Surveys Act No. 17 of 2002 was not to permit the surveyors

serving in the Survey Department to engage in private

practice,

b. that the Land Survey Council acted arbitrarily and

unreasonably in arriving at its decision to grant Annual

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

12

Practising Licences to the surveyors serving in the Survey

Department to engage in private practice, in view of the

dichotomy that exists between Registered Surveyors and

Registered Licensed Surveyors, as recognised by the said

Act,

c. that the Circular falls outside the parameters of the Surveys

Act No. 17 of 2002,

d. that the impugned circular granted blanket approval of

Government Surveyors to engage in private practice,

contrary to the provisions of the Establishments Code,

e. that the adverse impact of the impugned decision had on

other statutes, such as Land Acquisition Act, Registration

of Title Act and Partition Act, created by the impugned

Circular,

The Respondents, defending the judgment of the Court of Appeal,

contended that:

a. there are no legal impediments created by the Survey Act

No. 17 of 2002, preventing the surveyors, who are serving

in the Survey Department, to engage in private practice,

b. the Section 44 of the said Act must be construed in such a

manner to give effect to the intention of the Legislature in

permitting private practice,

c. the decision of the Council was reached in terms of the law

and on the majority view,

d. the issuance of the Field Staff Circular is not ultra vires the

powers of the Surveyor General,

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

13

e. the issuance of the said Circular was in recognition of the

right to engage in lawful occupation in terms of Article

14(1)(g).

It is evident from the perusal of these multiple contentions

presented by the Petitioners that they collectively challenge the validity of

the Field Staff Circular No. 5/2011issued by the Surveyor General and the

decision of the Council to issue Annual Practising Licences to registered

surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the

Government, along with questioning the validity of the decision-making

process adopted by the relevant Respondents in relation to these two

instances.

Therefore, I shall consider the validity of the issuance of the Field

Staff Circular No. 5/2011 first and, thereafter, proceed to consider the

validity of the proceedings of the Council, which culminated in the

decision to issue licences to some of the Respondents, in the light of the

line of reasoning adopted by the Court below in respect of these two

issues.

The approval by the Secretary the Ministry of Lands and Land

Development

One of the two main points that was urged quite strongly before this

Court by the 1st to 3rd Respondents in their submissions defending the

judgment of the Court of Appeal was that neither the Act nor the

Establishments Code placed any fetters on the rights the Surveyors in Sri

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

14

Lanka Surveyors Service to engage in private practice, who are

registered surveyors, and employed in the Survey Department. Hence, it

was submitted by the Respondents that the challenge mounted by the

Petitioners to the legal validity of the Field Staff Circular No. 05/2011,

which was issued with permission of the Secretary to the Ministry of

Lands and Land Development in terms of the Establishments Code and,

the decision of the Council to grant Annual Practising Licences to the

members of the said Service in terms of the Survey Act, is totally

misconceived in law. They further contended that the Petitioners have

come before Court for a collateral purpose and acted in mala fides to

advance the interests of private surveyors and thereby prejudice the rights

of those who are legitimately entitled to obtain such a licence.

Before I proceed to examine the validity of the issuance of the Field

Staff Circular, the Respondents contention, that both the Survey Act and

the Establishments Code place no fetters on their entitlement to private

practice, should be examined first, in the light of the relevant provisions

contained in the Act as well as the Code.

Of the two components of the said contention referring to the Act

and the Establishments Code, it is prudent to start the examination of the

provisions that are relevant to the issue as contained in that Code before

proceeding to consider them in the Act. With that objective in mind, I now

turn to refer to the relevant provisions of the Establishments Code.

Chapter XXX of the Establishments Code is titled Rights of

Government over its Officers, and Section 1:1 of that Chapter states that

[T]he Government has total claim to the time, knowledge, talents and skills of its

officers and their salary is fixed on that assumption, unless specifically provided

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

15

for otherwise. It is therefore clear that the Code does not approve in

principle that the public officers to make available their time, knowledge,

talents and skills for other entities for a fee or reward, unless specifically

provided for otherwise. The Establishments Code indicate the reason for

such a limitation as it clarifies that the salary component of public officers

was determined on the assumption that the Government has total claim

to the time, knowledge, talents and skills of its officers.

But it must be noted that is not an absolute prohibition. There are

exceptions made to this rule recognised by the Establishment Code itself.

In relation to the instant appeals, Section 1: 4 of the Code becomes

relevant. The said Section states that [T]he permission of the Secretary is

required before an officer may undertake for a fee any work outside his normal

official duties. The process by which a public officer could undertake any

work outside his normal official duties for a fee, is set out in Section 1:3.

That Section states that [A]n officer may not undertake any service for a Local

Government Body, Public Corporation or other body, or for any private party,

without previously obtaining the sanction of the Secretary.

The Respondents therefore placed reliance on a series of

correspondence between the Surveyor General and the Secretary to the

Ministry of Lands and Land Development, in order to impress upon the

Courts of the legality of the process, which culminated with the issuance of

the impugned circular under the hand of the Surveyor General, permitting

them to engage in private practice.

These documents include:

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

16

a. Letter issued by the Minister of Lands and Land Development

dated 29.06.2011 to the President of Government Surveyors

Union,

b. Letter dated 11.11.2011, issued by the Secretary to the Ministry

of Lands and Land Development to the Surveyor General

conveying that the Minister has granted permission to engage in

private practice by making reference to a letter date 13.11.2011,

c. Recommendation addressed to the Minister of Lands and Land

Development by the Secretary of that Ministry dated 13.11.2011,

d. Letter issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Land

Development dated 25.11.2011,

e. The Field Staff Circular No. 05/2011 of 25.11.2011 .

The Petitioners, on the other hand, accused the Secretary of the

Ministry merely acted under the dictation of his Minister in issuing the

said letter. Therefore, they contended that the issuance of the said circular

is tainted with an illegality, as the Secretary has failed to exercise the

discretion conferred upon him by the Establishments Code in this regard

and instead of exercising that discretion by himself, allowed himself to be

subjugated to the dictates of his Minister by issuing the letter dated

25.11.2011.

The current dispute arose as a result of the claim made by the

surveyors, who are employed in the Survey Department, asserting their

entitlement to engage in private practice, whilst being in employment in

the said Department. The surveyors, who already are engaged private

practice naturally opted to resist this claim. In the circumstances, it would

offer some assistance to consider the dispute presented before us in its

proper perspective, if the starting point, at which the surveyors in the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

17

Survey Department claimed of their entitlement to engage in private

practice, is traced.

Perusal of the pleadings before the Court below indicate that the

agitation of the surveyors, who are employed in the Survey Department,

seeking permission to engage in private practice, has a long history. In

December 1991, the then Minister of Land, Irrigation and Mahaweli

Development, by way of a memorandum addressed to the Cabinet of

Ministers, sought its approval to grant such approval. At the time of

presentation of the said Cabinet Memorandum, the Survey Ordinance was

applicable to the affairs of all the surveyors, who are employed in the

Survey Department as well as to the others, who already engaged in

private practice. The Cabinet of Ministers have approved the said

memorandum and, as a consequence of which, the Field Staff Circular No.

05/1992 dated 05.02.1992, was issued by the then Surveyor General.

The validity of the issuance of the said Field Staff Circular by the

Surveyor General (1st Respondent in that application) was challenged

before the Court of Appeal by the Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka. The

C.A. Application 336/1992 by which the said Institute sought to quash the

said circular by way of a Writ of Certiorari and also sought to prevent the

Surveyor General from calling for applications by way of a Writ of

Prohibition. The Court of Appeal refused the application and accordingly

the petition of Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka was dismissed. In

challenging the said dismissal, the Institute obtained Special Leave from

this Court, against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

In the resultant appeal before this Court, bearing SC Appeal No.

60/94 (decided on 05.10.1994) , Kulatunga J, allowed the appeal of the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

18

Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka on the premise that the Field Staff

Circular No. 05/92 dated 05.02.92 is ultra vires and its implementation is in

excess of the 1st Respondents power to grant annual licences to land surveyors

under the Ordinance. Since the pronouncement of the said judgment, no

attempt was made by the Surveyors, employed in the Survey Department,

to explore the possibility of finding an alternative legally viable option to

achieve their objective.

The new Survey Act was certified on 04.10.2002. After coming into

operation, the Act repealed the Surveyors Ordinance, that governed all the

affairs of land surveying, by Section 25(1)(a). The time gap of almost nine

years that has elapsed between the enactment of the Act and the revival of

the agitation for seeking permission to engage in private practice, which

lead to the instant process of litigation, therefore becomes relevant. It

appears from their conduct that the members of the union that it had

accepted Act made no changes to the status quo ante, regarding the

restriction imposed on its members to engage in private practice,

subsequent to the pronouncement of the said judgment of this Court.

It is evident from the pleadings that the surveyors, who are

employed in the Survey Department, make an attempt to revive their

claim to engage in private practice only in the year 2011. That too was

made by way of a trade Union action. The Minister of Land and Land

Development then issues a letter addressed to the trade Union. The

contents of that letter indicate that, in order to avert a prospect of a strike

action by the surveyors of the Survey Department, the then Minister of

Lands decided to issue a letter dated 29.06.2011 addressed to the President

of Government Surveyors Union. What is important to note in this letter is

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

19

that it indicates in no uncertain terms that it was the Minister who decided

to grant permission for the members of that Union to engage in private

practice.

After these events that had taken place in the Month of June 2011,

the Secretary to the Ministry, by his letter dated 13.11.2011, sought

approval of his Minister for his approval to the surveyors, who are

employed in the Survey Department, to engage in private practice. In that

letter, the Secretary refers to a prior discussion they had with the Union

and reminds his Minister of the fact that he (the Minister) has already

approved the said request in principle. The Secretary also refers to an

opinion expressed by the Attorney General, and supports the decision

already taken by the Minister, by adding that he personally verified from

the Secretary to the Ministry of Health as to the basis on which the

Government Medical Officers were granted permission to engage in

private practice and found out that it has been granted with the approval

of the Minister of Health. The Minister makes an endorsement, on his

Secretarys request for permission, as approved.

The said letter of the Secretary also refers to several areas of concern

expressed by the Attorney General in his opinion on the question of

permitting private practice to surveyors in the Survey Department. The

opinion of the Attorney General covered three aspects. First, it states that

there is no express prohibition imposed by the Act for the surveyors in the

Survey Department to engage in private practice. Secondly, the Attorney

General was of the view that the entitlement to engage in private practice

is subject to the conditions that are stipulated in the Letters of

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

20

Appointment issued to surveyors of the Department and also conform to

the policy of the Government.

In relation to the issue under discussion, it must be highlighted that

the clear advice given by the Attorney General was there must be a policy

decision taken in this regard by the Government, meaning a decision taken

by the Cabinet of Ministers, and not the Minister in charge of land and

land development. This condition also presupposes that there was no

policy decision made by the Government in granting permission to the

surveyors of the Survey Department to engage in private practice. It is

rather strange that none of the parties thought it fit to produce a single

letter of appointment issued to a surveyor, who is employed in the Survey

Department, in their pleadings, and facilitating the Courts to have an

understanding of the exact terms and conditions that are stipulated therein

in relation to their scope of employment. If the contents of the Letters of

Appointment support the Respondents position, then it is obvious that

they would have relied on them by bringing them to the notice of Court.

It must also be noted in this context that the Secretary, in informing

his Minister of the basis on which the Government Medical Officers were

permitted to engage in private practice by the Secretary to Ministry of

Health, upon the concurrence of the relevant Minister, made a rather

misleading statement to his Minister which even could be considered as

contrary to the express provisions that contained in the Establishments

Code that govern the issue of private practice of health professionals. This

is because, the provisions contained in Section 1:4 were made inapplicable

to them by that Code.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

21

Section 1:5 of the Establishments Code states Sub-section 1:4 and 1:6

will not apply to cases authorised under Chapter IX of this Code and to officers of

a Department (e.g., Health) who are governed by the regulations and instructions

of that Department regarding private practice and consultation practice. Hence,

in terms of the applicable provisions of the Establishments Code, the case

of surveyors, who are employed in the Survey Department, could not be

equated with that of the health professionals, as the applicable provisions

of the Code, in relation to permitting private practice, are quite different to

each other.

Now I turn my attention to the letter of the Secretary dated

11.11.2011, addressed to the Surveyor General, permitting the latter to

issue the impugned circular. In the said letter, although dated 11.11.2011,

the Secretary makes a reference to another letter dated 13.11.2011, which

he himself authored. That is the letter on which the Minister has made an

endorsement, approved. It is on the strength of this letter only the

Surveyor General issued the impugned Field Staff Circular No. 05/2011

dated 25.11.2011. How is the letter dated 11.11.2011 makes a reference to a

letter issued two days later ?

The Secretary in the joint Statement of Objections, in which the 1st

and 3rd Respondents too joined with him to affirm, offered no explanation

for this strange mix up of dates. Whether the said inaccurate reference

made to dates due to a genuine mistake made on the part of the Secretary

or whether it is a result of a hurried attempt made to justify a decision

already taken and implemented, could not be assessed properly for the

purpose of expressing a definitive finding on either way.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

22

What is important to note from examination of the contents of these

correspondences is that the decision to grant approval to the surveyors

employed in the Survey Department to engage in private practice was

taken by the Minister and not by the Secretary, although it was said to be

granted in principle. Nowhere in that letter the Secretary states that he

approves the request of the surveyors serving in the Survey Department in

terms of the Establishments Code, in spite of the fact that the Section in the

Code speaks of a sanction by the Secretary. It is evident from these

factors that the role played by the Secretary in the impugned decision-

making process of granting approval is limited to summarising the details

of a meeting the Minister already had with a trade union, and making

enquiries from the Ministry of Health. It is not clear who sought the

opinion of the Hon. Attorney General. The Secretary, in sending that letter

out to the Surveyor General, has thereby acted as a mere conduit, after

acting on the decision of his Minister, although states that he approves

the request.

This factor is, as rightly contended by the Petitioners, could easily be

equated to a situation, in which the Secretary had acted under the dictation

of his Minister. It is the Secretary who, in terms of Section 1:4 of the

Establishment Code, should have taken the decision on the

request/demand made by the Union of the surveyors, employed in

Survey Department, to engage in private practice, but as the documentary

evidence referred to above indicate that it was the Minister who in fact had

taken that decision, when that Union had threatened him with an

imminent strike action.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

23

On the submission of the Petitioners that the Secretary acted on the

dictation of his Minister, it is relevant to note that De Smiths Judicial

Review, 8th Edition, states (at p.338) that [A]n authority entrusted with a

discretion must not, in the purported exercise of its discretion, act under the

dictation of another body or person. In at least two Commonwealth cases,

licensing bodies were found to have taken decision on the instructions of the head

of Government who were prompted by extraneous motives. Learned author

continues by adding that it is enough to show that a decision which ought

to have been based on the exercise of independent judgment was dictated by those

who are not entrusted with the power to decide. In this instance of course,

there is no decision taken by the Secretary in terms of Section 1:4 of the

Establishment Code at all, but as already noted, the decision was taken by

the Minister, who was not entrusted with power to decide the issue.

There is another important aspect that arise from this set of

circumstances, which also impinges on the validity of this decision. This

decision of the Minister was taken during a discussion he has had with the

relevant trade union and in the presence of ministry officials on 29.06.2011.

The decision is primarily regarding the terms and conditions of

employment applicable to the registered surveyors, who are employed in

the Survey Department. They are public officers. But, by then, the 18th

Amendment to the Constitution was in operation and the Article 55 of the

Constitution was substituted with a new Article. The new substituted

Article 55(1) was applicable at the time of the said decision taken by the

Minister.

Article 55(1) reads as follows:

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

24

[T]he Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all

matters of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating

to appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and

dismissal.

There cannot be question whether the surveyors, who are employed

in the Survey Department, should be permitted to engage in private

practice is a decision that should be taken based on a policy. Therefore,

that decision concerns a matter well within the scope of activity

demarcated by Article 55(1) and should have been taken by the Cabinet of

Ministers, and not by the Minister, in his capacity of being in charge of

subjects of land and land development.

The Petitioners relied on the speech made by the then Minister of

Lands, whilst presenting the Bill to the Parliament, as reported in the

Hansard of 25.07.2002, in support of their contention that the new Act, in no

way was intended to authorise the surveyors, who are employed in the

Survey Department, to engage in private practice. The relevant part of the

speech made by the Minister in Parliament, during which he made a

reference to the question of private practice, was highlighted by the

Petitioners before this Court.

The text of Hansard of 25.07.2002 the Parliament, which reads (at p.

1924), is as follows:

rcfha kskafo`rejkag fm!oa.,sl wxYfha jev lrkakg fuysoS fldfy;au

When a new enactment is brought in, replacing another, certain

rules of interpretation apply. Bindra, (at p. 209) states [I]t is a well-settled

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

25

rule of construction that when a statute is repealed and re-enacted, and words in

the repealed statute are reproduced in the new statute, they should be interpreted

in the sense which had been judicially put on them in the repealed Act, because the

Legislature is presumed to be acquainted with the construction which the Courts

have put upon the words, and when they repeat the same words, they must be

taken to have accepted the interpretation put on them by the Court as correctly

reflecting the legislative mind.

Section 4 of the Surveyors Ordinance conferred authority on the

Surveyor General to grant annual licenses to practice as a land

surveyor. Thus, the reference to the issuance of Annual Practising

Licences and permitting surveyors to engage in the practice of land

survey are common to the repealed and re-enacted statutes. In SC Appeal

No. 60/94, Kulathunga J, declared the assumed power of the Surveyor

General to permit his employees, who too are qualified surveyors, to

engage in private practice is ultra vires of his powers, overriding the view

taken by the Court of Appeal that it is intra vires. In that matter, the Court

of Appeal was of the view that a surveyor who currently serving in the

Survey Department too is entitled to obtain an annual licence for private

practice under Section 4 read with Section 6(1) of the Ordinance, on the

basis that the words any person who has served in the Survey Department in

paragraph 9 of the Schedule may not necessarily be limited to persons who

had previously served and therefore ceased to hold such office.

Kulatunga J, went on to state that:

[I] am satisfied that the effect of Section 18 is clearly to confine the

persons exempted by Section 6 from the requirement of having to

pass the examination, to persons mentioned in paragraph 9 of the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

26

Schedule who have ceased to hold office in the Survey Department. I

agree that the Court below has misdirected itself by interpreting the

Schedule independent of Section 6, in the result, it failed to consider

the impact on Section 18 on Section 6.

Thus, it is clear that the pronouncement made by this Court in SC

Appeal No. 60/94 is that only the surveyors, who ceased to hold office in

the Survey Department could be considered to be permitted to engage in

private practice by issuance of a practicing license and not the surveyors,

who are currently in its employment.

The Legislature, in enacting the Survey Act by repealing the

Surveyors Ordinance, and if it intended to depart from the scheme that

contained in the Ordinance in relation to the question of entitlement to

private practice, in relation to surveyors, who are employed in the Survey

Department, had the opportunity to provide specifically for that situation.

This is because, this Court by its pronouncement already made it clear that

the provisions of the Ordinance had no statutory provision to issue the

Field Staff Circular No. 05/1992, although there too was no specific

statutory provision to prohibit the Surveyor General from issuing such a

Circular and thereby making a conferment of an opportunity on his

officers to engage in private practice. That being the legal regime that was

in place prior to the enactment of the Survey Act, if the Parliament was of

the view that a reversal of that policy is needed, then it should have made

that shift of policy by incorporating a statutory provision which enable the

concerned authorities to grant such permission as a positive

pronouncement of the Legislative policy. Certainly, in the absence of such

a positive expression, it could not be reasonable to infer that the enactment

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

27

of provisions of the Survey Act in its current form is to mean that the

Parliament intended to depart from its previous legislative policy on the

question of private practice. The reason for such an absence, coupled

with the Ministers statement to Parliament on the issue, expressing a view

contrary to what the Respondents contend as the Act intended, could

reasonably be inferred to mean that there was no intention on the part of

the Parliament to envisage a situation where the Act directly or indirectly

permits such a course of action either by the Surveyor General or by the

Land Survey Council.

Therefore, the Legislative scheme presented with the Survey Act,

could safely be termed as representing the current policy of the

Government as determined by the Cabinet of Ministers. When the Cabinet

of Ministers approved the provisions of the Act in the form of a Bill , its

approved of the text contained in that Bill, is an endorsement of the

underlying policy considerations, on which it was originally drafted. If

that original policy considerations should be deviated from, that shift of

policy must originate from the Cabinet of Ministers itself. When the

Parliament, by enacting that Bill into law, makes it the Legislative policy.

Therefore, it is for the Parliament to make its intentions clear, if it were to

deviate from that policy.

Even for the sake of argument, if it is to be assumed that the

Secretary of the Ministry of Lands and Land Development had in fact

granted permission to the surveyors, who are employed in the Survey

Department to engage in private practice in terms of Section 1:4 of the

Establishments Code, that permission in itself would not be sufficient for

them to engage in private practice. Section 44(1)(b) of the Act states that

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

28

only a registered surveyor, who holds an Annual Practising Licence, may

engage in the practice of land surveying for a fee or reward. Section 41 of

the Act empowers the Council to grant Annual Practising Licences to those

of who seeks to practice land surveying, among the registered surveyors.

Thus, it is with a licence only a registered surveyor could engage in the

practice of land surveying and not on a Circular issued by his head of the

Department.

Furthermore, in terms of the Establishments Code, there is no right,

or an entitlement conferred on public officers to engage in private practice,

whilst holding office. I have already referred to the fact that the relevant

Secretary of the Ministry, under whom the particular officers are placed, is

conferred with a discretionary power to decide, if such a request is made

and that too in the instances where the attendant requirements that

stipulated in the Code are satisfied. It is undoubtedly a privilege afforded

to public officers and no officer could demand to engage in private

practice as of right or as an entitlement during his tenure of office.

It is clear from the perusal of these statutory provisions contained in

the Act that no registered surveyor, whilst engaged in land surveying on

behalf of the Government, could practice land surveying for fee or reward

without obtaining a valid Annual Practising Licence, even if he is

permitted to undertake for a fee any work outside his normal official duties by

the Secretary, in terms of Section 1:4 of the Establishments Code. The

permission of the Secretary therefore would only be helpful to such a

surveyor only to the extent to shield himself from any disciplinary

proceedings for engaging in private practice, without obtaining prior

sanction.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

29

What the Petitioners of SC Appeal Nos. 85/2021 and 86/2021 have

sought from the Court of appeal as a relief in their prayer was to quash the

Field Staff Circular No. 05/2011, issued by the Surveyor General on

25.11.2011. In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding section of

this judgment, I have already arrived at the conclusion that the

permission granted by the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Land

Development by his letter dated 11.11.2011 has no legal validity. The Field

Staff Circular No. 05/2011 was issued by the Surveyor General, only on

the strength of that letter, as the said Circular made a reference to the letter

of the Secretary dated 11.11.2011, which granted authorisation to the

request to engage in private practice made by the registered surveyors,

who are employed in the Survey Department.

The extensive powers and functions that conferred on the Surveyor

General are set out in Section 2 of the Act. However, there is no mention of

any power or function by which the Surveyor General could permit his

subordinate officers, who engage in land surveying, to switch to practice in

land surveying. Hence, there is no need to re-emphasis the fact that if the

very letter of authority, on which the Circular was issued, has no validity

in the eyes of law, as a consequence the circular issued on that letter of

authority too loses its validity. Hence, in view of this reasoning the said

Petitioners are entitled to have the said circular quashed.

Whether the Registered Surveyors and Registered Licensed Surveyors

belong to two classes of surveyors

The remaining point of the two points urged by the Petitioners is

that the dichotomy that exists between Registered Surveyors and

Registered Licensed Surveyors, as recognised by the provisions of the said

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

30

Act, is a fundamental factor, which the Court of Appeal failed to consider

in its proper perspective.

In Sri Lanka, surveying activities were statutorily regulated since the

latter part of the 18th Century, as the Ordinance No. 15 of 1889 (Chapter

108), was enacted to provide for the licensing of Surveyors. This Ordinance

continued to govern the surveying activities in this island for over two

centuries, until it was repealed by the enactment of the Survey Act.

The Act, in turn provided an interpretation to the phrase land

survey in Section 66 and used the same throughout in the text, which

reads as follows:

(a) the determination or establishment for boundary purposes of

the form, contour, position, area, shape, height, depth, or

nature of any part of the earth or of any natural or artificial

features, and the position, length and direction of bounding

lines on, below, or above any part of the earth;

(b) the determination or establishment of the extent of any right

or interest in land or in air space;

(c) the determination of the location of any feature relative to a

boundary for the purpose of certifying the location of that

feature; and includes;

(i) cadastral surveying;

(ii) compiling a network of any order of precision;

(iii) preparation of any plan or map; and

(iv) establishing photogrammetric ground controls,

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

31

for the purpose of the functions specified in paragraph (a), (b)

and (c).

The term Cadastral survey too is defined in the said Section as any

survey for the purpose of delineating, determining or defining the

boundaries of any parcel of land or premises or any legal rights or interests

attached thereto while the term, aerial survey, is defined as the science of

obtaining measurements by means of aerial photography. These multiple

definitions provided by the Act do amply illustrate the full spectrum of

activities, known as land surveying. Being an island nation, it is

superfluous to highlight the importance of the function defined as land

surveying and its impact on the larger community of Sri Lankans. Hence,

the necessity for the activities related to surveying to be regulated in a

statutorily laid down scheme.

The Act, in its long title states inter alia that it is an Act to provide for

the establishment of a Land Survey Council (hereinafter referred to as the

Council) to regulate the professional conduct of Surveyors, and

accordingly the individuals who have acquired knowledge and skill of

surveying were expected to conform to the scheme put in place by the Act,

if they are to engage in land surveying in Sri Lanka.

A closer examination of the said reveals that a clear distinction could

be identified in terms of the physical act of surveying. The phraseology

used in the Act to denote one such form of activity is to engage in land

surveying (bv uekqlrKh), whereas the other activity referred to in the Act

describes the same as practice land surveying (bv uekSf jD;a;Sh). These

distinct words used by the Legislature, engage in land surveying and

practice land surveying, in describing the otherwise identical acts of land

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

32

surveying to denote two distinct forms of surveying, needs further

examination.

If one were to engage in land surveying, in terms of Section 39(1)

of the Act, he must first obtain registration with the Council and only after

a Certificate of Registration is issued by that Council, he could engage in

land surveying. It is imperative for such an individual to possess the

qualifications specified in the Schedule to the Act, if he was to be grant

with registration. Only such surveyors are termed as registered

surveyors. In Sections 2(q), 37(a), 37(d), 37(g), 37(h), 39(1), 39(2), 39(4),

41(3), 44(1)(q) and 47(1), are the places, where the phrase engage in land

surveying was used in the text, could be found.

On the other hand, the phrase practice land surveying could be

found in Sections 37(c), 44(1)(b), 45(1)(b), 47(1)(e), 54(1) and, in Section

64(1)(e)(i) the phrase practices and surveying for fee or reward is used

instead of the phrase practice land surveying . Thus, the deliberate use

of these two phrases to denote a common act of land surveying, should

obviously be to serve a particular purpose, which the Legislature intended

to achieve by the enactment of the Act.

In the interpretation Section (Section 66), the Act defines two

categories of surveyors. First, it defines a registered surveyor as a person

registered by the Council under this Act. Secondly, the Section also defines

a registered licensed surveyor as a registered surveyor who was issued

with an Annual Practising Licence. It is noted that in the second instance, a

registered licensed surveyor is issued with an Annual Practising Licence,

whereas a registered surveyor is only issued with a Certificate of

Registration and that too is only to engage in land surveying. This is an

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

33

instance which could be taken as affording recognition to two different

groups from the individuals, who have acquired the required

qualifications in surveying, by highlighting a distinction between the two,

is statutory terms.

In this regard, it is necessary that the statutory provisions that

clearly set out the distinction between engage in land surveying and

practice land surveying, are referred to as this stage and in its proper

context.

I have already referred to Section 39(1) earlier on but wish to

reproduce the subsection 39(4) at this stage too, as it sheds some light on

this particular aspect as well. Section 39(4) reads thus:

[T]he Council may, on an application received in that behalf by a

person engaged in or proposing to engage in land surveying and on

production of evidence of good character and payment of the

prescribed fee, register such person where the Council is satisfied

that such person has the qualifications and experience and skills to

engage in land surveying.

In contrast to the provisions contained in Section 39(1), and in

relation to practice land surveying, Section 41(1) states:

[E]very registered surveyor who is desirous of practising or

attempting or professing to practise land surveying, shall apply to

the Council for an annual practising licence.

The manner in which an application of a registered surveyor to

practise land surveying should be considered by the Council too is laid

down in Section 41(2) as that subsection states:

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

34

[T]he Council may on application received in that behalf by a

registered surveyor accompanied by the prescribed fee, issue to such

surveyor an annual practising licence where the Council is satisfied

that he has followed the prescribed courses of study and training

approved by the Council and acquired knowledge and skill to

practise land surveying.

Section 44(1)(b) in turn authorises any registered surveyor, who

holds an Annual Practising License, in addition to a Certificate of

Registration, that he may engage in the practice of land surveying.

In view of these explicit statutory provisions, it is clear that the

qualifications one must satisfy, in order to be qualified to receive a

Certificate of Registration by the Council to engage in land surveying and

to be issued with an Annual Practising Licence to practice land surveying,

are quite different from one another. This differentiation seems to be in

line with the Legislative scheme put in place by the Act by recognition of

two groups, one as registered surveyors and the other as registered

licensed surveyors.

In connection with this division, the Petitioners contend that the Act

expects the Council to maintain two separate registers, each of which the

names of the registered surveyors and registered licensed surveyors are

entered into. The Court of Appeal was not impressed with that contention

as it had preferred to aligned with the view that the purpose of

maintaining two registers was simply because all the Registered

Surveyors do not wish to and are not required to compulsorily register as

Registered Licensed Surveyors. I shall consider this contention, and the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

35

conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal on it in detail, but at a later

point of time.

It is also to be observed from a closer examination of the provisions

of the Act that there exists a more significant difference between the

activity that is termed as engage in land surveying from the practice of land

surveying. This is due to the fact that Section 44(1)(b) states that the

registered surveyors, who practice of land surveying and holds an Annual

Practising Licence, are entitled to engage in the practice of land surveying

for fee or reward. Thus, in addition to the differences that were already

referred to in this judgment, it could be stated with certainty that the

primary feature distinguishing between engage in land surveying from the

practice of land surveying is the entitlement of the registered licensed

surveyors to receive a fee or reward instead of a fixed monthly

remuneration for carrying out their professional work. In fact, it is relevant

to observe in this context and in terms of Section 64(1)(e)(i), the Act

criminalises the conduct of any person (inclusive that of registered

surveyors), who, not being a registered licensed surveyor, to engage in

practices and surveying for fee or reward.

In this backdrop of statutory scheme, it is appropriate at this stage to

remind ourselves of the nature of the core issue between the Petitioners

and the Respondents. That is whether the Act expressly prohibits the

Council from granting Annual Practising Licence to registered surveyors,

who are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government, who

would also be then able to practice land surveying for a fee or reward,

whilst being employed in the Survey Department. This particular group of

surveyors are registered surveyors, who could engage in land surveying

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

36

in terms of the applicable provisions of the Act and thereupon opted to

engage in land surveying on behalf of the Government as public officers

employed by the Survey Department and under the supervision of the

Surveyor General, instead of choosing the option to practice land

surveying for a fee or reward.

The Respondents, who very strongly resisted the applications filed

by the Petitioners before the Court of Appeal and in the appeals pending

before this Court, contended that Section 41 makes no such distinction

between any registered surveyor, employed by the Survey Department,

from any other registered surveyor who is not and, as such, the Council,

upon an application received by any registered surveyor, irrespective of

whether he is engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government or

not, could issue an Annual Practising Licence on such surveyor. Learned

DSG, who appeared for the 1st to 3rd Respondents, during his submissions

strongly stressed before this Court that the words every registered

surveyor that appear in Section 41(1) is an unambiguous term used by the

Legislature that supports the Respondents contention.

Thus, the dispute presented before the Court of Appeal by the

contesting parties for a determination could be narrowed down to read

whether the Council is empowered to grant Annual Practising Licences to

registered surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the

Government, in terms of Section 41(2).

It is already noted that the Petitioners claim that, in the absence of a

positive power conferred by the statute to do so, the Council, in deciding

to grant Annual Practising Licences to registered surveyors, who are

engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government, acted ultra vires of

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

37

its statutorily demarcated scope of power. Refuting that claim, the

Respondents (except the 7th, 8th, 9th and 11th Respondents) contended

before that Court, in the absence of an express prohibition to the contrary,

they are entitled to be issued with an Annual Practising Licences to

commence their practice of land surveying for a fee or reward.

Registered Surveyors, who engage in land surveying on behalf of the

Government

I have already adverted to the fact that the Petitioners have

collectively contended that there exist several significant differences

between the two groups of surveyors, consisting of registered surveyors in

one and the registered licensed surveyor in the other, in support of their

claim that the Council has acted ultra vires.

However, careful examination of the text of the Act also indicates

that, in addition to the said two groups of registered surveyors, a third

group of registered surveyors are recognised by the Legislature. This is

indicative from the provisions of the Act which recognised a specified

group of registered surveyors, who could be distinctly identified and

separated from the rest. This was achieved by attaching a description to

the nature of their engagement in land surveying to their title registered

surveyor. In terms of the Act, all registered surveyors may engage in the

act of land surveying. But in terms of certain Sections of the Act, the third

group of registered surveyors too are engaged in the act of land surveying,

but they are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government, as

employees of the Survey Department. The Act itself seek to carve out this

subgroup from the rest of the registered surveyors by making repeated

references to the said third group of registered surveyors, who are

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

38

engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government. These instances

shall be referred to once more in a more descriptive manner further down

in this judgment at an appropriate stage.

In contrast to the contention of the Petitioners the Respondents

claimed that the wording used by the Legislature in Section 44(1), amply

demonstrate that it reflects a unified body of all registered surveyors,

inclusive of the registered surveyors, who are in employment of the

Survey Department.

The conflicting contentions that were advanced by the parties before

us are primarily centred around the statutory provisions contained in

Sections 41(1) and 44(1) of the Act, demanding that this Court considers

them in relation to the dispute presented before the Court of Appeal.

Section 41(1) and its proviso reads as follows:

[E]very registered surveyor who is desirous of practising or

attempting or professing to practise land surveying, shall apply to

the Council for an annual practising licence.

Provided however, registered Surveyors in the Survey Department

engaging in land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor

General, shall not be required to obtain an annual practising licence

for the purpose of engaging in land surveying on behalf of the

Government.

Whereas Section 44(1) reads:

[A] registered surveyor

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

39

(a) may engage in land surveys in the service of the

Government and when authorised by the Surveyor

General; or

(b) who holds a Annual Practising License, may engage in

the practice of land surveying for fee or reward.

The proviso to Section 41(1) as well as Section 44 contain references

to registered surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying in the service

of the Government, while serving in the Survey Department. The said

proviso reads registered Surveyors in the Survey Department engaging in

land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor General, shall not be

required to obtain an annual practising licence for the purpose of engaging in land

surveying on behalf of the Government. According to Section 44 (1)(a) a

registered surveyor may engage in land surveys in the service of the

Government. This particular Section further expands the membership of

the registered surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying on behalf of

the Government by not restricting them only to such surveyors, but also

to the registered surveyors who are engaged in land surveying on behalf

of the Government, when authorised by the Surveyor General.

Upon perusal of the statutory provisions contained in the Act in its

entirety, it was revealed that there are several other Sections that contain

similar references to the registered surveyors, who are engaged in land

surveying on behalf of the Government. Section 45(1)(c)(i), whilst dealing

with professional misconduct of registered surveyors, states where such

surveyor being an officer in the service of the Government has conducted the

survey or certified the plan or map without exercising due care or caution is

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

40

guilty of professional misconduct. Similarly, in Section 54(b), in dealing

with the registered surveyors who failed to comply with the requirements

imposed in subsection 1 of that Section, states that a registered surveyor

who is in the service of the Government has not complied with the requirements

imposed under subsection (1) the Council may report such non-compliance to the

Surveyor General for appropriate action.

The instances in which a registered surveyor is guilty of committing

professional misconduct are set out in Section 45. This Section commences

with the words a registered surveyor shall be guilty of professional

misconduct, if he is found in any proceeding or appeal, to have been negligent

or failed to do any one or more of the specified acts as set out in the

subsections (a) to (f). The Section made these different instances of

professional misconduct that are specified therein applicable to all

registered surveyors, a factor supports the Respondents contention of

unified body of registered surveyors. Section 47 too supports that

proposition.

However, in dealing with an instance where a registered surveyor

alleged to have certified as to the accuracy of any survey or any plan or map

in relation to a survey, the Section introduced two sub paragraphs by

numbering them as (i) and (ii), where two different situations were

described and provided with different remedial action. Section 45(1)(c)(i)

deals with where such surveyor being an officer in the service of the

Government has conducted the survey or certified the plan or map without

exercising due care or caution, whereas Section 54(1)(c)(ii) deals with four

different situations ( as set out in paragraphs A to D) in which

where such surveyor being a registered licensed surveyor.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

41

In this instance, the Legislature has clearly recognised certain acts of

professional misconduct that could be committed only by a registered

surveyor, who is an officer in the service of the Government, leaving out the

rest of registered surveyors from the applicability of said sub-Section.

Section 54(1) is the Section by which the Council was conferred with

the power to impose a requirement on the registered surveyors to attend

specified courses, in order to gain specific experience, or take other

appropriate action within a specified period for the purpose of

maintaining and improving their knowledge and skills. Section 54(2)(a)

states a registered surveyor who has been issued with an annual practising

licence has not complied with any of the requirements the Council could resort

to any one or more of the actions as set out in Section 54(2)(a)(i) to (iii).

When such requirement not complied with by a registered surveyor who is

in the service of the Government, the Council could only report such non-

compliance to the Surveyor General, requesting for appropriate action.

In relation to this instance, what needed to be highlighted is that

Section 54, only deals with two groups of registered surveyors. The said

Section, while dealing with registered surveyors, who were issued with

Annual Practising Licences (for that reason, who are practicing in land

surveying), also dealt with the registered surveyors, who are engaged in

land surveying in the service of the Government, thus confirming once

more the existence of two groups of registered surveyors out of the three.

But Section 54 has left out the remaining group of registered surveyors (

who do not engage in land surveying on behalf of the Government) from

its applicability even though they too are engaged in land surveying. This

omission seems to suggest that the Legislature would not have envisaged a

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

42

situation where there would be registered surveyors, other than the ones

who are not engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government (the

pleadings indicate that there are over 700 such registered surveyors, who

are in employment under Survey General). If it in fact the case is, then it

too accrues to the benefit of the Petitioners, as it further supports the claim

advanced by them. Be that as it may, it must be noted here that this

instance too is consistent with the contention advanced by the Petitioners.

It is in this backdrop of legislative scheme; I now turn to consider

the statutory provisions contained in Sections 41(1) and 44 once more, but

in another perspective.

I shall proceed to consider Section 44(1) first, which reads as follows:

A registered surveyor

(a) may engage in land surveys in the service of the

Government and when authorised by the Surveyor

General; or

(b) who holds a Annual Practising Licence, may engage in

the practice of land surveying for fee or reward.

Plain reading of the said Section indicates that a surveyor, once

issued with a Certificate of Registration by the Council, has three options

to choose from if he wishes to pursue a career in land surveying. After

becoming a registered surveyor by obtaining a Certificate of Registration,

he could obtain an Annual Practising Licence and become a Registered

Licensed Surveyor and thereafter start to practice the profession of land

surveying for a fee or reward. He also has another option as he could also

engage in land surveying in the service of the Government by being a

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

43

public officer. Thirdly, he could obtain an authorisation by the Surveyor

General to engage in land survey under the latters supervision. The

distinction made by the statutory provisions, as I have already referred to

earlier on in this judgment between engage in land survey and practice of

land survey, is retained in this Section as well.

The Court of Appeal was inclined to accept the contention advanced

by the Respondents, and held in their favour on this point by stating that

the word or that occurs in between the two subsections (a) and (b) of

Section 54, should be taken as a conjunction to link or connect two of more

alternatives or possibilities, particularly in view of the fact that Sinhala

word used in the Act is ke;fyd;a, a word which could be translated into

English to mean otherwise, and the word otherwise, is a conjunction,

means if not or else. However, the Court of Appeal, at any point of

time, did not think it fit to consider these provisions in the light of the

phraseology used in the Act, engage in land survey and practice of land

survey.

In the context under consideration, it is relevant to mention here that

the Petitioners, in support of their contention made on the Section 44(1),

also relied on the statutory provisions contained in Section 10(2), where

the Act, repeats these identical wordings, indicative of clear recognition of

the two groups, when it states that a Cadastral survey could be conducted

by a registered surveyor in the Survey Department or by a registered

surveyor who possesses an Annual Practising Licence in terms of Section

41.

Section 10(2) reads as follows:

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

44

[A] cadastral survey for the purpose of the Registration of Title Act

shall be conducted by a registered surveyor

(a) who is in the Survey Department or:

(b) who possesses an Annual Practising Licence in terms

of Section 41,

and who has obtained a Certificate of Accreditation in terms

of section 11.

Examination of the Sinhala text reveals that the word used by the

Legislature in enacting Section 10(2), used the word fy` in the Sinhala text

instead of using the word ke;fyd;a, as it did in Section 54. The word fy` ,

which could be translated into English as or, denotes the very word used

in the English text of the Act, in relation to both these Sections.

The use of the word ke;fyd;a in the Sinhala text of the Act makes no

difference to the meaning of the Section 41(1). The English- Sinhalese-

Dictionary, compiled by Rev. Charles Carter in 1902, (2nd Ed), offers

Sinhalese language meaning to the English language word or denoting

ke;fyd;a. The contention advanced by the 5th Intervenient Respondent in

CA Writ Application No. 682/2011, stating that the word or could be

read either disjunctively or conjunctively, in view of a pronouncement

made in Stanton v Richardson (1875) 33 Law Times 193, was accepted by

the Court of Appeal, in arriving at the conclusion that the word ke;fyd;a

used in Section to denote a conjunction. The dictionary meaning of the

word ke;fyd;a contradicts that conclusion and when compared with the

similar provisions contained in Section 10, as it becomes clear that the said

word represents instances where it was also used in a disjunctive sense.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

45

Thus, it is clear that the scheme put in place by the Act did recognise the

two groups as distinct from each other, despite the apparent similarity of

the work they do, namely, land surveying.

In relation to the contention that had been placed before the Court of

Appeal over the two groups of registered surveyors, the Petitioners, in

addition to Section 44(1), also relied on its proviso. The Petitioners claim

that it is yet another instance where the Legislature retained the distinction

it made between these two groups, as in terms of that Section, the

registered surveyors who engaged in land surveying on behalf of the

Government are exempted from otherwise a mandatory requirement,

imposed on other registered surveyors by the Act, namely the necessity to

obtain an Annual Practising Licence, if they are to practice land surveying.

The Respondents, on the other hand, contend that Section 44 clearly

contemplates a situation in which a registered surveyor in the service of

Government, if issued with an Annual Practising Licence, too could

engage in the practice of land surveying for fee or reward, as the Circular

issued by the Surveyor General, merely outlines the conditions that are

attached to the granting of such permission.

Learned DSG, in his submissions made before the Court of Appeal

as well as this Court, contended that Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution

guarantees every citizen of the freedom to engage in any lawful

occupation and this right could be restricted only on the grounds laid

down in Article 17, and that too by in terms of law, meaning an

enactment of Parliament. In the absence of any statutory prohibition for a

registered surveyor, who engaged in land surveying on behalf of the

Government, to engage in private practice, after obtaining an Annual

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

46

Practising Licence from the Council, learned DSG argued that the

Petitioners are not entitled to the reliefs they prayed from the Court of

Appeal.

As already noted, Section 44(1)(b) empowers a registered surveyor,

who hold an Annual Practising Licence, to engage in the practice of land

surveying for fee or reward. Hence the imposition of several statutory

requirements, imposed by Section 41(1) on such a registered surveyor,

when compared with the ones related to a registered surveyor. If he is to

apply for an Annual Practising Licence under that subsection from the

Council and obtain one under Section 41(2), he must satisfy the Council

that he had followed the prescribed course of study and training approved

by it and have acquired knowledge and skill to practice land surveying.

Then the proviso states that registered Surveyors in the Survey

Department engaging in land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor

General, shall not be required to obtain an annual practising licence for the

purpose of engaging in land surveying on behalf of the Government.

The Respondents also rely on this proviso as the Petitioners did in

support of their contention, but by presenting a converse position. The

Respondents claim that the words registered Surveyors in the Survey

Department engaging in land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor

General, shall not be required to obtain an annual practising licence for the

purpose of engaging in land surveying on behalf of the Government, in itself

indicate that if they were to engage in the practice of land surveying, they

too are obligated by law to obtain an Annual Practising Licence. The Court

of Appeal was of the view that the concession given to the Government

Surveyors when engaging in land surveying on behalf of the Government cannot

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

47

be interpreted to mean that Land Survey Council is prohibited from issuing

Annual Practising Licence to Government Surveyors.

In dealing with this particular aspect of the provisions contained in

Section 41(1) and its proviso, I would rather take the main Section for

consideration first, before proceeding to deal with its proviso. The Section

made it mandatory for every registered surveyor, who is desirous of

practicing or attempting or professing to practice land surveying, to apply

to the Council for an Annual Practising Licence. In this Section, the

emphasis given by the Legislature to the act of practice land surveying

preceded by insertion of the words practicing or attempting or professing

to could not be ignored. In interpreting the Section, these words should

be given due weightage deserve to them.

The practice of land surveying, unlike its counterpart engaging in

land surveying, comes with more responsibilities attached to it. A

registered surveyor, who was issued with an Annual Practising Licence, is

termed as registered licensed surveyor, and his name should appear in the

Register of such surveyors. Section 45 describes certain acts that are

specified therein as acts of professional misconduct that could be

committed only by a Registered Licensed Surveyor. The said Section

refers to four of such acts. With regard to registered surveyors, who are in

the service of the Government, and for that reason, are engaged in land

surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor General, there is only one

such act that is specified in the Section. With these observations, I turn

now to consider the proviso to Section 41(1).

It is the contention of the Respondents that the proviso of Section

41(1) recognises the entitlement of the registered surveyors, who are

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

48

engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government to be issued with

Annual Practising Licences and thereby enabling them to do private

practice, as that Section specifically stated that they are excluded from the

said requirement of obtaining such licences for the purpose of engaging in

land surveying on behalf of the Government. I am not fully convinced of

the legal validity of this contention.

The wording used in the proviso is clear. It states that, in order to

come within the exception recognised by it, a registered surveyor must

satisfy several requirements. He must engage in land surveying in the

Survey Department and that too on behalf of the Government. Such a

surveyor also must come under the supervision of the Surveyor General .

The Respondents, in presenting the said contention, seemed to have placed

no significance to the important operative words in that statutory

provision, namely engage in land surveying, whereas Section 41(1) speaks

of practising or attempting or professing to practise land surveying and not

engage in land surveying.

Bindra, in his work Interpretation of Statues, (9th Ed), while dealing

with the topic Proviso states (at p.111) that [T]he duty of the Court also

must be to give to the proviso, as far as possible, a meaning so restricted as to

bring it within the ambit and purview of the Section itself. If a proviso is capable of

a wide and a narrow connotation, and the narrower connotation brings it within

the purview of the Section, then the Court must prefer the narrower connotation

rather than the wider connotation of the two possible interpretations; the Court

should prefer that one which brings it within the purview of the Section. The

Court is not justified in construing a proviso as enlarging the scope of the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

49

enactment when it can fairly and properly be construed without attributing it that

effect.

The said proviso does not extend the exception it created for the

registered surveyors to be in the practice of land surveying, in addition to

their engagement of land surveying, as the Respondents contend. That

exception is limited only to an engagement in land surveying and clearly

not to recognise an entitlement to practice in land surveying for a fee or

reward . Therefore, I am of the considered view that the contention of the

Respondent on the proviso to Section 41(1) is not tenable. The proviso, in

effect, is a re-statement of what Section 44(1)(a) already provides for.

Section 44(1)(a) empowers a registered surveyor to engage in land survey

in the service of the Government and as per Section 44(1)(b), should hold

an Annual Practising Licence if he is to engage in the practice of land

surveying for fee or reward. Thus, when viewed in this perspective, the

proviso seemed a superfluous statement of law. But then there is a

principle of interpretation of statues to the effect that the Legislature does

not waste its words. Bindra, (supra) states (at p. 195) that [A]n Act should

be construed as to avoid redundancy or surplusage. It is no doubt true that as a

general rule Legislatures may be presumed not to make a superfluous provision.

But this presumption is not a strong presumption, and it is not uncommon to find

the Legislature inserting superfluous provision under the influence of what may

be abundant caution.

In my view, the Legislature opted to insert the proviso under Section

41(1) in this instance, for a very valid reason. That reason is directly

attributable to Sections 2(q) and 10(2)(b) of the Act. Section 2 specifies the

powers and functions of the Surveyor General. Section 2(q) states that he is

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

50

to ensure the maintenance of high professional standards among persons

engaged in land survey activities in the Survey Department. The words

persons and land surveying activities in the Survey Department are, in this

context, was inserted deliberately into the text by the Parliament for a

purpose it had in its mind.

Instead of using the term registered surveyor, the said Section uses

persons encompassing a wider spectrum of individuals. Similarly,

instead of using land surveying, the Section uses land surveying activities

in the Survey Department. With the insertion of these words, the

Legislature intended once more to denote a wider range of activities

which meant to be covered by that Section, of course, inclusive of the

activity of land surveying.

In addition, Section 10 also intended to provide for a similar

situation. Section 10(2) states that:

[A] cadastral survey for the purpose of the Registration of Title

Act shall be conducted by, a registered surveyor

(a) who is in the Survey Department or:

(b) who possesses an Annual Practising Licence in terms

of section 41, and who has obtained a Certificate of

Accreditation in terms of section 11.

In terms of Section 2(e), the Surveyor General is conferred with

power to establish and administer a system of accreditation for registered

surveyors seeking to conduct surveys under the Registration of Title Act, No. 21

of 1998 and to maintain a register of the Surveyors issued with Certificates of

Accreditation. Hence, under Section 10(2)(b), Surveyor General could

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

51

permit a registered licensed surveyor to conduct a cadastral survey for the

purpose of Registration of Title Act after granting him a Certificate of

Accreditation, in addition to have such a survey conducted by a registered

surveyor, who is in the Survey Department. Since such a registered

licensed surveyor conducts a cadastral survey on behalf of the

Government, in terms of Section 2(g), which sets out the powers and

functions of the Surveyor General, he is empowered to receive, approve and

maintain, cadastral surveying records so as to facilitate the production of cadastral

survey plans and maps and to serve as a comprehensive base for integration of

land information and also to establish and administer a system of accreditation

for registered surveyors seeking to conduct surveys under the Registration of Title

Act, No. 21 of 1998 and to maintain a register of the Surveyors issued with

Certificates of Accreditation, in terms of Section 2(e).

When a registered surveyor, who was issued with an Annual

Practising Licence by the Council, conducts a Cadastral survey, he is in fact

practicing land surveying for a fee or reward, but is caught up within the

term persons engaged in land survey activities in the Survey Department,

including those who may not hold any Annual Practising Licence. This

results in a position where a registered licensed surveyor, is practicing in

land surveying on behalf of the Government, not for a salary but for a fee or

reward. In my view, the insertion of the proviso to Section 41(1) was

made, perhaps to avoid any doubts that might arise, in view of certain

practical issues that might crop up, in the implementation of the

provisions contained in Sections 10(2)(b).

Another factor relied on by the Petitioners in support of their

contention was the existence of two registers, one for the Registered

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

52

Surveyors and another for Registered Licensed Surveyors. Only a passing

reference to this contention at this early stage of the judgment, but I intend

to undertake a fuller consideration of this aspect further down.

It seemed that the Court of Appeal, in rejecting the said contention

of the Petitioners, opted to take a restricted view to the purpose for which

two registers are maintained. However, Section 42(1), whilst imposing a

duty on the Council to maintain a register of all registered surveyors as

well as of the registered licensed surveyors, it further imposes a duty on

the Council to have these registers open for public inspection for a fee

and also supply a certified copy of any entry to such a person, upon

payment of the prescribed fee. The Act, in addition to these two registers,

also contains specific provisions for the maintenance of another register.

Section 2(e) of the Act confers power on the Surveyor General to

maintain a register of the Surveyors issued with Certificates of Accreditation.

Hence, in view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs, I

am inclined to agree with the contention of the Petitioners that the

maintenance of separate registers for registered surveyors and registered

licensed surveyors, depending upon their respective classifications in view

of the work they are engaged with, tends to support that they were treated

as surveyors who belong to two different groups.

Two sub-groups of Registered Surveyors

In view of the analysis contained in the preceding section of this

judgment on several statutory provisions contained in the Act, a clear

recognition of the two groups of registered surveyors could be identified

as contended by the Petitioners. The distinction recognised by the Act

between registered surveyors and registered licensed surveyors is further

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

53

consolidated by the merger of the two streams, which define the manner in

which both these categories of surveyors conduct their survey activities.

The registered surveyors are engaging in land surveying while the

registered licensed surveyors are practicing in land surveying and that too

for a fee or reward.

However, as already noted, the entire membership of the group of

registered surveyors could be further bisected to form two subgroups from

the terminology used in the text of the Act . The term subgroup is used

here quite arbitrarily, but with the intention to avoid any confusion that

might arise, in view of the already identified two groups of registered

surveyors.

These two subgroups could be described as the registered surveyors,

who are engaged in land surveying and, the registered surveyors, who are

engaged land surveying on behalf of the Government. The second

subgroup of registered surveyors are always referred to in the text of the

Act, coupled with a tag line, which made them identified either with the

Government or with the Survey Department. Following instances could be

cited as examples of this particular feature, where the Act made specific

reference to such registered surveyors:

i. a registered surveyor who is in the Survey Department

(Section 10(2)(a),

ii. a registered surveyor in the Survey Department engaging

in land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor

General and engaging in land surveying on behalf of the

Government (proviso to Section 41(1)),

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

54

iii. a registered surveyor engage in land surveys in the

service of Government, (Section 44(1)(a)),

iv. a registered surveyors being an officer in the service of the

Government (Section 45(c)(i)), and

v. a registered surveyors in the service of Government

(Section 54(2)(b).

However, in recognising an exception to the rule contained in

Section 41(1), the Legislature omitted to mention that a registered

surveyor, who is in employment of the Survey Department and engaged

in land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor General, shall

also be required to obtain an Annual Practising Licence, if he is desirous of

practicing or attempting or professing to practise land surveying in terms

of Section 41(1), but instead had opted to word the proviso to read that

such a surveyor, shall not be required to obtain an annual practising licence for

the purpose of engaging in land surveying on behalf of the Government

(emphasis added).

Returning to the Section by which the Council was conferred with

power to issue an Annual Practising Licence to a registered surveyor, the

wording used in the construction of the Section 41 must be carefully

examined. Section 41(1) reads thus, [E]very registered surveyor who is

desirous of practising or attempting or professing to practise land surveying, shall

apply to the Council for an annual practising licence.

It is correct to say that the said subsection speaks of every registered

surveyor in its text. But it also important to note that these words are

connected to the remaining part of the same sentence which reads who

is desirous of practising or attempting or professing to practise land surveying.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

55

This Section admittedly does not make any reference either directly or

indirectly to registered surveyors, who are employed in the Survey

Department. The over emphasis placed in that subsection to the word

practice (as opposed to mere engage in land surveying) with the insertion

of a series of words practising or attempting or professing to practise land

surveying is, in my view, applies to registered surveyors, who are not

employed elsewhere on a salaried employment, but are only desirous of

practising or attempting or professing to practise land surveying on full time

basis.

I find it relevant in this context to quote from Bindra (supra), who

states (at p.196), that [I]t is a well settled principle of construction that words

in a Statute are designedly used, and an interpretation must be avoided, which

would render the provisions either nugatory or part thereof otiose. No part of the

Statute can be just ignored by saying that the Legislature enacted the same not

knowing what it was saying. We must assume that the Legislature deliberately

used that expression, and it intended to convey some meaning thereby. It is not to

be assumed that the Legislature has used words meaning nothing.

Section 41(2), reads as follows:

[T]he Council may on application received in that behalf by a

registered surveyor accompanied by the prescribed fee, issue to such

surveyor an Annual Practising Licence where the Council is

satisfied that he has followed the prescribed courses of study and

training approved by the Council and acquired knowledge and skill

to practise land surveying.

It necessarily follows that when the Council receives an application

by a registered surveyor applying for an Annual Practising Licence, he

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

56

should be desirous of engage in land surveying by practising or attempting

or professing to practise land surveying. The Council is then empowered to

issue an Annual Practising Licence to such a registered surveyor, if it is

satisfied that he has followed the prescribed courses of study and training

approved by the Council and acquired knowledge and skill to practise

land surveying.

The conspicuous absence of any mention of the registered surveyors,

who engage in land surveying on behalf of the Government, either in

subsections (1) or (2) of Section 41 (except in the proviso) is of relevance as,

already indicated, the Legislature has consistently maintained the identity

of these three groups of surveyors, throughout the entire text of the Act.

Even in the proviso, where a reference was made to a registered surveyor,

the exception is limited to enable them only to engage in land surveying on

behalf of the Government, without an Annual Practising Licence.

The definition provided to the term the Surveyor General in Section

66 also consistent with the said scheme laid down by the Act. The

definition states that the Surveyor General is a registered surveyor, who is

the head of the Survey Department. If the contention of the Respondents on

this point is accepted as reflecting the correct presentation of the

Legislative scheme formulated by the Act, it would create an absurdity

since there is nothing to prevent the Surveyor General from applying for

an Annual Practising Licence for himself from the Council, the very

institution he presides over in his capacity as the Surveyor General, to

engage in private practice. The words registered surveyor contained in

the said definition therefore assumes greater significance in this context.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

57

Reliance placed by the learned DSG, during his submissions, to

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution, adds another dimension to the

contention presented by the other Respondents.

It was his contention that if a person can generate an income by

engaging in a lawful profession or a vocation, the same could be

prohibited only by an express enactment. Therefore, it was his submission

that since the Act had comprehensively dealt with the practice of land

surveying in Sri Lanka, rather than prohibiting, it appears to have

permitted the registered surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying on

behalf of the Government, to engage in private practice. Learned DSGs

submission is clearly based on the rights-based approach adopted by the

Courts in interpreting legislation and in the instances where an exercise of

administrative discretion is involved for them to be in conformity with the

Fundamental rights.

Prof. Craig, in his book Administrative Law (5th Ed., at p.21)

recommends the creation of strong judicial presumption that legislation is

not intended to interfere with these rights, combined with a more intensive,

searching scrutiny which demands greater justification of the discretionary

decisions impinging upon such important interests.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 11th Respondent (in SC

Appeal No. 85/2021), made a reference to a judgment of this Court in

Madurapperuma v Attorney General (SC (FR) Appln. No. 90/79 decided

on 05.02.1980), where almost an identical contention was placed for

consideration by a petitioner who, being a public officer, by alleging

infringement of his fundamental rights. The contention placed before this

Court by the petitioner in that instance was, that he, being a Government

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

58

servant, is a citizen who enjoys the fundamental rights guaranteed to him

under Article 14 in all its amplitude, subject only to the restrictions, if any,

as may be prescribed by law in terms of Articles 15 and 16. Therefore, in

the absence of such limitations, the Cabinet of Ministers could not, in terms

of Article 55(4) of the Constitution, seek to restrict the scope of such rights

by the provisions of the Establishments Code.

Sharvananda J (as he then was) was not impressed with that

contention and stated that when a citizen becomes a Public officer, he

enters into employment-relationship with the State which subjects him to duties

and obligations. Power is vested in the Cabinet of Ministers by Article 55(4) of the

Constitution to prescribe and define such duties and obligations. Such

prescription inevitably infringes on the citizens fundamental rights and

constricts their exercise Article 55(4) concerns a citizen in his character as a

Public officer. However, after the 17th amendment to the Constitution, and

in terms of Article 55(3), subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of

public officers shall be vested in the Public Service Commission, except for

the Heads of Department.

His Lordship then added that such an employee has no

fundamental right to employment under the State, nor is he obliged to accept

service under the State. If he does not choose to accept the modification of his

fundamental freedoms which State service involves, he at liberty to retain his

freedoms and give up his work. In such an event, the State has not deprived him

of any of his freedoms.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner in SC Appeal No.

85/2011 too referred to a judgment ( Dr YP Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

59

AIR (1982) 439, which was pronounced after two years from the judgment

of Madurapperuma v Attorney General (supra), but adopting an almost

identical approach in determining against the entitlement of a

Government doctor, to engage in private practice, whilst being

employed as a Government employee. The Court held, [O]nce he joins the

Government service, he shall be subject to all terms and conditions of employment

and rules and regulations governing the employment.

The resultant position is, that a registered surveyor who is engaged

in land surveying on behalf of the Government, by being an employee of

the Survey Department, could not be considered only in his capacity as a

registered surveyor, but in addition to being conferred with that title on

him, he ought to be considered as a registered surveyor, who is in

employment of the Survey Department as a public officer and engaged in

land surveying under the supervision of the Surveyor General on behalf of

the Government. With the adoption of this view, a concomitant issue that

arise for consideration is whether this subgrouping of registered

surveyors, who are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the

Government, is contrary to Article 12(1).

In Palihawadana v Attorney General (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 65, it was

observed that [T]he principle underlying the guarantee in Article 12 is not that

the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, or that the same remedies should be made available

to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons

similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in respect of privileges

conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the

same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

60

another if, as regards the subject matter of the legislation or administration, their

position is substantially the same. As there is no infringement of the equal

protection rule, if the law deals alike with all members of a certain class, the State

has the undoubted right of classifying persons and placing those who are

substantially similar under the same Rule of Law, while applying different rules to

persons differently situated. The classification must not be arbitrary but should be

based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable

relation to the object sought to be attained.

A similar approach was adopted by Sripavan J (as he then was) in

Senadeera and Others v Commissioner General of Labour (2013) 1 Sri L.R.

60 by reiterating (at p. 65) that the right to equality means that among

equals, the law should be equal and should be equally administered, thereby the

like should be treated alike. In this particular matter, the issue before this

Court was whether the candidates selected through an Open Competitive

Examination were similarly circumstanced as that of the candidates who

are selected based on a Limited Competitive Examination. His Lordship, in

the light of the principle enunciated in Ramupillai v Festus Perera,

Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils & Home Affairs

(1991) 1 Sri L.R. 11, by Ranasinghe CJ that once such selections are made

those taken in from such sources are integrated into one common class: that

thereafter such appointees are "clubbed" together into a common stream of service

and cannot thereafter be treated differently for purposes of promotion

proceeded to hold that (at p. 67) [S]tate is free to decide the sources from

which recruitments to the Public Service are to be made. The sources could be

recruitment based on Open Competitive Examination as well as the Limited

Competitive Examination. Once selections are made, they cannot thereafter be

treated differently for purposes of their future promotions; that their genetic

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

61

blemishes disappear once they are integrated into a common class known as

Labour Officer, Grade II.

In relation to the three appeals pending before this Court, it must be

observed that with the acquisition of the status registered surveyors after

obtaining registration with the Council in terms of Sections 37(b) and

39(1), the qualified surveyors, depending on whether they engage in land

surveying or practice land surveying, are clearly divided into two groups.

Then there was a further subdivision of the registered surveyors,

depending on whether they engage in land surveying or whether they

engage in land surveying on behalf of the Government.

However, when such a registered surveyor has decided to join the

Survey Department to engage in land surveying on behalf of the

Government under the supervision of Surveyor General, for the purpose of

37(c) of the Act, such a surveyor could not be clubbed together as a

registered surveyor along with the other group of registered surveyors,

who have decided not to take up employment under the Government. In

such circumstances, such a surveyor ought to be considered not only as a

registered surveyor, but a registered surveyor, who is engaged in land

surveying on behalf of the Government and therefore placed under the

supervision of the Surveyor General. This is because such a registered

surveyor, is not only placed under the disciplinary control of the Council,

but being a public officer, is also placed under the provisions of the

Establishments Code, in addition to the supervision of the Surveyor

General, in terms of Section 2(q), which confers authority on him to ensure

the maintenance of high professional standards in such a surveyors

activities in land surveying in the Survey Department.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

62

It is therefore clear that, after obtaining registration with the Council

and having acquired the legally recognised status of a registered surveyor,

such a surveyor could, depending on his personal inclination, could opt

either to engage in land surveying, or practice land surveying for fee or

reward. If a registered surveyor, opts to engage in land surveying, then he

has two options to choose from. He could either engage in land surveying on

behalf of the Government, under the supervision of the Surveyor General or

could simply engage in land surveying. This engagement in land surveying

could be after obtaining employment in any other institution where land

surveying is required. But being a registered surveyor only, he is

prohibited from practising in land surveying for a fee or reward, in terms

of Section 44(1)(b). When a registered surveyor accepts employment under

some entity, be it a public or private, then his engagement in land

surveying may also be subscribed by the conditions that are stipulated in

his Letter of Appointment, in addition to the other statutorily laid down

conditions.

The said re-grouping of the registered surveyors into these three

distinct groups, as evident from the examination of the scheme formulated

by the Act itself, depending on the manner in which they wish to employ

themselves in their chosen field of expertise, could be termed as a

classification not only based on an intelligible differentia and sanctioned

by law but also a classification that satisfies the two tests applied by

Ranasinghe CJ in Ramuppillai v Festus Perera, Minister of Public

Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and Others (1991)

1 Sri L.R. 11.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

63

Mark Fernando J in Liyanapathirana and another v Peoples Bank

and Others (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 358 held (at p. 361) [D]ifferentiation by reference

to the classes to which they belonged, and service therein, was neither irrational

nor unintelligible. This was an instance where, among the employees who

were similarly placed initially, 29 of them were subsequently promoted by

applying the ethnic ratio, in terms of Public Administration Circular No.

15/90 issued on 9.3.1990. The petitioners did not challenge the said set of

promotions. Thereafter Circular No. 4005191 dated 5.9.91 was issued

calling for applications for promotion to Grade 111, Class 2 from officers

who had completed one year of service after confirmation in Grade III,

Class 3. While the said 29 employees, who had been promoted on the

ethnic ratio could have satisfied this condition, the petitioners were not

qualified. Therefore, the Court concluded that the petitioners had ceased to

be in the same class as the 29 promoted employees.

This process of reasoning adopted by Fernando J applies to the

instant appeals with equal force. The registered surveyors, when they have

taken up appointment in the Survey Department to engage in land

surveying on behalf of the Government, they have differentiated

themselves from the rest of the registered surveyors who opted not to.

Therefore, when the registered surveyors, who are already employed in

the Survey Department, applied for Annual Practising Licences to practice

land surveying for a fee or reward, they could not be treated similarly to

registered surveyor, who opted not to take up such employment, as these

two groups are not of similar status, in relation to their eligibility for the

issuance of Annual Practising Licences. Hence, there is no infringement of

equality principles.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

64

In arriving at the finding to the question, whether the Council acted

ultra vires in granting permission to registered surveyors, who engage in

land surveying on behalf of the Government and under the supervision of

Surveyor General, it becomes imperative that the statutory provisions

contained in Section 37 and 41(2) are also examined in detail.

It is clear that the Council had its functions and duties specifically

spelt out under Section 37, in addition to the powers conferred on it by

Section 38. Section 37 (c) imposes a duty on the Council not only to receive

applications from registered surveyors for the issue of Annual Practising

Licences but also to issue such licences to such surveyors where the Council

is satisfied that such surveyors possess the knowledge and skill to practice the

profession of land surveying if the applicable criterion are satisfied by such

an applicant.

Section 41(1) imposes a requirement on a registered surveyor, who

is desirous of practising or attempting or professing to practise land surveying,

shall apply to the Council for an annual practising licence.

Then Section 41(2) states [T]he Council may on application received in

that behalf by a registered surveyor accompanied by the prescribed fee, issue to

such surveyor an annual practising licence where the Council is satisfied that he

has followed the prescribed courses of study and training approved by the Council

and acquired knowledge and skill to practise land surveying.

It is not necessary to specifically highlight the common denominator

in all these Sections. What the Legislature had in its mind in enacting the

said provision seems to be to provide for the manner in which a registered

surveyor is recognised as a one, who is desirous of practising or attempting or

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

65

professing to practise land surveying. Section 41(4) confers a title on such a

registered surveyor as a registered licensed surveyor.

None of the Sections referred to in the preceding paragraphs made

any specific reference to a registered surveyor, who is engaged in land

surveying on behalf of the Government and under the supervision of the

Surveyor General, could also apply for an Annual Practising Licence to

practise land surveying for a fee or reward and the Council could grant a

licence to such an applicant. This is the premise on which the Petitioners

have founded their challenge on validity of the decision of the Council. On

the other hand, the Respondents, who resists the Petitioners claim, rely on

the fact that there is no express prohibition either for the Council to desist

itself from granting such licences as the Sections merely referred to every

registered surveyor without any qualification.

Clearly, Section 41(1) could be taken as the gateway through which

each of the registered surveyors must pass through, in order to earn the

title registered licensed surveyor from the Council. The placement of the

proviso in Section 41(1), instead under any other Section of the Act,

supports the view that Section 44(1) statutorily demarcates the boundaries

within which each of the two groups should engage in their chosen field of

expertise. If a registered surveyor, who wish only to engage in land

surveying on behalf of the Government, he need not trouble himself with

the process set out in Sections 41(1) and (2). Hence the words [E]very

registered surveyor that contains in Section 41(1) is pivotal to the

determination of the instant appeals.

In view of these statutory provisions, the question that arise for

determination is whether the words every registered surveyor in Section

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

66

41(1) should mean to include the registered surveyors, who are engaged in

land surveying on behalf of the Government and under the supervision of

the Surveyor General, for granting of Annual Practising Licences?

If that Section is taken for consideration in total isolation from the

rest of the provisions that are contained in the Act, the obvious answer to

that question is a one in the affirmative. But the adoption of such an

approach, in the determination of the said question, would not be in

conformity with the accepted rules of interpretation of statutes.

Maxwell, in his work on this area of law ( Maxwell on The

Interpretation of Statues, 12th Ed.,), describes the Literal Rule of

Interpretation of Statutes as follows (at p. 28): [I]f there is nothing to

modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains, it must be

construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The

safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take

the words themselves and arrive, if possible, at their meaning without, in the first

instance, reference to cases.

Section 41(1) and 41(2), taken in isolation from the rest of the

provisions contained in the Act and taken in its literal meaning, of course

does not recognise any distinction between the registered surveyors

engaged in land surveying and registered surveyors, who engaged in land

surveying on behalf of the Government under the supervision of the

Surveyor General. However, as Maxwell added a qualification to the

application of the Literal Rule by stating [I]f there is nothing to modify, alter

or qualify the language which the statute contains and in such a situation that

Statute must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and

sentences. I find that the issue to be determined by this Court with regard

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

67

to the provisions that are applicable in this context, qualifies to be taken as

an instance where the first part of that statement of Maxwell, which states

if there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute

contains applies.

The judgment of the House of Lords in the matter of R v S of S for

Health ex parte Quintavalle (on behalf of Pro-Life Alliance) [2003] 2 WLR

692, cited by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners in SC

Appeal No. 86/2021, is helpful in this regard as it provides persuasive

insight into the issue at hand. In that instance the issue presented before

the House of Lords was whether live human embryos, created by cell

nuclear replacement (CNR), falls outside the regulatory scope of the

Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and whether licensing the

creation of such embryos is prohibited by section 3(3)(d) of that Act. That

issue is similar to the one that has arisen in the instant appeals for

determination, as here too the contentious issue is, in the absence of a

specific provision that enabled the Council to grant Annual Practising

Licence to a registered surveyor, who is engaged in land survey on behalf

of the Government and under the supervision of the Surveyor General, in

terms of Section 41(2). In both these situations, there is no express

statutory provision by which such permission could be granted or

imposed a clear and unambiguous prohibition.

Lord Bingham described the resultant situation as follows:

Such is the skill of parliamentary draftsmen that most statutory

enactments are expressed in language which is clear and

unambiguous and gives rise to no serious controversy. But these are

not the provisions which reach the Courts, or at any rate the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

68

appellate Courts. Where parties expend substantial resources

arguing about the effect of a statutory provision it is usually because

the provision is, or is said to be, capable of bearing two or more

different meanings, or to be of doubtful application to the particular

case which has now arisen, perhaps because the statutory language

is said to be inapt to apply to it, sometimes because the situation

which has arisen is one which the draftsman could not have foreseen

and for which he has accordingly made no express provision.

In my view, the issue that this Court is now grappling with could be

aptly described as a situation which has arisen is one which the draftsman

could not have foreseen and for which he has accordingly made no express

provision as Lord Bingham has termed it. I have already concluded that the

underlying policy on which the Survey Act was drafted and then enacted

into law by the Parliament had no such intention and therefore such an

eventuality could not have been foreseen by it and that provides an

explanation as to why there is no express provision.

Owing to the clear classification adopted by the Legislature in

recognising the different groups of registered surveyors, depending on the

manner how they survey land, the literal rule of interpretation of statutes

could not be applied to the two Sections for such a course of action would

lead to create several inconsistencies with the other provisions contained

in the Act. In order to overcome such a situation Maxwell (ibid) refers to a

presumption against intending what is inconvenient or unreasonable in

determining the Legislative intent. Learned author states (at p. 199) [I]n

determining either the general object of the Legislature, or the meaning of its

language in any particular passage, it is obvious that the intention which appears

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

69

to be most in accord with convenience, reason, justice, and legal principles should,

in all cases of doubtful significance, be presumed to be the rue one.

In this regard, he further stated (at age 208) that [I]f the Court is to

avoid a statutory result that flouts common sense and justice it must do so not be

disregarding the statute or overriding it, but by interpreting it in accordance with

the judicially presumed Parliamentary concern for common sense and justice. But

the possibility of injustice which leads the Court to adopt a particular construction

must be real one: if the injustices suggested in arguments are purely hypothetical,

and may never or only rarely occur in practice, the Court will remain unmoved.

It is most appropriate to cite Lord Bingham from R v S of S for

Health ex parte Quintavalle (supra) once more in relation to the suitability

of the application of the literal rule in such circumstances. His Lordship

states that:

[T]he basic task of the Court is to ascertain and give effect to the

true meaning of what Parliament has said in the enactment to be

construed. But that is not to say that attention should be confined,

and a literal interpretation given to the particular provisions which

give rise to difficulty. Such an approach not only encourages

immense prolixity in drafting, since the draftsman will feel obliged

to provide expressly for every contingency which may possibly arise.

It may also (under the banner of loyalty to the will of Parliament)

lead to the frustration of that will, because undue concentration on

the minutiae of the enactment may lead the Court to neglect the

purpose which Parliament intended to achieve when it enacted the

statute. Every statute other than a pure consolidating statute is,

after all, enacted to make some change, or address some problem, or

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

70

remove some blemish, or effect some improvement in the national

life. The Court's task, within the permissible bounds of

interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament's purpose. So, the

controversial provisions should be read in the context of the statute

as a whole, and the statute as a whole should be read in the historical

context of the situation which led to its enactment.

Certainly, in the light of the applicable principles and in fulfilling

the task of providing an interpretation to the relevant statutory provisions,

I am of the view that the contentions that were advanced by the Petitioners

before this Court as well as the Court below, and are already referred

earlier on in this judgment, could not be summarily rejected by equating

them to an instance where the injustices suggested in arguments are purely

hypothetical, and may never or only rarely occur in practice, for this Court to

remain unmoved, as Maxwell states.

The principle of law that the prohibition must be expressly provided

Upon perusal of the judgment of the Court of Appeal it is revealed

that, in arriving at its conclusion that the complaint presented before that

Court by the Petitioners to have the circular struck down on the basis of

ultra vires has no valid legal basis, that Court has acted on the principle

that in the absence of an express prohibition imposed by the Act on the

Council, due to which it was prevented from granting Annual Practising

Licences to registered Surveyors, who are serving in the Surveyor

Department, such a licence could legally be issued. The Court states in this

context that [I]f the legislature intended not to issue Annual Practising

Licences for the Government Surveyors to engage in private practice, then it

should have been expressly stated in the Act, and not vice versa. Nowhere in the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

71

Act does not say that a Government Surveyor is prohibited from obtaining an

Annual Practising Licence. It is well accepted principle that prohibitions cannot

be presumed (emphasis original).

The Court of Appeal, thereupon, inserted a quotation from the

judgment of Hevavitharana v Themis de Silva (1961) 63 NLR 68, in

support of the approach it had taken in determining the Petitioners

applications. That was an instance where Tambiah J stated (at p. 72) that the

[C]ourts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as

prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse

principle that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to

be prohibited by the law. As a matter of general principle prohibition cannot be

presumed.

In the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal, it was held that

issuance of the Field Staff Circular No. 05/2011 by the Surveyor General is

not ultra vires of his powers. In arriving at this conclusion, that Court

considered the contention that the dichotomy that claims to exist between

the registered surveyors and registered licensed surveyors had no valid basis.

Thereupon, the Court, in holding that the said issuance of the impugned

circular was intra vires, primarily acted on the premise that [I]t is well

accepted principle that prohibitions cannot be presumed.

With due respect to the line of reasoning adopted by the Court

below, I am not so convinced of its legal validity, particularly in the

utilisation of the principle that had been laid down by Hevavitharana v

Themis de Silva (supra) in an instance where the Petitioners sought a Writ

of Certiorari, seeking to quash a circular, the issuance of which is an act

allegedly in ultra vires. Clearly, the issue before the Court was not of an

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

72

instance where a lacuna was discovered in the procedural aspect in

granting of Annual Practising Licences, but of vires of the authority, which

granted the impugned licences.

The issue presented by Hevavitharana v Themis de Silva (supra)

before the then Supreme Court was whether a trial Court could exclude a

separate land, wrongly included by a plaintiff, as being part of the corpus

of a partition case. In delivering the judgment, Tambiah J, stated (at p. 71)

that it is not the intention of the legislature in passing the Partition Act that

the Court should partition any lands other than those that came within the ambit

of section 2 of the Act and proceeded to reject the contention that Section 26

of the Partition Act makes no provision for excluding from a partition

action, any part of the land to which the action relates. The Court held that

the said Section does not exhaust all the orders which a Court could make, in

our view the Court has the inherent power, under section 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code, to make an order excluding a lot which has been wrongly

included in the corpus. It is in this context, his Lordship found it apposite to

reproduce the pronouncement made by Mahmood, J., in Narsingh Das v.

Mangal Dubey (1883) 5 Allahabad 163, (at p. 172) to the effect that the

[C]ourts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as

prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse

principle that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to

be prohibited by the law. As a matter of general principle prohibitions cannot be

presumed.

It is clear from the text, that this pronouncement was made by

Mahmood, J., in relation to an interpretation that should be given to a

provision contained in the Civil Procedure Code of India. The judgment of

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

73

Hevavitharana v Themis de Silva (supra) too dealt with a situation in

which an interpretation of a procedural law provision was involved. The

judgments that I came across of having acted on the principle referred to in

Hevavitharana v Themis de Silva are indicative of the fact that the

superior Courts have acted on that principle only when they were

confronted with the task of determining some aspect of a statutory

provision laying down a procedure, either in the Civil Procedure Code or

of the Partition Law, which necessitated a judicial interpretation. The

judgments of Dionis v William Singho and Others (1973) 77 NLR 103,

Seneveratne v Abeykoon (1986) 2 Sri L.R. 1, Ratnasingham v Dissanike

and Others (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 8, Martin Silva and Another v Central

Engineering Consultancy Bureau and Another (2003) 2 Sri L.R. 228 and

Aryaratne v Laksiri Fernando (2004) 1 Sri L.R. 184, are some of these

instances.

However, even in relation to the task of interpretation of procedural

laws, this principle could not be taken as a one which has universal

application. The judgment of Ratnasingham v Dasanaike and Others

(1998) 1 Sri L.R. 8, indicates that when the petitioner of that application

relied on the principle that every procedure is to be taken as prohibited unless

it is expressly provided for by the Code (per Hevavitharana v Themis de

Silva) in support of his contention that the District Court had jurisdiction

to grant probate of a last will which dealt exclusively with movable

property abroad, Mark Fernando J was of the view that simply because

there is no such provision, to adopt the interpretation for which the petitioner

contends, would be to do what the House of Lords condemned in Magor & St.

Mellons RDC v. Newport Corp (1951) 2 All ER 839, (at p. 841) what the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

74

legislature has not written, the Court must write. This proposition cannot be

supported. It appears to me a naked usurpation of the legislative function under

the thin guise of interpretation, and it is less justifiable when it is guesswork with

what material the legislature would, if it had discovered the gap, have filled it in. If

a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act".

I am therefore fortified in my view that the principle that enunciated

by Mahmood, J., in Narsingh Das v. Mangal Dubey (1883) that every

procedure is to be understood as permissible until it is shown to be

prohibited by law, is relevant where an issue concerning an interpretation

that should be given to a statutory provision laying down a procedural

aspect and not to an instance where the Court was called upon the

determine the vires of an act of a body, created by a Statute. In this regard, I

think it is important to reproduce the pronouncement of Mahmood, J., as

referred to above once more, but inclusive of few more sentences that

precedes and follows the often-quoted section of that judgment, which

would clearly illustrate the point.

His Lordship stated thus:

according to my view of the rules of construction applicable to

statues like the Civil Procedure Code, the Courts are not to act upon

the principle that every procedure is to be taken as prohibited unless

it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse principle

that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is

shown to be prohibited by law. As a matter of general principle,

prohibitions cannot be presumed; and in the present case, therefore,

it rests upon the defendants to show that the suit in the form in

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

75

which it has been brought is prohibited by the rules of procedure

applicable to the Court of Justice in India.

Thus, it is my considered view that the principle of law, every

procedure is to be understood as permissible until it is shown to be

prohibited by the law, is clearly not the correct one to be acted upon in

relation to the applications before the Court of Appeal. In the

circumstances, a question necessarily arises as to what then is the principle

of law on which the Court of Appeal should have acted on in determining

the vires of the impugned Act?

The nature of the relief sought by the Petitioners before the Court of

Appeal is helpful to find an answer to this question. The Petitioners in CA

Writ Application No. 61/2012, sought inter alia a mandate in the nature of

a Writ of Certiorari, quashing the decision of the Land Survey Council

taken on 09.02.2012, marked as P14 to grant Annual Practising Licences

to the 12th to 70th Respondents named therein, along with a Writ of

Prohibition prohibiting said Respondent-Respondents from issuing Annual

Practising Licences to serving officers of the Survey Department to engage

in private practice. while in CA Writ Application Nos. 682/2011 and

98/2012 the Petitioners sought to quash the Field Staff Circular No.

05/2011. Thus, the decisions that were being impugned before the Court of

Appeal relates to the minutes of the Land Survey Council, containing its

decision to grant Annual Practising Licences to the 12th to 70th Respondent,

as adopted by the majority of votes by that Council, at its 103rd meeting

held on 09.02.2012 and the issuance of the said Circular by the Surveyor

General.

Decision of the Land Survey Council

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

76

The validity of the issuance of the said Circular is already

considered along with the provisions contained in the Establishments

Code and the letter dated 11.11.2011 issued by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Lands and Land Development, during early part of this

judgment. Hence, at this stage, it is proposed to consider the challenge

mounted by the Petitioners of CA Writ Application No. 61/2012 on the

vires of the impugned decision taken by the Land Survey Council.

The Land Survey Council was established by Section 26(1) of the

Act. Section 37 specifies the functions and duties of the Council, while

Section 38 specifies its powers. Thus, the Land Survey Council is clearly a

statutory body created by statute and conferred with powers and functions

also by specific statutory provisions governing its nature and extent.

Reverting to the determination made by the Court of Appeal, when

it stated [I]f the legislature intended not to issue Annual Practising Licences for

the Government Surveyors to engage in private practice, then it should have been

expressly stated in the Act, and not vice versa. Nowhere in the Act does not say

that a Government Surveyor is prohibited from obtaining an Annual Practising

Licence. It is well accepted principle that prohibitions cannot be presumed, it is

relevant to quote from a judgment of the Court of Appeal (Liyanage and

Others v Gampaha Urban Council and Others (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 1), in which

an approach, converse to the one taken by that Court in the instant

appeals, was taken but on a sound legal principle.

The issue to be decided by the Court of Appeal in that particular

instance was whether the Gampaha Urban Council has exceeded its power

conferred by the statute, in establishing a weekly fair on Market Street. SN

Silva J (as he then was) considered the vires of the Council in establishing a

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

77

weekly fair, in terms of the statutory provisions contained in the Urban

Council Ordinance. After an exhaustive analysis of English authorities and

authoritative texts on this point, inclusive of Wade on Administrative Law,

his Lordship expressed the view that (at p.7) [A]n authority (Corporation)

established by statute such as an Urban Council has, in law, a status, objects,

powers, functions and duties, only as provided in the constituent statute or in any

other statute. Beyond these it is legally incapable of doing anything.

In the judgment of this Court of Ven. Ellawala Medananda Thero v

District Secretary, Ampara and Others (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 54, SN Silva CJ re-

affirmed the said principle by inserting a quotation from his earlier

judgment (at p. 66) which states that [A]nything purported to be done, by

the Council, in excess of what is permitted by the statutory provisions will be

considered as wholly invalid in law, on the application of the doctrine of ultra

vires. However, in construing the relevant statutory provisions the Court will

bear in mind the need to promote the general legislative purpose underlying these

provisions and consider whether the impugned act is incidental to or

consequential upon the express provisions. If it is so considered necessary, the

impugned act will not be declared ultra vires."

This principle of law, acted on by his Lordship in both these

instances, is further clarified by Wade (10th Ed, at p. 179) in stating [W]hen

the question arises whether a public authority is acting lawfully or unlawfully, the

nature and extent of its power or duty has to be found in most cases by seeking the

intention of Parliament as expressed or implied in the relevant Act. It further

stated (ibid, at p.180) it must be remembered that the Courts intervene only

where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or

consequential.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

78

In an instance where the same principle, which the Court of Appeal

acted on, in determining the three applications before it, was applied by

Sir Robert Megarry VC, ( in Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioners

[1979] Ch 344), by permitting telephone tapping by the police, on the basis

that if such tapping can be carried out without committing any breach of the

law, it requires no authorisation by statute or common law; it can lawfully be done

simply because there is nothing to make it unlawful as England is not a

country where everything is expressly permitted; it is a country where everything

is permitted except what is expressly forbidden. That decision was interfered

with by European Court of Human Rights in Malone v UK 7 EHRR 14, by

stating that the interference resulting from the existence of the practice in

question was not in accordance with the law , for the purpose of Article 8.

Apparently, the Interception of communications Act 1985 was introduced

in England to provide the statutory framework for telephone tapping.

De Smith, in his authoritative text on Judicial Review (8th Ed), having

posed the question (at p. 256), to what extent is Government permitted to

achieve its aims by extra-statutory means ?, proceeded to answer the same

(at p. 257) by stating:

[W]hile central Government must be able to carry out incidental

functions that are not in conflict with its statutory powers, it is

wrong to equate the principle pertaining to private individuals-that

they may do everything which is not specifically forbidden-with the

powers of ministers, where the opposite is true. Any action they take

must be justified by a law which defines its purpose and justifies its

existence. The extension of Ram doctrine beyond its modest initial

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

79

purpose of achieving incidental powers should be resisted in the

interest of the rule of law.

It is common ground that the Survey Act has failed to indicate the

legislative intent unambiguously to grant Annual Practising Licences to

registered Surveyors, who are currently employed in the Surveyor

Department with an express provision of law. Thus, in the absence of a

specific provision, by which the Council is conferred with authority to

issue Annual Practising Licences, the impugned decision must therefore be

termed as a decision taken ultra vires of the powers of the Council. The

question whether granting such licences to this specific group of registered

surveyors (as contended by the Petitioners), in such circumstances, are

caught up within the term incidental to or consequential to the powers

conferred on that Council, though need not be considered in detail, but for

the sake of completeness, shall be addressed next.

In Ven. Ellawala Medananda Thero v District Secretary, Ampara

and Others (supra), this Court stated that in construing the relevant

statutory provisions the Court will bear in mind the need to promote the general

legislative purpose underlying these provisions and consider whether the

impugned act is incidental to or consequential upon the express provisions. If it is

so considered necessary, the impugned act will not be declared ultra vires. I am

in respectful agreement with the underlying principle on which his

Lordship acted upon, for it is perfectly in line with contemporary public

law principles, which I have already referred to earlier on in this section.

Now I proceed to consider the legality of the impugned decision

taken by Council to issue Annual Practising Licences to some of the

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

80

Respondents, in the light of the principle of law acted upon by this Court

in the case referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.

In dealing with this issue, I prefer to consider the nature of the

proceedings before the Council that has taken place, before the impugned

decision was taken by that Council.

Item No. 103.5 of the minutes of the 103rd meeting of the Land

Survey Council held on 09.02.2012, is regarding the issue of Annual

Practising Licences 2012. The relevant section of the minutes of the

Council on this item reads thus:

Considering the AC Writ 682/2011 received by LSC during the

101st meeting issuing licenses to SLSS officers were postponed until

getting AGs advice. AG was informed all history about the issuance

of license to SLSS officers, and LSC received advice saying the LSC

can proceed until getting writ. Hence, Chairman/LSC has asked

about the Council members views regarding giving licenses to SLSS

officers.

The SISL appointed Council members made their views against

giving licenses to SLSS officers. due to the different views from

the Council members on this issue, Chairman/LSC requested voting

from the Council members, and then, four votes were received in

favour of giving license to SLSS officers and three votes (from the

SISL appointed members) were received against giving license.

The minutes of the Council in relation to item 103.5 indicate what it

considered under that item. The minutes do not indicate that the Council

was to consider applications submitted by the registered surveyors, who

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

81

are desirous of practicing or attempting or professing to practise land

surveying and made requests to the Council for issuance of Annual

Practising Licences for the year 2012, during that meeting, as per its

mandate. Instead, the minutes indicate the issue considered by the Council

was whether it could grant Annual Practising Licences to officers of the

SLSS ( Sri Lanka Survey Service).

It could well be that the Council was aware that the officers of SLSS

are not only registered surveyors, but they also fall into the subgroup of

registered surveyors, who are employed in the Survey Department and

under the control of the Surveyor General engaged in land surveying on

behalf of the Government, as recognised by the Act itself. Thus, in my view

the Council had acted in excess of its functions, as set out in Section 37(c)

and 41(1) when it accepted their applications for the purpose of issuing

Annual Practising Licences, as the officers of SLSS could not be taken as

registered surveyors who are desirous of practicing or attempting or

professing to practise land surveying. There can be no doubt that the officers

of SLSS are public officers, whose salaries are paid by the Government and

are engaged in land surveying on behalf of the Government, during office

hours of all working days of the week.

Moreover, there is no assessment made by the Council that each of

these officers could therefore be considered as registered surveyors who

are desirous of practicing or attempting or professing to practise land

surveying but it opted to act merely on their request for permission to do

private practice.

Thus, in the absence of any reference to the said group of registered

surveyors either in Section 41(1) or 41(2), the Council had no power

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

82

conferred upon it by Section 41(2) to grant Annual Practising Licence to

the members of that group and, in this particular instance, by arriving at a

decision, to issue Annual Practising Licences to them, had acted ultra vires

of its powers and functions.

In addition, another factor contributed to the arbitrariness of the

Council in making the impugned decision. In terms of Sections 37(c), 41(1)

and 41(2), it is a function of the Council to receive applications from

registered surveyors for the issuance of Annual Practising Licences. These

Sections further imposes several criteria, which must first be established to

the satisfaction of the Council by such an applicant before the Council

making a decision. Section 37(c) states that if the Council is satisfied that

such surveyors possess the knowledge and skill to practice the profession of land

surveying only it could issue such licenses. If such surveyors have applied

for licenses from the Council in terms of Section 41(1), it may issue them

with such licenses, if it is satisfied that he has followed the prescribed courses of

study and training approved by the Council and acquired knowledge and skill to

practice land surveying, per Section 41(2).

It could well be that the officers of SLSS may have acquired the

prescribed qualifications or experience the Sections speak of, but in

addition they also must have the ability and skills to practice land

surveying is another requirement that should have been taken into

consideration by the Council before making a decision. Instead of

assessing merits of each applicant to satisfy itself that they had such

ability and skill, the Council had decided to take that factor for granted as

if those applicants have automatically fulfilled that requirement en bloc.

Even if this Court was to accept the contention of the Respondents for

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

83

arguments sake that the Council had the power to grant Annual

Practising Licence to them, the relevant minutes of the Council however

made no indication that it was satisfied itself that the applicants, who

applied seeking issuance of such licenses, have fulfilled the statutory

requirements imposed by Sections 37 and 41.

The impugned decision of the Council is therefore clearly be termed

as act ultra vires of its statutory powers and functions, in view of the

principle of law laid down in Ven. Ellawala Medananda Thero v District

Secretary, Ampara and Others (supra) which states that [A]n authority

(Corporation) established by statute has, in law, a status, objects, powers,

functions and duties, only as provided in the constituent statute or in any other

statute. Beyond these it is legally incapable of doing anything. Application of

this principle is subjected to an important qualification referred to by SN

Silva CJ by stating that [H]owever, in construing the relevant statutory

provisions the Court will bear in mind the need to promote the general legislative

purpose underlying these provisions and consider whether the impugned act is

incidental to or consequential upon the express provisions. If it is so considered

necessary, the impugned act will not be declared ultra vires.

In relation to the instant appeals, the question of whether the

impugned decision taken by the Council could be termed as an act which

is incidental to or consequential upon the express provisions does not arise for

consideration due to the reason that , if a particular act is to be considered

incidental or consequential upon an express provision of law, there must

be a statutory provision that specifies and confers that power on that

public body and if in the exercise of that power, anything that is incidental

to or consequential upon the express provisions could have been permitted. In

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

84

the case of Liyanage and Others v Gampaha Urban Council and Others

(supra) the necessity to consider whether the impugned act could be

considered as an instance of exercising statutory power, is incidental to or

consequential upon the express provisions arose because the law expressly

conferred authority over the Council to conduct a weekly fair and, when it

permitted such a fair on a public street causing obstruction to traffic, only

it was ruled acted in ultra vires.

The Conclusion

In the absence of an express provision of law to grant Annual

Practising Licences to registered surveyors, who are engaged in land

surveying on behalf of the Government, there cannot be any acts that

could be permitted as incidental to or consequential, which would be then

lie outside the scope of the enabling provision. Hence, the Petitioners are

entitled to have the impugned decision of the Council, and the issuance of

the Field Staff Circular by the Surveyor General, quashed by way of a Writ

of Certiorari and prevent the relevant Respondents from taking any further

action on that decision of the Council and on the said Circular by issuance

of a Writ of Prohibition.

The contention presented before this Court by the Respondents that,

in the absence of an express provision prohibiting granting such licenses,

the decision of the Council ought to be considered as intra vires, could be

construed as an instance where they have relied upon the proposition

what the Legislature has not written, the Court must write. In this context, its

apt to reproduce the very quotation inserted by Mark Fernando J in the

judgment of Ratnasinham v Dasanaike and Others (supra) which reads:

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

85

This proposition cannot be supported. It appears to me a naked

usurpation of the legislative function under the thin guise of

interpretation, and it is less justifiable when it is guesswork with

what material the legislature would, if it had discovered the gap,

have filled it in. If a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending

Act.

In view of the reasons, which I have set out in detail and contained

in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, the questions of law that

were to be determined by this Court on the instant appeals are answered

as follows:

1. Whether or not Government Surveyors can do private

practice in terms of Survey Act No. 17 of 2002? No

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to appreciate

whether the issuance of the impugned circular is irrational

and/or arbitrary and /or unreasonable? Yes.

3. Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider the impact of the

other Statues such as Land Registration Act, Title

Registration Act and Partition Law when considering

reasonableness of the impugned circular? Not all the Acts

referred to by the Petitioners.

4(a). Does the circular fall within the purview or provisions

of Survey Act No. 17 of 2002? No.

4(b). If so, can the circular be challenged on the question of

law formulated in Questions of Law Nos. 2 and 3

above? Yes.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

86

This Court, therefore, proceeds to make the following orders:

1. The petitioners of CA Writ Application Nos. 98/2012 are entitled

to the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the prayer to

the petition dated 01.04.2012 by issuance of Writs of Certiorari

and Prohibition quashing and implementing the Field Staff

Circular No. 05/2011 dated 25.11.2011.

2. The Petitioner of CA Writ Application Nos. 682/2011 is entitled

to the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to

the petition dated 15.12.2012, by issuance of Writs of Certiorari

and Prohibition quashing and implementing the Field Staff

Circular No. 05/2011 dated 25.11.2011.

3. The Petitioner of CA Writ Application Nos. 61/2012 is entitled to

the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to

the petition dated 27.02.2012, by issuance of Writs of Certiorari

and Prohibition quashing the decision of the Land Survey Council

dated 09.02.2012 to grant Annual Practising Licences to the 12th to

70th Respondents (named in the caption to the said application)

and prohibiting the 1st to 9th Respondents (also named in the said

caption) from issuing such licenses to surveyors, who are

employed in Survey Department, to engage in private practice.

4. The consolidated judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced

on 11.09.2019 in relation to CA Writ Application Nos. 682/2011,

61/2012 and 98/2012, is hereby set aside.

S.C. Appeal Nos. 85/2021 with 86/2021 and 87/2021

5. The corresponding appeals of the Petitioners in SC Appeal Nos.

85/2021, 86/2021 and 87/2021 are accordingly allowed.

6. Parties will bear their costs.
