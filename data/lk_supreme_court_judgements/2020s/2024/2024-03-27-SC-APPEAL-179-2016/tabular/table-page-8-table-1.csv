"Ltd  v  Jayawardane  et  al  [2007]  1  SLR  181,  even  though  a  bank  has  no  authority  to  invoke"
"provisions  authorizing  parate  execution  in  relation  to  a  property  belonging  to  a  third  party"
"pledged  as  security  to  a  loan  obtained  from  the  bank,  the  District  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to"
"make a determination on the validity of a sale conducted under the provisions of the Act due to"
"the statutory scheme as discussed hereinbefore. The learned trial judge is of the view that it is the"
"Court  of  Appeal  that  has  the  jurisdiction  to  examine  the  legality  of  the  certificate  of  sale  and"
"grant relief."
