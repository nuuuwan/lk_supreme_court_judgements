The question raised is whether this course of action was legal and whether the Court of Appeal erred in doing so. In the Court of Appeal, the Additional Solicitor General has submitted that the learned High Court Judge has neither convicted nor acquitted the 3rd accused for count No.4 and urged the Court of Appeal to convict the 3rd accused for Count No.4 and sentence accordingly.

AG [1999] 2 Sri L.R. page 324 referred to in the question of law which was brought to the attention of this Court by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd accused must be distinguished from the instant case. In the case of Upul De Silva V. AG (supra), the accused was indicted in the High Court with the offence of criminal breach of trust and offence of using forged documents but was acquitted on both charges and instead was convicted for criminal misappropriation. On an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the evidence that was adduced during the trial made out a sufficient case for criminal breach of trust and ordered a retrial while setting aside the conviction and sentence. It was held that, where the Court of Appeal acting under Section 335(2)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act orders a retrial upon a determination of an appeal against a conviction, such retrial must be strictly limited to the offence upon which the accused had been convicted by the trial Court, and against which he had preferred an appeal and none other. The Supreme Court referred to the case of Andra Pradesh V. Thadi Narayanan [1962] AIR 240 which held that, when an order of conviction is challenged by the convicted person, but the order of acquittal was not challenged by the state, it is only the order of conviction that was to be considered by the Appellate Court and not the order of acquittal. However, unlike in Upul De Silva V. AG, in the instant case, there was neither an acquittal nor a conviction explicitly ordered by the learned Judges of the High Court against the 3rd accused on count No.4. Instead, there was merely an omission to record the conviction/acquittal. Therefore, the principles established in the case of Upul De Silva are not applicable to the present matter, as there is no formal finding of either an acquittal or a conviction in the case at hand.",

    "text": "Whilst the police officers were waiting, they have observed that a three-wheeler arrived and parked in front of the house of the 1st accused. Then the 1st accused has come out from the small gate and has collected two black coloured plastic bags from the three-wheeler driver (2nd accused). With the two black coloured bags the 1st accused has gone inside the house. After about 10 minutes the 1st accused has returned carrying a white coloured bag. When IP Liyanage approached the accused, the 1st accused has tried to avoid him, however, upon identifying themselves as police officers they have searched the bag. Upon search of the bag, they have discovered another bag inside which contained Heroin. They have arrested both the 1st and the 2nd accused. With both the accused the Police officers have gone inside the house to search further. Inside the bedroom, the 3rd accused had been arranging clothes in the almirah. Police officers have found a blue coloured travelling bag that was not locked, under the bed. Inside the said travelling bag there had been ten bags containing Heroin, two bags containing Rs. 518850/- cash, and four scales. It was evident that the bedroom in which the travelling bag that contained the Heroin and other productions was found, was the room that was used by the 1st and 3rd accused who were husband and wife. In her dock statement, the 3rd accused raised the defense that the alleged suitcase containing the heroin could not have fit under her bed. She further contended that this allegation was fabricated by the police as an attempt to frame her and her husband, due to some animosity that existed between the police and her husband. Her defence was not that she had no knowledge of the contents in the suitcase, but the suit case could not fit in under the bed. That was to say that the suit case was a plant by the Police. In cases involving joint possession, one of the key elements that must be established is the knowledge of the presence of the illicit substance. In the present case, the learned High Court Judge as well as the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have carefully analyzed the evidence adduced in the High Court. The suitcase which contained the heroin was recovered in the presence of the 3rd accused under the bed in the bedroom that was shared by the 1st and the 3rd accused who were husband and wife.
