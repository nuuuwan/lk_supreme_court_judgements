"by  the  case  precedence  from  Indian  Courts  discussed  above,"
"such  omission  does  not  amount  to  an  acquittal,  but  rather"
"reflects a procedural error/ oversight. In this regard, the Court of"
"Appeal has rightly exercised its authority to rectify this error and"
"appropriately  proceeded  to  convict  the  3rd  accused  for  the  4th"
"Count."
"Further, the position taken in the case of Upul De Silva V. AG"
"[1999]  2  Sri  L.R.  page  324  referred  to  in  the  question  of  law"
"which was brought to the attention of this Court by the learned"
"Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  for  the  3rd  accused  must  be  distinguished"
"from the instant case. In the case of Upul De Silva V. AG (supra),"
"the accused  was  indicted  in  the High Court  with the offence of"
"criminal breach of trust and offence of using forged documents"
"but was acquitted on both charges and instead was convicted for"
"criminal  misappropriation.  On  an  appeal  by  the  accused,  the"
"Court  of  Appeal  was  of  the  view  that  the  evidence  that  was"
"adduced during the trial made out a sufficient case for criminal"
"breach  of  trust  and  ordered  a  retrial  while  setting  aside  the"
"conviction  and  sentence.  It  was  held  that,  where  the  Court  of"
"Appeal  acting  under  Section  335(2)(a)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act orders a retrial upon a determination of an appeal"
"against a conviction, such retrial must be strictly limited to the"
"offence upon which the accused had been convicted by the trial"
"Court, and against which he had preferred an appeal and none"
"other. The Supreme Court referred to the case of Andra Pradesh"
"V. Thadi Narayanan [1962] AIR 240 which held that, when an"
"order of conviction is challenged by the convicted person, but the"
"order of acquittal was not challenged by the state, it is only the"
"order  of  conviction  that  was  to  be  considered  by  the  Appellate"
"Court and not the order of acquittal."
"H
owever,  unlike  in  Upul  De  Silva  V.  AG,  in  the  instant  case,"
"there was neither an acquittal nor a conviction explicitly ordered"
"by the learned Judges of the High Court against the 3rd accused"
"on count No.4. Instead, there was merely an omission to record"
"the  conviction/acquittal.  Therefore,  the  principles  established"
"in the  case  of  Upul  De  Silva  are  not  applicable  to  the  present"
"matter, as there is no formal finding of either  an acquittal or a"
"conviction in the case at hand."
