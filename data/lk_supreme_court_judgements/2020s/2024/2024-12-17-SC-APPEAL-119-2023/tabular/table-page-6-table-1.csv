"there has been an acquittal by implication on the charges under"
"section 366 the Court, referring to case of Ragunath and others"
"V. Emperor (supra), held as follows;"
"“The  case  of  Ragunath  V  Emperor…Certain  persons"
"were charged under Section 304 and 147, I.P.C., but"
"the sessions Judge competed them under Section 304"
"I.P.C.  only.  He  was  of  opinion  that  the  accused  had"
"committed rioting, but he omitted to record a conviction"
"under section 147, I.P.C. It was held by this Court that"
"it  was  open  to  the  High  Court  under  Section  423,"
"Criminal  P.C.,  to  convict  the  accused  under  section"
"147, I.P.C., inasmuch as there was no acquittal on the"
"charge under that section, but merely an omission to"
"record a conviction.”"
