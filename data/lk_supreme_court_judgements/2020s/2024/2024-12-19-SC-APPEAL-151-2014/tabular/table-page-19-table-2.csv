"n Sri Lanka Ports Authority v Pieris [(1981) 1 Sri LR 101, at 108], Sharvananda J. (as he"
"then was) stated that:"
"“Article 127 spells the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. The appellate jurisdiction"
"extends to the correction of all errors in fact and/or in law which shall be committed"
"by the Court of Appeal or any court of first instance. There is no provision inhibiting"
"this Court from exercising its appellate jurisdiction once that jurisdiction is invoked."
"On reading Articles 127 and 128 together, it would appear that once leave to appeal"
"is granted by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and this Court is seised of the"
"appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court to correct all errors in fact or in law which had"
"been committed by the Court of Appeal or court of first instance is not limited but is"
"exhaustive.  Leave  to  appeal  is  the  key  which  unlocks  the  door  into  the  Supreme"
"Court,  and  once  a  litigant  has  passed  through  the  door,  he  is  free  to  invoke  the"
"appellate jurisdiction of this Court “for the correction of all errors in fact and/or in"
"law which had been committed by the Court of Appeal or any court of first instance.”"
