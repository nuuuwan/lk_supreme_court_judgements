"Whilst recognising that a party to an action cannot, for the first time before the Supreme"
"Court, take up new positions which are not pure questions of law, Sharvananda J (as he"
"then  was)  expressed  a  view  similar  to  that  expressed  above  in  Albert  v  Veeriahpillai"
"[(1981) 1 Sri LR 110, at page 113] when he stated that the appellate jurisdiction of the"
"Supreme Court, “extends to  the correction  of all errors in  fact or  in law which shall be"
"committed by the Court of Appeal or any Court of First Instance (vide Article 127 of the"
"Constitution)… The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is very wide in its amplitude, as it"
"should be, it being the final Court of Appeal.”"
