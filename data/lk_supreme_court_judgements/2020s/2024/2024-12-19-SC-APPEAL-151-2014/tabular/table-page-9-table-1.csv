"property. In either of the two ways, the writ of execution so issued is valid for a period of"
"one year and where it is not executed, may be extended for periods of one year at a time,"
"subject to the limitation of ten years set out in Section 337(1)."
"E
ven though the decree was entered on 11th November 1993, the parties had agreed that"
"the  Defendant  shall  be  entitled  to  occupy  the  premises  until  11th  May  1996.  With  the"
"Defendant having gone back on his undertaking to hand over the premises on that date,"
"the entitlement of the Plaintiff to take steps for execution of the decree arose only on"
"11th May 1996. Thus, the operative date for the purposes of Section 337(1) was 11th May"
"1996.  The  application  for  execution  of  the  writ  was  made  on  23rd  May  1996.  This"
"application,  which  I  shall  refer  to  as  the  first  application,  is  therefore  compliant  with"
"Section 337(1)."

alculation of the ten year period by the District Court and the High Court"
"A
lthough the writ of execution was granted by the District Court on 27th May 1996, the"
"entire process came to a grinding halt with the revision application filed in the Court of"
"Appeal and upon the Court of Appeal granting an interim order on 26th February 1997"
"staying  the  execution  of  the  writ  pending  the  final  determination  of  the  said  revision"
"application. At the time this interim order was issued, the first application was still within"
"its validity period of one year. With the Court of Appeal having recognised the right of the"
"Plaintiff  to  make  a  fresh  application,  the  Plaintiff  did  so  by  his  petition  filed  on  18th"
"February 2008. When taken from the operative date of 11th May 1996, on the face of it,"
"the fresh application, which I shall refer to as the second application, is clearly outside the"
"time period of ten years provided by Section 337(1) and for that reason, the District Court,"
"by its Order delivered on 21st January 2009 took the view that the second application was"
"outside the time period specified in Section 337(1) and refused the application for a writ"
"to execute the decree."
"T
he High Court quite correctly took the view that the District Court had failed to consider"
"that  the  interim  order  issued  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  prevented  the  Plaintiff  from"
"executing the writ. The High Court held further that, (a) the entitlement of the Plaintiff to"
"make an application arose only on 31st May 1999 with the delivery of the judgment of the"
"Court of Appeal, (b) the operative date shall be 31st May 1999, and (c) with the second"
