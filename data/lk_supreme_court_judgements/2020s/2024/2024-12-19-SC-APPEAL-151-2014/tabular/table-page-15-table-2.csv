"time period for preferring such application has been specified in Section 757(1)."
"T
he Plaintiff proceeded on the basis that the impugned Order came within (b) above and"
"filed a notice of appeal and a petition of appeal, only for the Substituted Defendants to"
"take up the objection that the order delivered by the District Court is only an order, and"
"hence the Plaintiff ought to have filed an application seeking leave to appeal. The High"
"Court overruled the said objection and held that the order of the District Court has the"
"effect of a final judgment and that the procedure followed by the Plaintiff was correct."
