"Court considered the impact of alleged procedural irregularities committed by an Arbitral"
"Tribunal  in  the  context  of  the  award  being  against  the  public  policy  and  observed  that:"
"“Every procedural violation does not give rise to a violation of public policy. It must be of"
"a fundamental nature... Hence enforcement of an arbitral tribunal may be refused on the"
"ground of public policy in the event that there has been a breach of the rules of natural"
"justice or due process.” (at page 29)."
