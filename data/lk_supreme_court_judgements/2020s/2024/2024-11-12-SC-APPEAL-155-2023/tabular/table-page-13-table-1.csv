"not fall within the ambit of “reimbursable taxes” nor under “change in law event” under"
"the  agreement.  It  was  contended  that  recovering  the  amounts  paid  to  the Respondent  on"
"the basis of their claim in the invoices, is justified and is in accordance with the provisions"
"of  the  agreement.  In  the  Statement  of  Defence  filed  before  the  Tribunal,  the  Appellant"
"contended  that  “dividend  tax  was  not  a  tax  expense  incurred  by  the  claimant  company"
"itself at all, but was only a tax paid by the claimant in terms of section 61 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act No 10 of 2006 as amended by Act no 10 of 2007 and recovered by way of"
"deduction, from  the amount  of gross dividend  payable to  the claimant’s  shareholder/s in"
"terms  of section 65 of the said  Act”.  It  was  further contended “furthermore, this duty to"
"recover Dividend Tax paid by a company from its shareholders was mandatory in terms of"
"Section 65 of the said  Act”.  It  is  on this basis the Appellant  contested the Respondent’s"
"claim  before the Arbitral Tribunal. The sole witness  – the accountant of the Respondent"
"company  –  had  been  cross  examined  extensively.  Even  though,  the  witness  at  one  point"
"conceded  that  the  Respondent  could  not  have  claimed  the  payment  under  “reimbursable"
"taxes”,  the  witness  has  taken  up  the  position  that  the  payment  of  Dividend  Tax  was  an"
"expense incurred by the Respondent company. Furthermore, the witness had taken up the"
"position  that  the  change  had  an  impact  on  the  costs  of  the  Respondent  which  had  an"
"impact on the tariff.  However, this position was disputed by the Appellant. On behalf of"
"the  Appellant,  it  had  been  contended  that  the  Respondent  was  not  entitled  to  seek  a"
"payment  based  on  the  Dividend  tax  paid  to  the  State.  As  such  payment  did  not  come"
"within the purview of either “reimbursable taxes” or “change in law event” as stipulated"
"by the agreement between the two parties. The Appellant has taken up the same position in"
"the  written  submissions  and  has  further  elaborated  its  contention  on  the  relevant  issues"
"raised before the Tribunal."
