"that the Award is patently illegal and the award is contrary to public policy?. In my view"
"the facts before this Court does not lend support to answer this question in the affirmative."
"The Inland Revenue Act makes provision relating to one of the main sources of revenue to"
"the  State.  Therefore,  there  is  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  the  provisions  of  the  Act  are"
"correctly interpreted and that the State would not be deprived or denied the collection of"
"revenue it is lawfully entitled to. If the State is denied this opportunity due to an error in"
"the interpretation of any of the provisions of the statute such denial would have a serious"
"adverse impact on the State. Such an error would defeat the object of the relevant statute"
"and would cause harm to the State as well as to the citizenry. An award with such an error"
"could be termed as an award that is patently illegal and the enforcement of such an award"
"would  be  contrary  to  public  policy.  It  is  reasonable  to  adopt  such  a  test  to  determine"
"whether an Award should be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to public policy due"
"to an error of the Tribunal in its interpretation of any statutory provision. If the ill effects"
"of an error on the interpretation of any statutory provision by the Tribunal impacts upon"
"the  State  or  any  other  third  party,  setting  aside  of  such  an  award  on  the  basis  of  public"
"policy  in  my  view  falls  within  the  ambit  of  Section  32(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Arbitration  Act."
"Hence  each  and  every  error  on  interpreting  a  statute  would  not  be  a  valid  ground  to  set"
"aside an arbitral award."
