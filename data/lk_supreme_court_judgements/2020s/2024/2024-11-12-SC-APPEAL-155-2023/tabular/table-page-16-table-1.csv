"“The award could be set aside if it is against public policy of India, that is to say, if it is"
"contrary to"
"(a) Fundamental policy of Indian Law;"
"(b) The interest of India; or"
"(c)  Justice or morality; or"
"(d) It is patently illegal”"

"I
n  reaching  this  decision  the  Indian  Supreme  Court  had  expressed  the  view  that  in  the"
"context of determining the issue of public policy in relation to an application to set aside"
"an arbitral award a “…wider meaning is required to be given so that the ‘patently illegal"
"award’  passed  by  the  Arbitral  Tribunal  could  be  set  aside.  If  narrow  meaning  is  given,"
"some of the provisions of the Arbitration Act would become nugatory” (at page 2641).  It"
"is on this basis that the Court identified the aforesaid four factors that could be considered"
"in  determining  whether  an  arbitral  award  is  contrary  to  public  policy  or  not.  It  is  also"
"equally  pertinent  to  note  that  the  Supreme  Court  of  India  in  reaching  this  decision,  has"
"exercised its jurisdiction similar to a situation  where it exercises appellate or  revisionary"
"jurisdiction even though the subject matter before the Court was a challenge to an arbitral"
"award based on “public policy”. This is aptly reflected in the following observations of the"
"Court:"
"“From the judgments discussed above, it can be held that the term ‘public policy of India’"
"is  required  to  be  interpreted  in  the  context  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  where  the"
"validity of the award is challenged before it becomes final and executable. The concept of"
"enforcement  of  the  award  after  it  becomes  final  is  different  and  the  jurisdiction  of  the"
"Court at that stage is could be limited. Similar is the position with regard to the execution"
"of a decree. It is settle law as well as it is provided under the Code of Civil Procedure that"
"once  the  decree  has  attained  finality,  in  an  execution  proceeding,  it  may  be  challenged"
"only on limited grounds such as the decree being without jurisdiction or nullity. But in a"
"case where the judgment and decree is challenged before the appellate court or the court"
"exercising revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of such court would be wider. Therefore,"
"in  a  case  where  the  validity  of  award  is  challenged  there  is  no  necessity  of  giving  a"
"narrower  meaning  to  the  term  ‘public  policy  of  India’”  (at  page  2641).  Therefore,  the"
"Supreme  Court  of  India  has  described  that  when  an  arbitral  award  is  impugned  on  the"
