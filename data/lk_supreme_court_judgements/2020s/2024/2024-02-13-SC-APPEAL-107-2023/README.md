SC/APPEAL/107/2023

Written Submissions:

By the Appellant on 28.12.2023

Argued on: 16.01.2024

Decided on: 13.02.2024

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed action in the District Court of Gampaha seeking a

declaration of title to, and ejectment of the defendant from, the land

described in the schedule to the plaint, and damages. The defendant filed

answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration that

the defendant is the owner of the land.

On the 5th date of trial, the defendant being absent and unrepresented,

the case was fixed for ex parte trial. After the ex parte trial, the judgment

was pronounced on 17.11.2017. Upon the ex parte decree being served

on the defendant, the defendant made an application under section 86(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code to vacate the ex parte decree.

At the inquiry into this application, learned counsel for the plaintiff raised

a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the application on the

basis that the application was bad in law since the defendant had not

prayed for setting aside the ex parte judgment and the decree. This

preliminary objection was upheld by the District Court and the plaintiffs

application was dismissed in limine by order dated 31.05.2019.

The defendant filed a final appeal against this order in terms of section

754(1) read with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code (by way of

Notice of Appeal followed by Petition of Appeal as stipulated in section

755 of the Civil Procedure Code).

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

The defendant did not participate in the argument before the High Court

of Civil Appeal.

As seen from the post-argument written submissions filed on behalf of

the plaintiff before the High Court of Civil Appeal, the principal

submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff before the High Court was

that the final appeal filed against the order of the District Court dated

31.05.2019 was misconceived in law. By citing Chettiar v. Chettiar [2011]

2 Sri LR 70 in support, his argument was that the defendant ought to

have come before the High Court by way of a leave to appeal application,

not by way of final appeal.

The second submission of learned counsel before the High Court was that

the application filed by the defendant before the District Court under

section 86(2) was misconceived in law, as there was no relief seeking to

set aside the ex parte judgment and the decree.

The learned High Court Judge identified these two arguments presented

before him in the impugned judgment but, for reasons best known to

him, only dealt with the second submission and allowed the appeal by

judgment dated 31.05.2022. The learned High Court Judge completely

ignored the first submission.

This appeal by the plaintiff is against the judgment of the High Court.

This Court granted leave to appeal against the said judgment mainly on

two questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by not dismissing the

final appeal filed by the defendant since the correct remedy would

have been to file a leave to appeal application against the impugned

order dated 31.05.2019?

(b) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by concluding that the

defendant intended to set aside the ex parte judgment and the

5

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

decree dated 17.11.2017 in the absence of a prayer to that effect in

the application filed under section 86(2)?

The approach of the learned High Court Judge is completely erroneous.

He ought to have initially decided on the first submission, and thereafter

considered the second submission, if he ruled against the plaintiff on the

first. If he accepted the first submission, he had no choice but to dismiss

the appeal in limine. In such circumstances, consideration of the second

submission does not arise. The High Court cannot decide only on the

second submission and allow the appeal.

The main statutory provisions relevant to the first question of law are

sections 754(1), (2) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code and section 5 of

the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

Sections 754(1), (2) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code read as follows:

754 (1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment,

pronounced by any original court in any civil action, proceeding or

matter to which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the Court of

Appeal against such judgment for any error in fact or in law.

(2) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order made by

any original court in the course of any civil action, proceeding or

matter to which he is, or seeks to be a party, may prefer an appeal

to the Court of Appeal against such order for the correction of any

error in fact or in law, with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had

and obtained.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, for

the purposes of this chapter

judgment means any judgment or order having the effect of a final

judgment made by any civil court; and

6

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

order means the final expression of any decision in any civil action,

proceeding or matter, which is not a judgment.

According to Article 154P to the Constitution introduced by the 13th

Amendment, there shall be a High Court for each Province. The High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.19 of 1990, made

provisions regarding the procedure to be followed in, and the right to

appeal to and from, such High Court, and for matters connected

therewith. By this Act, the High Courts of the Provinces were granted

appellate jurisdiction primarily against the judgments and orders of the

Magistrates Courts, Primary Courts and Labour Tribunals within the

respective Provinces.

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) (Amendment) Act,

No. 54 of 2006, sections 5A, 5B and 5C were introduced to Act No. 19 of

1990. This was done to grant appellate jurisdiction to the Provincial High

Courts against the judgments and orders of the District Courts within

the respective Provinces. Those High Courts, although it is a misnomer,

are conveniently known as High Courts of Civil Appeal.

After the said amendment by Act No. 54 of 2006, section 5A of the

principal Act, No.19 of 1990 (without the proviso) reads as follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

for a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered

and made by any District Court or a Family Court within such

Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors

in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such District Court

or Family Court, as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of

1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the Civil

7

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to

the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the

Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a

reference to a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved by any

judgment, decree or order of a District Court or a Family Court, as

the case may be, within a Province, may invoke the jurisdiction

referred to in that subsection, in the High Court established for that

Province:

According to section 5A(2), the appellate procedure to be adopted in the

High Court of Civil Appeal is the same procedure which is being followed

in the Court of Appeal.

The issue of whether an appeal or leave to appeal is permissible against

an order of the District Court has been a matter of prolonged controversy.

Two approaches emerged: the order approach and the application

approach.

In the Supreme Court case of Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd [1984] 1 Sri

LR 286, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) followed the order approach adopted

by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council

[1903] 1 KB 547.

Conversely, in the Supreme Court case of Ranjit v. Kusumawathie [1998]

3 Sri LR 232, Dheeraratne J. followed the application approach adopted

by Lord Esher M.R. in Salaman v. Warner [1891] 1 QB 734 and Lord

Denning M.R. in Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597.

The order approach solely considers the nature of the order. If the order,

when taken in isolation, conclusively disposes of the matter in litigation

without leaving the suit alive, it is deemed final, and a final appeal is the

appropriate remedy against such an order.

8

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

The application approach solely considers the nature of the application

made to Court by a party, not the order delivered by Court on that

application. Following this approach, if the order, given in one way, will

conclusively dispose of the matter in litigation, but if given in the opposite

way, will allow the action to continue, the order is considered

interlocutory, in which event, leave to appeal is deemed the appropriate

remedy.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court, consisting of five Justices, was

tasked with deciding this contentious issue in Chettiar v. Chettiar [2011]

2 Sri LR 70. After discussing both approaches derived from English

decisions, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the application

approach, as opposed to the order approach, shall be the criterion for

deciding whether an appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy

against an order of the District Court.

This Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court was consistently followed

in later Supreme Court decisions (Yogendra v. Tharmaratnam

(SC/Appeal/87/2009, Supreme Court Minutes of 06.07.2011),

Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC/Appeal/03/2009, Supreme Court

Minutes of 16.03.2012), Prof. I.K. Perera v. Prof. Dayananda

Somasundara (SC/Appeal/152/2010, Supreme Court Minutes of

17.03.2011).

However, despite Chettiar v. Chettiar being a Full Bench decision of the

Supreme Court, doubts about the correctness of the decision persisted.

Hence, in Priyanthi Senanayake v. Chamika Jayantha [2017] BLR 74, a

Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court, consisting of seven Justices, revisited

the decision in Chettiars case. In the end, the Fuller Bench also arrived

at the same conclusion, namely, that the test to be applied is the

9

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

application approach and not the order approach. Chief Justice Dep, with

the concurrence of the other six Justices of the Supreme Court, held:

In order to decide whether an order is a final judgment or not, it is

my considered view that the proper approach is the approach

adopted by Lord Esher in Salamam v. Warner [1891] 1 QB 734,

which was cited with approval by Lord Denning in Salter Rex & Co.

v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597. It stated: If their decision, whichever

way it is given, will, if it stands, finally dispose of the matter in

dispute, I think that for that purpose of these Rules it is final. On the

other hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally dispose

of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other, will allow the action

to go on, then I think it is not final, but interlocutory.

It is abundantly clear that a direct appeal does not lie against the

impugned order of the District Court dated 31.05.2019, whereby the

Court rejected the application of the defendant made under section 86(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code upholding the preliminary objection raised by

the plaintiff. A direct appeal does not lie against that order because, had

the District Court overruled the preliminary objection, the main inquiry

would have proceeded, and the application would have been decided on

its merits. If I may repeat the test, if the order, given in one way, will

conclusively dispose of the matter in litigation, but if given in the opposite

way, will allow the action to continue, the order is considered

interlocutory, in which event, leave to appeal is deemed the appropriate

remedy.

To avoid any confusion, let me add one more point in connection with

Chettiars judgment. A Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court, comprising

seven Justices, held in Iranganie De Silva v. Indralatha [2017] BLR 68

that when the language of a statute is clear and the right of appeal is

given in express terms, as seen in section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure

10

SC/APPEAL/107/2023

Code prior to the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 5 of 2022,

which stated, The order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment

entered upon default shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating

upon the facts and specifying the grounds upon which it is made, and shall

be liable to an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision in Chettiars

case has no application. This is despite the fact that, under ordinary

circumstances, the application approach does not allow for a final appeal

to be filed against such an order.

The Petitioner should have gone before the High Court against the order

of the District Court not by way of a final appeal made under section

754(1) read with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code and section

5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of

1990, but by way of a leave to appeal application made under section

754(2) read with section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code and section

5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of

1990.

I answer the first question of law in the affirmative. The consideration of

the 2nd question of law does not arise. The judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal is set aside and the appeal is allowed. The final appeal filed

in the High Court against the order of the District Court dated 31.05.2019

shall stand dismissed.
