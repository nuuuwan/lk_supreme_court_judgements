"[3]","Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Judgment,  the  Appellant  made  an  application  to  the"
"","High Court seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in terms of Section 9 of"
"","the  High  Court  of  the  Provinces  (Special  Provisions)  Act  No.  19  of  1990  (as"
"","amended)."
"[4]","Having heard also considering the submissions by both parties, the High Court, by"
"","Order dated 11/08/2017, granted leave to appeal only on the sentence imposed by"
"","the High Court. In the circumstances, the conviction of the Accused-Appellant, of"
"","the offences as charged, stands affirmed."
"[5]","The  position  of  the  Accused-Appellant  is  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"","enhanced the punishment without affording the Appellant an opportunity to respond"
"","and/ or show cause why the punishment ought to be enhanced. The Counsel for the"
"","Appellant strongly contends that an enhanced sentence was imposed in the absence"
"","of an application by the State to do so. It is also contended that the learned High"
"","Court Judge did not consider sentencing guidelines prior to enhancing the sentence."
"[6]","It  is  observed,  that  the  Magistrateâ€™s  Court  is  empowered  to  try  the  Appellant  on"
"","offences as charged and the above  variation in sentence on count  1  and 3 by the"
"","High Court is within the exercise of judicial discretion of the sentencing judge."
"[7]","With leave of the High Court, the Counsel for the Accused-Appellant filed a motion"
"","dated  20/01/2017  seeking  leave  to  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court  against  the  said"
"","Judgment dated 05/01/2017. In terms of Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces"
"","(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 (as amended), the High Court can grant"
"","leave  to  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court,  ex  mere  moto  or  at  the  instance  of  any"
"","aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings. In support of the said motion, the"
"","Court permitted the Accused-Appellant to file written submissions, and accordingly"
"","written submissions dated 08/08/2017 was filed of record. Given the opportunity to"
"","show cause, the Accused-Appellant did not identify any issue of law ought to be"
"","considered by the High Court nor contended harshness or any other mitigating factor"
"","associated with the said enhanced sentence. An application to refer a point of law"
"","must plead reasons why that point should be considered by the High Court. Section"
