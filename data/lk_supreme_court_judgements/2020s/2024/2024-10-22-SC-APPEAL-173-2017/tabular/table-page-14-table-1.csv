"","considered the nature and the gravity of the offence, this Court finds that this is not"
"","a fit case to suspend the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate."
"[29]","Therefore, I answer the question of law which leave to appeal was granted in favour"
"","of  the  Accused-Appellant,  only  in  respect  of  variation  in  sentence,  which  is  not"
"","legally justifiable."
"[30]","For  these  reasons,  the  said  Judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  dated"
"","05/01/2017, convicting the Accused-Appellant is affirmed. However, the enhanced"
"","sentence given by the said Judgment is set aside and the sentence imposed by the"
"","learned Magistrate will stand restored. No costs ordered."
"","The Appeal is partly allowed."
