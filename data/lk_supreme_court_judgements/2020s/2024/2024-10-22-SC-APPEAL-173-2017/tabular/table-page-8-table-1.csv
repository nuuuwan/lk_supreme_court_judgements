"","High  Court.  The  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  cited  the  case  of  Indrawansa  vs."
"","Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Wennappuwa and Another4,  to emphasis upon"
"","the opportunity given to an aggrieved party to show cause justifying mitigatory or"
"","aggravating circumstances in mitigating the penalty, with reference to Section 303"
"","(1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979."
"[14]","In the above case the Court considered the decisions in Karunaratne vs. The State5,"
"","Attorney  General  vs.  Mendis6  and  stressed  upon  the  need  to  have  regard  to  the"
"","nature and the gravity of the offence, the presence of any aggravating or mitigatory"
"","factor concerning the offender, prior to any variation of sentence."
"[15]","The  Court  also  acknowledged  that  deterrence  serves  a  dual  purpose:  specific"
"","deterrence  to  prevent  the  individual  from  reoffending  and  general  deterrence  to"
"","reinforce the notion that 'crime does not pay,’ and on the question whether a sentence"
"","of imprisonment should remain or be suspended, the Court was of the view that;"
"","“When addressing the question of suspending a sentence, the gravity of the offence,"
"","the impact on the offender’s family, delay in sentencing, age, or ill health, pleading"
"","guilty in the first given opportunity, previous convictions, subsequent conduct of the"
"","accused  are  some  of  the  many  mitigatory  factors  that  a  court  may  consider."
"","Therefore, a case-by-case consideration of the offence, the offender-based factors"
"","and the interest of society is essential to decide whether a sentence of imprisonment"
"","should remain or be suspended”."
"[16]","As held in the case of Alister Anthoney Pereira vs. State of Maharashta7,"
"","“Sentencing policy is an important task in the matters of crime. One of the prime"
"","objectives  of  criminal 
law 
is 
imposition  of  appropriate  adequate 
just  and"
"","proportionate sentence commenced with the nature and gravity of the crime and the"
"","manner 
in  which 
the  crime 
is  done.  There 
is  no  straight-jacket 
formula
