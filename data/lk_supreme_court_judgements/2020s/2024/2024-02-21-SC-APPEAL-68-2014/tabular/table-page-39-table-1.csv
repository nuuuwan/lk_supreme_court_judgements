"[supra]. It involved a dispute between husband and wife married before the Ordinance as"
"to what constitutes joint property, where Ennis, J stated as follows, at page 257:"
"“  …  the  learned  Judge  has  held  that  all  property  purchased  after  the  date  of"
"marriage is presumed to be acquired  property  under the Tesawalamai until the"
"contrary is proved. The case in Muttukristna's Tesawalamai, at page 30, seems to"
"support that contention, and also in Katiresu's Tesawalamai two cases are cited for"
"the same proposition. The presumption would appear to be correct, because at the"
"time when the Tesawalamai was written it would seem that a son, before marriage"
"and during the lifetime of his father, could not hold for himself any property gained"
"or earned by him during the time of his bachelorhood; it all belonged to his father."
"So that on the marriage the property brought together, which is dealt with in section"
"1 of the Tesawalamai, would be, on the side of the husband, such property as the"
"son had received as a gift from his father, or, if his father had been dead at the time,"
"had inherited from him, and purchases after that would presumably be made from"
"the profits which section 1 distinctly says are acquired property.” [emphasis added]"
