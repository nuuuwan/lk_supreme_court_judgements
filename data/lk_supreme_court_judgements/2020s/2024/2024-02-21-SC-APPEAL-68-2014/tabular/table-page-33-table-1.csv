"","But in Manikkavasagar v Kandasamy and Others [supra], Chief Justice Sharvananda held"
"","that the above “enunciation [of Gratiaen, J] was not necessary for the decision of the case"
"","and was obiter dictum”, a view  which  has  also been  expressed  by  Chief  Justice  H.N.G."
"","Fernando in Annapillai v Eswaralingam and Others [62 NLR 224 at page 226]. Chief Justice"
"","Sharvananda went on to state that the new Section 20 does not alter the position that a"
"","non-acquiring  spouse  owns  one  half  of  the  Thediathetam  property  of  the  acquiring"
"","spouse. The argument that as the original Section 20 has been repealed, one cannot look"
"","back to the customary law of Thesawalamai or to the repealed Section 20 for the nature"
"","of  Thediathetam  but  one  must  decide  the  rights  of  parties  on  the  basis  that  the  new"
"","Section 20 is exhaustive of the law relating to Thediathetam was rejected by Chief Justice"
"","Sharvananda, for the following reasons, at pages 22 and 23:"
"a)","Section  20,  as 
introduced 
in  1911, 
is  declaratory  of 
the  customary 
law  of"
"","Thesawalamai  and  it  enacts  in  statutory  language  the  fundamental  concept  of"
"","Thesawalamai that Thediathetam of each spouse shall be property common to the"
"","spouses and both shall be equally entitled thereto."
"b)","The  provisions  of  the  old  section  20  are  not  inconsistent  with  any  provisions  of"
"","Thesawalamai and does not change or alter the incidents attaching to Thediathetam"
"","as found in the Thesawalamai. Section 40 of the Ordinance therefore does not apply,"
"","as Section 20 only re-states the customary law relating to Thediathetam, and the"
"","provisions of the Thesawalamai as are not inconsistent with the provisions of the"
"","Ordinance survive to supplement the latter."
"c)","That  part  of  the  customary  law  of  Thesawalamai  dealing  with  the  incidents  of"
"","Thediathetam  are  not  affected  by  the  repeal  of  old  Section  20  and  the  repeal  of"
"","Section  20  does  not  have 
the  effect  of  obliterating 
the  customary 
law  of"
"","Thesawalamai."
"d)","As the customary law survives the repeal of the declaratory provision, the incidents"
"","of  Thediathetam  referred  to 
in  the  old  Section  20  continue  to  attach  to  the"
"","Thediathetam as defined by the new section 19."
