"acquiring spouse only owns one half of Thediathetam property."
"T
he applicability of Section 19 was considered in  Nalliah v Ponnamah [22 NLR 198]. In"
"that case, the husband, after the death of his wife in 1917 and the death of their only"
"child in 1918, sought to administer his wife’s estate. The husband sought to deduct from"
"the  estate,  certain  sums  of  monies  on  the  basis  that  such  monies  formed  part  of  his"
"mudusam. The husband’s position was that before his marriage he had considerable sums"
"of money saved out of his professional earnings, and after his marriage he invested these"
"moneys  and  other  moneys  subsequently  acquired  in  bonds  and  promissory  notes.  He"
"contended that so much of the money invested as belonged to him before the marriage"
"is  his  separate  property,  and  need  not,  therefore,  be  brought  into  the  testamentary"
"account. The respondent, who was his mother-in-law, objected to the final account being"
"accepted inter alia on the basis that the husband is not entitled to any deductions and"
"that  all  these  investments  must  be  regarded  as  Thediathetam  of  both  spouses  as  the"
"investment was made during the marriage, and that half of such investments should be"
"included in the deceased's estate."
