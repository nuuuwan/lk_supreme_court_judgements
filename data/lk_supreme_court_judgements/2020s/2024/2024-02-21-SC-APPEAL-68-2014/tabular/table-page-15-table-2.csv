"he fact that mudusam property connotes hereditary property is evident from Section 1"
"of Part I of the Thesawalamai Code, which reads as follows:"
"“From ancient times all the goods brought together in marriage by such husband"
"and  wife  have  from  the  beginning  been  distinguished  by  the  denomination  of"
"modesium, or hereditary property, when brought by the husband, and when brought"
"by the wife were denominated in the Tamil language chidenam, or by us dowry; the"
"profits during marriage are denominated tediatêtam, or acquisition. On the death"
"of the father all the goods brought in marriage by him should be inherited by the son"
"or sons, and when a daughter or daughters married they should each receive dowry,"
"or chidenam, from their mother’s property, so that invariably the husband’s property"
"always remains with the male heirs, and the wife’s property with the female heirs,"
"but the acquisition or tediatêtam  should be divided among the sons and daughters"
"alike; the sons, however, must always permit that any increase thereto should fall to"
