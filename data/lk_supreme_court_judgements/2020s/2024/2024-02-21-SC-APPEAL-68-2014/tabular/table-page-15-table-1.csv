s pointed out by Justice Dr. H.W. Tambiah, QC, in The Laws and Customs of the Tamils"

"Later, the right of a married woman to own her property separately was recognized and"
"her  separate  property  was  called  stridhana.  The  Thesawalamai  distinguished  between"
"hereditary property brought by the husband or wife (mudusam), dowry property brought"
"by the wife (chidenam), and property acquired by the husband and wife (thediathetam)."
