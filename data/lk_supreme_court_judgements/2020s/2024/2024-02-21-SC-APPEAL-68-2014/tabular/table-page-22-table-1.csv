"hief Justice Bertram, at pages 100 and 101, held as follows:"
"“The Tesawalamai  Code was  compiled  at an age when  the people of  Jaffna,  who"
"were more or less agriculturists, were residing, both in fact and in law, in Jaffna and"
"were “inhabitants” of Jaffna. Times changed, means of communication with other"
"parts of the world became possible, and these “inhabitants” went to several parts of"
"Ceylon and also to distant countries, but still maintained their relationships with their"
"home, and constructively continued to be “inhabitants” of Jaffna and governed by"
"the Code of Tesawalamai."
