"","he word Thesawalamai means the ‘customs of the land’. As pointed out by Justice H.W."
"Tambiah, QC, in Principles of Ceylon Law [H.W. Cave & Company; 1972] at page 199:",""
"","“Thesawalamai  is  a  special  system  of  law  applicable  to  the  Tamil  inhabitants  of"
"","Jaffna. It appears to have evolved from a system of customary laws applicable to the"
"ancient  Tamils,  who  had  a  matriarchal  system  of  society.  The","first  wave  of"
"","emigration brought the Tamils from the Malabar District of India, and they brought"
"","with  them the  customary  usages peculiar to a  society  based  on  matriarchy. Later"
"","emigrations  brought  an  influx  of  Tamils  from  South  India,  whose  customs  and"
"","manners were influenced by the Aryan system of society and Hindu law. While they"
"","brought certain customary laws specially suited to a patriarchal system of society, at"
"","some point of time a compromise appears to have been effected and therefore we"
"","find in Thesawalamai rules peculiar to a matriarchal system of society blended with"
"rules based on a patriarchal pattern.”",""
