"parents’ Thediathetam but remained his separate property.”"
"A
ny  such presumption  that  may  have existed  under  the Thesawalamai Code  has  been"
"superseded  by  the  developments  that  have  been  referred  to  in  Nalliah  v  Ponnamah"
"[supra].  While  the  argument of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel for  the Appellant  may"
"have succeeded pursuant to the judgment in  Avitchy Chettiar v Rasamma [supra], the"
"new definition of Thediathetam introduced  by the Amendment in  1947, read together"
"with Sections 6 and 7, as amended, have replaced the customary position that prevailed"
"under the Code and has put  to rest the issue as to what comprises Thediathetam and"
"thereby the fact that there exists no presumption that a property is Thediathetam merely"
"for the reason that it was purchased during a marriage for valuable consideration. I am"
"therefore unable to agree with the submission of the learned President’s Counsel for the"
"Appellant that there exists a presumption that all property acquired during a marriage for"
"valuable consideration is Thediathetam."
