"most relevant to the present question and determine the rights of husband and wife"
"to  property  acquired  before  marriage are  those  contained  in  sections  [6]  and [7],"
"which declare such property to belong to the man or woman, as the case may be, for"
"his or her separate estate. I think, therefore, that the money which the husband had"
"saved out of his earnings before his marriage belonged to him for his separate estate,"
"whether it is strictly called mudusom or not. The circumstance that it was invested"
"during marriage does not change its character. Even if he invested it in the purchase"
"of  property  during  marriage  and  not  on  mere  loans,  I  think  that  in  view  of  the"
"principle of the decisions on this point, the property would receive the character of"
"the money invested, and would not be regarded as thediathetam. This is much more"
"the case when the investments take, as in this instance, the shape of loans of money"
"on bonds or other instruments.‚Äù [emphasis added]"
