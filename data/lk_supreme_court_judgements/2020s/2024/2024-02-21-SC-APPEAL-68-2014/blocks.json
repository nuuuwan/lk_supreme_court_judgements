Leave to appeal had however been granted only on the above three questions. The core issue arising from the above questions of law is on whom lies the burden of proof in establishing that a particular property is Thediathetam property. This Court in Manikkavasagar vs Kandasamy and Others [supra] has considered the question of burden of proof in connection with Thediathetam in detail. However, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant has sought to assail the said decision on the basis that it is per incuriam, and also on the basis that the peculiar circumstances of this case, where the dispute with regard to the nature of the property is not between spouses, but third parties, would render the dicta in the said case inapplicable to the present facts. In order to address the several arguments of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant, and in view of the changes that have occurred to the law relating to Thesawalamai and in particular to Thediathetam through legislative interventions and judicial interpretations, it is necessary to first consider the following matters: 1) Thesawalamai and its evolution.",

    "text": "the party who claims it to be so; (b) I am in agreement with the finding that has been arrived at by the learned Judges of the High Court on this issue. Has the Appellant discharged the burden of proof? The next issue that I must consider is whether the Appellant has discharged the burden of proof cast on him by law. In the application made under Section 241, the Appellant claimed that Shanmuganathan, who had been known to him for a long time, is a Chartered Accountant by profession and was engaged in property development, while his wife, Renukadevi was not employed and was a housewife. He had submitted further that the property that was seized in execution of the decree was purchased by the judgment-debtor with his own money although the deeds of transfer were executed in favour of his wife. This position was echoed in his evidence before the District Court, with the Appellant stating that it is Shanmuganathan who has financed the purchase of the said property, although purchased in the name of Renukadevi. The Appellant however has not presented any material to substantiate this position. The two deeds by which Renukadevi purchased the said property does not specify the source of the consideration for such purchase. It was the evidence of the 1st Respondent that the land was purchased from Renukadevi and that Shanmuganathan too had signed the deed. In cross examination, it had been suggested that the land belonged to Renukadevi and her husband in equal share but that suggestion has been denied. The Respondents had led the evidence of the Attorney-at-Law who attested Deed No. 2326 by which the Respondents had purchased the said property, but no useful evidence has been elicited during cross examination to support the position of the Appellant. Taking into consideration the totality of this evidence, I am of the view that the Appellant has failed to present any material to establish that the property that was seized in execution of the decree is Thediathetam and has therefore failed to discharge the burden of proof cast on him.",

The necessity to consider this argument does not arise in view of the conclusion I have reached that the Appellant has failed to establish that the said property is Thediathetam. Conclusion Taking into consideration all of the above, I answer the three questions of law as follows: 1) Have the learned High Court Judges erred in law in coming to a finding that the person claiming that certain property is Thediathetam property should establish his stance? No.",
