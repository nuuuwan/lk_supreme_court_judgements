"116)","As  regards  category  ‘iv’,  this  Court  accepts  the  submission  made  by  learned"
"","President’s Counsel Mr. Saliya Pieris, that since it is evident that the 13th Respondent"
"","– I.G.S. Premathilake is a miscreant of the highest order who had leaked 3 questions"
"","of Paper I of the examination paper, and since he was privy to the full extent of the"
"","finalised  Examination  Paper  I,  there  is  a  ‘possibility’  in  his  having  leaked  further"
"","questions.  I  must  observe  that  it  is  a  well-founded  suspicion.  An  unscrupulous"
"","individual who leaked 3 questions, could have (should he have had the opportunity)"
"","leaked  other  questions  as  well.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  note  that,  unlike  the"
"","questions he himself drafted, he did not have access in written / typed form to the"
"","questions contributed by the other paper setters. (According to the Solicitor General,"
"","paper setters are not permitted to take their mobile phones into the room inside which"
"","deliberations  take  place  and  the  question  paper  is  finalised.  Furthermore,  paper"
"","setters are not permitted to copy down the finalised questions included in the settled"
"","question  paper.)  Furthermore,  there  is  no  evidence  before  this  Court  that  the  13th"
"","Respondent  -  I.G.S.  Premathilake  leaked  any  of  the  questions  which  were  in  the"
"","finalised Question Paper I  which were not originally  drafted by him.  Furthermore,"
"","from the investigation conducted by the CID, it appears inferentially that, what the"
"","13th  Respondent  had  done  was  to  have  passed  on  to  a  third  party  (probably  to  6th"
"","Respondent  in  SC/FR  291/2024  -  Chaminda  Kumara  Ilangasekara)  all  7  questions"
"","which he himself drafted for inclusion in Paper I. That is evident by all 7 questions"
"","(including the 3 that were selected for inclusion in Paper I) being incorporated into"
"","the ‘model examination paper’ containing handwritten endorsements by Chaminda"
"","Kumara Ilangasekara and shared among certain student candidates via a WhatsApp"
"","group. Furthermore, the criminal investigation conducted by the CID  thus far does"
"not","reveal 
the 
compromising 
of 
any 
additional 
questions. 
Therefore, 
that"
"","Premathilake leaked other questions too remains a ‘suspicion’ as opposed to a ‘proven"
"","or admitted fact’ (unlike the leak of the questions falling within category ‘i’). In the"
"","circumstances,  it  is  the  finding  of  this  Court  that  the  allegation  that  certain  other"
"","questions contained in Part I of the Question Paper had been leaked remains only as"
"","a ground of ‘reasonable suspicion’ and a ‘possibility’, and not a ‘proven or admitted"
"","fact’  based  upon  which  this  Court  could  engage  in  the  adjudication  of  the  matter"
"","presented to this Court. In these circumstances, this Judgment also proceeds on the"
"","footing that category ‘iv’ above does not amount to a breach in the integrity of Part I"
"","of the Scholarship Examination Paper."
