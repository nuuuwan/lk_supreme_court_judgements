"","Solution adopted by the authorities and its effect –"
"80) President’s Counsel Mr. Saliya Pieris submitted that, due to the following reasons, the",""
"","solution of granting free marks for the 3 questions that had admittedly been leaked"
"was arbitrary, irrational, and unlawful:",""
"i.","The compromising of the integrity of the Examination was not limited to three"
"","questions, as even the Report of the expert committee  (“P12”) notes that the"
"","leaking of question No. 32 of Part I cannot be ruled out."
"ii.","That the 13th Respondent had access to the entirety of the finalised examination"
"","paper, reveals clearly that he had the opportunity of leaking the other questions"
"","in the finalised question Paper I, as well."
"iii.","In  view  of  the  afore-stated  two  factors,  the  breach  of  the  integrity  of  the"
"","examination paper was a ‘severe security breach’, which according to EST and"
"","Pearson VUE standards (considered by the panel of Deputy Commissioners)"
"","require re-administration of the Examination."
"iv.","The impact of the leak of even 3 questions amounts to a 7.5% of the total marks"
"","for Paper I, which in the circumstances of this Examination is crucial."
"v.","The solution of awarding full marks for three questions was discriminatory of"
"","the student candidates who did not benefit from the leak of the 3 questions and"
"","is  not  reflective  of  the  actual  performance  of  candidates  in  answering  the  3"
"","questions in issue (both those who had honestly and correctly answered one or"
"","more of the questions in issue, and those who had not correctly answered any"
"","of those questions)."
"vi.","The  solution  has  an  adverse 
impact  on 
the  competitive  nature  of 
this"
"","Examination."
