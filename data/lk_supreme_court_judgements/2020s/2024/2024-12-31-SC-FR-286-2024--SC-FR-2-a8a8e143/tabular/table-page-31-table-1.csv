"63) President’s  Counsel  Mr.  Saliya  Pieris  submitted  vehemently","that, 
though 
the"
"","authorities had proceeded on the footing that ‘only’ 3 questions had leaked, in actual"
"","fact it is probable that many more questions had leaked. He also submitted that many"

"","students  who  had  received  the  said  paper  to  correctly  answer  questions  in  the"
