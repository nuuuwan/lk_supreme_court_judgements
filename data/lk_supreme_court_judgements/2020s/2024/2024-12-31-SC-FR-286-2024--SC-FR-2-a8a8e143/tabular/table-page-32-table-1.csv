"examination paper and the decision to award full marks for the leaked questions is"
"unlawful."
"65) President’s  Counsel  Mr.  Sanjeewa 
Jayawardana 
submitted 
that 
the  material"
"submitted to Court by the Respondents supplemented the material placed before this"
"Court by the Petitioners. The composite effect of the material has resulted in it being"
"proven  beyond  doubt that  at the  bare  minimum  3  questions  contained  in  question"
"Paper  I  had  been  compromised.  Thus,  he  submitted  that,  there  was  a  grievous"
"infringement of Article 12(1) occasioned by a breach of the Rule of law."
"66) Mr. Jayawardana submitted that, the fundamental rights of the Petitioners have been"
"violated  since,  (a)  Question  Paper  I  has  been  grievously  tainted  due  to  the  leak  of"
"questions, 
(b) 
the 
integrity  of 
the 
examination  has  been 
compromised  and"
"undermined,  (c)  societal  confidence  in  the  examination  system  has  been  totally"
"eroded, and (d) the trust and faith of student candidates and stakeholder public has"
"eroded due to the absence of confidence that the performance of candidates would be"
"assessed honestly, accurately and objectively."
"67) Mr. Jayawardena submitted that Article 12(1) had been violated manifold, due to (a)"
"the  violation  of  the  Rule  of  law,  (b)  discrimination  (as  only  some  of  the  student"
"candidates had benefitted from the ‘leak’), (c) violation of the public trust doctrine,"
"and (d) breach of the legitimate expectation of student candidates that they would be"
"required to sit for an examination which meets with a high standard of integrity."
"68) Learned President’s Counsel also submitted that, as the learned Solicitor General had"
"conceded 
that 
the  13th  Respondent  had 
leaked  3  questions  of  Part  I, 
that 
the"
"Examination had been compromised was beyond debate. He further submitted that"
"the suspicion that more than 3 questions contained in Part I of the Examination had"
"been  compromised  due  to  further  leaks,  was  not  an 
ill-founded.  He  expressed"
"agreement  with the submission of Mr. Peiris that,  this well-founded suspicion was"
"primarily due to the 13th Respondent having been privy to the totality of the questions"
"included in the finalised Paper I."
"69) Mr. Jayawardana exhibiting his eloquent use of the English language, submitted that"
"“… the tragedy of such a leakage, is that children who have one solitary opportunity, through"
"excelling at the Grade 5 scholarship exam, at which, a mere one mark difference, can mean,"
"denial of a much cherished change to be admitted to better equipped public schools with the"
