"117)","In view of the foregoing, this Judgment will proceed on the footing that the leak"
"","of questions of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination was confined to the three (3)"
"","questions of Part I of the Scholarship Examination Paper which fall within category"
"‘i’ listed above.",""
"118)","A careful consideration of the provisions of the Public Examinations Act, No. 25"
"","of 1968 as amended by Law No. 15 of 1976 reveals so evidently that this law which"
"","governs  the  conduct  of  all  ‘public  examinations’  conducted  by  the  Department  of"
"Examinations  under","the 
stewardship  of 
the  Commissioner  of  Examinations"
"","(Commissioner  General  of  Examinations)  is  founded  upon  the  compelling  need  to"
"","ensure  the  integrity  of  all  such  examinations.  All  provisions  of  this  law  have  been"
"","drafted so as to optimally ensure that public examinations are conducted to a high"
"","standard of integrity, by which the law presupposes that there would be fairness and"
"","equal  opportunity  provided  to  all  candidates  to  face  the  examination  and  sit  and"
"compete on an equal footing.",""
"119)","Conduct  that  has  been  prohibited  in  terms  of  this  law  has  been  classified  as"
"","‘offences’.  Such  prohibitions  have  been  designed  to  ensure  that  the  contents  of"
"","examination  papers  once  settled  (finalised)  remains  secret  up  until  the  lapse  of  30"
"","minutes  following  the  commencement  of  the  examination,  and  are  also  aimed  at"
"","ensuring a high standard of integrity among officials and candidates. While there is"
"","no evidence regarding the date and time on which question paper I was finalised and"
"","thus ‘set’, it is clear that the end of this time period occurred on 15th September 2024"
"","at 11.45 a.m. (i.e. 30 minutes after question Paper I commenced at 11.15 a.m.). During"
"","this  interim  period,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Act,  the  settled  examination  paper  is"
"","classified as a ‘secret document’ [vide section 6(1)], and any person who fraudulently"
"","or  dishonestly  delivers  a  secret  document  or  part  thereof,  or  communicates  any"
"","information relating to the contents of a secret document or part thereof, to any other"
"","person who is not a person to whom he is authorised to deliver such document or"
"","communicate such information, shall be guilty of an offence [vide section 6(2)]."
"1
20)","In these circumstances, a general proposition of law that must be recognised is that"
"","the  maintenance  of  the  integrity  of  a  public  examination  is  a  mandatory  legal"
"","requirement  and  is  a  sine-qua-non  of  any  public  examination  conducted  in  this"
"","country. A breach of such integrity would be a derogation from this imperative legal"
"","standard  enshrined  in  the  governing  law.  Additionally,  such  a  standard  is  also"
"","recognisable from the general principles of law applicable to any public examination."
