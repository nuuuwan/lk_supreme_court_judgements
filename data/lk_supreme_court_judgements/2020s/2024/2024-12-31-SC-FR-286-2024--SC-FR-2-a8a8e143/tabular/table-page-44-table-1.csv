"iii.","By  the  identified  solution,  two  distinct  categories  of  student  candidates  (i.e."
"","those  who  benefitted  from  the  leak  and  those  who  did  not  benefit  from  the"
"","leaked questions) have been ‘clubbed together’, is therefore discriminatory and"
"","thus, the fundamental right to equality has been breached."
"iv.","The award of  full  marks for the 3 questions  is not a  ‘fair solution’  as, in the"
"","instant  situation  every  mark  is  of  critical  importance,  whereas  through  the"
"","identified  solution  all  students 
irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  have"
"","benefitted  from  the  leaked  model  questions  and  independent  of  their  own"
"","performance is to receive 7.5 marks."
"v.","None of the committees appointed to consider the matter had addressed their"
"","mind to the fact that the 13th Respondent who leaked a minimum of 3 questions"
"","had  access  to  all  the  finalised  questions,  and  thus,  there  was  a  distinct"
"","possibility of all questions in the finalised question paper having been leaked."
"","The identified solution does not take into account that eventuality."
"vi.","“R7” indicates that conducting the entire examination afresh is the only viable"
"","solution."
