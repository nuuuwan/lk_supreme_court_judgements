to 
the  extent  of 
inviting  Court 
to 
treat 
the 
‘limited"
"","objections’, filed on behalf of the Respondents and the ‘limited counter affidavits’ filed"
"","on behalf of the Petitioners together with the material originally tendered to Court by"
"","the Petitioners as amounting to the full and final pleadings relating to these cases."
"4)  When these Applications were supported on 18th November 2024, the Court having",""
"","considered the material presented by the Petitioners, and the submissions of learned"
"","counsel for the Petitioners and the Respondents, granted Leave to Proceed in favor of"

"","giving  rise  to  a  provisional  finding  reached  by  Court  that  Article  12(1)  of  the"
"","Constitution had been infringed by the impugned decisions and actions referred to"

interim  order"
"","preventing  the  implementation  of  a  decision  made  by  one  or  more  Respondents"
