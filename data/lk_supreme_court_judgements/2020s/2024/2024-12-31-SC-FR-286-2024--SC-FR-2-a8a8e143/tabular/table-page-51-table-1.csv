"121) 
Admittedly, at the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination held on 15th September 2024,"
"the afore-stated legal standard had been violated. The circumstances under which the"
"breach  in  the  requisite  standard  of  integrity  occurred  does  not  serve  as  an  excuse"
"recognised by law for the violation. Therefore, this Court concludes that due to the"
"compromising  of  three  questions  of  Part  I  of  the  examination  occasioned  by  the"
"the  Grade  5  Scholarship 
criminal  conduct  of 
I.G.S.  Premathilake,  Paper  I  of"
"Examination  held  on  15th  September  2024  had  been  conducted  in  a  manner  that"
"violates the law. A violation of the law is an insult on the Rule of law. It is trite law"
"that a violation of the Rule of law violates the principle of equality and thus infringes"
"the  fundamental  right  to  equality  guaranteed  by  Article  12  of  the  Constitution."
"Therefore, this Court concludes that, by the breach of the integrity (confidentiality"
"being  compromised  by  a  leak)  of  three  (3)  questions  of  Part  I  of  the  Grade  5"
"Scholarship  Examination  occasioned  by 
the 
criminal 
conduct  of 
the 
13th"
"Respondent - I.G.S. Premathilake and the 6th Respondent in SC/ FR 291/ 2024 and"
"the  9th  Respondent  in  SC/  FR  294/  2024  -  Chaminda  Kumara  Ilangasekara,  the"
"fundamental right to equality and the protection of the Rule of law guaranteed by"
"Article  12(1)  of 
the  Constitution  had  been 
infringed.  The  victims  of  such"
"infringement were the student candidates who sat for the afore-stated examination"
"and  did  not  benefit  from  the  afore-stated  ‘leak’  and  constitutes  a  segment  of"
"children  who  were 
thereby  accorded  differential 
treatment  against 
the 
law."
"Nevertheless, in the present case, the student candidates who did not receive the"
"benefit of the ‘leak’ were not founded upon reasonable classification as permitted"
"by the principle of equality, but were accorded differential treatment as a violation"
"of the rule of law. This has resulted in an infringement of the right to equality of"
"such candidates. Therefore, this Court also concludes that the student candidates"
"among 
the  Petitioners  who  have 
claimed 
(without 
serious 
contest  by 
the"
"Respondents) not to have been privy to the compromised Examination Paper I and"
"thus did not benefit from the leak, were among the large number of child victims"
"of such infringement."
