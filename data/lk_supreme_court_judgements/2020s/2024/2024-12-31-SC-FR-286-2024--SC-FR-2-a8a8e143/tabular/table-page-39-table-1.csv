"88) President’s Counsel Mr. Saliya Pieris submitted that since the breach in the integrity","",""
"","of Examination Paper I was severe, the only lawful and reasonable solution would be",""
"","to conduct the Examination (Paper I) afresh. He submitted that, though having to face",""
"","the examination afresh would cause some amount of psychological trauma to student",""
"","candidates, that would be far less traumatic than the long-term feeling that injustice",""
"","had  been  perpetrated  to  innocent  and  honest  students.  He  said  that  such  students",""

from 
injustice  occasioned
