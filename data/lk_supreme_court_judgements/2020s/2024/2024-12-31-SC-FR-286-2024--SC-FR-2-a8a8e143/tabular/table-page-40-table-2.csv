"","following as being reasons as to why this Court should not direct the conduct of a"
"fresh examination:",""
"i.","The 
preparation, 
vetting, 
finalisation, 
administration 
and 
the  marking,"
"","computation  and  the  release  of  results  of  Paper  I  would  require  a  considerable"
"","period of time and would result in considerable delay. This would in turn result"
"","in the entire school system being adversely affected by the delay in the release of"
"","the  results  and  would  also  have  a  ‘domino  effect’  on  the  conduct of  all  the other"
"","school and other public examinations. This will in turn contribute towards further"
"","delay occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis of 2022."
"ii.","There  are  3,968  primary  schools  in  Sri  Lanka  which  comprise  of  grades  1  to  5"
"","(only).  Should  the  2024  Scholarship  Examination  be  re-administered,  it  would"
"","result in students of these schools being deprived of grade 6 education for several"
"","months."
"iii.","Re-administration  of  the  Examination  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the"
"","conduct of co-curricular activities."
"iv.","Having 
to  prepare 
(be 
trained  and 
study)  afresh 
for  Paper 
I  will  cause"
"","inconvenience and psychological trauma to the students."
