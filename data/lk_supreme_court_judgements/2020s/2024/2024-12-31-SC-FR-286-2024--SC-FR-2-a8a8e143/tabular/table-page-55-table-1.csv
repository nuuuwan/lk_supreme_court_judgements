"eyes of the law. A classification, which is (a) not arbitrary, (b) is reasonable, and (c) is"
"otherwise lawful, can be regarded as being valid and permissible and as not violating"
"the  fundamental  right  to  equality.  That  would  be  if  such  classification  is  founded"
"upon  intelligible  and  reasonable  differentia  aimed  at  facilitating  the  purpose  for"
"which the power has been conferred and is to be exercised. Furthermore, there should"
"be a reasonable and rational nexus between the purpose (object) that is sought to be"
"achieved and the basis of the classification."
