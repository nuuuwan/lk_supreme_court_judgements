"","learned  Solicitor  General  that  questions  Nos.  1,  20,  21,  and  32  are  significantly"
"","dissimilar to questions Nos. 15, 14, 13 and 11 & 12 of the ‘model examination paper’"
"","referred  to  above,  this  Court  also  had  the  benefit  of  examining  the  two  sets  of"
"","questions based on a side-by-side comparison and a studying of their content. It is"
"","necessary to place on record that this Court could not observe any striking similarity"
"","in the four pairs of questions claimed by the Petitioners, as having the possibility of"
"","being leaked. Thus, there was no basis for this Court to have taken judicial notice of"
"","the alleged breach in integrity of the questions falling into this category.  Therefore,"
"","this Judgment proceeds on the footing that category ‘ii’ above does not amount to a"
"","breach in the integrity of Part I of the Scholarship Examination Paper."
