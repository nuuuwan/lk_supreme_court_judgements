"to participate in the decision-making process or influence thereon. In fact, in addition"
"to general administrative superintendence, this Court observes that in terms of Article"
"52(2) of the Constitution, the Secretary to the Ministry has, subject to the direction and"
"control  of  her  Minister,  the  power  to  exercise  supervision  over  the  departments  of"
"government or other institutions in-charge of her Minister. However, it is important"
"to note that as conceded by the learned Solicitor General, the Public Examinations Act"
"does not empower the Minister to provide either general or case specific directions to"
"the Commissioner of Examinations. In the circumstances, it is the view of this Court"
"that both the provisions of the Constitution as well as the provisions of the Public"
"Examinations Act would not empower either the Minister or the Secretary to the"
"Ministry  to  participate  in  the  decision-making  process,  issue  directions  to  the"
"Commissioner of Examinations, assume to themselves the decision-making power,"
"or influence the process in a manner that would take away, curtail or inhibit the"
"discretionary authority vested in the Commissioner of Examinations by the Public"
"Examinations Act. This does not mean that the public functionary cannot engage in"
"a process of consultation with the Minister or the Secretary, subject to the important"
"caveat that the final decision must always be that of the public functionary who is"
"required by law to take such decision."
