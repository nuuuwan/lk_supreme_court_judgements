"152) 
As  regards  the  non-recording  (non-documentation)  of the  impugned  purported"
"decision  of  the  Commissioner  General  of  Examinations  and  possible 
inferences"
"arising  thereof,  I  must  hasten  to  add  that,  a  study  of  the  post-1978  era  judicial"
"precedence of this Court and also those of the Court of Appeal, clearly reveal that,"
"without exception, this Court has in the course of exercising judicial review, refused"
"to judicially endorse impugned decisions of public functionaries, which have not been"
"contemporaneously recorded in the official file. A contemporaneous recording of a"
"decision by a public functionary is possibly the only reliable evidence there could be"
"to prove that such a decision in fact does exist, and was taken at or about the time"
"such decision is said to have been taken and under the circumstances that prevailed"
"at that time. Endorsing a decision which has not been contemporaneously recorded"
"by the decision-maker (as in this case), can be extremely dangerous, and can give rise"
"to multi-faceted repercussions, which would not be in consonance  with the Rule of"
"Law and would also not be in the public interest.  However, it is necessary to recognise"
"that  there  can  be  certain  instances  where  exigencies  of  the  situation  may  have"
"prevented  the  decision  maker  from  promptly  recording  the  decision.  Furthermore,"
"the existence of such a decision may be apparent where it has been incorporated into"
"a succeeding decision. However, it is noteworthy that in this instance none of those"
"exceptions apply and the CGE has failed to adduce any valid reason for not having"
"recorded his purported decision."
