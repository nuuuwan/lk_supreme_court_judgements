"105)","The learned Solicitor General submitted that the CGE had in fact taken a decision"
"","and the absence of a written decision on the day it was taken cannot now be made an"
"","issue by the Petitioners, when in fact they made no such complaint in their Petitions."
"","He further submitted that while the Public Examinations Act bestows powers on the"
"","Commissioner  of  Examinations  to  take  such  decisions,  the  Minister  of  Education"
"","clearly has overall ‘superintendence’ over the manner in which the provisions of the"
"","Act may be applied. He submitted that the supportive role played by the Honourable"
"","Prime  Minister  /  Minister  of  Education  cannot  be  faulted  and  should  be  in  fact"
"","applauded. The role played by both the Minister of Education and the Secretary to the"
"","Ministry cannot be classified as either ‘intervention’ or ‘usurpation’ of the powers of"
"","the  Commissioner  of  Examinations.  Their  role  he  submitted  ‘complemented’  the"
"","efforts of the Commissioner of Examinations."
