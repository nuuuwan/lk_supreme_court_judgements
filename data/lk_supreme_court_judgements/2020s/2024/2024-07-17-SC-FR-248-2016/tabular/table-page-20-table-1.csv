"informed or they were unaware is not
justifiable as three years had passed since the introduction"
"of the new SoR."
"The maxim; “Equity aids
the vigilant and not
the indolent” which means
that delay defeats"
"equity. Equity requires those who wish to seek its redress to move quickly in acting upon the"
"same. Lord Camden,
in Smith v Clay [1767] 29 ER 743 held that “Equity has always refused"
"its aids to stale demands where a party has slept his rights for a great
length of
time. Nothing"
"can call
forth this court
into activity but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence where"
"these are wanting the court is passive and does nothing.”"
"The Petitioners
slept on their
rights for
three years.
It
is reasonable to assume that
they were"
"aware of
the SoR or
should have taken steps to become aware of
the new SoR when it was"
"introduced. A delay of three years is unreasonable and unjust. I am of the view that at least one"
"of the 86 Petitioners named in this application was aware of the new SoR."
"It is the view of this court that the Petitioners have not come to court on time and therefore on the"
"basis of the aforesaid findings, the Application is dismissed."
