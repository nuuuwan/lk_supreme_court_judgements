"Sathya Hettige P.C.J in Liyanage & Another v Ratnasiri - Divisional Secretary, Gampaha"
"& Others [2013] 1 SRI L.R 10 held “It must be stated that the Supreme Court has consistently"
"held in a number of cases involving alleged violation of
fundamental rights that
the time limit"
"within which an application for relief
for any fundamental right or language right violation may"
"be filed is mandatory and must be complied”"
"In the case of Edirisuriya v Navaratnam and Others [1985] 1 SRI L.R 101, Ranasinghe, J"
"held “The time limit of one month set out
in Article 126(20 of the Constitution is mandatory. Yet"
"in
a fit case the Court would entertain an application made outside the limit of one month"
"provided an adequate excuse for the delay could be adduced.”"
"The case of Siriwardene v Rodrigo [1986] 1 SLR 384 states as follows;"
"“An application for infringement
for right of equality must be filed within one month of the date"
"from the date of
the commission of the administrative act which alleged, constitutes infringement"
"only on a later date, the one month would run from that later date.”"
"It
is important
to understand when the alleged violation took place. The reason for the alleged"
"violation
of
the Petitioners
rights
is
the
introduction of
the SoR that disentitled them from"
"applying for
the post of Assistant Director at
the Department. The SoR came into effect on"
"11.01.2013 and applications for the post of Assistant Director were notified on 30.06.2016 by a"
"circular addressed to all Heads of Units. The Petitioners’ position is that they were not informed"
"about
the new SoR and hence could not have known about the new SoR. The purported violation"
"of
the Petitioners’ Fundamental Rights would have happened the moment
the new SoR was"
"introduced, not when they were notified about the applications for the post of Assistant Director."
"It is necessary to state that I am not inclined to favour the Petitioners who observed that there had"
"been a new SoR after
three years of introducing one. The Petitioners only came forward when"
"they were not qualified under the new SoR for the position of Assistant Director. Which means"
"they
only
came
forward when
the
new SoR worked
against
them, when they could
have"
"challenged the SoR when it was
first
introduced instead. Their position that
they were not"
