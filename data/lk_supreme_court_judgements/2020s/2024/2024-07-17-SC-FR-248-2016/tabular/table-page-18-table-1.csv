"The Establishment Code - Volume II
- Chapter
II
- Clause 2:2 states “Every draft Scheme of"
"Recruitment should be forwarded in triplicate by the Secretary to the Ministry to the Director of"
"Establishments.”"
"Clause 2:3
states
“The Director of Establishments will approve the Scheme subject
to such"
"amendments as may be made in Consultation with the Secretary”"
"The new Scheme of Recruitment came into effect on 11.01.2013. According to the new Scheme"
"of Recruitment
(document marked P6)
the Director General of
the Department of Archeology"
"has approved the Scheme of Recruitment with his signature. Which means that the new SoR is in"
"line with the Establishment Code."
"In
any event, as per
the SoR marked P6 and the notice calling for applications marked P4,"
"officers who belong to the category of MN-
05 and MN- 07 are eligible to apply for the post of"
"Assistant Director. The Petitioners belong to the scale MN 4 and this fact has been maintained by"
"the
Petitioners
throughout
the
course
of
this
application. Therefore,
the
next
salary
step"
"applicable to the Petitioners would be the scale MN 5. The Petitioners are in MN 4 and therefore"
"the Petitioners are not eligible to apply under P4. I agree with the Respondent’s position that the"
"Petitioners cannot have a legitimate expectation for a career progression within the Department"
"in contravention to the appointment
letter and the applicable schemes of
recruitment and the"
"service minute."
"The Petitioners have maintained that P6 which is the new SoR was not circulated within the"
"Archaeology Department as
instructed by the Public Service Commission and that
they only"
"became aware of
the existence of
the new SoR (P6) after
the post of Assistant Director was"
"advertised. No material has been provided by the Respondents to deny or contradict this position."
"The 13th Respondent, however,
in his affidavit states that SoR in dispute has been published on"
"the web page of the Department of Archaeology."
"Now it is important to assess whether the Application of the Petitioners’ is out of time."
"According to Article 126(2) of the The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of"
"Sri Lanka, “Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right relating"
"to such person has been infringed or
is about
to be infringed by executive or administrative"
"action, he may himself or by an Attorney-at-Law on his behalf, within one month thereof,
