"The Respondents
believe
that
the
application
is
devoid
of
any merit
and
is
based
on
a"
"misconception of the PSC and its restructuring which took place in 2006. The Petitioners appear"
"to have based this application on the status of affairs prior to 2006 which is no longer comparable"
"to the present status."
"The 1st to the 3rd and 6th Respondents alleges the following facts:"
"The SoR was approved by the PSC with the recommendations of
the Line Ministry, Director"
"General of Establishment, Department of Management Services and the National Salaries and"
"Cadre Commission after a very thorough process. The Petitioners did not at any time challenge"
"the SoR when it was introduced. The Respondents state that
the Petitioners cannot be heard to"
"say that they were unaware of the process that resulted in approving the SoR."
"The Respondents
also believe
that
the Petition
and Affidavit
is out
of
time and should be"
"dismissed in limine. Petitioners cannot have a legitimate expectation contrary to the provisions of"
"the SoR and the
recruitments
cannot be made
in
violation of
the SoR and existing policy"
"recruitment. The calling for applications is strictly in terms of the SoR and was with the approval"
"of
the PSC. The day-
to-day functions of
the institution are badly affected by the number of"
"vacancies which are urgently required to be filled."
"The Respondents further states that
the Petitioners cannot be heard to complain on the basis of"
"any stagnation in MN-04 as several promotions within the public service are available to them to"
"seek promotions. Petitioners have been given an opportunity to apply for posts in relation to"
"MN-05 which is the next grade."
"Analysis of the facts"
"One of
the arguments
raised by the 1st
to the 3rd and 6th Respondents and 15th to the 34th"
"Respondents
is
that
the Petitioners did not at any stage challenge the Scheme of Recruitment"
"when it was introduced. They believe that the Petitioners ought to have challenged it at an earlier"
"point of time."
"I will now assess whether the Scheme of Recruitment is in line with the Establishment Code."
