"published in 1999 which was the Scheme of Recruitment
the Petitioners verily believed was in"
"existence at present."
"The Petitioners
thereafter made attempts
to ascertain whether
the said SoR had in fact been"
"amended or replaced. The Petitioners emphatically state that had there been a new amended SoR,"
"they should have been consulted. No such consultation has taken place; had there been any such"
"attempt
to
create
a
new or
amended
SoR,
the
Petitioners would
have
certainly made"
"representations giving their views to ensure that none of the employees of th Department were"
"adversely affected by such a new/amended SoR. No such representations were called or made by"
"any of the Petitioners."
"Thereafter,
the
Petitioners
inquired
from the Additional Director General
of Archaeology"
"whether in fact a new SoR was implemented or whether the existing SoR had been changed. On"
"or about
the 14th of July 2016 the Petitioners were told by the said Additional Director General"
"that a new SoR had been approved. In the discussion it was revealed that a junior officer of the"
"Department had prepared it and it was later approved by the 1st Respondent and finally approved"
"by the Public Service Commission (PSC). The said Additional Director General also informed"
"the Petitioners
that
she had been newly appointed to the said position and that
the new SoR"
"should have been made in consultation with the Petitioners but that since it has nevertheless been"
"approved,
the Department was bound to implement
the new SoR. The said Additional Director"
"General also informed the Petitioners that
if the objective cannot be achieved by the new SoR,"
"the Department may consider changing it
in future. Thereafter
the Petitioners obtained a new"
"copy of the SoR and that was the first time the said SoR was disclosed to the Petitioners."
"The Petitioners state that
the new SoR disentitled the Petitioners from applying for the positions"
"of Assistant Director and above which they were qualified and eligible for under the previous"
"SoR."
"The Petitioners state that
the addition of “5 years experience in MN-05 Grade 01” requirement"
"has disqualified all
the Petitioners from applying for the said positions although the Petitioners"
"were qualified to do so under the old SoR. Petitioners further state that in any event there are no"
"“Grade 01” officers in the MN-05 scale at the Department."
