"of  Gampaha  seeking  a  declaration  of  title  to  the  land  described  in  the"
"second  schedule  to  the  plaint  and  the  ejectment  of  the  defendant"

"addition,  he  sought  a  declaration  of  title  to  the  land  described  in  the"
"schedule to the answer, which is different from the land claimed by the"
