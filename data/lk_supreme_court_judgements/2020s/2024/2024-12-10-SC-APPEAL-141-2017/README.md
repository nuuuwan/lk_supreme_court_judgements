Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District Court

of Gampaha seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the

second schedule to the plaint and the ejectment of the defendant

therefrom. The defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiffs action. In

addition, he sought a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the answer, which is different from the land claimed by the

plaintiff. After trial, the District Court dismissed the claims of both

parties and dismissed the action in its entirety. On appeal by the plaintiff,

the High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha allowed the appeal and

directed the District Court to enter judgment for the plaintiff. The

defendant has now appealed to this Court.

The owner of the land described in the first schedule to the plaint

( ) with an extent of

approximately 2 Acres, was Arnolis Jayakody. The plaintiffs husband

(Edmond Jayakody) and the defendants father (Kularatne Jayakody) are

the sons of Arnolis Jayakody. By Deed No. 20673 dated 21.09.1975,

Arnolis Jayakody gifted an undivided 3 Roods of that land, along with the

house, to Kularatne Jayakody. On the same date, by Deed No. 20674

attested by the same Notary, he gifted an undivided 1 Acre and 1 Rood to

Edmond Jayakody. These facts remain undisputed.

The case for the plaintiff as pleaded in the plaint was that, Edmond

Jayakody, instead of his undivided rights, amicably partitioned a portion

of the land (not the entirety of land comprising the undivided portions of

Edmond Jayakody and Kularatne Jayakody) into 2 lots as Lot 1 and 2,

by Plan No. 487 dated 30.11.1978. Lot 1 was sold to an unidentified party

(neither the Deed number nor the identity of the transferee was

disclosed), while Lot 2 is the land in dispute, which the plaintiff alleges is

being forcibly possessed by the defendant. The plaintiff seeks a

3

SC/APPEAL/141/2017

declaration of title to Lot 2 and the ejectment of the defendant therefrom.

At the trial, it was recorded as an admission that Lot 2 in Plan No. 487 is

the disputed portion of the land.

Plan No. 487 is not an amicable Partition Plan jointly prepared by

Edmond Jayakody and Kularatne Jayakody. The defendant produced

Plan No. 590 dated 21.12.1977 claiming it to be the amicable Partition

Plan, but there is no evidence to accept that position either. If Plan No.

590 was considered as the amicable Partition Plan to end co-ownership

between Edmond Jayakody and Kularatne Jayakody, there would not

have been a reason for Edmond Jayakody to subsequently prepare Plan

No. 487 and assert that Plan No. 487 is the amicable Partition Plan.

The District Judge dismissed the action on the basis that this is a co-

owned land and there is no evidence to conclude that the plaintiff is

exclusively entitled to Lot 2 in Plan No. 487. The District Judge was of

the view that the dispute should be resolved through a partition action.

There was no superimposition of Plan No. 590 (older Plan) on Plan No.

487. The High Court of Civil Appeal did not carefully look at the

discrepancies of the two Plans but considered them as identical whereas

they are not. For instance, the extent of Lots No. 1 and 2 of Plan No. 487

is 1 Acre and 37.2 Perches, whereas Lot No. 3 in Plan No. 590 (which the

High Court thought identical to Lots No. 1 and 2 in Plan No. 487) is only

3 Roods and 17.5 Perches.

The defendant produced Deed No. 22324 dated 03.12.1978 (which the

plaintiff should have produced) as V5. According to schedule 1 of this

Deed, Edmond Jayakody sold 2 Roods and 12 Perches out of the land

described in the first schedule to the plaint, namely

(the larger land of about 2 Acres owned by

Arnolis Jayakody) to Magilin Nona (who is not a party to this case).

4

SC/APPEAL/141/2017

According to schedule 2 of Deed No. 22324, Edmond Jayakody also sold

undivided 68 Perches of a land known as Lot D in

in extent of undivided 3 Roods out of 1 Acre and 6 Perches to

Magilin Nona. In this Deed No. 22324, Edmond Jayakody states that Plan

No. 487 was prepared in amalgamation of those two lands (

and Lot D in ).

It may be recalled that the plaintiff filed this action seeking a declaration

of title to a portion of , not

seeking a declaration of title to both a portion of

and Lot D in .

With this new evidence elicited by the defendant, it is abundantly clear

that Plan No. 487 is not an amicable Partition Plan jointly prepared by

Edmond Jayakody and Kularatne Jayakody for the land described in the

first schedule to the plaint ( ).

Even Edmond Jayakody did not act upon Plan No. 487 as a distinct and

defined portion carved out in lieu of his undivided rights. For instance,

in the Mortgage Bond No. 3802 executed on 27.07.1982 and produced

by the defendant marked V14, Edmond Jayakody mortgaged his

undivided rights which he became entitled to by Deed No. 20674, not Lot

2 in Plan No. 487.

The identification of the land in suit for the purposes of the case and the

proof of title to that specific portion of land are two distinct matters. While

the former pertains to the establishment of the physical boundaries or

location of the disputed land, the latter concerns the establishment of a

legal right or ownership over it.

In view of the afore-mentioned factual situation, following findings of the

High Court cannot be accepted as correct:

5

SC/APPEAL/141/2017

It is therefore clear that it is the lot 2 in P-2 plan No 487; a divided

and defined allotment of land, was the subject matter of this action,

which is a sub divided portion of defined lot 3 in the plan No 590

marked V-1 by the defense. The fact that the two sons of the said

Arnolis Jayakody, the plaintiffs husband and the defendants

father, had got the main land described in the 1st schedule to the

plaint, amicably divided was very well demonstrated by the

production of V-1 plan and the evidence of the defendant and no

objection was raised for same on behalf of the plaintiff. Moreover,

the P-2 plan No 487, which subdivided the lot 3 in V-1 plan No 590,

was marked subject to proof and it stood duly proved by calling the

relevant surveyor K.A.P. Kasthuriratne.

In my view, the High Court erred both in fact and in law when it set aside

the judgment of the District Court.

The District Judge was correct in concluding that the plaintiff failed to

prove sole ownership to Lot 2 in Plan No. 487.

It is important to note that neither the District Court nor the High Court

came to the finding that the plaintiff had prescribed to Lot 2 in Plan No.

487. No such argument was presented before this Court either.

The two questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted are as

follows:

(a) Have the Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges erred in Law

by accepting Plan No. 487 (P2) relied upon by the Plaintiff to

establish that the land in the 1st schedule to the Plaint was

amicably divided between the Plaintiffs husband and the

Defendants father as per the said Plan?

6

SC/APPEAL/141/2017

(b) Whether the Plaintiff had established the burden rested upon her

in Law in a rei vindicatio action for a declaration of title to the land

described in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint?

I answer the first question of law in the affirmative and the second

question of law in the negative. I set aside the judgment of the High Court

and restore the judgment of the District Court. I make no order as to

costs.
