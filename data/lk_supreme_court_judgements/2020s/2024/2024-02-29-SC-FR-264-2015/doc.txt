Facts of the Application

The petitioner stated that he went to Vauniya on the 15th of November, 2014 in his car, along with

Sergeant Buddhika Karunasinghe, to meet with Squadron Leader Sumedha Ritigala. Further, he

reached Vauniya at or around 10.00 p.m. on that day and met with his friends. At or around 1.00

a.m. on the 16th of November, 2014, the petitioner had gone to Vauniya town in his car to purchase

foods and drinks for his friends and he had lost his way on returning to his friends.

The petitioner further stated that at around 1.30 a.m. he was stopped on the road by individuals

dressed in civilian clothes who were armed with T56 weapons. Moreover, the 1st respondent, the

Officer In Charge who was in civilian clothes made inquiries as to who the petitioner was and what

he was doing in that area at that time. Hence, the petitioner produced his identity card and identified

himself as an officer of the Sri Lanka Air Force. He further stated that the said 1st respondent then

made disparaging remarks about the Sri Lanka Air Force and its senior officers, deeply offending

the petitioner who then told him to refrain from making such remarks. Thereafter, the 1st

respondent threatened to kill the petitioner and throw his body into the forest. The 1st respondent

then instructed the other officers present at the scene to conduct a search of the petitioners car.

At or around 2.00 a.m. of the same day, the 2nd Respondent Head Quarters Inspector (hereinafter

referred to as the 2nd respondent) arrived at the scene with approximately 15 officers and verbally

abused the petitioner and the Sri Lanka Air Force in derogatory and profane language Thereafter,

the petitioner was taken to the Irrataperiyakulam Police Station and was instructed to sit in a room.

The petitioner stated that the 3rd respondent entered the room with a document and forced the

petitioner to sign the said document but the petitioner refused to sign it. He was then threatened

with legal action by the said 3rd respondent and the other officers present at the police station. The

petitioner further stated that his request to call his family and/or an Attorney-at-Law was denied

and he was not informed of the reason for his arrest and detention. Further, the petitioner stated

that he was harassed by the officers of the Irrataperiyakulam Police Station during that night.

Further, it was stated that at around 11.30 a.m. on the 16th of November, 2014, the petitioner was

permitted to speak to his wife via telephone, immediately after which he was transferred to the

Vauniya Police Station and detained in a police cell. At the said police station, the petitioner stated

that he was verbally abused by the 2nd respondent who also demanded the petitioner to accept that

4

he had committed some minor offence in order to release him. The petitioner stated that he refused

to admit that he committed an offence, and once again requested for the reasons for his arrest and

detention. Angered by the responses of the petitioner, the 2nd respondent threatened to take legal

action against the petitioner. The petitioner further stated that his wife came to the said police

station, but was only permitted to speak with him very briefly.

Furthermore, the petitioner stated that on the evening of the 16th of November, 2014, around 6.30

p.m., he was produced before the learned Magistrate of Vauniya in Chambers, but was not

permitted to speak with the Magistrate. After they came out of the said chamber, he was informed

that the learned Magistrate remanded him for a week.

The petitioner was then taken to the Vauniya remand prison and detained therein until the 21st of

November, 2014. The petitioner stated that the Vauniya Prison housed several L.T.T.E. cadres and

that the petitioner was later made aware of the fact that the Vauniya Police Station had released a

media statement giving details of the petitioner and his arrest, and it resulted in several inmates

harassing him due to his involvement in the war as a pilot of a fighter jet.

Thereafter, the petitioner was produced before the Vauniya Magistrates Court on the 21st of

November, 2014 and enlarged on bail by the court. Further, on the 30th of January, 2015, the

petitioner was discharged by the learned Magistrate of Vauniya.

In the circumstances, the petitioner stated that the course of conduct culminating in his arrest and

detention and remanding him amounted to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or

punishment and are an infringement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the petitioner by the

Constitution.

Objections filed by the 1st Respondent

The 1st respondent filed objections stating that on the 16th of November 2014, he received

information from a private informant about a car that was said to be roaming in the Galnattakulam

area in a suspicious manner in the early hours of the morning. Hence, he along with a team of

police officers proceeded to the said area and stopped the car which was driven by the petitioner.

Further, when asked about his name, address, where he was travelling and the reasons for

5

travelling, the 1st respondent stated that the petitioner gave varying and inconsistent responses,

thereby failing to reveal his identity properly.

The 1st respondent further stated that, taking into consideration the suspicious conduct of the

petitioner, his inability to disclose his identity and co-operate with law enforcement officials, and

that suspicion that the petitioner was involved in the commission of a cognizable offence, he

arrested the petitioner on the 16th of November, 2014 at 3.05 a.m.

The 1st respondent further stated that thereafter, an A report was filed in the Magistrates Court

of Vauniya and reported the facts pertaining to the matter and the need to conduct further

investigations into the matter and produced the petitioner before the learned Magistrate of Vauniya,

who remanded the petitioner.

Thereafter, the Police had sought the advice of the Attorney General in respect of the said

investigations and having considered all matters, the Attorney General had advised the Police to

discharge the suspect from the case by letter dated 30th June, 2016.

Analysis

Article 13(5) of the Constitution states, inter alia, that every person shall be presumed innocent

until he is proved guilty. Further, Article 13(1) of the Constitution states;

No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by

law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.

[emphasis added]

The procedure applicable for arrest are set out in several laws including section 32 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended. Section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act reads as follows:

Any peace officer may without an order from a Magistrate and

without a warrant arrest any person who has been concerned in

any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable complaint

6

has been made or credible information has been received or a

reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned; a

suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was

founded on matters within the police officers knowledge or on the

statement made by the other persons in a way which justify him

giving them credit.

In the objections filed by the 1st respondent, he stated that he received a credible information that

a car was roaming in his police area in a suspicious manner. Therefore, he along with a team of

police officers proceeded to the area and stopped the car that the petitioner was driving and

questioned the petitioner with a view to obtain information and identify the petitioner. At that time,

as the petitioner behaved in a suspicious manner and gave contradictory answers to his questions,

he arrested the petitioner.

Though it is possible to arrest an individual without a warrant, such arrest must be based on

probable cause for the police to believe that a person has committed cognizable offence. Moreover,

the arrest of the petitioner merely because his behaviour was suspicious, is not a ground for arrest

under section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Further, if a person is arrested for

committing an offence, he should be informed of the reasons for the arrest at the time of the arrest.

After the petitioner was arrested, he was taken to the police station. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent

filed an A Report in the Magistrates Court of Vauniya and moved court to remand the petitioner

in order to carry out further investigations to ascertain whether he was involved in committing a

crime. The said A report states that;

2014.11.28

.

Subsequently 2nd respondent filed a B Report in the said Magistrates Court stating that the

petitioner refused to make a statement in terms of section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act. The said B report was titled;

8

,

.

A careful consideration of the aforementioned A report and B report filed in the Magistrates

Court show that the petitioner was not interrogated in connection with any cognizable offence.

Further, there was no credible complaint, credible information or material to show that the

petitioner had committed or had conspired to commit or abetted the commission of such an offence.

Moreover, the materials field in court did not show that there were grounds to form a reasonable

suspicion that the petitioner had committed or abetted the commission of such an offence.

Further, even though the 2nd respondent filed a B report stating that the petitioner committed the

offence under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the learned Magistrate was subsequently

informed that the Police would not proceed against the petitioner consequent to the advice given

by the Attorney General.

Conclusion

I have considered the materials filed in the instant application and I am of the opinion that the 1st,

2nd and 3rd respondents failed to produce any materials that could justify forming a reasonable

suspicion that the petitioner was responsible for committing any cognizable offence or any other

offence.

Therefore, the arrest is contrary to the provisions of section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Code of

Criminal Procedure Act and was not in accordance with the applicable procedure established by

law. Further, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents failed to produce materials that there were sufficient

grounds to produce the petitioner in the Magistrates Court and to make an application to the

learned Magistrate to remand him. Moreover, there were no materials to file a B report stating

that the petitioner refused to make a statement to the Police in terms of section 109 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

9

Hence, I hold that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents have violated Article 13(1) of the Constitution.

Accordingly, I order the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000/- to the petitioner.
