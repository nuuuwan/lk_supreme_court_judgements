"","clearly  stated  that  the  word  “dispossession”  in  Section  4  could  also  be"

"","Lanka is in favour of an extended scope of applicability for this provisional"
"","remedy. This would suffice to dispose of the argument of the Counsel for the"

"","namely the requirement of dispossession had not been proved because there"
"","had been no physical eviction from the land. Justice Vythialingam, however,"
"","rightly  pointed  out  that  the  need  to  establish  deprivation  of  possession"
"","would be satisfied if the possessor was deprived from exercising his right of"
"","possession. This interpretation of the term dispossession may be traced to"
