"28.  As I have demonstrated, the difference between the judgments of the District",""
"","Court  and  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  has  revolved  around  the  word"
"","“dispossession”  and  the  error  of  the  court  a  quo  has  been  the  failure  to"
"","equiparate dispossession on the one hand, and disturbance of possession on"
"","the other hand, and treating them separately. For purposes of Section 4 of"
"","the  Prescription  Ordinance,  both  these  acts  would  fall  within  the  term"
"","dispossession in appropriate circumstances."
"29.","I  answer  the  question  of  law  in  the  negative  and  proceed  to  set  aside  the"
"","judgment of the District Court dated 24.06.2010 and affirm the judgment of"
"","the Civil Appellate High Court dated 13.02.2013. The appeal of the Defendant"
