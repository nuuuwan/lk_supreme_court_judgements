K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J.

This is an appeal to set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province holden in Mount Lavinia dated 06.02.2019 which

affirmed the order of the District Court of Moratuwa dated 08.03.2016.

ThePlaintiff-JudgmentCreditorRespondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) instituted an action in the District

CourtofMoratuwaagainsttheDefendant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) based on an agreement to sell

bearing No. 682 dated 15.11. 2007 with regard to the land and premises

morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint. The Defendant was absent

and unrepresented when the case came up in open court. The Appellant

gave ex-parte evidence and the District Court delivered the Judgment dated

24.08.2009 in favour of the Appellant.

The decree was served on the Defendant and she did not take any steps to

get the said ex-parte judgment and the decree vacated. The Appellant

thereaftermadeanapplicationfortheexecutionofthedecree.On

08.07.2010, the Fiscal Officer of the District Court of Moratuwa proceeded

to the premises in suit and executed the writ of possession by handing over

the peaceful and vacant possession of the premises to the Appellant. The

Fiscal had reported to the Court by her report dated 08.07.2010 that the

Petitioners-Respondents-Respondents(hereinafterreferredtoasthe

Respondents) were in the occupation of the premises in suit and vacant

possession had been handed over peacefully and voluntarily by them.

Thereafter, the Respondents made an application under Section 328 of the

Civil Procedure Code to the District Court of Moratuwa seeking restoration

of the Respondents possession of a part of the premises in suit. After the

conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Additional Judge of the District Court

ofMoratuwadeliveredtheorderdated08.03.2016infavourofthe

Respondents.

The Appellant made a Revision application before the Civil Appellate High

Court of Mount Lavinia against the said order. The High Court dismissed the

Revision application on the basis that the Appellant has failed to plead the

existence of exceptional circumstances. In the Judgment of the High Court,

it was held that the Respondents were in possession of the premises in suit

on their own right and not under the leave and license of the Defendant.

Thus, the Respondents were not a party to the District Court action bearing

No. 647/L and the application under Section 328 of the Civil Procedure

Code is made when a person who is not a party to an action is dispossessed

in the execution of a decree.

The Appellant is before this Court challenging the said Judgment. This

Court by Order dated 19.06.2020 granted Leave to Appeal on the questions

of law stated in paragraph 34 (a) and (b) of the Petition dated 15.03.2019, as

set out below,

(a) Did the Learned High Court Judges as well as the Additional District

Court Judge err in law and fact in not considering that there are exceptional

circumstances?

(b) Did the Learned High Court Judge as well as the Additional District

Court Judge err in law and fact in not considering the documents V1 and V2

as admissible evidence in the correct perspective?

My analysis hereafter will be confined to examine the aforesaid question of

law based on which leave was granted.

The first matter for consideration by this court is whether there are

exceptional circumstances to file a revision application against the Order of

the District Court dated 08.03.2016.

5

It is a trite law that the revisionary powers of the courts are exercised only if

exceptionalcircumstancesareshownbythepartyfilingsuchan

application.

In Dharmaratne and another vs Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others

[2003] 3 SLR 24, Amaratunga J. stated that,

existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which courts select

the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification should

be adopted.Ifsuch a selection process is not there, revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court will become a gateway of every litigant to

make a second appeal in the garb of a Revisionary Application or to

make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of

appeal.

The practice of court to insist in the existence of exceptional circumstances for

the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got

hardened into a rule which would not be lightly disturbed. [emphasis added]

In Wijesinghe vs Tharmaratnam, Srikanthas LR (IV) at page 49, the

court held that,

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of court.

In the present case, the Respondents have argued that the Appellant failed

to provide exceptional circumstances at the High Court and therefore, the

application should be rejected in limine.

On the other hand, the counsel for the Appellant stated that the grounds of

appeal relied upon by the Appellant in paragraph 14 of the revision

applicationfiledbeforetheHighCourtdated08.04.20016constitute

exceptional circumstances.

6

The Appellant has submitted following questions of law when pleading

exceptional circumstances.

(g) the said judgment is contrary to law and against the weight of evidence

led at the said inquiry.

(h) the Learned Additional District Judge misdirected himself in holding that

the petitioners were not holding a part of the premises in suit occupied by

them under the defendant.

(i) the Learned Additional District Judge misdirected himself on the said deed

of declaration and the said plan produced by the petitioners.

(j) the Learned Additional District Judge failed to properly evaluate the

evidence adduced at the inquiry by me.

(k) the petitioners were in occupation of the said land under the defendant,

and the Learned Additional District Judge erred grossly in arriving at the

contrary.

(l) the Learned Additional District Judge erred and misdirected himself both on

the law and facts of this case. ..

The above grounds set out in the revision application by the Appellant are

merely grounds of appeal which are centered on the issues framed in the

trial and not exceptional circumstances.

Section 329 of the Civil Procedure code sets out the following; No appeal

shall lie from any order made under section 326 or section 327 or section

328 against any party other than the judgment debtor. Any such order shall

not bar the right of such party to institute an action to establish his right or

title to such property.

In light of the abovementioned section the Appellant has no right of appeal

against the order of the District Judge however, this does not prevent him

7

from invoking revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. However, invoking

suchrevisionaryjurisdictionissubjecttotheAppellantprovingthe

existence of exceptional circumstances.

It is an obvious fact that revisionary jurisdiction of this court is exercised if

and when only exceptional circumstances are proved by the Appellant which

is an extraordinary power vested in court. This power is vested in court in

order to prevent miscarriage of justice being done to a person and also for

due administration of justice as discussed below.

In Rustom vs. Hapangama and Co., 1978-79 Sri LR 225, Ismail J. stated

that,

the powers by way of revision conferred on the Appellate Court are very wide

and can be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against an order of

the original Court or not. However, such powers would be exercised only in

exceptionalcircumstances where an appeallay and as to what such

exceptional circumstances are is dependant on the facts of each case.

In the case of A. R. G. Fernando vs. W. S. C. Fernando 72 NLR 549

availability of revision where the appeal lies has been considered and it was

held that;

Where a right of appeal lies, an application in revision will not be entertained

unless there are exceptional circumstances which require the intervention of

the Court by way of revision.

In Bank of Ceylon vs Kaleel and others [2004] 1 SLR 284, it was stated

that,

In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it; the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court.[emphasis added]

8

From the above case laws, it is evident that our courts have consistently

held that the revisionary power of Courts is an extraordinary power. The

Courts must exercise revisionary jurisdiction only if there are exceptional

circumstances, when the law has expressly provided the aggrieved party a

right of appeal.

Some examples for exceptional circumstances were given in Attorney

General vs. Podi Singho (1950) 51 NLR 381 where Dias J. held that the

revisionary powers should be exercised only in circumstances such as:

(a) Miscarriage of justice;

(b) Where a strong case for interference by the Supreme Court is made out;

(c) Where the applicant was unaware of the order.

In Caroline Nona and Others vs. Pedrick Singho and Others, (2005) 3 Sri

L.R 176, it was stated that,

This Court possesses the power to set aside in revision an erroneous decision

ofthe District Court which amounts to a miscarriage of justice in an

appropriate case even though an appeal against such decision has been

available to the petitioner and he has not resorted to that remedy.

The above case laws elucidates that the court can allow revision application

even when the right of appeal has not been wielded when such decision

amounts to a miscarriage of justice.

The argument of the Appellant is that the said order of the District Court

under Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code amounts to a miscarriage of

justice, and therefore, the revision application filed should be allowed. In

support of this argument, the counsel for the Appellant has referred to

Bengamuwa Dhammaloka Thero vs. Dr. Cyril Anton Balasuriya 2010 1

S.L.R 195 where Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J stated at 206 that,

It is apparent that the decision of the District Court was not only erroneous

butalsoamountsto a miscarriage ofjustice.In such circumstances,

notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section 329 of the Civil Procedure

9

Code, the Court of Appeal is empowered to set right an erroneous decision of

the District Court for the purpose of exercising due administration of justice

and for such purpose could exercise its power of revision.

In the above case, the Respondent was displaced and his application in the

District Court under Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code was dismissed.

The Respondent thereafter filed a Revision Application in the Court of

Appeal against the District Court order instead of filing an appeal. The Court

of Appeal allowed the application on the basis that the Respondent had been

dispossessed consequent to an invalid decree. The Supreme Court in

upholdingtheabovepositionstatedthattheRespondentsrevision

application should be allowed as the dismissal of Respondents application

amounts to a miscarriage of justice.

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the facts and the circumstances in the

above case differ from that of the case at hand as the basis of the former is

an invalid District Court action whereas, the District Court action in the

present case is a valid one.

However, in order to ascertain whether the order of the District Court in the

present case amounts to a miscarriage of justice, it is pivotal to analyze

Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code which states as follows,

Where any person other than the judgment-debtor or a person in occupation

under him is disposed of any property in execution of a decree, he may, within

fifteen days of such dispossession, apply to the court by petition in which the

judgment-creditorshallbenamedrespondentcomplainingofsuch

dispossession..

Accordingly, a person making a claim under section 328 must prove that,

i. he or she was not a party to the initial action,

ii. the possession of the subject matter on his own account, or on account of

some person other than the judgment-debtor,

10

iii. he or she was dispossessed of the property in question in execution of a

decree.

ThefirstargumentoftheAppellantinthisregardisthatthe

Petitioner-Respondents- Respondents did not resist the Fiscal Officer who

came to the said property on 08.07.2010 to execute the writ of possession

granted by the District Court. Hence, the Respondents cannot institute an

action under section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code as they were not

dispossessed of the property in execution of the decree but rather the

vacant possession had been handed over peacefully and voluntarily by

them.

In defining the term dispossession in Edirisuriya vs. Edirisuriya (1975)

45 NLR 288, Vythialingam J. held that neither force or fraud is necessary

in dispossession as it can be by force or by not allowing the possessor to use

at his discretion what he possesses.

In Perera vs. Wijesuriya, (1957) 59 NLR 529, Basnayake, C.J at page 532

stated that, Any act which deprives a person from exercising his rights of

possession would be deprivation of his possession or an ouster of him.

In the present case, the Fiscal Officer has admitted in the cross-examination

that two lawyers arrived on behalf of the Respondents at the time of

executing the writ even though such incident was not mentioned in her

report. (page 246 to 248 of the brief) Thus, the Fiscal Officer admitted that

the Defendant was not present at the subject matter of this case when

executingthewrit.(page249ofthebrief)Thiselucidatesthatthe

Respondents resisted and were dispossessed of the property even though no

force was involved.

IntherecentcaseofFawsanvMajeedMohamedandOthers

(SC/APPEAL/135/2017decidedon31.03.2023)JusticeMahinda

Samayawardhena held that, In terms of section 328, where any person other

11

than the judgment debtor or a person in occupation under him is dispossessed

of any property in execution of a decree, he may, within 15 days of such

dispossession, apply to Court by way of a petition in which the judgment

creditorshallbenamedastherespondent,complainingofsuch

dispossession. The Court shall thereupon serve a copy of the petition on the

respondent and require such respondent to file objections, if any, within 15

days of service. Upon objections being filed or after the lapse of the period in

which objections were directed to be filed, the Court shall hold an inquiry. The

present section is different from the previous one. Section 328 cannot be

invoked by the judgment-debtor or a person under him. According to the literal

interpretation of this section, if after the inquiry the Court is satisfied that the

person dispossessed was in possession of the whole or part of the property on

his own account or on account of some person other than the judgment-debtor,

the petitioner shall be restored to possession. However, this section shall be

given purposive interpretation. It may be recalled that under section 324(1),

the fiscal can remove any person bound by the decree who refuses to vacate

the property. Mere proof of possession on his own account or on account of

some person other than the judgment-debtor cannot and should not, in my

view, entitle such petitioner to be restored to possession. In addition, he shall

prove that he was in possession in good faith and by virtue of any right or

interest. This is not to say that he shall prove title to such property, which is

not possible given the time frame for the conclusion of the inquiry. As I stated

earlier, those are the requirements of a claimant who is or claims to be in

possession under sections 325-327, and a claimant under section 328 need

not or cannot be placed at a more advantageous position.

The aim of this court is to ensure that justice has been done to all parties

concerned. The question of law that is before this court is the existence of

exceptionalcircumstanceswherethecourt'srevisionarypowersare

exercised.Therefore, based on the circumstances of the case, it can be

distinguished from the above mentioned case as the questions of law for

which leave has been granted revolves around the existence of exceptional

12

circumstances for invoking revisionary jurisdiction and not on whether the

right of invoking revisionary jurisdiction existed.

As the second argument, the Appellant contends that the order of the

District Court amounts to a miscarriage of justice which considered as

exceptional circumstance by the Appellant as the Learned District

Court judge has failed to recognize V1 and V2 and this is the second

question of law for which leave was granted by this court. The Appellant

contends that the Respondents were in possession of the land on leave and

license of the Defendant and their possession was not independent. In order

to support this position, the Appellant has produced the documents marked

V1 and V2.

The document marked V1 is a letter signed by the 1st Respondent dated

08.10.2010 addressing the Learned District Court Judge. In this letter, the

1st Respondent has admitted that he has been in possession of the premises

in the suit under the leave and license of the Defendant and he has vacated

the premises with consent. The letter further states that the 1st Respondent

intends to withdraw the petition and affidavit dated 22.07.2010 and he is

going to revoke the proxy filed on his behalf in the District Court.

ThedocumentmarkedV2isacomplaintmadetothe Police dated

07.09.2010 by the 1st Respondent stating that he has been in possession of

the premises in the suit under leave and license of the Defendant and he

has given his consent to vacate the same.

When these documents were formally produced at the inquiry before the

District Court, the 2nd Respondent who is the wife of the 1st Respondent

admitted the signature of the 1st Respondent in the said two documents.

However, the 2nd Respondent has rejected the position taken in the above

two documents. In cross-examination, the 2nd Respondent stated that

subsequent to the dispossession the 1st Respondent started wandering from

place to place consuming alcohol excessively and the above two documents

13

have been signed by him under the influence of alcohol. (page 232 of the

brief)

Further, it is noteworthy that the letter marked V1 had been forwarded to

the court by the 1st Respondent himself without sending such through the

Attorney-at-Law representing him in the District Court on the same matter.

The 1st Respondent has never revoked the proxy filed on behalf of him.

Hence,thiselucidatesthatbothRespondentsarecontinuedtobe

represented by the same Attorney-at-Law since the commencement of this

action and the content of said documents does not represent the position of

both Respondents.

Accordingly, the Respondents only have to prove that they were in the

possession of the subject matter of their own right and not under the license

of the Defendant. In order to prove the independent possession of the

subject matter, the Petitioner-Respondents- Respondents have produced an

Electricity Bill (X3), Water Bill (X4), and the Notice of Assessment (X7) sent

by the Municipal Council of Moratuwa in the name of the 1st Petitioner-

Respondent-Respondent.

Further, the Petitioners-Respondents- Respondents have presented a Deed

of Declaration No. N137 (X1) dated 08.03.2007 executed by L.P. Weerakkodi

Notary Public with regard to the disputed land. It is important to note that

the above Deed of Declaration had been executed one year prior to the

institution of the initial action in the District Court by the Appellant and the

Petitioners-Respondents- Respondents were not made a party to this case.

According to this deed, the father of the 1st Respondent had been in

independent possession of the property in dispute for more than four

decades. Hence, if the Appellant had done an initial investigation in the

relevant land registry before entering into the agreement with the Defendant,

this matter could have been avoided.

14

The Petitioners-Respondents-Respondents have also produced a certificate

issuedbytheGramaNiladhari(X5)tothe2nd

Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent dated 14.09.2000 as proof of residency.

Furthermore, the Respondents have produced a reply letter sent by a lawyer

on behalf of the 1st Respondent dated 31.05.2004 in answer to a Letter of

Demand sent by the lawyer of the Defendant. In this letter (X6), the 1st

Respondent has specifically stated that he does not admit the alleged

entitlement of the Defendant to the premises in suit.

In addition to these documents, the 2nd Respondent has given evidence

stating that she came to the property in the suit on 25.03.1981 after getting

marriedtothe1stRespondentandshehadbeeninuninterrupted

possession of the same with the 1st Respondent until July 2010. (page 217

of the brief) The above facts have been verified by the oral evidence adduced

by the Grama Sewaka of the relevant division. (pages 234 and 235 of the

brief)

Fromtheaboveoral and documentary evidence, it is clear that the

Respondents have successfully proved the independent and bona fide

possession of the property in question. Hence, I am of the opinion that the

Respondents have fulfilled the requirements of an application under section

328 of the Civil Procedure Code and the order of the District Court does not

constitute a miscarriage of justice.

15

The above analysis elucidates that the both questions of law in the present

case are based on the existence of exceptional circumstances and the

Appellant failed to plead exceptional grounds which shock the conscience

of the court. In the absence of exceptional grounds, my considered view is

that revisionary jurisdiction will not lie in the present case.

In the case ofAmeen vs. Rasheed (1936) 38 NLR 288, the revision

application was dismissed for not having exceptional circumstances in an

appealable order and it was held that,

It has been represented to us on the part of the petitioner that even if we find

the order to be appealable, we still have discretion to act in revision. It has

been said in this Court often enough that revision of an appealable order is an

exceptional proceeding, and in the petition no reason is given why this

method of rectification has been sought rather than the ordinary

method of appeal. [emphasis added]

In Attorney General v Gunawardena [1996] 2 SLR 149, it was held that,

Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors but it is

supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice and

notprimarilyorsolelytherelievingofgrievancesofaparty.

[emphasis added]

16

In the present case, the Appellant has not been successful in convincing the

Court that the grounds he had urged have any exceptional nature which is

sufficient to move the Court to exercise its discretionary revisionary power.

Therefore, this Court has no reason to disagree with the conclusion of the

Provincial High Court.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, the appeal is hereby

dismissed without costs.
