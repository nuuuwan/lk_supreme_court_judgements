"circumstances for
invoking revisionary jurisdiction and not on whether the"
"right of
invoking revisionary jurisdiction existed."
"As the second argument,
the Appellant contends that the order of the"
"District Court amounts to a miscarriage of
justice which considered as"
"exceptional
circumstance
by
the Appellant
as
the
Learned District"
"Court
judge has
failed to recognize V1 and V2 and this is the second"
"question of law for which leave was granted by this court.
The Appellant"
"contends that
the Respondents were in possession of
the land on leave and"
"license of
the Defendant and their possession was not independent. In order"
"to support
this position,
the Appellant has produced the documents marked"
"V1 and V2."
"The document marked V1 is a letter signed by the 1st Respondent dated"
"08.10.2010 addressing the Learned District Court Judge.
In this letter,
the"
"1st Respondent has admitted that he has been in possession of the premises"
"in the suit under the leave and license of
the Defendant and he has vacated"
"the premises with consent. The letter further states that
the 1st Respondent"
"intends to withdraw the petition and affidavit dated 22.07.2010 and he is"
"going to revoke the proxy filed on his behalf
in the District Court."
"The
document marked
V2
is
a
complaint made
to
the
Police
dated"
"07.09.2010 by the 1st Respondent stating that he has been in possession of"
"the premises in the suit under
leave and license of
the Defendant and he"
"has given his consent to vacate the same."
"When these documents were
formally produced at
the inquiry before the"
"District Court,
the 2nd Respondent who is the wife of
the 1st Respondent"
"admitted the
signature of
the 1st Respondent
in the said two documents."
"However,
the 2nd Respondent has rejected the position taken in the above"
"two
documents.
In
cross-examination,
the
2nd
Respondent
stated
that"
"subsequent
to the dispossession the 1st Respondent started wandering from"
"place to place consuming alcohol excessively and the above two documents"
