"iii. he or she was dispossessed of
the property in question in execution of a"
"decree."
"The
first
argument
of
the
Appellant
in
this
regard
is
that
the"
"Petitioner-Respondents- Respondents did not
resist
the Fiscal Officer who"
"came to the said property on 08.07.2010 to execute the writ of possession"
"granted by the District Court. Hence,
the Respondents cannot
institute an"
"action under
section 328
of
the Civil
Procedure Code as
they were not"
"‘dispossessed’
of
the
property
in execution of
the decree but
rather
the"
"vacant
possession
had
been
handed
over
peacefully
and
voluntarily
by"
"them."
"In defining the term ‘dispossession’
in Edirisuriya vs. Edirisuriya (1975)"
"45 NLR 288, Vythialingam J. held that neither
force or fraud is necessary"
"in dispossession as it can be “by force or by not allowing the possessor to use"
"at his discretion what he possesses”."
"In Perera vs. Wijesuriya,
(1957) 59 NLR 529, Basnayake, C.J at page 532"
"stated that,
“Any act which deprives a person from exercising his rights of"
"possession would be deprivation of his possession or an ouster of him.”"
"In the present case, the Fiscal Officer has admitted in the cross-examination"
"that
two
lawyers
arrived
on
behalf
of
the Respondents
at
the
time
of"
"executing
the writ
even though such incident was not mentioned in her"
"report.
(page 246 to 248 of
the brief) Thus,
the Fiscal Officer admitted that"
"the Defendant was not present at
the
subject matter
of
this
case when"
"executing
the
writ.
(page
249
of
the
brief)
This
elucidates
that
the"
"Respondents resisted and were dispossessed of the property even though no"
"force was involved."
