"It
is a trite law that the revisionary powers of the courts are exercised only if"
"exceptional
circumstances
are
shown
by
the
party
filing
such
an"
"application."
"In Dharmaratne and another vs Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others"
"[2003] 3 SLR 24, Amaratunga J. stated that,"
"“existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which courts select"
"the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification should"
"be
adopted.
If
such
a
selection
process
is
not
there,
revisionary"
"jurisdiction of
this Court will become a gateway of every litigant
to"
"make a second appeal
in the garb of a Revisionary Application or
to"
"make an appeal
in situations where the legislature has not given a right of"
"appeal."
"The practice of court
to insist
in the existence of exceptional circumstances for"
"the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got"
"hardened into a rule which would not be lightly disturbed.” [emphasis added]"
"In Wijesinghe
vs Tharmaratnam, Srikantha’s LR (IV)
at page 49,
the"
"court held that,"
"“Revision is a discretionary
remedy and will not be available unless
the"
"application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of court.”"
"In the present case,
the Respondents have argued that
the Appellant
failed"
"to provide exceptional circumstances at
the High Court and therefore,
the"
"application should be rejected in limine."
"On the other hand,
the counsel
for the Appellant stated that
the grounds of"
"appeal
relied
upon
by
the
Appellant
in
paragraph
14
of
the
revision"
"application
filed
before
the
High
Court
dated
08.04.20016
constitute"
"exceptional circumstances."
