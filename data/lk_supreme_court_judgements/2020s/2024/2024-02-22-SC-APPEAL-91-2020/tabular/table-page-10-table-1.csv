"Code,
the Court of Appeal
is empowered to set right an erroneous decision of"
"the District Court
for
the purpose of exercising due administration of
justice"
"and for such purpose could exercise its power of revision.”"
"In the above case,
the Respondent was displaced and his application in the"
"District Court under Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code was dismissed."
"The Respondent
thereafter
filed
a Revision
Application
in the Court
of"
"Appeal against the District Court order instead of filing an appeal. The Court"
"of Appeal allowed the application on the basis that the Respondent had been"
"dispossessed
consequent
to
an
invalid
decree.
The
Supreme
Court
in"
"upholding
the
above
position
stated
that
the
Respondent’s
revision"
"application should be allowed as the dismissal of Respondent’s application"
"amounts to a miscarriage of
justice."
"Nevertheless,
it
is noteworthy that
the facts and the circumstances in the"
"above case differ from that of
the case at hand as the basis of
the former is"
"an invalid District Court action whereas,
the District Court action in the"
"present case is a valid one."
"However,
in order to ascertain whether the order of the District Court in the"
"present
case amounts
to a miscarriage
of
justice,
it
is pivotal
to analyze"
"Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code which states as follows,"
"“Where any person other than the judgment-debtor or a person in occupation"
"under him is disposed of any property in execution of a decree, he may, within"
"fifteen days of such dispossession, apply to the court by petition in which the"
"judgment-creditor
shall
be
named
respondent
complaining
of
such"
"dispossession…..”"
"Accordingly, a person making a claim under section 328 must prove that,"
"i. he or she was not a party to the initial action,"
"ii.
the possession of the subject matter on his own account, or on account of"
"some person other than the judgment-debtor,"
