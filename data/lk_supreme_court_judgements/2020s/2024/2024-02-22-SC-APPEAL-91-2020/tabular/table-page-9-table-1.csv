"From the above case laws,
it
is evident
that our courts have consistently"
"held that
the
revisionary power of Courts is an extraordinary power. The"
"Courts must exercise revisionary jurisdiction only if
there are exceptional"
"circumstances, when the law has expressly provided the aggrieved party a"
"right of appeal."
"Some
examples
for
exceptional
circumstances were
given
in Attorney"
"General vs. Podi Singho (1950) 51 NLR 381 where Dias J. held that
the"
"revisionary powers should be exercised only in circumstances such as:"
"(a) Miscarriage of justice;"
"(b) Where a strong case for interference by the Supreme Court is made out;"
"(c) Where the applicant was unaware of the order."
"In Caroline Nona and Others vs. Pedrick Singho and Others,
(2005) 3 Sri"
"L.R 176,
it was stated that,"
"“This Court possesses the power to set aside in revision an erroneous decision"
"of
the District
Court which
amounts
to
a miscarriage
of
justice
in
an"
"appropriate
case
even though an appeal against
such decision has been"
"available to the petitioner and he has not resorted to that remedy.”"
"The above case laws elucidates that
the court can allow revision application"
"even when the
right
of appeal has not been wielded when such decision"
"amounts to a miscarriage of
justice."
"The argument of
the Appellant
is that
the said order of
the District Court"
"under Section 328 of
the Civil Procedure Code amounts to a miscarriage of"
"justice, and therefore,
the revision application filed should be allowed.
In"
"support
of
this
argument,
the
counsel
for
the Appellant has
referred to"
"Bengamuwa Dhammaloka Thero vs. Dr. Cyril Anton Balasuriya 2010 1"
"S.L.R 195 where Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J stated at 206 that,"
"“It
is apparent
that
the decision of
the District Court was not only erroneous"
"but
also
amounts
to
a miscarriage
of
justice.
In
such
circumstances,"
"notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section 329 of the Civil Procedure"
