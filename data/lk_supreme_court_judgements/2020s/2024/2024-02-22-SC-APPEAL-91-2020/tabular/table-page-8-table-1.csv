"from invoking revisionary jurisdiction of
the High Court. However,
invoking"
"such
revisionary
jurisdiction
is
subject
to
the
Appellant
proving
the"
"existence of exceptional circumstances."
"It
is an obvious fact
that revisionary jurisdiction of
this court
is exercised if"
"and when only exceptional circumstances are proved by the Appellant which"
"is an extraordinary power vested in court. This power
is vested in court
in"
"order
to prevent miscarriage of
justice being done to a person and also for"
"due administration of justice as discussed below."
"In Rustom vs. Hapangama and Co., 1978-79 Sri LR 225,
Ismail J. stated"
"that,"
"“the powers by way of revision conferred on the Appellate Court are very wide"
"and can be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against an order of"
"the original Court or not. However, such powers would be exercised only in"
"exceptional
circumstances where
an
appeal
lay
and
as
to what
such"
"exceptional circumstances are is dependant on the facts of each case.”"
"In the
case
of A. R. G. Fernando vs. W. S. C. Fernando 72 NLR 549"
"availability of revision where the appeal
lies has been considered and it was"
"held that;"
"“Where a right of appeal
lies, an application in revision will not be entertained"
"unless there are exceptional circumstances which require the intervention of"
"the Court by way of revision.”"
"In Bank of Ceylon vs Kaleel and others [2004] 1 SLR 284,
it was stated"
"that,"
"“In any event
to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order
challenged must"
"have
occasioned a failure of
justice and be manifestly erroneous which go"
"beyond
an
error
or
defect
or
irregularity
that an ordinary
person would"
"instantly react
to it; the order complained of
is of such a nature which"
"would have shocked the conscience of court.”[emphasis added]"
