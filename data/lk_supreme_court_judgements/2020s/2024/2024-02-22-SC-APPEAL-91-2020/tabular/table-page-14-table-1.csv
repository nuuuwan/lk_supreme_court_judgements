"have been signed by him under
the influence of alcohol.
(page 232 of
the"
"brief)"
"Further,
it
is noteworthy that
the letter marked V1 had been forwarded to"
"the court by the 1st Respondent himself without sending such through the"
"Attorney-at-Law representing him in the District Court on the same matter."
"The
1st Respondent has never
revoked the proxy
filed on behalf
of him."
"Hence,
this
elucidates
that
both
Respondents
are
continued
to
be"
"represented by the same Attorney-at-Law since the commencement of
this"
"action and the content of said documents does not represent the position of"
"both Respondents."
"Accordingly,
the Respondents
only have
to
prove
that
they were
in the"
"possession of
the subject matter of their own right and not under the license"
"of
the Defendant.
In
order
to
prove
the
independent
possession of
the"
"subject matter,
the Petitioner-Respondents- Respondents have produced an"
"Electricity Bill
(X3), Water Bill
(X4), and the Notice of Assessment
(X7) sent"
"by
the Municipal Council
of Moratuwa in the name of
the 1st Petitioner-"
"Respondent-Respondent."
"Further,
the Petitioners-Respondents- Respondents have presented a Deed"
"of Declaration No. N137 (X1) dated 08.03.2007 executed by L.P. Weerakkodi"
"Notary Public with regard to the disputed land.
It
is important
to note that"
"the
above Deed
of Declaration had been executed one
year prior
to
the"
"institution of
the initial action in the District Court by the Appellant and the"
"Petitioners-Respondents- Respondents were not made a party to this case."
"According
to
this
deed,
the
father
of
the
1st Respondent
had
been
in"
"independent
possession
of
the
property
in
dispute
for more
than
four"
"decades. Hence,
if
the Appellant had done an initial
investigation in the"
"relevant land registry before entering into the agreement with the Defendant,"
"this matter could have been avoided."
