"than the judgment debtor or a person in occupation under him is dispossessed"
"of any property in execution of a decree, he may, within 15 days of such"
"dispossession, apply to Court by way of a petition in which the judgment"
"creditor
shall
be
named
as
the
respondent,
complaining
of
such"
"dispossession. The Court shall
thereupon serve a copy of
the petition on the"
"respondent and require such respondent
to file objections,
if any, within 15"
"days of service. Upon objections being filed or after the lapse of
the period in"
"which objections were directed to be filed, the Court shall hold an inquiry. The"
"present
section is different
from the
previous
one. Section 328 cannot be"
"invoked by the judgment-debtor or a person under him. According to the literal"
"interpretation of
this section,
if after the inquiry the Court
is satisfied that the"
"person dispossessed was in possession of the whole or part of the property on"
"his own account or on account of some person other than the judgment-debtor,"
"the petitioner shall be restored to possession. However,
this section shall be"
"given purposive interpretation.
It may be recalled that under section 324(1),"
"the fiscal can remove any person bound by the decree who refuses to vacate"
"the property. Mere proof of possession on his own account or on account of"
"some person other
than the judgment-debtor
cannot and should not,
in my"
"view, entitle such petitioner to be restored to possession.
In addition, he shall"
"prove that he was in possession in good faith and by virtue of any right or"
"interest. This is not
to say that he shall prove title to such property, which is"
"not possible given the time frame for the conclusion of
the inquiry. As I stated"
"earlier,
those are the requirements of a claimant who is or
claims to be in"
"possession under sections 325-327, and a claimant under section 328 need"
"not or cannot be placed at a more advantageous position.‚Äù"
"The aim of
this court
is to ensure that
justice has been done to all parties"
"concerned. The question of
law that
is before this court
is the existence of"
"exceptional
circumstances
where
the
court's
revisionary
powers
are"
"exercised.
Therefore, based on the
circumstances
of
the case,
it can be"
"distinguished from the above mentioned case as the questions of
law for"
"which leave has been granted revolves around the existence of exceptional"
