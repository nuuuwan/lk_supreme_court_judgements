"The Appellant made a Revision application before the Civil Appellate High"
"Court of Mount Lavinia against the said order. The High Court dismissed the"
"Revision application on the basis that
the Appellant has failed to plead the"
"existence of exceptional circumstances.
In the Judgment of
the High Court,"
"it was held that
the Respondents were in possession of
the premises in suit"
"on their own right and not under
the leave and license of
the Defendant."
"Thus,
the Respondents were not a party to the District Court action bearing"
"No. 647/L and the application under Section 328 of
the Civil Procedure"
"Code is made when a person who is not a party to an action is dispossessed"
"in the execution of a decree."
"The Appellant
is
before
this Court
challenging
the
said Judgment. This"
"Court by Order dated 19.06.2020 granted Leave to Appeal on the questions"
"of
law stated in paragraph 34 (a) and (b) of the Petition dated 15.03.2019, as"
"set out below,"
"(a) Did the Learned High Court Judges as well as the Additional District"
"Court Judge err in law and fact in not considering that there are exceptional"
"circumstances?"
"(b) Did the Learned High Court Judge as well as
the Additional District"
"Court Judge err in law and fact in not considering the documents V1 and V2"
"as admissible evidence in the correct perspective?"
"My analysis hereafter will be confined to examine the aforesaid question of"
"law based on which leave was granted."
"The
first matter
for
consideration
by
this
court
is whether
there
are"
"exceptional circumstances to file a revision application against
the Order of"
"the District Court dated 08.03.2016."
