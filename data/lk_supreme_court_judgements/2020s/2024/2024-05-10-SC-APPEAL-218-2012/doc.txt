The plaintiff filed action in the District Court of Colombo on 18.11.2003

seeking declaration of title to the premises No. 420, Old Moor Street,

Colombo 12, ejectment of the defendant and those holding under him

therefrom, and damages in a sum of Rs. 100,000 from 01.11.2003 until

restoration of the plaintiff to vacant possession on the basis, inter alia,

that the defendant sublet the premises in violation of the Lease

Agreement. The defendant filed answer denying subletting and sought

dismissal of the plaintiffs action. At the trial, only the plaintiff and the

defendant gave evidence. The plaintiff produced documents marked P1-

P7 in his evidence. After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs

action on the basis that there was no subletting. On appeal, the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Colombo set aside the judgment of the District

Court on the basis that the defendant has sublet the premises and

entered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint. The

defendant is now before this Court against the judgment of the High

Court. At the hearing, both parties agreed to confine the scope of

argument to the question as to whether the High Court erred in law in

concluding that the defendant had sublet the premises in question.

The premises in suit are excepted premises under the Rent Act, No. 7 of

1972. The premises were admittedly leased to the defendant for 75 years

by Lease Agreement marked P1 dated 18.05.1987 subject to the terms

4

SC/APPEAL/218/2012

and conditions stated therein. Clause (f) of the Lease Agreement compels

the defendant lessee not to sublet or give on commission or part with

possession of the demised premises or any part thereof without the prior

written permission of the Lessor. The crux of the plaintiffs complaint is

that the defendant sublet the premises to the limited liability company,

Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited, without his written consent. The

defendant admits that the business in the premises is carried on by

Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited.

According to the official documents relevant to the said company which

were compendiously marked P4, the registered office of the company is

situated at the demised premises and there are four directors of the

company including the defendant.

The defendants position is that when he entered into the Lease

Agreement in 1987, there was no name for his business, and the business

was later carried on under the name Bright Steel (Private) Limited, and

in the year 2000, the business name was again changed to Ajantha

Hardwares (Private) Limited. Although it is submitted that the defendant

carried on the business in the premises under the name of Bright Steel

(Private) Limited prior to carrying on the business under the name of

Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited, the defendant did not mention

Bright Steel (Private) Limited in his evidence. His evidence regarding who

carried on the business was evasive. He attempted to suggest that there

was a partnership business. However, he did not produce any document

to prove a partnership business, nor did he at least disclose the names

of such partners. His evidence in Court was Ajantha Hardwares (Private)

Limited is a partnership business, which is incorrect in the teeth of the

documentary evidence marked P4.

The defendant also attempted to suggest that the plaintiff did not object

the business being carried on under the name of Bright Steel (Private)

5

SC/APPEAL/218/2012

Limited. According to the police complaint made by the plaintiff on

02.10.2000 marked P2, when the defendant was carrying on the business

under the name Bright Steel (Private) Limited, the plaintiff had already

filed another case against the defendant seeking to eject him from the

premises in suit. In any event, Bright Steel (Private) Limited is only a

business name, not an incorporated company. There is no evidence that

a third party carried on the business under the name Bright Steel

(Private) Limited.

The learned District Judge misdirected himself on the primary facts. He

states at page 8 of the judgment that the defendant first carried on

business through an incorporated company by the name of Bright Steel

(Private) Limited and thereafter the name of the company was changed to

Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited. There is no evidence that Bright

Steel (Private) Limited is an incorporated company, nor did the defendant

state so in his evidence. There is no evidence to suggest that the business

was carried on by the same group of people under Bright Steel (Private)

Limited and Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited.

The defendant did not give any reason as to why he wanted to incorporate

a company to carry on the business. Even assuming that the defendant

carried on a partnership business in the premises under the name Bright

Steel (Private) Limited, it does not mean that the defendant can thereafter

sublet or part with possession of the premises to an incorporated

company.

The District Judge at page 6 of the judgment states that, from the list of

directors of Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited found in P4 and from

the evidence of both the plaintiff and the defendant, it has clearly been

established that the defendant was the Chief Director ( )

of the company conducting the business in the premises. (

6

SC/APPEAL/218/2012

.) This is a grave misdirection on the primary facts.

As I stated previously, according to P4, there are four directors of the

company and the defendant is only one of them. P4 includes

Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the company.

In those documents, each of these four directors has been designated as

Business Executive. The defendant is not the Chief Director or the Main

Director or the Managing Director. According to clause 6 of the Articles

of Association, the Board of Directors can appoint a Managing Director.

In any event, directors or business executives are not the owners of the

company. They are employees of the company. According to clause 8 of

the Articles of Association, the remuneration of the directors is decided

by the Board of Directors or at a General Meeting of the company.

According to Article 5 of the Memorandum of Association of the company,

The authorised share capital of the company is Rupees five million (Rs.

5,000,000) divided into fifty thousand shares (50,000) of Rupees one

hundred (Rs. 100) each. This Article further states that all four directors

are shareholders of the company and each of them holds one share

valued at Rs. 100.

Contrary to what the District Judge states, it is abundantly clear that the

defendant is not the controlling shareholder or controlling director of the

company. According to Article 15 of the Articles of Association, the

business decisions of the company are taken by the Board of Directors

or at General Meetings. According to Article 10 of the Articles of

Association, two directors form a quorum for a Board Meeting. In

practical terms, the control of the company is with the other three

directors.

7

SC/APPEAL/218/2012

The High Court is correct in concluding that there was subletting of the

premises. The inclusion of the name of the defendant as a director and a

shareholder of the company formed to carry on the business in the

demised premises is a sham intended to conceal the subletting of the

premises to a different legal entity, namely, Ajantha Hardwares (Private)

Limited.

The premises were leased to the defendant who is a natural person. It

was not leased to an incorporated body which is, in the eyes of the law,

is a distinct legal personality. The defendant and the said incorporated

company by the name of Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited are not the

same.

The District Court has not considered any of these matters. It has gone

on the wrong premise that it is none other than the defendant who is

carrying on the hardware business in the premises as the Chief Director

of Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited.

I answer the question of law on which leave was granted in the negative.

The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is affirmed and the appeal

is dismissed. The District Court will now enter the decree as prayed for

in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the prayer to the plaint. The defendant is

in unlawful possession of these valuable business premises in Pettah for

more than 20 years from 01.11.2003. In addition to the damages, the

plaintiff is entitled to recover all incurred costs in the District Court, the

High Court and this Court from the defendant.
