"under the name Bright Steel (Private) Limited, the plaintiff had already"
"filed  another  case  against  the  defendant  seeking  to  eject  him  from  the"
"premises  in  suit.  In  any  event,  Bright  Steel  (Private)  Limited  is  only  a"
"business name, not an incorporated company. There is no evidence that"
"a  third  party  carried  on  the  business  under  the  name  Bright  Steel"

"business through an incorporated company by the name of Bright Steel"
"(Private) Limited and thereafter the name of the company was changed to"

"state so in his evidence. There is no evidence to suggest that the business"
"was carried on by the same group of people under Bright Steel (Private)"
"Limited and Ajantha Hardwares (Private) Limited."
"The defendant did not give any reason as to why he wanted to incorporate"

"directors  of  Ajantha  Hardwares  (Private)  Limited  found  in  P4  and  from"
"the evidence of both the plaintiff and the defendant, it has clearly been"
"established that the defendant was the Chief Director (ප්‍රධාන අධයක්ෂකවරයා)"
