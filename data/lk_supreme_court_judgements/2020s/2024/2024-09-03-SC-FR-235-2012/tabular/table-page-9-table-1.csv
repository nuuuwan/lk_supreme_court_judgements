"in respect of the complaint of the Petitioner, and their failure to do so was unlawful, and"
"hence  an  infringement  of  the  Petitioner’s  fundamental  right  guaranteed  under  Article"
"12(1) of the Constitution."
"The position of the 1st Respondent is that the motorcycle in issue was ‘taken’ by him since"
"allowing the motorcycle to be ridden by Wasantha Kumara within the premises of the"
"Department of Motor Traffic in Werahera was against the rules imposed in that regard"
"and was dangerous as his riding the motorcycle would be a threat to the life of others. He"
"has  also  asserted  that  he  took  the  motorcycle  without  any  protest  from  Wasantha"
"Kumara.  Thus,  the  position  of  the  1st  Respondent  was  that  there  was  justification  for"
"taking the motorcycle and that it was not done in a forcible manner. He has also asserted"
"that  he  told  Wasantha  Kumara  to  inform  the  registered  owner  to  come  and  take  the"
"motorcycle. He has denied the allegation that he ‘confiscated’ the motorcycle, a term used"
"at the time of the hearing by the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner."
