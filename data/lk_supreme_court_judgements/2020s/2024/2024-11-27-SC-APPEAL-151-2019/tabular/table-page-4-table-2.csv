"Dharmasena  had transferred his rights as Tenant Cultivator to aforesaid Nandawathie"
"Dissanayake, wife of the 2nd Respondent, through  that deed)"
"ï‚· 
That when such transfer was invalid, the 2nd Respondent  had no authority  to give the"
"tenancy rights to the Appellant who was named as the occupier in the said application."
"Thus,  by directing to evict the  occupier, namely  the  Appellant, 1st Respondent  had indirectly"
"come to the conclusion  that  the Appellant  was in occupation  of the  paddy land which means"
"that 
the  tenant  cultivator,  S.A.  Dharmasena  has  lost  his  possession  of  the  paddy  land  on"
"someday,  but  not  on 
the  alleged  date  of  eviction  in 
the  manner  alleged  in  the  relevant"
"application. Aforesaid findings  also indicate that  the  complainant,  S.A. Dharmasena  was the"
"Tenant Cultivator and transfer of his rights through  a deed was not valid. His application failed"
"as he failed to prove that he was removed from the land with the sanction of the 2 nd Respondent"
"on 03.05.1981 as alleged."
"The  aforesaid  S.  A.  Dharmasena,  being  aggrieved  by  the  said  decision  dated  01-07-1982"
"preferred an appeal to  the  Court of Appeal. As per the decision in the  said Appeal No. C.A."
"No. 470/82, aforesaid Appeal was dismissed on 10.11.1992.- vide the Judgment  found at pages"
"155 to 158 of the brief. The reason for dismissal also indicates that  it was the  opinion of the"
"Court  of Appeal that  said Dharmasena  failed to establish  that  he was evicted as alleged. The"
"said decision had not made any amendment  to the original decision of inquiry No. 42/3/93. As"
"such, said decision remain intact between the parties to said application, namely the Appellant,"
"S. A. Dharmasena and the 2nd Respondent."
"It  is pertinent  to note  that  the Appellant despite being  aware of the  decision of the  Assistant"
"Agrarian Commissioner,  the 1st Respondent,  directing that he be evicted from the paddy land,"
"failed to  appeal against  the  same.  Furthermore,  despite an  appeal being  filed by  said S. A."
"Dharmasena,  the  complainant  before the Commissioner,  and the Appellant being named  as a"
"Respondent  before the  Court  of  Appeal, the  Appellant  still failed to  challenge  the  decision"
"successfully as a party to the Appeal.  One may argue that  the Appellant cannot appeal against"
"the said decision in terms of section 5(3) of the Agrarian Services Act but he being an aggrieved"
"party  had  not  sought  any  revisionary  remedy  or  writ  against  such  decision  and  still such"
"decision  is  valid against  him.  It  must  also  be  noted  that  decision  in  aforesaid  application"
"No.42/3/93 was made on 01.07.1982. As per section 5(6) of the Agrarian Services Act of 1979"
"which prevailed at that time, where no appeal was made from a decision of the Commissioner"
"within the time allowed such  decision shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in"
"question in any  Court or tribunal. (This section later had been amended by Act No. 4 of 1991,"
"to  make  provision  to  submit  the  appeal to  Agrarian  Board  of  Review instead  of  Court  of"
"Appeal. However, the final and conclusive effect remain the same when there was no appeal."
"It is also observed that Agrarian Services Act was later repealed by the Agrarian Development"
"Act, No. 46 of 2000 which also in section 7(3) to (6) made provisions for inquiries and appeals"
"as well as finality effect for decisions when there is no appeal.  However, notwithstanding  the"
"said repeal of Agrarian Services Act, section 99(2) of the  Agrarian Development Act provides"
"for transitional situations.  However, the  decision in application no.42/3/93 dated 01.07.1982"
"as well as the  Judgment 
in C.A. 470/82 on  the  appeal made by  S.A Dharmasena  took  place"
"during the time Agrarian Services Act was in force.)."
