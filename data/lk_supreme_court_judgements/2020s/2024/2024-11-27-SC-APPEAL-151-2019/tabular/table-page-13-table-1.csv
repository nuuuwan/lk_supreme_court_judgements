"Q. viii. Whether their Lordships of the Court of Appeal as well as the learned High Court Judge"
"of  the  Provincial High  Court  of  Hambantota  have  failed to  appreciate  the  fact  that 
in  the"
"circumstances  of  this  case  and  specially due  to  his  own  conduct 
the  2nd  Respondent  was"
"estopped in law from seeking to eject the Petitioner after the expiry of more than 20 years from"
"the order dated 01/07/1982 and thereby erred in law?"
"A. Answered in the Negative. In fact, even though  the original decision in the inquiry was made"
"in 1982, date of the decision of the relevant judgment  in appeal is 10.11.1992. Thus, it has not"
"taken  20  years  from  that  judgment.  After  the  said judgment 
in  appeal  the  2 nd Respondent"
"appears to have requested the 1st Respondent to evict the Appellant as per the said decision and"
"later have appeared to file an application in the high  court to get  the 1st Respondent  to do his"
"public duty  in terms of the said decision."
"Hence, this appeal has to be dismissed with costs."
"Appeal is dismissed with costs."
