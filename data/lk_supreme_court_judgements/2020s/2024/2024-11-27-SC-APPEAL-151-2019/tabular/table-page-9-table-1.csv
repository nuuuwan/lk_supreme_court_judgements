"","during the inquiry as well as during the appeal. Further, the Appellant’s alleged tenancy"
"","rights  as tenant  cultivator was not  accepted in the said inquiry and in appeal. As said"
"","before, that  decision was not  challenged by  the Appellant in any  other  manner.  Even"
"","there is no prayer to that  effect in the petition filed in the application in HCA 27/2002."
"","Thus, he is an unlawful occupier who has to be evicted according to a valid decision in"
"","force. Hence, as alleged in the  said petition there cannot  be a valid creation of tenant"
"","cultivator and landlord relationship between him and the 2nd Respondent  after the said"
"","decision, without the approval of the Commissioner  as explained above."
"","Furthermore,  the Appellant had stated in his petition  in HCA 27/2002 that through  the"
"","letter marked P3, the 2nd Respondent requested 1st Respondent  to appoint the appellant"
"","as  the 
tenant  cultivator  and  the 
inquiry  based  on  that  request  has  been  postponed"
"","indefinitely as explained above. One of the prayers was to issue a writ of mandamus  to"
"","commence  that inquiry. However, the 2nd Respondent has denied the fact that he has so"
"","requested  the  1st Respondent.  If  the  facts  are disputed,  a  writ could  not  have  been"
"","considered based on that  issue. On the other hand, if the purported author of P3 denies"
"","it, a court cannot make  a direction to commence  an inquiry on that request."
"","It is the position taken in the said petition in HCA 27/2002 that since the decision in the"
"","inquiry No. 42/3/93 was that no eviction of the tenant  cultivator had taken place and it"
"","was confirmed  in  the  appeal,  an order in terms  of section  7(7)(b)11 of the  Agrarian"
"","Development  Act could not have been made to evict him from the paddy land. As said"
"","before, finding  was that it was not proved that S. A. Dharmasena,  the tenant  cultivator"
"","was evicted as alleged by him and however, that the paddy land has come into the hands"
"","of an unlawful  occupier, namely  the Appellant. Appellant had not challenged  the said"
"","decision to evict him  from  the  paddy land during  the  Appeal or if he has  no right  to"
"","appeal as averred, through  any  other means.  On the  other hand,  as mentioned  before,"
"","eviction of  the  Appellant had  been decided in  terms  of sections  11(2) and  (3) of the"
"","Agrarian Services Act which should be read along with sections 6 and 4(5) of the said"
"","Act which was within the power of the 1st Respondent  who inquired into the matter.  It"
"","is true that when ‘Pe1” was issued after the aforesaid settlement  in HC 85/2000, the Act"
"","in force was the Agrarian Development  Act. Most probably, the said Application in HC"
"","85/2000  would  have  been 
filed 
to  enforce 
the  public  duty 
entrusted 
to 
the  1 st"
"","Respondent  in  terms  of the  said Agrarian  Services Act,  and  therefore  it would have"
"","been proceeded after the repeal of the said Act and issued the said ‘Pe1’ in terms of the"
"","provisions  of 
the  Agrarian  Development  Act.  Section  99(2)  (g)  of 
the  Agrarian"
"","Development  Act  provides  for  such  situation  and  thus, 
the  proceedings  with  said"
"","application HC85/2000 and reaching  a settlement  and issuance of ‘Pe1’ appears to be"
"","lawful.  However, as  explained  above,  the  application  in  HC  85/2000  had  not  been"
"","annexed  to the  said application in HCA 27/2002 and, therefore it cannot  be observed"
"","whether it was an application filed after the enactment  of Agrarian development Act. If"
"","that  application was filed after the  enactment  of Agrarian development  Act, I see the"
"","possibility  of  forming  an  argument 
that 
the  said  Act  has  no  provision  to  enforce"
"","decisions or orders made  by  the  previous Act  since  the  orders referred to  in section"
"","99(2)(h) seems to be the orders made in terms of section 95 of the said Act and Section"
"","(20) (e)  (f) and (g) seem to be relevant to the pending actions which are not concluded."
"","However, on that assumption  the said writ application could not have decided in favour"
"","of 
the  Appellant  since 
the  most 
important  document 
in 
that 
regard,  namely
