"breach  of  the  rule  Audi  Alteram  Partem  and  the  issuance  of  ‘Pe1’  to  evict  him  from  the"
"possession after 21 years from the original decision cannot hold water. The decision in the said"
"inquiry  was pending  in  appeal till 1992  and  thereafter  the  2nd Respondent  appears to  have"
"requested  the  relevant authorities  to enforce  the  decision which  includes the  eviction of the"
"Appellant and handing  over of the  possession to the 2nd Respondent  as per the said decision."
"Possibly, the 2nd Respondent has made an application to the relevant High Court to get the 1 st"
"Respondent  to carry out the public duty entrusted  to the 1st Respondent.  As such, I do not see"
"that  the  Appellant should have been a party to HC 85/2000 as his rights were decided in the"
"aforesaid inquiry which was not disturbed by the appeal made. As said before, neither revision"
"nor  writ application has  been  made  against  it.  As  mentioned  above, it is my  view, till that"
"decision is enforced and he being  evicted from  the paddy land as per the  said decision or he"
"himself 
terminate  his  unlawful  occupancy,  he  cannot  be  lawfully  appointed  as  the  tenant"
"cultivator  of  the  paddy  land  since, firstly,  said decision has  not  clearly indicated  that  S. A."
"Dharmasena  is no  longer the  tenant  cultivator, and  secondly, it is not  clearly shown  that  the"
"Commissioner’s approval has been taken  for that as explained above."
"An application made to get the decision enforced after it was confirmed by the Court of Appeal"
"and the 1st Respondent agreeing in a settlement  before a Court to do his public duty  relating to"
"such decision, cannot  be considered as an act of collusion."
"Anyhow,  non-availability of the application made by the 2nd Respondent to the High Court in"
"application  No.  HC.  85/2000  deprives  this  Court 
to  observe  the  date  and  nature  of  that"
"application. The date is important  as the Agrarian Services Act was repealed on 18.08.2000 by"
"the Agrarian Development  Act No.46 of 2000. HC No. 85/2000 indicates that it was possibly"
"filed in 2000. However, the settlement  took place on 10.01.2002. Thus,  it is not clear whether"
"the  said application was filed when  the  Agrarian  Services Act  was in  force  or after  it  was"
"repealed  through 
the  Agrarian  Development  Act  which  became  the  relevant  law. Without"
"providing this important  information  to  Court,  one  should not  be allowed to argue  a case on"
"how the transitional situation works on the rights of the parties. If this application was filed in"
"HCA 27/2002 writ application filed by the Appellant, which application will be referred to later"
"in this judgment,  it should have been available in the brief. The Petition filed by the Appellant"
"in that  matter  only indicates that  he had filed only some proceedings and documents  relevant"
"to the aforesaid settlement  – vide pages 60, 175 to 183 of the brief."
"However, as indicated above, the 1st Respondent  in view of the settlement  reached in the said"
"High Court application No. HC 85/2000 issued ‘Pe1’ in accordance with the decision in inquiry"
"No.42/3/93 to the Appellant directing him to vacate the paddy land."
