"Among  others, following are the reasons indicated by the learned High Court Judge for the said",""
"dismissal of the Appellant’s application;",""
"","The Appellant was a party to the  inquiry  No. 42/3/93 and in the  decision of the  said"
"","inquiry,  Assistant  Agrarian  Commissioner  had  also come  to the  conclusion  that  the"
"","Appellant should be evicted from the paddy land."
"","The Appellant has not made an appeal against the said order."
"","  When S. A. Dharmasena  made an appeal against the said order, the Appellant has been"
"","made  a party to  that  appeal but  the  appellant has not  challenged  his eviction in that"
"","appeal and further  has not  argued  to indicate that  the  eviction of the  appellant is not"
"","valid which was the argument  made in the said application No. HCA 27/2002."
"","Thus, the decision in the said inquiry which was not changed by the said appeal made"
"","by S. A. Dharmasena has to be considered as a final decision."
"","Even  though 
the  Appellant  had  tendered  a letter  by  which  the  2nd Respondent  has"
"","allegedly accepted the Appellant as the  tenant  cultivator, the  second Respondent  has"
"","not followed the necessary procedures in that regard."
"","However, 
the  order  marked 
‘Pe1’  has  been 
issued 
after 
considering 
all 
the"
"","circumstances."
"","Even though  the relevant law has been changed,  in terms of the sections 99(2) (g) and"
"","7(7)(a) of Agrarian  Development  Act, No.46 of 2000, since the order in inquiry No."
"","42/3/93 is affirmed in appeal, the eviction order issued by the 1st Respondent is legally"
"","valid."
