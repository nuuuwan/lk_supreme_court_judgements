"","It  has  been  filed  to  quash  the  aforesaid  order  marked  ‘Pe1’which  was sent  to  the"
"","appellant after the aforesaid settlement  in HC 85/2000."
"","It is stated in the said petition that said ‘Pe1’ is based on the aforesaid decision in inquiry"
"","No. 42/3/93 where it was decided that  the said S.A Dharmasena,  the  complainant  had"
"","not  been  evicted,  and  when  said  Dharmasena  appealed  against 
it,  the  appeal  was"
"","dismissed. However, as explained above this position had not placed the correct picture,"
"","as explained above what had been decided was that the eviction had not taken place as"
"","alleged on or around  03.05.1981 in the  application to the said inquiry  and eviction of"
"","the  occupier, the  Appellant indirectly indicates that  the  inquiring  officer came  to the"
"","conclusion  that  the  tenant  cultivator, S.A. Dharmasena  has lost the  possession of the"
"","paddy land on someday."
"","The Appellant, in the said petition filed in HCA  27/2002, have further  stated that  the"
"","said inquiry  was held in terms of section 5(3) of the  Agrarian Services Act and if the"
"","decision is that  no eviction has taken  place, Commissioner  has no power to proceed to"
"","evict an  occupier and  only  if  it was decided that  there  was an  eviction that  the  said"
"","Commissioner  has power to evict the  occupier. The  Appellant  has also taken  up the"
"","position that  an appeal is available only  for the  complainant  when  it is decided tha t"
"","there is no eviction and for the landlord when it is decided that  there is eviction; thus,"
"","the Appellant was not the aggrieved party in that inquiry.  In this regard, it is observed"
"","that  it is not  correct to  say  that  Appellant  was not  an  aggrieved  party  as there  was"
"","direction to evict him from  the paddy land. With regard to the stance that the decision"
"","was that there was no eviction, I have commented  above. On the other hand, as stated"
"","above, the Appellant had not  appealed against the said decision. Even if it is taken  as"
"","correct that the Appellant has no right of appeal against said decision in terms of section"
"","5(6) of the  Agrarian Services Act as stated by the  Appellant, being  a party aggrieved"
"","he  could have sought  revisionary remedies against  such  decision, which he  failed to"
"","seek. Anyhow,  the direction to evict the Appellant is based on aforesaid section  11(3)"
"","of the said Act. During  the inquiry,  the  1st Respondent  found  that  transfer of tenancy"
"","rights  through  a deed was invalid and  therefore  the  unlawful  occupier who  came  to"
"","possession as a result  of such  transfer  should  be evicted. The  relevant provisions for"
"","such  direction, as mentioned  above, are sections 11(2) and (3) of the  said Act which"
"","should be read along  with sections 6 and 4(5). The eviction of the Appellant in terms"
"","of those sections were not affected by any manner  due to the decision in appeal. If such"
"","decision  to  evict  the  Appellant  was  irregular,  illogical or  illegal or  ultra  vires,  the"
"","Appellant even could have invoked  writ jurisdiction to quash  such  decision. No such"
"","step was taken and the said decision to evict the Appellant is still a valid decision which"
"","has been confirmed  in appeal."
"","In  the  said  Petition  in  HCA  27/2002,  the  petitioner,  as  mentioned  before,  has  also"
"","averred that not making  him a party to application in HCA 85/2000 violates the rule of"
"","Audi  Alteram partem. I have already commented  over this above. As said before, the"
"","Appellant has not tendered  a copy of the said application along  with the  said petition"
"","for Court to comprehend  the  nature  of the  application. As such,  without  revealing an"
"","important  document 
in  a  writ  application,  the  Appellant  should  not  be  allowed to"
"","support  his case on  that  ground.  On  the  other  hand,  as explained  above, if it was an"
"","application to enforce  the  public duty  entrusted  to the  1st Respondent  to  enforce the"
"","decision made in 42/3/93, the Appellant had the ample opportunity  to present his case"
