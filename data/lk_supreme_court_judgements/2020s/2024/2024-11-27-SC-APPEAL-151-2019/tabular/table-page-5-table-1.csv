"The circumstances  described above indicate that the Appellant did not make an appeal against"
"the decision made in application no.42/3/93 and he was a party Respondent to the appeal made"
"by S.A. Dharmasena  and he did not challenge the said decision even during the said appeal. He"
"neither  sought  revisionary remedy  and/ or writ against  such  decision and  the  decision is still"
"valid. After  said decision was confirmed  by  the  appeal made,  the  decision  which  contains"
"provisions  directing  to  evict  him  from 
the  paddy  land,  has  to  be  considered  as  final  and"
"conclusive.  On  the  other  hand,  the  conduct  of  the  Appellant  with  regard to  the  decision in"
"application  No.42/3/93  establishes 
that  he  has  acquiesced  with 
the  decision  of 
the  1st"
"Respondent,  the  Assistant  Agrarian  Commissioner,  although  he  now seeks  to  challenge  the"
"enforcement  of the same  through  different  action as explained later in this judgment  without"
"any  application to vacate or quash  the relevant part, namely  the  decision to evict him,  in the"
"said decision. In  fact,  as the  1st  Respondent  found  that  the  transfer  of  tenancy  rights  of the"
"tenant  cultivator  through 
the  said deed  is invalid.  He  had  power in  terms  of  the  Agrarian"
"Services Act to evict the Occupier, the Appellant- vide section 11, especially section 11(3) of"
"the Agrarian Services Act. Sections 6 and 4(5) of the said Act were relevant in such situations."
"The  Appellant, 
in  his  petition  claims 
that, 
a  few  days 
following 
the 
issuance  of 
the"
"aforementioned  decision dated 01.07.1982, the 2nd Respondent  applied to the  1st Respondent"
"to appoint the Appellant as the tenant  cultivator of the abovementioned  paddy land- vide letter"
"dated 11.08.1982 found  at page 168 of the brief. The  Appellant further  claims in his Petition"
"that  the  investigation  into  the  abovementioned  application was not  proceeded on the  ground"
"that  an appeal had been filed against  the  aforesaid decision dated 01.07.1982, and that  it was"
"postponed indefinitely, as evinced by the document  marked  P2(e). (Vide paragraphs 6,7 and 8"
"of the Petition dated 22.02.2016. Also see document  filed at page 165 of the brief). However,"
"it appears that the 2nd Respondent denied the said letter dated 11.08.1982."
"As said before, the  said decision dated 01.07.1982 clearly indicated that  transfer of  tenancy"
"rights by S. A. Dharmasena  through  the said deed No.1358 is not valid. Further, there is a clear"
"indication in that decision that S.A. Dharmasena was the tenant cultivator on or around the time"
"of  the  alleged removal  referred to  in  the  application relevant  to  the  said decision and,  said"
"decision provided a clear direction to evict the Appellant from the said paddy land. Whatever"
"the  positions taken  by the  2nd Respondent  (landlord) or his predecessor Nandawathie  before"
"the  said decision,  including  during  the  relevant  inquiry,  accepting  the  Appellant  as  tenant"
"cultivator  has no  relevance as such  positions has been  clearly defeated  by  the  said decision"
"which  was not  changed  in  appeal made  against  it, nor  yet  vacated  or quashed  through  any"
"revision or writ application.  Thus,  during  the  pendency  of  appeal against  the  said decision,"
"appointing the Appellant as the tenant  cultivator as alleged by the Appellant, would have been"
"in direct conflict with the said decision as he cannot be appointed as the tenant cultivator before"
"evicting him from  or terminating  his unlawful  occupancy.  On the other hand,  when read with"
"sections 11(2), (3), 6 and 4(5) of the said Agrarian Services Act, he cannot be appointed as the"
"tenant  cultivator without  the  approval of the  Commissioner  of Agrarian  Services. However,"
"not proceeding with the  alleged application of the 2nd Respondent  to appoint the Appellant as"
"aforesaid, appears to  be a  prudent  decision as the  decision in  appeal was pending  over the"
"decision dated 01.07.1982. On the other hand, when the 2nd Respondent refute the alleged letter"
"dated 11.08.1982, I do not think  any authority  can direct to commence  or proceed with such an"
"inquiry based on that letter, as the purported author denies the said letter."
