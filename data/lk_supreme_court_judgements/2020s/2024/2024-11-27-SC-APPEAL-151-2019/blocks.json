Furthermore, despite an appeal being filed by said S. A. Dharmasena, the complainant before the Commissioner, and the Appellant being named as a Respondent before the Court of Appeal, the Appellant still failed to challenge the decision successfully as a party to the Appeal. One may argue that the Appellant cannot appeal against the said decision in terms of section 5(3) of the Agrarian Services Act but he being an aggrieved party had not sought any revisionary remedy or writ against such decision and still such decision is valid against him. It must also be noted that decision in aforesaid application No.42/3/93 was made on 01.07.1982. As per section 5(6) of the Agrarian Services Act of 1979 which prevailed at that time, where no appeal was made from a decision of the Commissioner within the time allowed such decision shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any Court or tribunal. (This section later had been amended by Act No. 4 of 1991, to make provision to submit the appeal to Agrarian Board of Review instead of Court of Appeal. However, the final and conclusive effect remain the same when there was no appeal. It is also observed that Agrarian Services Act was later repealed by the Agrarian Development Act, No. 46 of 2000 which also in section 7(3) to (6) made provisions for inquiries and appeals as well as finality effect for decisions when there is no appeal. However, notwithstanding the said repeal of Agrarian Services Act, section 99(2) of the Agrarian Development Act provides for transitional situations. However, the decision in application no.42/3/93 dated 01.07.1982 as well as the Judgment in C.A. 470/82 on the appeal made by S.A Dharmasena took place during the time Agrarian Services Act was in force.).",

Dharmasena was the tenant cultivator on or around the time of the alleged removal referred to in the application relevant to the said decision and, said decision provided a clear direction to evict the Appellant from the said paddy land. Whatever the positions taken by the 2nd Respondent (landlord) or his predecessor Nandawathie before the said decision, including during the relevant inquiry, accepting the Appellant as tenant cultivator has no relevance as such positions has been clearly defeated by the said decision which was not changed in appeal made against it, nor yet vacated or quashed through any revision or writ application. Thus, during the pendency of appeal against the said decision, appointing the Appellant as the tenant cultivator as alleged by the Appellant, would have been in direct conflict with the said decision as he cannot be appointed as the tenant cultivator before evicting him from or terminating his unlawful occupancy. On the other hand, when read with sections 11(2), (3), 6 and 4(5) of the said Agrarian Services Act, he cannot be appointed as the tenant cultivator without the approval of the Commissioner of Agrarian Services.

It must also be noted that said decision in the inquiry No.42/3/93 had not clearly indicated that S.A. Dharmasena is no longer the tenant cultivator.

The Appellant alleges that on the strength of the said settlement (found at pages 175 to 176 of the brief) entered in the said application HC 85/2000, the 1st Respondent issued the letter marked Pe1(found at page 70 of the brief) directing him to vacate the subject matter after 21 years of the said order dated 01.07.82. In the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant, it is also alleged that he was not made a party to the said application and therefore settlement order made in that application was made in breach of the rule udi alteram partem. However, it has to be said that a copy of the application in HC 85/2000 is not among the documents found in the brief indicating that the Appellant has not filed a copy of the said application along with his writ application in HC 27/2002 which application will be referred to later in this judgment. Thus, this Court does not have the ability to perceive the nature of the application in HC 85/2000 made to the High Court by perusing the application itself. However, the submissions made by the 2nd Respondent in this regard indicate that through the settlement, the 1st Respondent agreed to carry out his public duty which in turn indicates that the application made to the High Court HC 85/2000 would have been a writ application praying for orders in the nature of Mandamus. The documents found in the brief along with the said settlement in HC 85/2000 as part of said case record at pages 175 to 183, indicate that there had been request letters written to the 1st Respondent in 1997 by the 2nd Respondent to enforce the decision in inquiry No.42/3/93 which was confirmed after the decision of Court of Appeal application No. CA 470/82. Said Court of Appeal decision was delivered in 1992 and the Appellant had full opportunity to place his case before the inquiry as well as before the Court of Appeal. Thus, the Appellants position that he was not heard in",

The decision in the said inquiry was pending in appeal till 1992 and thereafter the 2nd Respondent appears to have requested the relevant authorities to enforce the decision which includes the eviction of the Appellant and handing over of the possession to the 2nd Respondent as per the said decision. Possibly, the 2nd Respondent has made an application to the relevant High Court to get the 1st Respondent to carry out the public duty entrusted to the 1st Respondent.

The Appellant has also taken up the position that an appeal is available only for the complainant when it is decided that there is no eviction and for the landlord when it is decided that there is eviction; thus, the Appellant was not the aggrieved party in that inquiry. In this regard, it is observed that it is not correct to say that Appellant was not an aggrieved party as there was direction to evict him from the paddy land. With regard to the stance that the decision was that there was no eviction, I have commented above. On the other hand, as stated above, the Appellant had not appealed against the said decision. Even if it is taken as correct that the Appellant has no right of appeal against said decision in terms of section 5(6) of the Agrarian Services Act as stated by the Appellant, being a party aggrieved he could have sought revisionary remedies against such decision, which he failed to seek. Anyhow, the direction to evict the Appellant is based on aforesaid section 11(3) of the said Act. During the inquiry, the 1st Respondent found that transfer of tenancy rights through a deed was invalid and therefore the unlawful occupier who came to possession as a result of such transfer should be evicted. The relevant provisions for such direction, as mentioned above, are sections 11(2) and (3) of the said Act which should be read along with sections 6 and 4(5). The eviction of the Appellant in terms of those sections were not affected by any manner due to the decision in appeal. If such decision to evict the Appellant was irregular, illogical or illegal or ultra vires, the Appellant even could have invoked writ jurisdiction to quash such decision. No such step was taken and the said decision to evict the Appellant is still a valid decision which has been confirmed in appeal.

As said before, finding was that it was not proved that S. A. Dharmasena, the tenant cultivator was evicted as alleged by him and however, that the paddy land has come into the hands of an unlawful occupier, namely the Appellant. Appellant had not challenged the said decision to evict him from the paddy land during the Appeal or if he has no right to appeal as averred, through any other means. On the other hand, as mentioned before, eviction of the Appellant had been decided in terms of sections 11(2) and (3) of the Agrarian Services Act which should be read along with sections 6 and 4(5) of the said Act which was within the power of the 1st Respondent who inquired into the matter. It is true that when Pe1 was issued after the aforesaid settlement in HC 85/2000, the Act in force was the Agrarian Development Act. Most probably, the said Application in HC 85/2000 would have been filed to enforce the public duty entrusted to the 1st Respondent in terms of the said Agrarian Services Act, and therefore it would have been proceeded after the repeal of the said Act and issued the said Pe1 in terms of the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act. Section 99(2) (g) of the Agrarian Development Act provides for such situation and thus, the proceedings with said application HC85/2000 and reaching a settlement and issuance of Pe1 appears to be lawful. However, as explained above, the application in HC 85/2000 had not been annexed to the said application in HCA 27/2002 and, therefore it cannot be observed whether it was an application filed after the enactment of Agrarian development Act. If that application was filed after the enactment of Agrarian development Act, I see the possibility of forming an argument that the said Act has no provision to enforce decisions or orders made by the previous Act since the orders referred to in section 99(2)(h) seems to be the orders made in terms of section 95 of the said Act and Section (20) (e) (f) and (g) seem to be relevant to the pending actions which are not concluded.

Whether their Lordships of the Court of Appeal as well as the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Hambantota have failed to appreciate the fact that in the circumstances of this case and specially due to his own conduct the 2nd Respondent was estopped in law from seeking to eject the Petitioner after the expiry of more than 20 years from the order dated 01/07/1982 and thereby erred in law?",

Thus, it has not taken 20 years from that judgment. After the said judgment in appeal the 2nd Respondent appears to have requested the 1st Respondent to evict the Appellant as per the said decision and later have appeared to file an application in the high court to get the 1st Respondent to do his public duty in terms of the said decision.",
