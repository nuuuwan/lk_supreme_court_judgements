"11.","The  nature  of  damages  awarded  against  a 
co-defendant 
is"
"","compensatory, not punitive. The measure of damage is based upon"
"","two considerations."
"","I. The actual value of the wife to the husband."
"","II. The  proper  compensation  to  him  for  the  injury  to  his"
"","feelings,  the  blow  to  his  honour,  and  the  hurt  to  his"

"12.","In the instant case, the learned District Judge has given good and"
"","sufficient  reasons  for  her  conclusion  that  the  co-defendant  has"
"","committed adultery with the plaintiff. The learned trial Judge has"
"","also  given  reasons  for  deciding  on  the  quantum  of  damages  as"
"","compensatory, not punitive. The issue before this Court is whether"
"","the  defendant  could  claim  damages  against 
the  co-defendant"
"","without praying for a divorce, on the ground of adultery."
"13.  The","evidence 
revealed 
that 
the  marriage  has  broken  down"
"","irrevocably. The plaintiff sought divorce on the ground of desertion"
"","by  the  defendant.  It  is  the  position  of  the  defendant  that  the"
"","marriage has broken down not due to him deserting the wife, but"
"","because  of  the  adulterous  conduct  of  the  plaintiff  and  the  co-"
"","defendant.  On  that  basis,  the  defendant  sought  to  add  the  co-"
"","defendant as a party and claimed damages from the co-defendant."
"","However,  although  the  defendant  prayed  for  a  dismissal  of  the"
"","plaintiffâ€™s claim for divorce, he did not pray for divorce on the ground"
"","of  adultery  between  the  plaintiff  and  the  co-defendant  as  he  has"
"","alleged."
"14.  As I have mentioned before, the learned District Judge has analyzed",""
"","the  evidence  placed  before  her  on  the  issue  of  adultery.  If  the"
"","adultery can be proved, the defendant has a clear cause of action"
"","against the co-defendant for loss of consortium of his wife (plaintiff)"
"","and the injuria caused to him. The issue that must be addressed is"
"","whether  that  cause  of  action  can  be  joined  in  the  same  action"
"","without  him  seeking  a  divorce?    Whether  there  is  a  misjoinder  of"
"","causes of action?"
