"","cannot  claim  damages 
from 
the  co-defendant 
for  committing"

"","seeking damages without disclosing a cause of action known to the"
"","law of this country. The learned Counsel further submitted that, as"

the

learned  Counsel  also  relied  on  the  case  of"
"","Senadipathi V. Senadipathi 43 NLR 272 in this aspect."

"","this case that, the defendant is entitled to file action for damages"
"","against  the  co-defendant  without  praying 
for  divorce 
from  the"
"","plaintiff, due to the loss of consortium caused by the co-defendant"
"","by committing adultery with the plaintiff. The learned Counsel relied"

"","have taken the view that the standard of proof required to establish"
"","adultery  to  be  of  proof  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  Adultery  is  a"
"","ground  for  divorce  and  the  aggrieved  spouse  may  claim  damages"
"","against the co-defendant."
