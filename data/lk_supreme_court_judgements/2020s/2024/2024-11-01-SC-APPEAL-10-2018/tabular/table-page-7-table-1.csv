"","Sri.  L.R.  25.  In  that  case  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the"
"","provisions  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  relating  to  the  joinder  of"
"","causes  of  action  and  parties  are  rules  of  procedure  and  not"
"","substantive law. Court should adopt a common-sense approach in"
"","deciding questions of misjoinder or non-joinder."
"16.","In the case of Adlin Fernando (supra), His Lordship Ranaraja J. with"
"","S.N. Silva J. agreeing said;"
"","“What  is of importance however  is,  that  the provisions of the"
"","Civil Procedure Code relating to the joinder of causes of action and"
"","parties, are rules of procedure and not substantive law. It follows,"
"","that Courts should  adopt  a common-sense  approach in deciding"
"","questions of misjoinder or non-joinder. … Section 36 provides, if"
"","any  cause  of  action  cannot  be  conveniently  tried  or  disposed  of"
"","together,  for  Court  to  ex  mero  motu  or  on  the  applications  of"
"","defendants  with  notice  to  the  plaintiff,  at  any  time  before  the"
"","hearing, or on agreement of the parties after the commencement"
"","of the hearing, to order separate trials of any causes of actions.”"
"17.  According to his stance, in the instant case, the defendant needs to",""
"","provide  evidence  of  adultery  between  the  plaintiff  and  the  co-"
"","defendant in order to support and secure his claim, that it was the"
"","plaintiff’s adultery with the co-defendant, and not his desertion that"
"","caused the breakdown of the marriage.  If the argument of the co-"
"","defendant is to be accepted, even after proving adultery in this case,"
"","the defendant will have to file another action for damages based on"
"","adultery, where he would be required to prove adultery once again."
"18.  Our Courts have repeatedly held that Courts should effectively and",""
"","completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in"
"","an action to avoid multiplicity of cases and to diminish the cost of"
"","litigation.  Therefore,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  the  cause  of"
"","action for damages by the defendant against the co-defendant could"
"","be  joined  in  this  action  without  causing  prejudice  to  any  of  the"
"","parties."
"19.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  co-defendant  relied  on  the  case  of",""
"","Premanie Samarasinghe V. Leelaraja Samarasinghe [1990] 1"
"","Sri  L.R.  page  31.  This  is  a  case  where  the  husband  filed  action"
"","against the wife for separation. The defendant (wife) while seeking"
"","for a dismissal of the plaintiff’s action, sought as relief, the legal title"
"","of 
the  house  and  property  and  also 
for  movable  properties"
