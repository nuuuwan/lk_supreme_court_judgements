"1.","The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the"
"","Plaintiff)  filed  action  in  the  District  Court  of  Hatton  against  the"
"","Defendant-Respondent-Respondent  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the"
"","Defendant) for divorce on the ground of malicious desertion by the"
"","defendant. The plaintiff also prayed for permanent alimony and the"
"","custody  of  the  two  children.  The  plaintiff 
is  the  wife  and  the"
"","defendant is the husband."
"2.","In his amended answer, the defendant while denying the malicious"
"","desertion on his part prayed for a dismissal of the plaintiff’s action,"
"","and  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  is  committing  adultery  with  the  Co-"
"","defendant-Appellant-Appellant  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  co-"
"","defendant)  and  claimed  Rs.  1,000,000  as  damages  from  the  co-"
"","defendant for breaking down his marriage. It was the position of the"
"","defendant that the plaintiff has filed this action in order to obtain a"
"","divorce as she is living in adultery with the co-defendant. However,"
"","it is pertinent to note that, the defendant did not pray for divorce"
"","from  the  plaintiff  based  on  the  alleged  adultery.  For  the  ease  of"
"","reference, I will refer to the parties as they were referred to in the"
"","District Court."

"","in Kandy."
"5.","The learned Judges of the High Court, after hearing the appeal, by"

"","against  the  said  judgment  of  the  High  Court  from  the  Supreme"
"","Court. This Court, after considering the application, granted leave"
"","to appeal on the following question of law:"
