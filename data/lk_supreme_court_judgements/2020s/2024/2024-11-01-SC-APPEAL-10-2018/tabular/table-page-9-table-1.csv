"","collusion  which  he  will  have 
to  be  prepared 
to  meet  by"
"","satisfactory evidence.”"
"","The above passage refers to cases of Viviers V. Kilian, 1927 A.D."
"","449 and Biccard V. Biccard and Fryer, 9 S.C. 473."
"22.","In case of Viviers V. Kilian (supra), His Lordship Solomon C.J. held"
"","that  on  principle  there  is  no  reason  for  holding  that,  because  a"
"","husband condones his wife’s misconduct he thereby loses his right"
"","of  proceeding  against 
the  person  who  has 
injured  him  by"
"","committing adultery with her. However, that may mitigate damages."
"23.  The  cause  of  action  against  the  co-defendant  is  for  damages  for",""
"","injuria caused to the defendant by loss of consortium from his wife."
"","Although the defendant opts not to seek divorce against the plaintiff,"
"","there is no reason why the defendant cannot proceed with the cause"
"","of action against the co-defendant for the injuria caused to him in"
"","the  same  action.  Whether  there  is  collusion  between  the  plaintiff"
"","and  the  defendant  against  the  co-defendant  has  to  be  decided  on"
"","the  evidence  adduced  in  the  case,  no  such  evidence  is  present  in"
"","the instant case as the marriage has been irrevocably broken down"
"","and  the  action  for  divorce  has  been  filed  by  the  plaintiff.  For  the"
"","reasons  stated  in  paragraphs  14-18  of  this  judgment,  there  is  no"
"","misjoinder of causes of action by claiming damages for injuria by"
"","the  defendant  as 
the  marriage  between 
the  plaintiff  and 
the"
"","defendant has been broken down due to the adulterous conduct of"
"","the co-defendant and the plaintiff."
"24.  Section 603 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for the defendant",""
"","in a matrimonial action for dissolution of marriage, to oppose the"
"","relief  sought  by  the  plaintiff  on  any  ground  which  would  have"
"","enabled him to sue the plaintiff for such dissolution. The Court may"
"","in  such  action,  give  to  the  defendant  in  his  application  the  same"
"","relief  he  would  have  asked  for  and  be  entitled  to,  as  if  he  has"
"","presented a plaint seeking such relief."
"25.","In the instant case, the defendant has opposed the action filed by"
"","plaintiff on the ground of desertion, stating that the alleged adultery"
"","has caused the breakdown of the marriage. I do not see any reason"
"","why  the  defendant  cannot  proceed  against  the  co-defendant  for"
"","damages 
caused 
to  him  by 
injuria,  without  proceeding 
for"
"","dissolution of the marriage in the same action. As I have mentioned"
