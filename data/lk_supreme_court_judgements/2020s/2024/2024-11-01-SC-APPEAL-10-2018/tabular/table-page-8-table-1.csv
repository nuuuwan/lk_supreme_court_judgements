"","mentioned  therein  from  the  plaintiff  husband.  Court  held  that,"
"","where  the  wife  has  not  put  matrimonial  fault  of  her  husband  in"
"","issue,  she  cannot  seek  settlement  of  property  on  the  basis  of"
"","forfeiture of benefits. Court held further, that the defendant has not"
"","put matrimonial fault of the spouse and therefore she is not entitled"
"","to such relief. Without praying for a divorce or separation, the wife"
"","could not seek settlement of property on the basis of forfeiture of"
"","benefits.  The  instant  application  is  not  against  the  spouse,  but"
"","against  the  co-defendant  who  caused  injuria  to  the  husband  by"
"","committing adultery with his wife. Therefore,  Premanie(supra) has"
"no application to this case.",""
"20.  The learned Counsel for the co-defendant also relied on the case of",""
"","Senadipathi(supra). In that case, the wife filed divorce action against"
"","the husband. The husband also claimed a divorce against the wife"
"","on  the  ground  of  adultery  with  the  co-defendant  from  whom  he"
"","claimed  Rs.  10,000  as  damages.  Apart  from  that,  the  husband"
"","further claimed Rs. 7,073 from the plaintiff on three other causes of"
"","action. They are for the articles damaged by her, plaintiff’s share for"
"","improving the land and for some rubber coupons appropriated by"
"","her without the defendant’s consent. Court held that, the causes of"
"","action other than the Rs.10,000 for damages from the co-defendant"
"","cannot be introduced in a matrimonial action. In the instant case,"
"","the  defendant  has  included  the  cause  of  action  for  damages  from"
"","the co-defendant, and not against the plaintiff, which he is entitled"
"to","in  a  matrimonial  action.  Hence,  Senadipathy(supra)  has  no"
"","application to the instant case."
"21.  Maasdorp’s Institutes of South African Law Volume IV, has discussed",""
"","the issue of filing separate action for damages against the adulterer"
"","without filing action against the spouse for divorce."
