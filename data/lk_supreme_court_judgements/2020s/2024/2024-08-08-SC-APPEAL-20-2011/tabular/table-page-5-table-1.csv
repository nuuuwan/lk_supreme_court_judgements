"eject 
the  Original  Defendant.  The  Learned  District  Judge  dismissed 
the  said  action  on 
the"
"premise that the parties were bound by the settlement  dated 15.08.1975."
"The Current  Case- DC Case No. 4147/ZL"
"Notwithstanding 
the 
aforesaid 
settlement,  N.M.  Bandaratilake, 
the  mother  of 
the  Plaintiff"
"Respondent,  transferred  the  said  premises  to  the  Plaintiff  by  Deed  No.  931  dated  25.06.1981."
"Both  N.M.  Bandaratilake  and  C.O.L.B.  Bandaratilake 
(Father  and  Mother  of 
the  Plaintiff"
"Respondent),  thereafter  called  upon  the  original  Defendant  to  attorn to and  pay him the rent for"
"the  premises  by  letter  dated  23.11.1981.  The  original  Defendant  did  not  comply  with  the  said"
"demands 
and  was 
consequently 
served  with  notice 
to  quit  on  22.03.1982.  The  Plaintiff"
"Respondent  subsequently  instituted  a  fresh  action  against  the  original Defendant by plaint dated"
"09.05.1982  which  was  given 
the  case  No.  4147/ZL.  Answer  was  filed  on  02.02.1983,  the"
"Plaintiff  Respondent's  replication  was  filed  on  16.03.1983  and  the  matter  proceeded  to  trial"
"thereafter.  Learned  District  Judge  entered 
the  Judgment  dated  27.04.1989 
in  favour  of 
the"
"Plaintiff  Respondent  and  granted  the  reliefs  prayed  for.  Subsequently,  it  was  appealed  to  the"
"Court  of  Appeal  (CA  Case  No.  269/89F)  by  the  original  Defendant. 
  The  Court  of  Appeal"
"observed that the learned District Judge was in error in failing to consider the bindi ng nature of"
"the  settlement  in DC case No. 2280/RE and the consequences that flowed from the dismissal of"
"DC  case  No.  3004/RE.  The  Court  of Appeal  further  stated  in  its  judgment  that  in  terms  of  the"
"aforesaid settlement and the decree entered in case No.2280/RE, the Original Defendant had the"
"right 
to  continue 
to  be 
in  occupation  of 
the  premises  till  the  Plaintiff  Respondent’s  mother"
"conveys  the property to the Original Defendant.  Moreover, it was said in the said  Judgment that"
"the Plaintiff Respondent’s mother had not only failed to carry out the pledge given on her behalf"
"by  her  husband  to  Court  but  also  fraudulently  transferred  the  property  to  her  son,  the  Plaintiff"
"Respondent,  in  defiance  of  the  undertaking  and  Court  would  not  countenance  such  conduct  or"
"grant relief to those who claim rights through such miscreants as doing so would only encourage"
"the  abuse  of  the  process  of  Court. 
  Thus,  the  Court  of  Appeal  reversed  the  judgment  of  the"
"District Court  by its judgment dated 20.12.1996. The Plaintiff Respondent appealed to this Court"
"and  this  Court  upheld  the  Court  of  Appeal  judgment  by  its  judgment  dated  21.10.2003  in  SC"
"Appeal  No.  83/97.  While  dismissing  the  appeal,  this  Court  in  the  final  paragraph  of  the  said"
"judgment  stated as follows;"
"“We  award  the  substituted  defendants-respondents  costs  in  a  sum  of  Rs.30,000/-  in  all  three"
"courts payable on or before 1.3.2004. However, if the substituted defendants-respondents tender"
"a deed of transfer at their expense on or before 31.12.2003 reciting as consideration the sum of"
"Rs.  70,000/-  already  deposited-  the  draft  deed  to  be  approved  by  Court  if  disputed  by  the"
"plaintiff-appellant- and if the plaintiff appellant executes the transfer on or before 28.02.2004, no"
"cost would be payable.” (highlighted  by me)"
"The  Petitioner  along  with 
the  other  substituted  Defendant  Respondent  by 
the  motion  dated"
"04.03.2008 marked A12 tendered a draft deed and moved Court to approve the draft deed and get"
"it  signed  by  the Plaintiff Respondent. As mentioned before, since  it was not tendered within the"
"time  limit  which  was  quoted  above,  the  District  Judge  refused the said application and as said"
