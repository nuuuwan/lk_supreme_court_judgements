"the authority of the plaintiff-appellant's father extended to dealing with the possession of the"
"property, it did not extend to disposing of the title thereto."
"Where a settlement deals with a subject matter different to or more extensive than the subject"
"matter  of the suit and affects the rights of a third party, it is desirable that the Court should"
"obtain an unequivocal manifestation of that third party's consent if the parties are to be bound by"
"the settlement."
"Although  the plaintiff-appellant's father was not the agent of his mother in relation to the"
"alienation of the property, he was nevertheless her agent in relation to the possession of the"
"property. Thus, the settlement was binding on the father and the mother, as the principal, in"
"relation  to  the  payment  of  the  arrears  of  rent  and  damages  and  the  right  to  remain  in"
"possession. Having complied with the terms of settlement in regard to the deposit of the money,"
"the defendant-respondent and his successors in title became entitled to remain in possession of"
"the premises indefinitely and he was no longer a tenant. His refusal to attorn to the plaintiff-"
"appellant is therefore irrelevant. Further, the plaintiff-appellant's mother had the paper title to"
"the  property  subject 
to 
the  right  of 
the  defendant-respondent 
to  remain 
in  occupation"
"indefinitely  without  making  any  further  payment.  The  gift  of  the  property  to  the plaintiff -"
"appellant from his mother did not give him greater rights than that which his mother had."
"We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and hold that the father of the plaintiff -"
"appellant acted as the agent of his mother to the limited extent as explained above in relation to"
"the possession of the property.” (highlighted  by me)"
"Thus, 
in  relation 
to 
the  settlement  entered, 
the  Supreme  Court  recognized 
the  father  of  the"
"Plaintiff Respondent as the agent of the Plaintiff Respondent’s mother to deal with the possession"
"of  the  property  but  not  with  regard  to  the  title.  In  fact,  by  giving  the  property  on  rent  to  the"
"original Defendant as the landlord  on behalf of the mother of the Plaintiff Respondent, it is clear"
"that  the  father  of  the  Plaintiff  Respondent  had  ostensible  authority  to  act  as  the  agent  of  the"
"mother  of  the  Plaintiff  Respondent  in  relation  to  the  possession  of  the  property.  However,  as"
"recognized by the Supreme Court, the father of the Plaintiff  Respondent did not have authority to"
"enter  into  an  agreement  with  regard  to  the  title  of  the  property  but  as  far  as  the  possession  is"
"concerned  there  is  a  valid  agreement  between  the parties that empowers the original Defendant"
"and his successors to remain in property indefinitely as he has fulfilled the terms of settlement as"
"agreed.  Therefore,  the  Plaintiff  Respondent’s  mother  had  only  paper  title  and  anyone  who  gets"
"title  through  her  cannot  have  better  title 
than  her.  Thus,  no  right  to  get  back  the  possession."
"Hence, 
the  Supreme  Court  has  observed 
this  anomalous  situation  created  by 
the  settlement"
"between  the  predecessors  of  the  Plaintiff  Respondent  and  the  original  Defendant.  It  is  in  that"
"background  one  should  understand  the  final  paragraph  of  the  Supreme  Court  judgment  which"
"was quoted previously in this Judgment."
"Thus,  the  losing  party,  the  Plaintiff  Respondent  was  ordered  to  pay  Rs.30,000/-  as  costs of all"
"three  Courts.  This  was  almost  a  half  of 
the  consideration 
that 
the  Plaintiff  Respondent’s"
"predecessors  got  in  view  of  the  terms  of  settlement.  It  appears  that  to  iron  out  the  anomalous"
"situation  created  by  the  settlement  of  parties,  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  aforesaid  judgment  has"
