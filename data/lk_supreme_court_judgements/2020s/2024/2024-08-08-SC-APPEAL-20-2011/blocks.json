Both N.M. Bandaratilake and C.O.L.B. Bandaratilake (Father and Mother of the Plaintiff Respondent), thereafter called upon the original Defendant to attorn to and pay him the rent for the premises by letter dated 23.11.1981. The original Defendant did not comply with the said demands and was consequently served with notice to quit on 22.03.1982. The Plaintiff Respondent subsequently instituted a fresh action against the original Defendant by plaint dated 09.05.1982 which was given the case No. 4147/ZL. Answer was filed on 02.02.1983, the Plaintiff Respondent's replication was filed on 16.03.1983 and the matter proceeded to trial thereafter. Learned District Judge entered the Judgment dated 27.04.1989 in favour of the Plaintiff Respondent and granted the reliefs prayed for. Subsequently, it was appealed to the Court of Appeal (CA Case No. 269/89F) by the original Defendant. The Court of Appeal observed that the learned District Judge was in error in failing to consider the binding nature of the settlement in DC case No. 2280/RE and the consequences that flowed from the dismissal of DC case No. 3004/RE. The Court of Appeal further stated in its judgment that in terms of the aforesaid settlement and the decree entered in case No.2280/RE, the Original Defendant had the right to continue to be in occupation of the premises till the Plaintiff Respondents mother conveys the property to the Original Defendant. Moreover, it was said in the said Judgment that the Plaintiff Respondents mother had not only failed to carry out the pledge given on her behalf by her husband to Court but also fraudulently transferred the property to her son, the Plaintiff Respondent, in defiance of the undertaking and Court would not countenance such conduct or grant relief to those who claim rights through such miscreants as doing so would only encourage the abuse of the process of Court. Thus, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the District Court by its judgment dated 20.12.1996. The Plaintiff Respondent appealed to this Court and this Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment by its judgment dated 21.10.2003 in SC Appeal No. 83/97.

However, as recognized by the Supreme Court, the father of the Plaintiff Respondent did not have authority to enter into an agreement with regard to the title of the property but as far as the possession is concerned there is a valid agreement between the parties that empowers the original Defendant and his successors to remain in property indefinitely as he has fulfilled the terms of settlement as agreed. Therefore, the Plaintiff Respondents mother had only paper title and anyone who gets title through her cannot have better title than her. Thus, no right to get back the possession.

As such, there is no possibility to force the Plaintiff Respondent to execute a deed of transfer which conveys the title. If the draft deed was tendered in time the Plaintiff Respondent could have considered it and opted to execute the transfer deed accordingly within time stated in the supreme Court judgment. As per the decision of the Supreme Court the settlement was valid with regard to the possession. Thus, the transfer of the title instead of paying costs ordered appears to be an option. By the time the Petitioner tendered the draft, the time given by the Supreme Court to use such option has lapsed resulting that the Plaintiff Respondent is now bound to pay costs ordered by the Supreme Court in its judgment dated 21.10.2003. Hence, considering the draft after the time given by the Supreme Court and approving it would not change the situation and make the execution of deed enforceable by using Courts authority.
