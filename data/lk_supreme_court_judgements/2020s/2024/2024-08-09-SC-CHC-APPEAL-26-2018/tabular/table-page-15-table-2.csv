"Lordship Justice Aluwihare in Chandra Gunasekara v. Peoples’ Bank17 as has been"
"reproduced below."
"“What  was  produced  in  Court  in  the  case  of  Agostinu  was  a  bare"
"statement,  without  any  certification,  and  based  on  some  entries"
"which had been certified by the accountant of the bank. It appears,"
"then, that although the original entries of the bank had been certified by"
"the accountant, the transcription of those entries that was produced"
"in Court carried no certification. Basnayake C.J. correctly held that the"
"statement was inadmissible in as much as it is a mandatory requirement"
"under Section 90C, that what is produced in Court should be certified as"
"stipulated in Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance.”"
