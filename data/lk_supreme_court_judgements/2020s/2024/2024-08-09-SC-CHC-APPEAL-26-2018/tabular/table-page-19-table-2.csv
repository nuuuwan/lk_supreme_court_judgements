"to raise contradictory evidence at trial, and am inclined to agree with the following"
"statement."
"“I also must point out that the Appellant raised no objection when the"
"document was sought to be admitted in evidence by the Plaintiff Bank,"
"when  witness  Mohamed  testified.  Furthermore,  every  party  if  it  is  so"
"desired  is  afforded  an  opportunity  to  have  the  originals  inspected,  in"
"terms  of  Section  90E  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  which  right  the"
"Appellant could have exercised before the trial Judge."
"I am also of the view that this is a fit instance to apply the principle laid"
"down in the case of L. Edrick De Silva v L. Chandradasa De Silva, 70"
"NLR 169. In the said case (at page 174) Chief Justice H.N.G Fernando"
"held:“But where the plaintiff has in a civil case led evidence sufficient in"
"law  to  prove  a  factum  probandum,  the  failure  of  the  defendant  to"
"adduce evidence which contradicts it adds a new factor in favour of the"
"plaintiff. There is then an additional “matter before the Court”, which"
"the definition in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the Court"
"to  take  into  account,  namely  that  the  evidence  led  by  the  plaintiff  is"
"uncontradicted.”"
