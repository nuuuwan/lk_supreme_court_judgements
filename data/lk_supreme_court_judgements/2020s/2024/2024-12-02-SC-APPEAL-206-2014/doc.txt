Introduction

Beer made from malt became an excisable article within the meaning of

section 3 of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989, as

amended, by virtue of Gazette Extraordinary No. 1052/15 dated

05.11.1998. Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC, the appellant, is a manufacturer

of beer. This appeal relates to the unpaid excise duty on beer for the 4th

quarter of 1998, the 1st to 4th quarters of 1999, the 4th quarter of 2000,

4

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001, and the 1st quarter of 2002. The

appellant was unsuccessful in the Court of Appeal, where they challenged

the calculation of the relevant excise duty by the Director of Excise Duty

Division of Sri Lanka Customs, the respondent. This appeal arises from

the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 07.08.2013. As crystallized

during the argument before this Court, the appeal centers on three main

issues:

(a) Should the excise duty for the beer sold be calculated based on the

ex-factory price or the wholesale price?

(b) Has a determination under section 9(2) of the Excise (Special

Provisions) Act been duly made on the facts and circumstances of

this case?

(c) Should the appellant pay excise duty for complimentary beer?

Calculation of excise duty

There is no dispute that the appellant became liable to pay 10% as excise

duty on the value of the beer produced by it, as determined in

accordance with section 7 of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act read with

the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1052/15 dated 05.11.1998. The issue lies

in the method of determining the value of the beer for the purpose of

calculating the excise duty. The answer to this question is found within

section 7 of the Act itself. Section 7(1)(a), insofar as relevant to the issue

at hand reads as follows:

Where under this Act, excise duty is levied on any excisable article,

not being an excisable article imported into Sri Lanka, with reference

to value, such value shall be deemed to be the normal price thereof,

that is to say, the price at which such excisable articles are ordinarily

sold by an assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for

5

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

delivery at the time and place of removal, where the buyer is not a

related person and the price is the sole consideration of sale.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant is that, in

terms of section 7(1)(a), the value of the beer for the purpose of

calculation of the excise duty is the normal price, which is the price at

which the beer is sold from the factory to the buyer (identified by the

appellant as the ex-factory price), not the wholesale price at which the

buyer subsequently sells the beer to the retailer. The appellant paid the

excise duty for the beer in question (except for complementary beer)

based on the ex-factory price.

It is common ground that the aforesaid formula set out in section 7(1)(a)

for ascertaining the value of the article for the purpose of calculating

excise duty applies only where the buyer is not a related person and the

price is the sole consideration of sale.

The counter-argument of learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent is that, as the buyers in this instance are related persons,

i.e. admittedly distributors of the appellant, the ex-factory price cannot

be regarded as the normal price, and instead the normal price should

be the wholesale price at which distributors sell the beer to retailers.

When the price formula under section 7(1)(a) is inapplicable, proviso (ii)

of section 7(1)(a) becomes applicable to determine the price for calculating

excise duty:

[W]here such excisable articles are not sold by the assessee in the

course of wholesale trade except to or through a related person, the

normal price of the excisable articles sold by the assessee to or

through such related person shall be deemed to be the price at which

they are ordinarily sold, in the course of wholesale trade at the time

of removal to dealers, not being related persons or where such

6

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

excisable articles are not sold to such dealers, to dealers being

related persons who sell excisable articles in retail.

It is noteworthy that section 7(1)(a) refers to wholesale trade rather than

wholesale price. However, it is the appellant who employs the term

wholesale price in document P6, which will be addressed later. As

defined in section 7(3)(e), wholesale trade refers to sales to local

authorities, dealers, industrial and other buyers who or which purchase

their requirements otherwise than in retail.

The arguments of both parties on this point revolve around whether a

distributor falls within the definition of the term related person, as the

beer in question was admittedly sold by the appellant to distributors.

Section 7(3) defines the term related person as follows:

related person means a person who is so associated with the

assessee that they have a direct interest in the business of each

other and includes a holding company, a subsidiary company, a

relative and distributor of the assessee or any sub-distributor of

such distributor.

According to Article 23(1) of the Constitution, All laws and subordinate

legislation shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala and Tamil,

together with a translation thereof in English. The Sinhala text of the

above definition reads as follows:

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

Learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant, citing Indian judgments

(Union of India v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd and Others AIR 1984 SC

420, Moped India Ltd v. Assistant Collector of Central Excise (1985) 1 SCR

954) contends that the phrase a relative and distributor of the assessee

should be interpreted as referring to a distributor who is also a relative

of the assessee, rather than as two separate categories. Accordingly, he

submits that the distributors to whom the beer was sold in this case do

not qualify as related persons for the purpose of calculating excise duty.

I regret my inability to agree with this argument. A plain reading of the

Sinhala text indicates that a relative, a distributor of the assessee, and

any sub-distributor of such distributor (

) are distinct

and must be read separately. To interpret a relative and distributor of

the assessee as a single unit would inevitably lead to anomalous results.

To interpret a relative and distributor of the assessee as a single unit

would inevitably lead to anomalous results: For instance, if the assessee

is an incorporated company, as in this case, a distributor could never be

regarded as a related person, since a distributor cannot be a relative of

a company, nor could a close relative be considered a related person

unless such relative is also a distributor.

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statues, 12th Edition (1969), at page 201

states:

Where possible, a construction should be adopted which will

facilitate the smooth working of the scheme of legislation established

by the Act, which will avoid producing or prolonging artificiality in

the law, and which will not produce anomalous results.

The definition of the term related person quoted above uses both

means and includes. When the word means is used, the definition

8

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

is restrictive and exhaustive. It is a word of limitation. When the word

includes is used, the definition is inclusive and expansive. It is a word

of enlargement to cover things which do not fall within the ordinary

meaning of the word defined. It imports addition to what has already been

defined under means. This inclusive definition is a legal fiction which

in reality may not exist but are deemed applicable within the statute.

(Craies on Statute Law, 7th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell (1971), pages 212-

215, N.S. Bindra, Interpretation of Statues, 13th Edition, LexisNexis

(2023), pages 268-273, D.P. Mittal, Interpretation of Statutes, 2nd edition,

Taxmann Allied Services Pvt Ltd, New Delhi, pages 774-777)

Maxwell, in the above-mentioned book, explains this principle as follows

at pages 270-271:

It is common for a statute to contain a provision that certain words

and phrases shall, when used in the statute, bear particular

meanings.

Sometimes, it is provided that a word shall mean what the

definition section says it shall mean: in this case, the word is

restricted to the scope indicated in the definition section. Sometimes,

however, the word include is used in order to enlarge the meaning

of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when

it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as

comprehending, not only such thing as they signify according to their

natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause

declares that they shall include. (Dilworth v. Commissioner of

Stamps [1899] A.C. 99, per Lord Watson at pp. 105, 106) In other

words, the word in respect of which includes is used bears both

its extended statutory meaning and its ordinary, popular, and

natural sense whenever that would be properly applicable.

9

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

(Robinson v. Barton-Eccles Local Board (1883) 8 App. Cas. 798, per

Earl of Selborne L.C. at p. 801)

Thus, by section 10(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Trinidad and

Tobago: For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of

any person, there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses

wholly and exclusively incurred during the year preceding the year

of assessment by such person in the production of the income,

including(f) annuities or other annual payments whether

payable within or out of the colony. The Judicial Committee held

that an annual payment might be deducted under paragraph (f)

notwithstanding that it was not an expense incurred in the

production of income, the effect of including being to comprehend

in outgoings and expenses incurred in the production of income

payments which would not fall within the natural meaning of those

words. (Reynolds v. Commissioner of Income Tax for Trinidad and

Tobago [1967] 1 A.C. 1)

The definition of the term related person has two parts: (a) related

person means a person who is so associated with the assessee that they

have a direct interest in the business of each other and (b) related person

includes a holding company, a subsidiary company, a relative and

distributor of the assessee or any sub-distributor of such distributor. The

first part requires the application of a de facto test, whereas the second

part requires the application of a de jure test.

The legislature by application of a de jure test has extended the meaning

of related person to include a holding company, a subsidiary company,

a relative and distributor of the assessee and any sub-distributor of such

distributor, by operation of law. The expression where the buyer is not

a related person and the price is the sole consideration of sale should be

read conjunctively, meaning that in case where the buyer is a related

10

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

person, the price typically ceases to be the sole consideration for the sale.

However, I must add that this is a presumption, which can be rebutted

by the assessee by presenting evidence that, although the buyer is prima

facie a related person, he is in fact not, as there is no direct interest in

the business of each other, and there is no difference between him and

another unrelated buyer.

The document marked P6 by the appellant is of great assistance in

resolving the main issue. According to P6, there are three key price

points: the ex-factory price, the wholesale price, and the retail price. The

ex-factory price represents the price at which the appellant sells the beer

to its distributors at the time of removal from the factory. The wholesale

price refers to the price at which distributors sell beer to retailers, while

the retail price is the price at which retailers sell beer to consumers.

It is important to note that at all three points, the prices are determined

not by the distributors or retailers but by the appellant. This position is

confirmed by P6 and is admitted by the appellant. This proves that the

appellant maintains control over the sale price, including the wholesale

price, even after the (purported) first sale at the factory premises. Such

control exercised by the appellant casts doubt on whether the ex-factory

price can truly be considered the normal price, or whether it is merely a

subterfuge, with the distributor acting as an agent of the appellant. I am

not fully satisfied with the explanation provided by the appellant that this

pricing mechanism is implemented only to prevent distributors and

retailers from profiteering. On the facts and circumstances of this case, I

find that the presumption that the distributor is a related person for the

purpose of calculating excise duty has not been rebutted by the assessee.

Individuals have a legitimate right to the property they have lawfully

acquired through their own efforts, as such assets represent the fruit of

their labour rather than something unlawfully obtained or appropriated.

11

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this right,

stating that everyone has the right to own property and that no one shall

be arbitrarily deprived of it. Penal statutes that restrict personal liberty

and fiscal statutes that affect right to property must be strictly construed.

Taxing statutes are both fiscal and penal in nature, as non-payment of

taxes can result in imprisonment.

At the same time, taxation serves as a critical mechanism for government

functioning, providing the primary source of revenue necessary for

delivering essential public services, such as healthcare, education, social

welfare, law enforcement, and national defence. These services are vital

inter alia for maintaining public safety, law and order, and a well-

functioning society. This underscores the need to strike a delicate

balance between the governments fiscal requirements and the protection

of individuals rights to their lawfully acquired property.

On the interpretation of taxing statutes, Maxwell in the afore-mentioned

book states at page 141:

The language used is not to be either stretched, in favour of the

Crown or narrowed in favour of the taxpayer. So where the court has

to consider a provision expressly designed to prevent tax evasion,

which uses unnecessarily wide language to achieve its purpose, that

language will be given effect to even though the section is thereby

made to apply to cases which it was probably never intended to

catch.

The Supreme Court of India in Calcutta Choromtype Ltd v. Collector of

Central Excise, Calcutta 1998 (99) ELT 202 emphasized that tax evasion

is not a commendable exercise of ingenuity:

Colourable devices, however, cannot be part of tax planning.

Dubious methods resorting to artifice or subterfuge to avoid payment

12

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

of taxes on what really is income can today no longer be applauded

and legitimised as a splendid work by a wise man but has to be

condemned and punished with severest of penalties.

Whilst acknowledging that if the language in a charging section of a tax

statute is ambiguousallowing one interpretation in favour of the tax

collector and another in favour of the taxpayerthe Court should adopt

the interpretation favouring the taxpayer until the legislature resolves the

ambiguity through an amendment, it must be emphasized that this

principle does not extend to interpreting provisions in a manner that

benefits a tax evader.

The Court of Appeal did not err when it decided that the distributors are

related persons for the purpose of the Act and the appellant must pay

excise duty based on the wholesale price at which distributors sold beer

to retailers.

Determination under section 9(2)

The appellant complains that there was no proper determination by the

respondent against the appellant on the excise duty payable, which is a

sine qua non prior to embarking upon the recovery process.

Section 9(1) of the Act (without the proviso) reads as follows:

Where any excise duty has not been levied or paid on any excisable

article or has been levied or paid only in part on such excisable

article or where it has been erroneously refunded, an excise officer

may, within a period of five years from the relevant date serve notice

on the person chargeable with excise duty which has not been levied

or paid or which has not been levied or paid in full or to whom a

refund has been erroneously made, requiring him to show cause

why he should not pay the amount so specified in the notice.

13

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

In terms of section 9(1), a formal notice marked P10 dated 16.02.2000

was issued to the appellant requiring it to show cause as to why the

appellant should not pay the amount specified in the notice for the period

November 1998 to December 1999. This was replied to by the appellant

by P11 dated 04.04.2000, denying the liability. Thereafter several

meetings were held and correspondence was exchanged between the

appellant and the respondent on the question of the determination of the

value for calculating the excise duty payable, as evidenced from inter alia

P7-P37 and 1R2-1R5.

Section 9(2) of the Act reads as follows:

The Director-General shall, after considering the representations, if

any, made by the person on whom notice is served under subsection

(1), determine the amount of excise duty due from such person, not

being an amount in excess of the amount specified in the notice, and

notify him accordingly, and thereupon such person shall pay the

amount so determined.

The argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant is that,

following P11 and several subsequent meetings and correspondence, no

determination was made by the respondent under section 9(2) of the

Act. Therefore, the respondent could not have resorted to section 12 of

the Act to initiate proceedings before the Magistrates Court for the

recovery of excise duty.

I am unable to accept this argument. It is quite evident from the several

marked documents referred to earlier that the appellant repeatedly

sought clarifications regarding the calculation whenever the respondent

was poised to make the determination as contemplated in section 9(2).

By doing so, the appellant, wittingly or unwittingly, kept on postponing

the payment of default taxes since the year 2000.

14

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

There is no peremptory requirement that the letter containing section 9(2)

determination be explicitly titled Determination under section 9(2) of the

Act. Let me explain. When section 9(1) notice was sent by P10, the

appellant was required to show cause in terms of the said section.

Although the appellant claims that it showed cause by P11, P11 does not

explicitly state that it is the show cause letter. However, learned Deputy

Solicitor General accepts it as such, based on the principle that

substance prevails over form. At least, P33 can be regarded as the

determination as contemplated in section 9(2). After P33 was sent, what

did the appellant do? The appellant again sent P34 requesting the

respondent to provide the appellant with detailed computation for further

consideration. If the respondent replied P34, the appellant would have

sent another letter seeking further details. There is no end. The

respondent has been attempting to recover default taxes of 1998-1999.

Since then, parties have been in negotiation and litigation. P34 was

written in 2008, and we are now in 2024. Ingenious methods of

postponing tax liabilities cannot be condoned.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot accept the

argument that there is no section 9(2) determination in this case.

Complimentary beer

The respondent alleges that excise duty for complimentary beer issued

during the 4th quarter of 2000, the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001, and the

1st quarter of 2002 remains unpaid by the appellant. This was first

communicated to the appellant in vague terms without any specific

details by P24 dated 10.10.2007. It was by P29 dated 22.05.2008 that

the respondent communicated to the appellant for the first time the

period and the amount to be paid for the complimentary beer. Thereafter

the same amount (without mentioning the period for which the amount

was due) was communicated to the appellant by P31 dated 04.06.2008.

15

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

The amount of excise duty payable for the said quarters with a

breakdown for each quarter was communicated to the appellant for the

first time by P33 dated 21.07.2008.

The main argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant in

this regard is that this claim is time-barred as recovery is permitted only

within five years after the relevant date as stipulated in section 9(1) of the

Act. He further submits that the appellant did not receive a section 9(1)

notice regarding the complimentary beer.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General in his post-argument written

submissions submits that P33 may be treated as a notice under section

9(1):

The notice under section 9(1) must only provide the assessee with

the amount payable by the assessee. The purpose of this is to enable

the assessee to seek a determination or appeal in terms of the Act.

Insofar as P33 is concerned it clearly provides the above details to

the petitioners and thus satisfies the legal requirements under

section 9(1) in respect of notice.

For the time being, I will accept this submission.

Section 9(1) reads as follows:

Where any excise duty has not been levied or paid on any excisable

article or has been levied or paid only in part on such excisable

article or where it has been erroneously refunded, an excise officer

may, within a period of five years from the relevant date serve notice

on the person chargeable with excise duty which has not been levied

or paid or which has not been levied or paid in full or to whom a

refund has been erroneously made, requiring him to show cause

why he should not pay the amount so specified in the notice.

16

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

Section 32, in defining quarter states that, the quarter means the period

of three months commencing on the first day of January, the first day of

April, the first day of July, and the first day of October of each year.

Section 9(3)(ii)(b), in defining relevant date states that where no return

is furnished, the last date on which such return is to be furnished should

be regarded as the relevant date.

The fact that this claim was not made within five years after the relevant

date is not disputed by learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent, but he relies on the proviso to section 9(1) of the Act to bring

the claim within the prescribed period. The proviso to section 9(1) of the

Act reads as follows:

Provided that where any excise duty has not been levied or paid at

all or has been levied or paid only in part in contravention of any of

the provisions of this Act or any regulations made thereunder or has

been erroneously refunded, by reason of fraud, collusion or any

wilful misstatement or suppression of facts, the period referred to in

this subsection shall extend to ten years from the date on which

detection thereof was made.

The argument of learned Deputy Solicitor General as articulated in the

post-argument written submission (quoted below) is that, as the

respondent detected the issuance of complimentary beer without

payment of the excise duty on or about 10.10.2007, and the appellant

failed to provide details regarding the issuance of complimentary beer

despite repeated requests made after P24 dated 10.10.2007, the claim on

complimentary beer prescribes after ten years from the date of detection,

and therefore the claim is not prescribed.

In terms of the document marked P27, the fact that the petitioner

company had been issuing complimentary beer without paying

17

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

excise duty thereon had been detected by the respondent on or about

10 October 2007. Since then, despite repeated requests by the

respondents, the petitioner company has failed to disclose any

particulars relating to the issue of complimentary beer.

In those circumstances, the respondents submit that the proviso to

section 9(1) of the Act will apply, and therefore the applicable time

period for the recovery of such excise duty is ten years from 10

October 2007.

I regret that this argument does not commend itself to me. As evidenced

from P29, P31 and P33, the respondent made the calculation on the

complimentary beer with the assistance of the reports prepared by the

respondents officers and the reports furnished by the appellant. Had the

respondent been diligent and eager to recover the excise duty on the

complimentary beer issued, the calculation could have been made in the

same manner within five years from the relevant date. This was not done.

As evidenced by 1R4 dated 04.03.2002 produced by the respondent

himself, the respondent was aware of the non-payment of excise duty for

the complimentary beer at least by that date, when the appellants lawyer

at the customs inquiry held on that date reportedly agreed to pay the

excise duty for the complimentary beer. The respondent had ample time

to send the notice within the time stipulated in section 9(1) of the Act,

but failed to take action until the claim became prescribed. The

submission that the respondent detected the issuance of complimentary

beer by the appellant without payment of excise duty only on or around

10.10.2007 cannot be accepted.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I hold that the proviso to

section 9(1) is inapplicable. I accept the argument of learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant that the claim in relation to complimentary beer

18

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

is prescribed. The Court of Appeal did not consider this matter in its

judgment.

Conclusion

The questions of law on which special leave to appeal was granted and

the answers thereto are as follows:

(a) Could the Court of Appeal have come to a finding that the letter of

22nd May 2008 (P29) was a Notice under and in terms of section

9(1) of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, as amended?

A. P29 is relevant to complimentary beer. As the claim for

complimentary beer is prescribed, there is no necessity to

answer this question.

(b) Could the Court of Appeal have come to the finding that the letter

of 4th June 2008 (P31) was a determination under and in terms of

section 9(2) of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, as amended?

A. The answer to (a) above is applicable.

(c) Could the Court of Appeal in any event have come to a finding that

a determination under section 9(2) of the Excise (Special

Provisions) Act, as amended, had been duly made on the facts and

circumstances of this case?

A. Yes (except for complimentary beer).

(d) Could the Court of Appeal have come to a finding that the persons

who bought beer from the appellant were related persons having

a direct interest in the business of each other as defined in section

7(3)(c) of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, as amended?

A. Yes.

19

SC/APPEAL/206/2014

(e) On the facts of this case, is the ex-factory price at which the beer

was sold to its distributors in the wholesale trade at its factory

premises, the normal price within the meaning of the provisions

of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act?

A. No.

(f) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that excise duty was

recoverable from the appellant on the complimentary beer when no

notice under section 9(1) of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act was

issued on the appellant?

A. The answer to (a) above is applicable.

(g) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in so holding without considering

the time bar stipulated in section 9 of the Excise (Special

Provisions) Act, as amended, where recovery was prohibited after 5

years had lapsed from the relevant date?

A. The claim for complimentary beer is prescribed.

With the exception of the excise duty payable on the complimentary beer

issued during the 4th quarter of 2000, the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001,

and the 1st quarter of 2002 (the last four items in P37/the last four items

in the table filed with the certificate in the Magistrates Court), the

respondent is entitled to recover the remaining excise duty in default from

the appellant.

Subject to setting aside the finding on the recovery of excise duty on the

complimentary beer, the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

07.08.2013 is affirmed.

The appeal is partly allowed. I make no order as to costs.
