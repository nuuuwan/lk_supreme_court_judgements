"Maxwell, in the above-mentioned book, explains this principle as follows"
"at pages 270-271:"
"It is common for a statute to contain a provision that certain words"
"and  phrases  shall,  when  used 
in 
the  statute,  bear  particular"
"meanings."
"Sometimes, 
it 
is  provided 
that  a  word  shall  “mean”  what 
the"
"definition  section  says  it  shall  mean:  in  this  case,  the  word  is"
"restricted to the scope indicated in the definition section. Sometimes,"
"however, the word “include” is used “in order to enlarge the meaning"
"of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when"
"it 
is  so  used 
these  words  or  phrases  must  be  construed  as"
"comprehending, not only such thing as they signify according to their"
"natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause"
"declares  that  they  shall 
include.” 
(Dilworth  v.  Commissioner  of"
"Stamps [1899] A.C. 99, per Lord Watson at pp. 105, 106) In other"
"words, the word in respect of which “includes” is used bears both"
"its  extended  statutory  meaning  and  “its  ordinary,  popular,  and"
"natural  sense  whenever 
that  would  be  properly  applicable.”"
