SC/APPEAL/206/2014"
"There is no peremptory requirement that the letter containing section 9(2)"
"determination be explicitly titled “Determination under section 9(2) of the"
"Act”.  Let  me  explain.  When  section  9(1)  notice  was  sent  by  P10,  the"
"appellant  was  required  “to  show  cause”  in  terms  of  the  said  section."
"Although the appellant claims that it showed cause by P11, P11 does not"
"explicitly state that it is the “show cause letter”. However, learned Deputy"
"Solicitor  General  accepts 
it  as  such,  based  on 
the  principle 
that"
"substance  prevails  over  form.  At  least,  P33  can  be  regarded  as  the"
"determination as contemplated in section 9(2). After P33 was sent, what"
"did  the  appellant  do?  The  appellant  again  sent  P34  requesting  the"
"respondent to provide the appellant with detailed computation for further"
"consideration.  If  the  respondent  replied  P34,  the  appellant  would  have"
"sent  another 
letter  seeking 
further  details.  There 
is  no  end.  The"
"respondent has been attempting to recover default taxes of 1998-1999."
"Since  then,  parties  have  been  in  negotiation  and  litigation.  P34  was"
"written 
in  2008,  and  we  are  now 
in  2024. 
Ingenious  methods  of"
"postponing tax liabilities cannot be condoned."
"On  the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case, 
I  cannot  accept  the"
"argument that there is no section 9(2) determination in this case."
"Complimentary beer"
"The respondent alleges that excise duty for complimentary beer issued"
"during the 4th quarter of 2000, the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001, and the"
"1st  quarter  of  2002  remains  unpaid  by  the  appellant.  This  was  first"
"communicated  to  the  appellant  in  vague  terms  without  any  specific"
"details by P24 dated 10.10.2007.  It was by P29 dated 22.05.2008  that"
"the  respondent  communicated  to  the  appellant  for  the  first  time  the"
"period and the amount to be paid for the complimentary beer. Thereafter"
"the same amount (without mentioning the period for which the amount"
"was due) was communicated to the appellant by P31 dated 04.06.2008."
