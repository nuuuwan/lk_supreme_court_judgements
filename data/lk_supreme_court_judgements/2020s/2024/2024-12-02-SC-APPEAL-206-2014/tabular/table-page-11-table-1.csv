SC/APPEAL/206/2014"
"Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms this right,"
"stating that everyone has the right to own property and that no one shall"
"be arbitrarily deprived of it. Penal statutes that restrict personal liberty"
"and fiscal statutes that affect right to property must be strictly construed."
"Taxing statutes are both fiscal and penal in nature, as non-payment of"
"taxes can result in imprisonment."
"At the same time, taxation serves as a critical mechanism for government"
"functioning,  providing  the  primary  source  of  revenue  necessary 
for"
"delivering essential public services, such as healthcare, education, social"
"welfare, law enforcement, and national defence. These services are vital"
"inter  alia  for  maintaining  public  safety,  law  and  order,  and  a  well-"
"functioning  society.  This  underscores  the  need  to  strike  a  delicate"
"balance between the government’s fiscal requirements and the protection"
"of individuals’ rights to their lawfully acquired property."
"On the interpretation of taxing statutes, Maxwell in the afore-mentioned"
"book states at page 141:"
