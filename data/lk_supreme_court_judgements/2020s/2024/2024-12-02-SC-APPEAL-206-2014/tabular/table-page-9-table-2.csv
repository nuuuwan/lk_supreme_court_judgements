"The  definition  of  the  term  “related  person”  has  two  parts:  (a)  related"
"person means a person who is so associated with the assessee that they"
"have a direct interest in the business of each other and (b) related person"
"includes  a  holding  company,  a  subsidiary  company,  a  relative  and"
"distributor of the assessee or any sub-distributor of such distributor. The"
"first part requires the application of a de facto test, whereas the second"
"part requires the application of a de jure test."
"The legislature by application of a de jure test has extended the meaning"
"of “related person” to include a holding company, a subsidiary company,"
"a relative and distributor of the assessee and any sub-distributor of such"
"distributor, by operation of law. The expression “where the buyer is not"
"a related person and the price is the sole consideration of sale” should be"
"read  conjunctively,  meaning  that  in  case  where  the  buyer  is  a  related"
