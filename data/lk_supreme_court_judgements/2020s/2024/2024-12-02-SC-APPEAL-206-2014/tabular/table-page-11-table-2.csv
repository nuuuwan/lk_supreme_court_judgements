"On the interpretation of taxing statutes, Maxwell in the afore-mentioned"
"book states at page 141:"
"The  language  used  is  not  to  be  either  stretched,  in  favour  of  the"
"Crown or narrowed in favour of the taxpayer. So where the court has"
"to consider a provision expressly designed to prevent tax evasion,"
"which uses unnecessarily wide language to achieve its purpose, that"
"language will be given effect to even though the section is thereby"
"made  to  apply  to  cases  which  it  was  probably  never  intended  to"
"catch."
