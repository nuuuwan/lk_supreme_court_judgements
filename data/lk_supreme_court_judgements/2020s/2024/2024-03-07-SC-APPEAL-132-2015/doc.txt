SC/APPEAL/132/2015

Samayawardhena, J.

The four plaintiffs filed this action on 15.06.1990 in the District Court of

Pugoda seeking partition of the land known as Ketakelagahawatta in

extent of one rood among the plaintiffs and the four defendants. The 5th-

11th defendants later intervened. After trial, the District Court delivered

judgment on 07.02.2006 declaring undivided shares of the land to all the

parties except the 8th and 9th defendants.

The appeal filed by the 8th and 9th defendants against the said judgment

was dismissed by the High Court of Civil Appeal of Avissawella by

judgment dated 22.01.2014.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, only the 9th

defendant appealed to this court.

The 9th defendant sought exclusion of Lot 3 of the Preliminary Plan No.

4686 contending that it is part of Delgahawatta, not Ketakelagahawatta.

The 9th defendant categorically admitted that she has no rights to

Ketakelagahawatta, for the partition of which this action was filed.

Even a cursory look at the Preliminary Plan makes it evident that Lot 3

cannot be part of a different land, as that Lot sits in the middle of the

land to be partitioned.

On what basis does the 9th defendant seek exclusion of Lot 3? The 9th

defendant says she is entitled to Lot 3 by maternal inheritance and by

deed marked 9D1. It is not clear how her mother, Laisa, got rights to

Delgahawatta. In any event, it is not necessary to understand the

devolution of title to Delgahawatta, as it is not the land sought to be

partitioned.

7

SC/APPEAL/132/2015

Deed 9D1 was executed on 16.05.1985 – only five years before the

institution of the partition action. By this deed the 9th defendant has

purchased about 10 perches from Delgahawatta bounded on the North

and West by Ketakelagahawatte agala and live fence, East by Gamsabha

road and South by the live fence separating a portion of this land owned

by Paseemadurage Seety. None of these boundaries tally with Lot 3 of the

Preliminary Plan. Notably, Lot 3 is not bounded on the East by Gamsabha

road.

The 9th defendant in her evidence admitted that, despite objections, she

put up the building in Lot 3 about three years before her giving evidence

(page 273 of the brief). That means, she constructed the building pending

partition under protest. According to the surveyor’s report it is a wattle

and daub house.

It was elicited during cross-examination that the 9th defendant’s husband

transferred his rights on Ketakelagahawatta by deed marked 10D2.

It is clear that the land described in deed 9D1 is not included in Lot 3 of

the Preliminary Plan.

The 9th defendant, by way of issues or in evidence, did not claim Lot 3 by

prescription.

This court has granted leave on the following questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by not excluding Lot

3 from the corpus?

(b) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by not excluding Lot

3 from the corpus when two boundaries of the Preliminary Plan do

not tally with the schedule to the plaint?

(c) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by not considering the

prescriptive title of the 9th defendant?

SC/APPEAL/132/2015

I answer the said questions in the negative.

I affirm the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and dismiss the

appeal with costs.
