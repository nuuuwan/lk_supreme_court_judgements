"A  careful  consideration  of  the  said  Regulation  shows  that  it  is  applicable  to  the  Industrial"
"Courts, arbitrators and Labour Tribunals. The phrase “where any such correction is made after"
"the date by which the award or decision is published in the Gazette, such correction shall also"
"be  published  in  the  Gazette  in  like  manner  as  the  original  award  or  decision”  applies  to"
"situations where Industrial Courts, arbitrators or Labour Tribunals exercise jurisdiction with"
"regard  to  industrial  disputes.  However,  the  said  Regulation  also  applies  when  the  Labour"
"Tribunal exercise jurisdiction under section 31 B (1) of the Industrial Dispute Act. Therefore,"
"the said Regulation confers power on the Industrial Court, arbitrator and Labour Tribunal to"
"make corrections to their awards, decisions and Orders."
"In any event, any court or Tribunal has inherent jurisdiction to correct any clerical error or"
"mistake  done  to  any  oversight.  Therefore,  the  Labour  tribunal  did  not  err  in  correcting  the"
"clerical errors in the Order under reference."
