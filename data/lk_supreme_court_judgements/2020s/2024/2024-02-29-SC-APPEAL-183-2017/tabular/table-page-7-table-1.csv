"Moreover, it was submitted that by the letter dated 5th of May, 2011, the appellant and another"
"employee of the accounts branch wrote a letter to the Chairman regarding their grievances. It"
"was further submitted that as the appellant did not receive any redress from the management"
"for her grievances, she tendered the resignation letter of 7th July, 2011, stating the reasons for"
"tendering resignation as unfair treatment by the management. However, the appellant withdrew"
"the letter five days prior to the acceptance of the resignation."
"Thereafter, the appellant informed the respondent that she tendered her resignation because of"
"the pressure exerted by the restaurant manager who was the head of the division where she was"
"working.  It  was  submitted  that  the  learned  President  of  the  Labour  Tribunal  held  that  the"
"appellant’s  club  failed  to  rebut  the  appellant’s  evidence  by  calling  the  restaurant  manager."
"Further, the respondents did not challenge the appellant’s position by cross-examining her on"
"the aforementioned points. Moreover, it was held that the resignation given by the appellant is"
"not voluntary but instead due to pressure exerted on her by the management."
"In the circumstances, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal held that the termination"
"was unlawful and unjust and granted compensation to the appellant by the Order dated 24th"
"April,  2014.  However,  it  was  submitted  that  in  calculating  the  amount  of  compensation,"
"mistakenly  8  years  was  taken  into  account  instead  of  the  period  of  service  for  18  years."
"Nevertheless,  without  delay,  the  learned  President  corrected  it  under  Regulation  29  of  the"
"Industrial Dispute."
