Facts of the case

The applicant-respondent-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant), an employee of

the Sinhalese Sports Club, alleged the unlawful termination of her employment. The appellant

further stated, inter alia, that she joined as a Trainee Clerk on the 12th of July, 1993, and at the

time of termination of her service, she was working as a Stores Account Clerk of the canteen.

5

Moreover, as the employer created a difficult environment to work, she tendered her

resignation by letter dated 7th of July, 2011, but later she sent another letter on the 11th of July,

2011, withdrawing her resignation. However, at the request of the employer, the appellant

changed the date of the said letter as the 12th of July, 2011. The appellant further stated that her

employment was terminated by the letter dated 2nd of August, 2011, and her last drawn salary

was Rs. 24,290.

The respondents-appellants-respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) filed

their answer and admitted the date of employment and the salary of the appellant. The

respondents further stated that the appellant voluntarily resigned on the 11th of July, 2011 and

thereby, she voluntary terminated her services.

Since the termination of services was denied by the respondents, the inquiry commenced with

the appellant giving evidence before the Labour Tribunal. At the inquiry before the Labour

Tribunal, the appellant stated that after the withdrawal of the letter of resignation, she was

called for a domestic inquiry by the letter dated 18th of July, 2011. After the said domestic

inquiry, by the letter dated 2nd August, 2011, resignation given by the appellant was accepted.

The letter further stated that the appellants complaint against a member of the Executive

Committee of the Club was proved to be a false allegation at the inquiry.

Thereafter, she has filed an application the Labour Tribunal. After the inquiry, the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal delivered his Order dated 24th of April, 2014. It was held that

the appellants resignation was not voluntary, and that acceptance of the resignation notice was

necessary prior to its withdrawal to render the resignation valid. Thus, it was held that the

termination of the services of the appellant by the respondent is unjust and unlawful.

Thus, the Labour Tribunal ordered the employer to pay a three months salary for each year of

service, but in calculation, the service period was taken as eight years. However, the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal after noticing the error in the order, corrected it under

Regulation 29 of the Industrial Disputes Act 1958 and ordered the respondent to pay a sum of

Rs. 1,311,660.

The respondents being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Labour Tribunal, referred an

appeal to the provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court). After the hearing, the learned judge of the High Court

delivered her Order on the 23rd of September, 2016, and held;

6

Respondent employee has terminated her employment by voluntary resignation

from the services of the Appellants Club and that was not a termination by the

employer

Accordingly, the Order of the Labour Tribunal was set aside, and an Order was made to give

Rs. 100,000 as ex-gratia payment.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the High Court, the appellant sought Special Leave to

Appeal from the Supreme Court and this court granted Leave on the following questions of

law;

(b). Did the Honourable High Court Judge err in law when she decided that

Regulation 29 of the Industrial Dispute Regulations 1958 is not applicable

to Labour tribunal

(c). Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court err in law when she

deciding that the Appellant terminated her service by tendering voluntary

resignation?

(e). Did the Honourable High Court Judge misinterpreted and misapply the

established legal principles applicable for the resignation of the employment

and thereby commit error of law.

In addition to the above questions of law, the court framed the following question of law;

Whether the compensation awarded by the Labour Tribunal is excessive?

Written Submissions on behalf of the appellant

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant tendered her resignation due

to ill treatment by the superior officers of the respondent club. It was also submitted that she

handed over a letter to the Chairman/Secretary of the respondent club stating the injustice that

was caused to the appellant by the General Manager. Furthermore, in the said letter, she stated

that her salary increment was not granted by the General Manager despite her superiors

recommendation of her work as being excellent in the evaluation of her work.

7

Moreover, it was submitted that by the letter dated 5th of May, 2011, the appellant and another

employee of the accounts branch wrote a letter to the Chairman regarding their grievances. It

was further submitted that as the appellant did not receive any redress from the management

for her grievances, she tendered the resignation letter of 7th July, 2011, stating the reasons for

tendering resignation as unfair treatment by the management. However, the appellant withdrew

the letter five days prior to the acceptance of the resignation.

Thereafter, the appellant informed the respondent that she tendered her resignation because of

the pressure exerted by the restaurant manager who was the head of the division where she was

working. It was submitted that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal held that the

appellants club failed to rebut the appellants evidence by calling the restaurant manager.

Further, the respondents did not challenge the appellants position by cross-examining her on

the aforementioned points. Moreover, it was held that the resignation given by the appellant is

not voluntary but instead due to pressure exerted on her by the management.

In the circumstances, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal held that the termination

was unlawful and unjust and granted compensation to the appellant by the Order dated 24th

April, 2014. However, it was submitted that in calculating the amount of compensation,

mistakenly 8 years was taken into account instead of the period of service for 18 years.

Nevertheless, without delay, the learned President corrected it under Regulation 29 of the

Industrial Dispute.

Written Submissions on behalf of the respondent

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the appellant tendered her resignation

dated 7th July, 2011, giving one months notice and stated that she will be resigning from

service with effect from the 7th of August, 2011. The Labour Tribunal held that as the contract

of employment did not have a clause regarding the period of giving a resignation, the

acceptance of the resignation tendered by the appellant was necessary.

The counsel further submitted that for the respondent, the appellant having given a valid notice

of resignation, was not entitled in law to withdraw the said notice of resignation and it is not

necessary to accept her resignation. Furthermore, it was submitted that the learned President

of the Labour Tribunal has failed to consider whether acceptance of resignation was required

8

in law for the resignation to take place. In the circumstances, it was submitted that the learned

judge of the Provincial High Court correctly arrived at the finding that the Order of the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal had error on the face of the record.

Moreover, the Labour Tribunal proceeded to change the Order purportedly in terms of

Regulation 29 of the Industrial Disputes Act. It was submitted that Regulation 29 has no

application to a Labour Tribunal exercising jurisdiction under and in terms of section 31 (b)

(1) (a) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Further, it was submitted that the reference to the award or decision to be published in the

Gazette makes it abundantly clear that this Regulation does not apply to a Labour Tribunal

exercising jurisdiction in terms of section 31 (b) (1) (a) of the Industrial Disputes Act because

there is no provision in law for a normal Labour Tribunal order to be published in the Gazette.

It is only awards and orders made in arbitrations are published in the Gazette in terms of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1958.

Therefore, it was submitted that the Order of the Labour Tribunal to change its prior Order was

made without jurisdiction and was an error of law on the face of the record. It was further

submitted that the learned High Court judge of the Provincial High Court Holden in Colombo

correctly arrived at the finding that the Labour Tribunal has no jurisdiction to change its own

Order after it was delivered. Accordingly, it was submitted to dismiss this appeal.

Did the Honourable High Court Judge err in law when she decided that Regulation 29 of

the Industrial Dispute Regulations 1958 is not applicable to Labour Tribunal?

Regulation 29 of Industrial Dispute Regulations, 1958 states;

An Industrial Court or an arbitrator or a Labour Tribunal may, in any

awards or decision or order made by such Court, arbitrator or Tribunal correct

any clerical error or mistake due to any oversight. Where any such correction

is made after the date by which the award or decision is published in the

Gazette, such correction shall also be published in the Gazette in like manner

as the original award or decision.

[emphasis added]

9

A careful consideration of the said Regulation shows that it is applicable to the Industrial

Courts, arbitrators and Labour Tribunals. The phrase where any such correction is made after

the date by which the award or decision is published in the Gazette, such correction shall also

be published in the Gazette in like manner as the original award or decision applies to

situations where Industrial Courts, arbitrators or Labour Tribunals exercise jurisdiction with

regard to industrial disputes. However, the said Regulation also applies when the Labour

Tribunal exercise jurisdiction under section 31 B (1) of the Industrial Dispute Act. Therefore,

the said Regulation confers power on the Industrial Court, arbitrator and Labour Tribunal to

make corrections to their awards, decisions and Orders.

In any event, any court or Tribunal has inherent jurisdiction to correct any clerical error or

mistake done to any oversight. Therefore, the Labour tribunal did not err in correcting the

clerical errors in the Order under reference.

Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court err in law when she decided that the

appellant terminated her service by tendering voluntary resignation?

The resignation letter of the appellant stated that she tendered her resignation due to unfair

treatment in the workplace by the manager, the lack of redress to her complaints, and not being

given the due salary increment. The resignation of an employee must be voluntary, and it

cannot be tainted by any element of influence by the employer or by a superior officer. The

evidence led at the Labour Tribunal shows that her resignation was a result of the ill-treatment

she received by her superiors. Hence, the resignation was not given voluntarily. Furthermore,

a resignation tendered by an employer is a unilateral termination of contract by the employee.

Hence, if tendered under duress, it amounts to constructive termination. Thus, the High Court

erred in holding that the appellant terminated her services voluntarily.

10

Did the Honourable High Court Judge misinterpret and misapply the established legal

principles applicable for the resignation of the employment and thereby commit an error

of law?

It is pertinent to note that the appellant withdrew the letter of resignation before it was accepted

by the respondent club. Thereafter, the respondent club conducted the domestic inquiry and

informed the appellant that the respondent club accepted the resignation which was withdrawn

by the employee. However, once the resignation is withdrawn, there is no valid resignation

that can be accepted.

A similar view was expressed in Virendera Chand v. The Thar Anchalic Gramin Bank and

Anr (1991) LLR 564 (Raj.HC) which held;

If an employee tenders his resignation during pendency of inquiry which is not

accepted by the management but terminated the services of the employee after

enquiry on the basis of resignation, such termination will be illegal.

In the circumstance, the High Court erred in law by allowing the appeal filed by the

respondents.

In view of the above, the other question of law is not answered.

Accordingly, appeal is allowed.

The judgment of the High Court dated 23rd of September, 2016 is set aside. The Order of the

Labour Tribunal dated 24th of April, 2014 is affirmed.
