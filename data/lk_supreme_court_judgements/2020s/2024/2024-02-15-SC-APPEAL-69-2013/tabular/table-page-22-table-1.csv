"Halideen no longer possessed title to the property. Further, it is an admitted fact that"
"the  prior  three  lease  agreements  from  the  period  between  1959  and  1970  were"
"executed  between  Halideen  and  the  Defendant’s  brother,  Ausadahamy  and  not  the"
"original Defendant himself. I fail to understand the Defendant’s claim for his rights as"
"a  lessee  when,  in  fact,  the  Defendant  was  not  a  party  to  the  lease  agreements,"
"specifically Deed No. 7287 in operation from 1964 to 1970, at all."
