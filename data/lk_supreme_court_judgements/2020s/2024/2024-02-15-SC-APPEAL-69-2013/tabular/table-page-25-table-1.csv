"substitution. Ashoka Chandrawathie appeared before the court as per the journal"
"entry dated 17.01.86. She has been substituted as  the 7E Defendant. Presently,"
"she  is  seeking  independent  entry  as  a  Defendant,  claiming  ownership  of  the"
"property based on Deeds No. 10861 of 1964 and No. 12644 of 1967. By the date"
"of her appearance in court on 17.01.1986, she must have been aware of the fact"
"that the relevant deeds were available to assert these claims. At that juncture, on"
"17.01.1986,  she  had  the  opportunity  to  contest  her  substitution  as  the  7E"
"Defendant  and  plead  to  be  entered  as  a  separate  independent  Defendant  by"
"presenting  pertinent  facts.  Without  doing  so,  the  current  application  is  being"
"submitted after a lapse of six years and this can be construed as an application"
"made to delay this case. Even though the facts presented in the written submission"
"on behalf of the 7E Defendant are considered, it is evident that her application to"
"be entered as a separate Defendant cannot be allowed based on the institution"
"of  the  initial  case  when  considering  the  procedure  prescribed  in  law  for  the"
"addition of parties under Section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code.]"
