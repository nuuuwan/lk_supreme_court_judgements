S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. In the early weeks of November 2019, the Royal Park Murder, as it was dubbed

commonly, made the limelight once more as the convict, Don Shramantha Jude

Anthony Jayamaha (the 2nd Respondent), to the utter disbelief of the public, was

granted a Presidential Pardon by the then Executive President Maithripala Sirisena, as

one of the hindermost acts of his incumbency.

2. The Petitioner, a non-profit organization dedicated to, inter alia, the promotion and

protection of the rights of women in Sri Lanka, moved this Court by Petition dated

13th November 2019 on behalf of themselves and especially in the public interest and

the general societal interest of Sri Lanka, invoking its sole and exclusive fundamental

rights jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution to review the constitutionality

of the said decision of His Excellency. The Petitioner contended, inter alia, the

impugned Pardon to be in violation of the fundamental right to equality and equal

protection of the law, of the Petitioner and of the people and the citizenry of Sri Lanka,

as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

3. The matter was taken up for support on 29th November 2019, by which point the

President had ceased to hold office. As such, the Petitioner filed the Amended Petition

dated 02nd December 2019, adding His Excellency the former President, Maithripala

Sirisena, as the 11A Respondent. Following the unfortunate delays caused by the

global pandemic, on 23rd September 2022, leave to proceed was granted in respect

of the Petitioner’s Application.

4. In the course of these proceedings, it was revealed that the 2nd Respondent had

received not one, but two presidential pardons. The first one of which was granted in

May 2016, whereby the sentence of death imposed upon the 2nd Respondent by the

Court of Appeal was commuted to one of life imprisonment. The second was granted

in November 2019 by the 11A Respondent in a purported exercise of his powers under

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 306

Article 34 of the Constitution, as a result of which the 2nd Respondent was released

from prison on 8th November 2019. I shall hereinafter refer to the former as the ‘1st

Pardon’ and the latter as the ‘2nd Pardon’, for the sake of convenience.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONER

5. Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC on behalf of the Petitioner, set forth extensive

submissions before this Court on various grounds challenging the constitutionality of

the 2nd Pardon and stressing the need for this Court to issue guidelines governing the

grant of presidential pardons. For ease of analysis, I have produced hereinbelow a

non-exhaustive summary of the most decisive of contentions so put forward.

6. The foremost contention of the Petitioner was that, unlike Article 72 of the

Constitution of India, which provides for the power of presidential pardon, Article 34

of the Constitution of Sri Lanka has imposed preconditions as set out under the

proviso to Article 34(1), which must be strictly adhered to in granting a pardon. Where

the proviso is not followed, it was contended, that such a pardon would amount to

an encroachment of judicial power.

7. Interestingly, the learned President’s Counsel opted not to challenge the 1st Pardon

but contended that the 2nd Respondent remains a murder convict despite the said

Presidential Pardon, for such a pardon does not have the effect of altering the

‘historical fact’ that he was sentenced to death. In this line of reasoning, it was further

contended that the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution contemplates this

historical fact of being sentenced to death by a court of law which cannot be altered

except by a court of higher standing; and as such the proviso must necessarily be

followed afresh in granting the impugned 2nd Pardon, which had not been done.

8. The Petitioner further submitted the power of pardon under Article 34 to be one

reposed on the President, and the President alone; and for this reason, it was argued

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 306

that it cannot be delegated to any other. In this regard, the Petitioner stressed that

there is no warrant signed by the President himself in the instant case. The learned

President’s Counsel for the 11A Respondent—former President Maithripala Sirisena—

conceded that there is no such warrant available but asserted that Article 34 does not

call for such a warrant, with which the learned Additional Solicitor General agreed.

9. Another one of the most pivotal contentions put forward by the Petitioner relates in

its essence to the Public Trust Doctrine. The learned President’s Counsel was steadfast

in his assertion that this power of presidential pardon is exercised on behalf of the

people, and therefore, it is to be exercised in the public interest in accordance with

the Public Trust Doctrine and that it must necessarily be free from whim, caprice,

arbitrariness, unreasonableness or mala fides. The same was unequivocally supported

by Mr. Saliya Pieris, PC representing the 7th and 8th Respondents as well as Dr. Romesh

De Silva, PC representing the 9th and 10th Respondents.

10. In their written submissions, the Petitioner also questioned, in view of the large

number of convicts on death row, if a proper system of evaluation and assessment

had been followed in selecting the beneficiaries of presidential pardons, and further

questioned how the 2nd Respondent was cherry-picked by the President to be granted

the privilege of a presidential pardon, to the exclusion of all other convicts; asserting

that the 2nd Respondent does not deserve state intervention to grant him a

presidential pardon by any parity of reasoning.

11. The Petitioner also emphasised that reasons must be given for any decision relating

to granting presidential pardons and that a pardon can be rescinded where there is

manifest fraud or deception in obtaining it.

12. In addition, the Petitioner alleged the Committee appointed by the then Minister of

Justice, for the ostensible purpose of giving recommendations, to be one not found

in law; and, regarding the reports prepared by the said committee, further asserted

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 306

its functions to have been a grave encroachment on the judicial province since said

recommendations have the effect of attempting to substitute the findings of the trial

court.

Intervenient-Petitioners

13. The 1st and 2nd Intervenient-Petitioners, Rev. Balangoda Buddhagosha Thero and

Most Rev. Dr. Raymond Wickramasinghe, by Petition dated 19th June 2023, sought to

be added as party Respondents. They sought to assist this Court by clarifying their

alleged involvement in granting the impugned 2nd Pardon following a news report,

which, in a gross misinterpretation of court proceedings, reported the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner to have submitted the names of the

Intervenient-Petitioners as being associated with the impugned Pardon.

14. The Press Release dated 11th November 2019 by the President’s Media Division

categorically mentions the Intervenient-Petitioners amongst those who requested a

presidential pardon to be granted to the 2nd Respondent. By their affidavits, the

Intervenient-Petitioners submitted this alleged involvement to be an utter falsity and

further clarified the actual facts and circumstances of their appeals.

15. They asserted that their appeals only urged the former President to pay more

attention towards detainees in general, so as to educate and rehabilitate them in a

positive environment until their sentences are concluded. They further asserted that

they had not made any personal requests on behalf of the 2nd Respondent in order

to obtain a presidential pardon. After perusing the appeals made by the Intervenient-

Petitioners to the President, this Court is left with no doubts as to the truthfulness of

the aforesaid assertions.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 306

SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS

16. The 2nd Respondent—the grantee of the Pardon, Don Shramantha Jude Anthony

Jayamaha—remained absent and unrepresented all through this hearing.

17. The 7th and 8th Respondents, the President and Secretary of the Bar Association of Sri

Lanka, and the 9th and 10th Respondents, Roger Johnson and Caroline Jonsson-

Bradley, the father and the sister of the deceased Yvonne Johnson, made

representations before this Court, and their submissions are congruent to a great

extent with that of the Petitioner, albeit with slight dissimilarities with regards to

certain legal positions.

18. Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC representing the 9th and 10th Respondents, challenged the

1st Pardon as well as the 2nd Pardon, unlike the Petitioner, and prayed that

compensation be granted to the 9th and 10th Respondent for the troubles and

distresses they have had to endure as a result of the impugned acts of the 11A

Respondent.

19. He emphasized the necessity to follow the purposive approach in interpreting Article

34 of the Constitution and deemed the proviso to Article 34(1) as being a condition

precedent to granting of pardon to offenders condemned to death by a court of law,

and further maintained that the power only exists once this condition precedent has

been fulfilled. Accordingly, any purported exercise of Article 34(1) without conforming

to the procedure set out in the proviso thereunder was argued to be ultra vires.

20. The learned President’s Counsel recognized Section 3(q) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 to be a mandatory

legal requirement in granting a pardon, and further commented that while there is no

strict legal requirement of consulting any other stakeholders, such consultation may

stand favourably towards state actors insofar as the test of reasonability is concerned.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 306

21. With regards to the circumstances of the 1st and 2nd Pardons, he invited the Court to

take cognizance of the fact that the purported directions/orders—however it might

be aptly termed—by the then President, dated 20th March 2016 and 29th October

2019, do not amount to ‘warrants’ or ‘proclamations’ but are mere approvals at best;

and as such contended the said directions/orders to lack the required sanctity in law.

22. Moreover, it was contended that there is a total failure to comply with the procedure

set out under the proviso to Article 34(1) for the report from the trial judge, the report

containing advice of the Attorney-General and the report containing the

recommendations of the Minister of Justice have not been obtained in granting the

1st and 2nd Pardons. The learned President's Counsel contended any one of those

failures, on its own, to be capable of vitiating the decision to grant a pardon, and that

a total failure of this nature to be most certainly fatal inasmuch as such action would

be procedurally ultra vires and therefore null and void ab initio.

23. Furthermore, the learned President’s Counsel strongly emphasized the necessity of

being cautious in considering authorities from other jurisdictions, for it is paramount

that we appreciate our own distinct constitutional framework and its developments

first and foremost in interpreting Article 34. Illustrating this point, he pointed out how

the preamble of the Constitution of India manifests the Constitution as supreme

whereas the Constitution of Sri Lanka manifests the people as supreme and sovereign.

He further submitted Article 4 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka to set out the manner

in which the people expect to exercise their powers as the sovereign and any deviation

of it to be unconstitutional. The learned President’s Counsel conceded that, according

to the jurisprudence of India, the President of India can, in fact, look into the merits

of a case, but further contended this line of reasoning to be wholly inappropriate in

our own constitutional setting as the President is not vested with any judicial power

in terms of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 306

24. In full agreement with the Petitioner with regards to the effect of a pardon, it was

submitted by the learned President's Counsel that what a pardon ‘takes away’ or

‘erases’ is the punishment and not the conviction. The conviction would remain intact,

as the former is a matter for the executive whereas the latter is a matter for the

judiciary.

25. Commenting on the purpose of presidential pardoning power in general, the learned

President’s Counsel noted that this power exists in many jurisdictions as a means of

remedying cases of proven miscarriages of justice and asserted that the President

within our own framework has no power to correct miscarriages of justice for the

same reason aforementioned.

26. With regards to the jurisdiction of the Court, he submitted all acts of the President to

be judicially reviewable, except where such power has been expressly ousted by the

Constitution itself; and the standard of judicial review applicable to acts done by the

President under Article 34 of the Constitution was suggested to be the same standard

applicable to any other matter which is subject to judicial review for it would be

anathema to the Rule of Law and our Constitution if it is held that the President

possessed unfettered power in any regard.

27. Mr. Saliya Pieris, PC representing the 7th and 8th Respondents advocated that all

presidential pardons must necessarily consider the perspective of the victims, and that

any pardon must be such to preserve the Rule of Law.

28. He differed greatly from the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner as well as

9th and 10th Respondents inasmuch as he contended that the President must be able

to rectify where there is a miscarriage of justice, as our law does not recognize a review

process once the appeals have been exhausted. In support, he highlighted how legal

wrongs of the same nature may carry varying degrees of blameworthiness, so to

speak, in certain moral perspectives.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 306

29. Commenting on the effects of a pardon, the learned President’s Counsel submitted

that the judicial finding of guilt remains untouched following a pardon, as it is only a

convict who can be pardoned; but conversely, he also recognized ‘free pardons’ as

being an exception, where the conviction was said to be as good as erased.

30. The learned President’s Counsel further invited the Court to take cognizance of how

the 69 other inmates, whose sentences were also commuted as a result of the 1st

Pardon, may be affected by any pronouncements of this Court. However, in this

regard, as I shall advert to later on, the learned Additional Solicitor General, on behalf

of the Hon. Attorney-General, submitted the actions of the former President in

granting the 1st Pardon as well as the 2nd Padon to be ultra vires for the mandatory

procedure set out in the proviso to Article 34(1) has not been followed.

31. While the submissions of the two aforementioned Respondents buttress the position

taken by the Petitioner in various degrees, the submissions of the 11A Respondent

stand in stark contrast.

Submissions of the 11A Respondent

32. Representing the 11A Respondent, Mr. Faiszer Mustapha, PC took up the position that

the failures of state officials and other non-state parties involved in the process of

granting the impugned Pardon cannot and should not cast aspersions against the

11A Respondent. In this line of reasoning, the learned President’s Counsel attempted

to draw a distinction between the office of presidency and the holder of such office,

asserting the liability of the state vis-à-vis the liability of the 11A Respondent to be

distinct and separate.

33. The position of the 11A Respondent was that he has, at all times material to this case,

acted reasonably in good faith, and not arbitrarily, considering the advice given to

him by those well suited to give such advice, and further contended that there has

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 306

been substantial compliance to the procedural requirements on the part of the 11A

Respondent in granting the 1st and 2nd Pardons.

34. With regards to the procedure established under proviso to Article 34(1), the learned

President’s Counsel contended the conduct of 11A Respondent to be in substantial

compliance with the said procedure as it was the recommendations made by the

Minster of Justice—being the final step of the procedure therein—had purportedly

been followed by the 11A Respondent. He asserted that it is reasonable for him to

presume compliance with the procedure established by law, once such

recommendations have been received from a legal luminary such as the Minister of

Justice at that time. In considering this contention, the learned President’s Counsel

also invited this Court to take cognizance of the fact that the 11A Respondent is a ‘lay

President’ in assessing the merits of his conduct.

35. The 11A Respondent was adamant in his position that state officials have been

imprudent in their official conduct and that he has, at all times, followed the advice

tendered to him. He further stated that he exercised this power in the same manner

as every President before him and that he has not done anything his predecessors

have not done, and listed out many instances where the exercise of the power of

pardon by his predecessor and successors have been controversial.

36. In furtherance of this position, he invited notice towards a letter sent by the

Presidential Secretariat dated 14th July 2015—during the incumbency of former

President Mahinda Rajapaksa—where it is evident on the face of it that officials have

acted on the fallacious understanding that the reports contemplated under Article 34

of the Constitution and Section 286(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act are one

and the same.

37. With regards to the effect of a pardon, the 11A Respondent, in stark contrast to all

other parties who made submissions before this Court, contended that the 2nd

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 306

Respondent ceased to be an offender condemned to suffer death once the 1st Pardon

was granted, for the said Pardon commuted the sentence of death imposed by the

Court of Appeal to one of life imprisonment. In view of this, the written submissions

tendered on behalf of the 11A Respondent, dated 24th March 2023, assert that it was

not mandatory to follow the procedure set out in the proviso to Article 34(1) and that

the President could exercise his powers under Article 34 freely insofar as the

impugned 2nd Pardon is concerned, as the 2nd Respondent was no longer an offender

sentenced to death at the time of the said Pardon.

38. However, with regards to the question as to whether or not the power of pardon

impinges upon the powers of the judiciary, the 11A Respondent, in his written

submissions dated 25th August 2023, asserted the power of pardon to be a purely

executive function and that the President acts in a wholly different plane which in no

way make inroads to the judicial province.

39. Furthermore, in the written submissions dated 25th August 2023, the 11A Respondent

raised a technical objection with regard to the Petitioner’s failure to substitute the

present Minister of Justice, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC, and thereby pleaded the

application be dismissed in limine for want of necessary parties.

Submissions of the Hon. Attorney-General

40. On behalf of the Hon. Attorney-General, Additional Solicitor General Mr. Nerin Pulle,

PC made submissions representing the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents, and

tendered exhaustive written submissions on 09th August 2023, several weeks before

any other party with commendable expeditiousness.

41. The learned Additional Solicitor General categorically asserted during his oral

submissions as well as the written submissions that the Attorney-General never

represented the 11A Respondent, as he has ceased to hold office as the President,

and only represented the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 306

42. Most significantly, the learned Additional Solicitor General agreed with the contention

of the Petitioner that the actions of the former President in granting the 2nd Pardon

are ultra vires. In that, he contended the 1st Pardon itself to be ultra vires and a nullity

by virtue of the failure on the part of the former President to follow the procedure

established by law. Due to this, it was submitted that the 2nd Respondent remained a

prisoner condemned to death at the time of granting the 2nd Pardon, which meant

that it was mandatory for the President to have followed the procedure set out under

Article 34(1).

43. Insofar as the purpose of the power of pardon is concerned, he submitted this power

to be one corollary of values such as compassion and forgiveness, which are

fundamental values in all mainstream religions. It was submitted that the power is

vested in the President as a ‘safeguard’ against judicial errors or as a ‘check’ on the

powers of the judiciary. The learned Additional Solicitor General was of the opinion

that this power is not only a ‘check’ on the judiciary, merely limited to rectifying

miscarriages of justice, but also one which may be used on a number of other grounds

which are impossible to be exhaustively listed. The power of pardon was described as

one which would extend to situations where the exercise of judicial power, whether

due to factors existing at the time or supervening circumstances, has led to a result

wherein the continued deprivation of liberty of the individual cannot stand.

44. It was further submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that unless there

is obvious or gross unlawfulness, such as in the case of a pardon granted in return for

a bribe, the judicial arm of the State would be wary of interfering with the exercise of

such power by the executive arm. The learned Additional Solicitor General also took

up the position, in his oral submissions as well as his written submissions, that the

power of the President under Article 34(1) constitutes a sui generis power, the exercise

of which amounts neither to executive nor administrative action as contemplated in

Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution. On the other hand, he also

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 306

conceded during his submission that any purported exercise of the power of pardon

can be judicially reviewed insofar as the procedure established under the proviso to

Article 34(1) is concerned.

45. With regards to the role of the Minister of Justice, it was the submission of the learned

Additional Solicitor General that the Minister’s function in the pardoning process

commences if, and only if, the President has instigated the process set out under the

proviso. It was further submitted that the advice tendered by the Minister in the

instant case to not be the recommendation as contemplated under the said proviso.

46. The learned Additional Solicitor General also submitted, via written submission dated

5th August 2023, a list of provisions to be found in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,

No. 15 of 1979 and the Prisons Ordinance, No. 16 of 1877 enabling commutation and

remission of sentences which he contended to be parallel to Article 34.

47. With regards to Section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime

and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015, the learned Additional Solicitor General differed

greatly from the opinions of other Counsel. It was his submission that the

requirements under the said Act can only be conceived as directory, and also that it

would be to add on to or otherwise modify the Constitution if the same were to be

held mandatory.

48. The learned Additional Solicitor General, having agreed that the actions of the

President in granting the pardon are ultra vires, further submitted the decision of the

11A Respondent to pardon the 2nd Respondent, though it may have been done under

the colour of his office, to be a strictly personal decision for which no one but the 11A

Respondent in his personal capacity can be held responsible. As such, it was

contended that there is no cause to hold the State liable in the instant application.

49. Having considered the totality of the submissions made by the Counsel, it is apparent

that what seemed a singular and straightforward question has proliferated into many

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 306

facets. In the interest of confronting the most fundamental of issues in perspective

without being distracted by frills and frippery, I wish to crystallize the issues before us

in the following questions, which I shall proceed to answer in the course of this

judgment in no particular order:

Firstly, it needs to be considered whether or not it was necessary for the

constitutional procedure to be followed anew in granting the impugned 2nd

Pardon to the 2nd Respondent, seeing as his sentence of death had been

commuted to one of life imprisonment by the 1st Pardon. This is the most

pertinent question insofar as the procedural requirements are concerned. In

answering this question, decrypting the nature and effect of a presidential

pardon under Article 34 is of the essence;

Secondly is the question which I consider the greatest in magnitude, both in

terms of its effect on the instant application as well as constitutional

significance: is the power of pardon under Article 34 amenable to judicial review

only insofar as procedural irregularities? To put it in the simplest of terms, can

this Court inquire into the merits of the President’s decision and what are the

standards of review applicable? This must necessarily be considered in view of

the learned Additional Solicitor General’s submission that this power is of a sui

generis nature;

Thirdly, questions were also raised as to the exact nature of the requirements

contemplated in the proviso to Article 34(1) and how such requirements must

be interpreted. I shall proceed to answer this question in my analysis of the

factual circumstances relating to the impugned Pardon as each element is taken

up for consideration; and

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 306

Finally, this Court was also invited to consider whether or not it was necessary

to set out guidelines to be followed in the exercise of this power vested in the

President under Article 34.

BACKGROUND OF THE IMPUGNED PRESIDENTIAL PARDON

50. Given the intricacy and sensitivity of the matters before us, it is apropos that we are

wise to the entire context of the impugned Pardon, starting from the crime itself

leading up to the Petition before us.

51. The 2nd Respondent, Don Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha, was indicted before

the High Court of Colombo for the murder of Yvonne Johnson, who was only 19 years

old at the time of her death. On 01st July 2005, the body of Yvonne was discovered,

lying in a pool of her own blood, on the 19th-floor stairway of the Royal Park

Apartment Complex, where her family had made home. By judgment dated 28th July

2006, the learned Judge of the High Court, having arrived at the irrefutable and

inescapable inference that the accused himself perpetrated the barbarity leading to

her untimely demise—primarily on account of, inter alia, a palm impression of the

accused in blood, which was proven to be of the deceased—found him guilty of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to a term of 12 years

rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 300,000 moreover.1

52. Aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction, the 2nd Respondent preferred an appeal. The

Hon. Attorney-General, too, in a move not before seen, appealed against the

conviction of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, canvassing the same be

quashed in favour of a conviction of murder. The principal position of the Hon.

Attorney-General was that the 2nd Respondent had harboured the most conspicuous

murderous intention towards the deceased and that the evidence led at the trial was

1 HC Colombo Case No. 2722/2005

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 306

more than sufficient to establish his criminal liability for the offence of murder beyond

reasonable doubt.

53. The Court of Appeal, in a single consolidated judgment spanning 33 pages, following

a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the evidence, dismissed the appeal of the

2nd Respondent while allowing the appeal of the Hon. Attorney-General.2 The Court

of Appeal, in this analysis, noted how the head of the deceased had been bashed on

the edge of a step more than once, causing it to be disfigured beyond virtual

recognition, as well as the findings of the Judicial Medical Officer to the effect that

the cause of death had been strangulation by the deceased’s own stretch pants used

as a ligature having contorted her body and bending her legs backwards.

54. The defence of grave and sudden provocation taken up by the accused-appellant was

described by the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal as “most untenable and

hilarious if not ludicrous”.3 Accordingly, seeing the ferocity of the offence and its

meditated nature, by judgment dated 11th July 2012, the Court of Appeal quashed the

decision of the learned High Court Judge and found the 2nd Respondent guilty of

murder and sentenced him to death.

55. The 2nd Respondent sought to have the said conviction by the Court of Appeal

reversed by way of a Special Leave to Appeal Application before the Supreme Court.

However, the Supreme Court dismissed the Application, affirming the findings of the

Court of Appeal and the sentence of death.

56. Thereafter, in May 2016, the sentence of death imposed upon the 2nd Respondent

was commuted to one of life imprisonment by a Presidential Pardon (1st Pardon),

purportedly in pursuance of the recommendations made by the then Minister of

2 vide Don. Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v. Hon. Attorney-General C.A. 303/2006 and CALA 321/06, C.A. Minutes of 11 July 2012, now reported as (2012) 2 Sri LR 236

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 306

Justice, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC, who is also the Minister of Justice at the time

of this hearing. It is noteworthy that this 1st Pardon was a group pardon whereby the

sentences of 70 death row convicts, including that of the 2nd Respondent, were

commuted to life en masse.

57. In November 2019, less than a decade into the sentence of death imposed upon the

convict by the Court of Appeal, the 11A Respondent, in the final weeks of his

presidency, granted the impugned Presidential Pardon (2nd Pardon) to the convict

purportedly exercising his powers under Article 34 of the Constitution. As a result, the

2nd Respondent was released from prison on 08th November 2019.

58. Despite interim orders being issued to prevent the 2nd Respondent from fleeing the

jurisdiction, as prayed for by the Petitioner when the matter was taken up for support

on 29th November 2019, it was later revealed by the Controller General of Immigration

and Emigration by affidavit dated 05th December 2019 that the 2nd Respondent had

departed to Singapore on 15th November 2019, having obtained his passport soon

after the impugned 2nd Pardon on 14th November 2019.

59. The written submissions of the Hon. Attorney-General very helpfully included

therewith a timeline of events, which brings much needed perspicuity to what is

clearly a haphazard sequence of conduct. The same is produced hereinbelow, mutatis

mutandis, for the sake of clarity.

Respondent

TECHNICAL OBJECTION OF THE 11A RESPONDENT

60. Before I answer any of the questions before us, I wish to first dispense with the

technical objections raised by the 11A Respondent in his final written submissions

dated 25th August 2023. The 11A Respondent invited the Court’s notice to the fact

that one of the necessary parties, as highlighted during the submissions, viz. the

incumbent Minister of Justice Hon. Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC —who was also the

Minister of Justice at the time of granting the impugned Pardon—has not been made

party to the instant application. On this basis, it was pleaded that this application be

dismissed in limine for want of necessary parties.

61. As held by Amerasinghe J. in Samanthilaka v. Ernest Perera,4

“The person who has infringed or is likely to infringe a fundamental or language

right is not a necessary party in the sense in which that phrase is used in

connection with ordinary civil litigation. The failure to make a person who is

alleged to have violated or is likely to violate a fundamental or language right a

4 [1990] 1 Sri LR 318

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 33 of 306

respondent in a petition for relief under Article 126 of the Constitution is not, in

my view, a fatal defect.” 5

62. It must be borne in mind that, in applications under Article 126, this Court is not

adjudicating upon the rights of Petitioners as against the Respondents. The central

concern is whether there has been an infringement or imminent infringement of

fundamental rights by executive or administrative action. The failure to name a person

who may have personified such action as a respondent should not be deemed fatal

to an application under Article 126, unless such failure prevents this Court from

deciding the questions before it fairly and effectively.

63. Even where it so appears that the State or any person, named or unnamed, is

prejudiced by such failure, it would not be in the interest of justice to dismiss an

application in limine or in toto merely by virtue of such failure, especially where the

case is of great constitutional significance. The constitutional guarantees afforded to

the populace and the constitutional duties imposed upon this Court must always take

precedence over mere technicalities and procedural rules. The more appropriate

course of action in such an instance would be to join them as a party and grant a fair

and complete hearing, so as to meaningfully inquire into potential violations of

fundamental rights, for such is the constitutional duty of this Court.

64. In the instant application, I do not see this failure as one which prejudicially affects

any party. The Petitioner at no point challenged any actions by the then Minister of

Justice, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC; and the 06th Respondent (Minister of Justice)

was represented by the Attorney-General. With regards to the conduct of the 11A

Respondent, the advice or recommendation given by the then Minister of Justice is

5 ibid at 325

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 34 of 306

only relevant insofar as it appears on the record, and the records have been produced

for the perusal of this Court.

65. I wish to distract this judgment no further by this objection, for it is but a frivolous

one considering the nature of the questions before us, and the same is therefore

rejected.

POWER OF PARDON/ PREROGATIVE OF MERCY/ EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY

Cognate and Analogous Law

66. In early Britain, when an absolute monarch reigned with virtually unfettered power,

the power of pardon, like all prerogative power, was often misused. Kings frequently

used pardons as partisan indulgences and for other self-serving ends, such as to

consolidate power. It is said that pardons were often sold during the time of Edward

II. Be that as it may, for they are clearly past such reprehensible undemocratic

traditions, though one might legitimately question if we are.

67. In the present-day United Kingdom, too, the power of pardon exists in the form of

the royal prerogative of mercy. This power is exercised by the Crown on the advice of

the Justice Secretary. The establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907 and

the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) on 31st March 1997, by virtue of

Section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (UK), which provides a mechanism to refer

possible miscarriages of justice to the criminal courts of appeal, has considerably

diminished the need to exercise the prerogative of mercy.

68. Earlier views of the English Courts saw this power as one not amenable to judicial

review.6 Although the landmark House of Lords decision in Council of Civil Service

6 Horwitz v. Connor [1908] 6 CLR 38; Ex parte Kinally [1958] CrimLR 474; Hanratty v. Lord Butler [1971] 115 SJ 386; de Freitas v. Benny [1976] AC 239; Thomas v. R [1980] AC 125; R v. Toohey, ex parte Northern Land Council [1981] 151 CLR 170.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 35 of 306

Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (GCHQ Case) (1985)7 conclusively

recognized the potential for judicial review of the exercise of prerogative powers

where the subject matter of the power is justiciable, it, too, did not recognize the

exercise or non-exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy as reviewable; for Lord

Roskill plainly included the prerogative of mercy in the list of powers His Lordship felt

to be non-justiciable.8

69. The tide changed with the decision in R v. Secretary of State for the Home

Department, ex parte Bentley (1994),9 where the Home Secretary’s decision to

reject a claim for a posthumous free pardon was successfully reviewed on the basis

that he had erred in law in his failure to consider the grant of a conditional pardon in

making the decision. Even though Bentley did not necessarily amount to a major

doctrinal transformation, it effectively established some level of judicial scrutiny over

the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in the English setting.

70. In the United States, the power of clemency, or the power to pardon federal crimes,

is vested with the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1

of the United States Constitution, except in cases of impeachment. Despite the earlier

breakaway from the British Monarchical tyranny, the framers of the American

Constitution have added to it this power, which is undeniably based on the British

king’s prerogative of mercy, in a rather potent form.

71. In the words of Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court in US v.

Wilson (1833),10

“The power of pardon in criminal cases had been exercised from time immemorial

7 [1985] AC 374.

by the executive of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose

judicial institutions ours bear a close resemblance. We adopt their principles

respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for the

rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would

avail himself of it. A pardon is an act of grace, proceeding from the power

entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual on whom

it is bestowed from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed.

It is the private though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the

individual for whose benefit it is intended and not communicated

officially to the court.”

72. While the true extent of the power remains constitutionally unresolved, it is no longer

conceived by the US Courts as a private act of grace as the learned Chief Justice has.

In Biddle v. Perovich (1927),11 Justice Holmes opined that “…[a] pardon in our days

is not a private act of grace from and individual happening to possess power. It is part

of the Constitutional scheme. When granted, it is the determination of the ultimate

authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the

judgment fixed…”.

73. In New Zealand, the Governor-General retains the power to exercise the royal

prerogative of mercy as set out in the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of the

Governor-General 1983, being His Majesty’s Representative in New Zealand, acts on

the advice of the Minister of Justice. When it comes to potential miscarriages of

justice, just as in the UK, the Criminal Cases Review Commission established by the

Criminal Cases Review Commission Act of 2019 (NZ), has the authority to refer a

conviction to courts for review, which was formerly within the purview of the

Governor-General. No authority is empowered to perform such a function under the

11 274 U.S. 480 at 274

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 37 of 306

existing legal framework in Sri Lanka once the appeal process has been exhausted.

Jurisprudence emanating from New Zealand, too, recognizes the prerogative of mercy

as being amenable to judicial review.

74. In Australia, the royal prerogative of mercy is exercisable by the Governor-General or

the Governor of a state, under the advice of the Attorney-General and the Executive

Council, as the case may be. Each state and territory have enacted legislation which

enables convictions and/or sentences to be reviewed, like in the UK and New Zealand,

after the appeal process has been exhausted.

75. When it comes to India, the power to grant pardon exists as part of the constitutional

scheme. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution provides for the President to “grant

pardon, reprieve, respite or remission punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the

sentence of any person convicted of any offence…”.

76. But the President of India cannot act upon his or her own whims and fancies as the

exercise of this power is to be necessarily guided by the Home Minister and the

Council of Ministers per Article 74(1) of the Indian Constitution, and, according to the

jurisprudence emanating from India, it is also susceptible to judicial review. Article

161 of the Indian Constitution grants similar powers to State Governors in regard to

persons convicted of any offence against any law relating to matters to which the

executive power of such state extends.

77. Though the learned Counsel have relied on authorities from many jurisdictions as

persuasive precedents, it is unnecessary for this Court to take upon the arduous task

of examining in detail the power of mercy/pardon/clemency, or whatever else it may

be called, in these jurisdictions. Though that may be so, even a momentary look makes

it palpably apparent that the jurisprudence emanating from these jurisdictions have

evolved to better complement the Rule of Law and the democratic ideals.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 38 of 306

78. It is also apparent that many issues which have never been brought before this Court

have already been considered in detail by courts overseas. While we ought to be

mindful of preserving the values of our own distinct constitutional framework, we

might derive vital assistance, as appropriate, being attentive to the circumstances

affecting a court’s decision, for some of the decisions offer strong persuasive analyses

that are very much consistent with the scheme of our own Constitution.

79. Under our law, like in India, the pardoning power exercised by the President exists as

part of the constitutional scheme. The chief variance between our law and that of

India is the manner in which such power is fettered. The President of India must

exercise his power under Article 72 of the Indian Constitution on the advice of the

Central Government, and he is bound by such advice; whereas in Sri Lanka, the proviso

to Article 34(1) provides for special procedure to be followed in pardoning offenders

sentenced to death, while no such specific provisions are given for sentences short of

death.

Relevant Provisions Under the Constitution of Sri Lanka

80. As Ceylon left behind its colonial past and the prerogative of the British Crown

concerned us no longer, it is in the First Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka that this

power received express recognition as part of the constitutional scheme.

81. Article 22(2) of the 1972 Constitution set out the executive power of pardon as follows:

“The President may in the case of any offender convicted of any offence in any

court within the Republic of Sri Lanka –

(a) grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions;

(b) grant any respite, either indefinite for such period as the President may

think fit, of the execution of any sentence passed on such offender;

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 39 of 306

(c) substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment imposed

on such offender; or

(d) remit the whole or any part of any punishment imposed or of any penalty

or forfeiture otherwise due to the Republic on account of such offence.

Provided that where any offender shall have been condemned to suffer death by

the sentence of any court, the President shall cause a report to be made to him

by the judge who tried the case and shall forward such report to the Attorney-

General with instructions that after the Attorney-General has advised thereon, the

report shall be sent together with the Attorney-General’s advice to the Minister

whose function it is to advise the President on the exercise of the said

powers.”

82. Article 34 and Article 154B(9) of the Second Republican Constitution exhaustively set

out the power of pardon within the existing Sri Lankan constitutional order.

83. Article 34 of the 1978 Constitution provides;

(1) “The President may in the case of any offender convicted of any offence in

any court within the Republic of Sri Lanka —

(a) grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions;

(b) grant any respite, either indefinite or for such period as the

President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence passed

on such offender;

(c) substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment

imposed on such offender; or

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 40 of 306

(d) remit the whole or any part of any punishment imposed or of

any penalty or forfeiture otherwise due to the Republic on

account of such offence.

Provided that where any offender shall have been condemned to

suffer death by the sentence of any court, the President shall cause a report

to be made to him by the Judge who tried the case and shall forward such

report to the Attorney-General with instructions that after the Attorney-

General has advised thereon, the report shall be sent together with the

Attorney-General’s advice to the Minister in charge of the subject of Justice,

who shall forward the report with his recommendations to the President.

(2) The President may in the case of any person who is or has become subject to

any disqualification specified in paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) or Article 89

or sub-paragraph (g) of Paragraph (1) of Article 91 –

(a) a grant of pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions; or

(b) reduce the period of such disqualification.

(3) When any offence has been committed for which the offender may be tried

within the Republic of Sri Lanka, the President may grant a pardon to any

accomplice in such offence who shall give such information as shall lead to

the conviction of the principal offender or of any one of such principal

offenders, if more than one.”12

84. Article 154B(9) provides;

“Without prejudice to the powers of the President under Article 34 and subject to

his directions the Governor of a Province shall have the power to grant a pardon

12 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 41 of 306

to every person convicted of an offence against a statute made by the Provincial

Council of that Province or a law made by Parliament on a matter in respect of

which the Provincial Council has power to make statutes and to grant a respite

or remission of punishment imposed by Court on any such person.

Provided that where the Governor does not agree with the advice of the

Board of Ministers in any case and he considers it necessary to do so in the public

interest, he may refer that case to the President for orders.”

85. Article 34 makes it abundantly clear that the President of the Republic is vested with

wide constitutional power and discretion with regard to the exercise of pardoning

power; but, like in other jurisdictions, not without limitations. The framers of the

Constitution have sought to significantly fetter such power and discretion to grant a

pardon with regards to offenders condemned to death, by virtue of the proviso to

Article 34(1).

86. The proviso establishes additional legal procedures to be followed where an offender

“condemned to suffer death by the sentence of any court” is to be pardoned. In effect,

this procedure is an additional constitutional safeguard to ensure that the Presidential

Pardon is not lightly granted to those who have been convicted of the most heinous

of crimes.

87. N.S. Bindra’s Interpretation of Statutes (8th Ed) states as follows:

“It is an established rule that constitutional provisions are to be construed as

mandatory unless, by express provision or by necessary implication, a different

intention is manifest. [State v. Gordon, 158 SW 683] Some cases even go so far to

hold that all constitutional provisions are mandatory. [Nesbit v. Peo, 36 at p. 121;

State v. Hitchcock, 146 SW 40] But more accurately, the test as to whether a

provision is mandatory or directory is the intention of those who framed and

adopted it. [Clark v. Los Angeles, 116 at p. 722] This intention is to be gathered

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 42 of 306

not so much from a technical construction of particular words, as from a

consideration of the language and purpose of the entire clause. [State v. Burrow,

104 SW 526] There is a strong presumption in favour of its being mandatory

[Merwin v. Fusell, 124 SW 1021]…” 13

88. The express and specific inclusion of a special procedure that is only applicable to

offenders sentenced to death, and the language employed in the provision, such as

the repeated use of the term ‘shall’, amply manifest the legislative intention to create

a special safeguard which must mandatorily be followed.

89. N.S. Bindra (supra) further provides that;

“Where powers, rights or immunities are granted with a direction that certain

regulations, formalities or conditions shall be complied with, it seems neither

unjust nor inconvenient to exact a rigorous observance of them as essential to the

acquisition of the right or authority conferred and it is, therefore, probable that

such was the intentions of the Legislature [Bai Kamla v. Mane, AIR 1966 Guj 37,

39 (Mehta, J.), quoting Maxwell on interpretation, 1962 Ed. at p. 364]….”14

“.…When a power is given under a statute to do a certain thing in a certain way

the thing must be done in that way or not at all. The other modes of performance

are necessarily forbidden. [Madho Singh v. Hira Lal, 1983 MPWN 281] Where

authority is granted to public officers to do a thing in a certain way, the manner

of doing the thing is mandatory, or jurisdictional, and a limitation on the authority

of the officer, even though the doing of the thing in the first place may be

discretionary [Sutherland: Statutory Construction, 3rd Ed., Vol., III at p. 89]…”15

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 43 of 306

90. In light of this, I have no qualm holding that the procedural requirements set out in

the said proviso can only be interpreted as preconditions to granting a presidential

pardon to an offender sentenced to death by any competent court of law. Failure to

comply with this procedure established by law in granting a pardon would ipso facto

make such pardon ultra vires and void ab initio. Therefore, it is imperative that this

procedure be followed in granting a presidential pardon to a prisoner sentenced to

death for such pardon to be of any validity.

91. None of the parties who were represented before this Court made any submissions

contrary to this finding.

Other Legal Provisions for Remission and Commutation of Sentences Under the

Laws of Sri Lanka

92. The learned Additional Solicitor General placed before this Court a list of legal

provisions in our law which set out supplementary procedures enabling remission and

commutation of prisoners. I must note that many of these provisions were only

included in the written submissions dated 09th August 2023, but were not once

brought to this Court’s cognizance during the hearing.

93. Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 and the Prisons

Ordinance, No. 16 of 1877 provide for the suspensions, remissions and commutation

of sentences.

94. Sections 311 and 312 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act provide as follows:

“Section 311 – (President may suspend or remit sentence on conditions)

(1) When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an offence

the President may, at any time without conditions or upon any

conditions which the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 44 of 306

of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to

which he has been sentenced.

(2) Whenever an application is made to the President for the suspension or

remission of a sentence the President may require the presiding judge of

the court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed to state

his opinion as to whether the application should be granted or refused

together with his reasons for such opinion.

(3) If the person in whose favour a sentence has been suspended or remitted

fails to fulfill the conditions prescribed by the President, the President

may cancel such suspension or remission; whereupon such person may

if at large be arrested by any police officer without warrant and

remanded by a Magistrate's Court to undergo the unexpired portion of

the sentence.

(4) Anything herein contained shall not be deemed to interfere with

the right of the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or

remissions of punishment.”16

“Section 312 – (President may commute sentence)

The President may, without the consent of the person sentenced, commute

any one of the following sentences for any of the commuted sentences

indicated in the corresponding entry: -

Sentence Commuted Sentence

Death Rigorous or simple imprisonment for life or for

any other term

16 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 45 of 306

Rigorous Imprisonment Any lesser term of rigorous imprisonment, or

any term of simple imprisonment not

exceeding the term to which such person

might have been sentenced, or fine

Simple imprisonment Any lesser term of simple imprisonment, or

fine”

95. The learned Additional Solicitor General highlighted the words contained in Section

311(4) to buttress his position that these procedures exist independently of the

powers under Article 34(1). However, as one might observe, it states therein that

anything in this Section shall not be deemed to interfere with the powers of the

President under Article 34. Although that may be constitutionally valid and true, the

converse of this proposition can never be accepted. Where a constitutional provision

and ordinary laws cover the same plane, the constitutional provision, by its very

nature, has a supervening effect on such ordinary laws.

96. Therefore, it is axiomatic that the exercise of the powers entrusted upon the President

under the aforementioned provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act must

necessarily be subject to Article 34 of the Constitution as well as all such limitations

Article 34 itself is subject to.

97. Section 58 of the Prisons Ordinance, No. 16 of 1877 as amended by Ordinance No. 53

of 1939 provides,

“Section 58 – (Remission of sentences and rewards for good conduct)

A remission of sentence, or a gratuity or privileges, according to such scales

as may be prescribed by rules under section 94, may be earned by industry

and good conduct by any prisoner who is undergoing a sentence of

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 46 of 306

imprisonment of either description for a term in the aggregate exceeding

one month.

Provided, however, that this section shall not apply to-

(a) a civil prisoner; or

(b) a person committed to prison under Chapter VII of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979.

(c) a person committed to prison to serve the unexpired portion of any

sentence of imprisonment or preventive detention upon the forfeiture

or revocation of a licence to be at large under the Prevention of

Crimes Ordinance.”

98. Section 94 of the Prisons Ordinance empowers the Ministers to make all such rules,

not inconsistent with the Prisons Ordinance or any other written law relating to

prisons, as may be necessary for the administration of the prisons and for carrying

out or giving effect to the provisions and principles of the Prisons Ordinance. Rule 40

of the rules so promulgated provides as follows:

“On the completion of the fourth, eights, twelfth, fifteenth and twentieth years,

respectively, of the term of imprisonment of every prisoner, irrespective of age,

the Superintendent of the prison shall forward to the Commissioner, for the

consideration of the Governor General, a report upon all points having a material

bearing on the question of the remission of sentence, including the condition of

the prisoner, his demeanor, his attitude towards his offence and towards crime

generally, his conduct and industry, and his fitness for resuming the

responsibilities and normal avocations of citizenship together with a report from

the Medical Officer of the prison upon the mental and physical condition of the

prisoner, with particular reference to the effect of the imprisonment upon his

health. When a prisoner has served twenty years in prison his case shall be

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 47 of 306

submitted for the consideration of the Governor-General once in every twelve

months.”

99. In addition, Rule 235(1) provides that,

“Every prisoner shall be entitled to send, shortly after his conviction, one petition

to the Governor on matters connected with his trial or conviction. A prisoner shall

be permitted to send an additional petitioner if in the opinion of the

Superintendent there are special circumstances, or if the prisoner was not aware

of the certain facts at the time of the first petition, or if the prisoner has been more

than one year in prison and not less than one year has elapsed since the date of

his last petition.”

100. The learned Additional Solicitor General further submitted for the perusal of this Court

Rules 298 to 306 as being relevant for the allocation of marks for the purposes of

remission.

101. It is evident that these provisions under the Prisons Ordinance were promulgated well

before any of our autochthonous constitutions were even conceived. But they

continue to remain in force as provided by Articles 168(1) and 170 of the Constitution.

102. According to Article 170,

“‘existing law’ and ‘existing written law’ mean any law and written law,

respectively, in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution

which under the Constitution continue in force”;

“‘law’ means any Act of Parliament and any law enacted by any legislature at any

time prior to the commencement of the Constitution and includes an Order in

Council”; and

“‘written law’ means any law and subordinate legislation [and includes statutes

made by a Provincial Council, Orders], Proclamations, Rules, By-laws and

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 48 of 306

Regulations made or issued by any body or person having power or authority

under any law to make or issue the same.”

103. Article 168(1) provides that which continues in force under the Constitution as follows:

“Unless Parliament otherwise provides, all laws, written laws and unwritten laws,

in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, shall, mutatis

mutandis and except as otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution,

continue in force”.17

104. The learned Additional Solicitor General also invited the Court to be mindful of the

effect of Article 16(1) in this regard. Article 16(1) of the Constitution provides,

“All existing written law and unwritten law shall be valid and operative

notwithstanding any inconsistency with the preceding provisions of this

Chapter”18

105. It is to be noted that Article 168(1) does not universally validate all laws in force

immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, but only validates such

pre-existing laws which are not inconsistent with the express provisions of the

Constitution.

106. If the Prisons Ordinance provided for any procedures which could be conceived as

independent and as of like effect and nature to Article 34, such procedure would be

vitiated by the Constitution coming into force. As such, the procedures under the

Prisons Ordinance can only remain in force inasmuch as the same are able to

harmoniously operate within the constitutional scheme. Article 16(1) saves the

17 Emphasis is mine

18 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 49 of 306

provisions only from invalidation on the ground of inconsistency with fundamental

rights and does not extend to Article 34 or any other provision of the Constitution.

107. However, the aforementioned provisions of the Prisons Ordinance, including the rules

promulgated thereunder, do not appear to be at variance with the power of pardon

as contemplated in the Constitution. They, too, much like Sections 311 and 312 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, appear to complement the power of pardon under

Article 34 rather than being parallel and independent.

108. Considering the aforementioned, although the learned Additional Solicitor General

referred to the procedures under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Prisons

Ordinance as parallel to Article 34 of the Constitution, they are not to be conceived

as functioning independently or separately. Such parallel and independent

procedures may exist elsewhere, but in the context of the Sri Lankan corpus juris, such

procedures complement and exist as ancillaries to the constitutional provisions—not

in addition.

109. Hence, it is my view that all such laws which provide for the President or any officer

of the State to pardon, remit, commute or otherwise interfere with the sentence of

any prisoner must necessarily be subject to the mandates of Article 34. Furthermore,

the exercise of any power granted by such provisions must be bound by the same

principles and restrictions as the President may be in the exercise of his or her power

under Article 34 of the Constitution; for any of the aforesaid legal provisions to enable

a circuitous route whereby constitutional mandates can be effectively

circumnavigated would be repugnant to the basic tenets of constitutionalism.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 50 of 306

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act

110. As it was the subject of extensive discussion, I see it fit to place special focus on the

relevance of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act,

No. 4 of 2015.19 At the time of delivering this judgment, Act No. 4 of 2015 was repealed

and replaced by the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses

Act, No. 10 of 2023. However, it is the former which was operational at the time of

granting the impugned Pardon. All references I have made hereinbelow are to the

2015 Act, unless otherwise specified.

111. Section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act,

No. 4 of 2015 provided,

“[Section] 3.

A victim of crime shall have the right:—

…

(q) in the event of any person in authority considering the grant of a pardon

or remission of sentence imposed on any person convicted of having

committed an offence, to receive notice thereof and submit through the

Authority to the person granting such pardon or remission, the manner

in which the offence committed had impacted on his life including his

body, state of mind, employment, profession or occupation, income,

quality of life, property and any other aspects concerning his life.”

112. The Petitioner contended that, by virtue of this provision, a duty has been cast upon

any authority considering pardon to give notice of such pardon to any victims of an

offence with respect to which the potential grantee of the pardon was convicted; and

asserted that the 11A Respondent had acted in breach of this duty in granting the

19 Hereinafter at times referred to as the ‘Victim and Witness Protection Act’ for convenience

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 51 of 306

impugned Pardon. All President's Counsel appearing for the Respondents agreed with

the Petitioner in this regard, save for the 11A Respondent and the Attorney-General.

113. The learned Additional Solicitor General maintained that Section 3(q) of the Act

should not be construed as mandatory, as that would be to impliedly amend the

Constitution. The crux of his position was that, since Article 34(1) has expressly

provided for the procedure to be followed in granting a pardon, for the Victim and

Witness Protection Act to stipulate additional mandatory procedure would be

tantamount to impliedly amending the proviso to Article 34(1) by an Act of

Parliament. And this, he asserted to be blatantly unconstitutional.

114. The learned Additional Solicitor General invited this Court’s cognizance towards

Article 82(1) of the Constitution, according to which,

“No Bill for the amendment of any provision of the Constitution shall be placed

on the Order Paper of Parliament, unless the provision to be repealed, altered or

added, and consequential amendments, if any, are expressly specified in the Bill

and is described in the long title thereof as being an Act for the amendment of

the Constitution.”

115. In light of this, he submitted that if the Petitioner’s contention is accepted, the Victim

and Witness Protection Act would have the effect of adding to the procedural

requirements under Article 34(1), although it did not, at the Bill stage, abide by the

requirements of Article 82(1). While contending Section 3(q) of the Victim and Witness

Protection Act to be ex facie inconsistent with Article 34 of the Constitution, he did

not, however, seek to challenge the same in light of Article 80(3), which precludes

post-enactment judicial review of legislation; but rather invited the Court to adopt a

harmonious interpretation, considering Article 84(1) and Article 84(3).

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 52 of 306

116. Article 84 provides,

(1) “A Bill which is not for the amendment of any provision of the Constitution or

for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, but which is inconsistent

with any provision of the Constitution may be placed on the Order Paper of

Parliament without complying with the requirements of paragraph (1) or

paragraph (2) of Article 82.

…

(3) Such a Bill when enacted into law shall not, and shall not be deemed to,

amend, repeal or replace the Constitution or any provision thereof, and shall

not be so interpreted or construed, and may thereafter be repealed by a

majority of the votes of the Members present and voting.”

117. As such, the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that Section 3(q) of the

Victim and Witness Protection Act is to be interpreted as directory rather than

mandatory to avoid inconsistency with the provisions of the Constitution, for the

constitutional provisions must always prevail over any other law.

118. In support, he submitted a passage from Southern Provincial Co-Operative

Employee's Service Commission v. Bentota Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society

Ltd. & others,20 where Janak De Silva J. opined as follows:

“…If there is indeed a conflict, clearly the constitutional provision prevails as the

Grundnorm in the sense propounded by Kelson…”21

119. In spite of finding merit in this submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General,

I find myself unable to unreservedly align with it. While Article 34(1) provides for

several requirements to be met in granting a pardon, I do not see how such

20 CA/PHC/71/2013, C.A. Minutes of 09/08/2018 (‘Bentota Multi-Purpose Case’)

21 ibid at 5

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 53 of 306

requirements can be interpreted as exhaustive. The language of Article 34(1) makes

no such suggestion. As was observed with regards to the ancillary procedure in the

Prisons Ordinance and Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the mere constitutional

recognition of a thing does not render nugatory all such other legal provisions that

may come within its ambit.

120. Keeping with the contemporary drifts in constitutional interpretation, it is axiomatic

that constitutional provisions are to be given a dynamic interpretation, whereby not

only the purpose of a statute but also the prevailing legal, moral and societal norms

are better appreciated. In considering whether a statutory provision is inconsistent

with the Constitution, the appropriate test must be whether such statutory provision

and its purpose are at variance with the basic structure of the Constitution and the

norms embodied therein. A more inapt approach I cannot imagine to such

consideration than a purely semantic one. Where the purpose and rationale of a

statute are homogenous with that of the Constitution, I do not see why linguistic

indifferences should disrupt their harmony.

121. The extract from the Bentota Multi-Purpose Case (supra), does not for a moment

suggest the force of a statute be diluted at the first sign of conflict with a constitutional

provision. Where the excerpt quoted above is interpreted literally and restrictively,

without due regard to the linguistic milieu of the Kelsonian theory, it might well

manifest such a fallacy. In truth, as it appears to me, it only dictates that where there

is an actual inconsistency, the Grundnorm to postulate the constitutional norms as

supreme over other legal norms and their corresponding legal provisions. This stands

an utterly sensible proposition as the constitutional norms more closely reflect the

sovereign will of the people. However, where the inferior norms resonate with a

superior norm, the latter only augments the efficacy of the former.

122. I see no conflict between Section 3(q) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act and

Article 34(1) of the Constitution. Just as the legislature has legitimately enacted

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 54 of 306

ancillary procedures to make the power under Article 34 more meaningful, it may

likewise tighten its limitations so far as it lends itself to the constitutional scheme.

123. In this regard, Surasena J. has made a similar observation in Hirunika Premachandra

v. Attorney-General and Others: 22

“I agree that the provisions of the Constitution must prevail over the provisions of

any general law. The questions as to which prevails, whether the provisions in the

Constitution or the provisions in general law, would arise only when they are in

conflict with each other. In this situation I see no conflict between the provisions

in Article 34 and Section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses Act… They certainly can co-exist together.”23

124. As such, I am of the opinion that Section 3(q) of the Act is to be interpreted as

mandatory and as complimenting the non-exhaustive requirements set out under the

proviso to Article 34(1), for the Section underpins the purpose of the said proviso.

125. Despite this conclusion, one must not close their mind to the constitutional

significance of the submissions made by the learned Additional Solicitor General in

this regard. The legislature is by no means empowered to change, amend or otherwise

affect the force of a constitutional provision by a mere enactment without complying

with the requirements set out in Article 84 of the Constitution. As the learned

Additional Solicitor General very aptly observed, where there is a material

inconsistency between a statutory provision and the purpose of a constitutional

provision, the Court is to presume that the legislature did not intend to contravene

the provisions of the Constitution and the statute must be interpreted accordingly.

22 SC FR 221/2021; SC FR 225/2021; SC FR 228/2021, S.C. Minutes of 17 January 2024

23 ibid at 52

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 55 of 306

126. Moreover, the conclusion I have arrived at should not be stretched to such illogical

ends as a means to circumvent Article 84 of the Constitution. The statutory provision

in question only retains its mandatory force on account of being consistent with the

purpose of Article 34.

127. Without prejudice to the argument which I have dispensed with above, the learned

President's Counsel for the 11A Respondent contended that ‘victim of crime’ as

contemplated in the Act included parents and guardians only where such offence is

committed against a ‘child victim’, and that a ‘child victim of crime’ as contemplated

in the Act included a person under the age of 18 years. With this interpretation, I

concur.

128. He then submitted that the parents and siblings of the 19-year-old, Yvonne, who was

the victim of the offence perpetrated by the 2nd Respondent, did not fall within the

definition, as she had attained the age of majority at the time of the offence. In

essence, he attempted to distinguish the circumstances of the impugned Pardon from

the ambit of the Act, be it mandatory or directory.

129. Under Section 45 of the 2015 Act, “victim of crime” and “child victim of crime” were

defined as follows:

““child victim of crime” and “child witness” respectively means, a person who is

less than eighteen years of age and who is either a victim of crime or is a

witness ;

…

“victim of crime” means a person including a child victim who has suffered any

injury, harm, impairment or disability whether physical or mental, emotional,

economic or other loss, as a result of an act or omission which constitutes an

alleged—

(a) offence under any law; or

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 56 of 306

(b) infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 13(1) or (2)

of the Constitution,

and includes a person who suffers harm as a result of intervening to assist such

a person or to prevent the commission of an offence, and the parent or guardian

of a child victim of crime and any member of the family and next of kin of such

person, dependents and any other person of significant importance to that

person…”24

130. A perusal of the provision indicates that it clearly recognises as a ‘victim of crime’

those directly affected, be it an adult or a child, by an act contemplated therein. Apart

from such directly affected persons, three other classes of persons are deemed a

‘victim of crime’ under the scheme of this Act:

i. Firstly, it includes such persons who intervene either to assist a directly

affected person or to prevent the commission of the offence, and suffer

harm as a result;

ii. Secondly, it includes the parent or guardian of a child victim of crime, any

member of the family and next of kin or such child victim of crime; and

iii. Thirdly, this also includes dependents and any other person of significant

importance to a person directly affected.

131. The submission of the learned President's Counsel was in complete disregard of this

third class of persons, which certainly includes parents and siblings. I do not for once

think the legislature intended to exclude parents and siblings of a directly affected

person from this definition. The phrase “that person” in “dependents and any other

24 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 57 of 306

person of significant importance to that person”25 cannot be interpreted to mean a

child victim for the simple reason that a child victim cannot have legal dependents.

132. This position is made clearer under the more recent Assistance to and Protection of

Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 10 of 2023, where family members are

expressly given recognition. Section 104 defines a ‘victim of crime’ as follows:

“”victim of crime” means a person who has suffered any injury and includes, where

appropriate-

(a) a member of the family of the victim of crime or a dependent of the victim of

crime;

(b) a person of significant importance to a victim of crime;

(c) a person who suffers injury in intervening to assist a victim of crime;

(d) a person who suffers injury in preventing another person from victimization;

and

(e) a child victim of crime;

…”

133. Admittedly, the phraseology of these Acts, if strictly construed, can lead to much

difficulty. The phrase “any other person of significant importance” is certainly as

ambiguous as legislative language can get. If the executive is required by law to give

notice to all such persons who may have been of ‘significant importance’ to a direct

victim, the power of pardon would be rendered nugatory. The practical difficulties

which could arise out of such a broad interpretation are self-evident. Therefore, to

dispense with this burden imposed by the Victims and Witness Protection Act, it would

25 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 58 of 306

be sufficient for an authority considering pardon to be in substantial compliance with

the requirements of Section 3(q).

134. Where no attempt is made to dispense with this burden, the effect of which is to

exclude the victims of a crime from the process of granting pardon, such failure alone

may be capable of vitiating the validity of a pardon, depending on the circumstances.

135. In the South African Case of Albutt v. Centre for the Study of Violence and

Reconciliation and Others,26 the decision to so exclude the victim from the special

dispensation process was held irrational. It was stated that “…[t]he victims of these

crimes are entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard before the President make a

decision to grant a pardon under the special dispensation”.

136. Turning towards Section 5 of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act, No. 10 of 2023, it provides as follows:

“[Section] 5.

(1) A victim of crime shall have the right-

…

(f) in the event of any person in authority considering the grant of a pardon or

remission of sentence imposed on any person convicted of an offence, to

receive notice thereof and submit through the Authority to the person

granting such pardon or remission, the manner in which the offence

committed has impacted on such victim of crime physically, emotionally,

psychologically, financially, professionally or in any other manner;

…

26 CCT 54/09 [2010] at 74

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 59 of 306

(4) In the event the person in authority considering the grant of a pardon or

remission of sentence referred to in paragraph (f) of subsection (1) is the President,

the duty of informing the Authority of such fact for the purpose of giving notice

thereof to the victim of crime shall be on the Secretary to the President, and in

the event such person in authority is the Governor of a Province, such duty shall

be on the Secretary to the Governor of such Province.”

137. As can be seen, though Section 5(1)(f) of the 2023 Act is not a verbatim reproduction

of Section 3(q) of the 2015 Act, they are identical in substance and effect. As such, the

views I have expressed with regard to the 2015 Act can most certainly be extended,

mutatis mutandis, to the 2023 Act as well.

138. I wish to further note in this regard that, in spite of whether this provision is mandatory

or directory, it has the effect of creating a legitimate expectation to the effect that any

victim, as defined under the Act, would be given reasonable notice and afforded an

opportunity to speak their grievances. Where any authority acts in breach of such

legitimate expectation, that itself may, depending on the circumstances, vitiate the

validity of such pardon.

POWER OF PARDON: EFFECT

139. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term ‘pardon’ as “[a] formal remission, either

free or conditional, of the legal consequences of a crime; an action on the part of the

proper authority in a state, releasing an individual from the punishment imposed by

sentence or that is due according to law”.

140. The following passage from Bracton’s De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae,

from as far back as the mid-13th century, is said to be the earliest exposition as to the

effect of a pardon under the English law:

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 60 of 306

"But in all the aforesaid cases, whatever may have been the cause, when the

outlawry has been made duly and according to the law of the land, a

person is not restored except to the king's peace alone, that he may go and

return and contract anew, for that which has been dissolved by the outlawry

cannot be joined anew by the inlawry without a new intention on the part of those

who have contracted. For the king cannot grant a pardon with injury or

damage to others. He may give what is his own, that is his protection, which

the outlawed person has lost through his flight and contumacy, but that which

is another's he cannot give by his own grace. Likewise a person justly and

duly outlawed is not restored to anything except to the king's peace, that

he may go and return and have protection, but he cannot be restored to his rights

of action and other things, for he is like a new-born infant and a man as it

were lately born. Likewise inlawry does not restore a person to his previous

actions and obligations, nor to his homage nor fealties, nor to his oaths, nor to

other things dissolved by his outlawry, against the will of those by whose will they

were previously united and confirmed, and accordingly neither to his inheritances

nor to his tenements to the prejudice of the lords, and so they cannot be restored

to those things to which they had only a right. But no one is bound to them by

preceding obligations, but they are bound to all others, that they may not be in a

better condition on account of their outlawry, since they ought to be in a worse

condition."27

141. Henry de Bracton may have been somewhat ahead of his time in his juristic thinking,

and the passage may not speak of the effect of a pardon in so many words, but it

does reflect where the jurists were heading as regards the bounds of the king’s

27 Henry de Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, Twiss’s Translation, Vol. 2, at 371 as cited in Williston, ‘Does a Pardon Blot Out Guilt?’ (1915) Vol. 28 No. 7 Harvard Law Review 647, at 649 (Emphasis is mine)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 61 of 306

prerogative and is indicative of a new paradigm where a king was no longer an

omnipotent sovereign.

142. A more precise record of the effects of a pardon can be found in Halsbury’s Laws of

England (4th Ed), which states,

“The effect of a pardon under the Great Seal is to clear the person from all

infamy, and from all consequences of the offence for which it is granted[1],

and from all statutory or other disqualifications following upon conviction[2].

It makes him, as it were, a new man, so as to enable him to maintain an action

against any person afterwards defaming him in respect of the offence for which

he was convicted.[3]” 28

143. Support for this proposition runs as far back as the 17th century. Hawkins Pleas of

the Crown (7th Ed)29 states,

“I take it to be settled at this day, that the pardon of a treason or felony even after

a conviction of attainder, does so far clear the party from the infamy and all other

consequences of his crime, that he many not only have an action for a scandal in

28 Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th edn 1974) Vol 8, at para 952. (Emphasis is mine).

[1] Bac Abr, Pardon, H; Hay v Tower Division of London JJ (1890) 24 QBD 561 at 565; 2 Hale PC 278. The effect is confined to the offence for which it was granted: see R v Harrod (1846 2 Car & Kir 926).

[2] Hay v Tower Division of London JJ (1980) 24 QBD 561; Bennet v Easedale (1626) Cro Car 55. In the days when a conviction disqualified a man from being a witness, a pardon removed the disqualification: Fine’s Case (1623) Godb 288; R v Gully (1773) 1 Leach 98 at 99; 2 Hawk PC (1824 Edn) 547. The disqualification was removed in all cases by the Evidence Act 1843. As to the equitable claim of an accomplice who turns King’s evidence to the mercy of the Crown, see R v Rudd (1775) 1 Leach 115 at 121, 125.

calling him a traitor or felon after the time of the pardon, but may also be a good

witness notwithstanding the attainder or conviction; because the pardon makes

him as it were a new man; and gives him a new capacity and credit.”

144. And, as per Blackstone,

“A pardon by the king makes the offender a new man, and acquits him of all

corporal penalties and forfeitures annexed to that offence, for which he obtains

his pardon. But nothing can restore the blood, when once corrupted, if the pardon

be not allowed till after attainder, but the high power of parliament. Yet if a person

attainted receives the king’s pardon, and afterwards has a son, that man may be

heir to his father; because the father being made a new man, might transmit new

inheritable blood; but if he had been born before the pardon, he would never have

inherited at all.” 30

145. It is not inconceivable how one might misapprehend the aforementioned as denoting

the fallacy that a pardoned offender was to be regarded an innocent man as if he had

never committed the offence with respect to which he was pardoned; however, as a

more judicious mind might see, a more precise construction of the language takes us

far from it.

146. In Cuddington v. Wilkins (1615),31 the plaintiff brought an action against the

Defendant for calling him a thief after a pardon. It was held that the felony was extinct

by virtue of the pardon. Their Lordships said,

“[T]hough he were a thief once, yet when the pardon came, it took away not only,

poenam [penalty], but reatum [liability], for a felony is contra coronam et

30 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book IV, Chap. 31 in WM. Hardcastle Browne, A. M. (ed), Commentaries on The Laws of England, By Sir William Blackstone: In One Volume at p. 732

dignitatem regis [against the crown and the dignity of the King]. Now when the

king had discharged it, and pardoned him of it, he hath cleared the person of the

crime and infamy, wherein no private person is interested but the

Commonwealth, whereof he is the head, and in whom all general wrong reside,

and to whom the reformation of all general wrong belongs.” 32

147. The decision in Cuddington v. Wilkins may prima facie appear to reinforce the said

fallacy, but the most prudent observation of Hobart C.J., four years after in Searle v.

Williams,33 indicates a subtle but vital distinction to be drawn:

“It was said, that he could no more call him thief, in the present tense, than

to say a man hath the pox, or is a villain after he be cured or manumised, but

that he had been a thief or villain he might say.” 34

148. I am in full agreement with this observation by Hobart C.J., which appears to me as a

more precise interpretation of the old authorities. Although many subsequent

authorities greatly trouble any attempt to reconcile the position with regard to the

effect of a pardon in this manner, the more recent authorities reflect the same

approach as the one taken by Hobart C.J.

149. One troubling authority is Ex parte Garland,35 where Field J. held,

“A pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offence and the

guilt of the offender; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment

and blots out the existence of the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the

offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence… It removes

the penalties and disabilities, and restores him to all his civil rights. It makes him,

as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.” 36

150. The written submissions of the Hon. Attorney-General submitted, citing Ex parte

Garland, the following:

“Further, the effect of a presidential pardon was explained by the U.S. Supreme

Court in Ex Parte Garland 71 U.S (4 Wall.) 333 (1867) at 351:

…It is, therefore, within the power of the President to limit his pardon, as in

those cases in which it is individual and after conviction, to the mere release of

the penalty—it is equally within this prerogative to extend it so as to include a

whole class of offenders—to interpose this act of clemency before trial or

conviction; and not merely to take away the penalty, but to forgive and

obliterate the offence.” 37

151. The aforementioned passage is often cited erroneously by scholars as an explanation

by the Supreme Court of the United States, when it is, in fact, an argument made for

the petitioner, as recorded in the judgment. It appears that the learned Additional

Solicitor General, too, has been susceptible to the same error. Perusal of the Report

indicates that the arguments for the petitioner are recorded on pages 338 to 351,

whereas the arguments for the United States are recorded from pages 352 to 364. It

is not until page 374 of the Report that the opinion of the court is to be found.

152. While some subsequent cases have cited Ex parte Garland with approval, it has also

been the subject of much criticism. Many cases have found fault with its rationale and

36 ibid at 380 (Emphasis is mine)

37 Witten Submissions on behalf of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents dated 9th August 2023, para 35 (reproduced verbatim for accuracy)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 65 of 306

have refused to follow the same. As such, it can no longer be considered good

authority.

153. In re Spenser,38 Deady J. commenting on the case of Ex parte Garland (supra) states,

"And yet I do not suppose the opinion is to be understood as going the length of

holding that while the party is to be deemed innocent of the crime by reason of

the pardon from and after the taking effect thereof, that it is also to be deemed

that he never did commit the crime or was convicted of it. The effect of the

pardon is prospective and not retrospective. It removes the guilt and

restores the party to a state of innocence. But it does not change the past

and cannot annihilate the established fact that he was guilty of the

offence."

154. As noted by the Supreme Court of California in People v. Biggs,39

“It is universally established that a pardon exempts the individual from the

punishment which the law inflicts for the crime which he has committed; and

generally peaking it also removes any disqualifications or disabilities which would

ordinarily have followed from the conviction. To say, however, that the

offender is a ‘new man’ and ‘as innocent as if he had never committed an

offence’ is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal. A

person adjudged guilty of an offence is a convicted criminal, though pardoned he

may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard

him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though

it places no restraints upon him following his conviction. The criminal character

or habits of the individual, the chief postulate of habitual criminal statutes, is often

as clearly disclosed by a pardoned conviction as by one never condoned. The

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 66 of 306

broad generalizations quoted above are, if taken too literally, logically

unsound as well as historically questionable.”

155. In People v. Carlesi,40 the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York noted

that,

“The pardon of this defendant did not make "a new man" of him; it did not "blot

out" the fact or the record of his conviction, and of course, the Supreme Court,

in deciding that the Congress could not impinge upon the pardoning power of the

Executive did not intend to hold that the Executive could blot out a solemn record

of the judicial branch of government. (See Roberts v. State of New York, 30 App.

Div. 106; 160 N.Y. 217.) The pardon in this case merely restored the defendant to

his civil rights. If it had been granted before his term of imprisonment had been

served, it would also have relieved the defendant of that. But it did not

obliterate the record of his conviction or blot out the fact that he had been

convicted. (Matter of ____, an Attorney, 86 N.Y. 563.) It relieved the defendant

of the consequences which the law attached to his offense.” 41

156. The majority decision in Slater v. Olsen42 noted as follows:

“We do not approve of the statement in the case of Ex parte Garland… that the

effect of a full pardon is to make the offender ‘a new man’ that ‘in the eyes of the

law the offender is as innocent as if he never committed the offence’ because of

the broad implications that may be attributed to them. The statements have been

approved by some courts, but are strongly disapproved by many authorities.”

157. It is to be noted that even the dissenting judgment of Wennerstrum J., with whom

Bliss and Hale JJ. concurred, was in agreement with this element of the majority

judgment.

158. In R v. Cosgrove,43 Morris C.J. for the Supreme Court of Tasmania opined,

“Mr. Sholl contends that if a conspirator is pardoned he is in the position of one

who has never committed the crime and another person can no more be convicted

of having conspired with him than of having conspired with one who has been

acquitted or discharged. The gist of his contention is that a pardon wipes out the

crime ab initio. I have examined the passages in Hawkins Pleas of the Crown

to which he referred and I think they do not go as far as he contends. At

p.538 the learned author is really illustrating the fact that sometimes you may

have the offence of one so far dependent upon the offence of the other that one

falls with the other, and he instances the state of the law in England at the time

as to accessories. The authorities on libel and slander in my opinion do not

establish that a pardon wipes out the crime ab initio. They are based on a special

policy which the law has seen fit to adopt in relation to defamatory words.

Blackstone states the effect of a pardon in Vol. 4, p.402, as follows: '4, Lastly, the

effect of such pardon by the King, is to make the offender a new man; to acquit

him of all corporal penalties and forfeitures annexed to that offence for which he

obtains his pardon; and not so much to restore his former, as to give him a new,

credit and capacity.' That passage is entirely consistent with what Hawkins says.

Accordingly, a pardon is in no sense equivalent to an acquittal. It contains

no notion that the man to whom the pardon is extended never did in fact

43 (1948) Tas SR 99, at 106

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 68 of 306

commit the crime, but merely from the date of the pardon gives him a new credit

and capacity. The plea in my opinion is not sustained."44

159. Having considered the conflicting jurisprudence, Watkins L.J. of the English Court of

Appeal in R v. Barry Foster,45 agreeing with the positions in Tasmania and New

Zealand, as expounded respectively in R v. Cosgrove (supra)46 and Re Royal

Commission on Thomas’s Case,47 opined as follows:

“Many of the extracts we have been shown from textbooks and articles, some of

them written centuries ago, tend to support the proposition that a pardon leaves

the existence of a conviction untouched. These extracts include the works of

Bracton, Blackstone, Hawkins Pleas of the Crown 1824 and Holdsworth's History

of English Law. We have been referred also to a number of English cases.

In Prohibitions Del Roy ((1607) 12 Co.Rep. 63; 77 E.R. 1342) King James I was

firmly, if not severely, advised of his powers by the judges of the day. At p.65 and

p.1343 of the respective reports it is stated: "And the Judges informed the King,

that no king after the Conquest assumed to himself to give any judgment in any

cause whatsoever, which concerned the administration of justice within this

realm, but these were solely determined in the Courts of Justice." Statements to

the like effect appear in many of the works to which we have been referred. In

cases decided later on a contrary opinion seems to be expressed. For example, in

Hay v. Justices of the Tower Division of London (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 561, it was stated

that: "The King's pardon doth not only clear the offence itself, but all the

dependencies, penalties and disabilities incident unto it." Authority for that

proposition was claimed to arise from Cuddington v. Wilkins (1615) 1 Hob. 67

and 81 (80 E.R. at 216, 231). It is submitted, however, especially by Mr. Williams

[Counsel for the Appellant], that upon a full reading of both of those cases,

Cuddington's in particular, it is doubtful whether they really do support the

proposition that a conviction is done away with by a free pardon. We agree with

that.

…

We refer above all in this context to Cosgrove (1948) Tas.S.R. 99, in which

judgment was given by the Supreme Court of Tasmania. In that case a pardon

had been granted. It was a case which involved corruption. It was held that the

pardon granted was not the equivalent of an acquittal.

…

Finally, so far as quotation from authority is concerned, we refer to Re Royal

Commission on Thomas's Case [1980] 1 N.Z.L.R. 602. In 1979 Thomas was

granted a free pardon in respect of his conviction for the murders of David and

Jeanette Crewe. Later a Royal Commission was set up to inquire into and to report

on the circumstances of Thomas's conviction. The Commission began its work and

while it was sitting the New Zealand Police Association and others applied for a

judicial review of certain decisions of the Commission, for a writ of prohibition to

prevent the Commission from continuing to consider the matters referred to it

under the terms of reference, or an order declaring that the Commission be

disqualified from continuing to consider those matters. It is quite obvious from

the judgment in the case that much of the argument presented to the court by

counsel was devoted to the question of the impact of a free pardon upon

conviction. The High Court (Full Court) at Auckland held, among other things:

"The effect of the pardon was to remove the criminal element of the offence

named in the pardon, but not to create any factual fiction, or to raise the inference

that the person pardoned had not in fact committed the crime for which the

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 70 of 306

pardon was granted. Thomas, by reason of the pardon, was deemed to have been

wrongly convicted, and he could not again be charged with the murders of the

Crewes.” Many of the authorities shown to us were referred to in the judgment of

the Court….

We respectfully agree that the effect of a free pardon is as stated in the

judgments in the Tasmanian and New Zealand cases. In other words, the

effect of a free pardon is such as, in the words of the pardon itself, to remove

from the subject of the pardon, "all pains penalties and punishments

whatsoever that from the said conviction may ensue," but not to eliminate the

conviction itself. Mr. Arlidge suggests that a person pardoned rather than having

his conviction quashed may be under the practical disadvantage that if he is

called as a witness his conviction may be put to him; it could not be if it is quashed.

We express no opinion as to that. He has reminded us that constitutionally

the Crown no longer has a prerogative of justice, but only a prerogative of

mercy. It cannot, therefore, he submits, remove a conviction but only

pardon its effects. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) is the only body which

has statutory power to quash a conviction. With that we entirely agree.” 48

160. This view is endorsed by the US Courts of Appeal for the Third Circuit in United States

v. Gregory Paul Noonan.49 With specific reference to the dicta in R v. Barry Foster

(supra), It was concluded that:

“…on the basis of long-held traditional views on the effect of a pardon, covering

diverse periods and sources from Bracton and Blackstone to Professor Williston,

from seventeenth century English cases to those in contemporary courts of Great

Britain and the British Commonwealth, from 1915 teachings of the Supreme

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 71 of 306

Court, and the 1975 analysis of the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, we

conclude that the Presidential pardon of 1977 does not eliminate Noonan's

1968 conviction and does not "create any factual fiction" that Noonan's

conviction had not occurred to justify expunction of his criminal court record.

Poena tolli potest, culpa perennis erit (The punishment can be removed, but

the crime remains)” 50

161. Having considered authorities from Britain, the United States, Australia and New

Zealand, I now turn towards the jurisprudence emanating from India.

162. Maru Ram v. Union of India51 the Supreme Court of India opined that,

“… sentencing is judicial function and whatever may be done in the matter of

executing that sentence in the shape of remitting, commuting or otherwise

abbreviating, the Executive cannot alter the sentence itself. In Rabha's case

(1961) 2 SCR 133 at pp. 137, 138 : (AIR 1961 SC 334), a Constitution Bench of this

court illumined this branch of law. What is the jural consequence of a remission

of sentence?

In the first place, an order of remission does not wipe out the offence: it

also does not wipe out the conviction. All that it does is to have an effect

on the execution of the sentence; though ordinarily a convicted person would

have to serve out the full sentence imposed by a court, he need not do so with

respect to that part of the sentence which has been ordered to be remitted. An

order of re mission thus does not in any way interfere with the order of the court;

it affects only the execution of the sentence passed by the court and frees the

convicted person from his liability to undergo the full term of imprisonment

inflicted by the court, though the order of conviction and sentence passed by the

51 (1980) AIR 2147

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 72 of 306

court still stands as it was. The power to grant remission is executive power and

cannot have the effect which the order of an appellate or revisional court would

have of reducing the sentence passed by the trial court and substituting in its

place the reduced sentence adjudged by the appellate or revisional court. This

distinction is well brought out in the following passage from Weater's

"Constitutional law" on the effect of reprieves and pardons vis a vis the judgment

passed by the court imposing punishment, at p. 176, para 134: —

"A reprieve is a temporary suspension of the punishment fixed by law. A pardon

is the remission of such punishment. Both are the exercise of executive functions

and should be distinguished from the exercise of judicial power over sentences.

‘The judicial power and the power over sentences are readily distinguishable’,

observed justice Sutherland. To render a judgment is a judicial function. To carry

the judgment into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an

act of clemency is an exercise of executive power which abridges the enforcement

of the judgment but does not alter it qua judgment.”

Though, therefore, the effect of an order of remission is to wipe out that part of

the sentence of imprisonment which has not been served out and thus in practice

to reduce the sentence to the period already undergone, in law the order of

remission merely means that the rest of the sentence need not be undergone,

leaving the order of conviction by the court and the sentence passed by it

untouched.” 52

163. The 11A Respondent, in a self-defeating submission, to buttress his contention that

the power of pardon does not interfere with the judicial domain, cited the following

52 ibid at p. 2158, para 24 (Emphasis is mine)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 73 of 306

passage from Kehar Singh v. Union of India,53 in his written submissions dated 25th

August 2023:

“We are of the view that it is open to the President in the exercise of the power

vested in him by Art. 72 of the Constitution to scrutinize the evidence on the

record of the of the criminal case and come to a different conclusion from that

recorded by the court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence imposed on, the

accused. In doing so, the President does not amend or modify or supersede the

judicial record. The judicial record remains intact, and undisturbed. The President

acts in a wholly different plane from that in which the Court acted. He acts under

a constitutional power, the nature of which is entirely different from the judicial

power and cannot be regarded as an extension of it and this is so, notwithstanding

that the practical effect of the Presidential act is to remove the stigma of guilt

from the accused or to remit the sentence imposed on him.” 54

164. This passage, I must note, contradicts his own submission in regard to the effect of a

pardon. As I have noted earlier in the judgment, the 11A Respondent also contended

before this Court that it was not necessary to follow the constitutional procedure set

out in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution in granting the impugned 2nd

Pardon as the 2nd Respondent was, at that point in time, not an offender condemned

to suffer death by the sentence of any court. The gist of this contention is that the 1st

Pardon modified the judicial sentence to one of life imprisonment, and necessarily

wiped out the sentence of death. It is now palpably clear, by their own admission, that

this contention cannot stand.

165. In the more recent judgment of Epuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P,55 as noted by

Kapadia J.,

“Granting of pardon is in no sense an overturning of a judgment of conviction,

but rather it is an Executive action that mitigates or set aside the punishment for

a crime. It eliminates the effect of conviction without addressing defendant’s guilt

or innocence…”

Can a ‘Free Pardon’ Blot Out a Conviction?

166. There were several instances in the above discussion where the terms ‘free pardon’ or

‘full pardon’ appeared. The term ‘free pardon’ appears in the Constitution itself.

Whether there are any special jural consequences attached to what is known as a ‘free

pardon’ under our law is a question we must consider.

167. While most Counsel did not suggest free pardons as having an exceptional effect,

learned President's Counsel Mr. Saliya Pieris submitted ‘free pardons’ as being capable

of erasing the conviction itself. This position is supported by some of the old

authorities.

168. As to what a full pardon means, Durga Das Basu in Commentary on the

Constitution of India (3rd Ed)56 states,

“A full pardon wipes out the offence in the eye of law and rescinds the sentence

as well as the conviction. [Ex parte Garland, (1866) 4 Wall. 333.] It restores the

offender to that legal condition in which he would have been had the crime not

been committed. [Hay v. Justices of London, (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 561; Knote v. U.S.,

(1877) 95 U.S. 140.]”

169. The headnote of Sarat Chandra Rabha & Ors v. Khagendranath Nath & Ors,57

reads,

“…an order of remission of the sentence under S. 401 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, unlike the grant of a free pardon, cannot wipe out either the

conviction or the sentence. Such order is an executive order that merely affects

the execution of the sentence and does not stand on the same footing as an order

of Court, either in appeal or in revision, reducing the sentence passed by the Trial

Court”58

170. While I do agree with the views expressed in Sarath Chandra Rabha (supra) to the

extent it has been cited in Maru Ram (supra), I find myself unable to align with the

portion I have emphasized above. The power of pardon being a creature of ancient

origins, courts are understandably confronted with such anachronistic views. No

doubt if you travel back in time far enough, when absolute monarchs reigned with

brutish mandates, there would have been a time when a pardon—free pardon, full

pardon, remissions, commutation or whatever other form it might take—was able to

blot out guilt at the whim of a king and set a man free, for then, the king was one who

could do no wrong. The king was the fountain of justice, in whose name justice was

dispensed. Justice was his prerogative. If we are to set our jurisprudence that far back

and let ourselves be swayed by the vestiges of time immemorial, we may as well dust

off the old guillotines.

58 Emphasis is mine

171. More recent authorities have unequivocally rejected the age-old propositions, as can

be seen from the analysis set out above from the case of R v. Barry Foster (supra),

which has ever so eloquently analysed the jurisprudence from several jurisdictions.

The more recent Indian authorities, too, have moved away from this position.59

172. Article 89 of the Constitution is the only constitutional provision which makes

reference to a free pardon. It provides,

“No person shall be qualified to be an elector at an election of the President, or

of the Members of Parliament or to vote at any Referendum, if he is subject to

any of the following disqualifications, namely –

…

(d) if he is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately

preceding completed serving of a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever

name called) for a term not less than six months imposed after conviction

by any court for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not

less than two years or is under sentence of death or is serving or has during

the period of seven years immediately preceding completed the serving of

a sentence of imprisonment for a term not less than six months awarded

in lieu of execution of such sentence:

Provided that if any person disqualified under this paragraph is

granted a free pardon such disqualification shall cease from the date on

which the pardon is granted…”

173. Article 89 very clearly refers to the disqualifications arising in consequence of a

conviction, and not the conviction itself. Therefore, it is palpably clear that, as reflected

59 vide Arvind P. Datar, Commentary on the Constitution of India, Vol 1 (2nd edn, Wadhwa and Company Nagpur 2007) at 648; Mahendra P. Singh, V.N. Shukla’s Constitution of India, (8th edn, Eastern Book Company Lucknow 1990) at 265

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 77 of 306

in the language of our own Constitution, the term ‘free pardon’ does not contemplate

any special jural effect. If I may advert to the language of Article 34 once more, it

states that “[t]he President may… grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful

conditions…”. In this sense, a ‘free pardon’ or ‘full pardon’ in our constitutional scheme

means only a pardon which blots out all consequences of a sentence with no lawful

conditions attached thereto, and nothing more should be read into it. To hold

otherwise would be violative of Article 4 of the Constitution.

174. Article 4 provides,

“The Sovereignty of the People shall be exercised and enjoyed in the following

manner:–

(a) the legislative power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament,

consisting of elected representatives of the People and by the People at a

Referendum;

(b) the executive power of the People, including the defence of Sri Lanka,

shall be exercised by the President of the Republic elected by the

People;

(c) the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament

through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or

recognized, by the Constitution, or created and established by law, except

in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and

powers of Parliament and of its Members, wherein the judicial power

of the People may be exercised directly by Parliament according to

law…” 60

60 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 78 of 306

175. It is apparent that the President is vested with no amount of judicial power. The

language of Article 4 sets out, by the words “the judicial power of the People shall be

exercised by Parliament through courts”, that the judicial power is vested only with the

courts of law, subject to several exceptions where the parliament may exercise that

power. The phrase “by the Parliament through courts” is vulnerable to

misinterpretation, and is, in fact, misinterpreted more often than not. This phraseology

by no means establishes the Parliament as a supra-judicial authority, nor does it

conceive the Parliament as a conduit of judicial power; It is but a sentiment to the

instrumentality of legislation in the judicial process.

176. The people have entrusted their judicial power to the judiciary and nowhere else,

except in matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of the Parliament

and its members. I find the following authorities relevant to be considered in this

regard.

177. As noted in the English case of R v. Barry Foster (supra),61

“… [Crown Counsel] reminded us that constitutionally the Crown no longer has a

prerogative of justice, but only a prerogative of mercy. It cannot, therefore, he

submits, remove a conviction but only pardons its effects. The Court of Appeal

(Criminal Division) is the only body which has statutory power to quash a

conviction. With that we entirely agree.”

178. Citing the above case, United States v. Gregory Paul Noonan (supra)62 stated that,

“Likewise, in the context of our tradition, our law, and our constitutional

doctrine—be it state or federal—the executive branch has never possessed “a

61 [1985] 1 QB 115 at 130

62 906 F.2d 952 (3d Cir. 1990)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 79 of 306

prerogative of justice”. That has always been the exclusive province of the

Third Branch of government, the judiciary.” 63

“Whatever be the effect of a Presidential pardon in other respects, as we shall

volunteer below, the notion that the President has the ability, through the pardon

power vested under Article II, Sec. 2, to tamper with judicial records is a concept

jurisprudentially difficult to swallow. The idea flies in the face of the separation of

powers doctrine. We need only to note that Article III, Sec. 1 states: ‘The judicial

power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such

inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.’ It is

beyond cavil that the maintenance of court records is an inherent aspect of

judicial power.”64

179. The President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is not vested with a

‘prerogative of justice’. He or she is but the custodian of executive power, which

ultimately belongs to the People of the Republic. The President cannot, in the exercise

of the power of pardon, usurp the judicial power of the people, which is exclusively

vested in the judiciary, except in such limited circumstances where it is expressly

vested with the Parliament.

Conclusion of the Court Regarding the Effects of a Pardon

180. In examining existing authorities, especially those from the United States and Britain,

we were first confronted with the phenomenon that there is a wide array of conflicting

views. However, it was further revealed how contemporary courts, across the many

jurisdictions we examined, have come to a consensus as to this question.

63 ibid at 26 (Emphasis is mine)

64 ibid at 33

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 80 of 306

181. It is now unquestionable that a pardon leaves the conviction untouched. It is purely

an executive act which is, by its very nature, incapable of changing the judicial record

or encroaching upon the judicial province. An act of pardon, reprieve, respite,

remission or commutation—or whatever other manifestation of this power under

Article 34—leaves the judicial record, ergo the conviction, untouched and unscathed.

It does not create any factual fiction that a crime had never been committed or the

grantee had never been convicted.

182. A party is acquitted on the ground of his innocence; he is pardoned through public

favour, for the good of the Republic. It is upon this very ground that the power of

pardon is never vested in a judge.65 Insofar as the power of pardon is concerned,

poena tolli potest, culpa perennis erit [The punishment can be annulled, the sin will be

perpetual].

183. As such, the effects of ‘reprieve’, ‘respite’, ‘remission’, ‘commutation’ and ‘pardon’ can

be summarized thus:

Reprieve or Respite: A reprieve, i.e., a temporary suspension of the punishment

fixed by law, and a respite, i.e., a postponement to the future the execution of

a sentence, means, in essence, to stay the execution of a sentence or the

enforcement of a penalty,66 which offers a brief interval of rest or relief. E.g., a

reprieve or respite may be granted to a pregnant prisoner till childbirth.67 They

66 Mahendra P. Singh, V.N. Shukla’s Constitution of India, (8th edn, Eastern Book Company Lucknow 1990) at 385. Per Blackstone, “[a] REPRIEVE, from reprendre, to take back, is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of time; whereby the execution is suspended…”: Wilfrid Prest, The Oxford Edition of Blackstone: Commentaries on the Laws of England – Book IV of Public Wrongs (Oxford University Press 2016) at p. 255, para 387

67 As Blackstone notes, “REPRIEVES may also be ex necessitate legis [from legal necessity]: as, where a woman is capitally convicted, and pleads her pregnancy; though this is no cause to stay the judgment, yet it is to respite the execution till she be delivered. This is a mercy dictated by the law of nature, in favorem prolis [in favour of the offspring]; and therefore no part of the bloody

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 81 of 306

are often used interchangeably, and I see no distinction in principle, insofar as

their effects.

Remission: A remission reduces the term of the sentence without changing its

character. E.g., a sentence of 5 years simple imprisonment may be remitted to

a sentence of 2 years simple imprisonment or a ten thousand rupees fine to one

of two thousand rupees.

Commutation: A commutation is the conversion to a lighter penalty of a

different form. It changes the punishment to one of a different character than

that originally imposed. This power can only be exercised to reduce and not to

enhance the sentence.68 E.g., a death sentence to one of life imprisonment.

Pardon: The term ‘pardon’ is often used as an umbrella term for all of the

aforementioned. It released the convict from the punishment, or part thereof,

for some offence, without touching the sentence or the conviction itself. It is a

full or free pardon to which no conditions are attached and the convict is

released from the entirety of the punishment. A limited pardon relieves the

offender from some but not all the consequences of the conviction. A

proceedings, in the reign of queen Mary, hath been more justly detested than the cruelty, that was exercised in the island of Guernsey, of burning a woman big with child: and, when through the violence of the flames the infant sprang forth at the stake, and was preserved by the bystanders, after some deliberation of the priests who assisted the sacrifice, they cast it again into the fire [The reference is to the ‘Guernsey Martyrs’, Catherine Cauchés and her daughters Guillemine and Perotine, condemned to death as heretics in July 1556. According to Foxe, it was the bailiff of Guernsey who ordered Perotine’s child to be thrown back into the fire] as a young heretic [2 Hal. P. C. 412.]. A barbarity which they never learned from the laws of antient Rome; which direct [Ff. 48. 19. 3.], with the same humanity as our own, “quod praegnantis Mulieris damnatae poena differatur, quoad pariat [that the punishment of a pregnant woman condemned, shall be respited until after her delivery]:” which doctrine has also prevailed in England, as early as the first memorials of our law will reach [Flet. l. 1. c. 38.]: Wilfrid Prest, The Oxford Edition of Blackstone: Commentaries on the Laws of England – Book IV of Public Wrongs (Oxford University Press 2016) at p. 255, para 388

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 82 of 306

conditional pardon imposes some condition, such as good behaviour, for the

pardon to remain effective.

184. Following this arduous analysis of authorities, we may now prudently answer the first

question I laid down aeons back, as to whether or not the constitutional procedure

must be followed anew in granting the impugned 2nd Pardon to the 2nd Respondent.

The answer must most certainly be in the affirmative. Despite the 1st Pardon

commuting the sentence of death to one of life imprisonment—presuming the same

is legally valid for the moment—the 2nd Respondent to this date remains an offender

condemned to suffer death by the sentence of a court.

185. If a dozen pardons, remissions or respites, as the case may be, are to be granted to a

convict sentenced to death at any point in time, the procedure must be followed de

novo in granting each of such pardons.

POWER OF PARDON: SCOPE, PURPOSE AND UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY

186. The nature of this power and the purpose for which it exists is a question all learned

Counsel attempted to answer. In my view, effectively answering this question is

imperative before we venture into the question with regards to the extent of its

amenability to judicial review, for it would be otiose to deliberate on the justiciability

of a power that is ill-defined and obscure. This question, which comes before us for

the first time, has been the subject of many judicial and academic discussions in other

jurisdictions, as with most other aspects of the power of pardon, and some, but not

all, such authorities resonate well with our own jurisprudence.

187. As was noted in Ex parte Bentley (supra) the prerogative of mercy in the United

Kingdom is “capable of being exercised in many different circumstances and over a wide

range’.69 Justice Basten of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Cameron

69 [1994] QB 349, at 363 (Watkins L.J. for the Court)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 83 of 306

v. The Queen70 recognized old age, illness and decrepitude as actors that may be

relevant to the executive power of early release based on mercy.

188. Per Halsbury’s Laws of England (5th Ed),

“The occasion for clemency might be, for example: medical grounds; fresh

evidence indicating a wrongful conviction revealed too late or unavailable for

consideration by the court of trial but insufficiently conclusive to justify a pardon;

to mitigate the consequences of some irregularity at a summary trial; to

compensate a prisoner for physical injury suffered in prison through no fault of

his own; as a reward for supplying valuable information to the authorities

investigating serious crime; or for exceptionally meritorious conduct by the

prisoner during his imprisonment” 71

189. In a classic exposition in regard to the purpose of Executive Clemency, in Ex parte

Philip Grossman,72 Taft C.J. of the Supreme Court of the United States expounded,

"Executive clemency exists to afford relief from under harshness or evident

mistake in the operation or the enforcement of the criminal law. The

administration of justice by the courts is not necessarily always wise or certainly

considerate of circumstances which may properly mitigate guilt. To afford a

remedy, it has always been thought essential in popular governments, as well as

in monarchies, to vest in some other authority than the courts power to

ameliorate or avoid particular criminal judgments.”

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 84 of 306

190. According to the Supreme Court of the United States stated in Ex parte William

Wells,73 this power is to be exercised ”particularly when the circumstances of any case

disclosed such uncertainties as made it doubtful it there should have been a conviction

of the criminal, or when they are such as to show that there might be a mitigation of

the punishment without lessening the obligation of vindicatory justice.”

191. Among this myriad of reasons, there may also be purely political and practical

considerations. Alexander Hamilton’s The Federalist No. 74 in 1788, explaining why

the Founding Fathers vested with the President of the United States such wide

discretionary power, states,

“… But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to

the Chief Magistrate [Chief Administrator] is this: in seasons of insurrection or

rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to

the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and

which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to

recall.”

192. Corpus Juris Secundum (Vol. 67-A) reads,

"The pardoning power is founded on considerations of the public good, and

is to be exercised on the ground that the public welfare, which is the

legitimate object of all punishment, will be as well promoted by a

suspension as by an execution of the sentence. It may also be used to the end

that justice be done by correcting injustice, as where after-discovered facts

convince the official or board invested with the power that there was no guilt or

that other mistakes were made in the operation or enforcement of the criminal

73 15 L. Ed. 421; 59 U.S. 307 (1855) at 59

law. Executive clemency also exists to afford relief from undue harshness in the

operation or enforcement of criminal law." 74

193. Supreme Court of India, in Epuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P. (supra),75 further cited

the following passage from ‘American Jurisprudence’ explaining the underlying

philosophy of the pardon power:

“…every civilized country recognizes, and has therefore provided for, the

pardoning power to be exercised as an act of grace and humanity in proper cases.

Without such a power of clemency, to be exercised by some department or

functionary of a government, a country would be most imperfect and deficient in

its political morality, and in that attribute of Deity whose judgments are always

tempered with mercy.” 76

194. In Maru Ram v. Union of India (supra),77 the Supreme Court of India stated that,

“Considerations for exercise of power under Articles 72/161 [Articles which deal

with Presidential Pardon in India] may be myriad and their occasions protean,

and are left to the appropriate Government, by no consideration nor occasion can

be wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory or mala fide. Only in these rare

cases will the court examine the exercise.” 78

195. Moreover, in Kehar Singh v. Union of India (supra)79 the following was observed

with regard to the purpose of presidential pardoning power:

“… the fallibility of human judgment being undeniable even in the most trained

mind, a mind resourced by a harvest of experience, it has been considered

appropriate that in the matter of life and personal liberty, the protection should

be extended by entrusting power further to some high authority to scrutinise the

validity of the threatened denial of life or the threatened or continued denial of

personal liberty…”

196. Their Lordships further observed, with regard to the nature of this power, that,

“… The power so entrusted is a power belonging to the people and reposed

in the highest dignitary of the State. In England, the power is regarded as the

royal prerogative of pardon exercised by the Sovereign, generally through the

Home Secretary. It is a power which is capable of exercise on a variety of

grounds, for reasons of State as well as the desire to safeguard against

judicial error. It is an act of grace issuing from the Sovereign. In the United

States, however, after the founding of the Republic, a pardon by the

President has been regarded not as a private act of grace but as a part of

the constitutional scheme. In an opinion, remarkable for its erudition and

clarity, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in W.I. Biddle v. Vuco Perovich,

71 L. Ed. 1161 enunciated this view and it has since been, affirmed in other

decisions.” 80

197. It is to be noted that this observation in Kehar Singh—as with many authorities cited

above—does not take cognizance of some of the more vital recent developments in

English law noted earlier in this judgment, as it was decided over three decades ago.

80 ibid (Emphasis is mine)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 87 of 306

The United Kingdom has now enacted special legislation as a safeguard against

judicial error and miscarriages of justice, which, in my view, is indicative of a paradigm

shift in the attitude towards the exercise of the prerogative of mercy.

198. Therefore, we must be exceptionally mindful in seeking guidance from such older

authorities, as persuasive as they are, for it is imperative that we construe our

constitutional provisions in light of the constitutional norms of our time, which is what

the Rule of Law demands of this Court.

199. Despite this, it is clear that Indian jurisprudence, in consonance with the judgment of

Justice Holmes, has consistently recognized the power of pardon as part of the

constitutional scheme to be exercised in a manner which would better serve public

welfare, which emerges as the contemporary norm in all jurisdictions we have

examined in the judgment. This most certainly is the fitting approach for any republic,

including our own.

Nature and Scope of Presidential Pardon under Article 34 of the Constitution of

Sri Lanka

200. It is pertinent to reiterate the celebrated judgment of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes

Jr., in Biddle v. Perovich (supra),81 which I unequivocally endorse vis-à-vis our own

constitutional framework:

“…A pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual

happening to possess power. It is part of the Constitutional scheme. When

granted, it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public

welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed…”82

201. It was revealed to us that, in other jurisdictions, there have been instances where

pardons were granted to persons before conviction, or, at times, even before they

were charged with an offence. President Gerald Ford’s pardon of President Nixon

following Watergate stands a prominent example.

202. However, the power entrusted to the President of Sri Lanka under Article 34 of the

Constitution cannot be used in this manner. Article 34 contemplates “any offender

convicted of any offence, whereas Sections 311 and 312 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 contemplates a person “sentenced to punishment for

an offence” and a “person sentenced”, respectively. In this sense, the power must be

distinguished from the power of the Attorney-General to enter into a nolle prosequi

under Section 194 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. The power

under Section 194(1) is one which can only be exercised by the Attorney-General

himself (vide Section 401 of the Code).

203. Although much of the authorities clearly set out the power of pardon to be an

executive power, the learned Additional Solicitor General made a rather unique

contention in which he argued the power to be of a sui generis nature, for it did not

fit easily into the legislative, executive or judicial spheres of government. This

submission is one which bears upon the reviewability of the power. Despite this

Court’s earlier conclusion to the effect that this power is of executive nature, so as to

test the veracity of the said conclusion, I shall mull over the learned Additional Solicitor

General’s submission separately where I consider judicial reviewability.

204. The 11A Respondent, however, conceded the power of pardon to be a purely

executive power which does not undermine the judicial power over sentencing. He

submitted, relying on Kehar Singh v. Union of India (supra) and United States v.

Benz (supra), that the power of pardon only abridges the executive function of

enforcing a judgment without altering the judgment itself, as it operates in an entirely

different plane to that of judicial power. With this submission, I agree in its entirety.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 89 of 306

Having said that, I cannot rule out an extraordinarily abhorrent and bizarre act in a

purported exercise of this power from potentially interfering with the functions of the

judiciary under appropriately deplorable circumstances. Apart from such instances of

absolute misrule, the exercise of the power of pardon ordinarily does not interfere

with the judicial function, even where such exercise has been simply and plainly

imprudent and/or ultra vires.

205. It was also contended on behalf of the 11A Respondent that “the President of the

Republic could exercise his discretion freely in granting a pardon to a person who has

not been sentenced to a death penalty”.83 It was then alleged that the Petitioner was

“seeking to derogate the power vested in the office of the President of the Republic by

the present Application”.84

206. The Petitioner’s submission was that the President is not vested with unfettered

discretion in any regard under the Constitution, for such discretion is anathema to

established constitutional and administrative law principles. This submission is, of

course, an axiom. Any suggestion to the contrary, in the words of Wade and Forsyth,

is constitutional blasphemy.85

207. Quite apart from the days of the Kings, Queen and Emperors with real power over

their subjects, the constitutionally established democratic systems of today are

invariably predicated upon the immutable republican principles of constitutional

governance. On top of the express limitations imposed by the Constitution itself and

other provisions of the law, the scope of this power under Article 34 is necessarily

limited by such principles. The black letter of the law may not say the same in so many

words, but a constitution is never to be interpreted devoid of the very principles

underlying it. The principles so infused to the text are indissoluble from it; for

otherwise, the constitution is without constitutionalism. Chief among the most

fundamental canons of constitutionalism is the Rule of Law, which has often been

described as the bedrock upon which our Constitution is grounded.

208. Moreover, as Justice Holmes rightfully propounded regarding the power of pardon,

the manner of its exercise must be such that it better serves public welfare. Much of

the jurisprudence I have already set out amply illustrates the proclivity to recognize

this power as one that must be exercised in the public interest. This was so even in

constitutional monarchies. This position essentially predicates the Public Trust

Doctrine, which is well-established in our constitutional jurisprudence as one of the

great bulwarks of popular sovereignty.

209. As Immanuel Kant writes, as far back as in the 18th century, with reference to the

sovereign ‘right’ to pardon a criminal;

“The right to pardon a criminal (ius aggratiandi), either by mitigating or by

entirely remitting the punishment, is certainly the most slippery of all the rights

of the sovereign. By exercising it he can demonstrate the splendor of his majesty

and yet thereby wreak injustice to a high degree. With respect to a crime of one

subject against another, he absolutely cannot exercise this right, for in such

cases exemption from punishment (impunitas criminis) constitutes the

greatest injustice toward his subjects. Consequently, he can make use of this

right of pardon only in connection with an injury committed against himself

(crimen laesae majestatis). But, even in these cases, he cannot allow a crime to

go unpunished if the safety of the people might be endangered thereby.” 86

210. Per G. S. Singhvi J., in Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v. State of N.C.T of Delhi,87

“…the power vested in the President under Article 72 and the Governor

under Article 161 of the Constitution is manifestation of prerogative of the State.

It is neither a matter of grace nor a matter of privilege, but is an important

constitutional responsibility to be discharged by the highest executive keeping in

view the considerations of larger public interest and welfare of the people.” 88

211. It is clear that the power of pardon, in its variety of forms, has been long recognized

as power which must serve the best interest of the people. This line of thinking is well

grounded in our Constitutional jurisprudence, albeit not specifically with regards to

the power of pardon for the common law on that front has only just begun to develop.

212. In one of the better expositions of the Public Trust Doctrine, Shiranee Tilakawardane

J., in Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika Kumaratunga (Waters Edge Case),89

opined,

“The principle that those charged with upholding the Constitution—be it a police

officer of the lowest rank or the President—are to do so in a way that does not

“violate the Doctrine of Public Trust” by state action/inaction is a basic tenet of

the Constitution which upholds the legitimacy of Government and the

Sovereignty of the People… Public power is not for personal gain or favour, but

always to be used to optimize the benefit of the People.” 90

213. This cardinal Doctrine of Public Trust, which is well established in our law as protector

of the Rule of Law itself, extends as it is to any and all such power vested in public

authorities by law.91 To conceive the power of pardon under Article 34 as an exception

to this general principle would be manifestly illogical, given the Constitution itself

does nothing to so set it apart.

214. No creature under the Constitution has unlimited or unfettered power. In the words

of Sripavan C.J., In Re the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution,92 “[c]learly

the Constitution did not intend the President to function as an unfettered repository of

executive power unconstrained by the other organs of governance”.

215. There is no power capable of being exercised freely by the President, or by any other

servant of the public for that matter, for they are constantly weighed down by the

trust reposed upon them. The sovereign will of the people, as manifested by the

Constitution, recognizes this very burden under Article 4(d). It is the pardoning power

of the people that has been entrusted upon the President by the Constitution—Like

all other executive power, it, too, must necessarily be exercised for the benefit of the

people.93 If ever there was an executive who could do all but ‘turn a man into a woman

and a woman into a man’, those days are long gone.

91 As can be understood from the many seminal decisions which has recognised the principle as such. Vide De Silva v. Atukorale (1993) 1 Sri LR 283; Bandara v. Premachandra (1994) 1 Sri LR 301; Premachandra v. Montague Jayawickrama (1994) 2 Sri LR 90; Jayawardene v. Wijayatilake (2001) 1 Sri LR 132; Vasudeva Nanayakkara v.

Purpose and Underlying Philosophy of Presidential Pardon Under Article 34 of

the Constitution of Sri Lanka

216. Mr. Saliya Peiris, PC was of the opinion that this power must be conceived as a means

of empowering the President to remedy any proven miscarriages of justice, as there

exists no procedure to correct such errors in our law; and that many of the

aforementioned authorities recognized the power as such. The learned Additional

Solicitor General, too, agreed with this view, submitting further that this power exists

as a means of providing a check on judicial power. I find myself unable to align entirely

with either of these perspectives, for modern norms appear to be at odds with the

same.

217. I wish to first consider the latter contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General,

in regard to this power being part of the checks and balances scheme, as the former

warrants a more thorough discussion.

218. In my view, the proposition that this power is part of the checks and balances scheme

within our Constitution is wholly untenable. The said proposition necessarily hinges

on an assertion that this power exists for the sole purpose of redressing—in the sense

of correcting or rectifying and not merely providing relief against—judicial errors and

miscarriages of justice. If there are multiple purposes, some of which do not concern

themselves with the merits of the judicial pronouncements, it can no longer be

maintained.

219. As already observed, among the myriad of reasons which may warrant the exercise of

pardoning power, many jurisdictions recognize, not only moral and legal

considerations but also purely political considerations as legitimate. Presidential

pardons are often granted to mark Independence Day celebrations and other

President as a matter of convenience, I use all such term to mean what I have described here and must be read as such unless context requires otherwise.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 94 of 306

culturally significant events. Over 1,500 prisoners were granted such pardons by the

incumbent President, marking Independence Day and Vesak celebrations in 2023.

Other prisoners, such as foreign nationals, are at times pardoned in the national

interest as a matter of international policy—I shall keep any precise references to

myself in the interest of not passing any prejudicial comments. Such cases in no way

involve miscarriages of justice or judicial errors.

220. These examples resting on the aforementioned authorities demonstrate categorically

that this power exists not solely as a means of redressing proven miscarriages of

justice, but also to serve a myriad of other motives. Moreover, this power concerns

itself only with those convicted of criminal offences. If this is indeed part of the checks

and balances scheme within our Constitution, it would only be a check on the criminal

jurisdiction of the courts. As such, neither the provision itself nor its historical usage

point towards it solely being a check of judicial power.

221. While it is so glaringly apparent that this power cannot be conceived as one in

existence as a check on judicial power for the sole purpose of redressing proven

miscarriages of justice, could this function of redressing proven miscarriages of justice

and judicial errors be one of its many functions? In all fairness, this was, in fact, the

precise nature of the submission made by the learned Additional Solicitor General.

This is a question which demands a more careful and nuanced contemplation.

222. In this regard, this Court is in full agreement with Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC appearing

for the 9th and 10th Respondents, in his view that there is no competent body, save

and except such courts with appellate and revisionary jurisdiction, within our

constitutional scheme to redress possible miscarriages of justice.

223. Altering or setting aside a conviction or a sentence is a function which falls exclusively

within the judicial domain. Yet, the pardoning power of the people may well be used,

based on reasonable grounds, to offer some redress to a person convicted of a crime

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 95 of 306

insofar as the execution of the sentence is concerned; such is the precise effect of a

pardon. To put in much simpler terms, this power may grant some redress, in that it

can offer some form of reparation or relief against the harshness of justice, but it may

not correct, rectify, amend or alter a conviction or a judicial record. There is a sharp

distinction between the two effects, as was discussed earlier, for those functions

operate on two distinct and separate planes.

224. In the words of Sutherland J. in United States v. Benz,94

“The judicial power and the executive power over sentence are readily

distinguishable. To render judgment is a judicial function. To carry the judgment

into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an act of clemency

is an exercise of executive power which abridges the enforcement of the judgment,

but does not alter it qua a judgment. To reduce a sentence by amendment alters

the terms of the judgment itself and is a judicial act as much as the imposition of

the sentence in the first instance.”

225. What the President has been empowered to do under Article 34 of the Constitution

is to look into the merits of the execution or the continuation of a sentence which has

been passed—not the merits of the judicial decision which predicated such sentence.

The inquiry by the President in the exercise of the power of pardon must not be

tantamount to subjecting a convict to a retrial.

226. Admittedly, much older authorities in great numbers can be cited in support of the

contention set forth by the learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Saliya Pieris,

PC who urged this power to be conceived as one which may correct miscarriages of

justice for lack of better procedure to achieve the same end. As anachronistic as this

view may be, I must admit that it is susceptible to some reason when considered in

94 75 L. Ed. 354; 282 U.S. 304; 51 S.Ct. 113 at para 16

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 96 of 306

the correct context—yet, I do not think it finds any sympathy within our constitutional

scheme.

227. Prof. Samuel Williston proposes this line of reasoning as a probable reason as to

why some courts showed a continued willingness to accept the Garland rationale.95

He reasons thus:

“A probable reason why courts have been willing to continue a mode of expression

which suggests that a pardoned convict is the equal in character and conduct of an

innocent man is because it has seemed desirable to conceal an injustice which the

criminal law inflicts upon an innocent man unjustly accused and convicted. Under

the law of England no new trial was possible in case of felony. [Regina v. Murphy, L.R.

2 P. C. 535 (1869)] The only redress, therefore, for an unjust conviction was a pardon.

Of this procedure an acute English critic (afterwards a judge) said:

"However unsatisfactory such a verdict may be; whatever facts may be discovered

after the trial, which if known at the trial would have altered the result, no means

are at present provided by law by which a verdict can be reversed. All that can be

done in such a case is to apply to the Queen through the Secretary of State for

the Home Department for a pardon for the person supposed to have been wrongly

convicted.

This is one of the greatest defects in our whole system of criminal procedure. To

pardon a man on the ground of his innocence is in it-self, to say the least, an

exceedingly clumsy mode of procedure; but not to insist upon this, it cannot be

denied that the system places everyone concerned, and especially the Home

Secretary and the judge who tried the case (who in practice is always consulted),

in a position at once painful and radically wrong, because they are called upon

95 vide supra the reasoning as to the effect of a pardon in Ex parte Garland 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1866)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 97 of 306

to exercise what really are the highest judicial functions without any of the

conditions essential to the due discharge of such functions. They cannot take

evidence, they cannot hear arguments, they act in the dark, and cannot explain

the reasons of the decision at which they arrive. The evil is notorious.” [STEPHEN,

HISTORY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW, p. 312.]

This defect in English procedure was corrected by the Act of I907 creating a court of

criminal appeal, with the widest powers, including the right to hear further evidence

and decide questions of fact.” 96

228. As we were repeatedly told by the learned President's Counsel, it is true that there is

no formal procedure to challenge a judicial decision after a refusal of special leave by

the Supreme Court. I do not, however, see this only as a defect, for there must be

some finality in judicial procedure. Where new facts have come to light subsequent

to the total exhaustion of the appeal procedure, a prisoner may find solace in the

doctrine of per incuriam.

229. The new approach in Australia, UK and New Zealand, which provides for review

committees to refer cases back to the appellate court, appears a much wiser solution

to this defect highlighted by the learned Counsel. However desirable that may be, it

is not for this Court to establish such regimes; and for the power of pardon to

interpose into this lacuna in our law would be clearly obnoxious to Article 4 of the

Constitution.

230. As we have clearly seen earlier in the judgment, the pardoning power of the people

as exercised by the President is one which operates in the executive plane,97 and has

96 Williston, ‘Does a Pardon Blot Out Guilt?’ (1915) Vol. 28 No. 7 Harvard Law Review 647, at 659

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 98 of 306

no bearing on the judicial record. The power to correct a wrongful conviction lies with

the judiciary and the judiciary alone.

231. Therefore, if such an executive function were to set right a wrongful conviction and

correct a miscarriage of justice, that would be inconsistent with not only Article 4, but

also the findings of this very Court with regards to the effect of pardon earlier in this

judgment. Considering the above, I do not see the power of pardon under Article 34

of the Constitution as a measure capable of correcting miscarriages of justice.

232. Any authorities which may support the proposition that the prerogative of mercy,

power of pardon, executive clemency, or any other manifestation of this power, as

being capable of correcting a wrongful conviction are from a time long gone and are

not persuasive against contemporary constitutional norms. As such, in my view,

among the myriad of ends this power may achieve, correcting miscarriages of justice

or wrongful convictions is not one.

233. As regards the purposes for which the power may be invoked, to lay out an exhaustive

list would be a bootless errand. It may be used for any purpose which serves the public

interest, such as social reconstruction and rehabilitation, as objectives of punishment

attain overriding importance in a Welfare State. The utmost object of punishment is

the protection of society, through the removal of offenders from it or through

rehabilitation, in this era of human rights.

234. Remission of sentences for good behaviour as provided by the Prisons Ordinance or

any other law would, in this sense, be in the public interest where such scheme

legitimately comes to fruition. Consideration may also be political; in that, they may

strengthen international relations or resolve long-standing social issues. It may even

be an act of grace—not a private act of grace, but a public one, for is the pardoning

power of the people that is vested in the President.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 99 of 306

235. Pardons may further be issued to better reflect changing moral attitudes towards what

is deemed criminal or illegal, as with the posthumous pardon of Dr. Alan Turing,

known as the father of modern computer science, who was convicted of gross

indecency based on a homosexual relationship and committed suicide following

chemical castration treatment. This pardon undoubtedly stands as a sentiment to the

contemporary moral and political attitude towards homosexuality in Britain, an end

which no court of law would be so effective in achieving.

236. In conclusion, though there are a myriad of grounds upon which the power of pardon

may be exercised, such exercise should be in the public interest and must necessarily

conform to the finer canons of constitutionalism. Moreover, the power so enshrined

under Article 34 does not operate as a check on the judiciary and cannot be used to

correct miscarriages of justice, for any encroachment of the judicial province by the

President is blatantly offensive to the scheme of the Constitution. The power of

pardon, as I have persistently stressed, is to be exercised in the best interest of the

populace. It is a tool which must serve the public—not the gifted demagogues.

JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ITS SCOPE

237. The law in this regard may be thought settled to a certain degree in light of the recent

judgment of Surasena J. in Hirunika Premachandra v. Attorney-General and

Others (Duminda Silva Pardon),98 whereby the pardon granted to former

parliamentarian Duminda Silva by the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was held

to be null, void and of no force or avail in law by this Court. While the general

reviewability of the actions of a President has been analysed vis-à-vis the immunities

afforded to the Executive Presidency by the Constitution,99 the many nuances

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 100 of 306

associated with the reviewability of certain aspects of pardoning power have not come

into question therein.

238. The case before us is one significantly less straightforward. In light of this, the Counsel

have been rather inventive and resourceful in their submissions. I do not see it fit to

dispense the question of reviewability without duly appreciating the same.

239. The learned Additional Solicitor General, relying on the judgments of Attorney-

General v. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake100 and Thenuwara v. Chamal Rajapaksa,

Speaker of Parliament,101 submitted the power of pardon vested in the President

under Article 34 of the Constitution to be what he called a ‘sui generis power’.

240. Seeing as this Court has already accepted the power of pardon to be an entirely

executive function, this submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General in

regard to the power of pardon being a sui generis power, which does not fit easily

into legislative, executive or judicial spheres, must fail a fortiori. Nonetheless, owing

to the ingenuity of this submission, I shall consider the same so as to test the veracity

of my earlier conclusion.

241. Article 4(b) of the Constitution provides that “the executive power of the People,

including the defence of Sri Lanka, shall be exercised by the President of the Republic

elected by the People”. According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, while the

executive power is vested with the President, it does not mean that the exercise of

Dissanayake (1999) 1 Sri LR 157; Victor Ivan and others v. Sarath N. Silva and others (2001) 1 Sri LR 309; Singarasa v. Attorney-General (2013) 1 Sri LR 245; Rajavarothiam Sampanthan v. Attorney-General SC FR 351-356/2018, SC FR 358- 361/2018, SC Minutes of 13 December 2018

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 101 of 306

any and all powers vested in the President constitutes executive and administrative

action.

242. The submission made by the learned Additional Solicitor General essentially

attempted to classify the power of pardon as a sui generis power, and claimed such

sui generis powers to have certain distinguishable characteristics, such as the fact that

they cannot easily be classified under Article 4 and that they require concurrence from

more than one organ of government. Indeed, the cases he relied upon recognized the

power of impeachment of judges under Article 107 of the Constitution as such a sui

generis power, but the extent to which those judgments lend themselves to the

position taken by the learned Additional Solicitor General is questionable.

243. He further submitted sui generis powers to be beyond the scope of judicial review, for

such power does not fit in the moulds of executive or administrative action as

contemplated by Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution.

244. In Attorney-General v. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake (supra),102 a five-judge bench

of this Court stated as follows:

“In my view none of these powers are exclusively powers of Parliament or the

exclusive province of any other governmental organ, as all those provisions

adverted to by the learned Attorney General seek to create mechanisms which

are unique and are sui generis in the sense that they are the only mode of removal

of the incumbents of those offices known to the Constitution. The power of

removal of the President of Sri Lanka, the Chief Justice and other Judges of the

Supreme Court, the President and other Judges of the Court of Appeal and the

Commissioner General of Elections in terms of the aforesaid provisions of the

Constitution, have to be exercised by one organ of State in concurrence with one

102 S.C. Appeal No. 67/2013, SC Minutes of 21 February 2014 at 19-20

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 102 of 306

or more governmental organ or organs, and this feature constitutes a system of

checks and balances which is essential for the preservation of the Rule of Law.”

245. In Thenuwara v. Chamal Rajapaksa, Speaker of Parliament,103 it was opined that,

“This was an integral part of a sui generis function of Parliament which did not

fit easily into the legislative, executive or judicial spheres of government and bore

a unique complexion in that, while being more disciplinary in nature, it could not

be exercised by Parliament alone and had to be performed in concurrence with

the President of Sri Lanka, as contemplated by Article 107(2) and (3) of the

Constitution. It is for this reason that the power of impeachment does not find

express reference in Article 4(a) of the Constitution that deals with the legislative

power of the People vested exclusively in Parliament and the People at a

Referendum, or in either Article 4(b) that vests the executive power of the People

exclusively on the President or Article 4(c) that vests the judicial power of the

People in Parliament to be carried out by the courts and other tribunals or

institutions administering justice, “except in regard to matters relating to the

privileges, immunities “and powers of Parliament and of its Members, wherein the

judicial power of the People may be exercised directly by Parliament according to

law.”

246. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted it to be evident from the

abovementioned dicta, that “…sui generis powers have certain characteristics, being

that they cannot easily be classified under Article 4 and that they involve concurrence

with another organ of government…”.104

247. It was his position that the power or pardon is one exercised by the President in

concurrence with the judiciary, as Article 34 requires the President to obtain a report

from the trial judge. I do not see any merit in this position. The trial judge plays no

part in the decision by merely producing a report. Collaborations of this nature

between two organs of the State do not amount to concurrence as contemplated in

the aforementioned dicta. Such engagements are commonplace in routine workings

of the State; for if not, the State apparatus would come to a standstill, or a

constitutional deadlock, as it is often called. In this sense, if Ministers were to

participate in the legislative process does that make such process sui generis? Are the

proceedings before a Magistrate following a B-Report sui generis? Is the function of

this Court in delivering this judgment sui generis, seeing as we have procured two files

from the Presidential Secretariat? As evident, this proposition manifests absurdities.

248. Furthermore, the aforementioned dicta, have in no way established a category or class

of power called ‘sui generis’ that is ipso facto beyond the scope of juridical review. Nor

can the views expressed therein be taken to constitute criterion to identify what may

be termed sui generis. In fact, no such test, definition or criterion of what constitutes

sui generis can exist. Sui generis means to be ‘unique’, ‘a thing of its own kind’ with

‘nothing else like it’. If there is somehow a category of sui generis power with

determinable characteristics, whatever included therein would no longer be sui

generis. The test for what constitutes sui generis must necessarily be ad hoc.

249. As such, I am of the view that Thenuwara v. Chamal Rajapaksa (supra) and

Attorney-General v. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake (supra) did not try to define a new

class of power called ‘sui generis’ which can never be judicially tested. The cases merely

noted the power of the President regarding the impeachment of judges as being

unique for its manner of exercise, and nothing more must be read into it.

250. In regard to this argument of sui generis, the learned Additional Solicitor General

further submitted that “…classifying the President’s power of pardon under Article 34

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 104 of 306

as a sui generis power does not preclude this Court from subjecting a purported pardon

by the President to judicial review on the procedure. If the President has not followed

the procedure set out in Article 34 the President cannot be considered as having

exercised his power under Article 34 and said act would be null and void ab initio.”105

The crux of this submission is that, where the President has not exercised the power

in accordance with the procedure under Article 34, such exercise is no exercise of the

power of pardon, and therefore loses its sui generis character.

251. This submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General would essentially limit

judicial review of the power of pardon to the ground of procedural impropriety. As

such, any exercise of the power would not be reviewable on its merits.

252. The first case submitted in support of this was Maru Ram v. Union of India

(supra),106 wherein the Indian Supreme Court held,

“Consideration for exercise of power under Article 72/161 may be myriad and

their occasions protean, and are left to appropriate Government, but no

consideration nor occasion can be wholly irrelevant, irrational,

discriminatory or mala fide… only in these rare cases will the court

examine the exercise”107

253. I cannot help but see this as contrary to the position taken by the learned Additional

Solicitor General. All the grounds set out by the Indian Supreme Court therein would

enable a court to look beyond procedural impropriety. As noted in Kehar Singh v.

Union of India,108

“At the outset we think it should be clearly understood that we are confined to

the question as to the area and scope of the President’s power and not with the

question whether it has been truly exercised on the merits. Indeed, we think that

the order of the President cannot be subjected to judicial review on its merits

except within the strict limitations define in Maru Ram v. Union of India, (1981) 1

SCR 1196 at p. 1249; 1980 SC 2147 at pp. 2174-2175…”

254. While the cases of Maru Ram and Kehar Singh did not call for judicial intervention,

relying on the law set out therein, in the case of Swaran Singh v. State of Uttar

Pradesh,109 a grant of remission by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh was invalidated by

the Supreme Court of India. Commenting on the power of the Governor to grant a

pardon, it was held that,

“If such power was exercised arbitrarily, mala fide or in absolute disregard of the

finer cannons of the constitutionalism, the byproduct order cannot get the

approval of law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it.”110

255. As held in Epuru Sudhakar v. Government of A.P.,111 the exercise of the power of

pardon in India is reviewable under the following grounds:

“The position, therefore, is undeniable that judicial review of the order of the

President or the Governor under Art. 72 or Art. 161, as the case may be, is

available and their orders can be impugned on the following grounds:

(a) that the order has been passed without application of mind;

(b) that the order is mala fide;

109 (1998) 4 SCC 75

111 (2006) AIR 3385, at para 3

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 106 of 306

(c) that the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant

considerations;

(d) the relevant materials have been kept out of considerations;

(e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness.”

256. From the decisions aforementioned, I see no proclivity from the Supreme Court of

India to limit themselves to merely inquiring into procedural irregularities.

257. As I have noted earlier, even in England, being a constitutional monarchy where the

power exists as a royal prerogative, the Courts have not limited themselves in such a

manner. As Watkins L.J. held in R v. Home Secretary ex parte Bentley,112

“…The question is simply whether the nature and subject matter of the decision is

amenable to the judicial process. Are the courts qualified to deal with the matter

or does the decision involve such questions of policy that they should not intrude

because they are ill-equipped to do so? Looked at in this way there must be cases

in which the exercise of the royal prerogative is reviewable, in our judgment. If,

for example, it was clear that the Home Secretary had refused to pardon someone

solely on the ground of their sex, race or religion, the courts would be expected to

interfere and, in our judgment, would be entitled to do so.

We conclude therefore that some aspects of the exercise of the Royal prerogative

are amenable to the judicial process. We do not think that it is necessary for us to

say more than this in the instant case. It will be for other courts to decide on a

case by cases basis whether the aspect in question is reviewable or not.”

258. A similar attitude was taken in Burt v. Governor General,113 where it was held that

the refusal to exercise the prerogative of mercy should have the potential to be

112 [1993] 4 All ER 442

113 [1992] 3 N.Z.L.R. 672 at 678

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 107 of 306

reviewed to the extent that it is based on justiciable considerations. The central

attitude of the court was that each case had to be considered individually in light of

justiciability. Where a decision is heavily policy-laden, such a decision may potentially

be non-justiciable.

259. In this regard, the Doctrine of Political Question becomes very much relevant. The

Doctrine stands for the notion that where a question is fundamentally political, as

opposed to legal, courts should not inquire into the same as an apolitical organ of the

government.

260. Baker v. Carr114 is one case where the Doctrine was extensively considered by the

Supreme Court of the United States. It was held that,

“The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the

separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the 'political

question' label to obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a

matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch

of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever

authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional

interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter

of the Constitution….” 115

261. It was contended during the proceedings, chiefly by the 11A Respondent, that the

President must be answerable to the Parliament and not the courts, where he has

exercised the power of pardon in violation of the Constitution. However, in my view,

political accountability through the executive and legislative branches, and judicial

review through the courts need not be mutually exclusive.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 108 of 306

262. The learned Additional Solicitor General also invited this Court’s cognizance towards

the ‘Delegation Test’ and the ‘Alienation Test’ as propounded in the Special

Determination on the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution Bill.116

263. The Delegation Test sets out any change to the delegation of the people’s sovereignty

in terms of Article 4, which brings in another person or institution to exercise the

power of the other to be an infringement of Article 3 of the Constitution. The

Alienation Test sets out any transfer, relinquishment or removal of a power attributed

to one organ of government to another organ or body to be inconsistent with Article

3 read with Article 4 of the Constitution.

264. It was submitted that, as it is the President who is conferred with the power by Article

34, if the grant of pardon under this Article is “… reviewed on the merits by the Supreme

Court in exercise of fundamental rights jurisdiction it would fail the delegation test as it

would ‘bring in another person or institution’ into the exercise of such power”.117

265. It was further submitted that “it would also constitute a ‘transfer, relinquishment or

removal’ of a power attributed to the President to another as it would allow the

Supreme Court instead of the President to take decisions regarding who would

be given a pardon”.118

266. In this regard, I see it pertinent to cite the opinion of Wilson J. for the Canadian

Supreme Court in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen:119

“…the courts should not be too eager to relinquish their judicial review function

simply because they are called upon to exercise it in relation to weighty matters

of state. Equally, however, it is important to realize that judicial review is not the

same thing as substitution of the court’s opinion on the merits for the opinion of

the person or body to whom a discretionary decision-making power has been

committed…

… if the Court were simply being asked to express its opinion on the wisdom of

the executive's exercise of its defence powers in this case, the Court would have

to decline. It cannot substitute its opinion for that of the executive to whom the

decision-making power is given by the Constitution…

…if we are to look at the Constitution for the answer to the question whether it is

appropriate for the courts to "second guess" the executive on matters of defence,

we would conclude that it is not appropriate. However, if what we are being asked

to do is to decide whether any particular act of the executive violates the rights of

the citizens, then it is not only appropriate that we answer the question; it is our

obligation under the Charter to do so.”

267. The aforementioned was cited by the Constitutional Court of South Africa in the case

of The President of the Republic of South Africa and the Minister of Correctional

Services v. John Phillip Peter Hugo,120 where the pardoning power of the South

African President under the Interim Constitution was concerned.

268. In the case of Ryan Albutt v. Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation

and Others121 questions were raised regarding the rationality of the decision to

exclude victims of the crime from participating in a special dispensation process. It

was held by the Constitutional Court of South Africa that,

121 CCT 54/09 [2010] at 28

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 110 of 306

“… Courts may not interfere with the means selected simply because they do not

like them, or because there are other more appropriate means that could have

been selected. But, where the decision is challenged on the grounds of rationality,

courts are obliged to examine the means selected to determine whether they are

rationally related to the objective sought to be achieved. What must be stressed

is that the purpose of the enquiry is to determine not whether there are other

means that could have been used, but whether the means selected are rationally

related to the objective sought to be achieved…

The applicant very properly concedes that this Court has the constitutional

authority to examine whether the means adopted by the President are rationally

related to the objective sought to be achieved by granting pardons to those

convicted prisoners who claim to have committed offences with a political

motive.”

269. When an application, as provided for by Article 126, is made before the Supreme

Court, it is made in respect of an infringement or an imminent infringement of

fundamental rights by executive or administrative action. The jurisdiction of the Court

under Article 126 is to hear and determine any questions relating to the infringement

or imminent infringement of fundamental rights by such action. Needless to say,

whatever the factual matrix of such a case may be, the focal point this Court concerns

itself with is the fundamental rights of the populace as guaranteed by the supreme

law of the land.

270. The question we are concerned with is whether the actions of the President in granting

pardon have violated the rights of any one or more persons, and not as to whom it

must be granted. Where infringement of fundamental rights is alleged with regard to

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 111 of 306

any exercise of executive and administrative power, it is our sacred and solemn duty

to intervene, as the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights.122

271. As held in Premachandra v. Major Montague Jayawickrema,123

“When considering whether the exercise of a statutory power or discretion,

especially one conferred by our Constitution, is subject to review by the judiciary,

certain fundamental principles can never be overlooked. The first is that our

Constitution and system of government are founded on the Rule of Law; and to

prevent the erosion of that foundation is the primary function of an independent

judiciary.”

272. Where an authority acts ultra vires to the Constitution, it is such authority that defeats

itself. In reviewing whether any authority has exercised its power within the

constitutional limitations, the Court does not, and need not, assume its role. As Article

118(b) of the Constitution provides, the Supreme Court of the Republic exercises

jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights. Read with Article 4(d), it imposes

upon this Court a sacred and solemn duty to exercise its jurisdiction in a manner that

would protect, advance, secure and respect fundamental rights. In essence, this Court

is tasked with a Sisyphean calling to act as a protector of the Rule of Law, which is the

corollary of the duty imposed upon it by Article 4(d) read with Article 118(b) of the

Constitution.

273. I do not think I can better articulate this than Their Lordships of the Indian Supreme

Court have in Kehar Singh v. Union of India (supra):124

“… Indeed, we think that the order of the President cannot be subjected to judicial

122 Palihawadana v. Attorney-General [1978] 1 Sri LR 65 at 66

review on its merits except within the strict limitations defined in Maru Ram, etc.

v. Union of India. [1981] 1 S.C.R. 1196 at 1249. The function of determining

whether the act of a constitutional or statutory functionary falls within the

constitutional or legislative conferment of power, or is vitiated by self-

denial on an erroneous appreciation of the full amplitude of the power is

a matter for the court…

This Court in fact proceeded in State of Rajasthan and Others v. Union of India,

[1978] I S.C. R. 1 at 80-81 to hold:

"......So long as a question arises whether an authority under the Constitution

has acted within the limits of its power or exceeded it, it can certainly be decided

by the Court. Indeed it would be its Constitutional obligation to do so ......this Court

is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to this Court is assigned the

delicate task of determining what is the power conferred on each branch of

Government, whether it is limited, and if so. what are the limits and whether any

action of that branch transgresses such limits. It is for this Court to uphold the

Constitutional values and to enforce the Constitutional limitations. That is the

essence of the Rule of Law ...." and in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India. [1981]

1 S. C. R. 206 at 286-287, Bhagwati, J. said:

"....the question arises as to which authority must decide what are the limits

on the power conferred upon each organ or instrumentality of the State and

whether such limits are transgressed or exceeded……The Constitution has,

therefore, created an independent machinery for resolving these disputes and this

independent Machinery is the judiciary which is vested with the power of judicial

review......”” 125

125 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 113 of 306

Conclusion of the Court on Reviewability

274. At the very outset, I unequivocally reject the position taken by the learned Additional

Solicitor General to the effect that judicial review of the power of pardon must be

limited to a mere procedural inquiry. It is one that can be reviewed under any of the

GCHQ grounds, including proportionality.126 Though the obiter dicta of Lord Roskill in

the GCHQ Case plainly excluded the prerogative of mercy from the classes of

prerogative power which may be susceptible to judicial review, this is no longer the

accepted view in England.127 With the constitutionalization of administrative law,

various other grounds have been recognized as capable of invalidating a decision of

a public authority; but all such grounds necessarily fall within the broader limbs of

judicial review recognised in GCHQ.

275. This, however, does not mean that this Court would be competent to review any and

all decisions made by the President under Article 34. Whether a particular exercise of

Article 34 is one that should be subjected to judicial review is a question to be

determined with regard to the justiciability of the considerations. As I have already

adverted to, there are a myriad of considerations upon which this power may be

exercised. And some such considerations may conceivably be beyond the judicial

competence.

276. For example, where a pardon is based upon considerations of foreign policy, so long

as such a grant is in the public interest, a Court of law would hardly be the place to

debate such matters. To this extent, the Doctrine of Political Question is of

significance. Where the considerations of a pardon involve such questions of policy,

126 vide Council for the Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1984] UKHL 9 (GCHQ Case)

127 vide supra, R v. Home Secretary ex parte Bently [1993] 4 All ER 442; R v. Barry Foster [1985] 1 QB 115

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 114 of 306

should the courts prefer not to intrude because they are ill-equipped to intrude,

judicial forbearance may be judicious.

277. In this regard, this Court prefers the approach taken in R v. Home Secretary ex parte

Bently (supra).128 Watkins L.J. in Bentley rejected a test of reviewability based on the

justiciability of categories of power in favour of an examination of the court’s capacity

to weigh the competing interests and principles in each individual case. As such, I am

of the opinion that, as was done in Bentley, it must be left for the judges of each

individual case to determine the justiciability of the consideration upon which the

pardon is based, on a case-by-case basis.

278. In approaching this question of justiciability, the Court must first and foremost

appreciate the nature and content of the executive or administrative decision: that is

to say, the ‘considerations’ of the pardon. In this, the persons directly affected, and its

impact on the wider community beyond the parties of the case become relevant, for

this power is exercised in the public interest. The other most pertinent question is the

suitability of the court’s personnel and process to review a particular decision. It

cannot be gainsaid that courts of law may not be the appropriate forum or be suitably

equipped in all contexts and circumstances to carry out the functions which a judicial

review process of such policy laden questions would ideally demand of them. It is for

this very reason the concept of justiciability remains useful.

279. Wherever the president does not give reasons for the pardon, as in this case, a court

should not self-curtail its jurisdiction, by presuming the involvement of any non-

justiciable considerations. Furthermore, for judicial review is the norm, the burden to

prove a consideration non-justiciable shall be on such party which alleges it to be un-

justiciable. However, no authority can elude judicial scrutiny by merely invoking and

playing on the word ‘policy’. The Court must further inquire whether such policy

128 [1993] 4 All ER 442

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 115 of 306

considerations are a mere pretext towards fulfilling an ulterior motive. In addition,

where bad faith, improper motive or manifest unreasonableness is properly

established against any public authority, a court of law may strike down even the most

policy-laden decisions or actions of such authority.129

280. With regards to the Doctrine of Political Question and the reviewability of policy-laden

issues, I see it pertinent to note the following observations of the esteemed Bhagwati

J., as His Lordship then was, in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India:130

". . . it is true that if a question brought before the Court is purely a political

question not involving determination of any legal or constitutional right or

obligation, the Court would not entertain it, since the Court is concerned only with

adjudication of legal rights and liabilities. But merely because a question has a

political complexion, that by itself is no ground why the Court should shrink from

performing its duty under the Constitution if it raises an issue of constitutional

determination. Every constitutional question concerns the allocation and exercise

of governmental power and no constitutional question can, therefore, fail to be

political . . . It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Opinion of the Court

delivered by him in Baker v. Carr [(1962) 369 US 186] an epoch making decision

in American Constitutional history, that the mere fact that the suit seeks

protection of a political right does not mean that it presents a political question.

This was put in more emphatic terms in Nixon v. Harndon [(1926) 273 US 536],

by saying that such an objection 'is little more than a play upon words . . . Even

before Baker v. Carr, courts in the United States were dealing with a host of

questions 'political' in ordinary comprehension. Even the desegregation decision

of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education [(1953) 347 US 483], had a

129 vide R v. Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Hammersmith and Fulham LBC and others [1991] 1 AC 521; R v. Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex parte Dyer [1994] 1 All ER 375

130 AIR 1977 S.C. 1361

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 116 of 306

clearly political complexion . . . The Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr held that it

was within the competence of the Federal Courts to entertain an action

challenging a statute apportioning legislative districts as contrary to the equal

protection clause. This case clearly decided a controversy which was political in

character, namely, apportioning of legislative districts, so because a constitutional

question of violation of the equal protection clause was directly involved and that

question was plainly and indubitably within the jurisdiction of the Court to decide.

It will, therefore, be seen that merely because a question has a political colour,

the Court cannot fold its hands in despair and declare 'Judicial hands off'. So long

as a question arises whether an authority under the Constitution has acted within

the limits of its powers or exceeded it, it can certainly be decided by the Court.

Indeed it would be its constitutional obligation to do so . . . No one however highly

placed and no authority howsoever lofty can claim that it shall be the sole judge

of the extent of its power under the Constitution, or whether its action is within

the confines of such power laid down by the Constitution. This Court is the

ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate

task of determining whether it is limited, and if so, what are its limits and whether

any action of that branch transgresses such limits. It is for this Court to uphold

the constitutional values and to enforce the constitutional limitations. That is the

essence of the rule of law . . ." 131

281. I do not think any more needs to be said than His Lordship has on the matter. The

exact passage I have cited above has been cited with approval by this Court in

Premachandra v. Major Mantague Jayawickrema,132 and I, too, find myself in total

agreement with it.

282. An overly limited approach to this issue of justiciability can mean that an illegal

decision, a decision which fails tests of Wednesbury reasonableness or

proportionality, may survive to perpetuate unfairness. Accordingly, a court of law must

not sit idle and be lethargic where the great basic rights enshrined in the Constitution

are threatened. Article 4(d) read with Article 118(b) of the Constitution demands that

it be a proactive guardian of such rights as the protector and guarantor of

fundamental rights. Only then can the fundamental right enshrined under Article 17

be meaningful. It is for this very purpose the Constitution has vested in this Court the

power to grant such relief or make such directions as it may deem just and equitable

in any circumstances.133

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE IMPUGNED SECOND PARDON

283. Much of the documentary material relating to the 1st and 2nd Pardon, which are

instrumental in casu, were not initially produced before this Court. It was only once

this Court made directions to procure the same were they produced by the

Presidential Secretariat.

284. The 11A Respondent asserted that he did not have access to the said documentary

material as he ceased to hold office as the President on or about 17th November 2019.

He further asserted that, when he requested said documentary material from his

successor, he was informed that they were not available. Thereafter, by way of a Right

to Information (RTI) request to the Ministry of Justice, he had obtained some—but

not all—of the said documents, which were then filed before this Court. It was also

observable that while the 11A Respondent had sent an RTI request to the Ministry of

Justice to obtain the documents relating to the pardon therefrom, a similar request

has not been made to procure any material from the Presidential Secretariat.

133 vide Article 126(4) of the Constitution

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 118 of 306

285. While I do not wish to dwell on the frail excuses, I am left wondering why he would

be so inclined to accept as true any such statements as to the unavailability of

documents. If he perused such necessary documents in granting the pardon, as he

ought to have, he must have been well aware of the fact that they were, in fact,

available.

286. Be that as it may, the aforementioned documentary material were finally produced by

the Presidential Secretariat as they appear to have wondrously materialized following

the directions made by this Court.

Requests/Petitions/Appeals for Pardon

287. Article 34 of the Constitution does not expressly require a request, appeal, plea,

petition, etc., to be made for a presidential pardon to be granted. As such, the mere

absence of a request for pardon will not ipso facto vitiate the validity of such pardon.

However, where any authority acts ex mero motu with no request made, either

pleading a pardon or inviting the authorities’ attention towards a prisoner, and any

authority grants or considers granting a pardon to a prisoner, the authority must

explain how and why the prisoner was so selected for such a grant. A presumption of

arbitrariness can be drawn where there is any failure on the part of such authority to

so explain, either at the time of granting the pardon or, at the least, when any aspect

of such pardon is challenged before a court of law.

288. In the instant case, it was contended that the pardon was granted pursuant to the

many requests made to His Excellency the President regarding the 2nd Respondent.

Presidential Secretariat File Ref. ‘PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017’, which includes the

documentation regarding the impugned 2nd Pardon, does contain many requests

made by Attorneys-at-Law, religious leaders and other groups. However, most of the

requests do not specifically refer to the 2nd Respondent, except for three requests, viz.

a formal petition for pardon made on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, two written pleas

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 119 of 306

to the President by the parents of the 2nd Respondent and a letter by Ven. Athuraliye

Rathana Thera M.P.

289. Among the general requests (those requests which do not make specific reference to

the 2nd Respondent) are the requests made by the Intervenient-Petitioners. As was

highlighted by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner, this Court observed

many such request letters to be identical, and even the ones which are not identical

are written in strikingly similar language. They had also been filed around the same

time. These facts are indicative of an effort in concert by all those involved. Be that as

it may, none of those request letters specifically refer to the 2nd Respondent.

290. As the Intervenient-Petitioners have stated in their affidavits, both dated 17th June

2023, they have only invited further attention of the former President towards taking

appropriate measures in furtherance of the education and rehabilitation of prisoners

in general, and young prisoners in particular. Despite this, as apparent from the Press

Release by the President’s Media Division dated 11th November 2019, the former

President, in arriving at his decision to pardon the 2nd Respondent, has clearly been

influenced by these general requests.

291. The said Press Release, which strictly relates to the impugned Pardon, states,

“…පූජ්‍ය බලංකගාඩ බුද්ධකගෝෂ ස්ථවිරයන් වහන්කස් ද කමවැනි උගත් තරුණ

[Ven. Balangoda Buddhagosha Thero, too, informed the President in writing as to

the importance of pardoning such educated young prisoners]

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 120 of 306

[Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of the

Southern Province pointed out, while presenting facts to the President, that his

blessings are also there with regards to the pardoning of educated prisoners who

have undergone self-rehabilitation and are serving life sentences]”

292. Most Rev. Dr. Wickramasinghe had issued an immediate clarification following this

Press Release seeking to better explain his involvement. This clarification, issued on

the same day, states as follows:

“I observed a statement from the President’s Media Division about the Presidential

Pardon for Royal Park Murder Convict… In the Sinhala Translation of the

statement, mentions clearly that I made a personal written request on behalf of

the Convict (Jude Shramantha Anthony Jayamaha). I wish to state that I have

not made any request on behalf of Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, neither to

the President nor to the respected Judiciary… However, a few years ago, I

recall, a group of Rev. Buddhist Monks and some Civil Society Members

approached me to make a written appeal to the President to pay attention to the

Prisoners, especially to the Young Detainees, help them to study and rehabilitate

them in a positive environment. We will continue to voice the same in the

future too.

I regret that our appeal was singled out to give an impression about this

particular case, which I believe is absolutely not acceptable…”

293. This clarification indeed reflects the true nature of the appeals made by the

Intervenient-Petitioners as well as most others mentioned in the Press Release. I fail

to see how any rational mind could interpret the contents of these appeals as relating

to any prisoners convicted of murder, or such other grave offences, let alone the 2nd

Respondent specifically.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 121 of 306

294. Among the specific requests, the foremost are the appeals to the then President by

letter dated 30th July 2017 by the mother of the 2nd Respondent, titled “අම්මා

කෙකෙකුකේ ෙණගාටුදායෙ තත්වය පිළිබඳ පැහැදිලි කිරීමට [to explain the grief of a

mother]” and the joint letter dated 13th June 2019 by the mother and father of the 2nd

Respondent. They are but appeals to pathos, and I do not see it necessary to be

analysed. It hardly comes as a surprise that parents would petition for their son’s

release.

295. Secondly, the President is claimed to have been influenced by an appeal made by Ven.

Athuraliye Rathana Thero M.P. The aforementioned Press Release dated 11th

November 2019 states, in this regard, that,

“…තරුණයාට ජ්‍ොධිපති සමාව ලබාදීම කවනුකවන් මුලිෙත්වය කගෙ ස්විකේෂී

lengthy explanation of the background.]

[Ven. Rathana Thero also made a written appeal to the President explaining that

the murder took place due to an argument over a love affair between the youth

and the young girl and Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha, while serving his

sentence in prison with good behaviour and conduct and undertook studies to

successfully complete his external degree and now working for his PhD and he is

an intelligent young man with a pleasant personality. He appealed to consider

the above and release him on a Presidential pardon…]

296. The Presidential Secretariat File Ref. ‘PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017’ also contains the said

written appeal purportedly made by Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera. However, while

this undated appeal is printed on a Parliament letterhead, it bears neither a signature

nor an official seal or stamp of the Thero. The content therein, too, must trouble any

reasonable person. It states, inter alia, the following:

“…බන්ධොගාර ගතව සිටියදී මරණ දඩුවම නියම වූ පසු ඔහු මත්රවයට ඇබ්බැහි ී

134 Translations are a verbatim reproduction of the translations as appeared in Press Release, ‘Clarification on presidential pardon’ (Newslk, 11 November 2019) https://www.news.lk/news/politics/item/28178-clarification-on-presidential-pardon, produced marked ‘X2’ by the Petition of the Intervenient-Petitioners

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 123 of 306

[…During his imprisonment, after being sentenced to death, he was addicted to

drugs. This youth was rehabilitated and transferred from Magazine Prison to the

Kuruwita Prison. It has now been 5 years. He has completed up to a Doctorate in

Economics from Oxford University…]”.135

297. The contents of this written appeal should ring instant alarm bells in any rational

mind—including the obvious falsity of some claims, a Member of Parliament

somehow having access to and the ability to transfer prisoners, and a Parliament

letterhead bearing such information without a date or signature. Despite such

concerns, in a puzzling move, the President has, in fact, acted upon this written letter

of appeal. Written on the face of this appeal are the instructions of the President to

the Additional Secretary (Legal), signed by His Excellency, directing her to “ෙථාෙරන්ෙ

[speak]”. The palpably dubious nature of these appeals the President has clearly relied

upon is prima facie indicative of an ill-considered, imprudent and arbitrary course of

conduct.

Report of the Trial Judge

298. The foremost requirement set out under the proviso to Article 34(1) is for the

President to “cause a report to be made to him by the judge who tried the case”. Perusal

of the documentary material before us reveals that officers of the Presidential

Secretariat Office have long acted under a fallacious understanding to the effect that

the report of the trial judge contemplated in Article 34 of the Constitution and the

report contemplated in Section 286(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15

of 1979 are one and the same. This is, of course, not the case. The procurement of a

286(b) report can in no way amount to compliance with the first requirement under

the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

135 Translation is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 124 of 306

299. Letter dated 14th July 2014—at the time of the 11A Respondent’s predecessor—

addressed to the Hon. Attorney-General from the Additional Secretary to the

President appears to suffer from the same mistake. It is clear that these officers have

committed this same mistake for well over a decade, at the least.

300. The Section 286(b) report is not one made in contemplation of a pardon. It is made

for an entirely different purpose. Section 286(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

provides as follows:

“… so soon as conveniently may be after sentence of death has been pronounced the

Judge of the High Court who presided at the trial or in case of his absence or inability

his colleague or successor in office shall forward to the President the notes of evidence

made by the Judge at the trial with a report in writing signed by him setting out his

opinion whether there are any and what reasons why the sentence of death should

or should not be carried out.”

301. While the report contemplated under 286(b) considers whether or not a sentence of

death should be carried out following a conviction, the Article 34 report concerns itself

with whether or not it is appropriate to pardon, remit or otherwise alter the effect of

a sentence of a prisoner as I have hitherto discussed.

302. The learned Counsel, in the course of the proceedings, raised questions as to the

nature of the report which must be obtained with regard to Trials-at-Bar and in

instances where the death sentence is given by an appellate court, as in the instant

case. When it comes to Trials-at-Bar, I am of the opinion that the report under Article

34 may either be a joint report by all the judges or three individual reports by each

judge.

303. If the sentence of death is imposed upon a prisoner by an appellate court, the reports,

either joint or individual, must be called from the judges of the appellate courts who

passed the death sentence in addition to the report/s by the judge/s of the original

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 125 of 306

court. While the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution only requires that “…the

President shall cause a report to be made to him by the Judge who tried the case…”,

it would be utterly artificial to merely call for a report from the High Court judge where

the apex courts in our judicial hierarchy have brought their wisdom in adjudicating

the appeals. Constitutional provisions, or even statutory provisions for that matter,

must always be interpreted in a manner that would make the provision meaningful.

304. Clearly, the intention of this provision, as manifested therefrom, is to enable the

President to be informed of all such considerations associated with a judicial sentence.

If the appellate judges who passed the sentence of death do not weigh in, this

intention would be frustrated. However, this would not be strictly necessary where the

appellate courts have only affirmed the decision of the High Court judge, unless the

President deems so necessary.

305. In the event of impossibility in obtaining this report, due to death, illness, old age or

any incapacity, the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia may apply, for interests of

justice should take precedence over technical conformity. It may be deemed sufficient

in such instances to call for a report from such judges who are still able to provide the

same, or even to substitute a 286(b) report under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

in lieu of the report contemplated under the proviso to Article 34(1) of the

Constitution. But this may only be done in cases of absolute impossibility.

306. In the instant case, it is apparent that the 11A Respondent and his subordinate officers

have acted under this misconception that reports contemplated under Section 286(b)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and Article 34 of the Constitution are one and

the same. As such, there is a clear failure to comply with the first requirement set out

under the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution. The pardon granted to the 2nd

Respondent can be struck down on this basis alone.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 126 of 306

Advice of the Attorney-General

307. The proviso to Article 34(1) secondly requires the President to forward the report

made by the judge who tried the case to the Attorney-General with instructions that

it be sent to the Minister of Justice with the Attorney-General’s advice thereon. It is

apparent from the word “thereon” that the advice of the Attorney-General must be

based on the report.

308. The Presidential Secretariat File Ref. ‘PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017’ contains but a single

letter by the Hon. Attorney-General addressed to the President. This letter dated 12th

September 2019 by Dappula de Livera, PC having set out the circumstances of the

offence committed by the 2nd Respondent, concludes as follows:

“…කමම ෙඩුවට අදාළ ඉහත සඳහන් ෙරෙ ලද ෙරුණු සහ විකේෂකයන් කමම සිදුීම

සිදුවෙ අවස්ථාකව් චූදිත ෙෲර හා අමානුෂිෙ අන්දමින් මරණෙරුට පහරදුන් ආොරය

සහ චූදිතකේ වයස සහ සිද්ධිකයන් පසු සහ වැරදිෙරු ීකමන් පසු ඔහුකේ හැසිරීමද

සැලකිල්ලලට කගෙ 2012.07.11 වෙ දිෙ අභියාචොධිෙරණය විසින් චූදිත අභියාචෙට

ලබාකදෙ ලද මරණ දඬුවම ියාත්මෙ කිරීම සුදුසුද යන්ෙ තීරණය කිරීමට සිදුවෙ

බව සඳහන් ෙළ යුතු කව්.

[…Whether it is appropriate to carry out the sentence of death imposed upon the

accused by the Court of Appeal on 11.07.2012 has to be decided by taking into

account the above-mentioned facts relating to this case and especially the

manner in which the accused brutally and inhumanly assaulted the deceased at

the time of the incident and the age of the accused and his behavior after the

incident as well as after being found guilty.]” 136

309. The content of this communication by the Attorney-General could not be further from

advice in support of granting a pardon to the 2nd Respondent. The above response of

136 Translation is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 127 of 306

the Attorney-General is only logical, as he was sent a Section 286(b) report seeking

advice thereon. As such, he has advised the President in line with the proper purpose

and function of a 286(b) report. It amounts in no way to a performance of the

Attorney-General’s role in granting a pardon as contemplated under the proviso to

Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

310. I cannot help but observe the role played by the Attorney-General in proceedings of

this nature as peculiar. The Attorney-General prosecuted the offender before the High

Court. And thereafter, the Attorney-General appealed against the conviction which he

deemed erroneous. According to Article 35, it is against the Attorney-General that an

application under Article 126 is to be made where the actions of an incumbent

President are to be challenged. In fact, under Article 134(1), the Attorney-General has

a right to be heard in all proceedings before the Supreme Court in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under Articles 120, [121, 122, 125], 126, 129(1) and 131. Balancing these

interests is by no means an easy task.

311. The solemn objective of any officers of the Attorney-General’s Department in

proceedings of this nature should be protecting and fostering the Rule of Law and

public interest. Needless to say, the duty imposed by Article 4(d) to respect, secure

and advance fundamental rights extends to the Attorney-General as well. This duty

was ever so clearly explained by Kodagoda J. in Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority:137

“In this regard, it is necessary to point out that, the primary duty of Attorneys-at-

Law is to assist Court in the due administration of justice. Their duties and

obligations towards their respective clients are subordinate to the duty they have

towards Court. This is more so with regard to officers of the Attorney General’s

Department, who are quite rightly deemed to be ministers of justice, due to some

137 SC FR 256/17, SC Minutes of 11 December 2020 at 24

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 128 of 306

of the quasi-judicial functions conferred on the office of the Attorney-General by

law. Therefore, officers of the Attorney General’s Department are required to

actively aid Court in the discovery of the truth and administer justice according

to law. It is of critical importance to bear in mind that, officers of the Attorney

General’s Department are duty bound to act in the best interests of the State, as

doing so would be in public interest. Thus, the overall objective of legal

professionals serving the State, should be the protection and fostering of public

interest. Protecting and acting in the best interests of the State and public officials,

is circumscribed by the overarching professional duty legal officers of the State

have towards Courts to assist in the administration of justice. Legal Officers of the

State are certainly not required and should not protect or defend public officials

who have committed any illegality or otherwise acted contrary to law.”

312. While the duty of the Attorney-General in proceedings under Article 126 has been so

set out by this Court in several instances, the exact nature of the duty of the Attorney-

General within the process set out under Article 34 of the Constitution remains ill-

defined.

313. I have hitherto discussed the relevancy of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims

of Crime and Witnesses Act and see no need to revisit the same. There exists no doubt

as to the right of a victim to have their grievances heard in the process of granting

pardon. The victims of the instant case, at the time of the impugned Pardon being

granted to the 2nd Respondent, were not granted this opportunity. The victims had

been deprived of a hearing, up until the fundamental rights application was taken up

before this Court. This is a rare case where the persons aggrieved by the offence had

the means of retaining the best of legal counsel. Undoubtedly, this will not always be

the case. The chances are that most will remain oblivious even to the fact that an

offender has been pardoned.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 129 of 306

314. It is for this reason the Attorney-General must represent the interests of any party

howsoever aggrieved by an offence. This duty is a corollary to the Attorney-General’s

duty to act in the public interest. In this sense, the advice of the Attorney-General to

the President, as contemplated under Article 34 of the Constitution, must necessarily

account for how the fundamental aims of the criminal justice system would be better

served by a presidential pardon.

Recommendations of the Minister of Justice

315. Once the advice of the Attorney-General is sent to the Minister of Justice along with

the report by the trial judge, the Minister is required to forward the report to the

President with his or her recommendations. The duty of the Minister, too, is

necessarily connected to the report prepared by the trial judge. The recommendations

of the Minister must be made in consideration of the advice of the Attorney-General

thereto.

316. However, the Presidential Secretariat File Ref. ‘PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017’ does not

contain any report or like communications from the Minister of Justice in relation to

the impugned 2nd Pardon. The Additional Secretary to the President (Legal), in a

memorandum dated 04th October 2019, observes the following in this regard:

“…එකහත්, ඉහත ෙරුණු කගෙ බැීකම් දී මරණීය දණ්ඩෙය ප්‍රොශ්‍යට පත් කිරීකමන්

but the Additional Secretary (Legal) has also given instructions to the President

categorically drawing His Excellency’s attention to these failures.

Conduct of the President and the Presidential Secretariat

318. The Additional Secretary to the President (Legal) in her memorandum to the

President/Secretary to the President dated 4th October 2019 has made the following

observations:

“…කමම අවස්ථාව වෙවිට නිසි ියාමාේග අනුගමෙය ෙරමින් කහෝ කොෙරමින් චූදිත

319. The Commissioner General of Prisons by letter dated 08th October 2019 to the

Secretary, Ministry of Justice and Prison Reforms has recommended that a Special

State Pardon in terms of Article 34 of the Constitution be granted to the categories of

prisoners he had specified therein. The said letter specifically excludes from its ambit

such prisoners convicted of any offences set out in Annexure 1 thereto and such

prisoners sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Despite this, as apparent from

Presidential Secretariat File Ref. ‘PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017’ Minute Sheet V, the

President has directed/ordered for the 2nd Respondent to be included within this

Special State Pardon.

320. The aforementioned memorandum from the Additional Secretary to the President

(Legal) addressed to the Secretary to the President, states the following:

Accordingly, your note dated 15 October 2019 has informed to carry out these

acts under the Special State Pardoning process.

However, according to the prison report, Special State Pardon has been proposed

for prisoners other than those sentenced to death and life imprisonment…

Therefore, the prisoner cannot be released under the Special State Pardon.

According to the provisions of the Constitution, the President has the power to

grant a full pardon or a pardon with any lawful conditions to this prisoner who is

serving sentence of life imprisonment.

Accordingly, I present the same for appropriate orders.]” 140

321. On this memorandum, written somewhat illegibly, is the order/direction of the

President stating “නිදහස් කිරීමට අනුමත ෙරමි [I approve to be released]”. It is upon this

order/direction alone the prisoner was released. Thereafter, by letter dated 04th

November 2019, the Secretary to the President (Acting) has communicated to the

Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Prison Reforms that the President has

approved the release of the 2nd Respondent.

322. The latter states,

“කදාන් ශ්‍මන්ත ජූ් ඇන්තනි ජ්‍යමහ යෙ අය නිදහස් කිරීම සඳහා අතිගරු

ජ්‍ොධිපතිතුමා විසින් අනුමැතිය ලබා දී ඇත… [His Excellency the President has

approved the release of Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha…]”

323. It is apparent from this course of conduct that the President has paid no mind to any

of the relevant considerations in granting the impugned Pardon. The President has

merely approved the decision made by someone else with no rhyme or reason. I agree

with Mr. Faiszer Mustapha, PC and the learned Additional Solicitor General in their

assertion that Article 34 requires no warrant to be issued by the President. That does

not mean, however, that a President can exercise this power so haphazardly as the

11A Respondent has done. There must be some sanctity involved in the decision,

making it attributable to the President.

Duty to Give Reasons

324. Both Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC and Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC argued that the

President is required to give reasons for his decisions to grant a presidential pardon

to any prisoners. The precise nature of the contention made by Mr. Sanjeeva

Jayawardena, PC was that the President should have reasons for granting a pardon,

even if such reasons were not communicated to the public at the time of granting the

pardon.

325. In the words of Lord Denning M.R. giving reasons is “one of the fundamentals of good

administration”.141 It is trite law that a duty to give reasons may be implied at common

law, particularly under circumstances where it prejudices the ability of persons to

successfully apply for judicial review or where such failure to give reasons amounts to

141 Breen v. AEU [1971] 2 QB 175 at 191

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 135 of 306

arbitrariness.142 In Epuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P (supra),143 with regard to the duty

to give reasons it was noted as follows:

“…In any event, the absence of any obligation to convey the reasons does not

mean that there should not be a legitimate or relevant reasons for passing the

order…

The position if the Government chooses not to disclose the reasons or the material

for the impugned action was stated in the words of Lord Upjohn in the landmark

decision in Padfield and Ors. v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and

Ors. (1968 (1) All ER 694) at p. 719:

“……if he does not give any reason for his decision it may be if circumstances

warrant it, that a Court may be at liberty to come to the conclusion that he had

no good reason for reaching that conclusion……”

The same approach was adopted by Justice Rustam S. Sidhwa of the Lahore High

Court in Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 Lah 725) where

at p. 775 para 13 the learned Judge observed as follows:

“I have no doubt that both Governments are not compelled to disclose all

the reasons they may have when dissolving the Assemblies… If they do not choose

to disclose all the material, but only some, it is their pigeon, for the case will be

decided on a judicial scrutiny of the limited material placed before the Court and

if it happens to be totally irrelevant or extraneous, they must suffer.”

Justice Sidhwa’s aforesaid observations have been referred to and approved in

S.R. Bommai’s case (supra) [1994 AIR SCW 2946].

Since there is a power of judicial review, however limited it may be, the same can

be rendered to be an exercise in futility in the absence of reasons.”

326. As noted, when reasons are not given, the court may presume the pardon to be given

on justiciable considerations and proceed to scrutinize the same. Moreover, where a

Petitioner is able to establish a prima facie case, it is for the authority to justify their

actions as reasonable. When no reasons are given in such instances, it stands to good

reason that a presumption of arbitrariness would result therefrom.

327. As Lord Pearce noted in Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,144

“If all the prima facie reasons seem to point in favour of his taking a certain course

to carry out the intentions of Parliament in respect of a power which it has given

him in that regard, and he gives no reason whatever for taking a contrary course,

the Court may infer that he has no good reason and that he is not using the power

given by Parliament to carry out its intentions.”145

328. In the words of Lord Keith in R v. Trade Secretary ex parte Lonrho PLC,146

“The absence of reasons for a decision where there is no duty to give them cannot

itself provide any support for the suggested irrationality of the decision. The only

significance of the absence of reasons is that if all other known facts and

circumstances appear to point overwhelmingly in favour of a different decision,

144 [1968] AC 997

146 (1989) at 620

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 137 of 306

the decision maker who has given no reasons cannot complain if the court draws

the inference that he has no rational reason for his decision”.

329. While some of the older authorities may suggest that there is no duty to give reasons

for a decision at the time of giving a decision, I do not see this a fit conclusion within

our law. This proposition may have held water sometime back, but the tide has now

changed. This is not to say that every routine and minute decision needs to be

substantiated in meticulous detail—that would be an absurdity. Admittedly, while

openness and transparency in administration might make it desirable to impose a

duty to give reasons at all times for all decisions no matter how small, such a

cumbersome duty would undoubtedly burden the public authorities to an

unwarranted degree. As with all things, a fair balance must be struck. According to

Prof. Wade,147 “… such a rule should not be unduly onerous, since reasons need never

be more elaborate than the nature of the case admits, but the presumption should be

in favour of giving reasons, rather than, as at present, in favour of withholding them…”.

330. As held in Sirimasiri Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner of Elections,148 by Shirani

Bandaranayake J., as Her Ladyship then was, with Amaratunga and Marsoof JJ.

agreeing,

“Accordingly an analysis of the attitude of the Courts since the beginning of the

20th century clearly indicates that despite the fact that there is no general duty

to give reasons for administrative decisions, the Courts have regarded the issue

in question as a matter affecting the concept of procedural fairness. Reasons for

an administrative decision are essential to correct any errors and thereby to

ensure that a person, who had suffered due to an unfair decision, is treated

according to the standard of fairness. In such a situation without a statement from

147 Administrative Law (9th edn, Oxford University Press 2004) at 527

148 (2009) 1 SLR 1

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 138 of 306

the person, who gave the impugned decision or the order, the decision process

would be flawed and the decision would create doubts in the minds of the

aggrieved person as well of the others, who would try to assess the validity of the

decision. Considering the present process in procedural fairness vis-à-vis, rights

of the people, there is no doubt that a statement of reasons for an administrative

decision is a necessary requirement…149

It is to be noted that there have been instances where Courts had quashed the

decisions when only vague reasons had been given (Re Poyser and Mills’

Arbitration ([1964] 2 Q.B. 467) or in circumstances where ambiguous reasons

were provided (R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner, Ex parte Howarth ((1968) 4

K.I.R. 621).” 150

331. In line with this, there is no doubt that there is a requirement to substantiate an

administrative decision by giving reasons where a decision affects the rights of any

person—or the rights of the populace in general. It need not be said that granting a

presidential pardon to any offender is a decision of that nature. However, I wish to

point out plainly that this duty to give reasons is not one which only applies to the

President in granting a presidential pardon. The duty also extends to the Attorney-

General and the Minister of Justice in performing their respective roles under the

proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

332. With regards to this duty to give reasons in granting a presidential pardon, we must

necessarily take into account the effect of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims

of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 10 of 2023. Section 5(1)(f) of the Act provides that a

victim of a crime shall have the right to “in the event of any person in authority

considering the grant of a pardon or remission of sentence imposed on any person

149 ibid at 11

150 ibid at 16

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 139 of 306

convicted of an offence, to receive notice thereof and submit through the Authority to

the person granting such pardon or remission, the manner in which the offence

committed has impacted on such victim of crime physically, emotionally,

psychologically, financially, professionally or in any other manner”.

333. In my view, the manner in which an offence would affect or impact the victim most

certainly includes the position a victim would be placed in when an offender is

released. A victim of a crime must be given notice of the fact that an authority is

considering the offender to be pardoned along with such reasons as to why the

offender is considered, so that a victim may meaningfully exercise their right to be

heard under Section 5(1)(f) of the Act.

Conclusion: Second Pardon

334. The most rudimentary requirement in exercising the pardoning power of the people

as vested in the President of the Republic by virtue of Article 34 of the Constitution is

to obtain the three constitutionally mandated reports under the proviso therein, viz.

of the Trial Judge, the Attorney-General and the Minister of Justice. Where the same

have not been obtained, the President, very simply, does not, and cannot, exercise the

power of pardon. Each step of this procedure set out under the proviso has a

proximate nexus to one another. Devoid of this nexus, there can be no compliance

with this procedure. Therefore, the failure to obtain the proper report from the judge

who tried the case alone leads to a causal sequence resulting in a total procedural

failure.

335. Mere mechanical compliance with the procedural requirements is strictly insufficient.

The report of the judge, advice of the Attorney-General and the recommendations of

the Minister must all be substantial and reveal that the relevant authority has applied

their mind to the matter in performing their respective duties under the Constitution.

A pardon must satisfy not only the procedural but also the substantive aspects of

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 140 of 306

Article 34. It is then—and only then—the discretion of the President to grant a pardon

comes alive.

336. The Counsel also raised objections with regard to the validity of the Committee

appointed by the Ministry of Justice to consider the commutation of sentences of

death row convicts. According to the submissions made by the learned Additional

Solicitor General, the said Committee was appointed by virtue of the Prisons

Ordinance, No. 16 of 1877. Even where no laws specifically provide for such

committees to be appointed, I see no reason why the Minister should be prevented

from appointing a committee to satisfy himself as to the recommendations to be

made in connection with granting a pardon.

337. In granting the 2nd Pardon, none of the requirements set out under the proviso have

been satisfied. There is a total failure to act in compliance with the constitutional

procedure. For this reason alone, I find the impugned 2nd Pardon ultra vires the

Constitution.

338. It does not appear from the record that the President has directed his mind to the

question of whether a pardon would be in the public benefit. Instead of considering

the deserving prisoners, whose release would better serve the ideals of criminal

justice, the record indicates that the President had clearly attempted to foist the 2nd

Respondent into an arrangement that would secure his release. This is apparent from

the President’s direction to include the prisoner within the Special State Pardon

scheme, even when it specifically excluded those serving life imprisonment. This Court

does not see how the impugned Pardon would serve the public interest, and the 11A

Respondent made no attempt to explain the same. Therefore, I find the impugned

Pardon to be an exercise of power for an improper purpose.

339. It is also apparent on the face of the record that the officials have made several

substantive errors in performing their functions, and also that the President has not

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 141 of 306

taken relevant considerations into account while being motivated by such other

considerations any prudent person would at once discard. The failure of the President

to give reasons for the decision and his actions in contravention of the legitimate

expectation of the victims arising out of Section 3(q) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 further adds to the list

of fatal mistakes committed in granting the pardons.

340. Seldom do you see a decision so conspicuously bad that it has committed nearly all

classes of malfeasances known to administrative law. The actions of the President

amount to such a blatant betrayal of the public trust, that it shocks the conscience of

this Court. For a decision so deeply laden with errors to stand would be a travesty of

justice. For the reasons hereinbefore set out, I find the impugned 2nd Pardon null and

void ab initio.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIRST PARDON

341. The validity of the 1st Pardon (a pardon en masse) was not expressly challenged by the

Petitioner. However, Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC as well as the learned Additional Solicitor

General, ardently argued the same to be bereft of any legal validity. While Mr. Saliya

Pieris, PC did not necessarily refute this contention, he invited this Court to be mindful

of how any pronouncement concerning the 1st Pardon may affect the 69 other

prisoners who were beneficiaries of it.

Reviewability of the First Pardon

342. Before this Court can go on to review the circumstances surrounding the 1st Pardon,

we must first consider if it is reviewable at all. The 1st Pardon was granted in May 2016

and this Petition was not filed until 13 November 2019. Article 126(2) of the

Constitution provides that where a person alleges an infringement or an imminent

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 142 of 306

infringement of fundamental rights by executive or administrative action, he must

apply by way of petition to the Supreme Court within one month thereof.

343. The precise language of Article 126(2) of the Constitution is as follows:

“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by

executive or administrative action, he may himself or by an Attorney-at-Law

on his behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of court

as may be in force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writing

addressed to such Court praying for relief or redress in respect of such

infringement…”151

344. The language places emphasis upon not only an act itself which is violative of

fundamental rights but also the consequences of an act which may be perceived as

violative of fundamental rights. In the exercise of its fundamental rights jurisdiction,

this Court has, by and large, favoured neither deontological nor consequentialist

perspectives, so to speak—and rightfully so. The Court has, historically, reviewed both

means and ends, as appropriate, without distinction when challenged. This attribute

is not resultant of individual idiosyncrasies of judicial minds, as some may be so

inclined to think. A balanced pluralistic approach which cerebrates a variety of ethical

principles and frameworks is always preferred in adjudicating matters of fundamental

human rights.

345. Any and all procedural rules, too, must be interpreted to better complement this

broad ethical framework. The term ‘thereof’ in Article 126(2) of the Constitution

cannot, therefore, be taken to contemplate only the executive or administrative acts

per se, but must be read to further include the latent consequences of such acts. An

151 Emphasis is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 143 of 306

executive or administrative act, which does not per se violate fundamental rights, may

well have latent effects that are violative of fundamental rights of the citizenry. Surely,

the framers of the Constitution could not have intended for such effects to go

unrectified.

346. ‘Thereof’ refers to, in this sense, not the executive or administrative act itself, but the

violation or imminent violation of fundamental rights—such violation may result from

the act itself or its effects, foreseen or unforeseen. This Court has jurisdiction to review

an act which may yet be a decade old, provided the violation is imminent or no older

than one month at such time a petitioner applies to the Court.

347. What has then been the effect of the 1st Pardon granted in 2016 which makes it

violative of fundamental rights, and thus reviewable, in the present day? If the 1st

Pardon were to be taken in isolation, it may prima facie appear as one which is not at

variance with the fundamental rights chapter. But, as I see, in the backdrop of the

instant case, it cannot be understood as an isolated act: It must be understood with

reference to what it has come to be—and what it has come to be is a crucial step in a

series of unlawful actions by the executive which ultimately led to the release of the

2nd Respondent. The release of the prisoner has much to do with the 1st Pardon as it

does with the 2nd Pardon.

348. The 2nd Pardon has given the 1st Pardon new life. The latter has been but an inchoate

phase in the grand scheme of things securing the release of the prisoner. It is based

on the purported effect of the 1st Pardon to convert his sentence of death to one of

life imprisonment that the 2nd Pardon was granted, as a result of which the prisoner

was released. To this end, the 1st and 2nd Pardons have operated in concert. As such,

the 1st Pardon was as operative as the 2nd Pardon in the alleged violation of

fundamental rights.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 144 of 306

349. I must note that, to this extent, the pardons granted to the other 69 death row

prisoners may be distinguishable. Those pardons, which were granted long back, have

not been so reanimated by subsequent actions to result in fresh violations of

fundamental rights, as has happened with the 1st Pardon granted to the 2nd

Respondent. In this context, the findings of this Court with regard to the 1st Pardon

should not prejudice nor extend to the other 69 prisoners whose sentences were

commuted thereby.

General Validity of a Pardon en masse

350. It is pertinent to note that the aforementioned 1st Pardon is a pardon es masse which

dealt with 70 death row prisoners. It can often be in the interest of the Republic and

its citizenry to not leave even the most deplorable of criminals to languish in the

grimmest of conditions on death row and see to it that they are released following

signs of reformation, as is often done commemorating revered holidays. I see no

reason as to why such pardons would be ipso facto invalid in law.

351. The law need not always rule with an iron fist—in fact, it must not. Notions of justice,

humanity, empathy and fairness are as much a part of the law as the black letter of

the legislature. However, when such notions are blatantly misused as a pretext or a

precursor to achieve the most unlawful and unreasonable of ends, the Courts of law

cannot look the other way, no matter how far-reaching the consequences.

352. As noted in the case of The President of the Republic of South Africa v. John Phillip

Peter Hugo,152

“Where the power of pardon or reprieve is used in general terms and there is an

“amnesty” accorded to a category or categories of prisoners, discrimination is

inherent. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and there will always be people on

152 CCT 11/96 at para 31

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 145 of 306

one side of the line who do not benefit and whose positions are not significantly

different to those of persons on the other side of the line who do benefit… Indeed,

there might well have been prisoners in the first category who, if assessed

individually, might have been considered to be more deserving pf a remission of

sentence than persons in the latter category.”

353. Therefore, an authority must take special care in dispensing their respective duties

with regard to presidential pardons of this nature. For a pardon en masse to be valid,

the President must necessarily pay mind to each individual offender separately and

give reasons for each prisoner separately. In addition, any category or categories of

prisoners so considered must be clustered together on a rational basis which would

stand objective scrutiny.

Conclusion: First Pardon

354. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted, with regards to the 1st Pardon,

that “…the President has failed to follow the due procedure in exercising his power of

pardon in this instance given that although said commutation is purported to be done

in accordance with Article 34 the lawful procedure mandated by the Constitution has

not been followed”.153 However, the 11A Respondent contended that there has been

substantial compliance with the procedure set out under the proviso to Article 34(1)

[…According to the provisions of the Constitution the following procedure must

• Accordingly, a report under 286(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act must be provided to the President by the High Court which passed

As such, it is apparent that the above steps have not been taken in commuting

356. The letter dated 12th May 2016 by the Minister of Justice to His Excellency states the

following, with reference to the report of the Committee to review prisoners on death

row:

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 148 of 306

357. Attached to this letter is a list of 70 prisoners, where the 2nd Respondent appears as

the 40th. The Committee has given its recommendation regarding the 2nd Respondent

on 11th May 2015. However, the Assistant Secretary to the President, by letter dated

14th July 2014 (during the incumbency of 11A Respondent’s predecessor), has

requested the Attorney-General to forward his advice regarding the 2nd Respondent

to the Minister of Justice, purportedly in pursuant to the orders made the President.

No reasons were adduced before this Court as to why this attempt was taken to set

Article 34 procedure in motion almost 10 months before the Committee

recommendation.

358. As I have set out earlier in this judgment, the recommendations of the Minister of

Justice are to be given having considered the advice of the Attorney-General on the

report prepared by the Judge who tried the case. In the instant case, the record does

not contain any documentation containing such advice of the Attorney-General nor

any report by the Judge who tried the case. The aforementioned letter also notes that

“(අදාළ වාේතා කම් සමඟ අමුණා ඇත) අකෙකුත් වාේතා ඉදිරිකේ දී එවනු ඇත [(Relevant

reports are attached herewith) Other reports will be sent in future]”. As such, it was

entirely unreasonable for the President to have acted on this letter in the absence of

such other reports.

359. Therefore, the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the 11A Respondent

that there had been substantial compliance to the procedure set out by law in

granting the 1st Pardon is a glaring non sequitur as there had been a total failure to

follow the procedure set out under the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution. For

this reason alone, this Court cannot resist the finding that the 1st Pardon, too, has ultra

vires the Constitution and, therefore, is null and void ab initio.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 149 of 306

LIABILITY OF THE RESPONDENTS

360. The guiding principles with regard to the liability of the State and the Respondents

have been exhaustively discussed in the Easter Sunday Case,154 and I see no need to

discuss the same. The principle of constitutional tort is now well-established in our

law.

361. The learned Additional Solicitor General contended the 11A Respondent alone to be

responsible for any lapses there may be in the exercise of the President’s power under

Article 34 of the Constitution, as the power of pardon is one which requires his

personal attention. He further submitted that “when the 11A Respondent made his

decision to pardon the 2nd Respondent, it may have been done under the colour of office,

but at the same, very much a personal decision for which no one else, including the

State can be held responsible”.155 The obvious purpose of this contention is to avoid

State liability. Both the learned Additional Solicitor General and the learned

President's Counsel for the 11A Respondent attempted to establish the office as

severable from its holder, but for two distinct purposes. While the learned Additional

Solicitor General contended the 11A Respondent to be solely liable, the 11A

Respondent vehemently contended that the State should bear sole responsibility for

he has only acted according to the advice given to him.

362. The position of the learned Additional Solicitor General was not so much a theoretical

one, which requires us to dwell deep into the jurisprudence, but simply that there are

no circumstances in the instant case attracting State liability. He argued that the

Constitution lays down a clear and specific procedure to be followed when the

154 SC/FR/163/2019, S.C. Minutes of 12 January 2023

155 Written Submission on behalf of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents dated 9th August 2023, p. 64 para 228

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 150 of 306

President grants pardon to a person condemned to death and that the State has, to

that extent, put in place the necessary procedure to prevent arbitrariness.

363. I find no sympathy with this submission. Indeed, the Constitution has put in place

guiding principles for all aspects of governance, but can that be read as a sufficient

safeguard against arbitrariness? This Court has many a time dealt with the attempts

of the State to place ultra vires acts of its officials beyond what is attributable to the

State. In my view, this submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General is but

another manifestation of the same line of argumentation.

364. In support of his position, the learned Additional Solicitor General invited the Court

to consider the following passage inter alia from the case of Kanda Udage Malika v.

D.M. Abeyratne, Police Constable, Kandaketiya Police Station,156

“It is illogical to hold the state responsible for acts committed by such officers in

pursuing their personal vengeance without the authorization or knowledge of the

persons in authority. This was also highlighted in Goonewardene V. Perera and

Others [1983] 1 Sri LR 305 (Soza, J.) as follows,

“The State no doubt cannot be made liable for such infringements as may

be committed in the course of the personal pursuits of a public officer of

to pay off his personal grudges. But infringements of Fundamental Rights

committed under colour of office by public officers must result in liability

being cast on the State.”

In light of the above, the phrase ‘colour of office’ is not limited to whether or not

the officers were in official uniform but includes factors surrounding the conduct

of the officers and the authority given to them. In the instant case the SC/ FR/

157/2014 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 25 acts committed by the errant officers were

156 SC/FR/157/2014, S.C. Minutes of 21 May 2021

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 151 of 306

not committed under the supervision or the orders of a senior officer. The state

has not in any manner approved nor shall approve such conduct. In considering

the facts laid before this court the acts of the officers were conducted in their

personal capacity and not in the ‘colour of office’”

365. The views I have expressed hitherto are in no way at variance with what is quoted

above. As the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted, State liability rests upon

the particulars of each individual case. An instance of purely private acts done by a

person who may be employed by the State is quite distinct from the Head of State

misusing the power entrusted upon him: the former involves no exercise of power at

all.

366. The instant case is one which concerns several cogs of a broken wheel. Officials other

than the 11A Respondent have played a role in what has transpired, some out of sheer

incaution and inaptitude—albeit not to an extent which renders them personally

liable. The complete and utterly imprudent manner in which the 11A Respondent has

conducted his official affairs has exacerbated such effects into proportions

unimaginable. For these reasons, I do not think this a case where State liability can be

avoided.

367. The totality of the 11A Respondent’s submissions was but a bid to evade personal

accountability. Citing other contentious pardons granted by his predecessors and

successors, the 11A Respondent submitted that he has not acted in a manner

unfamiliar to the presidency as his actions align with the modus operandi of granting

presidential pardons.157 To my mind, this is a case of the defence being worse than

the offence. To accept this absurdity would be to leave us in a perpetuating cycle of

157 Written Submission of the 11A Respondent dated 25th August 2023, pp. 21-22 paras 27-28

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 152 of 306

delinquencies. Past injustices do not justify present wrongdoings, and I loathe that we

have come to a point where it is necessary to pronounce this.

368. With regards to the 1st Pardon, he argued that, once the recommendations of the

Minister of Justice were received, it was reasonable for him to operate under the

assumption that all antecedent procedural requirements had been duly complied

with. As I have already observed, there have not been any definitive recommendations

or advice in favour of granting a presidential pardon to the 2nd Respondent. The words

“අකෙකුත් වාේතා ඉදිරිකේ දී එවනු ඇත [Other reports will be sent in future]” in the letter

dated 12th May 2016 from the Minister of Justice makes it amply clear that this letter

does not contain the final recommendations as contemplated under the proviso to

Article 34(1) of the Constitution. To presume compliance with all other procedural

steps solely based on the aforementioned letter is borderline farcical.

369. In addition to this, the 11A Respondent also submitted that he has at all times acted

in accordance with the advice of other officials and that it was reasonable for him to

place reliance on such advice as a lay president. The 11A Respondent further

submitted that he had been a Grama Niladhari and then a member of the Parliament

and a Minister, with no legal qualifications. Therefore, he argued that he had

committed no wrong in acting on the advice of State officials.

370. This perplexing notion of a lay president is not one known to law. To accept this

contention would be tantamount to effectively establishing incompetence as a

defence in our constitutional and administrative law jurisprudence. The maxim

ignorantia legis neminem excusat/ ignorantia juris non excusat/ ignorantia juris haud

excusat158 precludes even an illiterate man from pleading ignorance of the law.

158 These are but different forms of the same maxim

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 153 of 306

371. As held in Bandara v. Premachandra,159

“…the State must, in the public interest, expect high standards of efficiency and

service from public officers in their dealings with the administration and the

public. In the exercise of constitutional and statutory powers and jurisdictions, the

judiciary must endeavour to ensure that this expectation is realized...”

372. Shiranee Tilakawardane J. opined in Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika

Kumaratunga (Waters Edge Case) (supra)160 that,

“The Public Trust Doctrine, taken together with the Constitutional Directives of

Article 27, reveal that all state actors are so principally obliged to act in

furtherance of the trust of the People that they must follow this duty even when

a furtherance of this trust necessarily renders inadequate an act or omission that

would otherwise legally suffice. In other words, it is not enough to argue that

procedure has been followed, when procedural compliance results in a

violation of the public trust. That action was either taken or not taken due to

contravening orders from a superior or because reliance upon another

entity’s or individual’s discretion was deemed sufficient, is simply not a

defense afforded to state institutions or state actors” 161

373. A defence which cannot be afforded to state institutions or state actors, as

Tilakawardane J. has noted, is certainly not available to the Head of the State, the

Head of the Executive and of the Government.162

162 vide Article 30 of the Constitution

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 154 of 306

374. Moreover, the Additional Secretary to the President (Legal) in report dated 04th

October 2019, addressed to His Excellency the President/Secretary to the President

has made the following observation: “එබැවින් මරණ දඩුවම, ජීවිතාන්තය දක්වා සිර

දඩුවමක් බවට පත් කිරීකම් දී ඉහත පියවර කගෙ කොමැති බව පැහැදිලි කව්… [As such, it

is apparent that the above steps have not been taken in commuting the sentence of

death into a sentence of life imprisonment…].163 It is in this context the former President

has granted the impugned Pardon.

375. Clearly, the defence so taken up by the 11A Respondent is of no merit. It is but a

merely self-serving argument attempting to create a semblance of logicality in his

conduct pardoning the 2nd Respondent.

GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE EXERCISE

376. All parties, except for the Attorney-General, had no objections to this Court setting

out guidelines for the exercise of the power of pardon. I also wish to note that, despite

all Counsel agreeing to assist this Court in promulgating such guidelines, none of the

written submissions have honoured this undertaking. The learned Additional Solicitor

General, too, conceded the necessity to promulgate guidelines during the

proceedings but has nonetheless taken a completely conflicting position in the written

submissions.

377. In defence of this tergiversation, he relied upon Kehar Singh v. Union of India

(supra), where the Supreme Court of India observed that it was perhaps unnecessary

to spell out specific guidelines, and other cases such as Shatrughan Chauhan v.

163 Translation is mine

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 155 of 306

Union of India,164 The State of Haryana v. Raj Kular Bittu165 and Bikas Chatterjee

v. Union of India,166 which purportedly support this proposition.

378. However, it is apposite that we carefully examine the reason for this conclusion and

appreciate the context in which it is made. In Kehar Singh v. Union of India

(supra),167 the Court has unanimously held:

“…It seems to us that there is sufficient indication in the terms of Art. 72 and in

the history of the power enshrined in that provision as well as existing case law,

and specific guidelines need not be spelled out. Indeed, it may not be possible to lay

down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised guidelines, for we must

remember that the power under Article 72 is of the widest amplitude, can

contemplate a myriad kinds and categories of cases with facts and situations varying

from case to case, in which the merits and reasons of State may be profoundly

assisted by prevailing occasion and passing time. And it is of great significance that

the function itself enjoys high status in the constitutional scheme.”

379. I am in agreement with Their Lordships that it is unnecessary—or rather impracticable

—to draw out specific guidelines. While the Indian constitution and the common law

indeed provide guidelines as observed; per contra, our law in this regard is still at a

stage of infancy and the Constitution itself only provides guidelines with regards to

pardoning offenders sentenced to death. Be that as it may, the observations this Court

has made in this judgment remain equally applicable in principle in reviewing pardons

164 Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 34, 56, 136, 139, 141, 132, 187, 188, 190, 191, 192, 193/2013, S.C. India Minutes of 21 January 2014

165 SC/Criminal Appeal/721/2021, S.C. India Minutes of 03 August 2021

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 156 of 306

granted to convicts punished with sentences short of death—save for the

observations made with regard to the proviso to Article 34 of the Constitution.

380. As Their Lordships have observed, drawing specific guidelines with regard to the

exercise of any power that is so wide in amplitude carries with it many challenges and

Constitutional dangers. Perhaps, this is why all the Counsel failed in their undertaking

to assist this Court in setting out such guidelines. Even if all-encompassing and

thoroughgoing guidelines are drafted through much labour, it will not be long before

such guidelines are outmoded.

381. For these reasons, I am in agreement with the learned Additional Solicitor General in

that it is not necessary for this Court to promulgate specific guidelines for the exercise

of the power of pardon.

CONCLUSION OF THE COURT AND CONSEQUENTIAL ORDERS

382. For the many improprieties associated with the 1st and 2nd Pardons granted to the 11A

Respondent, I hold both the 1st and 2nd Pardons null and void ab initio and of no force

or avail in law. As a result, the status quo ante the 1st Pardon is to be reverted. The 2nd

Respondent, Don Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha, is henceforth to be

considered a convict on death row.

383. The Attorney-General and all relevant authorities are hereby directed to take all

required steps towards his extradition arrangements: Necessary orders to be issued

by the High Court of Colombo.

384. Furthermore, I find that the Petitioner has successfully established the 11A

Respondent to have intentionally acted in a manner entirely abhorrent to the Rule of

Law in direct violation of the Constitution. The 11A Respondent has thereby violated

the fundamental rights of the Petitioner, 9th and 10th Respondents, and of the people

and the citizenry of Sri Lanka as enshrined under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 157 of 306

385. I have already adverted to the facts underlying the liability of Respondents. I do not

see how it would be just and equitable to burden the taxpayer for the malfeasances

we have uncovered as they have already paid dearly for these proceedings and now

towards the cost of extradition, among other things.

386. Taking into account the totality of the circumstances of this case, the Court orders as

follows:

I. The 11A Respondent is directed to pay as compensation a nominal sum of Rs

1,000,000/- (Rupees One Million) to the 9th Respondent and a nominal sum of

Rs. 1,000,000/- (Rupees One Million) to the 10th Respondent. The total sum is

to be paid within one months from the judgment.

II. The 11A Respondent is further directed to pay the costs of this litigation to the

Petitioner as well as the 9th and 10th Respondents.

III. The State is directed to pay as compensation a sum of Rs 100/- (Rupees One

Hundred) to the 9th Respondent and a sum of Rs. 100/- (Rupees One Hundred)

to the 10th Respondent, within one months from the judgment.

387. I am mindful of the fact that pain, suffering and psychological distress the 9th and 10th

Respondents have had to endure over the years, resulting from the felony itself to the

unlawful and arbitrary executive acts which denied them justice. No amount of

financial recompense may make amends—nonetheless, let this be symbolic.

Application Allowed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 158 of 306

YASANTHA KODAGODA, PC, J

388. Honourable Justice S. Thurairaja shared with me a draft of the judgment he proposes

to deliver in this matter. I have had the occasion to read and consider that draft

judgment. I find myself in agreement with the main finding contained in the draft

judgment, that being the impugned grant of the two pardons by the 11A Respondent

to the 2nd Respondent are unlawful and have no force of law. However, in view of the

salutary importance of this matter, particularly from the perspective of constitutional

and public law and the significance of the several questions of law argued by learned

counsel, I have deemed it necessary to pronounce my own judgment. I am conscious

that the primary question of law and facts considered by this Court, namely judicial

review of a pardon granted by His Excellency the President, has so far been considered

by the Supreme Court only on one previous occasion, and the judgment of this Court

with regard to that matter was pronounced very recently. In the course of this

judgment, I propose to refer to some of the findings contained in that judgment, with

which I respectfully find myself in agreement.

Parties to the case and Public Interest Litigation

389. The Petitioner – Women & Media Collective is a non-profit organization dedicated to

inter-alia, the promotion and the protection of the rights of women. The 1st

Respondent is the Honourable Attorney General. The 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents are,

respectively the Commissioner General of Prisons, Controller General of Immigration

and Emigration and the (Acting) Inspector General of Police (at the time this matter

was argued). The 6th Respondent (both the original and the three substituted) are

former Ministers of Justice and the present Minister. The 7th, 8th and the Respondent

substituted for the 8th Respondent are respectively the former President of the Bar

Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), the present President of the BASL, and the former

Secretary of the BASL. The 9th and the 10th Respondents are the father and the sister

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 159 of 306

of one Yvonne Johnson, the committing of whose murder the 2nd Respondent – Don

Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha had been convicted of by the Court of Appeal.

The 11A Respondent is His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the former President of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. It is the 11A Respondent who had

purportedly granted two pardons to the 2nd Respondent, which taken as a whole is

the subject matter of the Application.

390. The Petitioner claimed without contest from all Respondents excluding the 11A

Respondent that this Application was filed in public and societal interest and that they

had the right to do so. It is important to note that all Respondents except the 11A

Respondent claimed that the impugned decision of the 11A Respondent to grant a

pardon to the 2nd Respondent was a matter of public importance. The position of the

11A Respondent was that this is an instance of ‘selective call’ by the Petitioner for

‘accountability and justice’. A consideration of the material placed before this Court

and the organizational mandate of the Petitioner, it is evident that Petitioner has

sufficient and genuine interest in advocating matters of this nature, and similar

matters of constitutional and public law importance, particularly where is relates to

the rights and interests of women. In the circumstances, this Court decided that this

Application should be treated as an instance of public interest litigation. That is the

basis on which this Court took the initiative of calling for and examining certain

documents from the office of the President (commonly referred to as the “Presidential

Secretariat”) which were not pleaded by any of the parties to this Application. This

Court is acutely conscious that particularly in matters of public interest, this Court

should, in appropriate instances in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in this Court

by Article 118(b) of the Constitution, not limit the examination of the matter being

adjudicated upon, to the ‘pleadings’ filed by parties and to the ‘evidence’ placed

before Court. Where appropriate, in the interest of justice, the Court should proceed

to an inquisitorial mode of adjudication and proactively call for and examine other

relevant material. That is for the purpose of gaining a comprehensive understanding

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 160 of 306

of the attendant facts and circumstances of the matter which has to be adjudicated

upon. That is a matter where the Court exercises discretion and does so in the interest

of justice.

Background

391. Before I venture to deal with the facts and attendant circumstances pertaining to the

impugned presidential pardon granted to the 2nd Respondent – Shramantha Jude

Jayamaha by the 11A Respondent, I believe it would be appropriate to provide in

some detail a narrative regarding the 2nd Respondent and his encounter with the

criminal justice system.

392. On 12th October 2005, the 1st Respondent – Attorney General indicted the 2nd

Respondent in the High Court of Colombo for having on 1st July 2005, in Rajagiriya,

committed the murder of Yvonne Johnson and thereby committing the offence of

‘murder’ which in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code, is punishable with death.

According to the evidence presented to the High Court by the prosecution, the

murder of Yvonne Johnson (a young girl of 19 years, belonging to the upper echelons

of society, the daughter of the 9th Respondent and elder sister of the 10th Respondent)

had been committed on a staircase linking the 18th and 19th floors of tower ‘B’ of a

condominium housing complex named the “Royal Park Residencies”. Thus, the highly

publicized criminal trial against the 2nd Respondent became entrenched in the public

knowledge domain as the “Royal Park Murder Case”.

393. The trial in the High Court (Case No. HC 2722/2005) took place before a Judge of the

High Court who sat without a jury. Following trial, on 28th July 2006, the learned Judge

of the High Court found the accused ‘guilty’ for the lesser offence of ‘culpable

homicide not amounting to murder’ on the basis of the 4th limb of section 294 of the

Penal Code (knowledge) read with the 4th exception of the definition of the offence

of murder, and convicted him of such lesser offence. The convicted accused was

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 161 of 306

sentenced to serve a punishment of twelve (12) years rigorous imprisonment and to

the payment of a fine of Three Hundred Thousand Rupees (Rs. 300,000.00).

394. Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, the convicted accused (2nd

Respondent) appealed to the Court of Appeal. Also being aggrieved by the trial judge

not having found the accused guilty of committing the offence of murder, the

Attorney General (1st Respondent) also appealed to the Court of Appeal. These ‘cross-

appeals’ as they are generally referred to, were taken up together and heard by a

bench of two Justices of the Court of Appeal, in a consolidated appellate hearing.

Delivering judgment dated 11th July 2012, the Court of Appeal dismissed the Appeal

of the accused – appellant and allowed the appeal of the Attorney General.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction for ‘culpable homicide not

amounting to murder’ imposed by the High Court, and substituted that conviction

with a conviction for the offence of ‘murder’. Accordingly, the accused - appellant was

sentenced to suffer ‘death’.

395. Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the sentence imposed

by the Court of Appeal on the 2nd Respondent satisfied both broad theories of

punishment, being ‘punitive justice’ and ‘deterrent justice’. It is necessary to note that,

as regards the state of mind of the 2nd Respondent – Shramantha Jude Jayamaha at

the time of causing the death of Yvonne Johnson, the Court of Appeal in its judgment

has observed that “according to the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the

inhuman and the gruesome manner in which the murder was committed clearly shows

the murderous intention the accused appellant entertained …”. The Court of Appeal

also arrived at a finding that the murder was premeditated. Further, the judgment of

the Court of Appeal reveals clearly that, given the evidence resented, none of the

exceptions to culpability for ‘murder’ which would reduce culpability from ‘murder’ to

‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’ were applicable.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 162 of 306

396. By filing an Application in the Supreme Court, the accused – appellant (Shramantha

Jude Jayamaha) now found ’guilty’ by the Court of Appeal for having committed

‘murder’, sought Special Leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment

of the Court of Appeal. Having heard counsel for Shramantha Jude Jayamaha and the

Attorney-General, on 22nd October 2013, the Supreme Court refused the grant of

Special Leave to Appeal, thereby ending the criminal justice response to the offence

of murder committed by the 2nd Respondent – Shramantha Jude Jayamaha. As the 2nd

Respondent stood convicted for having committed the murder of Yvonne Johnson,

he was sentenced to suffer ‘death’.

397. From that point onwards commenced the management of the penal sanctions

imposed by the Court of Appeal on the convict – 2nd Respondent. Thus, the 2nd

Respondent was detained in the ‘death row’ pending his execution. It is noteworthy

that execution of persons sentenced to ‘death’ has not taken place in Sri Lanka since

1974, as it is a matter in public record that there exists a de-facto moratorium on

executions.

398. Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena and the

learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents Dr. Romesh De Silva

submitted that the crime (offence) committed by the 2nd Respondent was heinous,

horrendous and utterly gruesome, and that his conduct was pregnant with extreme

barbarism and should shock the collective conscience of any civilized society. Court

did not hear learned President Counsel for the 11A Respondent (the former President)

stating otherwise. Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner and the President’s

Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents vehemently argued that the punishment

imposed on the 2nd Respondent by the Court of Appeal and indirectly approved by

the Supreme Court when it refused the grant of Special Leave to Appeal, should not

have been even indirectly set-aside by the 11A Respondent – the former President,

through any form of pardon. They lay heavy emphasis on their assertion that the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 163 of 306

interests of society can be served only by a person such as the 2nd Respondent being

detained in the death row till his natural death. I noted with a sense of relief that

neither of the President’s Counsel for the Petitioner or 9th and 10th Respondents

advanced the view that execution of prisoners in the death row should take place in

this country.

399. Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that, “… His Excellency

Maithripala Sirisena, in a move that has shocked and left the public aghast, purported

to invoke his powers under Article 34 of the Constitution, and granted a Presidential

Pardon to the accused. … This stunningly obnoxious move on the part of the President,

especially in respect of a convict on death row, who has been sentenced both by the

Court of Appeal which is the penultimate court of the country, as well as the Supreme

Court, which is the apex court, on the eve of the relinquishment of his term of office as

President, has led to concerted public censure both locally as well as internationally, and

brought the criminal justice system to ridicule. Apart from subverting the court of justice,

it had also rendered naught the entire processes which took place, inter alia, before the

Court of Appeal as well as Your Lordship’s Court and the due application of the prevalent

laws of the country, …”.

Grant of Presidential Pardon to the 2nd Respondent

400. The Petitioner filed the instant Application following the 2nd Respondent having been

granted a purported pardon by the 11A Respondent (who at the time of the grant of

the impugned purported pardon, was serving as the President) acting purportedly

under Article 34 of the Constitution. That pardon resulted in the 2nd Respondent being

set free (released from prison). The Petitioner premised his case on the footing that

while the 2nd Respondent was in the death row awaiting his execution, the President

had granted the impugned pardon. However, when pleadings were filed and this

Court examined additional material called for and received from the office of the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 164 of 306

President (Presidential Secretariat), it transpired that, on 17th May 2016, the 11A

Respondent had granted a pardon to the 2nd Respondent and sixty-nine (69) other

prisoners who had been sentenced to death and at that time being detained in the

death row. That purported pardon resulted in the commutation of the sentence the

2nd Respondent was serving, from the ‘death sentence’ to ’life imprisonment’.

Thereafter, on 29th October 2019, the 11A Respondent had once again granted

another pardon to only the 2nd Respondent which resulted in the 2nd Respondent

being released from prison and set free.

401. In the circumstances, it is necessary to consider in some detail the sequence of events

and attendant circumstances relating to the grant of both purported pardons.

First Presidential Pardon granted to the 2nd Respondent

402. Though not presented to this Court as evidence by the Petitioner and the

Respondents, the material called for from the Presidential Secretariat and examined

by this Court revealed that by letter dated 14th July 2014, sent on behalf of the

Secretary to the President, an Assistant Secretary to the President had notified the

Attorney-General that on the direction of the President, the Attorney-General was

“required in terms of Article 34(1) of the Constitution to submit to the Minister of Justice

his views regarding the report of the High Court judge prepared in terms of section

286(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act regarding High Court Colombo case No.

HC 2722/2005”. The letter indicates that the afore-stated ‘report’ was attached to the

letter. The relevant file (No. PS/CSA/00/9/3/67) maintained by the Presidential

Secretariat offers no clue as to the circumstances which led to this letter being sent.

Nor did the submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor General offer any

explanation in this regard. This court found no basis to conclude that this letter was

dispatched as part of a routine process followed by the Presidential Secretariat with

regard to all prisoners in the death row. It is to be noted that this letter had been sent

during the Presidency of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is not a party to

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 165 of 306

this Application. One can only speculate that a person acting on behalf of the 2nd

Respondent – Shramantha Jude Jayamaha may have submitted a plea for a pardon,

to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which resulted in the Presidential Secretariat

seeking the views of the Attorney-General. However, it remains a mystery as to why

the Presidential Secretariat did not attach to the afore-stated letter addressed to the

Attorney-General, the purported ‘report’ of the Judge who convicted the 2nd

Respondent for having committed murder and sentenced him to death, though there

is a reference to such report in the letter.

403. Learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that an examination of Attorney

General’s Department file No. CR1/204/2005 (which he submitted is the file in which

the afore-stated letter dated 14th July 2014 has been filed) does not contain the

attachment referred to (report of the High Court judge) in the afore-stated letter.

When inquiries were made in this regard, learned ASG submitted that he was unaware

of the existence of such a ‘report’ prepared in terms of section 286(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA). Furthermore, an examination of the original letter

received by the Attorney-General which the learned ASG submitted to this Court,

reveals that it does not contain two punctures, an item of circumstantial evidence

which one would expect to exist, should there have been a document stapled to it,

and the staple subsequently removed. Nor was there a clip or marks of corrosion that

is generally seen in locations where there has been a paper clip. In fact, an examination

of Presidential Secretariat’s original file No. PS/CSA/00/9/3/67 also reveals that it also

does not contain the report said to have been submitted by the learned judge of the

Court of Appeal. All these circumstances point towards the irresistible conclusion that

no such report had been filed of record in the file maintained by the Presidential

Secretariat, and that the Assistant Secretary did not forward such report to the

Honourable Attorney-General. If that be the case, upon receipt of the said letter, why

didn’t the Attorney-General call for it, as the letter referred to such a report? Learned

ASG had no explanation to offer to this Court in that regard.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 166 of 306

404. Instead of calling for the report referred to in the afore-stated letter dated 14th July

2014, the Attorney-General chose to reply to the said letter (though section 286 of

the CCPA does not confer any statutory duty for the Attorney-General to perform with

regard to the Report of the High Court Judge) directly to His Excellency the President.

He did so, instead of forwarding his observations to the Minister of Justice, which is a

procedural step contained in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

Moreover, the report prepared by the High Court Judge in terms of section 286 (b) of

the CCPA is only for the purpose of enabling the President to, based on notes of

evidence and reasons given by the Judge, decide whether the sentence of death

should be carried out or not. It is not the report that is contemplated in the proviso

to Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

405. By his letter dated 1st October 2014, the Attorney General of the day wrote to His

Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa (the then President) commencing by giving an outline

of the case. The Attorney General has expressed the view that “the available material

does not suggest that it was a pre-mediated murder …” (That observation of the

Attorney General is contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeal, which the court

arrived at sequel to the Attorney General’s own appeal to that court, and the

submissions made in that regard by counsel representing the Attorney General.) He

further expressed the view that “… considering the above facts and the circumstances

of this case, especially the age of the accused at the time of the incident and his post-

conviction conduct, in my view this is not a fit case for the execution of the death

sentence imposed on the accused appellant by the Court of Appeal on 11.07.2012”.

Subject to that, the Attorney-General did not recommend any respite or the grant of

a pardon to the 2nd Respondent.

406. This letter has been copied to the Secretary, Ministry of Justice. An examination of

Presidential Secretariat’s file No. PS/CSA/00/9/3/67 does not reveal any further action

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 167 of 306

having been taken regarding this matter, during the pendency of the term of office of

then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

407. From the material presented to this Court, it appears that the 6th Respondent -

Minister of Justice had appointed a ‘Review Committee’ headed by a retired judge,

which had been mandated with the task of submitting to him a report on whether the

sentence of death imposed on convicts and thus are in the death row should be

commuted to life imprisonment. Learned Additional Solicitor General did not cite a

specific provision of the law in terms of which the Committee was established. Thus,

this Court concludes that it has been administratively created to aid the Minister of

Justice. Learned ASG did advert to the fact that this Committee had been in existence

for a considerable period of time in the past. The Committee had interviewed all those

who had been sentenced to death up to 26th September 2013 and whose appeals to

superior courts had been finally disposed of. For each prisoner interviewed, the

Committee has prepared a report and submitted a collection of such reports to the

Minister of Justice. The said Committee has recommended that the sentence of death

imposed on seventy (70) convicts be ‘commuted’ to life imprisonment.

408. Among the afore-stated seventy (70) prisoners, was the 2nd Respondent. He had been

interviewed by the Committee, and having taken into consideration several factors,

on 11th May 2015, the members of the Committee recommended that the sentence

of death imposed on the 2nd Respondent – Shramantha Jude Jayamaha be

‘commuted’ to life imprisonment. Among the factors the Committee has taken into

consideration, are the following:

(i) that at the time of the incident, the prisoner was 19 years of age;

(ii) that prior to the date of the murder, there had been no previous

acrimonious incident between the deceased and the prisoner;

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 168 of 306

(iii) that the deceased, the sister of the deceased (who was the girl-friend of

the prisoner) and the prisoner were persons who used to frequent clubs,

consume alcohol and take drugs;

(iv) that the family background of the prisoner had contributed to his

character;

(v) that the encounter between the deceased and the offender which led to

the murder of the deceased, was accidental;

(vi) that it was the deceased who had initiated the row with the prisoner; and

(vii) that the killing was not premeditated.

409. The Report indicates that it was the 2nd Respondent who had provided a narrative of

what happened on the day of the murder. Further, it does not appear that the

Committee had read and considered the evidence recorded at the trial or the

judgments of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Nor does the Committee have

engaged in any verification of the narrative provided to it by the 2nd Respondent. The

Committee seems to have been completely ignorant of the need to consider the views

of the family of the deceased victim. Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner

and the learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents submitted that

the observations of the Committee were contrary to the findings of the Court of

Appeal. That is factually correct.

410. Consequently, following a consideration of the reports of the Committee (including

the report pertaining to the 2nd Respondent), by letter dated 12th May 2016 addressed

to the 11A Respondent, the Minister has presented the said reports, and has

recommended that the President acting in terms of Article 34(1)(c) of the Constitution,

may be pleased to ‘commute’ the sentences of death imposed on the afore-stated 70

prisoners to life imprisonment. However, it is to be noted that on the face of the

material pertaining to the grant of the 1st pardon (commutation of sentence) to the

2nd Respondent, it is evident that the 6A Respondent – Minister of Justice has not

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 169 of 306

considered the Report of the learned judge who sentenced the 2nd Respondent to

death. Nor has he considered the report of the Attorney General (contained in his

letter dated 1st October 2014).

411. Following the recommendation of the 6A Respondent – Minister of Justice reaching

the 11A Respondent, by his minute dated 17th May 2016 (on the very same day the

documentation was submitted to him), acting purportedly under Article 34(1)(c) of the

Constitution, had ‘pardoned’ all seventy (70) prisoners who were on the death row, by

directing that their sentence be commuted to a sentence of life imprisonment.

412. According to material available in File No. PS/CSA/00/9/3/67 of the Presidential

Secretariat, on two previous occasions (i.e. on 11th December 2015 and 20th April 2016,

respectively) thirty (30) and eighty-three (83) prisoners sentenced to death had been

purportedly pardoned by the 11A Respondent by commuting their death sentence to

life imprisonment. Further, after the afore-stated purported pardon given to seventy

(70) prisoners, on 25th January 2017, another sixty (60) prisoners in the death row had

been purportedly pardoned and a term of life imprisonment substituted therefor.

413. Thus, it is seen that the 1st pardon received by the 2nd Respondent was not peculiar

to him, and was part-and-parcel of a scheme that was in place. The lawfulness or

otherwise of the procedure that had been followed is a different matter, which I shall

advert to later.

Second Presidential Pardon granted to the 2nd Respondent

414. As the 11A Respondent’s affidavit was not informative at all, the sequence of events

which culminated in the impugned pardon (2nd pardon) being granted to the 2nd

Respondent had to be gathered from the material contained in File No.

PS/LD/කපාදු/24-7/2017 maintained by the Presidential Secretariat. Counsel

representing all parties had access to the file, and were issued with copies thereof by

learned ASG. Even after examining the contents of the said file, learned President’s

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 170 of 306

Counsel for the 11A Respondent did not seek permission of this Court to file an

additional affidavit explaining in detail, the sequence of events and the reasons for

the grant of the 2nd purported pardon to the 2nd Respondent. It is a matter of regret

that the Honourable Attorney General did not deem it appropriate to tender affidavit

and documentary evidence explaining in detail the events that took place which

resulted in the grant of the impugned pardon. In order to gather information and

conclude on the circumstances under which the impugned 2nd purported pardon had

been granted, this Court had only the documents and entries contained in the afore-

mentioned file, which the Court itself decided to call for and examine in the interest

of justice.

415. Upon a consideration of the documents, minutes and entries contained in the afore-

stated file, it transpired that by handwritten letter dated 30th July 2017 (transmitted

via facsimile), the mother of the 2nd Respondent, Sandra Jayamaha has presented an

Appeal to the 11A Respondent, seeking an appointment, enabling her to meet with

His Excellency the President to explain ‘the suffering faced by her as a mother for the

last 12 years and to state related facts’. The letter indicates that her ‘suffering’ arising

out of the conviction and sentence of her son for having committed ‘murder’, which

she states was ‘not intentional’. This letter has been addressed to President Maithripala

Sirisena, to the ‘attention of’ one Mr. Erick Weerawardena. Another copy of the same

letter contains the endorsement ‘Reg. introduction by Mr. Preethi Warawitage’. Neither

the learned President’s Counsel for the 11A Respondent nor the learned ASG offered

any assistance to enable this Court to conclude who these two gentlemen are, or to

understand their possible relationship or involvement with either Mrs. Sandra

Jayamaha or former President Maithripala Sirisena. The file does not indicate whether

pursuant to the receipt of this letter, the 11A Respondent granted an appointment to

Mrs. Sandra Jayamaha or whether she received any other opportunity to make

representations to the President.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 171 of 306

416. The file also contains an undated, unsigned letter addressed to the President by

Member of Parliament (MP) Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero, which seems to have been

received by the office of the Private Secretary to the President on 7th February 2019.

The venerable Thero alleges in the letter that the imprisonment of the 2nd Respondent

was sequel to a ‘wrong judgment’ and has requested that the 2nd Respondent ‘be

granted full freedom’ and that doing so would be ‘justifiable and humane’. This letter

contains an endorsement by the 11A Respondent (the then President) requiring

Additional Secretary (Legal) to the President to discuss the matter with him. The 11A

Respondent, in his affidavit makes no reference to the receipt of this letter,

notwithstanding his own handwritten minute appearing on the letter. During the

hearing, all counsel agreed with each other that the afore-stated endorsement had

been made by the 11A Respondent. Furthermore, neither the 1st Respondent -

Attorney-General nor the 11A Respondent presented to Court any evidence indicative

of whether or not a meeting took place between the 11A Respondent and the

Additional Secretary (Legal). However, it appears from the file that, consequent to the

receipt of the letter from Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Additional Secretary

(Legal) Mrs. Lakshmi Jayawickrema had taken several steps with regard to this matter,

such as calling for a report regarding the prisoner (2nd Respondent) from the

Commissioner General of Prisons and writing a letter to the 1st Respondent (Attorney-

General). Thus, one can reasonably assume that she had been instructed by the 11A

Respondent to take certain action with regard to the request received by the 11A

Respondent pertaining to the 2nd Respondent.

417. By letter dated 11th June 2019, the Additional Secretary (Legal) drew the attention of

the 1st Respondent Attorney-General to the previous letter dated 14th July 2014, and

sought his assistance to obtain a copy of the letter sent by the Attorney-General to

the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 172 of 306

418. In the meantime, by letter dated 13th June 2019, Mr. Preethi Jayamaha and Mrs. Sandra

Jayamaha respectively the father and mother of the 2nd Respondent, reiterated their

request to the President to grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent. To that letter has

been attached proof of the purported educational qualifications acquired by the 2nd

Respondent while he remained imprisoned, a newspaper article said to have been

authored by a retired Justice which has been critical of the judicial proceedings held

against the 2nd Respondent, and letters purportedly by (i) the Bishop of the Southern

Province Reverend Raymond Wickremasinghe, (ii) Venerable Dr. Keradewela

Punnarathana Nayake Thero, (iii) Attorney-at-Law Mahesh Madawala, (iv) a person

with an illegible signature and no name, (v) the Nawa Jeewana Amadyapa Handa

Sevaya, (vi) Attorney-at-Law Nalani Kamalika Manatunga, (vii) Attorney-at-Law Nilruk

Ihalakathrige Kumudu Nanayakkara, and (viii) Venerable Balangoda Buddhagosha

Thero. The afore-stated letters make no specific reference to the 2nd Respondent. Nor

do they contain a request that the 2nd Respondent be granted a pardon. These letters

contain general references to the need to grant relief to young persons who have

been rehabilitated while being detained in prison and have highlighted the need to

permit such persons to reintegrate into society as free citizens and lead a productive

life.

419. During the hearing of this matter, Reverend Wickremasinghe and Venerable

Punnarathana Thero sought to intervene in the proceedings before this Court, and

through counsel Mr. Shamil J. Perera, PC, vehemently emphasized that they did not

make a recommendation to the President that the 2nd Respondent be granted a

presidential pardon. There is no evidence before this Court to conclude the

circumstances under which the mother and father of the 2nd Respondent obtained

these letters from their respective authors to be presented to the President in support

of their plea that a presidential pardon be granted to the 2nd Respondent.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 173 of 306

420. The file also contains a ‘petition’ purportedly to have been jointly settled by retired

Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Rohini Marasinghe and President’s Counsel Sarath

Kongahage, and signed by the 2nd Respondent, seeking a presidential pardon for the

2nd Respondent. The petition has been forwarded to the President purportedly by

retired Justice Rohini Marasinghe, by her letter to the President dated 19th July 2019.

The grounds on which the pardon has been sought are, (a) the denial of the appeal

presented by the 2nd Respondent against his conviction for having committed murder

and therefore the alleged miscarriage of justice that had occurred, and (b) the

exemplary life of the 2nd Respondent spent during the period of imprisonment and

the achievement of high educational qualifications while being imprisoned.

421. In response to the letter dated 11th June 2019, the Attorney-General by his letter dated

12th September 2019 addressed to the President, has expressed the view that a

consideration of whether it is appropriate to grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent

should be founded upon a consideration of the totality of the associated facts and

circumstances, including (i) the nature of the cruel and inhuman attack of the 2nd

Respondent towards the deceased, (ii) the age of the 2nd Respondent at the time of

the commission of the offence (19 years), and (iii) the conduct of the 2nd Respondent

both after the incident in issue and after having been convicted. It is to be noted that

the Attorney-General has not expressed a specific view on whether or not a

presidential pardon should be granted to the 2nd Respondent. Learned Additional

Solicitor General was unable to explain why the Attorney-General deemed it

appropriate to express a view on the matter without considering among others, the

report from the Judge who convicted the 2nd Respondent for having committed

murder. That requirement being a constitutional necessity, non-compliance by the

Attorney-General being the chief legal advisor of the state, causes considerable

concern to this Court.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 174 of 306

422. By memorandum dated 4th October 2019, the Additional Secretary (Legal) has

forwarded her views regarding the matter of the grant of a presidential pardon to the

President and to the Secretary to the President. She has inter alia observed the

following:

• The grant of the first pardon to the 2nd Respondent which resulted in the

commutation of the death sentence to one of life imprisonment had not been

carried out in terms of the requisite procedure, in that the High Court (sic) had

not presented a report to the President in terms of section 286(b) of the CCPA,

and the Attorney-General and the Minister of Justice have not expressed their

views upon a consideration of the said report of the Judge who condemned the

2nd Respondent to death.

• The Attorney-General has not expressed a clear view as to whether or not the

death sentence imposed on the 2nd Respondent should be carried out.

• Independent of the correctness or otherwise of the procedure followed, the

sentence of death imposed on the 2nd Respondent has been converted into life

imprisonment. Thus, the procedure to be followed hereinafter is the procedure

to be followed with regard to a person who has been sentenced to serve life

imprisonment.

• Having regard to the conduct of the 2nd Respondent following his conviction,

the President may consider the grant of a pardon to the 2nd Respondent subject

to conditions.

423. Thereafter, it appears from the correspondence in the file between the Presidential

Secretariat and the Commissioner General of Prisons, that consideration had been

given to whether the 2nd Respondent could be granted a ‘special state pardon’ which

according to the said correspondence, is given to groups of prisoners based on the

punishment imposed on them, the term of imprisonment already served, and their

conduct within the prison. Learned Additional Solicitor General in his submissions did

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 175 of 306

not make a specific reference to any provision of the Constitution or any other law,

which empowers the President to grant this category of pardons, save as provided by

Article 34(1).

424. On 29th October 2019, the Additional Secretary (Legal) has addressed a memorandum

to the Secretary to the President stating that by minute dated 15th October 2019, the

President had directed that the 2nd Respondent be granted a ‘special state pardon’.

She has explained that however, pardons according to the scheme relating to the

grant of ‘special state pardons’ were being contemplated by the prisons authorities

only for prisoners who have not been sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

Therefore, it would not be possible to grant a ‘special state pardon’ to the 2nd

Respondent. The President has the power to grant either a full pardon or a pardon

that is subject to lawful conditions. In view of the foregoing, the Additional Secretary

(Legal) has sought a suitable direction from the President.

425. It must be inferred that this memorandum had been presented by the Secretary to

the President to the 11A Respondent. Consequently, the 11A Respondent has made

an endorsement “the release is approved” and has signed below the endorsement.

Sequel thereto, by letter dated 4th November 2019, the Presidential Secretariat has

informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice that the President has given his

approval to the release of the 2nd Respondent, and has notified him to take necessary

action according to the procedure provided in the Constitution. The Secretary to the

Ministry of Justice has communicated this decision to the Commissioner General of

Presidential power to grant a Pardon

427. From very early periods of organized human civilization when monarchs reigned,

monarchs being the fountain of all plenary powers of the state and the source of

executive, legislative and judicial power, by themselves had exercised the power to, at

their own discretion, grant clemency (pardon) to persons convicted of having

committed crimes. During that period, the power to grant clemency was the

prerogative of the monarch, was exercised at his sole discretion, and the exercise of

the power was unquestionable. It was treated as a divine act of mercy. This power and

the associated mechanism are found to-date in both contemporary common and civil

law traditions. In Britain, it is recorded that the ‘Royal Prerogative of Mercy’ was

originally an inherent and unique sovereign prerogative power of the monarch,

exercised by the monarch in exceptional cases where in his opinion ‘injustice’ had

occurred to a person by the courts system (criminal justice system). The historical

background of the power of pardon is articulated by James P. Goodrich in the article

titled ‘Use and Abuse of the Power to Pardon’ [11 J. American Institute of Criminal Law

& Criminology 334 (May 1920 to February 1921)] in the following manner:

“The power to pardon is one of the oldest departments of governmental function.

It seemed to have been exercised by the chief of the tribe to soften the rigor of

tribal customs. Side by side with the harsh aspects of the written law appear the

king and other rulers exercising the right of pardon, not by any express

authorization contained in the law, but by common consent. The king ruling by

divine right, deriving his power from God, and not from the people, was superior

to and above the law and claimed and exercised the right to set it aside when the

ends of justice so required.

While the code of Hammurabi, with its long line of statutory crimes, is silent as to

the pardoning power and gives no such authority to the king, yet we know that it

was one of the kingly prerogatives, for Samsu Illuna, the son of the Great

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 177 of 306

Hammurabi, more than 2,200 years B.C., pardoned a runaway that had,

according to the law, forfeited his life in fleeing from his master.

The Mosaic law nowhere gives the kings or judges the right to pardon, yet, we

know that King David exercised the right. The cities of refuge were established as

places where those who innocently shed blood might escape the hands of the

avenger. The right of sanctuary was a merciful provision to free the individual

from the consequences of his unlawful act.

The Greeks, in Plato’s laws, made provision that the prisoner might, after

conviction of his crime and an exile of two or three years, be pardoned by a group

of citizens, twelve in number, and allowed to return.

During the republic and monarchy of Rome, the power to pardon was freely

exercised by the executive as it was by the early English, Scottish and Irish kings.

Before the granting of the great charter by King John, the kings granted pardons

and forgave offences against the law, and, ruling by divine right, not only claimed

the right to suspend the law as to individuals, but as to entire classes of

individuals. They also claimed that having the power to pardon after the offense,

they might grant a dispensation to violate the law with impunity. Controversies

arose between king and parliament over this clear abuse of power until finally

parliament passed a law abolishing this prerogative of the king, “as it hath been

assumed and exercised of late” and denied the pardoning power of the king in

the future, “unless parliament shall make provision for such power in the terms

of the statute.”

In the development of English law, it was often found necessary to abate the

cruelty of its criminal statutes through the exercise of royal clemency. …The

English courts generally held that the right to pardon was an ancient remnant of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 178 of 306

the kingly prerogatives; since not given to the king by the people, they could not

take it away.

While the bare legal right of the king to pardon is still recognized under the

English law, yet, it is only exercised under the advice of the prime minister.

However much King George may sympathize with the Mayor of Cork in his hunger

strike, and however greatly he may desire to order his release, yet he well says

“custom forbids,” he is but the symbol of the Empire and the real power to pardon

rests with the prime minister Lloyd George.”

428. Discussing the connection between the historical evolution of the writ of habeas

corpus (also called the ‘Great Writ of Liberty’) and the grant of pardons, Paul D.

Halliday, Professor of History at the University of Virginia, in his treatise titled ‘Habeas

Corpus: From England to Empire’ [Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,

Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England, 2010], has analyzed the power of

pardon at great length. An extract from that analysis is reproduced below:

“… While the natural subject performed the bond of allegiance only with his body,

the King could do more. We return then to miracles. For that is what the royal

power to create sanctuary or to grant pardon was: a miracle by which the normal

rules of law, which might inflict the ultimate pains on the subject’s body, were

suspended. This same power, analogized outward and taken up by the justices of

King’s Bench, gave habeas corpus its unusual force. An examination of sanctuary

and pardon suggests how this worked…

By a Royal charter, the king granted the franchise of sanctuary, a place marked

out for mercy. But resort to sanctuary required a penalty: permanent exile, either

by remaining for the rest of one’s life within the sanctuary, or by abjuring the

realm. Either way, resort to sanctuary – extralegal mercy – broke the ties of

allegiance between the subject and king…

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 179 of 306

The Reformation destroyed monastic sanctuaries, so it may be more than

coincidental that the period of the greatest use of royal pardons – the first two

decades of Elizabeth’s reign – occurred between the end of English monasticism

and the onset of the writ’s greatest period of development at century’s end.

Matthew Hale called pardon “dispensation with laws” or “an exemption from

government”, allowable because the king thereby excused offenders “against his

own suit”: in other words, felons, who were prosecuted in the king’s name.

Commentators viewed this use of the prerogative in miraculous terms. True, only

God could pardon the ultimate penalties of sin. But from God “derived to princes

[the power] to remit the penalty of the laws temporal.” Or as James Morice asked,

“What is more agreeing unto the high majesty of a king than with loving mercy

to temper the severity of justice”? When the king pardoned those attained of

treason, the king simultaneously restored the inheritance of the traitor’s heir.

…The king’s unique capacity to pardon – to breathe life again into the “dead

person in law” – was the same power by which anyone, even an alien, might

become a subject…By protecting his subjects – natural and otherwise – where law

warranted, and by granting mercy where law did not warrant, the king exercised

his prerogative. In both cases his body commanded theirs…

There was an important connection between pardons and habeas corpus in

practice as well as in conception. In the sixteenth century, the writ was one of the

means by which a pardon recipient might be brought into court to plead the

pardon. Most of these pardons pleaded on habeas corpus arose prior to

conviction…habeas may have provided the best means for being brought into

court to use a pardon prior to trial…”

429. In the article titled ‘The Problematic Presidential Pardon: A Proposal for reforming

Federal Clemency’ [(2009) 3 Harvard Law & Policy Review, 447], Jonathan Menitove

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 180 of 306

has provided the historical background to the power of pardon in the following

manner:

“…Rather than perceive it as a failsafe in the criminal justice system, the British

viewed the executive clemency as a power vested in the monarch in accordance

with his divine right to rule. Pardons were thought of personal gifts from the

monarch that required no justification and were not subject to criticism. Naturally,

monarchs began to abuse the pardon, employing this power for monetary and

political gain. …Upon colonizing the New World, the British Crown delegated

clemency power to the colonies’ royal Governors…”

430. In almost all countries which have retained the monarchical system of governance,

legislative mechanisms have been put in place by the respective legislatures which

stipulate the procedure to be followed, and on whose recommendation the monarch

should act. Thus, the exercise of this power is regulated. In most such countries, power

has been vested by statute in an officer holding high executive office mostly in the

justice sector, empowering him to recommend to the monarch, the grant of a pardon

in appropriate cases. Thus, the sovereign prerogative and unfettered discretionary

character of the power vested in the monarch to decide on the grant of the pardon

has now become virtually non-existent, with the monarch being required to act upon

the recommendation of an officer of the Executive.

431. In countries with republican Constitutions, the power to grant a pardon has been

vested in the Head of State. In countries where the Head of State is appointed or

exercises nominal executive power, he acts on the recommendation of the elected

Prime Minister or the Minister in-charge of law or law enforcement. In countries with

an Executive Presidency (such as in Sri Lanka), the power is vested directly in the

President. In almost all countries which are republics, the power to grant a pardon is

contained in the Constitution of the respective country. It is to be noted that, Article

34 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka confers on the President wide power to grant a

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 181 of 306

pardon, respite, substitute a less severe sentence, or remit the whole or any part of

the punishment imposed by a court of law on any person, all of which are different

manifestations of the exercise of power of pardon conferred on the President by the

Constitution. [Thus, in this judgment, unless where specifically required, I shall refer to

these various manifestations of the power of pardon as ‘pardon’ in general.] Further,

Article 154B(9) confers on a Governor of a Province limited power to grant a pardon,

which power he shall exercise on the advice of the Board of Ministers.

432. From country to country, the procedure to be followed by the Head of State when

considering the grant of a pardon varies. In some legal systems, no procedure has

been specified by written law.

433. The primary objective of criminal justice is the detection and investigation of crime,

identification and apprehension (arrest) of the perpetrator, prosecution of the

perpetrator (accused) of crime, and if found ‘guilty’ and the accused is convicted,

determination and imposition of punishment on the convict. A secondary objective of

criminal justice is the enforcement and management of penal sanctions imposed on

the convicted person by court. Particularly in the background of one ground on which

the grant of the pardon to the 2nd Respondent has been impugned, it is important to

note that another secondary objective of criminal justice is the delivery of ‘justice’ to

the victim of crime (which particularly in the case of deceased victims would include

members of the family of such deceased, such as the 9th and 10th Respondents), and

provide reparation to victims. Contemporary norms of the rule of law demand that,

the processes and measures of criminal justice are carried out strictly according to

law. This is crucial, as criminal justice measures such as arrest, remand, prosecution

and imprisonment, have a direct bearing on the liberty of the person who is subject

to such measures, and therefore would have a bearing on his fundamental rights.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 182 of 306

434. While the detection and investigation of crime and identification and apprehension

of perpetrator of crime, are components of executive power given effect to through

law enforcement, so is the institution of criminal proceedings against the accused and

his prosecution. The trial of the accused and determination of guilt or otherwise is the

function and responsibility of the judiciary. If found ‘guilty’, the determination of the

penal sanctions (sentence) to be imposed on the convicted accused and its imposition

is also part of judicial functions. However, the execution of such punishment and its

management rest once again on the executive arm of the state. Thus, alternatively,

the executive and the judicial arms of the state are vested with distinct duties of

enforcing different segments of the criminal justice process. It is fundamental that the

non-prosecution and non-punishment of perpetrators of crime is an affront to the

rule of law, and is not in public interest. Similarly, the prosecution or the punishment

of persons who are not responsible in terms of the law (legally culpable) for

committing offences, is also contrary to the rule of law and is ‘unjustified’ and

‘unlawful’ in the broad sense. The non-prosecution and non-punishment of offenders

(which if widespread and systematic would give rise to a climate of impunity) and the

prosecution and punishment of persons who are not responsible in terms of the law

for committing crimes, denote a failure of the criminal justice system, and can be

referred to as a situation which results in ‘injustice’. Their repercussions are serious

and far reaching. Should the executive arm of the state choose to arbitrarily not

enforce punishment imposed on persons convicted by the judiciary, it would be a

major afront to the functioning of the judiciary, impinge upon the administration of

justice, and would violate the rule of law.

435. Developed legal systems contain mechanisms for judicial review of executive action

taken inter alia in the sphere of law enforcement in the criminal justice process.

Similarly, legal systems contain judicial mechanisms which are aimed at appellate

consideration of decisions of trial courts. Further, invocation of the revisionary

jurisdiction is possible to correct illegality in judicial decision-making. These judicial

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 183 of 306

mechanisms are aimed at ensuring that objectives of criminal justice are achieved only

in terms of the law, and to prevent possible miscarriages of justice. In this backdrop,

it is important to note that, unless there are cogent and justiciable reasons, the grant

of a pardon to a person who has been convicted by a trial court and thereafter has

exhausted unsuccessfully his right to appeal against the conviction and the sentence

imposed by a competent court, should be viewed with the greatest possible

circumspection. That is the case at hand relating to the 2nd Respondent. This is

particularly due to the serious and far-reaching consequences arising out of the grant

of a pardon to a person correctly convicted for having committed an offence, as the

grant of a pardon under such circumstances has the potential of adversely affecting

the very fabric of the rule of law and social justice, and would defeat the objectives of

criminal justice.

Purposes of conferring on the President the power to grant a Pardon

436. During the hearing of the petition, on multiple occasions, the Court inquired from

learned counsel, the purpose for which the power to grant a pardon has been vested

in the monarch or on the Head of State, as the case may be. As the object and purpose

could vary from country to country, we invited counsel to focus on the situation in Sri

Lanka. All counsel agreed with each other that the Constitution was silent as to the

purpose for which the power to grant pardon has been vested in the President. There

is also no judicial precedent other than the recent pronouncement of the Supreme

Court in Hirunika Premachandra and Another vs. Honourable Attorney General

and Others [SC/FR 221, 225, and 228/2021, SC Minutes of 17th January 2023]

(hereinafter referred to in the name of the beneficiary of the impugned pardon, as the

‘Duminda Silva Pardon Case’), which provides any guidance in this regard. The benefit

of that judgment was not available to learned counsel when they argued this matter

and when they submitted post-argument written submissions.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 184 of 306

437. Although Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena, PC on behalf of the Petitioner did not express a

specific view regarding the possible purposes for which the power to grant a pardon

has been vested in the President and may be exercised, he submitted that the

President cannot exercise this extraordinary power in a manner that violates the rule

of law. He contended that the powers of the President are confined to the four corners

of the Constitution. He further submitted that the powers vested in the President must

be used only in furtherance of public good and not for an improper or personal

purpose.

438. Dr. Romesh de Silva, PC who appeared for the aggrieved 9th and 10th Respondents,

submitted that the exercise of the power of pardon is ‘limited to the proper exercise of

Executive power which is inextricably linked and circumscribed by the doctrine of public

trust’. The learned President’s Counsel submitted that it is not possible to enumerate

the varied circumstances under which the President may exercise the power of

pardon. In that regard, he submitted that (i) emergence of new evidence which was

not available at the time of the trial which points towards the innocence of the

convicted person, and (ii) the grant of a pardon which is necessary to achieve the

greater welfare of the nation (such as pardoning of prisoners in furtherance of

national, ethnic or religious reconciliation and permitting a terminally ill patient to

spend the remaining few days of his life at home) are purposes for which the power

of pardon may be exercised by the President. Therefore, it was his submission that

“the President cannot resort to Article 34(1), unless the doctrine of public trust

necessitates it”. Learned President’s Counsel vehemently rejected the proposition that

a purpose for which the power of pardon may be exercised by the President is to

rectify a ‘miscarriage of justice’. Learned President’s Counsel submitted that the

President lacks the authority to review a judgment of a court of law based on the

allegation that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. He submitted that the principle

of finality of judgments and orders delivered by court is an inherent aspect of the

administration of justice. Therefore, the judgment of any original court should be

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 185 of 306

considered and treated as binding and conclusive, with its authority superseded only

by the right to appeal, and with the judgment of the appellate court remaining

similarly final and conclusive. In the circumstances, the learned President’s Counsel

submitted that “it would therefore strike a note of irony if any individual, regardless of

their level of competence, were permitted to review and reconsider the judgment of a

Court.”

439. The position of Additional Solicitor General Mr. Nerin Pulle, PC was that the power

vested in the President to grant a pardon to a convict, exists as a safeguard against a

‘miscarriage of justice’ and is a ‘check on the exercise of the judicial power by the

judiciary’. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that it is not however,

the only purpose for which the power of pardon may be exercised. He submitted that

there may be a number of other grounds on which a pardon may be granted, “as long

as there is no obvious or gross unlawfulness, such as in the case of a pardon granted in

return for a bribe”. Citing certain foreign judicial authorities (which I shall advert to

later), learned Additional Solicitor General sought to demonstrate that purposes of

granting a pardon may include (i) the reduction of an excessive sentence, (ii) situations

where in the opinion of the President, the grant of a pardon to a convict would benefit

the public, and (iii) situations which necessitate curing a miscarriage of justice that has

occurred due to possible fallibility of human judgment. Learned Additional Solicitor

General agreed with the submission made by learned President’s Counsel for the 9th

and 10th Respondents that the purposes of granting a pardon cannot be laid down in

an exhaustive list. Thus, he submitted that “in recognizing the broad range of situations

wherein the power of pardon may be exercised, the framers of the Constitution have

refrained from stipulating any particular set of circumstances in which the President

may exercise the power of pardon”.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 186 of 306

440. Mr. Faizer Mustapha, PC who appeared for the 11A Respondent (former President)

did not venture to explain the purposes for which the power of pardon in terms of

Article 34(1) may be exercised by the President. Instead, learned President’s Counsel

pointed out that “the exercise of the power of pardon has been freely and with the

widest discretion been exercised time and time again, both in the case of routine mass

pardons and individual pardoning by the predecessors and successors of the office of

the President of the Republic …”. Particularly since learned President’s Counsel

represented the former President who had granted both pardons referred to in this

judgment, Court expected learned counsel to explain the purpose for which his client

had exercised power vested in him by Article 34 of the Constitution. However, his

views on the matter were not conspicuous.

441. In the Duminda Silva Pardon Case, the purpose of vesting in the President the power

to grant a pardon has not been directly discussed. However, Justice Surasena

delivering the unanimous judgment of this Court, citing from the advice sent in that

case by the Attorney-General to the Minister of Justice, has expressed the view that

the President must have reasons for the grant of a pardon, which must be capable of

being assessed objectively and those grounds should be capable of withstanding the

“test of rationality, reasonableness, intelligible and objective criteria”.

442. On a consideration of the nature of the power vested in the President by Article

34 of the Constitution, its impact on the rule of law, its potential under certain

circumstances to defeat the objects and purposes of criminal justice, and its

possible consequence of negating the impact of the exercise of judicial power

which is exercised by courts and tribunals on behalf of the people, it is my

considered view that, it is not possible to stipulate exhaustively the purposes for

which the Constitution has vested the unique and extraordinary power in the

President to grant a pardon. However, it is manifest that the power to grant a

pardon is extraordinary in nature, and may be exercised by the President (a) in

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 187 of 306

terms of the law, (b) in exceptional situations, (c) on an objective consideration

of relevant facts and in good faith, and (d) to serve the interests of the public,

and for no other reason.

443. In my view, one possible instance which would justify the exercise of the power to

grant a pardon, since it would necessarily be in public interest, would be to redress a

proven instance of a miscarriage of justice. Where an allegation of a miscarriage of

justice has been made, the President must, following objective scrutiny, satisfy himself

that such allegation is substantiated based on incontrovertible cogent evidence

(which had surfaced after the final appeal had been dispensed with and thereby all

judicial remedies had been exhausted), and it is established to the satisfaction of the

objective mind of the President that in fact, a miscarriage of justice had occurred. The

responsibility of examining such an allegation that a miscarriage of justice had

occurred, must be appropriately conferred on a Commission of Inquiry appointed by

the President in terms of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, No. 17 of 1948 (as amended)

and following investigation and inquiry by such Commission, and the receipt of its

Report, the President can decide on whether or not to grant the requested pardon

founded upon a consideration of the findings of such Commission of Inquiry.

444. This court wishes to highlight three other possible instances which may justify the

grant of a pardon. They are, (i) the grant of a pardon (a) to a terminally ill or extremely

old convict awaiting the execution of the death sentence, with only a small period of

life left, or (b) on other humanitarian considerations, (ii) the grant of a pardon to a

foreign national who has been convicted for committing a non-serious offence such

as the offence of unauthorized entry into the territorial waters of Sri Lanka for fishing,

whose pardon is granted in furtherance of advancing or strengthening Sri Lanka’s

international relations particularly with the state of which the convict is a national, and

(iii) the grant of a pardon to a convict in furtherance of the policy of the state to

achieve ethno-social, religious or political reconciliation.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 188 of 306

445. This Court will not venture to list out other possible instances where the grant of a

pardon may be in public interest, as the list is unlikely to be exhaustive. It is necessary

to highlight that in all these instances where the grant of a pardon is permissible,

what is sought to be achieved is public interest and public good (as the public is

collectively the sovereign of the republic), and not the grant of a benefit to the

recipient of the pardon, though that is also an inevitable outcome. It is also

necessary to observe that, ‘public interest’ should not be a ground to be used

only to ‘justify’ an impugned decision to grant a pardon, in situations where the

decision to grant the pardon had been taken due to an extraneous or collateral

reason. Nor can it be an after-thought crafted by the decision-maker or his

competent counsel, to justify the impugned decision. The decision-maker being

the President, should have formed the view objectively, on an application of

rational and intelligible criteria, which should be manifest to court as being

reasonable with a rational and conclusive nexus of serving the interests of the

public, particularly when compared with the objectives of criminal justice.

Reasons for the decision which should reflect the opinion of the President and

of nobody else, contemporaneously documented alongside the decision of the

President, should reveal the justification for the decision to grant the pardon.

Such reasons must be presented to Court when the decision to grant or refusal

to grant a pardon is impugned before a competent court.

446. It is of paramount importance to note that the power to grant a pardon should not

be viewed or exercised as if it is a frill which comes with the presidency to be exercised

at the whims and fancies of the President or as an act that would confer spiritual merit

or divine blessings on the decision-maker. As held in several judgments of this Court,

every power that is vested in a public authority must be exercised for the purposes

for which they have been conferred, and in public interest. [De Silva v Atukorale,

Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another (1993) 1

Sri L R 283, Sugathapala Mendis and Another v Chandrika Kumaratunga and

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 189 of 306

Others (2008) 2 Sri L R 339, Jayawardena v Dharani Wijayatilake, Secretary,

Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Others (2001) 1 Sri L R 132]. In

Heather Therese Mundy v Central Environmental Authority [SC Appeal 58/2003,

SC Minutes of 20.01.2004], Justice Mark Fernando has held the view that “powers

vested in public authorities are not absolute or unfettered, but are held in trust for the

public to be exercised for the purposes for which they have been conferred” and that

“their exercise is subject to judicial review by reference to those purposes”. Therefore,

power conferred on public functionaries should not be exercised as a means of

achieving collateral financial, political or other benefit. Power must be exercised in

good faith with due diligence, and to achieve the purpose for which that power has

been vested. Therefore, in contemporary Constitutional and Publica law of this

country, the grant of a Pardon by the President acting under Article 34 of the

Constitution is not an act of clemency or mercy.

447. The use of the power to grant pardon to a convict for any extraneous purpose which

is not in public interest, would amount to an abuse of the power, and an act which

violates public trust vested in the Presidency. Thus, exercise of the power to grant a

pardon under such circumstances would be unlawful, as it would amount to an abuse

of power. It is necessary to point out that given the circumstances under which the

power was exercised, the exercise of the power to grant a pardon for a purpose that

is not in public interest may amount to an intentional violation of the Constitution by

the President and or an act of corruption. In all such situations where the power to

grant a pardon has not been exercised in public interest and amounts to an abuse of

power, if impugned through judicial proceedings and the claim is proven, this Court

is duty-bound to make an appropriate pronouncement quashing the pardon and

where appropriate proceed to ensure that appropriate sanctions flow.

Procedural requirements pertaining to the exercise of the power to grant a

Pardon

448. Article 34 of the Constitution provides as follows:

(1) The President may in the case of any offender convicted of any offence in any

court within the Republic of Sri Lanka –

(a) grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions;

(b) grant any respite, either indefinite for such period as the President may

think fit, of the execution of any sentence passed on such offender;

(c) substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment

imposed on such offender; or

(d) remit the whole or any part of any punishment imposed or of any

penalty or forfeiture otherwise due to the Republic on account of such

offence:

Provided that where any offender shall have been condemned to suffer

death by the sentence of any court, the President shall cause a report to be

made to him by the Judge who tried the case and shall forward such report to the

Attorney-General with instructions that after the Attorney-General has advised

thereon, the report shall be sent together with the Attorney-General’s advice to

the Minister in charge of the subject of Justice, who shall forward the report with

his recommendation to the President.

(2) The President may in the case of any person who is or has become subject to

any disqualification specified in paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of Article 89 or

sub-paragraph (g) of Paragraph (1) of Article 91 –

(a) grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions; or

(b) reduce the period of such disqualification.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 191 of 306

(3) When any offence has been committed for which the offender may be tried

within the Republic of Sri Lanka, the President may grant a pardon to any

accomplice in such offence who shall give such information as shall lead to the

conviction of the principal offender or of any one of such principal offenders, if

more than one.

[Emphasis added.]

449. It is the proviso to Article 34(1) which explicitly stipulates the procedure to be followed

when exercising the power conferred on the President relating to a person who has

been condemned to suffer death by the sentence of any court. The Constitution is

silent as to the procedure to be followed with regard to other instances where the

person concerned has not been condemned to suffer death by a sentence of a court,

but has been imposed any other sentence, such as life imprisonment or any other

term of imprisonment. Whether the applicable common law fills that lacuna, and

therefore the unwritten law requires the President to even in such other cases follow

a particular procedure which is in conformity with the rules of natural justice, is not a

matter this Court needs to adjudicate upon in this case, as there was virtual consensus

among learned counsel, that the case being considered does come within the purview

of the proviso contained in Article 34(1). That is because, as set-out in detail in the

introductory part of this judgment, the Court of Appeal sentenced the 2nd Respondent

– Don Shramantha Jude Jayamaha to death, which judicial pronouncement was not

subsequently set-aside by any other competent court. Thus, for all purposes, as at the

time of the consideration of the grant of both the 1st and 2nd purported impugned

pardons, the 2nd Respondent was a person who had been condemned to suffer death

by a sentence of a ‘court’. In this regard, it is necessary to note that, even if the 1st

pardon referred to in this judgment is deemed not to be unlawful, the 1st pardon did

not have the effect of setting aside the conviction for murder imposed by the Court

of Appeal and the sentence of death imposed on the 2nd Respondent. Thus, as at the

time the 11A Respondent considered the grant of the pardon which in effect removed

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 192 of 306

the term of life imprisonment imposed as a result of the 1st purported pardon, the 2nd

Respondent remained to be a person who had been condemned to death. Thus, the

procedure set-out in the proviso to Article 34(1) was applicable even with regard to

the impugned 2nd pardon.

450. The procedure the President is required to follow (as contained in the proviso to

Article 34(1) in cases where the person whose sentence is under consideration for the

grant of a pardon, contains a sequential step-by step-approach. A consideration of

the proviso to Article 34(1) reveals unequivocally that it contains procedure to be

followed by the President, the Attorney-General and the Minister in-charge of the

subject of Justice. Such procedure is set out below:

1. The President shall cause a report to be made to him by the Judge who tried

the case.

2. The President shall forward such report to the Attorney-General. The

communication to the Attorney-General shall contain instructions, that after

the Attorney-General has advised thereon, the report of the Judge shall be

sent together with the Attorney-General’s advice to the Minister in-charge

of the subject of Justice.

3. On the receipt of the afore-stated communication from the President, upon

a consideration of the report of the Judge and other relevant material which

the Attorney-General may be briefed of such as a report of the State Counsel

who conducted the prosecution against the convict (though a consideration

of such additional material is not a requirement contained in the proviso to

Article 34(1), thus not a mandatory requirement), the Attorney-General shall

record his advice on the matter, and forward the report of the Judge

(together with his advice) to the Minister in-charge of the subject of Justice.

4. Upon receipt of the material submitted by the Attorney-General, the

Minister in-charge of the subject of Justice shall on a consideration of such

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 193 of 306

material and any other material which the Minister may deem to be relevant

(which is also not a mandatory requirement), forward to the President his

recommendation. It is to be reasonably assumed that to the Minister’s

communication to the President would be attached, the opinion expressed

by the Attorney-General.

451. It is necessary to note that, what is meant by the term ‘a report to be made to him by

the Judge who tried the case’ is the report of the Judge who pronounced the sentence

of death on the accused - convict. In the circumstances of this case, that would be a

reference to the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal of

the Attorney-General, found the convicted accused – respondent ‘guilty’ of having

committed the offence of ‘murder’ and accordingly sentenced him to ‘death’.

452. A perusal of the material called for from the Presidential Secretariat and examined by

court pertaining to the grant of the 1st and 2nd purported pardons as well as the

evidence placed before this Court by all parties, reveal clearly the absence of such a

report having been called for and examined by the 11A Respondent President

Maithripala Sirisena and the 1st Respondent Attorney-General. The 11A Respondent

in his affidavit to this Court does not even claim to have complied with the first step

in the procedure stipulated in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution when he

was called upon to consider the grant of the 2nd purported pardon. Thus, procedural

irregularity stems from the very beginning of both purported pardons.

453. As regards the 2nd Respondent - Attorney-General, on the occasion relating to the

grant of the 1st purported pardon, he has not been actuated by the receipt of a

communication from the President, which should have contained the report of the

Judge who sentenced the 2nd Respondent to ‘death’. On the first occasion, though by

letter dated 14th July 2014, the Presidential Secretariat sought the opinion of the

Attorney-General, a report by the Judge who sentenced the 2nd Respondent to death

was not submitted. Nor did the Attorney-General separately receive and consider the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 194 of 306

report of the relevant Judge. The material available does not in any way disclose that

the Attorney-General considered the report of the relevant Judge. Furthermore,

instead of his opinion on the matter being communicated to the Minister of Justice,

he has forwarded his opinion (which did not contain a recommendation that the 2nd

Respondent be granted a presidential pardon) to the President, and copied such

communication to the Minister of Justice. Thereafter, the matter of the 1st purported

pardon seems to have remained in abeyance till the change of the Presidency in

January 2015 from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to former President

Maithripala Sirisena.

454. In May 2016, the Minister of Justice acting upon a report of a ‘Review Committee’ (the

appointment of which is not referable to a specific statutory provision which learned

ASG could successfully cite before this Court) recommended to the President the

grant of a presidential pardon to seventy (70) inmates who were in the ‘death row’

awaiting their execution, which included the 2nd Respondent. It is on the strength of

the report of the said Committee and the general recommendation of the Minister of

Justice contained in his letter to the President dated 12th May 2015, that the 11A

Respondent – then President Maithripala Sirisena had on 17th May 2016, decided to

grant pardon to all seventy (70) convicts on the ‘death row’ in respect of whom the

Minister of Justice had made recommendations, which included the 2nd Respondent.

455. On the occasion of the grant of the 2nd purported pardon, the documents filed of

record in the corresponding file maintained by the Presidential Secretariat and its

minutes reveal that the process which culminated in the grant of the 2nd purported

pardon commenced upon the 11A Respondent receiving a letter of request dated 30th

July 2017 from the mother of the 2nd Respondent, seeking a pardon for her son. A

perusal of the documents and minutes of the file does not indicate any action having

been taken with regard to the said letter till 19th February 2019, when the 11A

Respondent (then President) received an unsigned letter in support of the plea to

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 195 of 306

grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent. That plea had been submitted by Ven.

Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Member of Parliament. As set-out above, it appears that

following the appeal by the venerable monk, the 11A Respondent received another

appeal by the mother and father of the 2nd Respondent supported by several letters

to which reference has been made earlier in this judgment. Further, the 2nd

Respondent himself appears to have presented an appeal to the President. It is

thereafter that the Presidential Secretariat once again wrote to the Attorney-General,

the Attorney-General expressed an opinion on the matter, and the Additional

Secretary (Legal) to the President also made certain observations. Thereafter, on 29th

October 2019, the 11A Respondent decided that the 2nd Respondent should be ‘set

free’.

456. Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC who appeared for the 9th and 10th Respondents, laid heavy

emphasis on the fact that the powers of the President to grant a pardon have been

circumscribed by and are conditional upon strict adherence to Article 34 of the

Constitution, and given the facts and circumstances of this matter, compliance with

the proviso contained in Article 34(1) was absolutely necessary. Both Dr. De Silva and

Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena, PC pointed out that, in both instances which resulted in

the grant of purported pardons to the 2nd Respondent, the 11A Respondent had

grievously breached the procedure contained in the said proviso. Both learned

President’s Counsel submitted that in the circumstances, both purported presidential

pardons were in violation of Article 34(1) of the Constitution, and thus amounted to

an infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and the fundamental

rights of the 9th and 10th Respondents recognized by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

457. Further, Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC pointed out that section 3(q) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime Act, No. 4 of 2015 (recently repealed and substituted

by Act No. 10 of 2023) provides that ‘in the event of any person in authority considering

the grant of a pardon or remission of sentence imposed on any person convicted of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 196 of 306

having committed an offence, to receive notice thereof and submit through the

Authority (the National Authority for the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses) to the person granting such pardon or remission, the manner in

which the offence committed had impacted on his life including his body, state of mind,

employment, profession or occupation, income, quality of life, property and any other

aspects concerning his life.’ In the circumstances, he submitted that a victim of crime

[which in the given circumstances of this case would include both the 9th and 10th

Respondents (the father and sister of the deceased, respectively) and mother of the

deceased] were entitled to be informed of the fact that consideration was being given

to the grant of a pardon to the convict (2nd Respondent), enabling such victims of

crime to present to the authority considering the grant of the pardon (through the

National Authority) their views on the matter. Dr. De Silva complained that the 11A

Respondent had failed to comply with the said mandatory requirement and hence the

right of his clients recognized by section 3(q) of the Act had been infringed by the

11A Respondent making the decision to grant the pardon in breach of the

fundamental right of the 9th and 10th Respondents recognized by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

458. For the reasons enumerated above, it would thus be seen that, the grant of both the

first and the second purported pardons were procedurally flawed, and thus

ultra-vires and therefore unlawful and void on that ground alone. In fact, learned

ASG, submitted that he agreed with learned counsel for the Petitioner and the 9th and

10th Respondents that the procedure followed on both occasions was contrary to the

procedure laid down in the proviso to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution.

459. In any other case of judicial review which takes the form of a fundamental rights

Application where an infringement of Article 12(1) has been challenged, judicial

scrutiny of the procedure followed on the impugned occasion and the identification

of the procedural impropriety or irregularity which culminated in the impugned

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 197 of 306

decision being taken, would be sufficient, for a determination of the unlawfulness of

the impugned decision, and thus a declaration being made of an infringement of

Article 12(1).

460. However, in this matter, there is a need to proceed further, particularly due to a

particular submission vehemently advanced by the learned ASG. That matter is

discussed in the next part of this judgment.

Judicial Reviewability of the decision of the President to grant a Pardon

461. In view of the emphasis made by the learned Additional Solicitor General with regard

to the scope of reviewability of a decision by the President to grant a pardon to a

person convicted of committing an offence, it is necessary to refer to and deal with

submissions made by learned counsel in that regard in some detail.

462. Submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor General - The essence of the

submissions of learned Additional Solicitor General made in this regard was that,

though the exercise of power by the President under and in terms of Article 34(1) of

the Constitution may be subject to judicial review through the exercise of the

fundamental rights jurisdiction vested in this Court by Article 126 of the Constitution,

such review is limited to a consideration of procedural vires of the impugned decision,

as opposed to review on grounds of substantive vires. In other words, the position

advanced by learned ASG was that, when reviewing the impugned decision to grant

a pardon to the 2nd Respondent by the 11A Respondent, this Court may consider only

whether the then President had acted in terms of the procedure laid down in the

proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution, and should refrain from going into the

merits of the decision. Learned ASG proceeded to elaborate his core argument made

in this regard based on the following specific grounds:

1. limits on the judicial reviewability of the exercise of the power of pardon in other

jurisdictions;

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 198 of 306

2. the scope of judicial review of the exercise of power by President in Sri Lanka;

3. the doctrine of separation of powers supported by checks and balances

contained in the Constitution;

4. the power of pardon vested in the President being a ‘sui generis’ power.

463. Citing judicial authorities from other jurisdictions, learned ASG submitted that courts

have refrained from exercising their jurisdiction to curtail the power of pardon, and

has exercised judicial review only in very limited circumstances. He further contended

that the reviewability of the exercise of power by the President (not limited to the

power to grant a pardon) must be determined on a case-by case basis depending on

the nature of the power, nature of the act and the facts of the case. In this regard,

learned ASG cited the case of R. Sampanthan v AG, in which it was held that ‘…some

of the powers vested in the President by Article 33(2) may not, in practice, be reviewable

by an application under Article 126 depending on the facts before court…’.

464. Learned ASG also submitted that the review of the power to grant a pardon on the

merits of the decision violates the principle of ‘separation of powers’, in that, it allows

this Court, instead of the President to take decisions regarding who should be granted

a pardon and under what circumstances. He submitted that doing so would fail the

‘delegation test’ and would also constitute a ‘transfer, relinquishment or removal’ of a

power attributed to the President, to another organ of the state (that being the

judiciary). He submitted that ‘it would allow the Supreme Court instead of the President

to take decisions regarding who would be given a pardon. As such, the review of the

exercise of the power of pardon granted to the President by the Supreme Court would

violate Article 4 read with 3 of the Constitution’.

465. Learned ASG further submitted that when considering the unique nature of the power

of pardon, it is Parliament that is best suited to carry-out a ‘check’ on the President,

as the power of pardon is not a ‘check’ against Parliament, but a ‘check’ against the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 199 of 306

judiciary. He said that precluding judicial review on the merits of a decision to grant a

pardon does not result in the President being given an unfettered discretion.

466. Further, the learned ASG submitted that the power of pardon is ‘sui generis’ (stand-

alone) in nature. It was his contention that, the President’s power of pardon is

provided for separately in Article 34, from the ‘powers and functions of the President’

which are contained in Article 33, with the intention that the power to grant a pardon

is considered separately and be treated as a unique power, in the structure of the

Constitution, In the circumstances, he submitted that the power of pardon should be

recognized by this Court as a ‘sui generis’ power, and thus in the exercise of the

fundamental rights jurisdiction the power to grant a pardon should not be made

amenable to judicial review on the merits of the decision. He further submitted that

as the power of the President to grant a pardon under Article 34(1) is sui generis in

nature, judicial review of the exercise of such power would violate the doctrine of

separation of powers, including but not limited to the principle of checks and balances

contained in the Constitution. He submitted that ‘Article 34 of the Constitution which

allows the President to grant a pardon is part of the mechanism of checks and balances

in the Constitution. … this power allows for the President to act as a check upon the

decisions of the judiciary where necessary, in recognition of the fallibility of the judiciary’.

467. Mr. Pulle prefaced his submissions by making a generic assertion that the Executive

and the Judiciary are ‘two co-ordinate organs of government, each superior in their

spheres as equal elements of the sovereignty of the People’. He submitted that, if

evidence showed that the President when granting the impugned pardon had acted

in terms of the proviso to Article 34(1), then this Court should not review the granting

of the pardon on the merits. He asserted that there are matters which are not

amenable to judicial review, and referred to judicial precedent of certain other

jurisdictions in which the prerogative of mercy, from which the power of pardon

stems, has been placed in such category. Learned ASG cited the following passage

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 200 of 306

from the judgment of this Court in Premachandra v. Major Montague

Jayawickrema [(1994) 2 Sri L.R. 90 at page 110]:

“However, there are matters which undoubtedly do not involve legal and

constitutional rights, powers and duties, and which may therefore be regarded as

purely “political”. Mr. Seneviratne referred to Council of Civil Service Unions vs.

Minister of Civil Services.

Prerogative powers such as those relating to the making of treatise, the defences

of the realm, the prerogative of mercy, the grant of honours, the dissolution of

parliament and the appointment of ministers as well as others are not, I think

susceptible to judicial review because their nature and subject-matter are such as

not be amenable to the judicial process. As observed in that case, the controlling

factor is not the source of the power but its subject matter”.

468. Further, citing several Indian and South African judgments, the learned ASG submitted

that it is evident that in those jurisdictions, courts have exercised their jurisdiction only

in limited circumstances. The courts in those jurisdictions have refrained from

curtailing the power of the Executive to grant a pardon and have refrained from laying

down a general rule as to the exercise of the said power.

469. Citing Wijesinghe v. Attorney-General and Others [(1978-79-80) 1 Sri L.R. 102],

learned ASG submitted that not every wrong decision or breach of the law amounts

to a violation of a fundamental right and the entitlement to the reliefs available under

Article 126 of the Constitution. He further submitted that in these circumstances, in

the absence of any intentional or purposeful discrimination evident from the record,

this Court should be cautious in exercising the power of judicial review over the grant

of a pardon by the President. Referring to the judgment of the Divisional Bench of this

Court in Rajavarothiam Sampanthan v. Attorney-General (SC/FR 351/2018, SC

Minutes of 13.12.2018), the ASG submitted that ‘this judgment has not closed the door

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 201 of 306

on the matter of reviewability of the exercise of powers by the President and has instead

admitted the possibility that certain acts of the President may not be subject to judicial

review’.

470. Concluding his submissions on this aspect of the case, the learned ASG submitted that

reviewability of the President’s acts (exercise of power) must be determined on a case-

by-case basis depending on the nature of the power, nature of the act, and the facts

of the case. He submitted that there is no general rule that all of the President’s actions

are executive or administrative and that the exercise of all of his powers is reviewable.

471. Submissions of President’s Counsel for the Petitioner - In response, Mr. Sanjeewa

Jayawardena, PC for the Petitioner submitted that, the power of the President

exercisable under Article 34 of the Constitution is reviewable, not only on the grounds

of procedural vires, but also on the grounds of substantive vires, such as irrationality

and Wednesbury unreasonableness.

472. Citing a passage from A.V. Dicey on “Introduction to the study of the Law of the

Constitution” and certain general principles of Administrative Law, learned President’s

Counsel submitted that, no man whatever be his rank or condition is above the law

and thus, all public functionaries are subject to the ordinary law of the land. The

absolute supremacy or predominance of the regular law as opposed to the influence

of arbitrary power, excludes the existence of arbitrariness of prerogative or even wide

discretionary authority on the part of the government. Learned President’s Counsel

submitted that the submission of the learned ASG was “not only utterly ludicrous, but

also contrary to the basic tenets of doctrine of Rule of Law”.

473. He further submitted that, there are clear collateral motives and extraneous

considerations accentuating the action of the 11A Respondent, and the instance of

exercise of power in the impugned situation is tainted with mala fides and improper

intent. He submitted that the former President’s conduct gives rise to the violation of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 202 of 306

the right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

474. Submissions of the President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents - Dr.

Romesh De Silva, PC submitted that judicial review of an act of the President is not

confined to review of procedural impropriety. He emphasized that the same standard

of judicial review which is applicable to other matters are applicable to the acts done

by the President. These he submitted include inter-alia principles of ultra vires,

unreasonableness, arbitrariness, lack of bona-fides, proportionality, rules of natural

justice, and legitimate expectations.

Views of the Court and Conclusions reached regarding the question of

reviewability and justiciability of the President’s decision to grant a Pardon

475. The Constitution and associated doctrines founded upon which the Constitution has

been drafted, such as (a) the rule of law, (b) the doctrine of the separation of powers,

and (c) checks and balances placed in the Constitution to confer a balance in the

exercise of executive, legislative and judicial powers and prevent any infringement of

the Constitution and the abuse of power, reflect the conferment of co-equal status to

the executive, legislative and judicial organs of the state. That is to facilitate the proper

and lawful discharge of functions and the exercise of powers on behalf of the People

who are collectively the sovereigns of the Republic. The respective constitutional

obligations and mandates of the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary are to be

discharged for the purpose of giving effect to the executive, legislative and judicial

components of the People’s sovereignty in the manner provided by the Constitution.

These three organs of the state are required by the Constitution to discharge their

constitutional duties in terms of the law, independently of each other, and as provided

for and circumscribed by the Constitution.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 203 of 306

476. Therefore, I am acutely conscious that, should the Judiciary abstain from or fail to

discharge any part of its constitutional duties of exercising judicial power and confer

on the Executive, any status that is not consonant with the Constitution, it would be

unconstitutional. Furthermore, if the Judiciary through self-imposed restraint provide

an opportunity to the Executive to rise above the law and act in violation of the rule

of law, such self-restraint would by itself be a breach of the trust vested in the judiciary

by the Public through the Constitution. That would amount to a violation of the Public

Trust doctrine by the Judiciary. In this regard it must be recognized that the Judiciary

through its power of judicial adjudication has been conferred by the Constitution the

responsibility of ensuring that all three organs of the state (including the judiciary

itself) adheres to the Constitution and respects and abides by the rule of law.

Reviewability and Justiciability

477. Judicial review is the means by which a court of law engages in scrutiny of an

impugned decision, for the purpose of determining whether the impugned decision

is lawful. What is sought to be impugned may be a decision per-se, refusal to arrive at

a decision, conduct arising out of a decision, or the intentional failure to take a

particular course of action which is also referable to a corresponding decision to that

effect. Thus, judicial review is a judicial procedure adopted by a court vested with

jurisdiction to cause judicial review, to determine the legality of an impugned decision.

In R (Keyu) and Others v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth

Affairs and Another [(2015) UKSC 69] Lord Neuberger held that “There is no more

fundamental aspect of the rule of law than that of judicial review of executive decisions

or actions”.

478. Judicial review is carried out by a consideration of the (a) law that empowers a decision

to be taken, (b) the decision-making process followed by the decision-maker, and (c)

the facts and circumstances considered by the decision-maker and other relevant

factual considerations, pertaining to the impugned decision. Judicial review is carried

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 204 of 306

out by applying legal standards and criteria, and nothing else. Judicial review is a

means by which a court engages in determining the legality of the impugned decision.

Judicial review audits the manner in which a decision has been arrived at. Unlike in an

Appeal, the court engaged in judicial review is not concerned about the correctness

of the impugned decision, but its lawfulness. In the case of Council of Civil Service

Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (referred to popularly as the ‘GCHQ case’),

Lord Roskill citing precedent observed that “judicial review is not an appeal from a

decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made.”

479. Judicial review results in a pronouncement being made by court in the form of a

declaration regarding the lawfulness or otherwise of the impugned decision. In

appropriate situations, in addition to such declaration, relief would also be granted.

Often, such relief takes the form of quashing of the decision found to have been

unlawful. Whether or not further relief should be granted is determined by a different

set of principles. The principles used to determine the lawfulness or otherwise of an

impugned decision is distinct from the criteria used to determine whether specific

substantive relief should be granted. Nevertheless, they are inter-related.

480. Judicial review facilitates the maintenance of the state and the society in terms of the

rule of law, and ensures that public affairs are conducted in accordance with the rule

of law. In R (Evans) and Another v. Attorney General [(2015) UKSC 21] Lord

Neuberger held that “… it is fundamental to the rule of law that decisions and actions

of the executive are, subject to necessary well-established exceptions (such as

declarations of war), are jealously scrutinized”. In AXA General Insurance Ltd and

Others v. The Lord Advocate and Others [(2011) UKSC 46] Lord Reed held that

“Judicial review under the common law is based upon an understanding of the

respective constitutional responsibilities of public authorities and the courts. The

constitutional function of the courts in the field of public law is to ensure, so far as they

can, that public authorities respect the rule of law. The courts therefore have the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 205 of 306

responsibility of ensuring that the public authority in question does not misuse its

powers or exceeds their limits” Thus, it would be seen that, broadly, judicial review

advances public interest by protecting the rule of law and seeks to protect the citizenry

from possible abuse of power by public authorities.

481. It is difficult, if not impossible to define the scope of judicial review, save as to very

broadly stating that, generally, decisions of public nature, taken or purported to have

been taken under the law, which have an impact on legal interests of persons are

amenable to judicial review. Further, as seen in judicial precedent, it is not every such

public decision that is reviewable. Whether or not a particular decision is reviewable,

is determined, founded upon the grounds of judicial review.

482. A detailed consideration of judicial precedent (particularly of the United Kingdom,

where contemporary Administrative Law was born, has grown and remains in a

process of evolution) shows that the outer boundaries of reviewability are rather ill-

defined, in-conclusive, rather murky, and hence not clearly discernible. Furthermore,

direct incorporation of the present status and the boundaries of judicial review as

contained in the judgments of superior courts of the United Kingdom into the law of

Sri Lanka may not be possible and may be wholly inappropriate in certain

circumstances. This is due to certain significant differences between the two

Constitutional arrangements, corresponding legal systems, and jurisdictions vested in

court.

483. These differences stem from the republican character of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka, sovereignty being vested in the People, the inalienable nature

of the sovereignty of the People, the manner in which the Constitution dictates that

the sovereignty of the People be exercised by organs of the state, significant other

features of the Constitution, and the legal system of this country. These features can

in my view be encapsulated in the following manner:

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 206 of 306

(i) The source of all power is ultimately referable to the sovereignty of the

People, and is channeled to the three organs of the state through the

Constitution.

(ii) The absence of any constitutional link with the native monarchical or

colonial governance past of the country.

(iii) The Constitution not recognizing that the sovereignty is vested in the

Parliament or the Parliament entertaining any supremacy in comparison

with the other two organs of the state.

(iv) Save as provided by the Constitution, the requirement that the sovereignty

of the People be exercised collectively in the manner provided in the

Constitution.

(v) The emphasis that the sovereignty of the People includes not only the

executive, legislative and judicial power, but also fundamental rights and

franchise which may be exercised individually.

(vi) The existence of a parity of status between the Executive, the Legislature and

the Judiciary, as they form the three integral, indispensable co-equal organs

of the state.

(vii) The existence of unique checks and balances which have been provided by

the Constitution essentially to prevent an abuse of power, and to ensure

legitimacy and the protection of public good.

(viii) The legal system of Sri Lanka not recognizing the existence of Royal or

Sovereign prerogatives.

(ix) All power being necessarily referable to sources of written - law which are

provided by the Constitution and other statutory instruments.

(x) Neither the President, the Parliament nor the Judiciary being vested with any

plenary power which stems from any source outside the Constitution, and

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 207 of 306

the exercise of all power being subject to Constitutional safeguards which

are aimed at the maintenance of the rule of law.

484. Nevertheless, subject to these differences, for the purpose of determining whether a

particular decision of the Executive is reviewable or not, there is significant relevance

and usefulness in courts of this country considering and applying the principles of law

recognized by the superior courts of the United Kingdom and other comparative

jurisdictions such as India, and reflected in judgments of superior courts of such

countries. Principles contained in such judgments unless for specified reasons need

to be excluded due to irrelevance, can and may be borrowed and applied to determine

local cases, with variations where necessary.

485. Be that as it may, whether or not a particular decision is reviewable is founded upon

the answer to several key issues. They are as follows:

a) jurisdiction vested in court;

b) nature of the body or office whose decision is sought to be impugned;

c) source of the power conferred on such body or office, the purported exercise

of which is being impugned;

d) character, nature and the scope of the power;

e) object and purpose for which the power has been vested;

f) the nature and scope of the discretion vested in the decision-maker;

g) impact, effect and consequences arising out of the purported exercise of the

power and the impugned decision;

h) circumstances under which the power had been exercised on the impugned

occasion;

i) factors taken into consideration by the decision-maker; and

j) reasons cited by the decision-maker for the exercise of the power.

486. Associated with and intertwined with judicial review, is the concept of ‘justiciability’.

Whether an impugned decision is justiciable or not means whether it is amenable to

judicial review through the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in Court. Determining

whether a particular decision is justiciable or not, is founded primarily upon whether

due to (a) the very nature of the power that has been exercised, (b) the purpose for

which the power has been conferred, (c) the manner in which the power has been

exercised, and (d) the impact, effect or consequences of the exercise of the power,

exercise of such power should be made susceptible to the judicial process of review,

founded upon legal standards and objective criteria, such as procedural vires, good-

faith, objectivity, reasonableness, non-arbitrariness, and proportionality.

487. A realistic and pragmatic consideration of certain instances where power has been

vested in public authorities (in particular, on the chief of the Executive branch of the

state – the President) by the Constitution and by other statutory instruments, reveal

that corresponding decision-making may justifiably not be founded upon only on

considerations which are reflective of legal standards and principles. Further, in view

of the nature of the power and the circumstances under which such power is required

to be exercised, it may not be possible to determine the lawfulness or otherwise of

such decision founded exclusively upon legal standards and principles. Furthermore,

a court of law may be ill-equipped to review the impugned decision of the Executive,

on its merits. There may be certain decisions that cannot be subject to judicial scrutiny

founded only upon legal standards and principles (provided conditions precedent to

the exercise of the power have been satisfied and the decision concerned is

procedurally intra-vires). In such circumstances, an impugned decision may not be

justiciable and hence is likely to be held by this Court to be beyond the scope of

judicial review. Therefore, unless the public authority is found to have acted in

violation of essential procedural requirements imposed by law, the Court is more likely

than not to exercise judicial restraint, and refrain from exercising judicial power and

judicially adjudicating on whether the impugned decision is lawful.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 209 of 306

488. The primary reasons for holding that a particular decision is not justiciable, are as

follows:

(i) Given the nature of the power vested, the circumstances under which the

power has been exercised and the factors taken into consideration, due

to the very nature of the process of judicial review or due to lack of

necessary expertise, the court is not sufficiently equipped or competent

to review the impugned decision.

(ii) The decision-maker was required quite justifiably to take into

consideration certain factors such as political factors which cannot be

judicially reviewed founded upon exclusively upon legal standards and

criteria.

(iii) The impugned decision is extremely complex or contains policy-laden

intricacies or polycentric issues, which make review through the judicial

process difficult, if not impossible.

(iv) The exercise of the power justifiably entails the decision-maker to

engage in making subjective choices of his own, as he has been vested

with such power to be exercised for public good.

489. While I shall remain open to further consideration and where necessary conclude

otherwise, it appears ex-facie that due to one or more of the above-listed factors,

there may be some instances where the exercise of certain powers vested in the

President by the Constitution that may not be amenable to judicial review due to want

of justiciability.

490. It is necessary to note that, it would not be appropriate to provide a list of such

powers, as such a list would not be neither exhaustive or definitive, as to whether the

exercise of a particular power under given circumstances is justiciable or not. Whether

an impugned decision should be subject to judicial review, should ideally be

determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon a consideration of inter-alia the (a)

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 210 of 306

nature of the power exercised, (b) effects arising out of the exercise of the power, (c)

grounds on which the decision is sought to be impugned, (d) factors taken into

consideration by the decision-maker, and (e) reasons and justification given by the

decision-maker for having arrived at the impugned decision. In the circumstances, a

court will not unquestioningly accept an assertion that a particular instance of exercise

of power and corresponding decision-making is not justiciable. Whether or not a

particular decision is justiciable must be determined not as a preliminary issue at the

commencement of the hearing, but at the end of the case following a consideration

of the above-mentioned factors.

491. It would be necessary to note that “judicial review has developed to the point where it

is possible to say that no power – whether statutory, common law or under a prerogative

– is any longer inherently unreviewable. Courts are charged with the responsibility of

adjudicating upon the manner of the exercise of a public power, its scope and its

substance. … even when discretionary powers are engaged, they are not immune from

judicial review. Discretion has been described as the “hole in the (legal) doughnut”, but

the hole is not automatically a lawless void. …” [De Smith’s Judicial Review, 9th Edition,

Part I, Chapter I, Part 1-03-5]

492. The above view should be seen in the backdrop of the ever-expanding canvas of

judicial review, occasioned by responsibility being conferred on courts by law to

protect public and national interests by upholding the rule of law through the exercise

of judicial review of executive decisions. Courts are being increasingly called upon to

exercise its jurisdiction by causing judicial review in order to protect public interest in

possible instances of exercise of discretionary power in a manner which may be so

manifestly contrary to the objects and purposes to be achieved by the exercise of such

power, and in the impugned occasion exercised to achieve a collateral purpose, thus

amounting to an abuse of power. In an instance of abuse of power, it is judicial review

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 211 of 306

that would enable a declaration of the unlawfulness of the impugned exercise of

power and the restoration of the harm inflicted.

493. In view of the foregoing, it would not be correct to assume that any particular power

vested in the President attaches to itself the power to exercise unfettered discretionary

authority, and that the power has been conferred on him to be exercised as a carte

blanche. All power conferred by law, must be exercised for the object and

purpose for which such power has been vested, in good-faith and objectively,

and in a manner that serves public interest. As power vested in public functionaries

have not been inherited or privately acquired by them, or been vested in them by an

all-powerful monarch or bestowed on them by a supra-natural all-mighty being, and

as power has been conferred necessarily by law, to be exercised for a specific object

and purpose, to secure public good, and not to be exercised according to the whims

and fancies of a public functionary or to achieve personal gain, the exercise of power

must be amenable to judicial review in order to ensure the exercise of such

power to be in conformity with the rule of law. However, as stated above, the

court may for good reason refrain from exercising judicial review (i) since it is

incapable of exercising judicial review as its jurisdiction has been ousted by

Parliament, or (ii) in view of the circumstances peculiar to the case at hand, the

court is incapable of determining the merits of the impugned decision purely

based on the application of legal criteria and standards. In the latter situation,

court will voluntarily restrain itself due to the reason that the impugned decision

is not justiciable, and thereby showing not servility to the decision-maker, but

prudential deference to the decision taken by the decision-maker.

494. I wish to conclude this part of the judgment by observing that non-justiciability cannot

be easily tolerated as it is against the very grain of the rule of law which is a founding

principle of this Republic, the mechanism that protects constitutionalism, and the

guarding principle for the recognition of the sovereignty of the people and protection

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 212 of 306

public interest. Thus, there exists a rebuttable presumption in favour of reviewability

of public decision-making.

Judicial Review and Justiciability of the power conferred on the President by

Article 34(1) of the Constitution

495. What is now necessary is to determine whether a decision taken by the President

acting purportedly under the powers vested in him by Article 34(1) of the Constitution

is justiciable and therefore amenable to judicial review founded not only upon

procedural regularity, but also upon the merits of the impugned decision.

496. Notwithstanding the differences in the Constitutional frameworks (listed above)

between the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka, it would be useful to bear in mind that in

Pitman v. State of Trinidad and Tobago [(2017) UKPC 6] Lord Hughes sitting in the

Bench of the Privy Council has held that “the prerogative of mercy … importantly is

subject to judicial control through judicial review”. He has in his judgment highlighted

the importance of independent judicial control of the exercise of the power of the

prerogative of mercy.

497. Following the above introductory exposition of the principles of judicial review and

justiciability, I shall now specifically deal with the several arguments placed before this

Court by the learned Additional Solicitor General.

(i) When judicially reviewing a decision of the President to grant a pardon to

a person convicted and accordingly has been condemned to suffer death by

a competent court, should this Court consider only whether the President

had acted in terms of the procedure laid down in the proviso to Article

34(1) of the Constitution, or would it be within the jurisdiction of the court

to additionally consider the lawfulness of the impugned decision based on

the merits of the decision?

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 213 of 306

498. The issue to be determined by this Court is whether, in the instant case, should judicial

review be limited to a consideration of procedural vires, or whether in addition to such

consideration, the Court is entitled in law to go into the merits of the impugned

decision founded upon legal standards and criteria.

499. In support of the submission made in this regard, the learned ASG gave four reasons.

1. In certain other jurisdictions, there exist limits on judicial reviewability of the

exercise of the power to grant pardon.

2. The scope of judicial review of the acts of the President is limited.

3. The doctrine of separation of powers supported by checks and balances

contained in the Constitution, prevents judicial review on its merits of the

impugned decision to grant a pardon.

4. The power of pardon being a sui generis power, is outside the scope of judicial

review.

500. Principles of judicial review contained in judicial precedents of other national

jurisdictions - Under this first ground, the learned ASG cited several judgments from

the United Kingdom, India and South Africa, and invited this Court to follow the

principles contained therein.

501. As regards the applicability of judgments of other countries, in Kumarage v. OIC,

Special Crimes Investigation Bureau, Ratnapura and Another [(2021) 2 Sri LR 202

at 224] this Court has made the following observations:

“… Courts must exercise great caution and apply extreme diligence when

considering a judgment of a Court of a foreign jurisdiction, as a judgment must

be necessarily viewed and appreciated in the backdrop of the applicable law,

sources of law, evolution of law, jurisdiction of the relevant Court, comparable

binding judicial precedents, subsequent developments of judicial precedents,

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 214 of 306

natural and inherent conduct of the people of that country, and the socio-cultural

and other conditions and circumstances which prevailed in such country at the

time the particular judgment was pronounced. All such relevant factors may not

be apparent ex-facie in the cited judgment and would not be within the domain

of knowledge of judges invited to consider such judgment of the relevant foreign

Court.”

502. As I have observed previously, the framework of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the

related law, stand unique due to inter-alia the ten (10) features listed earlier in this

judgment. Therefore, the powers vested in the Executive, the Legislature and the

Judiciary of Sri Lanka and the inter-organ relationship, and particularly the judicial

power conferred on the Judiciary to be exercised on behalf of the People, cannot be

compared with the judicial power vested in the judiciaries of those three countries.

Thus, the scope of judicial review which the judiciaries of the United Kingdom, India

and South Africa are empowered to exercise by their respective Constitutions and

other laws of such countries, cannot be compared with the judicial power vested in

this Court by Article 126 read with Articles 17 and 4(c) of the Constitution. Thus,

limitations if any, which the courts of such countries may have in reviewing a decision

to grant a pardon cannot be said to directly apply to this Court.

503. Be that as it may, I shall with caution consider the leading judgments cited by the

learned ASG, in order to see whether in fact, the courts of the three countries cited

above have expressed the view that they have limited jurisdiction to judicially review

decisions to grant pardons, and whether such jurisdiction is limited to reviewing

procedural vires of the impugned decision.

504. The learned ASG cited the judgment of this Court in Premachandra v. Major

Montague Jayawickrema and Another, [(1994) 2 Sri L.R. 90], wherein the Court had

quoted from a submission made by a counsel in that case referring to the judgment

of Lord Roskill the GCHQ case reported in [(1984) 3 WLR 1174], seemingly expressing

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 215 of 306

agreement with counsel that there are matters which undoubtedly do not involve

legal or constitutional rights, powers and duties, and which may therefore be regarded

as ‘purely political’. The judgment contains a quote from Lord Roskill’s judgment

extracted from the submissions of counsel to the following effect:

“Prerogative powers such as those relating to the making of treaties, the defence

of the realm, the prerogative of mercy, the grant of honours, the dissolution of

Parliament and the appointment of ministers as well as others are not, I think,

susceptible to judicial review because of their nature and subject matter are such

as not to be amenable to the judicial process.”

505. What seems to have escaped the attention of the learned ASG is the paragraph

immediately below the paragraph he has quoted from the judgment of this Court. In

that paragraph, this Court has commented as follows:

“As observed in that case, the controlling factor is not the source of the power, but

its subject matter. The fact that in the UK the appointment of ministers is by the

Queen, in the exercise of the prerogative, is beyond review does not conclude the

question under our law; as indeed it did not under the laws of Nigeria and India.

… In the absence of a written Constitution, defining the jurisdictions and powers

of the several organs of government, there may well be reasons why the acts of

the Sovereign, particularly in relation to what is historically the ‘High Court of

Parliament’, cannot be questioned in the Sovereign’s own Courts. In Sri Lanka,

however, it is the Constitution which is supreme, and a violation of the

Constitution is prima facie a matter to be remedied by the judiciary.”

[Emphasis added.]

506. Furthermore, a careful consideration of Lord Roskill’s opinion in the GCHQ Case

reflects that, his views as regards the categories of powers which may be beyond

judicial review is provisional and obiter (as held in the case of Home Department, ex-

parte Bentley). It would be seen from the case of Bentley (cited below) and Lewis v.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 216 of 306

Attorney General of Jamaica, [(2001) 2 AC 50], the law on the nature and the scope

of judicial review of prerogatives including in particular, the prerogative power of

mercy has undergone considerable evolution since the delivery of Lord Roskill’s

opinion in the GCHQ case. It is now the position of the English law that (a) a distinction

does not lie between the principles pertaining to judicial review with regard power

exercised by virtue of prerogatives and other sources of power such as statutory

power, and (b) the exercise of prerogative powers conferred by Orders in Council

could be subject to judicial review based on ordinary principles of procedural

impropriety, illegality, irrationality and proportionality. However, independent of the

source of power, reviewability may be restricted on grounds pertaining to justiciability

of the impugned decision. At present, it is observable that justiciability is founded not

upon the source of the power, not even the subject matter and its nature, but on the

factors that may be legitimately taken into consideration when exercising the power

and taking corresponding decisions.

507. Citing the judgement of Lord Justice Watkins in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home

Department, ex-parte Bentley, [(1993) 4 All ER 442 (Divisional Court of the Queen’s

Bench)], in which, the Home Secretary, based on policy, refused to recommend to the

Queen of the United Kingdom the grant of a pardon posthumously to a person

convicted of having committed murder, the learned ASG submitted that ‘there may

be certain circumstances in which the Royal prerogative of mercy is reviewable’. He

further submitted that Lord Justice Watkins had refrained from providing a definitive

answer as regards the scope of such judicial review. He submitted that Lord Justice

Watkins had allowed courts to decide on judicial reviewability on a case-by-case basis.

I do not find myself in disagreement with this submission. However, what is even more

important to note is that, Lord Justice Watkins has in his judgment observed that “…

the question is simply whether the nature and the subject matter of the decision is

amenable to the judicial process. Are the courts qualified to deal with the matter or does

the decision involve such questions of policy that they should not intrude because they

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 217 of 306

are ill-equipped to do so? Looked at in this way, there must be cases in which the exercise

of the Royal Prerogative is reviewable, in our judgment. If for example it was clear

that the Home Secretary had refused to pardon someone solely on the grounds

of their sex, race or religion, the courts would be expected to interfere, and in our

judgment, would be entitled to do so” [Emphasis added]. Thus, it is clearly seen that

R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex-parte Bentley serves as

precedent (though not binding on this Court) on the principle that even the exercise

of power under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy (in contrast with the power to grant a

pardon being conferred on the President by the Constitution) may be amenable to

review on the merits of the impugned decision such as on grounds of irrationality and

unreasonableness and proportionality.

508. Moving on to judicial precedent from India, citing the judgment of the Supreme Court

of India, in Maru Ram v Union of India and Others ([1980)] AIR 2147], the learned

ASG submitted that ‘although the executive clemency is subject to judicial review, the

Supreme Court of India has appreciated the need to not curtail “the wide power of

executive clemency” by declaring that “the wide power of executive clemency cannot be

bound down even by self-created rules.”’ The learned ASG further submitted that in the

said judgment, the Supreme Court of India has expressed the view that it is only in

rare cases where consideration will be given to whether the impugned decision is

“wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory or mala fide” and examine the decision on

that basis.

509. Upon a careful consideration of the entire judgment, I do not see support for the

ASG’s submission that a decision to grant a pardon is not subject to review on its

merits. In fact, the Maru Ram judgment supports the view that the exercise of the

power to grant a pardon is reviewable even on its merits founded upon legal

standards.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 218 of 306

510. Citing Kehar Singh and Another v. Union of India and Another [1989(1) SCC 204],

learned ASG submitted that the Supreme Court of India has observed that it was

perhaps unnecessary to spell out specific guidelines for the exercise of the power of

pardon, since such guidelines may not be able to conceive of all myriads, kinds and

categories of cases which may come up for the exercise of such power. Mr. Pulle cited

the following excerpt of the judgment:

“At the outset we think it should be clearly understood that we are confined to

the question as to the area and scope of the President’s power and not with the

question whether it has been truly exercised on the merits. Indeed, we think that

the order of the President cannot be subjected to judicial review on its merits

except within the strict limitations defined in Maru Ram, etc. v. Union of India …

The function of determining whether the act of a constitutional or statutory

functionary falls within the constitutional or legislative conferment of power, or is

vitiated by self-denial on an erroneous appreciation of the full amplitude of the

power is a matter for the court. … We are not concerned with the merits of the

decision taken by the President, nor do we see any conflict between the powers of

the President and the finality of the judicial record, a matter to which we have

adverted earlier. Nor do we dispute that the power to pardon belongs exclusively

to the President and the Governor under the Constitution.”

511. The learned ASG submitted that the Supreme Court of India had explicitly declined

considering the merits of the decision taken by the President in exercising the power

of pardons.

512. In my view, the Kehar Singh judgment must be seen in the backdrop of the facts and

circumstances of that case. Kehar Singh stood accused of having been culpable for

the murder of Prime Minister of India Srimathi Indira Gandhi. He was convicted for

that offence and sentenced to death. The appeal against the conviction was dismissed

and the Supreme Court refused the grant of special leave. A subsequent review

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 219 of 306

petition filed in court was also dismissed. Subsequently, Kehar Singh’s son Rajinder

Singh petitioned the President of India seeking the grant of a pardon to Kehar Singh.

The ground on which the pardon was sought, was that Kehar Singh had been wrongly

convicted and that he was an innocent person. In support of that ground, the

petitioner produced certain extracts of the transcript of evidence led at the trial. The

petitioner also sought an opportunity for their legal representatives to make

representations to the President in support of the petition. Subsequently, counsel

representing Kehar Singh wrote to the President and sought a hearing before the

President, to present their case. That request was denied. On behalf of the President,

it was communicated to the petitioner, that the President was of the opinion that he

cannot go into the merits of the decision finally decided by the highest court of the

land. Later, the petitioner was informed that the petition seeking a pardon was

rejected by the President. Thereafter, Kehar Singh petitioned the Supreme Court of

India seeking to impugn the decision of the President of India refusing to grant a

pardon to him.

513. A careful consideration of the judgment reveals that at the hearing before the

Supreme Court of India, several issues had been argued. In the above-mentioned

factual backdrop, and the issues argued before that court, what is relevant is that the

Supreme Court of India has in addition to what was cited by the learned ASG,

propounded the following principles:

(a) The power of pardon is a part of the constitutional scheme. This power has been

reposed by the People through the Constitution in the Head of State and enjoys

high status. It is a constitutional responsibility of great significance, to be

exercised when the occasion arises in accordance with the discretion

contemplated by the context.

(b) When exercising the power of pardon, the President acts in a wholly different

plane from that in which the court acted. He exercises a constitutional power,

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 220 of 306

the nature of which is entirely different from the judicial power and cannot be

regarded as an extension of it. This is notwithstanding the practical effect of the

presidential act that results in the removal of the stigma attaching the accused

of having been found ‘guilty’ and the practical effect of commuting the sentence

imposed on him. The legal effect of a pardon is wholly different from a judicial

supersession of the original sentence.

(c) The President is entitled to examine the case record containing evidence of the

criminal case and determine for himself whether the case is one that deserves

the grant of relief. The President is entitled to go into the merits of the case,

notwithstanding that it has been judicially concluded by the consideration given

to it by the court.

(d) There is no right for the condemned prisoner to insist on an oral hearing before

the President. The manner of consideration of the petition lies within the

discretion of the President, and it is for him to decide how best he can acquaint

himself with all the information that is necessary for the proper and effective

disposal of the petition.

(e) The order of the President cannot be judicially reviewed on its merits

except within the strict limitations defined in Maru Ram v. Union of India.

(f) The function of determining whether the act of a constitutional or

statutory functionary falls within the constitutional or legislative

conferment of power, or is vitiated by self-denial on an erroneous

appreciation of the full amplitude of the power, is a matter for the Court

exercising judicial review.

(g) The area of the President’s power to grant a pardon falls squarely within

the judicial domain and can be examined by the Court by judicial review.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 221 of 306

514. In my view, the above-mentioned principles must be seen in the light of the following

distinguishing features between the power to grant pardon vested in the President of

India, and the power conferred on the President of Sri Lanka by our Constitution. First,

the President of India does not by himself exercise executive power, and he must act

on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. That is not the

situation under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Second, Article 72 of the Constitution of

India does not contain a requirement parallel to the proviso to Article 34(1) of the

Constitution of this country, which necessitates the President of India to adhere to a

stipulated procedure when determining whether or not a pardon should be granted

to a person who has been condemned to suffer death. Furthermore, in any event,

when seen in the backdrop of the issues the Supreme Court was required to

adjudicate upon in that case, the observation of the Supreme Court of India that, the

order of the President cannot be subjected to judicial review on its merits, is obiter

dicta. In any event, the Supreme Court of India has conceded that the order of the

President regarding the grant or otherwise of a pardon can be judicially

reviewed even on the merits, within the scope defined in the case of Maru Ram.

And in Maru Ram the Supreme Court of India held that a decision of the

President with regard to a pardon can be reviewed on its merits on grounds of

irrelevancy, irrationality, discrimination or mala fides. However, by the use of

the terms ‘wholly irrelevant’ and ‘wholly irrational’, the court has insisted on a

very high threshold.

515. It is thus seen that judicial precedent of India shows clearly that the decision of the

President on the grant or refusal to grant a pardon can be judicially reviewed on its

merits based on the criteria referred to in the Maru Ram case.

516. Furthermore, it is pertinent to note that in Kehar Singh case, the Supreme Court of

India has also proceeded to hold that “wide as the power of pardon, commutation and

release … is, it cannot run riot”, that “… all public power including constitutional power,

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 222 of 306

shall never be exercisable arbitrarily or mala fide …” and that “the power to pardon,

grant remission and commutation, being of the greatest moment for the liberty of a

citizen, cannot be a law unto itself, but must be informed by the finer canons of

constitutionalism”. These observations lend support to the submissions of the learned

President’s Counsel for the Petitioner and the 9th and 10th Respondents, that the

decision of the President either to grant or refuse to grant a pardon, is subject to

judicial review not only on the ground of procedural regularity, but on the merits of

the decision as well.

517. In view of the above analysis, I find myself unable to accept the learned ASG’s

assertion that ‘the Indian Supreme Court has explicitly declined considering the merits

of the decision taken by the President in exercising the power of pardon.’ In fact, the

position of judicial precedent of India regarding that point is to the contrary. The

Supreme Court of India has very specifically held that such decision is reviewable on

its merits on grounds of irrelevancy, unreasonableness (when the impugned decision

is wholly unreasonable), discrimination and mala fides. The acceptance of these

principles is seen even in the more recent case of Swaran Singh v. State of U.P.

[(1998) 4 S.C.C. 75] and Bikas Chatterjee v. Union of India [(2004) 7 S.C.C. 634]. In

the Swaran Singh case, the Court relying on the position taken up in Kehar Singh v

Union of India, has held that “if such power was exercised arbitrarily, mala fide or in

absolute disregard of the finer canons of constitutionalism, the by-product order cannot

get the approval of the law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it.”

It is notable that in the case of Epuru Sudhakar and Another v Government of

Andhra Pradesh [2006 AIR SC 3385], the Supreme Court, setting aside an order of a

Governor of a State to grant a pardon, held that the orders of the President or the

Governor under Articles 72 or Article 161, as the case may be, can be subject to judicial

review, and can be impugned on the basis that (i) such order has been passed without

application of mind; (ii) the order is mala fide; (iii) the order has been passed found

on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (v) relevant material have been kept

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 223 of 306

out of consideration, and (vi) the order suffers from arbitrariness. The court advanced

a step further to hold that “since there is a power of judicial review, however limited it

may be, the same can be rendered to be an exercise in futility in the absence of reasons”.

It was further held that “…a person who seeks exercise of highly discretionary power of

a high constitutional authority, has to show bona fides and must place material with

clean hands”.

518. It is also important to note that, none of the judgments of the Supreme Court of India

cited by the learned ASG contain any view which departs from the grounds of judicial

review on the merits contained in the Maru Ram case.

519. The learned ASG also submitted to the attention of this Court certain judgments of

the Constitutional Court of South Africa. While one such case has been decided based

on the ‘interim Constitution of South Africa’ (which was in force only from 1994 to

1997), the other cases have been decided on the present Constitution of South Africa.

I shall refrain from commenting on those judgments, since this Court does not have

the expertise or the resources that would be necessary to determine the applicability

of the legal principles contained therein to the legal system of Sri Lanka.

The scope of judicial review of the acts of the President in Sri Lanka

520. The learned ASG submitted that this Court has so far not determined that all acts of

the President are subject to judicial review. In support of that contention, he submitted

the judgment of a Divisional Bench of this Court in Rajavarothiam Sampanthan v.

Hon. Attorney-General and Others [SC FR Application No. 351/2018, SC Minutes of

13th December 2018].

521. It would be seen that in the said case, a Divisional Bench of this Court was called upon

inter alia to determine whether the Court had jurisdiction to judicially review a

decision of the President who had purportedly acted under and in terms of Articles

70(1) of the Constitution in dissolving the Parliament and calling for a General Election.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 224 of 306

It had been contended on behalf of the President that the President’s decision was a

‘political decision’ as when taking the impugned decision, the President had taken into

consideration certain ‘political’ factors. Perusal of the judgment reveals that the

Honourable Attorney General had submitted that in the circumstances, the impugned

decision was ‘not justiciable’ under Article 126 of the Constitution. In that regard, the

judgment of Chief Justice Nalin Perera contains the following passage:

“It appears to me that this is an appropriate instance in which the maxim should

be applied to raise the inference that to the exclusion of the power to declare War

and Peace under Article 33 (2) (g) from the ambit of the Proviso to Article 35(1)

of the Constitution denotes that all the other powers of the President which are

listed in Article 33 (2) are, subject to review by way of an application under Article

126 in appropriate circumstances which demand the Court‘s review of those

powers. No doubt some of the powers vested in the President by Article 33

(2) may not, in practice, be reviewable by an application under Article 126

depending on the facts before court. For example, it is hard to think of

instances where the performance by the President of a purely ceremonial function

[as under Article 33 (2) (b)] would be amenable to review by this Court. On the

other hand, it is conceivable that several of the other executive powers

vested in the president by Article 33 (2) (c) [other than under Article 33 (2)

(g) which is expressly excluded] could be, in appropriate circumstances,

subject to challenge under a fundamental rights application under Article

126.

In this connection, it is relevant to mention here the decision in EDWARD SILVA

vs. BANDARANYAKE [1997 1 SLR 92 at p. 95] where Fernando J, referring to the

President‘s power of appointing Judges of the Supreme Court stated “The learned

Attorney-General submitted that the President in exercising the power conferred

by Article 107 had a "sole discretion". I agree with this view. This means that the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 225 of 306

eventual act of appointment is performed by the President and concludes the

process of selection. It also means that the power is neither untrammelled nor

unrestrained, and ought to be exercised within limits, for, as the learned Attorney-

General said, the power is discretionary and not absolute. This is obvious. If, for

instance, the President were to appoint a person who, it is later found, had passed

the age of retirement laid down in Article 107(5), undoubtedly the appointment

would be flawed: because it is the will of the People, which that provision

manifests, that such a person cannot hold that office. Article 126 would then

require this Court, in appropriate proceedings, to exercise its judicial power in

order to determine those questions of age and ineligibility. Other instances which

readily come to mind are the appointment of a non-citizen, a minor, a bankrupt,

a person of unsound mind, a person who is not an Attorney-at-Law or who has

been disbarred, or a person convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude.”

It should also be mentioned that in SINGARASA vs. AG (supra) S.N. Silva CJ held

that the accession by the then President to the Optional Protocol to the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was in excess of the power of

the President as contained in the then Article 33 (f) of the Constitution [which is

on the same lines as Article 33 (2) (h) of the Constitution after the 19th

Amendment] and did not bind the Republic qua State and has no legal effect

within the State. Although that was a decision where the Supreme Court was

hearing an Application for Special Leave to Appeal from a judgment of the Court

of Appeal, the principle laid down by the Court that an act of the President

in the exercise of his powers under Article 33 (2) (h) is subject to review by

the Court fortifies the conclusion reached above that all the powers listed

in Article 33 (2) [except the power to declare War and Peace listed in

Article 33 (2) (g)] are subject to review under Article 126 in appropriate

circumstances.” [Emphasis added.]

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 226 of 306

522. Thus, it is seen that in the context of the submissions made in that case before the

Supreme Court, the Divisional Bench has held that, some of the powers vested in the

President by Article 33 (2) of the Constitution may not, in practice, be reviewable in

an Application under Article 126. That would in my view be dependent on the facts

before court and the grounds of impugning the decision. The Divisional Bench has

proceeded to hold that, for example, it is hard to think of instances where the

performance by the President of a purely ceremonial function [such as under Article

33 (2) (b)] would be amenable to review by this Court.

523. With regard to the judgment of the Divisional Bench, I wish to observe the following:

- First, the afore-stated observation (cited by the learned ASG) is obiter in

comparison with the key issues determined by the Divisional Bench in that case.

What appears evidently as being a ratio decidendi of that judgment is the fact

that a decision of the President to dissolve Parliament taken ostensibly under

Article 70(1) of the Constitution is reviewable under the jurisdiction vested in

the Supreme Court by Article 126 read with 17 of the Constitution.

- Second, the Court has proceeded to observe that it is conceivable that some of

the other executive powers vested in the President by Article 33 (2) [other than

under Article 33(2)(g), which is expressly excluded] could in appropriate

circumstances be subject to challenge in an Application alleging an

infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights.

- Third, the Divisional Bench appears to have been acutely conscious that

reviewability (excluding the power vested in the President by Article 33(2)(g) of

the Constitution to declare ‘war and peace’) is primarily founded upon factors

which the decision-maker (the President) had taken into consideration when

arriving at the impugned decision. Should it be presented to Court that the in

the circumstances of the case, the President was required to take into

consideration factors inter alia certain factors which cannot be assessed purely

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 227 of 306

founded upon legal criteria and standards and therefore not justiciable, the

Court would then refrain from judicially reviewing the impugned decision, not

because it lacks jurisdiction, but because the impugned decision is unsuitable

for judicial review due to reasons of non-justiciability.

- Fourth, the decision of the Divisional Bench contains no reference to the

reviewability of the power of the President to grant a pardon under and in terms

of Article 34 of the Constitution.

524. It is important to note that, in matters where the decision-maker cites reasons for his

decision which cannot be assessed purely based on legal standards and criteria,

refraining from engaging in judicial review would not be founded upon the absence

or lack of jurisdiction of the Court to cause judicial review, but on the premise that

given the reasons for the decision cited by the President, the impugned decision of

the President cannot be judicially reviewed as the issues involved are non-justiciable.

525. I have observed that in the instant matter, neither the 11A Respondent – former

President nor the Honourable Attorney-General has asserted that when arriving at the

impugned decision to grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent, the decision-maker (the

President) had to (as he was required to) take into consideration certain factors which

are not justiciable before a court of law.

526. Due to the afore-stated reasons, guided by judicial precedent (cited above) and the

findings of Justice Surasena in the Duminda Silva pardon case, I hold that a decision

of the President on the grant or refusal of the grant of a pardon is reviewable

by the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction contained in Article 126

read with Article 17 of the Constitution, not only on grounds of procedural vires,

but on the merits of the decision as well.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 228 of 306

Judicial review of the exercise of the power to grant a Pardon on its merits and

the doctrine of separation of powers and the checks and balances contained in

the Constitution

527. In this regard, the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General was that

judicial review of the exercise of power by the President to grant a pardon to a person,

founded upon the merits of the decision would violate the doctrine of separation of

powers recognized by the Constitution, and it would inter alia, impede upon the

checks and balances contained in the Constitution. He therefore asserted that, this

Court should refrain from reviewing the impugned decision.

528. The mechanism of separation of powers with functions of government (the ‘state’)

being recognized separately in a tripartite manner as ‘executive’, ‘legislative’ and

‘judicial’ and such functions being separately assigned to be exercised by three

different persons or institutions, with there being a bar on the functions assigned to

one person or an institution being exercised by another, has evolved over a period of

time. The system of governance through the separation of powers should be primarily

viewed as being distinct from the system of governance by monarchs, who possessed

the source of all powers and exercised plenary executive, legislative and judicial

power. There is thus a monopoly of power vested in the monarch. In monarchical

governance systems, all officials and institutions of governance derived power from

the monarch. They exercised power to the extent such power was vested in them by

the monarch and necessarily subordinate to the monarch.

529. Principles embedded in the system of governance which recognizes separation of

powers has been hardened into a doctrine. A study of this doctrine, as elaborated by

British philosopher John Locke (1632 - 1704) and the French jurist Baron de

Montesquieu (1689 - 1757), reveals that in order to secure liberty and to prevent the

abuse of power, the three types of powers of the state should be exercised separately

by three different organs, subject to necessary checks on each other. Baron de

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 229 of 306

Montesquieu’s view was that liberty cannot exist within a monopoly of power. In his

seminal work The Spirit of Laws [translated from the French by Thomas Nugent, LL.D,

Revised Edition, volume 1, The Colonial Press, at pages 151-152], he has explained the

doctrine in the following manner:

“When legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the

same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may

arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute

them in a tyrannical manner.

Again, there is no liberty, if the judicial power be not separated from the legislative

and executive. Were it joined with the legislature, the life and liberty of the

subjects would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the

legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with

violence and oppression.

There would be an end of everything, were the same man or the same body,

whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of

enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of

individuals.”

530. In this regard, Hilaire Barnett on Constitutional & Administrative Law (4th Edition,

2002), has upon examining the historical development of this doctrine of separation

of powers, explaining the concept of checks and balances, and the need for it, has

stated the following:

“Throughout history, there has been exhibited a tension between the doctrine of

separation of powers and the need for balanced government – an arrangement

depending more on checks and balances within the system … than on a

formalistic separation of powers. Sir Ivor Jennings has interpreted Montesquieu’s

words to mean not that the legislature and the executive should have no influence

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 230 of 306

over the other, but rather that neither should exercise the power of the other. Sir

William Blackstone, a disciple of Montesquieu, adopted and adapted

Montesquieu’s strict doctrine, reworking his central idea to incorporate the theory

of mixed government. While it was of central importance to Blackstone, for

example, the executive and legislature should be sufficiently separate to avoid

‘tyranny’, he nevertheless viewed their total separation as potentially leading to

dominance of the executive by the legislature. Thus, partial separation of powers

was required to achieve a mixed balanced constitutional structure.”

531. Commenting on the modern doctrine of the separation of powers, Barnett also

observes the following:

“The separation of powers doctrine does not insist that there should be three

institutions of government each operating in isolation from each other… Under

such an arrangement, it is essential that there be a sufficient interplay between

each institute of the state. … A complete separation of the three institutions could

result in legal and constitutional deadlock. Rather than a pure separation of

powers, the concept insists that the primary functions of the state should be

allocated clearly and that there should be checks to ensure that no institute

encroaches significantly upon the function of the other.”

532. Thus, the essence of the doctrine of separation of powers is that, there should be

ideally a clear demarcation in functions between the Legislature, the Executive and

the Judiciary, and such power should be vested separately in three distinct organs.

Further, none of the organs should have excessive power, and towards that objective,

there should be in place, a system of checks and balances between the institutions, so

that, possible abuse of power can be prevented or remedied. Therefore, it is evident

that under the contemporary doctrine of separation of powers, having a rigid

separation of powers and functions, indeed would neither be practical nor desirable.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 231 of 306

533. In order to secure the rule of law, good governance and respect to individual liberty

and other rights of the People, the system of separation of powers has been

incorporated into many contemporary Constitutions, particularly Constitutions of

Republics, but not limited thereto.

534. It is almost impossible to define each of the three powers - ‘executive’, ‘legislative’

and ‘judicial’ in a way that reveals them as mutually exclusive concepts. At the same

time, the complete compartmentalization of powers in the three organs of the state

can result in impracticality and inefficacy in the functioning of those organs. It is for

this purpose that checks and balances exist. The concept of checks and balances

implies that while the three organs of government exercise powers within strict limits

and bounds, there exists an equilibrium between the three organs of the state and a

balance of power. Further, each organ of the state should act as a watchdog over the

other, so as to prevent, eliminate or remedy any abuse of power by such other organ

of the state. A balance in power and smooth functioning between organs of the state

can be ideally achieved through cooperation. However, while there can be a

cooperative approach between the Legislature and the Executive, due to the very

nature of adjudication which is required to be carried out for the purpose of the

administration of justice, the Judiciary must necessarily remain independent, impartial

and neutral. Thus, it would be inappropriate and most undesirable for the Judiciary to

be called upon to ‘cooperate’ with the Legislature and the Executive. This is evident,

even by Baron de Montesquieu’s exposition that “there is no liberty, if the judicial

power be not separated from the legislative and executive”. What is necessary is for the

Judiciary, to abide by the rule of law and the jurisdiction vested in courts, adhere to

judicial ethics, and administer justice according to law. For that purpose, the Judiciary

may exercise powers vested in courts to the extent they are conferred on courts by

the Constitution and other laws. Towards the objective of administering justice, the

courts shall apply both the written and the unwritten law. The independence of the

judiciary is thus, at the core of the doctrine of separation of powers.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 232 of 306

535. In the case of Sri Lanka Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya v Sri Lanka Hadabima

Authority [(2015) 1 Sri L R 258], it was held that “Article 111C of the Constitution is a

manifest intention to ensure that the judiciary is free from interferences whatsoever”

and thus, “there is a clear demarcation of powers between the judiciary and the other

two organs of government, namely, the executive and the legislature”. It was further

held that any act or decision to interfere with judicial power is outside the competence

of the Legislature and the Executive, and are inconsistent with the separation of

powers between the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary enshrined in the Constitution.

Court observed that such acts or decisions are ultra vires and have no force or power

in law.

536. Article 3 of the Constitution vests sovereignty in the people. Indeed, as submitted by

the learned ASG, the powers of the government (the ‘state’) are components of the

sovereignty of the People and have been assigned to the Executive, the Legislature

and the Judiciary. Further, Article 4 of the Constitution makes it evident that the

legislative power of the People is to be exercised by Parliament, the executive power

of the People is to be exercised by President, and the judicial power of the people is

to be exercised by Parliament through courts. Thus, the constituent powers of the

state emanating from the sovereignty of the People are to be exercised by these three

organs of the state, and has been distinctly and separately demarcated by the

Constitution. The norm is that, subject to the provisions of the Constitution (which

provisions serve as exceptions to the norm and is clearly spelt out in the Constitution),

the Parliament does not possess any executive or judicial power, the President does

not possess any legislative or judicial power, and the Judiciary does not possess any

legislative or executive power. Thus, doctrinally, it is well-established that the principle

of separation of powers is one of the principles of constitutionalism founded upon

which the Constitution has been created. Furthermore, that the Constitution deals in

three distinct and separate chapters, the powers of the Executive, the Legislature and

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 233 of 306

the Judiciary, lends support to the position that the 1978 Constitution is based on the

doctrine of separation of powers.

537. The several exceptions to (deviations from) the doctrine of separation of powers, as

contained in the Constitution is where (i) judicial power is exercised by Parliament [as

regards matters relating to privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its

members – Article 4(c)], (ii) legislative power is exercised by the President as regards

the promulgation of Emergency Regulations [Article 155 of the Constitution read with

the provisions of the Public Security Ordinance and Article 76(1)], and (iii) legislative

power is exercised by the Judiciary [Article 136], has been specifically stated and is

limited in nature and scope. Such deviations from the norm have been necessitated

in view of the purposes for which such powers are to be exercised and the

circumstances and exigencies under which such powers are required to be exercised.

The framers of the Constitution have deemed that conferment of such exceptional

power serves the best interests of the Public.

538. The Constitution also contains certain specific mechanisms which the learned ASG

referred to as ‘checks’. These mechanisms enable not only the emergence of a parity

of status between the three organs of the state, but also safety measures to prevent

an abuse of power by any one organ of the state, and to provide for remedial

measures in the event of a violation of the Constitution. The power conferred on

Parliament by Article 38(2) of the Constitution to impeach the President which if

successful would result in the dismissal of the President and a vacancy arising in the

seat of the presidency, is one example. Another example would be the power vested

in the President by Article 70(1) of the Constitution to dissolve Parliament, which

would result in the holding of a General Election and the re-composition of the

Parliament. Similarly, save one exception [Article 33(g)], acts of the President are

subject to the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court by virtue of the proviso to

Article 35(1) of the Constitution read with Articles 126 and 17.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 234 of 306

539. It is important to note that, as it is the People who are collectively the sovereigns of

the country, the People too have been vested with power to exercise a check on the

three organs of the state. That is through the exercise of the remaining two elements

of the sovereignty of the People, namely fundamental rights [Article 4(d)] and

franchise [Article 4(e)] which may be individually exercised by them. Furthermore, the

People have been vested with supreme legislative power by Article 83, which shall be

exercised at a Referendum in the circumstances provided in the Constitution. Thus,

the ultimate ‘check’ on all three organs of the state is vested in the People, as it is they

who are sovereign.

540. Both exceptions to the doctrine of separation of powers and the ‘checks and balances’

where they exist, are clearly and specifically stated in the Constitution, and the

circumstances under which such exceptional power may be exercised is categorically

laid down in the Constitution with clarity and precision. Thus, there exists no necessity

to assume the existence of such ‘checks and balances’. A ‘check’ or a ‘balance’ must be

explicitly evident from a plain reading of the Constitution. That indeed must

necessarily be so. Furthermore, the conferment of powers which serves as exceptions

to the doctrine of separation of powers and their exercise, should not result in a

negation of a particular instance of the exercise of power that is vested in any

particular organ of the state. Therefore, ‘checks and balances’ incorporated into the

Constitution would not result in the review or revision of the exercise of any particular

instance of power by the organ to which such power has been ordinarily conferred by

the Constitution. This must necessarily be so, as otherwise, there is room for the abuse

of such power and disruption of the delicate equilibrium of power between the three

organs of the state. A disruption of that equilibrium would result in disastrous

consequences including a serious deterioration of compliance with the rule of law and

the gradual development of an anarchic and dictatorial situation with the People

losing their sovereignty.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 235 of 306

541. In this regard, it would be necessary to be reminded of the following passage

contained in the Special Determination of the Supreme Court relating to the

Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill [(SC SD 11/2002), Decisions of the

Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003) Volume VII]:

“…Inalienability of sovereignty, in relation to each organ of government means

that power vested by the Constitution in one organ of government shall not be

transferred to another organ of government, or relinquished or removed from that

organ of government to which it is attributed by the Constitution. Therefore, shorn

of all flourishes of Constitutional law and of political theory, on a plain

interpretation of the relevant Articles of the Constitution, it could be stated that

any power that is attributed by the Constitution to one organ of government

cannot be transferred to another organ of government or relinquished or removed

from that organ of government; and such transfer, relinquishment or removal

would be an ‘alienation’ of sovereignty which is inconsistent with Article 3 read

together with Article 4 of the Constitution. It necessarily follows that the

balance that has been struck between the three organs of government in

relation to the power that is attributed to each such organ, has to be

preserved if the Constitution itself is to be sustained.” [Emphasis added.]

542. Further, in the Special Determination of the Supreme Court relating to the Twenty

First Amendment to the Constitution Bill [SC SD 31/2022], it was held that, in the

Constitution, the powers and functions of one branch of government are carefully

balanced against those of the other two branches of government. This Court has

observed that it is “a delicate balance”, and that “machinery of government is calibrated

to the extent that its parts are not to be moved without the knowledge and consent of

its masters, the People”.

543. In the Special Determination of the Supreme Court on the Twenty Second

Amendment to the Constitution Bill [SC SD 40-49/2022], the Court endorsed the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 236 of 306

view that was taken by the Court in the Special Determination of the Supreme Court

on the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution Bill.

544. In the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution (cited above), the Court also held

the following view:

“This balance of power between the three organs of government, as in the case of

other Constitutions based on a separation of power is sustained by certain checks

whereby power is attributed to one organ of government in relation to another.

The dissolution of Parliament and impeachment of the President are some of

these powers which constitute the checks incorporated in our Constitution.

Interestingly, these powers are found in chapters that contain provisions relating

to the particular organ of government subject to the check. Thus, provision for

impeachment of the President is found in Article 38(2) contained in Chapter VII

titled, ‘The Executive, President of the Republic’. Similarly, the dissolution of

Parliament is found in Article 70(1), which is contained in Chapter XI titled, ‘The

Legislature, Procedure and Powers’.”

545. It is noteworthy that, unlike the ‘checks’ contained in the Constitution in respect of the

exercise of executive power by the President and legislative power by the Parliament,

the Constitution does not contain any ‘check’ which the Legislature or the Executive

may exercise in respect of the Judiciary as regards the exercise of judicial power. Even

the Parliament cannot legislate to annul a specific order or judgment of a court, as

the enactment of such legislation would amount to legislation ad hominem and hence

would be in violation of Article 4(b) read with Article 3 of the Constitution.

546. The learned ASG submitted that ‘Article 34 of the Constitution which allows the

President to grant pardons is part of the mechanism of ‘checks and balances’ in the

Constitution. … this power allows for the President to act as a check upon the decisions

of the judiciary where necessary, in recognition of the fallibility of the judiciary, although

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 237 of 306

it may not necessarily be the only ground for pardoning …’. Acceptance of this

submission is not possible for the following reasons:

(a) A consideration of the provisions of the Constitution reveals the existence of a

system of delicate ‘balancing’ of executive, legislative and judicial powers, and

a system of ‘checks’ between only the Legislature and Executive. The

Constitution does not provide for either the Legislature or the Executive to

exercise any ‘checks’ on the judiciary. Conferring on the Parliament and the

President any power to ‘check’ the exercise of judicial power would defeat the

very purpose for which the People’s judicial power has been conferred on the

Parliament to be exercised through courts.

(b) The power conferred on the President by Articles 33(f) and 107(1) to, with the

approval of the Constitutional Council appoint the Chief Justice, Judges of the

Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Judges of the

Court of Appeal and the power vested in the Parliament to exercise disciplinary

control over such judges through the process provided for in Article 107(2) of

the Constitution, is different to the system of ‘checks and balances’ which is

associated with the doctrine of separation of powers. The exercise of that power

by the President and the Constitutional Council and the President and the

Parliament, respectively, do not relate to keeping a ‘check’ on the exercise of

judicial power by the Judiciary. It is a safeguard in preserving the institutional

independence of the judiciary.

(c) If Article 34 confers on the President the power to ‘check upon the decisions of

the judiciary’, and by the grant of a pardon, correct an error and arrive at a fresh

finding, that would amount to an exercise of judicial power by the President.

The Constitution has not conferred judicial power to be exercised by the

President. Further, exercise of judicial power by the President would be contrary

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 238 of 306

to and in violation of Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution and the doctrine of

separation of powers.

(d) Acceptance of the supposition of the learned ASG that the power conferred on

the President by Article 34 is to enable the President to keep a ‘check’ on the

exercise of judicial power by the Judiciary, would in effect place the President

in a position superior to that of the highest court in the hierarchy of the judicial

structure recognized by the Constitution, and it would thus violate the basic

constitutional framework recognized by the Constitution and the parity of

status conferred on the three organs of the state by the Constitution.

(e) As rightly agreed by learned counsel during the hearing of this matter, the

exercise of power under Article 34 is an instance of the President exercising

‘executive power’. That position has been advanced by the learned ASG in his

post-argument written submissions as well. Using executive power to strike off

or annul the effect of a judgment of court which includes the order of sentence

imposed by court, would violate all basic norms of constitutionalism recognized

by the Constitution of this country, and would in effect result in a fundamental

violation of the rule of law. It would also consequently suppress administration

of criminal justice by an independent judiciary to the whims and fancies of the

executive President. The President may grant a pardon to a convict, in respect

of whom, new evidence has emerged which shows that he should not have been

convicted. In such a situation, the grant of a pardon would be to remedy a

miscarriage of justice. That too would not be exercising a ‘check’ on the judiciary.

(f) If the power of the President under Article 34 is a ‘check’ on the judiciary, in that

it provides relief against judicial error, how does that same power act as a ‘check’

on the judiciary, when a pardon is granted for a different purpose not linked to

the judicial pronouncement, for instance, when pardoning a terminally ill

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 239 of 306

convict? Therefore, the argument that the power under Article 34 acts as a

‘check’ on the judiciary to correct a judicial error, is not a tenable.

(g) Acceptance of the theory propounded by the learned ASG would result in the

partial alienation of the exercise of judicial power by the Judiciary to the

President, which would violate Article 4(c) of the Constitution and in effect

impinge upon the sovereignty vested in the People by Article 3. It would also

make the Judiciary subordinate to the President, a feature totally non-existent

in the Constitution and a direct obliteration of the independence of the judiciary

resulting in an erosion of the rule of law.

547. Due to the afore-stated reasons, I reject the position advanced by the learned ASG

that, this Court should not judicially review a decision of the President to grant a

pardon on its merits, since the grant of a pardon is a ‘check’ on the judiciary by the

Executive (President), and engaging in judicial review of the impugned decision would

be in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers and would render nugatory the

afore-stated ‘check’.

Delegation Test and the Alienation Test

548. Learned ASG also submitted that if the exercise of the power of pardon vested in the

President by Article 34 of the Constitution is reviewed on the merits of the decision,

by this Court in the exercise of the fundamental rights jurisdiction, “it would fail the

delegation test as it would ‘bring in another person or institution’ into the exercise of

such power”. He further contended that therefore, it would also constitute a ‘transfer,

relinquishment or removal’ of a power attributed to the President to another, as it

would allow the Supreme Court instead of the President to take decisions regarding

who would be given a pardon. In support of this contention, he cited the views of this

Court in the Special Determination on the Twenty First Amendment to the

Constitution Bill [SC SD 31-37/2022] wherein, the Court has propounded two tests

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 240 of 306

to determine instances where a violation of Article 4 would amount to a violation of

Article 3 of the Constitution. Those two tests are the following:

“Accordingly, it is our view that the proper tests to be adopted in determining

whether a violation of Article 4 leads to a violation of Article 3 are as follows:

1. Different features of the Sovereignty that is reposed in the People can be

delegated by the People to be exercised by an organ of government. Delegation

by the People of the Sovereignty reposed in them is part of their Sovereignty

identified in Article 3. Article 4 deals with both the delegation and the exercise of

different features of Sovereignty. In terms of Article 4(b), the People have

delegated their executive power to the President elected by them. Any change to

such delegation which brings in another person or institution to exercise the

executive power of the People must be with the approval of the People as

otherwise it infringes Article 3 (Delegation test).

2. The transfer, relinquishment, or removal of a power attributed to one organ of

Government to another organ or body would be inconsistent with Article 3 read

with Article 4 of the Constitution (Alienation Test).

549. Learned ASG also cited the views of this Court in Maithripala Senanayake, Governor

of the North Central Province and Another v Gamage Don Mahindasoma and

Others [(1998) 2 Sri L R 333], to support his submission that even pursuant to the

devolution of power effected by the 13th Amendment, the Supreme Court has held

that it is the President who is supreme in granting pardons, showcasing the intention

of the drafters of the Constitution that the President’s power to pardon is not to be

alienated or delegated to any other authority.

550. Learned ASG’s submission that it is the President who is supreme in granting pardons,

and that even in the context of a devolution of power, the power of the President to

grant a pardon has not been alienated or delegated to another authority, further

supports the view of this Court that the power of the President to grant pardons is

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 241 of 306

not a sui generis power and is thus a purely executive power. That aspect will be dealt

with next in this judgment.

551. I find no reason to deviate from the description provided by this Court relating to the

Delegation Test and the Alienation Test. Indeed, compliance with both tests is

necessary. However, I must reject the learned ASG’s contention that this Court

reviewing a decision taken by the President to grant a pardon purportedly under the

authority conferred on him by Article 34, on the merits of the decision is a violation

of the delegation test. Judicial review is not a means of the judiciary taking over the

decision-making process exercised by the Executive. Exercising judicial review of the

President’s decision to grant a pardon to a convicted person, does not result in the

judiciary exercising the power conferred on the President by Article 34 of the

Constitution. Thus, it would be incorrect to assert that through the exercise of judicial

review, the Judiciary would be acting in breach of the ‘Delegation test’. Through the

exercise of judicial review, the Judiciary will not transfer to itself and thereby remove

the power conferred on the President by the Constitution. In a situation where the

Supreme Court exercises judicial review of an impugned instance where the President

has exercised power purportedly under Article 34 and has granted a pardon to a

particular person, and determines that the exercise of such power had been unlawful

and therefore quashes the decision to grant the pardon, it would be open to the

President to once again consider the grant of a pardon to the same person, provided

the President acts in terms of the law and the merits of the case warrant the grant of

a pardon and making the grant of such pardon lawful.

Nature of the power conferred on the President to grant a Pardon

552. Learned ASG submitted that, though in terms of the Constitution the President has

been vested with executive power, it does not mean that the exercise of all powers of

the President constitute ‘executive or administrative’ action. He further submitted that

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 242 of 306

the power to grant a pardon vested in the President by Article 34 cannot be exclusively

categorized as executive, judicial or legislative, and should be recognized as a ‘sui

generis’ power. In support of his argument, he cited the judgments of this Court in

Attorney General v. Dr. Upatissa Atapattu Bandaranayake Wasala Mudiyanse

Ralahamilage Shirani Anshumala Bandaranayake [SC Appeal 67/2013, SC Minutes

of 21st February 2014] and Athula Chandraguptha Thenuwara and Others v.

Chamal Rajapakse, Speaker of Parliament and Others [SC/FR 665-672/2012, SC

Minutes 24th March 2014]. It was submitted that the Supreme Court has in these two

judgments held that there are certain functions and powers contained in the

Constitution, which are sui generis in nature, and that therefore they cannot be

categorized as executive, legislative or judicial functions and powers. He thus

submitted that such functions and corresponding powers are not amenable to the

fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court, as they are not ‘executive or

administrative action’. Learned ASG also contended that the judgment in Athula

Chandraguptha Thenuwara and Others v Chamal Rajapakse, Speaker of

Parliament and Others (cited above) has been quoted with approval in the case of

Rajavarothiam Sampanthan and Others v Attorney General (cited above), and that

the Court has not rejected the possibility of the President possessing sui generis

powers, although, in that matter, the impugned acts did not constitute any such sui

generis powers. He submitted that the power to grant a pardon under Article 34 of

the Constitution is one such sui generis power, and hence is not amenable to the

fundamental rights jurisdiction.

553. A perusal of the judgement in Attorney-General v. Shirani Anshumala

Bandaranayake (cited above), reveals that, the two questions of law that had arisen

for consideration in that matter was (i) whether the Court of Appeal had erred in

holding that the writ jurisdiction of that Court embodied in Article 140 of the

Constitution extends to proceedings of Parliament and to a Committee of Parliament,

and (ii) whether the Court of Appeal had erred in holding that the words “any Court

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 243 of 306

of first instance or tribunal or other institution or any other person” contained in Article

140 of the Constitution extends to the Parliament and to a Committee of Parliament.

In the context of the factual circumstances of that case, the issue to be determined by

the Supreme Court was whether the Court of Appeal was possessed of jurisdiction to

issue an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari in terms of Article 140 of the

Constitution in respect of proceedings and actions of Parliament or that of a Select

Committee of Parliament, within the process of impeachment of the Chief Justice of

Sri Lanka under Article 107 of the Constitution. Justice Saleem Marsoof expressing

agreement with an incidental submission made in that case by the Attorney-General,

has observed that the power to remove the Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme

Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and Judges of the Court of Appeal through

the process contained in Article 107 of the Constitution and Standing Orders made

thereunder, is not a power exclusively vested in either the President or the Parliament,

but is a power that is unique and is sui generis in the sense that it is vested jointly in

the Parliament and the President. It is important to note the context in which Justice

Marsoof has made that observation. Justice Marsoof has observed that the power of

impeachment is sui generis as it is jointly vested in the Parliament and the President.

It is pertinent to observe that Justice Maroof has not held that the power vested in

the President with regard to impeachment of a Judge is ‘executive power’. Nor has he

held that such power forms a separate category of power vested in the President

which is beyond judicial review by the Supreme Court. What his Lordship has

concluded is that the relevant power is unique and thus it is sui generis.

554. Athula Chandraguptha Thenuwara and Others vs. Chamal Rajapaksa, Speaker

of Parliament and Others (cited above), also relates substantially to the same matter

which had led to the filing of the above-mentioned Application. However, the factual

circumstances pre-dates the facts of the earlier case. The related fundamental rights

Application had been filed in the wake of the presentation to the Honourable Speaker

of Parliament (1st Respondent), a Notice of Resolution for the removal of the 43rd Chief

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 244 of 306

Justice of Sri Lanka Dr. Upathissa Atapattu Bandaranayke Wasala Mudiyanse

Ralahamilage Shirani Anshumala Bandaranayake. That Resolution had been

purportedly under Article 107(2) and (3) of the Constitution read with Order 78A of

the Standing Orders of Parliament. Dr. Bandaranayake was the Petitioner before the

Court of Appeal in the earlier matter, who sought inter alia a writ of certiorari to quash

the findings of a Parliamentary Select Committee and a corresponding purported

Resolution adopted by Parliament recommending to the President her removal from

office of Chief Justice.

555. In Athula Chandraguptha Thenuwara and Others, a preliminary objection had been

raised regarding the maintainability of the Application filed by the Petitioner on the

premise that the impugned action did not amount to ‘executive or administrative

action’ for the purposes of Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution. Learned

Attorney-General in support of the preliminary objection raised had argued that the

procedure for the impeachment of the Chief Justice, a Judge of the Supreme Court,

etc. was sui generis, and was intended to satisfy two fundamental objectives, namely

the independence of the Judiciary and judicial accountability, both equally important

in the constitutional scheme. It had also been submitted that the powers of Parliament

for the impeachment of the President, the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme

Court and Court of Appeal, are not executive or judicial in character, and such power

stand on its own. In response, Justice Saleem Marsoof, PC had once again (in this

judgment too) concluded that the power of Parliament with regard to the acceptance

of a Resolution for the impeachment of the Chief Justice and the appointment of a

Select Committee is an integral part of a sui generis function of Parliament which did

not fit easily into the legislative, executive or judicial spheres of government, and bore

a unique complexion in that, while being more disciplinary in nature, it could not be

exercised by Parliament alone and had to be performed in concurrence with the

President of Sri Lanka, as contemplated by Article 107(2) and (3) of the Constitution.

Nevertheless, for reasons stated in his judgment, Justice Marsoof has proceeded to

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 245 of 306

hold that that the impugned act of the Honourable Speaker of the Parliament to

appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee was indeed “executive or administrative

action” within the meaning of Article 126 of the Constitution.

556. It would thus be seen that these two judgments of a Divisional Bench of this Court

sets precedence for the recognition of the principle that certain functions and

associated powers vested in the Parliament and in the President are unique in nature,

in that they do not fall squarely into the classification of legislative, executive and

judicial functions. Their unique nature is strengthened by the fact that, the processes

contemplated therein cannot be performed independently and exclusively by either

the Parliament or the President. As submitted by the learned ASG, a partnership and

cooperative approach are required for the fulfilment of the function, and thus, they

may be quite rightly referred to as ‘sui generis’, because such functions do not fit into

the classical definition of legislative, executive and judicial functions. Nor do such

powers readily and exclusively fit into either Article 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c) of the

Constitution.

557. For the purposes of this judgment, it would not be necessary for me to arrive at a

finding as to the exact character or classification of the function vested in Parliament

and the President to cause the impeachment of the Chief Justice, a Judge of the

Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and any other Judge of the Court

of Appeal. However, it is observable from the afore-stated judgments of Justice

Marsoof, that he has not accepted the submission that by virtue of a particular

function and associated power being recognized as ‘sui generis’, such function and

power necessarily and automatically fall outside the ambit of ‘executive or

administrative action’ for the purposes of Article 17 read with 126 of the Constitution.

It is to be noted that in Rajavarothiam Sampanthan and Others v AG (cited above),

the only purpose for which the case of Thenuwara and Others v Chamal Rajapakse,

Speaker of Parliament and Others (cited above) had been cited, has been to describe

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 246 of 306

what amounts to ‘executive or administrative acts’ as falling within Article 126. The

Court in that matter, has not discussed whether the President is possessed with sui

generis powers. Upon applying the rationale expounded by this Court in several

decisions, including the decision in Thenuwara and Others v Chamal Rajapakse,

Speaker of Parliament and Others (cited above), the Court has concluded that the

functions and powers vested in the President under Article 33(2) (then) of the

Constitution should only be regarded as executive functions and powers of the

President. It was held that “while the President may when exercising those powers be

doing so qua Head of State in a historical sense, any such flavour of acting as Head of

State does not detract from the core feature that the President is exercising

executive powers”. [Emphasis added]

558. Therefore, it is to be noted that none of the above-mentioned judgments make any

reference to the power of the President to be exercised under Article 34. However,

certain functions and powers contained in the Constitution vested in the President,

the Parliament and in the Judiciary, may not fall within the classical definition of

executive, legislative or judicial power. Furthermore, certain functions vested in the

three organs of the state may contain different elements of executive, legislative and

judicial power, some to be exercised alone and some to be exercised cooperatively by

more than one organ of the state. Nevertheless, what is necessary to be examined

and determined is whether the power vested in the President by Article 34 to grant a

pardon is one such sui generis power which neither falls within the ambit of Article

4(b) of the Constitution (‘executive power’ of the People), nor within the ambit of

Article 4(c) of the Constitution (‘judicial power’ of the People). The objective of doing

that would be to determine whether the exercise of the power conferred on the

President by Article 34 (the power of pardon), would fall within the scope of ‘executive

or administrative action’ for the purpose of Article 17 read with Article 126 of the

Constitution.

559. Before I proceed to analyse what constitutes an ‘executive or administrative action’, I

shall in brief, consider the nature of ‘executive power’.

560. In this regard, in his treatise titled “Constitutional and Administrative Law of Sri

Lanka” (Sumathi Publishers, 1995, at page 164), Dr. Joseph A.L. Cooray has observed

the following:

“It is not possible to give an exact definition of ‘executive power’. Ordinarily it

connotes the residual governmental function that remain after the legislative and

judicial functions are taken away, subject of course to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any other law. Executive power is not confined to the mere

execution of laws. It includes the determination and execution of policy, the

initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion of economic and

social welfare, the direction of foreign policy, and the conduct of military

operations.”

561. In the Journal article titled ‘Inherent Executive Power: A Comparative Perspective’,

published in the Yale Law Journal (vol.115, no. 9, 2006), Assistant Professor Jenny

Martinez of the Stanford Law School, has observed that the most striking feature of

executive power found in all legal systems is that executive power is not fixed or

determinate, but instead, has evolved over time. She has opined that “the scope of

‘executive or administrative action’ within each system, and the exercise of such power

has fluctuated greatly, with the actual distribution of the scope of ‘executive or

administrative power’ at any given moment shaped by social and political

circumstances, as well as the letter of the Constitution.” Moreover, the comparative

study conducted by Professor Martinez acknowledges the fact that contemporary

democracies have recognized legal or constitutional limits on executive power, in

order to preserve a balance of political power with the legislature and courts, even in

matters touching on war, foreign affairs, and national security.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 248 of 306

562. Dr. Durga Das Basu, in the Chapter on ‘The Executive’ in his treatise titled

‘Constitutional Law of India’ (sixth edition, 1991, at page 136), has opined that “it

may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means

and implies”. Further, he has expressed the following view:

“…Ordinarily, the executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions

that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away, subject of

course, to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law…

The executive function comprises both the determination of policy as well as

carrying it into execution, the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order,

the promotion of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy; in

fact, the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the state. It

includes political and diplomatic activities…”

563. Thus, it is seen that though it is not possible to precisely define what executive power

is, executive power is what is vested in the Executive organ of government, that is

mainly responsible for the formulation of policy for the governance of the state,

implementation of policy which can be directly given effect to, initiation of legislation

(development of the policy and legal framework) by which policy is to be converted

into legislation, and execution (or enforcement) of laws. Executive action is not limited

to the mere execution of laws and taking decisions and action founded upon powers

conferred on officials by law, but also extends to powers relating to the protection of

national security such as by declaration of and waging war, command and direction

of the armed forces, conduct of international and multilateral relations by making of

treaties, engaging in foreign relations, appointment of ambassadors, and debate,

decision-making and voting in international organizations. Executive power includes

the appointment of judges as provided in the Constitution, and the making of certain

appointments such as Heads of public institutions, all of which are different forms of

the exercise of executive power.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 249 of 306

564. Article 17 read with Article 126(1) of the Constitution entitles any person to apply to

the Supreme Court in respect of an infringement or imminent infringement of a

fundamental right by executive or administrative action. However, the Constitution

has not, in its own wisdom, defined or described what is meant by ‘executive or

administrative action’. The jurisprudence of this Court in understanding the scope of

that phrase is indeed helpful.

565. As to what amounts to ‘executive and administrative action’ has been described by

Justice Sharvananda in the case of Rienzie Perera and Another v University Grants

Commission [(1978-79-80) 1 Sri L R 128] in the following manner:

“Constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights are directed against the State

and its organs. Only infringement or imminent infringement by executive or

administrative action of any fundamental right or language right can form the

subject matter of a complaint under Article 126 of the Constitution. The wrongful

act of any individual, unsupported by State authority is simply a private wrong.

Only if it is sanctioned by the State or done by State authority, does it constitute

a matter for complaint under Article 126. Fundamental rights operate only

between individuals and the State. In the context of fundamental rights, the

‘State’ includes every repository of State power. The expression ‘executive

or administrative action’ embraces executive action of the State or its

agencies or instrumentalities exercising governmental functions. It refers

to exertion of State power in all forms…” [Emphasis added.]

566. In a similar vein, Justice Sharvananda in the case of Wijetunga v Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation [(1982) 1 Sri L R 1], has expressed the following view:

“All organs of government are mandated to respect the fundamental rights

referred to in Chap. 3 of the Constitution and are prohibited from infringing the

same. Actions by the organs of the government alone constitutes the executive or

administrative action that is a sine qua non or basis to proceedings under Article

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 250 of 306

126. The term ‘executive action’ comprehends official actions of all government

officers … When private individuals or groups are endowed by the State with

power or functions, governmental in nature, they become agencies or

instrumentalities of the state subject to the constitutional inhibitions of the state.”

567. In Parameswary Jayathevan v Attorney-General and Others [(1992) 2 Sri L R 356],

Justice Kulatunga has described ‘executive or administrative action’ as “acts done

under the colour of office in the exercise or the purported exercise of governmental

functions”.

568. In Faiz v Attorney General and Others [(1995) 1 Sri L R 372], Justice Mark Fernando

has adverted to the phrase ‘executive and administrative action’ as used in Article 126,

in the following manner:

“The phrase does not seek to draw a distinction between the acts of ‘high’ officials

(as being ‘executive’), and other officials (as being ‘administrative’). ‘Executive’ is

appropriate in a Constitution, and sufficient to include the official acts of all public

officers, high and low, and to exclude acts which are plainly legislative or judicial

and of course purely private acts not done under the colour of office. The need

for including ‘administrative’ is because there are residual acts which do

not fit neatly into this three-fold classification. Thus, it may be uncertain

whether delegated legislation is ‘legislative’ and therefore, outside the scope of

Article 126. … Thus, ‘administrative’ is intended to enlarge the category of

acts within the scope of Article 126; it serves to emphasize that what is

excluded from Article 126 are only acts which are legislative or judicial,

either intrinsically or upon the application of a historical test… .” [Emphasis

added.]

569. In Pinnawala v Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others [(1997) 3 Sri L R

85], Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva has expressed the following view:

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 251 of 306

“The expression ‘executive or administrative action’ has not been defined in our

Constitution. It excludes the exercise of the special jurisdiction of this court under

Article 126 in respect of the acts of the legislature or the judiciary. Article 4 of the

Constitution mandates that the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III ‘shall be

respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of the government’. An

examination of our decisions indicate that this expression embraces actions not

only of the government itself, but also of organs, instrumentalities or agencies of

the government. … In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the expression

‘executive or administrative action’ in Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution

should be given a broad and not a restrictive construction … .”

570. In addition, this Court in Rajavarothiam Sampanthan v Attorney-General (cited

above), has held that the question of whether an act or omission can be regarded as

constituting ‘executive or administrative action’ must be decided by a consideration

of the nature of the power that is exercised, the nature of the act and the facts of each

case. On a consideration of the powers vested in the Executive by the Constitution

and the views expressed by Judges of this Court (as contained in the above

judgments), I find myself in agreement with the view of the learned ASG that there

are indeed, certain acts of public officers, which may not be referred to purely as

‘executive’, ‘legislative’ or ‘judicial’. However, in my view, it cannot be presumed that

all such acts which do not fit neatly into the classical categorization as executive,

legislative or judicial acts are exempted from the scope of Article 126, and have been

kept out of scrutiny by this Court. Such an interpretation would not be in favour of

constitutionalism and the rule of law. It would considerably narrow down the scope

of Article 126, and thus would defeat the mechanism for the protection of

fundamental rights as contained in the Constitution. In my view, the residual acts of

all state functionaries, may they be holding positions within the legislative, executive

and judicial branches of the state, which do not fit into the classical three-fold

classification and are not actions of public nature, , are what is referred to in Article

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 252 of 306

126 as ‘administrative acts’. What is excluded from Article 126 are only acts which are

‘judicial’ or legislative’. This lends support to my view, that despite the fact that

certain powers conferred by law on the Executive may be identified as sui

generis, and thus, are not classically executive, legislative or judicial in nature,

the exercise of such powers are very much within the scope of Article 126 and

thus judicially reviewable under the jurisdiction vested in this Court by Article

126 read with Article 17 of the Constitution.

571. The grant of a pardon is considered once the judicial response to crime has been

concluded, and the convict remains under the control of the Executive for the

management of his penal sanctions (punishment). It is a power that is conferred on

the President, who is vested with the executive power of the People. Furthermore, the

provisions relating to the grant of a pardon is found in ‘Chapter VII – The Executive’

which specifically lays down the provisions relating to the ‘President of the Republic’.

572. It is also to be noted that the exercise of the power of pardon by no means alters the

judicial record. The judicial record remains unchanged, and the conviction stands

notwithstanding the grant of a pardon. Thus, the power to grant a pardon only has

the effect of reducing or removing the punishment imposed on the victim. In other

words, the grant of a pardon only affects the execution of the sentence imposed on

the convict. The execution of a sentence is an executive act.

573. In Sarat Chandra Rabha and Others v Khagendranath Nath and Others [(1961)

AIR SC 334], the following view has been expressed by the Supreme Court of India, as

regards the power of the President to remit a sentence, which is a form of the exercise

of the power of pardon:

“… An order of remission thus, does not in any way interfere with the order of the

court; it affects only the execution of the sentence passed by the court and

frees the convicted person from his liability to undergo the full term of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 253 of 306

imprisonment inflicted by the court, though the order of conviction and

sentence passed by the court stands still as it was. The power to grant

remission is executive power and cannot have the effect which the order of an

appellate or revisional court would have of reducing the sentence passed by the

trial court and substituting in its place the reduced sentence adjudged by the

appellate or revisional court…” [Emphasis added.]

574. The court also cited the following passage from Weater’s Constitutional Law on the

effect of reprieves and pardons in comparison with a judgment passed by a court, to

demonstrate that power of pardon is an executive power:

“A reprieve is a temporary suspension of the punishment fixed by law. A pardon

is the remission of such punishment. Both are the exercise of executive

functions and should be distinguished from the exercise of judicial power over

sentences. The judicial power and the executive power over sentences are readily

distinguishable. To render a judgment is a judicial function. To carry out the

judgment into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an

act of clemency is an exercise of executive power which abridges the

enforcement of the judgment but does not alter it qua judgment.”

[Emphasis added.]

575. The above-stated view has been followed in the case of Maru Ram v Union of India

[(1980) AIR 2147]. In Kehar Singh v Union of India (cited above), the Supreme Court

of India has, in distinguishing between the executive power and the judicial power in

the exercise of the power of pardon, expressed the following view:

“We are of the view that it is open to the President in the exercise of the power

vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to scrutinize the evidence on the

record of the criminal case and come to a different conclusion from that recorded

by the court in regard to the guilt of and sentence imposed on the accused. In

doing so, the President does not amend or modify or supersede the judicial record.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 254 of 306

The judicial record remains intact, and undisturbed. The President acts in a

wholly different plane from that in which the Court acted. He acts under a

constitutional power, the nature of which is entirely different from judicial

power and cannot be regarded as an extension of it. And this is so,

notwithstanding that the practical effect of the Presidential act is to remove the

stigma of guilt from the accused or to remit the sentence imposed on him…”

[Emphasis added.]

576. Therefore, it was held that the legal effect of a pardon is wholly different from a judicial

supersession of the original sentence and that it is the nature of the power which is

determinative. Moreover, in determining whether the petitioner is entitled to a

hearing by the President under Article 72, it was held that “the proceeding before the

President is of an executive character” and therefore, it is for the petitioner to submit

all requisite information necessary for the disposal of the petition.

577. In Epuru Sudhakar v Union of India [(2006) AIR SC 3385], the Supreme Court of India

was of the view that ‘executive clemency’ is administered by the executive branch of

the government in the interests of the society and the discipline, education and

reformation of the person convicted.

578. In the case of United States v Wilson [32 US (7 Pet.) 150 (1833)] as regards the power

of pardon, the Supreme Court of the United States of America has held a follows:

“The Constitution gives to the President, in general terms, ‘the power to grant

reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States’. As this power had

been exercised from time immemorial, by the executive of that nation whose

language is our language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear

resemblance; we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a

pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it

is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it…

A pardon is an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the

execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed,

from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed.” [Emphasis

added.]

579. Thus, due to the following reasons, I am unable to agree with the submission of the

learned ASG that the power vested in the President under Article 34 is a sui generis

power, which is neither executive, legislative or judicial, or that it contains a unique

combination of such powers.

(i) The power vested in the President by Article 34 is not legislative power, as

the exercise of the power to grant a pardon does not result in the creation of

rights, duties, prohibitions, stipulation of sanctions, institutions or enforceable

procedure.

(ii) The power vested in the President by Article 34 is not judicial power, as the

exercise of the power to grant a pardon does not contain the character of

judicial adjudication, as it is not a process which results in the stipulation of the

applicable law, and the settlement of rights and duties of parties to a dispute.

(iii) As the power vested in the President by Article 34 is neither legislative nor

judicial power, and as the (a) power to grant a pardon has been conferred by

the Constitution on the President (who is the head of the Executive branch of

the state), (b) power to grant a pardon is to be exercised after the judicial

process has been completed, (c) exercise of the power has a bearing on the

rights and interests of persons, and (d) power is associated with the official

functioning of the President who is the Head of the Executive branch of the

state, such power is clearly executive power.

580. I wish to also note a fallacy in the learned ASG’s submission that the power to grant a

pardon is a sui generis power, which is outside the scope of Articles 17 and 126 of the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 256 of 306

Constitution, as it is neither ‘executive or administrative action’. The learned ASG has

throughout his submissions rightfully maintained the position that this Court is

entitled in these proceedings to judicially review the impugned decision to grant a

pardon to the 2nd Respondent, on the legal criteria of procedural regularity. In fact, he

indirectly admitted that the impugned decision is unlawful, as it has been taken in

contravention with the mandatory procedure prescribed in the proviso to Article 34.

He thereby concedes that the impugned decision comes within the scope of Articles

17 and 126 of the Constitution.

581. In view of the foregoing, I hold that the power conferred on the President by Article

34 of the Constitution to grant a pardon, respite, etc. is not a sui generis power.

It is ‘executive power’ which comes within the ambit of Article 4(b) of the

Constitution, and for the purposes of Articles 17 read with 126 of the

Constitution the exercise of such power amounts to ‘executive action’.

582. Therefore, and for other reasons set out in this judgment, I hold that the

impugned decision to grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent which has been

taken by the President (11A Respondent) acting purportedly under Article 34 of

the Constitution, is amenable to judicial review through the jurisdiction invoked

by the Petitioner, that being the ‘Fundamental Rights jurisdiction’ of this Court.

583. Further, I hold that, due to the reasons set-out in this part of the judgment, when

judicially reviewing a decision of the President to grant a pardon to a person

convicted of having committed an offence, this Court may consider not only

whether the President had acted in terms of the procedure laid down in the

proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution, but, it would be within the

jurisdiction of the Court to additionally consider the lawfulness of the impugned

decision based on the merits of the decision.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 257 of 306

584. Thus, it would be lawful and appropriate for this Court to judicially review the

merits of the decision taken by the 11A Respondent to grant a purported pardon

to the 2nd Respondent, founded upon legal standards and criteria generally

applicable to the review of executive and administrative action, such as

objectivity and good-faith, reasonableness, non-arbitrariness, and

proportionality.

Effect of non-compliance with section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of

Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act.

585. During the course of the hearing, learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that, in terms of section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims

of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 (hereinafter referred to as Act No. 4 of 2015

or as the ‘Victims of Crime and Witnesses Protection Act’), the 11A Respondent (then

President), when considering the grant of a Pardon to the 2nd Respondent, was

required to afford an opportunity to the 9th and 10th Respondents (members of the

family of the deceased victim) to express their views regarding the grant of a pardon

to the 2nd Respondent. Learned President’s Counsel complained that the 11A

Respondent when granting the purported pardon had not complied with that

requirement, which in addition to the earlier mentioned grounds pertaining to

procedural irregularity and unlawfulness on the merits of the decision, makes the

impugned grant of the pardon contrary to law and thus unlawful.

586. Learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents - Dr. Romesh De Silva,

PC also submitted that, the 11A Respondent had acted in violation of section 3(q) of

Act No. 4 of 2015. He submitted that by virtue of the definition of the term ‘victim of

crime’ contained in section 46 of Act No. 4 of 2015, the 9th and 10th Respondents

being respectively the father and the sister of the deceased, were each deemed to be

a ‘victim of crime’ in respect of the offence of ‘murder’ committed by the 2nd

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 258 of 306

Respondent. Thus, at the stage the 11A Respondent was considering the grant of a

pardon to the 2nd Respondent, they had the right in terms of section 3(q) of the

Victims of Crime and Witnesses Protection Act to have received notice thereof, and

further, they had the right to be afforded an opportunity to submit to the President

(11A Respondent) information regarding the manner in which the offence committed

by the 2nd Respondent has impacted on their lives. Learned President’s Counsel

submitted that his clients, the 9th and 10th Respondents had not been afforded that

opportunity, and thus, the 11A Respondent had failed to respect the right of the 9th

and 10th Respondents conferred on them by section 3(q) of the Victims of Crime

Witnesses Protection Act. He further submitted that such infringement of the right of

the 9th and 10th Respondents was an additional factor which supports his contention

that the 9th and 10th Respondents have been denied the equal protection of the law

and thus their fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) has been violated by the

11A Respondent.

587. A perusal of the documents pertaining to the grant of both the 1st and the 2nd pardons

(the first pardon being a commutation of the sentence), reveal clearly that the 11A

Respondent had not complied with the requirement contained in section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015. The 11A Respondent in both of his affidavits filed in this matter, does

not claim that he complied with section 3(q). Even in his submissions, learned

President’s Counsel for the 11A Respondent did not did take up the position that the

11A Respondent complied with the requirement contained in section 3(q) of the

Victims of Crime and Witnesses Protection Act. Thus, the position taken up by the 9th

and 10th Respondents remains uncontradicted. Therefore, I conclude that the

complaint of the Petitioner and the 9th and 10th Respondents that the corresponding

victims of crime were not afforded an opportunity by the 11A Respondent to exercise

their right in terms of section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 is well-founded and correct.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 259 of 306

588. Learned President’s Counsel for the 11A Respondent also did not venture to explain

why the 11A Respondent did not comply with the requirement contained in section

3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015. Nor did learned President’s Counsel present to this Court

any legal submission seeking to justify non-compliance with section 3(q) of Act No. 4

of 2015.

589. Learned ASG on behalf of the 1st, 3rd to 6th Respondents made extensive submissions

in this regard. His submissions on this aspect were two-fold. First, his position was that

the constitutional responsibilities of the President under the proviso to Article 34(1)

of the Constitution could not have been amended or modified by section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015. He submitted that it is a well-recognized principle that procedures

specified by the Constitution cannot be implicitly amended or modified by legislation

(‘ordinary legislation’) and or by subordinate legislation. In support of his position,

learned ASG cited views of Court in the cases of Migultenne v the Attorney General

[(1996) 1 Sri L R 408], Southern Provincial Co-operative Employees Service

Commission v Bentota Multi-Purpose Co-Operative Society Ltd. and Others

[CA/PHC/71/2013, CA Minutes of 09.08.2018], and Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka v Hiniduma Dahanayakage Siripala alias Kiri Mahaththaya and

Others [SC Appeal 115/2014, SC Minutes of 22.01.2020]. He submitted that the

procedure to be followed when granting a pardon to an offender who has been

condemned to suffer death by the sentence of any court, is stipulated in the proviso

of Article 34(1), and no law could amend any provision contained in the Constitution

except by an amendment to the same. It was his position that if section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015 is to be interpreted so as to include an ‘additional step’ to the procedure

provided in the proviso to Article 34(1), such interpretation is contrary to the

Constitution, as such interpretation seeks to amend the proviso to Article 34(1).

Secondly, he submitted that Article 84 of the Constitution reflects the legal position

that a Bill inconsistent with the Constitution that is subsequently passed into law,

notwithstanding the inconsistency, does not have the effect of amending, repealing

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 260 of 306

or replacing the Constitution or any provision of the Constitution and should not be

interpreted or construed in such manner. Learned ASG submitted that Section 3(q) of

the Victims and Witnesses Protection Act was ex facie inconsistent with Article 34 of

the Constitution. However, the corresponding Bill had been passed notwithstanding

such inconsistency. By virtue of Articles 84(1) and 84(3) of the Constitution, Act No. 4

of 2015 does not have the effect of amending, repealing or replacing the Constitution

or any provision of the Constitution. He asserted that the interpretation provided by

the 9th and 10th Respondents amends or modifies the constitutional provisions and

hence is, unconstitutional. He urged therefore, that this Court reject such

interpretation. Learned ASG submitted that while section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015

was immune from challenge by virtue of Article 80(3), this Court has held that the

Constitution is the higher norm and therefore, the Constitutional provision must

supersede any prima facie inconsistent statutory provision [vide Cooray v

Bandaranayake [(1999) 1 Sri L R 1]; Gamage v Perera [(2006) 3 Sri L R 354]; and

Southern Provincial Co-Operative Employees Service Commission v Bentota

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd and Others (CA/PHC/71/2013, CA Minutes

of 09.08.2018)].

590. In conclusion, learned ASG submitted that the constitutionally mandated procedure

to grant a pardon to a convict in the death row cannot be implicitly modified by the

provisions of section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015, and that failure on the part of the

President (pardoning authority) to follow the procedure laid down in section 3(q) of

Act No. 4 of 2015 does not vitiate the legality of the impugned pardon. Accordingly,

he submitted that section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 must be interpreted by this Court

to be ‘directory’ rather than ‘mandatory’, and to be not inconsistent with the

Constitution.

591. I agree with learned ASG that in terms of Article 84(3) of the Constitution,

constitutional procedure cannot be directly or implicitly amended or modified by

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 261 of 306

legislation (legislation which is not an ‘amendment to the Constitution’) and or by

subordinate legislation. However, it is necessary to note that once a Bill is enacted by

Parliament, its provisions must be respected and given effect to in a manner that is

not inconsistent with provisions of the Constitution.

592. I shall briefly consider some of the cases cited by the learned ASG in this regard.

Migultenne v the Attorney General [(1996) 1 Sri L R 408] involved the interpretation

of sections 106 and 107 of the first Republican (1972) Constitution. In that case, the

Court held that subordinate legislation which is made under the provisions of the

Constitution cannot override a constitutional provision. In Southern Provincial Co-

Operative Employees Service Commission v Bentota Multi-Purpose Co-Operative

Society Ltd and Others [CA/PHC/71/2013, CA Minutes of 09.08.2018], the issue inter

alia which had to be determined was whether there is a conflict between section 1 of

the Southern Provincial Co-operative Employees Service Commission Statute No. 1 of

1998 (a statute enacted by the Southern Provincial Council) and Article 154H of the

Constitution. The Court in that case observed that “the first question that arises for

determination is whether there is in fact a conflict between these two provisions, and if

so, which provision prevails. … If there is indeed a conflict, clearly the constitutional

provision prevails as the Grundnorm in the sense propounded by Kelson…”. In

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka v Hiniduma Dahanayakage Siripala

alias Kiri Mahaththaya and Others [SC Appeal 115/2014, SC Minutes of 22.01.2020],

the issue to be determined was whether non-compliance with section 196 of the CCPA

would vitiate a conviction. The Court observed that many cases have overlooked the

effect of Article 138(1) of the Constitution. The following observation was made in

that case:

“The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms and the burden is on the

party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned error, defect or

irregularity has either prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or has

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 262 of 306

occasioned a failure of justice. … The Constitutional provision embedded in Article

138(1) cannot be overlooked and must be given effect to. None of the decisions

(made after 1978) relied upon by the Appellants with regard to the issue that this

court is now called upon to decide, appear to have considered the constitutional

provision in the proviso to Article 138(1). It is a well-established canon of

interpretation, that the Constitution overrides a statute as a grundnorm. All

statutes must be construed in line with the highest law…”

593. Thus, it is observable that in the judgments cited by the learned ASG, the impugned

statutory provision or subordinate legislation was found to be inconsistent with a

constitutional provision. In other words, both the statutory provision and the

constitutional provision could not be given effect to parallelly, or the statutory

provision could not be given effect to without rendering a constitutional provision

nugatory or revised. In such instances, this Court has held that certainly the

constitutional provision must prevail. I have no doubt regarding the views expressed

by Court relating to that principle. However, in my view, the instant situation is

different.

594. Section 3 and in particular sub-section (q) of section 3 of Act No. 4 of 2015 provides

as follows:

“3. A victim of crime shall have the right:-

(a) …

(b) …

…

(q) in the event of any person in authority considering the grant of a pardon or

remission of sentence imposed on any person convicted of having committed an

offence, to receive notice thereof and submit through the Authority to the person

granting such pardon or remission, the manner in which the offence committed

had impacted on his life including his body, state of mind, employment, profession

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 263 of 306

or occupation, income, quality of life, property and any other aspects concerning

his life.”

595. I am mindful of the recent repeal of Act No. 4 of 2015 and the replacement thereof

by Act No. 10 of 2023. Section 5(1)(f) of Act No. 10 of 2023 confers on a victim of

crime the identical right. In any event, in view of the fact that the grant of the pardon

by the President in the instant matter has preceded the enactment of Act No. 10 of

2023, I shall confine my views in this regard, to section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015.

However, they do equally apply to compliance with section 5(1)(f) of Act No. 10 of

2023 as well.

596. A consideration of section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 reveals that it applies to an

instance of grant of a pardon, respite, substitute a less severe form of punishment or

remission of sentence to a person who has been convicted of any offence. Thus,

section 3(q) applies not only to a convict condemned to suffer death by a court of law

(in which situation the proviso to Article 34(1) shall apply), but also to any person

convicted for any offence. Thus, the application of section 3(q) relates to all persons

convicted of having committed any offence, and the President considers the exercise

of the power of pardon in such person’s favour.

597. The right conferred on a victim of crime by section 3(q), is for him to receive ‘notice’

of the intended consideration of a pardon to the corresponding convict, and an

opportunity to him to through the National Authority for the Assistance and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses to ‘submit the manner in which the

offence committed has impacted on his life including his body, state of mind,

employment, profession or occupation, income, quality of life, property and any other

aspects concerning his life’.

598. It would thus be seen that, with regard to situations where the Article 34(1) does apply,

section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 does not repeal, amend or otherwise vary the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 264 of 306

requisite procedure contained in the said proviso. Article 34(1) of the Constitution

confers on the President discretionary authority. The scope of such discretionary

authority is not narrowed down, broadened or otherwise varied by section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015. Furthermore, Article 34(1) confers on the President the power to grant

a pardon, respite, substitute a less severe form of punishment, or remission. Section

3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015, neither reduces or enhances such power. Nor does it place

any bar or impediment on the exercise of such power. Furthermore, section 3(q) does

not alter in any manner the purpose for which the power conferred on the President

by Article 34(1) may be exercised. Thus, section 3(q) does not directly or otherwise

repeal, amend, or otherwise vary Article 34(1) of the Constitution. The right conferred

on a victim of crime by section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 can be respected and given

effect to, in a manner that does not interfere with the exercise of the power conferred

on the President by Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

599. Section 3(q) merely places a statutory duty on the President (the ‘pardoning

authority’) to give notice to a victim of crime of his intention of exercising his power

under Article 34(1). That has no bearing on the procedural scheme contained in the

proviso to Article 34(1).

600. It is necessary to note that the powers and functions of the President are not only

found in the Constitution, but also in the ordinary written law as well. This is evident

by the wording in Article 33 which begins with the words “In addition to the powers

and functions expressly conferred on or assigned to him by the Constitution or by any

written law, …”. [Emphasis added.] Thus, it cannot be said that section 3(q) is

inconsistent with the provisions in Article 34(1). Where two sources of law provide for

the same subject matter, and where one source is the higher law, and where no

inconsistency exist, the Court must give both provisions a purposive and a harmonious

interpretation.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 265 of 306

601. In this regard, the following views of Justice Surasena, in Hirunika Eranjali

Premachandra and Another v Hon. Attorney General and Others (cited above) are

noteworthy:

“I agree that the provisions of the Constitution must prevail over the provisions of

any general law. The question as to which prevails, whether the provisions in the

Constitution or the provisions in the general law, would arise only when they are

in conflict with each other. In this situation I see no conflict between the provisions

in Article 34 and section 3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses Act. I see no impossibility; no impediment; no contradiction

between those two provisions. They certainly can co-exist together. Thus, I am

unable to accept the above argument as a justification for the former President’s

non-compliance / complete ignorance of the provisions in section 3(q) of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act.”

602. Further, Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act is an Act duly enacted by the Parliament

exercising the legislative power of the People. This Court is bound to give effect to

the legislation enacted by Parliament, keeping in mind its intention in enacting the

relevant legislation. As held by Justice Surasena in the above-stated case, Article 33(h)

of the Constitution “calls upon the President not to do acts and things which would be

inconsistent with the provisions of not only the Constitution or written law, but also

international customs or usage”. I am in agreement with the observations made by His

Lordship.

603. Thus, I am of the view that s. 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015 is not inconsistent with

procedure laid down in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution.

604. Thus, I conclude that on the impugned occasion, the 11A Respondent was obliged

to recognize and give effect to the right of the 9th and 10th Respondents

conferred on them by section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015. The 11A Respondent

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 266 of 306

when granting the impugned pardon has acted contrary to section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015.

605. I must add that it is necessary to note the importance of the existence of a law to

protect victims of crime and witnesses. Victims of crime suffer twice: for the first time

when they are subjected to criminality (primary victimization); for the second time

when they are required to participate in the criminal justice system (secondary

victimization). Right from the beginning of the process of criminal justice, up till the

end of the process when criminal proceedings finally come to an end, victims of crime

suffer psychological trauma in addition to direct harm emanating from being

subjected to criminality. The situation of witnesses is no different. Both these

categories are highly susceptible and vulnerable to threats, intimidation, harassment,

reprisals and retaliation.

606. The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of

2015 is a giant stride taken by Parliament to protect and provide for rights and

entitlements to victims and witnesses of crimes. Thus, this piece of legislation, cannot

be discarded as just an ordinary law which need not be considered by the President

of the country. The pardoning process is an even more important instance where the

President is bound by the law to give notice of his decision to exercise the power of

pardon, to those who would directly be affected by the pardoning of the convict: in

this case, the 9th and 10th Respondents and the mother of the deceased. After giving

such notice, the duty cast on the President by section 3(q) is to inter alia, consider the

views of the victims of crime (in this case the 9th and 10th Respondents and the mother

of the deceased) as regards how the commission of the murder of Yvonne Johnson

has impacted on their lives including their state of mind. Dr. Romesh De Silva, PC

enlightened court briefly on how the lives of the 9th and 10th Respondents and the

mother of the deceased has been shattered beyond any repair, and how the grant of

the impugned pardon to the 2nd Respondent without any advance notice to them and

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 267 of 306

the President not having given them an opportunity to express their views regarding

the intended pardon has left them dumbfounded and in utter shock and dismay. The

9th and 10th Respondents now feel that they have been victimized not once or twice,

but thrice - the third time due to the grant of a pardon to the 2nd Respondent.

607. Furthermore, affording victims of crime, notice of the consideration being given to

grant a pardon, giving them an opportunity to express views, and objectively

considering inter alia the views of victims of crime, should be recognized as a common

law requirement associated with the right to a fair hearing when exercising

discretionary authority resulting in power being exercised which has the potential of

affecting the interests of such parties (victims of crime).

608. In view of the foregoing reasoning, I conclude that, in the impugned occasion non-

compliance by the 11A Respondent with section 3(q) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 is an additional

ground that vitiates the legality of a pardon that has been granted in favour of

the 2nd Respondent purportedly in accordance with Article 34(1) of the

Constitution.

Unlawful actions, violations of the Rule of Law and Article 12(1) of the

Constitution

609. Learned ASG submitted that ‘not every wrong decision or breach of the law amounts

to a violation of a fundamental right and the reliefs available under Article 126 of the

Constitution’. In that regard, he cited the case of Wijesinghe v Attorney General and

Others [(1978-79-80) 1 Sri L R 102]. He submitted that ‘in the absence of any

intentional or purposeful discrimination evident from the record, this Court should be

cautious in exercising judicial review over executive pardons’.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 268 of 306

610. As explained in several previous judgments of this Court, a violation of the rule of law

should necessarily be recognized as an instance of an infringement of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution that confers equal protection of the law to all persons. It is well-

known that Article 12 is colloquially referred to as the ‘guardian of the rule of law’ as

the right to equality which is enshrined in Article 12 protects against infringement of

the rule of law. [See among others Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority [SC FR

256/2017, SC Minutes of 11.12.2020]

611. In the early case of Elmore Perera v Major Montague Jayawickrema, Minister of

Public Administration, and Plantation Industries and others [(1985) 1 Sri L R 285]

Chief Justice Sharvananda, extensively described in the following manner what the

rule of law entails:

“Our Constitution is certainly founded on the Rule of Law. Administrative law is

the area where this principle is to be seen, especially, in active operation. The Rule

of Law has a number of meanings and corollaries. Its primary meaning is that

everything must be done according to law, no member of the Executive can

interfere with the liberty or property of a subject except on the condition that he

can support the legality of his action before a court of justice. Another meaning

of the Rule of Law is that it implies the absence of wide discretionary powers in

the government to encroach on personal liberty or private property rights or

freedom of contract and that officials and Ministers are responsible for their

unlawful acts to the ordinary courts, applying the ordinary principles of law and

that government should be conducted within a framework of recognized rules

and principles which restrict discretionary power. Absence of discretionary power

is thus kept in check. The Rule of Law requires that that the courts should prevent

such abuse. A third meaning of the Rule of Law is that disputes as to the legality

of acts of government are to be decided by judges who are wholly independent of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 269 of 306

the Executive. Another meaning is that law should be even handed between

government and citizen.

The principle of equality before the law embodied in Article 12 is a

necessary corollary to the high concept of the Rule of Law underlying the

Constitution. By virtue of this provision, the Supreme Court is enabled to review

and strike down any exercise of discretion by the Executive which exhibits

discrimination. … The Rule of Law which postulates equal subjection to the law,

requires the observance of the law in all cases.” [Emphasis added.]

612. In Priyangani v Nanayakkara and Others [(1996) 1 Sri L R 399], Justice Mark

Fernando, has held as follows:

“We are not concerned with contractual rights, but with the safeguards based

on the Rule of Law which Article 12 provide against the arbitrary and

unreasonable exercise of discretionary powers. Discretionary powers can

never be treated as absolute and unfettered unless there is compelling language;

when reposed in public functionaries, such powers are held in trust, to be used for

the benefit of the public, and for the purpose for which they have been conferred

not at the whim and fancy of officials, for political advantage or personal gain.”

[Emphasis added.]

613. In Vasudeva Nanayakkara v Choksy and Others [(2008) 1 Sri L R 134], Chief Justice

Sarath N. Silva has expressed the following view:

“Three well-established aspects of our Constitutional Law have to be stated in this

regard. They are:

1. That the Rule of Law is the basis of our Constitution … The Rule of Law

“postulates the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed

to the influence of arbitrary power. It excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 270 of 306

prerogative or wide discretionary authority on the art of the Government” (vide:

Law of the Constitution by A. Dicey – page 202) …

2. …

3. That there is a “positive component in the right to equality” guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution as decided in Senarath v Chandrika

Bandaranayake Kumaratunga and where the Executive being the custodian of

the People’s power act ultra vires and in derogation of the law and procedures

that are intended to safeguard the resources of the State, it is in the public interest

to implead such action before Court.” [Emphasis added.]

614. In Wijesekera and 14 others v Gamini Lokuge, Minister of Sports and Public

Recreation and 20 others [(2011) 2 Sri L R 329] Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane has

held that “the Rule of Law is and must be characterized with the principles of supremacy

of the law, the quality of the law, accountability to the law, legal certainty, procedure

and legal transparency, equal and open access to justice to all, irrespective of gender,

race, religion, class, creed, or other status”.

615. In the recently decided case of Rajavarothiam Sampanthan v Attorney General

(cited above), a Divisional Bench of this Court has observed that Article 12(1) of the

Constitution embraces the Rule of Law as well. In that regard, Chief Justice Nalin Perera

has expounded the following view:

“The Supreme Court has even extended the jurisprudence under Article

12(1) to encompass the protection of the Rule of Law. …Thus, I am unable to

agree with the submission that Article 12(1) of the Constitution recognizes

‘classification’ as the only basis for relief. In a Constitutional democracy where

three organs of the State exercise their power in trust of the People, it is a

misnomer to equate ‘Equal protection’ with ‘reasonable classification’. It would

clothe with immunity, a vast majority of executive and administrative acts that

are otherwise reviewable under the jurisdiction of Article 126. More pertinently, if

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 271 of 306

this Court were to deny relief merely on the basis that the Petitioners have failed

to establish ‘unequal treatment’, we would in fact be inviting the State to ‘equally

violate the law’. It is blasphemous and would strike at the very heart of Article

4(d) which mandates every organ of the State to “respect, secure and advance the

fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution”. Rule of Law dictates that

every act that is not sanctioned by the law and every act that violates the

law be struck down as illegal. It does not require positive discrimination or

unequal treatment. An act that is prohibited by the law receives no legitimacy

merely because it does not discriminate between people.” [Emphasis added.]

616. Further, in the Special Determination of the Supreme Court on the Special Goods

and Service Tax Bill [SC SD 01-09/2022], this Court has held the view that “absolute

and unfettered discretion being vested in an officer of the Executive is a recipe for (i)

unreasonable and arbitrary decision-making, (ii) abuse of power, (iii) corruption and (iv)

the roadway to depredation of the Rule of Law. On all such accounts, it results in an

infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution which guarantees equal protection of

the law”.

617. In view of the foregoing illustrative and clear pronouncements of this Court, I

hold that an executive or administrative action –

(a) which is in excess of the power conferred by law,

(b) which has been arrived at contrary to procedure established by law, or

(c) which on the merits of the decision is contrary to law,

and thus, being unlawful, is a violation of the rule of law. Such violation of the

rule of law amounts to an infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

618. Thus, it would be possible to a person who possesses the requisite locus standi to

impugn such unlawful decision by challenging such infringement of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution, by invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court vested in it by

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 272 of 306

Article 126 read with Article 17 of the Constitution, and seek and obtain a declaration

of such infringement and where appropriate necessary just and equitable relief.

Final analysis and conclusions pertaining to the grant of the purported Pardons

to the 2nd Respondent

619. This Court has already dealt with the grievous non-compliance with procedure

contained in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution on both occasions where

the 2nd Respondent was granted a pardon by the 11A Respondent. As pointed out,

such non-compliance with the procedure provided by law when arriving at the

decision by itself renders the decisions arrived at by the 11A Respondent to grant

pardon ultra-vires and hence unlawful.

620. As regards the merits of the decision to grant a pardon to the 2nd Respondent, learned

President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the selection of the 2nd

Respondent for the grant of a pardon had been without an objective assessment of

the merits based on rational and intelligible criteria. In the post-argument written

submissions, the learned President’s Counsel has submitted further that when

granting the second pardon, the 2nd Respondent had been selected for the grant of a

pardon to the exclusion of all the other convicts. Had there been an objective

consideration of the individual cases, the President should have first considered the

grant of a pardon to the following categories of persons who were being detained in

the death row:

(a) those who were responsible for committing murder, but the incident of killing

was less heinous in nature (intensity, ferocity and barbarity of the murder);

(b) those who were culpable for having committed murder, but the evidence

being indicative of the absence of any premeditation;

(c) persons who had been detained in the ‘death row’ for a longer period;

(d) those in respect of whom mitigatory circumstances applied.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 273 of 306

621. Learned President’s Counsel submitted that the evidence shows that the 11A

Respondent had not engaged in such an objective assessment of relevant facts and

circumstances. In the circumstances, he submitted that the conduct of the 11A

Respondent was not only unreasonable and arbitrary, but discriminatory as well.

622. Learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents also supported the

above submissions made by learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner.

623. In his first affidavit filed in this matter dated 30th November 2021, referring to the 1st

purported pardon, the 11A Respondent has taken-up the following position:

The Minister of Justice had appointed a review committee to review the sentences

imposed on all prisoners condemned to death. The said committee had

interviewed the relevant prisoners and thereafter acting on the recommendations

of the said committee the Minister by his letter dated 12th May 2016 had

recommended that the sentences of death imposed on 70 prisoners be commuted

to life imprisonment. The 2nd Respondent was also among the prisoners listed by

that Committee and recommended by the Minister. Accordingly, “following due

process and acting in terms of the powers vested in the President of the Republic

in terms of Article 34 of the Constitution” approved the afore-stated

recommendations and granted pardons to all 70 prisoners. In November 2019,

acting in terms of the powers vested in the President by Article 34 granted a

pardon to the 2nd Respondent who was serving a sentence of life imprisonment.

Acted reasonably and in compliance with due process. Acted within the powers

vested in the President by Article 34 of the Constitution, and therefore, all

aspersions cast on his actions/inactions are devoid of any factual or legal merit.

624. By his affidavit dated 4th November 2022, the 11A Respondent has reiterated the

above-mentioned narrative. In both affidavits, the 11A Respondent has highlighted

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 274 of 306

the fact that since he is no longer the President, he does not have access to the

relevant documentation.

625. Following this Court having called for the two files maintained by the Presidential

Secretariat regarding both purported pardons, having received them, and on the

instructions of this Court the learned ASG having issued copies of both files to all

parties, the 11A who thereby received splendid opportunity to refresh his memory,

did not seek to file a third affidavit further explaining his role on the grant of both

purported pardons. Further, the 11A Respondent chose not to give reasons for the

grant of the 2nd pardon which resulted in the release of the 2nd Respondent from

prison.

626. Before proceeding to consider the merits of the two decisions of the 11A Respondent

to grant two purported pardons to the 2nd Respondent, it is necessary to consider

another matter. The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on the footing

that the 11A Respondent had granted a pardon (a single pardon) to the 2nd

Respondent which resulted in the 2nd Respondent who had been sentenced to death

and was being detained in the death row being released from the prison. However,

document produced by the Petitioner marked “P3” being a ‘Press Release’ issued by

the Presidential Secretariat reveals that the release of the 2nd Respondent took place

in two phases. First, the sentence of death imposed by the Court of Appeal on the 2nd

Respondent (along with the sentence of death imposed on 69 other prisoners) who

was being detained in the death row was commuted by the 11A Respondent

purportedly under Article 34 of the Constitution to ‘life imprisonment’. Second, the

11A Respondent acting purportedly under Article 34, pardoned the 2nd Respondent

and thereby directed his release from prison, at a time when he was being detained

serving a term of life imprisonment. “P3” makes no reference to the dates on which

each of these two pardons were granted. As narrated at the commencement of this

judgment, the two-phased grant of relief to the 2nd Respondent is evident from the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 275 of 306

documentation and the minutes contained in the two files maintained in this regard

by the Presidential Secretariat.

627. Learned President’s Counsel for the 11A Respondent submitted that since the first

pardon had been granted in 2016, due to lapse of time in excess of one month, this

Court was devoid of jurisdiction to judicially review the corresponding decision.

However, since the Petitioner did not have prior knowledge that the 11A Respondent

had in 2016 granted a purported pardon to the 2nd Respondent, he cannot be faulted

for the delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. Furthermore, “P3” which is

evidently the only source of information the Petitioner had to comprehend the

internal decision-making of the Presidential Secretariat, in my view does not provide

adequate reliable information that would necessitate the Petitioner to structure his

Petition to this Court impugning the two purported pardons separately. Thus, I find

no fault in the Petition in that respect, and conclude that both decisions to grant

pardons are subject to review in these proceedings.

Findings of Court regarding the 1st purported Pardon

628. As discussed elsewhere in this judgment and as rightly conceded by learned

Additional Solicitor General, the procedure followed by the 11A Respondent and

other public functionaries which resulted in the substitution of a less severe form of

punishment (commutation of the sentence) from the death sentence to life

imprisonment to the 2nd Respondent is contrary to the mandatory procedure

prescribed in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution. Furthermore, the 11A

Respondent had not complied with the requirement contained in section 3(q) of Act

No. 4 of 2015. I observe that the ‘Review Committee’ appointed by the Minister of

Justice could administratively interview prisoners being detained in the death row

awaiting their execution (an event which has not taken place in this country since

1974) and could additionally make certain recommendations to the Minister of Justice.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 276 of 306

The Minister could take such recommendations into consideration when the President

seeks his opinion in terms of the proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution. In the

alternative, there is nothing in violation of the law, if the Minister presents the

recommendations of the Committee to the President, and thereafter, the President

sets in motion the procedure laid-down in the proviso to Article 34(1) of the

Constitution, and upon completion of the procedure contained in the proviso and

having conferred on the victims of crime the opportunity of complying with section

3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015, the President takes a decision on whether or not to grant a

pardon. However, in this instance, the procedure adopted in 2016 which culminated

in the grant of the purported 1st pardon to the 2nd Respondent and 69 others is

contrary to law and hence is unlawful, as the requisite process was not in conformity

with the procedure provided in the proviso to Article 34(1) and section 3(q) of Act No.

4 of 2015.

629. The evidence placed before this Court by the parties and the material called for from

the Presidential Secretariat and examined by this Court, do not show that the 11A

Respondent objectively considered the matter of granting pardons to the 70

prisoners, including the 2nd Respondent. However, there is no basis to conclude that

the 11A Respondent (the then President) acted subjectively either. He had merely

perfunctorily ‘approved’ the recommendation made to him by the Minister of Justice,

which was founded upon the report of the Review Committee. A consideration of the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal clearly reveals that the findings of the Committee as

regards the 2nd Respondent is erroneous on at least the question of premeditation.

Furthermore, a plain reading of the report of the Committee relating to the 2nd

Respondent shows so apparently that the Committee had taken the narrative given

by the 2nd Respondent ipsi dixit, as being correct, and had not engaged in any

independent verification of the information provided by the 2nd Respondent as

regards the incident in issue. Due to all these reasons, the perfunctory approval of the

recommendations of the Committee by the President, renders the exercise of power

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 277 of 306

by the 11A Respondent not in conformity with the law. Thus, the absence of objective

and consideration of relevant material in the backdrop of procedural non-compliance

with mandatory requirements provided by the law, renders the impugned purported

1st pardon unlawful and void in the eyes of the law.

Findings of Court regarding the 2nd purported Pardon

630. An examination of the evidence placed before this Court by the parties and the

material examined by this Court which included the totality of documentary material

maintained by the Presidential Secretariat with regard to the purported 2nd pardon,

reveals the following:

(i) The decision to grant the purported 2nd pardon had been taken by the 11A

Respondent (then President) contrary to the procedure prescribed in the

proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution, in the backdrop of such procedure

being mandatory.

(ii) The decision to grant the purported 2nd pardon had been taken by the 11A

Respondent without respecting and giving effect to the right of the 9th and 10th

Respondents and the mother of the deceased, conferred on them by section

3(q) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act,

No. 4 of 2015.

(iii) Procedural non-compliance with and acting contrary to the legal requirements

contained in the proviso to Article 34 and section 3(q) of Act No. 4 of 2015, by

itself renders the impugned second pardon void.

(iv) The 11A Respondent has not acted objectively in arriving at the decision to

grant the second purported pardon to the 2nd Respondent, due to arbitrariness

and unreasonableness in the decision-making process, and due to the

discriminatory approach adopted by him. The discriminatory approach

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 278 of 306

adopted by the 11A Respondent is evident when one considers the absence of

evidence which shows the existence of any intelligible criteria which

distinguishes the 2nd Respondent’s case from those of the other prisoners

similarly circumstanced (prisoners serving life imprisonment sequel to their

sentence of death being commuted to life imprisonment), and the non-

consideration of factors identical or similar to that of the 2nd Respondent with

regard to such other prisoners. The evidence shows a unilateral consideration

of mitigatory factors allegedly in favour of the 2nd Respondent, to the exclusion

of possible similar mitigatory factors that may be existent in favour of the other

prisoners who were serving life imprisonment.

(v) Additionally, the 11A Respondent’s decision to grant the purported 2nd pardon

is void due to the absence of any reasons for his decision being

contemporaneously recorded by him or on his behalf by an official assisting

him, and due to the failure on the part of the 11A Respondent to adduce

intelligible reasons for his decision before this Court.

(vi) A consideration of the totality of the applicable material and evidence

irresistibly suggests that the grant of the purported 2nd pardon did not serve

public interest, was not aimed at serving public interest and was founded

upon a consideration of factors which are incompatible with the purposes

for which the President is empowered to exercise the power of pardon by

Article 34 of the Constitution. The only interests that have been served are

the interests of the 2nd Respondent and those who may be near and dear to

him. In the circumstances, the 11A Respondent has grievously violated the

Public Trust Doctrine by abusing the power vested in the President by

Article 34(1) of the Constitution, for a collateral and improper purpose.

(vii) For all the reasons stated above, the impugned purported 2nd pardon is

unlawful and void.

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 279 of 306

631. I am inclined to add that, the evidence and material examined by this Court [including

in particular, the contents of the undated letter addressed to the President sent by

Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero (received and considered by the 11A Respondent on

2nd February 2019) and “P3”] suggest the inference that the 11A Respondent’s

decision to grant the purported 2nd pardon had been accentuated by extraneous and

irrelevant factors including possible persuasion by Venerable Athuraliye Ratana Thero.

However, I will restrain myself from arriving at any finding in that regard, due to lack

of sufficient cogent evidence and as the venerable Thero was not a party to these

proceedings.

Declarations, Remedies and Orders

632. In view of the foregoing findings and conclusions reached by this Court, exercising

the just and equitable jurisdiction of this Court vested in it by Article 126 of the

Constitution, the following declarations, remedies are orders are made:

I. It is declared that the grant of the purported 1st pardon in favour of inter alia

the 2nd Respondent on or about 17th May 2016 is contrary to law, and is

accordingly declared unlawful and void.

II. It is declared that the grant of the purported 2nd pardon in favour of the 2nd

Respondent on or about the 30th October 2019 is contrary to law, and is

accordingly declared unlawful and void.

III. It is declared that by the grant of the impugned purported 1st and 2nd pardons

referred to in this judgment, the 11A Respondent – former President

Maithripala Sirisena has infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioner, and

the 9th and 10th Respondents guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

IV. In consideration of the grievously abusive, irresponsible, callous and unlawful

manner in which the 11A Respondent has exercised power vested in the

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 280 of 306

President by Article 34(1) of the Constitution on the occasion of the grant of

the purported 2nd pardon, as a deterrence measure to him and to all those

holding public office and is vested with power to exercise for specific purposes

which shall be overall in public interest, the 11A Respondent is directed to pay

a sum of Rupees One Million to the Petitioner. The Petitioner shall hold such

money in trust, and spend for purposes that are in the best interests of female

victims of crime. This sum of money shall be paid within one month of the

delivery of this judgment.

V. As a solatium for having caused the infringement of the fundamental right of

the 9th and 10th Respondents guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution

and for the pain of mind caused to them and complained of, the 11A

Respondent is directed to pay a sum of Rupees One Million each to the 9th and

10th Respondents. This sum of money shall be paid within one month of this

judgment.

VI. The Attorney-General shall within one month of this judgment present to His

Excellency the President, to the Minister of Justice, to the Secretary to the

President and to the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, a legal advisory

containing the principles applicable to the grant of a Pardon to a prisoner, as

stipulated in this judgment, and the procedure to be followed with regard to

the processing of a request for the grant of a pardon and taking a decision in

that regard. A copy of that legal advisory shall be tendered to this Court by

Motion.

VII. The Attorney-General shall forthwith, with the assistance of the relevant

competent authorities, set in motion a procedure aimed at locating the 2nd

Respondent and in terms of the applicable law and agreements with foreign

countries, to have him located, brought back to Sri Lanka, apprehended and be

placed back in prison to serve life imprisonment. [This order is made in view of

Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 281 of 306

information placed before this Court that sequel to the filing of this Application,

immediately preceding this Court having made an interim order on 29th

November 2019 restraining the 2nd Respondent from leaving the country, he

had left the country, and since not returned.]

It is to be noted that, though this Court has declared the impugned 1st pardon

unlawful and therefore void, given the lapse of time since the grant of such

pardon and the fact that it applied to 69 other prisoners who were being

detained in the death row, exercising the inherent discretionary authority

vested in this Court by the just and equitable jurisdiction conferred on its under

Article 126 of the Constitution, this Court refrains from directing that upon

being located, apprehended and returned to prison, the 2nd Respondent be

placed in the death row.

The Attorney-General shall once in every two months file a Motion in Court

setting out steps taken with regard to the implementation of this order and the

associated development.

VIII. The Petitioner and the 9th and 10th Respondents shall be entitled to recover

from the 11A Respondent, cost of this litigation.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 282 of 306

JANAK DE SILVA, J

633. I have had the benefit of reading an early draft of the judgment proposed to be

delivered by my brother, Justice Thurairaja, P.C. and the draft judgment of Justice

Kodagoda, P.C. I am in agreement with their conclusions that:

(a) The grant of the 1st pardon by the 11A Respondent to the 2nd Respondent on

or about 17th May 2016, whereby a term of life imprisonment was substituted

to the death sentence, is contrary to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution and hence

void and of no force or avail in law;

(b) The grant of the 2nd pardon by the 11A Respondent to the 2nd Respondent on

or about 30th October 2019, whereby the 11A Respondent purported to

approve the release of the 2nd Respondent, is contrary to Article 34 (1) of the

Constitution and hence void and of no force or avail in law.

634. Nevertheless, my brothers differ on the reasons based on which they have arrived at

the same conclusions. The declarations and orders they make also differ. Moreover,

there are some differences on the reasons for my conclusions. In the circumstances,

there is a compulsion to give detailed reasons for my conclusions and the declarations

and orders I propose to make in order to ensure that there is a majority judgment on

the reasoning leading to the conclusions and the declarations and orders made by

Court.

635. In doing so, I will address the following issues:

(A) The effect of a pardon under Article 34 (1) of the Constitution;

(B) Judicial Power under the 1978 Constitution;

(C) Procedural requirements for the grant of a pardon under the Proviso to

Article 34 (1) of the Constitution;

(D) Judicial Review of the grant of a pardon by the President under Article 34 (1)

of the Constitution;

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 283 of 306

(E) Due compliance with the procedural requirements; and,

(F) Legality of the grant of the 1st and 2nd pardons

636. I need not deal with the factual matrix of this matter as my brothers have set them

out in great detail.

637. Before setting forth my views on the merits of the application, I must address the

preliminary objection raised by the learned President’s Counsel for the 11A

Respondent that a necessary party, namely the incumbent Minister of Justice Hon. Dr.

Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, P.C. has not been made a party to this application. It was

pointed out that he was also the Minister of Justice at the time the impugned pardon

was granted. My brother Justice Thurairaja, P.C. has overruled this preliminary

objection for reasons set out.

638. I am in respectful agreement with his conclusion but for different reasons. It is

observed that the 6th Respondent and the three substituted 6th Respondents are the

then Minister of Justice, subsequent Ministers of Justice ending with the present

Minister of Justice. Thus, the incumbent Minister of Justice Hon. Dr. Wijeyadasa

Rajapakse, P.C. is in fact a Respondent to the Application.

639. In any event, the Petitioner is impugning the grant of pardons to the 2nd Respondent

by the 11A Respondent. In terms of Article 34 (1) of the Constitution, it is the President

and the President alone who is empowered to grant a pardon. No doubt there is a

consultative process contemplated. Nevertheless, the final decision on whether or not

to grant a pardon must be taken by the President and no other. Any alienation or

acting under dictation will vitiate the pardon.

640. Accordingly, even if there was any failure to add the then Minister of Justice as a

Respondent, it will not be fatal to this application.

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 284 of 306

(A) The effect of a pardon under Article 34 (1) of the Constitution

641. The learned A.S.G. drew our attention to the provisions in Sections 311 and 312 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act and Sections 58, 94 and 235 (1) of the Prisons

Ordinance No. 16 of 1877 as amended. However, the impugned pardons have been

granted pursuant to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution. Hence there is no need to

examine the interface, if any, between those provisions and Article 34 (1) of the

Constitution. In any event, constitutional provisions must take precedence and apply

in case of any inconsistency with any other law.

642. In Southern Provincial Co-operative Employee’s Service Commission v. Bentota

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. and Others [C.A. (P.H.C.) 71/2013, C. A.

M. 09.08.2018], I held that if there is a conflict between an Act and the Constitution,

clearly the constitutional provision prevails as the Grundnorm in the sense

propounded by Kelson.

643. Prior to examining the legal effect of a pardon under Article 34 (1) of the Constitution,

a comparative examination is both useful and necessary.

England

644. The power of pardon in England was with the Sovereign as part of the prerogative

power. The justification for this is described by Chitty [Joseph Chitty, A treatise on the

law of the prerogatives of the crown: and the relative duties and rights of the subject

(London, 1820), page 89] as follows:

“The King is, in legal contemplation, injured by the commission of public offences;

his peace is said to be violated thereby, and the right to pardon cannot be vested

more properly than in the Sovereign, who is, from his situation, more likely than

any other person to exercise it with impartiality, and to whom good policy requires

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 285 of 306

that the people should look, with submissive respect as the head of the nation,

and supreme guardian of the laws.”

645. The unfettered exercise of such power was not lacking of controversy. In fact, the Earls,

the Church of England and Parliament would contest the King's pardoning power and

"when [these] rival authorities struggled for power, it was often the power to pardon

that they sought" [Kathleen Dean Moore, Pardons: Justice, Mercy and the Public Interest

(OUP, 1989), page 17]. At one time, the prerogative power of mercy of the King was

sought to be controlled through legislative intervention. Hence in 1328, a statute

called in general terms, for restraint in issuing pardons. In 1390 the Commons secured

a statute which recognised certain pardons as issuing from the Chancery as a matter

of course [Theodore F. T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law (Liberty

Fund, 2010), pages 445-446].

646. The legal effect of a pardon in England was not beyond debate. Early on it was

considered that a pardon left the existence of a conviction untouched. This was on

the basis that the King was not vested with the power of administration of justice, a

position supported by the writings of Bracton, Blackstone, Hawkins [William Hawkins,

A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, (1824)] and Holdsworth [William Searle

Holdsworth, A History of English law (Methuen and Company, 1903)].

647. Nevertheless, subsequently there were judicial pronouncements to the contrary. In

Cuddington v. Wilkins [80 Eng. Rep. 231, 232 (K.B. 1614)] it was held that “[T]he

King’s pardon doth not only clear the offence itself, but all the dependencies, penalties,

and disabilities incident unto it”.

648. Hence it was at one time considered that a pardon erased all aspects of the conviction.

Thus, Chitty [ibid. page 102] states that:

“The King’s pardon, if general in its purport and sufficient in other respects,

obliterates every stain which the law attached to the offender. Generally speaking,

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 286 of 306

it puts him in the same situation as that in which he stood before he committed

the pardoned offence; and frees him from the penalties and forfeitures to which

the law subjected his person and property […] a legal pardon impliedly removes

the stigma and restores a man to credit, so as to enable him to be a witness; and

it so far makes him a new man as to entitle him, according to some of our old

books, to bring an action against anyone who scandalizes him in respect of the

crime pardoned.”

649. However, in R v. Foster [(1984) 2 All ER 679 at 687] the Court of Appeal examined

in great detail the jurisprudence on this issue and held that the effect of a free pardon

is such as, in the words of the pardon itself, to remove from the subject of the pardon,

‘all pains penalties and punishments whatsoever that from the said conviction may

ensue’, but not eliminate the conviction itself. The Court was guided by the principle

that the Crown no longer has a prerogative of justice but only a prerogative of mercy.

It is only a court of law with competent jurisdiction that has the power to quash a

conviction.

USA

650. The position in the USA took somewhat of a similar route to that in England. In Ex

Parte Garland [71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 380, 18 L. Ed. 366 (1866)] it was held that:

“A pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt

of the offender; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots

out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent

as if he had never committed the offense."

651. Nevertheless, in Burdick v. United States [236 U.S. 79, 91, 35 S.Ct. 267, 59 L. Ed

476 (1915)] it was held that a pardon does not "blot out guilt" nor does it restore the

offender to a state of innocence in the eye of the law as was suggested in Ex Parte

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 287 of 306

Garland (supra). It was held that far from blotting out guilt, the acceptance of a

pardon may constitute a confession of guilt.

652. In U.S. v. Benz [75 L. Ed. 354 at 358] it was held that:

“The judicial power and the executive power over sentences are readily

distinguishable. To render judgment is a judicial function. To carry the judgment

into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an act of clemency

is an exercise of executive power which abridges the enforcement of the judgment,

but does not alter it qua judgment. To reduce a sentence by amendment alters

the terms of the judgment itself and is a judicial act as much as the imposition of

the sentence in the first instance.”

653. This approach was affirmed in Nixon v United States [506 US 224, 232 (1993)]

where it was held:

“But the granting of a pardon is in no sense an overturning of a judgment of

conviction by some other tribunal; it is "[a]n executive action that mitigates or

sets aside punishment for a crime."

654. The position in the USA now is that although the effects of the commission of the

offense lingers after a pardon, the effects of the conviction are all but wiped out.

Again, this approach is founded on the separation of the judicial power from the

executive arm of government.

India

655. The position in India on the effect of a Presidential pardon is succinctly set out in

Maru Ram Etc. v. Union of India and Another [1980 AIR 2147 at 2158] where it

was held that:

“Two fundamental principles in sentencing jurisprudence have to be grasped in

the context of the Indian corpus juris. The first is that sentencing is a judicial

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 288 of 306

function and whatever may be done in the matter of executing that sentence in

the shape of remitting, commuting or otherwise abbreviating, the Executive

cannot alter the sentence itself. In Rabha's case, a Constitution Bench of this Court

illumined this branch of law. What is the jural consequence of a remission of

sentence?

In the first place, an order of remission does not wipe out the offence, it also does

not wipe out the conviction. All that it does is to have an effect on the execution

of the sentence; though ordinarily a convicted person would have to serve out the

full sentence imposed by a court, he need not do so with respect to that part of

the sentence which has been ordered to be remitted. An order of remission thus

does not in any way interfere with the order of the court; it affects only the

execution of the sentence passed by the court and frees the convicted

person from his liability to undergo the full term of imprisonment inflicted

by the court, though the order of conviction and sentence passed by the

court still stands as it was. The power to grant remission is executive power

and cannot have the effect which the order of an appellate or revisional court

would have of reducing the sentence passed by the trial court and substituting in

its place the reduced sentence adjudged by the appellate or revisional court. This

distinction is well brought out in the following passage from Weater's

"Constitutional Law" on the effect of reprieves and pardons vis a vis the judgment

passed by the court imposing punishment, at p. 176, para 134:- "A reprieve is a

temporary suspension of the punishment fixed by law. A pardon is the remission

of such punishment. Both are the exercise of executive functions and should be

distinguished from the exercise of judicial power over sentences. 'The judicial

power and the executive power over sentences are readily distinguishable',

observed Justice Sutherland, 'To render a judgment is a judicial function. To

carry the judgment into effect is an executive function. To cut short a

sentence by an act of clemency is an exercise of executive power which

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 289 of 306

abridges the enforcement of the judgment but does not alter it qua

judgment." (emphasis added)

656. In Kehar Sing and Another Etc. v. Union of India and Another [(1988) Supp. 3

S.C.R. 1102 at 1111] it was held that, in granting a pardon, the President does not

amend or modify or supersede the judicial record. The judicial record remains intact,

and undisturbed. The President acts in a wholly different plane from that in which the

Court acted. He acts under a constitutional power, the nature of which is entirely

different from the judicial power and cannot be regarded as an extension of it.

657. This approach is consonant with the traditional demarcation between the powers of

government. The legislature enacts laws through legislation, the executive makes

policy and executes the laws while the judiciary exercises judicial power and

determines disputes between the State and a private party and between private

parties.

658. Accordingly, in order to appreciate the legal effect of a pardon given under the 1978

Constitution, it is necessary to ascertain which organ of the State has been vested with

judicial power under the 1978 Constitution.

659. Before doing so, let me briefly examine the historical context of the constitutional

structure of Sri Lanka and the power of pardon.

Sri Lanka

660. The power of pardon was part of the constitutional framework of Sri Lanka from the

time of monarchism. The Royal prerogative of pardon was identified as rāja karuna

(The Mahāvamsa, Ven. Buddhadatta Thero (ed.), 81 p. 533 v. 5).

661. According to Amerasinghe [A.R.B. Amerasinghe, The Legal heritage of Sri Lanka, The

Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka, The Law and Society Trust, Sarvodaya Vishva Lekha

Publishers 1999, page 184]:

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 290 of 306

“[A] king had the power of pardon. Often, its exercise had little or nothing to do

with guilt or innocence: ‘executive policy’ was the underlying consideration […]

Sometimes, it seems, a monarch was moved to vary a sentence in appeal out of

compassion rather than on account of the merits of a case. Thus the Pūjāvaliya

referred to the possibility of a traitor who deserved to be impaled, escaping with

a small fine “if he wins the king’s heart””.

662. According to Wijayatunga [Harischandra Wijayatunga, Legal Philosophy in Medieval

Siṅhalē, Godage International Publishers (Pvt) Ltd., 2008, 177], under modern law,

royal prerogative of pardon is mainly of three sorts:

(1) Free pardon – which rescinds both the sentence and the conviction

(2) Commutation or conditional pardon – which substitutes one form of

punishment for another, and

(3) Remission – which reduces the amount of a sentence without changing its

character

663. Amerasinghe (supra) and Wijayatunga (supra., 176) narrates instances in which

Parākramabāhu II, Vijayabāhu II and Sirisamghabodi exercised the Royal prerogative

of pardon. According to Wijayatunga (supra. 177-178), the royal prerogative of

pardon was enjoyed by the son of the king as well and gives the example of Prince

Vijayabāhu, son of Parākramabāhu II exercising such power

(B) Judicial Power under the 1978 Constitution

664. In Ratnasiri Perera v. Dissanayake, Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative

Development and Others [(1992) 1 Sri. L. R. 286 at 296] Fernando J. held that

whether the relevant provisions in the 1978 Constitution is different from the previous

regime must be considered having regard to the fact that the relevant provisions of

the 1978 Constitution were not enacted in vacuo, but in the background of the

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 291 of 306

Constitutional provisions, judicial decisions and unsettled problems of the preceding

three decades.

665. Prior to the 1972 Constitution, it was accepted that judicial power remained with the

judiciary since the Charter of Justice of 1801. As was pointed out by the Privy Council

in Liyanage and Others v. The Queen (68 N.L.R. 265 at 282), the Constitution's

silence as to the vesting of judicial power is consistent with its remaining, where it had

lain for more than a century, in the hands of the judicature. It is not consistent with

any intention that henceforth it should pass to, or be shared by, the executive or the

legislature.

666. The 1972 Constitution, the first autochthonous constitution introduced after

independence, sought to constitutionalise the concept of Sovereignty. It

acknowledged that the Sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable (Article 3).

Nevertheless, it did not recognise the concept of separation of powers. The National

State Assembly was the institution through which the Sovereignty of the People was

to be exercised (Article 4) and was expressly acknowledged to be the supreme

instrument of State Power of the Republic (Article 5). It exercised judicial power of the

People through courts and other institutions created by law except in the case of

matters relating to its powers and privileges, wherein the judicial power of the People

may be exercised directly by the National State Assembly according to law.

667. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court took the view in the Local Authorities

(Imposition of Civic Disabilities) (No. 2) Bill [Decisions of the Constitutional

Court of Sri Lanka, Vol. 6, page 30] that Parliament today is, as the National State

Assembly was, incompetent to exercise directly the judicial power which is to be

exercised only through courts and similar institutions. In effect it was acknowledged

that there was a functional separation of powers under the 1972 Constitution.

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 292 of 306

668. The distortion created by the convergence of governmental power in one institution,

as was the case under the 1972 Constitution, is best expounded by Montesquieu

[Translation by Thomas Nugent, The Spirit of the Laws, Hafner Publishing Company,

1959, Book XI, Chap. 6, pages 151-152]:

“When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in

the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions

may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to

execute them in a tyrannical manner.

Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the

legislative and the executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty

of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then

the legislature. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave

with violence and oppression.”

669. Moreover, Blackstone [Blackstone's Commentaries Vol. 1 at p. 269] states:

“In this distinct and separate existence of the judicial power in a peculiar body of

men, nominated indeed, but not removable at pleasure by the Crown, consists

one main preservative of the public liberty which cannot subsist long in any state,

unless the administration of common justice be, in some degree, separated both

from the legislative and also from the executive power. Were it joined with the

legislative, the life, liberty and property of the subject would be in the

hands of arbitrary judges, whose decisions would be then regulated only

by their opinions, and not by any fundamental principles of law; which

though legislators may depart from, yet judges are bound to observe. Were

it joined with the executive, this union might soon be an overbalance for

the legislative.” (emphasis added)

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 293 of 306

670. The Report of the Select Committee of the National State Assembly appointed to

consider the Revision of the Constitution [Parliamentary Series No. 14 of the National

State Assembly] (“Report”) took the view that the 1972 Constitution and in particular,

Article 5, did not effectively guarantee the Sovereignty of the People. The Select

Committee was of the view (at page 142) that there was no check on either the

Legislature or the Executive acting in derogation of the Sovereignty of the People, or

even in usurping it.

671. The Select Committee submitted a Draft Constitution along with the Report. In

explaining its functioning, the Report states that, the Legislative, Executive and Judicial

powers of the People are to be exercised by the different organs referred to in Article

4 of the Draft Constitution and that adequate safeguards have been provided to

prevent the erosion of the Sovereignty of the People.

672. The Report goes on to state (at page 142) that the division of powers among the

different organs of government tends to act as a restraint upon the arbitrary exercise,

or abuse of, power by the delegates of the People. Significantly, the Report states (at

pages 142-143) that the Draft Constitution makes provision:

“[…] for the exercise of judicial power of the People by an independent Judiciary.

The independence of the Judiciary is secured, in the case of the minor judiciary,

by vesting the powers of appointment, dismissal, transfer, and disciplinary control

in an independent Judicial Service Commission. The independence of the Judges

of the Superior Courts is secured by making Constitutional provision for the

security of tenure of such Judges, for the establishment of the Superior Courts and

for the entrenchment of the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts, thereby precluding

the abolition of these Courts and the creation of parallel jurisdictions by ordinary

legislation.”

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 294 of 306

673. It is significant that Article 4 (e) of the Draft Constitution annexed to the Report and

Articles 4 (c) of the 1978 Constitution are substantially the same. Article 4 (c) of the

1978 Constitution reads as follows:

“The judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts,

tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the

Constitution, or created and established by law, except in regard to matters

relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its

Members wherein the judicial power of the People may be exercised directly by

Parliament according to law.”

674. Clearly, Parliament is not the source of the judicial power of the People. The repository

of the judicial power of the People is none other than the People themselves on whom

the judicial power is vested as part of their inalienable Sovereignty.

675. Accordingly, the judicial power of the People is exercised by courts, tribunals and

institutions created and established, or recognised, by the Constitution, or created

and established by law, except in regard to matters relating to the privileges,

immunities and powers of Parliament and of its members.

676. Even where the Parliament has been vested with the judicial power relating to the

privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members, such judicial

power is limited. Section 22 (3) of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act No. 5 of

1978 as amended, states that every breach of the privileges of Parliament which is

specified in Part B of the Schedule to that Act and which is committed in respect of,

or in relation to, Parliament shall be an offence under that Part punishable by

Parliament.

677. Hence, the judicial power of the Parliament is confined to matters specified in Part B

of the Schedule to the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act No. 5 of 1978 as

amended. In terms of Section 22 (2) every breach of the privileges of Parliament which

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 295 of 306

is specified in the Schedule to this Act (whether in part A or Part B thereof) shall be an

offence under that Part punishable by the Supreme Court under the relevant

provisions.

678. The judiciary is an unelected body unlike the executive and the legislature. Since the

1978 Constitution recognises that Sovereignty is in the People, there is no mode

through which the judicial power of the People can be transmitted directly to the

judiciary. The transmission of the judicial power of the People to the judiciary through

the conduit of the Parliament, assists to keep the nexus between the Sovereignty of

the People and the exercise of the judicial power of the People by the judiciary. This

gives legal effect to the political theory permeating the notion of Sovereignty being

with the People. Article 4 (c) of the Constitution must be read and understood in this

context.

679. Accordingly, under the 1978 Constitution, the judicial power of the People is vested

with the judiciary except in so far as the matters specified in Part B of the Schedule to

Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act No. 5 of 1978 as amended where there is

concurrent judicial power in Parliament and the Supreme Court. This position has

been reiterated by Court in several decisions.

680. In Hewamanne v. De Silva and Another [(1983) 1 Sri. L.R. 1 at 20] Wanasundera

J. held:

“Article 4(c) states that –

[…]

On a plain reading of this provision, it is clear that the judicial power of the People

can only be exercised by "judicial officers" as defined in Article 170, except in

regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament.

I think no counsel before us disputed that these provisions indicate an

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 296 of 306

unmistakable vesting of the judicial power of the People in the judiciary

established by or under the Constitution and that Parliament acts as a

conduit through which the judicial power of the People passes to the

judiciary. Whatever the wording of Article 4 (c) may suggest, there could be little

doubt that at the lowest this provision, read with the other provisions, has

brought about a functional separation of the judicial power from the other powers

in our Constitution and accordingly the domain of judicial power (except the

special area carved out for Parliament), has been entrusted solely and

exclusively to the judiciary.” (emphasis added)

681. In Premachandra v. Major Montague Jayawickrema and Another (Provincial

Governors’ Case) [(1994) 2 Sri.L.R. 90 at 107] it was held:

“[…] Although Article 4(c) vests judicial power in Parliament, yet there is a

functional separation of powers inasmuch as judicial power can only be

exercised by courts and other judicial tribunals, subject only to one

exception in regard to Parliamentary privilege. And even in that field,

when Parliament acts as an institution directly exercising judicial power,

there is no express exclusion or exemption from judicial review

under Article 140 (cf. Dissanayake v. Kaleel(15)). The Superior Courts are

thus functionally a separate and co-ordinate organ of government; its power of

judicial review cannot be less than that of a body to Parliament; it is illogical to

contend that "political questions" are excluded from review by the Judiciary if it is

an organ of government co-ordinate with the other organs of government, but

are reviewable by the Judiciary if it is a subordinate organ.” (emphasis added)

682. In Dr. Athulasiri Kumara Samarakoon and Others v. Ranil Wickramasinghe and

Others [S.C. (F.R.) 195/2022 and 212/2022, S.C.M. 14.11.2023 (Economic Crisis

case), at page 64], the majority (Jayasuriya C.J., Aluwihare, Malalgoda, M. Fernando

JJ.) held:

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 297 of 306

“The Supreme Court is the highest and final Superior Court of record of the

Republic. Article 4(c) of the Constitution recognizes that the Parliament

exercises people’s judicial power through courts created and established or

recognized by the Constitution or created and established by law. However,

the Parliament is empowered to exercise People’s judicial power, directly,

in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of

Parliament and of its Members, according to law. Therefore, there is no

doubt or ambiguity as to the power of Courts to exercise judicial power of

the People in regard to all matters that are recognized by law other than

the specific instance excluded by Article 4(c). The Constitution which is the

Supreme law of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka assures that

independence of the judiciary as an intangible heritage that guarantees the

dignity and well-being of succeeding generations of the People of Sri Lanka.”

(emphasis added)

683. A plain reading of Article 4 (c) of the Constitution makes it clear that the 1978

Constitution does not seek to confer any judicial power in the executive. This view is

fortified upon an examination of Article 34 of the Constitution which reads as follows:

“34. (1) The President may in the case of any offender convicted of any

offense in any court within the Republic of Sri Lanka –

(a) Grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions;

(b) Grant any respite, either indefinite for such period as the

President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence passed

on such offender;

(c) Substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment

imposed on such offender; or

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 298 of 306

(d) Remit the whole or any part of any punishment imposed or any

of any penalty or forfeiture otherwise due to the Republic on

account of such offence…”

684. None of these provisions indicate any intention on the part of the legislature to

consider such a pardon, respite, substitution of a less severe form of punishment or

remission to amount to an obliteration of the conviction and sentence imposed by a

court of competent jurisdiction. It cannot in law do so since Article 4 (c) of the

Constitution does not seek to vest any judicial power in the executive. It is trite law

that where two or more interpretations are possible, Court must select the

interpretation consistent with the Constitution rather than one which is inconsistent

with it.

685. For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the power given to the President under Article

34 (1) of the Constitution does not have the legal effect of altering the judgment or

sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction. It only liberates the offender from the

execution of the sentence passed by the Court to the extent specified in the pardon.

(C) Procedural requirements for the grant of a pardon under the Proviso to

Article 34(1) of the Constitution

686. I am in respectful agreement with the views expressed by my brother Justice

Kodagoda PC on the procedure that must be followed in terms of the Proviso to

Article 34(1) of the Constitution before the President exercises any power of pardon,

respite, substitution of a less severe form of punishment or remission.

687. For purposes of clarity, I re-produce the procedural requirements expounded by my

brother Justice Kodagoda J, P.C. with which I am in entire agreement:

1. The President shall cause a report to be made to him by the Judge who tried

the case.

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 299 of 306

2. The President shall forward such report to the Attorney-General. The

communication to the Attorney- General shall contain instructions, that after

the Attorney-General has advised thereon, the report of the Judge shall be sent

together with the Attorney-General’s advice to the Minister in-charge of the

subject of Justice.

3. On the receipt of the afore-stated communication from the President, upon a

consideration of the report of the Judge and other relevant material which the

Attorney-General may be briefed of such as a report of the State Counsel who

conducted the prosecution against the convict (though a consideration of such

additional material is not a requirement contained in the proviso to Article 34(1),

thus not a mandatory requirement), the Attorney-General shall record his

advice on the matter, and forward the report of the Judge (together with his

advice) to the Minister in-charge of the subject of Justice.

4. Upon receipt of the material submitted by the Attorney-General, the Minister

in-charge of the subject of Justice shall on a consideration of such material and

any other material which the Minister may deem to be relevant (which is also

not a mandatory requirement), forward to the President his recommendation.

It is reasonably assumed that to the Minister’s communication to the President

would be attached, the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General.

(D) Judicial Review of the grant of a pardon by the President under Article

34(1)

688. The learned ASG submitted that judicial review of the power of pardon on the merits

would violate the separation of powers, including the principle of checks and balances.

In the alternative, it was submitted that the power of pardon is sui generis in nature

and not amenable to the jurisdiction of Court under Article 126.

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 300 of 306

689. In Premachandra v. Attorney General and Others [S.C. (F.R.) Application No.

221/2021, S.C.M. 17.01.2024] Court rejected the argument that the grant of a

pardon to an offender by the President is not reviewable by this Court in terms of its

jurisdiction under Article 126 read with the proviso to Article 35 of the Constitution.

690. My brother Justice Kodagoda, P.C. has dealt with these contentions and held that a

decision of the President on the grant or refusal of the grant of a pardon is reviewable

by the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction contained in Article 126 read with Article

17 of the Constitution, not only on grounds of procedural ultra vires, but on the merits

of the decision as well. I am in respectful agreement with his reasoning and

conclusions.

691. Nevertheless, I wish to consider a matter raised by the learned ASG by reference to

the determination of Court in The Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution Bill

[S.C.S.D. 31-37/2022] since I was a member of the bench which made that

determination. The learned ASG referred to the Delegation test and Alienation test

propounded therein and contended that if the grant of the presidential pardon by the

President, who is conferred that power by Article 34 (1) is reviewed on the merits by

the Supreme Court in exercise of the fundamental rights jurisdiction, it would fail the

delegation test as it would ‘bring in another person or institution’ into the exercise of

such power.

692. In The Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution Bill (supra. page 41) Court

held that:

“Accordingly, it is our view that the proper tests to be adopted in determining

whether a violation of Article 4 leads to a violation of Article 3 are as follows:

1. Different features of the Sovereignty that is reposed in the People can

be delegated by the People to be exercised by an organ of government.

Delegation by the People of the Sovereignty reposed in them is part of

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 301 of 306

their Sovereignty identified in Article 3. Article 4 deals with both the

delegation and the exercise of different features of Sovereignty. In

terms of Article 4(b), the People have delegated their executive power

to the President elected by them. Any change to such delegation which

brings in another person or institution to exercise the executive power

of the People must be with the approval of the People as otherwise it

infringes Article 3. (Delegation Test).

2. The transfer, relinquishment or removal of a power attributed to one

organ of Government to another organ or body would be inconsistent

with Article 3 read with Article 4 of the Constitution. (Alienation Test)”

693. Court laid down these two tests to determine whether a violation of Article 4 leads to

a violation of Article 3. It has no application in determining whether the exercise of

judicial power by Court amounts to an exercise of executive power since judicial power

by its very nature is directed, inter alia, at ensuring that legislative action, in the case

of Sri Lanka at the pre-enactment stage, and executive and administrative actions are

in accordance with law. As was held in Premachandra vs. Major Montague

Jayawickrema [(1994) 2 Sri. L.R. 9 at 102], “[I]n Sri Lanka, however, it is the

Constitution which is supreme, and a violation of the Constitution is prima facie a matter

to be remedied by the Judiciary”.

694. In any event, the 11A Respondent has not given any reasons for the exercise of the

power of pardon in terms of Article 34(1) of the Constitution in relation to the 1st or

2nd pardons.

695. In so far as the 1st pardon is concerned, all what is said in his affidavit dated 30th

November 2021, is that he had granted the pardon acting on the recommendations

of the committee and the Minister of Justice. Such a course of action is untenable in

law and amounts to abdication and acting under dictation. It is only the President,

who has been vested with the power of pardon in terms of Article 34(1) of the

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 302 of 306

Constitution, who can decide to grant a pardon. While it is possible for him to appoint

a body to consider the matter in detail and submit a report to him, he cannot be heard

to state that the pardon was granted based on the recommendation of such body. He

must give his independent mind to the issue and decide whether or not to exercise

the power of pardon. On the available material he has not done so. Hence the

question of examining the merits of the decision of the 11A Respondent does not

arise for consideration.

696. In relation to the 2nd pardon, all what is stated by the 11A Respondent is that acting

reasonably and in compliance with due process, he granted the pardon to the 2nd

Respondent. No reasons for the exercise of the power of pardon is set out. Thus, in

this instance as well, the question of examining the merits of the decision of the 11A

Respondent does not arise for consideration.

(E) Due compliance with the procedural requirements

697. The 11A Respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements (1) to (4)

enumerated above as required by the Proviso to Article 34(1) of the Constitution

before granting the 1st and 2nd pardons as more fully elucidated by my brothers Justice

Thurairaja, P.C. and Justice Kodagoda, P.C.

(F) Legality of the grant of the 1st pardon

698. As adumbrated earlier, the 11A Respondent has failed to give any reasons for the

grant of the 1st pardon. Moreover, even the records maintained at the Presidential

Secretariat do not contain any reasons for the grant of such pardon.

699. In Pushpakumara v. Director-General (Electric and Electronic Division), Sri Lanka

Navy Headquarters and Others [S.C. (F.R.) Application No: 452/2011, S.C.M.

06.07.2021, pp. 5-6], I held as follows:

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 303 of 306

“I have no hesitation in holding that once the fundamental rights jurisdiction of

this Court is invoked, the decision-maker owes a duty to the Court to disclose the

reasons for his decision. Even where no reasons have been given to the affected

party, the departmental file must contain the reasons for the impugned decision.

Where no such reasons have been recorded, the only conclusion the Court can

draw is that the decision was taken devoid of any reasons and is hence arbitrary.”

700. Article 12 (1) of the Constitution embodies the rule of law. Arbitrary action is anathema

to the rule of law. Failure to provide reasons for the exercise of executive power makes

the exercise of such power arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, I hold that the 1st

pardon infringes the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution

and hence is void and of no force or avail in law.

701. The 11A Respondent has also failed to comply with the procedural requirements (1)

to (4) enumerated above as required by the Proviso to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution

before granting the 1st pardon as more fully elucidated above. Accordingly, I hold

that the 1st pardon violates the rule of law and infringes the fundamental right

guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Hence, it is void and of no force or

avail in law on that ground as well.

(G) Legality of the grant of the 2nd pardon

702. The 11A Respondent has failed to provide reasons for the grant of the 2nd pardon.

Moreover, even the records maintained at the Presidential Secretariat do not contain

any reasons for the grant of such pardon.

703. Hence, applying the principle expounded by me in Pushpakumara (supra), I hold

that the grant of the 2nd pardon is arbitrary and capricious. Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution embodies the rule of law. Arbitrary action is anathema to the rule of law.

Failure to provide reasons for the exercise of executive power makes the exercise of

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 304 of 306

such power arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, I hold that the 2nd pardon infringes

the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution and hence is

void and of no force or avail in law.

704. I agree with the contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner that

the 1st pardon does not have the effect of altering the “historical fact” that the 2nd

Respondent was convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction and sentenced to

death. The conviction and sentence were imposed by the exercise of judicial power.

705. An executive pardon pursuant to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution does not alter the

status of an offender. For the purposes of Article 34 (1), he remains an offender who

has been condemned to suffer death by the sentence of any court. Thus, every time any

pardon is contemplated to such a person, the procedure in the Proviso to Article 34

(1) of the Constitution must be followed.

706. As adumbrated above, the procedural requirements in the Proviso to Article 34 (1) of

the Constitution were not followed in granting the 2nd pardon. Accordingly, I hold that

the 2nd pardon violates the rule of law and infringes the fundamental right guaranteed

by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Hence, it is void and of no force or avail in law on

that ground as well.

707. For the foregoing reasons, I declare that:

(a) The grant of the first pardon by the 11A Respondent to the 2nd Respondent on

or about 17th May 2016, whereby a term of life imprisonment was substituted

to the death sentence, is contrary to Articles 12(1) and 34(1) of the Constitution

and hence is void and of no force or avail in law;

(b) The grant of the second pardon by the 11A Respondent to the 2nd Respondent

on or about 30th October 2019, whereby the 11A Respondent purported to

approve the release of the 2nd Respondent, is contrary to Articles 12(1) and 34(1)

of the Constitution and hence is void and of no force or avail in law.

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 305 of 306

708. I make the following further declarations and orders:

(1) I declare that by the grant of the impugned purported 1st and 2nd pardons by

the 11A Respondent (former President Maithripala Sirisena) has infringed the

fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioner by Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution;

(2) In consideration of the grievously abusive, irresponsible, callous and unlawful

manner in which the 11A Respondent has exercised power vested in the

President by Article 34 (1) of the Constitution on the occasion of the grant of

the purported 2nd pardon, as a deterrence measure to him and to all those

holding public office and is vested with power to exercise for specific purposes

which shall be overall in public interest, the 11A Respondent is directed to pay

a sum of Rupees One Million to the Petitioner. The Petitioner shall hold such

money in trust and spend for the purposes that are in the best interests of

female victims of crime. This sum of money shall be paid within one month of

this judgment.

(3) The Attorney-General shall forthwith with the assistance of the relevant

competent authorities set in motion a procedure aimed at locating the 2nd

Respondent and in terms of the applicable law and agreements with foreign

countries, to have him located, brought back to Sri Lanka, apprehended and be

placed back in prison to serve life imprisonment (This order is made in view of

information placed before this Court sequel to the filing of this Application,

immediately preceding this Court having made an interim order on 29th

November 2019 restraining the 2nd Respondent from leaving the country, he

had left the country, and since not returned).

It is to be noted that, though this Court has declared the impugned 1st pardon

unlawful and therefore void, given the lapse in time since the grant of such

pardon and the fact that it applied to 69 prisoners who were being detained in

Janak De Silva, J.

SC (F/R) 446/2019 JUDGMENT Page 306 of 306

the death row, exercising the just and equitable jurisdiction conferred on it

under Article 126 of the Constitution, this Court refrains from directing that

upon being located, apprehended and returned to the prison, the 2nd

Respondent be placed in the death row.

The Attorney-General shall once in every two months file a motion in Court

setting out steps taken with regard to the implementation of this direction and

the associated development.

709. The Petitioner shall be entitled to recover from 11A Respondent, costs of this litigation
