"for non-compliance with Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code"
"which mandates the requirement to describe the right of way"
"by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a"
"sufficient sketch, map or plan?"
"32.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  defendant  submitted  that,"
"according to section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code, where an action"
"relates to an interest in land, the portion of land must be described in"
"the plaint by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference"
"to a plan. It was submitted that, the plaintiff has made reference to a"
"sketch  (at  page  271  of  the  brief)  in  the  schedule  to  the  plaint.  The"
"plaintiff has also made reference to Plan bearing No. 453 (at page 294"
"of the brief). However, it was submitted that the sketch does not depict"
"an access road and it is only a site plan. It is also submitted that the"
"Plan No. 453 is not a Survey Plan, but it is compiled from Plan No. 729"
"prepared by W. Ahangama, Licensed Surveyor. The plan No.729 does"
"not show the access road in Plan 453. The Plan No. 453 has a marking"
"on it as P9 which has not been initialed by the Judge. However, what"
"is marked P9 in evidence is not a plan but a photograph (vide page 104"
"of the brief). Thus, it is questionable whether Plan No. 453 was marked"
"in evidence even though it has been referred to in the schedule to the"
"plaint to be considered in evidence. Regardless of this, it only shows a"
"path that is 6 feet wide but no servient tenement is described in the"
"plaint, in the said plan No. 453 or in the aforesaid site plan with its"
"metes and bounds."
"33. 
It  was  further  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"defendant that, when issue no. 2 was raised at the trial, the plaintiff"
"has relied entirely upon the sketch. It was submitted that the sketch"
"was marked subject to proof but the plaintiff failed to do so. Therefore,"
"issue no. 2 should have been decided on the negative."
"34.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  relied  on  the  case  of  David  V."
"Gnanawathie [2000] 2 S.L.R. 352 where the claim was dismissed for"
"non-compliance  with  section  41  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  This"
"Court has also referred to several other cases above in this judgment"
"to indicate the necessity of describing the servient tenement with its"
"metes and bounds."
"35. 
In contention to this position, the learned President’s Counsel for the"
"plaintiff submitted that, the position of non-compliance with section"
"41  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  has  been  raised  for  the  first  time  in"
"appeal  and  that  no  issue  was  raised  regarding  the  same  and  no"
