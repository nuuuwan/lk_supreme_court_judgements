"","A1 to the northern portion of Lot A1 across the southern portion of Lot"
"","A1."
"25.","It  was  further  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"","defendant that, Plan No. 3858 [P-7] (at page 53 of the brief) (the plan"
"","referred to in deed bearing No. 1365 by which the defendant became"
"","entitled to his land) does not depict any right of way. Further, the Plan"
"","P-7 depicts plaintiff’s land as Lot 3612 and the defendant’s land as Lot"
"","3611.  These  two  lots  are  shown  to  be  separated  by  a  wire  fence."
"","Therefore, it is submitted that Nalini De Silva did not convey a right of"
"","way  by  deed  No.  424  when  she  transferred  the  land  to  the  plaintiff."
"","Therefore, it was his submission that, the learned District Judge has"
"","erred in deciding that Nalini De Silva had conveyed the right of way to"
"","the  plaintiff.  However,  as  per  the  observations  made  above  by  this"
"","Court, it is clear that the learned District Judge erred with regard to"
"","the existence and proof of a right of way."
"26.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  submitted  in  his",""
"","written submissions that, the plaintiff’s predecessors reserved a strip"
"","of land as a right of way along the western boundary of Lot A2 depicted"
"","in Plan No. 973 [P-19] for the benefit of Lot A1 in the said Plan. It was"
"","submitted that, the law is clear on praedial servitudes. It is created by"
"","a deed (by a grant) the right to such servitude doesn’t simply attach to"
"","the  owner  of 
the  dominant 
tenement  personally,  but 
instead 
it"
"","becomes a part of and or a characteristic of the dominant tenement."
"","The  learned  Counsel  relied  on  Buckland’s  Manual  of  Roman  Law"
"","at page 153 and Hunter’s Roman Law which states that, praedial"
"","servitudes are regarded as attaching to the property itself rather than"
"","the  owner  of  it  and  that  servitude  passes  with  the  land  to  every"
"","possessor. This court agrees that praedial servitudes attaches to the"
"","property. However, the 5 feet right of way over Lot A2 existed only up"
"","to the southern boundary of Lot A1 which is the Northern boundary of"
"","Lot  A2.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  it  was  extended"
"","over  the  southern  portion  of  Lot  A1  after  executing  deed  No.  424  to"
"","reach the portion sold by it."
"27.","It was submitted by the learned President’s Counsel for the plaintiff"
"","that, the plaintiff by deed of transfer bearing No. 424 (at page 49 of the"
"","brief) purchased the northern portion of the Lot A1 in Plan No. 973 [P-"
"","19]  as  depicted  in  Plan  No.  3858  [P-7]  together  with  all  the  rights"
"","accrued. 
  Although  the  deed  No.  424  doesn’t  refer  to  right  way"
"","specifically, the recital of the deed included all rights, entitlements and"
"","privileges  enjoyed  by  the  predecessor  by  virtue  of  deed  No  29  [P-6]"
