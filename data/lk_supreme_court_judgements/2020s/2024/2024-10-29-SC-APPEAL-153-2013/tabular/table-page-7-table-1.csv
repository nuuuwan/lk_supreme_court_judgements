"13.  Cornelis  v.  Fernando  65  NLR  93  was a case in which the  plaintiff",""
"","claimed to be declared entitled to a right of way by prescription. It was"
"","shown  that,  between  the  plaintiff's  land  and  the  defendant's  land,"
"","there  was  an  intervening  land  over  which  the  owner  ""allowed""  the"
"","plaintiff  to  go.  It  was  held  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  finding  that  the"
"","plaintiff established a right of way by prescription over the intervening"
"","land, the Court could not grant the plaintiff a right of way through the"
"","defendant's land. Thus, to claim a right of way it is necessary for the"
"","plaintiff in the matter at hand to establish that he has a right of way"
"","over  the  balance  portion  of  aforesaid  Lot  A1  which  was  not  sold"
"","through  deed  No.  424  to  connect  with  the  right  of  way  that  existed"
"","along the western boundary of Lot A2 in Plan No.973. There exist no"
"","deed marked in evidence that creates such a right. Further, to claim"
"","such a right, no servient tenement is described in the plaint with its"
"","metes and bounds."
"14.","It must also be noted that, the plaint was filed on 08.02.1999 and the"
"","said deed No. 424 was executed in 27.01.1993. No plan was made and"
"","superimposition done to show a definite area that the plaintiff used as"
"","the right of way, especially over the balance portion of Lot A1. Hence,"
"","there cannot be more than 10 years of use over the balance portion of"
"","aforesaid Lot A1, even if it is considered that some indefinite area over"
"","the said balance portion was used to access the portion sold by deed"
"","No.424. The aforesaid indefiniteness, lack of 10 years of use, affects"
"","any prescriptive claim of a right of way over the balance portion of the"
"","said  Lot  A1.  The  said 
indefiniteness 
is 
further  confirmed  by  the"
"","plaintiff’s evidence which contradicts his claim of 6 feet wide right of"
"","way when he says in evidence that the right of way is 7 feet wide at"
"","some places, 6 feet wide at another and 5 feet wide at another place"
"","without showing it through a plan made for such purpose ( vide pages"
