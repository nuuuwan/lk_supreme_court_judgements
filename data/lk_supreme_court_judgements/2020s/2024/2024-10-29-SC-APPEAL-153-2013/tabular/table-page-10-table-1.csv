"","property  to  one  A.A.  Kareem.  The  said  Kareem  has  then  sold  the"
"","property 
in  question 
to 
the  defendant  by  deed  No.  1365  dated"
"","1993.12.03  attested  by  the  same  G.G.  Arulpragasam  Notary  Public."
"","The defendant states that, him and his predecessors in title have also"
"","acquired prescriptive title over the said property. The defendant also"
"","takes the position that, when the said property was sold to him, there"
"","existed no access road over the said land. The defendant states that"
"","the plaintiff has broken the wall along the northern boundary of the"
"","defendant’s land and had installed a small gate. Until such time the"
"","plaintiff  has  been  using  what  is  called  the  Ashtip  road  (which  was"
"","situated to the east of the defendant’s land). The defendant states that"
"","the  plaintiff  has  no  right  of  access  over  the  defendant’s  land.  The"
"","defendant further denies the position of the plaintiff in stating that it"
"","is  the  only  access  road  to  the  plaintiff’s  land  and  states  that  the"
"","plaintiff has alternate access through Ashtip road."
"20.","In this regard, this Court observes that, even the plaintiff has stated"
"","in his evidence that he did have access from the said Ashtip road for"
"","about 6 to 7 years and that his house is built facing Ashtip road. The"
"","plaintiff has also stated that there is a 15 feet wide closed gate on the"
"","side of Ashtip road (vide evidence recorded on 12.12.2001, 18.03.2002"
"","and  04.10.2002  on  pages  91,92,  100,  101,  129,  134  and  139  etc.)."
"","Further, the plaintiff also admits that the municipality has left aside"
"","an area for a 15 feet wide road way (vide page 151 of the brief). It is"
"","observed that the plaintiff attempts to state that the access from the"
"","Ashtip road was used as a temporary means of access. However, this"
"","position is questionable as he has built his house and a 15 feet wide"
"","gate facing the Ashtip road."
"21.  However, the plaintiff states that the municipality has taken over the",""
"","land  adjoining  Ashtip  road  which  was  in  between  his  land  and  the"
"","Ashtip road, in the year 1995 to build a children’s playground and the"
"","said road ceased to exist making the access road over the defendant’s"
"","land  the  only  road  that  provides  access  to  the  plaintiff’s  land.  This"
"","Court  observes  that,  if  the  plaintiff  had access  from  the  Ashtip  road"
"","and relinquished it for some reason or did not take steps to assert his"
"","right,  causing  it  to  be  lost  due  to  some  act  of  the  municipality,  the"
"","plaintiff shall not be allowed to claim a servitude of way of necessity"
"","from a different land belong to another, as it is he who deprives himself"
"","of access to a road or is responsible for the situation which made his"
