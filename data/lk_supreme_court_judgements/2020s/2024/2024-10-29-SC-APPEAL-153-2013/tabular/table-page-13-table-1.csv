"which has specifically included the said access road. The observation"
"and comments made by this Court as mentioned above are relevant in"
"considering this stance taken by the plaintiff. As explained above, the"
"said recital cannot be interpreted as an extension of the 5 feet right of"
"way that existed over Lot A2 via the new servient tenement that came"
"into existence with the execution of deed No. 424, namely the balance"
"part of Lot A1."
"28. 
It  was  further  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"plaintiff that, when the plaintiff came into possession of the northern"
"portion  of  Lot  A1  of  Plan  973  [P-19]  by  way  of  Deed  No.  424,  all"
"accretions and accessions including the servitude right of way which"
"became  bound  to  the  property  passed  to  the  plaintiff  along  with  the"
"property 
even 
if 
it  was  not 
specifically 
included.  The 
learned"
"President’s Counsel further submitted that, the subdivision of Lot A1"
"in Plan No. 973 and appellant being entitled to the southern part of"
"Lot  A1  in  Plan  No.  973  [P-19]  will  not  in  any  event  extinguish  the"
"servitude right of way accrued on the land by way of deed No. 29 [P-6]."
"As  explained  above,  that  right  has  been  extinguished  as  no  right  of"
"way was granted via the southern portion Lot A1 which was not sold"
"through the deed. Further, as explained above, the plaintiff failed to"
"prove the acquiring of the right of way by prescription or as a way of"
"necessity."
"29. 
It is clear that, in this case, no specific mention of a right of way has"
"been  made 
in  executing  the  Deed  No.  424  and  Deed  No.  1365."
"However, Deed No. 29 has specifically granted a 5 feet wide access road"
"for  the  benefit  of  Lot  A1  in  Plan  973.  Even  though,Nalini  Silva  has"
"specifically  stated  in  deed  No.  424  that  she  has  transferred  all  her"
"interests attached with the land in the schedule to the said deed to the"
"plaintiff. As explained above, this cannot be construed as creating or"
"granting a right of way via southern portion of Lot A1 which was not"
"sold."
"30.  Hence,  the  question  of  Law  No. 
(vii)  mentioned  above  has  to  be"
"answered in the affirmative."
"31.  Now I will consider the question of law (i) set out in paragraph 12 of"
"the petition."
