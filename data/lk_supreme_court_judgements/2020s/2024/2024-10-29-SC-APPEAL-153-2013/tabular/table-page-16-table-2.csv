"Civil Procedure Code. …”"
"40.  Therefore, in light of what has been discussed, it is my position that"
"the  plaintiff  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  requirement  set  out  in"
"section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code as no sufficient sketch or plan"
"which  demonstrates  the  access  road  as  claimed  by  the  plaintiff  has"
"been provided. In an instance where the access road claimed cannot"
"be  identified  with  precision,  this  Court  is  unable  to  grant  an  access"
"road as the execution of the decree and the judgment would itself be"
"impeded."
"41.  At this juncture, for the sake of completeness, I will also address the"
"aspect of right of way by necessity. The plaintiff in the instant case has"
"not clearly prayed  whether he  wants a declaration  on the grant of  a"
"right given by deeds, rights gained by prescriptive user or of a right of"
"way  by  necessity  and  neither  has  any  issue  been  clearly  raised  on"
"those grounds at the time of trial. However, the plaintiff has referred"
"to deed Nos. 8192 and 424 as deeds that conveyed a right of way and"
"right  gained  through  prescription  in  the  body  of  the  plaint 
(vide"
"paragraphs  4  to  7  of  the  plaint).  However,  in  the  plaint  he  has  in"
"certain instances stated that, he has no other way to access his land"
"(vide paragraphs 4,14 and 15). However, as explained above, without"
"describing  a  servient  tenement 
in  the  plaint  he  cannot  prove  a"
"servitude  and,  in  any  case,  if  he  has  relinquished  his  access  that"
"existed  from  the  Ashtip  road,  he  cannot  ask  for  a  right  of  way  from"
"another person’s land as a way of necessity."
"42.  Therefore, the question of law set out in paragraph 12(i) of the petition"
"is answered in the affirmative as the plaintiff has failed to comply with"
"the requirement set out in section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"43.  As explained before, the right of way mentioned in the earlier deed No."
"29  cannot  be  considered  as  existing  now,  as  there  is  no  proof  of"
"continuation  of  it  over  the  southern  portion  of  Lot  A1  as  explained"
