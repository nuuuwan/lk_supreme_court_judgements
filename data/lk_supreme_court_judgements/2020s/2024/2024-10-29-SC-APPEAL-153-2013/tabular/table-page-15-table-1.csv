"","objection was made at the trial. This Court has stated above that this"
"","is  pure  question  of  law  based  on  the  plaint  and  its  annexures  itself"
"","which does not require leading of any other evidence. It must be also"
"","noted that, affirmation of a servitude is an affirmation of a right over"
"","someone else’s property. Thus, whether there is a right of way over the"
"","property  of  the  other  person  is  the  real  subject  matter  in  question."
"","Therefore, it is necessary to describe the servient tenement in terms of"
"","section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"36.","It was submitted  by the learned President’s Counsel for the plaintiff"
"","that,  the  case  of  David  V.  Gnanawathie  [2000]  2  S.L.R.  352  is"
"","distinct from this case as the plaintiff in David(supra) failed to provide"
"","a description of the servient tenement upon which the servitude right"
"","of  way  was  claimed  by  reference  to  physical  metes  and  bounds  and"
"","also failed to provide a sufficient sketch, map or plan. However, it is"
"","the view of this Court that, as per the said decision and other decisions"
"","mentioned  before  in  this  judgment,  it  is  necessary  to  describe  the"
"","servient tenement in the plaint with its metes and bounds which the"
"","plaintiff has failed to do in this regard."
