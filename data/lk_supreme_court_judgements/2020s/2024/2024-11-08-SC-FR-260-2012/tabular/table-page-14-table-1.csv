"n Kapugeekiyana v Hettiarachchi [1984] 2 SLR 153, this Court has observed that;"
"“In  deciding  whether  any  particular  fundamental  right  has  been  infringed  I"
"would  apply  the  test  laid  down  in Velmurugu (above)  that  the  civil,  and  not  the"
"criminal  standard  of  persuasion  applies,  with  this  observation,  that  the  nature"
"and  gravity  of  an  issue  must  necessarily  determine  the  manner  of  attaining"
"reasonable satisfaction of the truth of that issue.” (at page 165)"
