"falling within the ambit of Article 11 of the Constitution, whilst in the custody of the"
"police officers."
"N
onetheless, it is  also pertinent  to  note that the failure on the part of the 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents  to  sufficiently  explain  fully  the  sequence  of  events  and  circumstances"
"surrounding the four hour period during which the victim was held in the custody of"
"the police station, including any steps they took to address the suffering of the victim"
"have to be considered with sufficient weight in attributing responsibility for causing"
"cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment that would amount to a violation of the rights"
"guaranteed  under  Article  11.  As  I  have  enumerated  hereinbefore,  the  1st  and  the  2nd"
"Respondents had a duty to treat that victim with due care and attention and ensure his"
"safety  whilst  being  in  their  custody.  The  two  Respondents  failed  to  discharge  their"
"burden to establish before this Court that they did in fact satisfactorily discharged the"
"duty placed on them in the given circumstances."
"W
hen  all  these  factors  are  taken  cumulatively,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Respondents have infringed the rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution."
"There  is  also  no  doubt  that  the  two  Respondents  have  acted  in  the  colour  of  their"
"office at the time such violations took place."
"T
aking  into  account  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  series  of  events  commencing  from"
"the  arrest  and  the  subsequent  death  on  the  next  of  kin  of  the  victim,  specially,  the"
"events  leading  to  the  infringement  of  the  protection  guaranteed  to  the  victim  under"
"Article 11 of the Constitution, due to the wrongful conduct of the two Respondents as"
"enumerated  hereinbefore,  it  is  just  and  equitable  for  this  Court  to  grant  relief  to  the"
"Petitioners."

he  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  who  represented  6th  to  the  9th  Respondents"
