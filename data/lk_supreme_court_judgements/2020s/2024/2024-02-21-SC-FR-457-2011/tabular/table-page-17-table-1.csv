"D
istinction between active service and an unblemished period of service"
"I
 must state at this point that an unblemished period of service must not be confused with"
"the  first  requirement  of  eight  years  of  active  service.  The  Inspector  General  of  Police"
"appears to have done just that, contrary to the instructions given by his facsimile message"
"of 18th February 2010 that the period of no-pay leave would apply only with regard to the"
"calculation  of  the  eight  years  of  active  service.  Therefore,  the  period  for  which  the"
"Petitioner did not receive his wages as a result of being under interdiction would only"
"apply with regard to the first requirement of active service and cannot be applied to the"
"second  requirement  of  unblemished  service,  unless  of  course  the  reason  for  the  non-"
"payment of wages arises out of a disciplinary order, which is not the situation in this case."
