"Bad Conduct Register amounts to a punishment, which had been imposed without any"
"disciplinary proceedings being held against him."
"O
n 22nd June 2006, prior to the said Fundamental Rights application being considered by"
"this Court, the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Attorney General"
"had undertaken to obtain instructions on whether the above entries could be removed"
"from  the  Bad  Conduct  Register.  Having  done  so,  this  Court  had  been  informed  by  the"
"Attorney  General  on  21st  August  2006  that,  “he  has  received 
instructions  from  the"
"Respondents that the notation in P32 would be expunged, subject to the condition that"
"the petitioner would not be entitled to back wages for the period under interdiction.” On"
"this basis, proceedings in the above application had been terminated."
"T
he effect of the above undertaking is that the interdiction of the Petitioner from service"
"did  not  result 
in  any  adverse  findings  against  the  Petitioner  and  the  period  under"
"interdiction was not considered as a period of no-pay leave, even though the Petitioner"
"was not paid any wages for that period. The distinction between no-pay leave and non-"
"payment  of  back  wages  has  been  considered  by  this  Court  in  Tuan  Ishan  Raban  and"
"Others v The Police Commission [(2007) 2 Sri LR 351], to which I shall advert, later in this"
"judgment."
"E

"Petitioner. The following two paragraphs of the internal communication dated 27th June"
"2006 sent by the Director (Discipline and Enforcement) to the Commandant of the Field"
"Force  Headquarters  soon  after  proceedings  were 
terminated,  clearly
