"requirement of five years of unblemished service was applicable even for absorption from"
"the Reserve Force to the Regular Force, and the fact that the Petitioner was absorbed to"
"the Regular Force on 13th July 2007, in spite of being under interdiction for a period of"
"little over one and half years preceding the said absorption, demonstrates that the Police"
"Department did not consider the period under interdiction as a blemish on the service"
"record of the Petitioner. The argument simply put is that the Inspector General of Police"
