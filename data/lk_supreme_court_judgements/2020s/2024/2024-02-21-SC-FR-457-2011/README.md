Before: Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J Achala Wengappuli, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Saliya Peiris, PC, with Anjana Ratnasiri for the Petitioner

Rajiv Goonetilleke, Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents Argued on: 25th October 2021 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 15th July 2022 Submissions:

Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 15th November 2021 Decided on: 21st February 2024

Obeyesekere, J

In this application, the Petitioner is impugning the decision of the Inspector General of

Police not to promote him as an Inspector of Police for the reason that he did not possess

five years of unblemished service as at 8th February 2010. The issue that needs to be

determined by this Court is whether the said decision of the Inspector General of Police

is justifiable in terms of the criteria for promotion.

Institution of proceedings against the Petitioner

The Petitioner joined the Reserve Force of the Sri Lanka Police Department as a Sub-

Inspector on 30th August 1992. In 1998, he was assigned to the Opanayake Police Station,

and assumed duties at the Kahawatte Police Station in October 2002. The Petitioner

states that while serving at Opanayake, he had apprehended a large number of persons

on charges of brewing illicit liquor, and instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court

against such persons in respect thereof. On 29th May 2002, one of the persons so

apprehended had lodged a belated complaint with the Superintendent of Police,

Ratnapura alleging that on 12th May 2001, the Petitioner had solicited and accepted from

him a gratification in a sum of Rs. 1000. The said person had also lodged a complaint with

6

the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption [the Commission] in

respect of the same matter.

Having recorded a statement from the Petitioner, the Commission had initiated

proceedings against him in the Magistrates Court of Colombo under the provisions of the

Bribery Act. As a result of the institution of the above action, the Petitioner had been

interdicted from service with effect from 20th September 2004, as required by Section

31:1:4 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code [the Code].

The trial in the Magistrates Court had commenced on 26th May 2005. While the

prosecution had led the evidence of three witnesses, the Petitioner had given evidence

on his own behalf. By judgment delivered on 30th June 2005, the learned Magistrate had

acquitted the Petitioner of all charges levelled against him.

Reinstatement in service

Pursuant to his acquittal, the Petitioner had sought to be reinstated in service.

Section 28:6 of Chapter XLVIII of the Code provides that the acquittal of an officer by a

Court of Law is not a bar to disciplinary proceedings being taken against such officer under

the Code for the same offence, provided there is sufficient material to do so. However,

by his letter dated 21st December 2005, the Superintendent of Police, Ratnapura had

confirmed that further disciplinary proceedings would not be taken against the Petitioner

in respect of the above incident. The inference that can be drawn from the said decision

of the Superintendent of Police is that the material that was available was insufficient for

the Police Department to initiate such disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner.

While noting that the Petitioner had been acquitted by the Magistrates Court, the Police

message issued by the Inspector General of Police reinstating the Petitioner in service on

7th April 2006, contained inter alia the following conditions:

By way of a further message dated 25th April 2006, the Senior Superintendent of Police,

Ratnapura, had informed the Officer-in-Charge of the Kahawatte Police that the

Petitioner has been reinstated in service, subject to the following conditions specified in

the above message of the Inspector General of Police:

(a) The period the Petitioner was not in service to be considered as a period of no-pay

leave;

(b) The Petitioner to undergo training at the Police Training Institute and to be attached

to the Police Field Force Headquarters after the said training;

(c) A file to be maintained relating to the work and conduct of the Petitioner for a period

of two years.

Fundamental Rights Application No. 188/2016

The above three conditions had thereafter been entered in the Bad Conduct Register

relating to the Petitioner. Aggrieved by the decision to reinstate him without back wages

and the decision to make the above endorsements on the Bad Conduct Register, the

Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 126 of the

Constitution by way of a petition dated 26th May 2006 in SC (FR) Application No.

188/2006.

The Petitioner had specifically pleaded therein that he possessed an unblemished service

record, that no disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against him, and that he had

not been punished for any offence during his period of service. The gravamen of the

Petitioners complaint to this Court was that the insertion of the above conditions in the

8

Bad Conduct Register amounts to a punishment, which had been imposed without any

disciplinary proceedings being held against him.

On 22nd June 2006, prior to the said Fundamental Rights application being considered by

this Court, the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Attorney General

had undertaken to obtain instructions on whether the above entries could be removed

from the Bad Conduct Register. Having done so, this Court had been informed by the

Attorney General on 21st August 2006 that, he has received instructions from the

Respondents that the notation in P32 would be expunged, subject to the condition that

the petitioner would not be entitled to back wages for the period under interdiction. On

this basis, proceedings in the above application had been terminated.

The effect of the above undertaking is that the interdiction of the Petitioner from service

did not result in any adverse findings against the Petitioner and the period under

interdiction was not considered as a period of no-pay leave, even though the Petitioner

was not paid any wages for that period. The distinction between no-pay leave and non-

payment of back wages has been considered by this Court in Tuan Ishan Raban and

Others v The Police Commission [(2007) 2 Sri LR 351], to which I shall advert, later in this

judgment.

Expunging the entries in the Bad Conduct Register

By the time the above undertaking was given to this Court, the Police Department had

already initiated steps to expunge the above entries from the Bad Conduct Register of the

Petitioner. The following two paragraphs of the internal communication dated 27th June

2006 sent by the Director (Discipline and Enforcement) to the Commandant of the Field

Force Headquarters soon after proceedings were terminated, clearly reflects the

understanding of the Police Department on the relief that was sought by, and granted to

the Petitioner:

The above communication had been acted upon by the deletion of the impugned entries

from the Bad Conduct Register on 14th July 2006. It should perhaps be reiterated that the

deletion of the said entries clearly meant that the institution of proceedings in the

Magistrates Court and the subsequent interdiction did not result in any adverse findings

against the conduct of the Petitioner.

Absorption of Officers of the Reserve Force to the Regular Force

In early 2006, during which time the Petitioner was still under interdiction, the Cabinet of

Ministers had taken a decision to absorb all those serving in the Reserve Force of the

Police Department to the Regular Force, with effect from 24th February 2006. Although

the Cabinet Memorandum and the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers have not been

made available to this Court, the memorandum circulated within the Police Department

in this regard stipulated that those in the Reserve Force must have inter alia the following

qualifications:

(a) Basic academic qualifications applicable to the Regular Force or eight years of

active service;

(b) An unblemished period of service for a period of five years preceding 31st

December 2005;

(c) While only the active period of service will be counted, any period under

suspension or demobilization will be deducted when calculating the number of

years in active service.

10

The said memorandum also stipulated that:

(a) An officer who had been ordered by Court to pay compensation in a fundamental

rights application or awarded punishment in a disciplinary proceeding during the

five-year period preceding 31st December 2005 will be treated as having a blemished

record;

(b) Reservists who are suspended from service will be considered for absorption

provided inter alia their absorption is recommended by the Commandant of the

Police Reserve;

(c) Those who are not eligible due to pending cases in Courts and disciplinary inquiries

will be kept in a reserve list until such time the inquiries are completed and will be

absorbed depending on the outcome of the inquiry.

It is therefore clear that:

(a) An unblemished service meant that no punishment had been imposed pursuant to

the findings of a disciplinary inquiry or has not been ordered to pay compensation

in a fundamental rights application;

(b) Any period under suspension or de-mobilisation would only affect the period of

active service that was required for absorption; and

(c) Any period under suspension had no nexus to the requirement to have an

unblemished record of service.

It is admitted that the Petitioner was absorbed to the Regular Force of the Sri Lanka Police

on 13th July 2007, which means that the Petitioner possessed the aforementioned

qualifications including an unblemished period of service for a period of five years

preceding 31st December 2005. More importantly, his absorption demonstrates that the

interdiction of the Petitioner and the fact that he was not in active service as a result

thereof during the period of five years immediately preceding the operative date, were

not considered a blemish on his service for the purposes of absorption.

11

Promotion of all Sub-Inspectors of Police

The issue that culminated in this application arose in February 2010, when the President

ordered that all Sub-Inspectors of Police who had completed eight years of service as at

8th February 2010 in the rank of Sub-Inspector be promoted to the rank of Inspector of

Police with effect from the said date. Similar to what was stipulated at the time of the

aforementioned absorption, promotion was subject to each officer having eight years of

active service and an unblemished record during the five-year period immediately before

the date of promotion.

By a message dated 17th February 2010, the Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations)

had called for a report from the Officer-in-Charge of the Kahawatte Police relating to the

disciplinary records of six Officers including the Petitioner. By a further message sent on

18th February 2010, which appears to be based on a facsimile message sent the same day

by the Inspector General of Police, the following instructions had been issued with regard

to the calculation of the period of eight years of service:

jir 08 l fiajd ld,h .kka .ekSfuSoS my; mrsos ls%hd l, hq;=h

01. Wm fmd,sia mrslaIl ;k;+rg m;a lsrsfuka miq fiajh w;yer f.dia we;akus tu ld,h Wm fmd,sia mrslaIl ;k;+fra uq,q fiajd ld,fhka wvq l, hq;=hs.

fiajd lvjSus we;akus tu ld, mrspsfPao ioyka l, hq;= w;r ikd: lsrsug wod, f,aLk

;Sfnskus tho bosrsm;a lsrsug lghq;= l, hq;=hs

Thus, it is clear that the Inspector General of Police was of the view that any period of no-

pay leave would be relevant only in respect of the calculation of the eight years of active

service that was required for promotion.

In response, the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ratnapura, by letter dated 29th June

2010 had confirmed that the Petitioner has not had any disciplinary issues during the

preceding five-year period and that his promotion was being recommended.

12

Petitioner is not granted his promotion

On 31st December 2010, the Inspector General of Police had issued a list containing the

names of those Sub-Inspectors of Police who had been promoted to the rank of Inspector

of Police pursuant to the aforementioned order of the President. Aggrieved by the

decision not to include his name on the said list of promotees, the Petitioner had lodged

a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on 26th January 2011.

In his response to the Human Rights Commission, the Director (Legal) of Sri Lanka Police

had stated as follows:

by; fldkafoaiska wNsfhad.hg m;a lruska ks<Odrshd jsiska wxl 188/2006 hgf;a

Thus, the contention of the Police Department was that the Petitioner did not possess

five years of unblemished service prior to 8th February 2010, for the reason that he was

on no-pay leave during the period he was under interdiction [i.e., 20th September 2004

7th April 2006]. I must state that this position was factually incorrect as the Inspector

General of Police represented by the Attorney General had agreed before this Court in

the previous Fundamental Rights application not to treat the said period as a period of

no-pay leave, despite the Petitioner agreeing that he would not be entitled to the

payment of back wages.

13

Alleged infringement of Article 12(1)

Pursuant to the above response to the Human Rights Commission, the Petitioner filed this

application on 3rd October 2011 complaining that the decision not to grant him his

promotion is an infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. On 12th January 2012, this Court had granted leave to proceed for the

alleged violation of Article 12(1).

In Karunathilaka and Another v Jayalath de Silva and Others [(2003) 1 Sri LR 35 at pages

41-42] it was observed as follows:

The basic principle governing the concept of equality is to remove unfairness and

arbitrariness. It profoundly forbids actions, which deny equality and thereby

become discriminative. The hallmark of the concept of equality is to ensure that

fairness is meted out. Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which governs the principles

of equality, approves actions which have a reasonable basis for the decision and

this Court has not been hesitant to accept those as purely valid decisions.

The concept of equality therefore forbids action which is arbitrary and capricious. A

determination by this Court that the right to equality guaranteed to the Petitioner by

Article 12(1) has been violated would therefore have to be preceded by a finding that the

aforementioned decision of the Inspector General of Police is unreasonable and unfair

and is therefore arbitrary.

Does the Petitioner have eight years of service?

There were only two requirements that had to be satisfied by a Sub-Inspector of Police

who was in service on 8th February 2010 to be entitled for promotion to the rank of

Inspector of Police. The first was that the Officer should have completed eight years of

service in the rank of Sub-Inspector as at that date. It was the position of the Respondents,

as borne out by the affidavit filed before this Court by the Inspector General of Police and

the written submissions filed on their behalf, that:

14

(a) The National Police Commission has decided that the period of service in the

Reserve Force could be aggregated with the period of service in the Regular Force

after absorption;

(b) Therefore, the eight years of service need not be after absorption to the Regular

Force;

(c) The requirement of eight years of service need not be eight years of continuous

service;

(d) Even after discounting the break in service due to his interdiction, the Petitioner had

almost sixteen years of service and had satisfied the requirement of having eight

years of service required for promotion.

Thus, there is no dispute between the parties with regard to the first requirement. The

position taken up by the Respondents is consistent with the judgment of this Court in

R.A.S.R Kulatunga v Pujitha Jayasundera, Inspector General of Police and Others [SC (FR)

Application No. 132/2014; SC Minutes of 18th March 2021] where it was held that, giving

due regard to the period of active service in the Reserve Force in the rank of Inspector of

Police in deciding whether an applicant had completed eight years of active service in the

rank of Inspector of Police is neither arbitrary nor irrational.

Does the Petitioner have an unblemished period of service of five years?

The second requirement that must be satisfied in order to be promoted as an Inspector

of Police is that the Petitioner should have an unblemished record of service during the

five-year period immediately prior to the date of promotion of 8th February 2010, with

the Inspector General of Police claiming that the Petitioner did not possess the said

requirement, and hence is not eligible for promotion.

It was submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General that the Code does not contain

a definition of unblemished service. The plain and simple dictionary meaning of the word

blemish appropriate to the present circumstances is, to impair morally or to cast a slur on

the honour and reputation of an individual. This Court would therefore have to consider

15

the attendant circumstances in determining whether the Petitioner possessed an

unblemished service.

The Code contains detailed provisions relating to the taking of disciplinary proceedings

against public officers. Section 1:2 of Chapter XLVIII of the Code stipulates that, All acts

of misconduct or lapse by officers calling for punishment in any form should be dealt with,

under these rules, as soon as possible, by the Disciplinary Authorities, Heads of

Departments and other relevant Heads of Institutions. The step-by-step procedure that

should be followed in order to impose a punishment provided in the Code is contained in

Chapter XLVIII. The major punishments set out in Section 24:3 of Chapter XLVIII could be

imposed by the Disciplinary Authority only upon the findings of a formal disciplinary

inquiry that has been conducted pursuant to the issuance of a charge sheet. This extends

to the decision with regard to the payment of arrears of salary for the period an officer

was under interdiction vide Section 31:14.

I shall now consider the position of the Respondents. In his affidavit to this Court, the

Inspector General of Police has stated the following as being the reasons why the

Petitioner was not entitled to be promoted in 2010:

(a) The period the petitioner was out of service cannot be considered as active

service and no salary has been paid to the Petitioner for the said period;

(b) It is not possible to deem that the Petitioners service was unblemished

during the period he was not in service as it is necessary to be in active service

in order to determine whether the relevant period was unblemished or not;

(c) A period a person is out of service cannot be construed as a period of

unblemished service as there had been no opportunity to assess his service;

(d) The Petitioner was not entitled to back wages for the period he was out of

service and that too is indicative of the fact that the said period is not an

unblemished period of service;

16

(e) Therefore, the Petitioner did not possess an unblemished record during the five-

year period immediately before the date of promotion. [emphasis added]

Payment of wages to an Officer of the Reserve Force

As noted earlier, the Petitioner did not receive any wages for the period that he was under

interdiction, with the Petitioner conceding in the Fundamental Rights application filed by

him that he is not entitled to the payment of back wages. The position of the

Respondents, as I understand, is that as the Petitioner did not receive a salary for the

period under interdiction, the said period cannot be considered as being a period of active

service, and that the period the Petitioner was not in active service cannot be construed

as a period of unblemished service as there had been no opportunity to assess his service.

In Tuan Ishan Raban and Others v The Police Commission [supra], this Court observed

that it is apparent from Section 26B(1) of the Police Ordinance that Officers of the Reserve

Force were paid on a daily basis for the reason that such Officers could be mobilised and

de-mobilised from time to time, and therefore such Officers were not in continuous

service. Although provision was made in 1992 for Officers of the Reserve Force to be paid

a monthly salary, this was subject to the period of their mobilised service being not less

than 26 days for a calendar month. The fact remained therefore that an officer in the

Reserve Force was entitled to wages only if he was in active service, and therefore the

question of placing an Officer of the Reserve Force such as the Petitioner in this case on

no-pay leave while he was not in active service simply does not arise. The fact that wages

were not paid during such period an Officer of the Reserve Force was not mobilised

certainly does not mean that the said period is of blemished service.

Thus, the Petitioner being an Officer of the Reserve Force, and not having been on active

service during the period of 20th September 2004 7th April 2006, was not entitled to the

payment of wages for the said period. This was perhaps the logic behind the Petitioner

agreeing before this Court in the previous application that he was not entitled to the

payment of back wages. Furthermore, the Petitioner not having been on active service

during the above period is not sufficient by itself for the Respondents to claim that the

said period is of blemished service.

17

Distinction between active service and an unblemished period of service

I must state at this point that an unblemished period of service must not be confused with

the first requirement of eight years of active service. The Inspector General of Police

appears to have done just that, contrary to the instructions given by his facsimile message

of 18th February 2010 that the period of no-pay leave would apply only with regard to the

calculation of the eight years of active service. Therefore, the period for which the

Petitioner did not receive his wages as a result of being under interdiction would only

apply with regard to the first requirement of active service and cannot be applied to the

second requirement of unblemished service, unless of course the reason for the non-

payment of wages arises out of a disciplinary order, which is not the situation in this case.

Under the Code as well as the Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission, the

entitlement to promotion is conditional upon the criteria in the relevant service minute

being satisfied and the public officer earning his salary increments. The learned Deputy

Solicitor General has drawn the attention of this Court to the requirement in Rule 186 of

the Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission, which reads as follows:

A Public Officer must earn his promotion by a satisfactory service and fulfilment of

all the required qualifications prescribed in the Service Minute or the Scheme of

Recruitment.

(i) Satisfactory service means a period of service, during which period an officer

had earned all annual salary increments that fall due, by efficient and diligent

discharge of duties, by passing over efficiency bars that fall due, by qualifying

for confirmation in service that fall and during which period he has not

committed a punishable offence.

(ii) Where an officer has not been granted his due annual salary increments for

legitimate reason the period during which the increment had stand suspended,

reduced, stopped or deferred and where an officer had committed a punishable

offence falling under Schedule I of offences, a period of three years from the

18

date of commission of the offences and where an officer had committed a

punishable offence falling under the Schedule II of offences a period of one year

from the date of commission of the offence, shall be excluded in computing his

period of satisfactory service.

The above rule makes it clear that a public officer must earn his promotion inter alia by

satisfactory service which once again means a period of active service during which all

salary increments are earned by the efficient and diligent discharge of his duties. The fact

that a public officer fails to earn such increments may be due to a variety of reasons and

even though it may affect the period of years in active service, given the circumstances of

this case, such failure does not mean that such officers service is blemished. Nor can it

be applied to a situation where the increments have not been earned for no fault of the

public officer concerned, as in this application.

Furthermore, no fault can be attributed to the Petitioner for him not having five years of

consecutive service from 8th February 2005. Therefore, if as the Inspector General of

Police claims, a period of five years service had to be assessed in order to determine if

the services of the Petitioner were unblemished, the Respondents could very well have

considered the five years of active service that the Petitioner possessed immediately prior

to 8th February 2010, leaving out the period under interdiction. Taking into consideration

all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the explanation offered to this Court

by the Inspector General of Police is irrational and the decision of the Inspector General

of Police is arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed

by Article (12). I therefore reject the said explanation.

No formal disciplinary proceedings

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that even though the

Petitioner was under interdiction as at 8th February 2005 which under normal

circumstances should have been the commencement date in calculating the five-year

period for the purpose of unblemished service the Petitioner was subsequently

acquitted of all charges levelled against him and the Police Department had taken a

conscious decision not to proceed with any disciplinary action, although such a course of

19

action was available to the Police Department under the provisions of the Code. He

therefore submitted that, having decided not to proceed with disciplinary action, the

Police Department cannot claim that the service of the Petitioner is nonetheless

blemished as a result of the said incident and subsequent interdiction by drawing a nexus

to the non-payment of wages for that period. I am in agreement with this submission and

take the view that not having pursued disciplinary action as provided for by the Code, the

Police Department has no basis to claim that the Petitioners service is blemished, or in

other words, that the said incident has cast a slur on the honour and reputation of the

Petitioner.

Deletion of entries from the Bad Conduct Register

The second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

decision of the Police Department to record the three conditions in the Bad Conduct

Register, including the condition that the period under interdiction must be treated as a

period of no-pay leave, was challenged by the Petitioner in the aforementioned

Fundamental Rights application and that the Police Department had agreed to revoke

that decision and remove the said entries from the Bad Conduct Register.

The consequence of this deletion is three-fold. The first is that there are no entries in the

Bad Conduct Register and therefore it cannot be said that the Petitioners service record

is blemished. The second is that no adverse conclusion could be drawn by the fact that

the Petitioner was under interdiction. The third is that the Police Department has agreed

that the period the Petitioner was under interdiction was not a period of no-pay leave,

even though the Petitioner had agreed that he will not be entitled for the payment of

wages during that period. As I have observed earlier, as an Officer of the Reserve Force,

the Petitioner had no entitlement for the payment of wages for the period that he was

not in active service. I am of the view that having agreed in this Court to remove the three

entries from the Bad Conduct Register of the Petitioner, it smacks of bad faith on the part

of the Inspector General of Police to thereafter claim that the Petitioner does not have an

unblemished service record.

20

Identical requirement for absorption

The third argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

requirement of five years of unblemished service was applicable even for absorption from

the Reserve Force to the Regular Force, and the fact that the Petitioner was absorbed to

the Regular Force on 13th July 2007, in spite of being under interdiction for a period of

little over one and half years preceding the said absorption, demonstrates that the Police

Department did not consider the period under interdiction as a blemish on the service

record of the Petitioner. The argument simply put is that the Inspector General of Police

is estopped from claiming that the services of the Petitioner are blemished.

As the Inspector General of Police now claims, if the Petitioner cannot have an

unblemished period of service as a result of not being able to assess his performance

during the period under interdiction, he owed a duty to this Court to explain the reason

for the non-consideration of the period of interdiction when the Petitioner was absorbed

to the Regular Force. Neither the Inspector General of Police nor the other Respondents

have done that nor have they sought to draw a distinction in the requirement for an

unblemished service between the absorption and the promotion. I am therefore in

agreement with the said argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

and take the view that the impugned decision of the Inspector General of Police is

irrational and arbitrary and is violative of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 12(1).

Conclusion

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I hold that the impugned

decision of the Inspector General of Police to deny the Petitioner his promotion to

Inspector of Police on 8th February 2010 is irrational and arbitrary and that the Inspector

General of Police has infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by

Article 12(1).

21

At the hearing of this application, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

informed this Court that, (a) the Petitioner has been promoted as an Inspector of Police

on 1st July 2019, and (b) if this Court were to hold with the Petitioner, the Petitioner is

agreeable to be placed at the end of the list of those promoted to the rank of Inspector

of Police on 8th February 2010.

I accordingly direct the Respondents [i.e., the Inspector General of Police and the National

Police Commission] to back date the promotion of the Petitioner to the rank of Inspector

of Police to 8th February 2010 and to place the Petitioner at the end of the list of those

who were promoted as Inspectors of Police on 8th February 2010. The Petitioner shall be

entitled to the payment of back wages in the rank of Inspector of Police and to all other

entitlements of an Inspector of Police from 8th February 2010, in accordance with the law

and other applicable Rules and Circulars.

I make no order with regard to costs.
