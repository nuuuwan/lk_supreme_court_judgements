"K
arande  Kankanamge  Sanath  Chandraratna.  Heenkenda  Mudiyanselage  Punchi  Bandara"
"Heenkenda, who  is said to have   signed  as  a witness to the Power of Attorney  is  also  the"
"Notary Public who is said to have attested the Deed of Transfer (P3). Although the Plaintiff"
"had called the said witness (Heenkenda Mudiyanselage Punchi Bandara Heenkenda), to give"
"evidence  on  his  behalf,  it  is  significant  that,  during  his  oral  testimony,  the  said  witness"
"(Heenkenda  Mudiyanselage  Punchi  Bandara  Heenkenda),  did  not  give  any  evidence  with"
"regard to the execution of the said Power of Attorney (P2), but only gave evidence in respect"
"of the execution of the Deed of Transfer (P3). Indeed, the learned Counsel who had appeared"
"for the Plaintiff had not asked a single question from this witness as to whether or not he"
"stood  and  signed  as  a  witness  to  the  execution  of  the  said  Power  of  Attorney  (P2)."
"Accordingly, the said Heenkenda Mudiyanselage Punchi Bandara Heenkendaâ€™s evidence is not"
"of any use or relevance to prove the due execution of the impugned Power of Attorney. The"
"Plaintiff did not call the only other person who is said to have signed as a witness to the said"
"Power of Attorney (Karande Kankanamge Sanath Chandraratna) to give evidence in this case"
"on his behalf. Therefore, I have to conclude that the Plaintiff has not established that said"
"Olivia Suranganie Ranasinghe had signed and executed the purported Power of Attorney (P2)"
"which the Defendant has impugned in this case."
