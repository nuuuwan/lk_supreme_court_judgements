"In Sirajudeen vs. Abbas [1994] 2 SLR 365 G.P.S. De Silva C.J. cited with approval the"
"following passage from Walter Pereira’s Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition, page 396,"
"“As regards the mode of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses"
"that  the  plaintiff  possessed  the  land  in  dispute  for  a  number  of  years  exceeding  the"
"prescriptive  period  are  not  evidence  of  the  uninterrupted  and  adverse  possession"
"necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses speak to"
"specific facts, and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by court”."
"The  Commission  Plan  No.  9189  depicts  the  illegal  construction  of  the  Defendant-"
"Respondent projecting on top of the common facilities on the said Lot 17. This fact is"
"further  established  by  the  evidence  of  the  2nd  Plaintiff-Appellant.  The  Defendant-"
"Respondent  has  denied  the  existence  of  an  obtrusive  construction  over  the  common"
"amenities and disputes the findings of the  Licensed  Surveyor, however has failed  to"
"sufficiently identify the portion of land claimed on prescriptive title. The Defendant-"
"Respondent claims to have rights over the said Lot 17. No commission was sought by"
"the Defendant-Respondent to identify the said portion of land that he alleged to have"
"prescribed to. If the Defendant-Respondent is seeking a right contemplated by section"
"3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  then  he  must  necessarily  establish  that  right  over  a"
"defined and identifiable area of land, which he has failed to do."
"It is also observed that the Defendant-Respondent’s and his mother’s evidence before"
"the  trial  court  lacks  clarity  as  to  the  starting  point  of  possessing,  and  occupying  the"
"premises adversely. The mother of the Defendant-Respondent makes a vague statement"
"that the house was constructed in 29/10/1995 and the Defendant-Respondent possessed"
"the  land  in  dispute  from  at  least  1989.    To  establish  soil  rights  by  prescription,  it  is"
"necessary  that  the  witnesses  speak  to  clearly  defined  and  distinct  facts  which  would"
"enable the court to arrive at a finding of uninterrupted and adverse possession. General"
"statements  which  lack  coherence  do  not  carry  any  probative  value  in  support  of"
"prescriptive title. In the instant case, there is no sound evidence before us in regard to"
"the period of possession of the portion of land by the Defendant-Respondent and this"
