"Respondent’s mother acquired title to the said land by virtue of purported Deed No. 08"
"dated 20/01/2004. These Deeds have been executed 8 to 9 months prior to the institution"
"of this action.  According to the Defendant-Respondent’s evidence, the said Deed No."
"08 (which was not produced in evidence) is a Deed of declaration executed based on"
"long-term adverse possession. The learned Additional District Judge observed that, the"
"said Deed marked V1  under which  the  Defendant claims  legal  title  do not show the"
"existence of any right  over the Plaintiff’s land and therefore has failed to prove any"
"entitlement, by prescription over the said land.  Since the court was satisfied that the"
"Defendant-Respondent did not succeed in establishing prescription by legal title, the"
"court then proceeded to decide the question of entitlement by virtue of undisturbed, and"
"uninterrupted adverse possession."
"The Defendant-Respondent stated that in 1998 he came into permanent residence of the"
"said premises and thereafter had developed the existing construction in mid-2004. Apart"
"from the said Deed of Gift No.09, (attested 8 months prior to the institution of these"
"proceedings)  the  Defendant-Respondent  led  in  evidence  the  birth  certificates  of  his"
"three children who were born while he was in residence of the said premises in 1997,"
"1999  and  2002  marked  V3,  V4  and  V5  respectively,  as  valid  proof  to  establish"
"prescriptive possession. The Defendant-Appellant also relied on document marked V6"
"(a document which remain subject to proof) termed as a second copy of the receipt No."
"9548  dated  25/03/1973,  issued  by  the  Colombo  Municipal  Council  indicating  the"
"address of the said premise."
"The  testimony  given  by  the  Defendant-Respondent’s  mother  was  that  she  and  her"
"brother was in occupation of premises No, 127/34, since 1980 and after the death of her"
"brother  in  the  year  2000,  the  premises  were  given  to  the  Defendant-Respondent."
"However, she did not testify to the existence of the said Deed of declaration No. 09 on"
"which the Defendant-Respondent has relied on to establish long term legal title."
"Saliya Wickramasinghe, Licensed Surveyor, in his evidence before the trial court states"
"that the two storied construction built by the Defendant-Respondent protrudes to Lot"
