"Conclusion of the Court"
"I am of the view that the learned trial Judge had correctly come to the conclusion"
"when  he  concluded  that  the  Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant  had  established  the"
"contractual 
relationship  between  Plaintiff  and  Defendant 
in 
rejecting 
the"
"Defendant’s  claim  on  prescriptive 
title.  However, 
the 
learned 
Judge  has"
"committed a serious error in dismissing the Plaintiff’s action on the basis that he"
"failed to identify the land when the identification of the land was not in question."
"The learned Judge of the High Court, too, has failed to duly appraise this element."
"Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  judgment  entered  in  the  High  Court  of  Civil"
"Appeal dismissing the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant is incorrect in"
"law  and  in  fact.  In  these  circumstances,  I  find  merit  in  this  application  and"
"accordingly allow this Appeal."
"I direct the learned District Court Judge to enter the judgment for the Plaintiff as"
"prayed for in paras (a) and (b) of the prayer to the plaint."
"The Plaintiff is entitled to costs."
"Appeal allowed with costs."
