"Appellant-Appellant submitted that the Plaintiff comes to Court on the basis that the"
"Defendant is her licensee who has acted in violation of her rights as the Defendant has"
"not vacated and given vacant possession when the said license was terminated."
"Moreover, as per paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff"
"stated that the Defendant worked on the land as a lessee and that he looked after the"
"property while residing in the building constructed on the said land by her family. The"
"Plaintiff  by  producing  P16,  P17  and  P18  (payment  receipts  of  money  for  plucking"
"coconuts), submitted that the Defendant had worked for her family for a long time."
"The  documents  were  produced  to  show  the  relationship  that  the  Defendant  had  in"
"1981,  1982  and  1983  with  one  Agrapala  who  became  the  owner  in  1974.  It  was"
"submitted  that  the  said  Agrapala  is  the  predecessor  in  title  of  the  Plaintiff  and  the"
"Plaintiff became entitled to the land in 1996 by virtue of the Deed marked P15."
"The  Defendant  did  not  lodge  a  cross-appeal  at  the  High  Court  on  the  issue  of"
"Prescription and license which were held against him by the learned District Judge; nor"
"has  he  raised  a  question  of  law  before  this  Court  on  the  issue  of  Prescription."
"Furthermore, at the trial, the Plaintiff’s title deeds were marked and accepted without"
"challenge  and  it  was  proven  that  the  Plaintiff  has  sufficient  title  over  the  land  in"
"question."
"As such, no question with regard to prescription  arises in the instant Appeal before"
"this court as I have already noted and the findings of the learned District Judge as to"
"the prescriptive title of the Defendant need not be disturbed at this stage."
"The questions of law set out in this case directly relate to the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s"
"action by the learned District Judge, which as I noted previously, was done on the sole"
"basis that the Plaintiff did not identify the land."
