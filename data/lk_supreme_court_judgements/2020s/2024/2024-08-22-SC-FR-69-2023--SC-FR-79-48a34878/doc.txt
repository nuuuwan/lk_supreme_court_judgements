The above applications Nos. SC FR 69/2023, SC FR 79/2023, SC FR 90/2023 and SC FR

139/2023 were filed before this Court against the Respondents named therein in each petition,

under and in terms of Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter the Constitution), alleging that the failure to hold Local

Authorities Elections 2023 as envisaged by law of this country and postponement of the same

amounts to an infringement or imminent infringement and /or continuing infringement of the

fundamental rights of the respective Petitioners of the said applications guaranteed to them

under the Constitution.

As all the above matters revolved around the issue of failure to conduct the Local Authorities

Elections, all those matters were taken up together before a specially nominated bench of five

judges and a consolidated hearing took place. This judgment is the result of such consolidated

proceedings.

SC FR 69/2023.

The Petitioner in this application, which was filed on 21.02.2023, is the General Secretary of

the political party named “Samagi Jana Balawegaya”. He is also a Member of Parliament

application, the matters impugned before this Court are the decisions and actions of the 1st

Respondent (the Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance) and of the 2nd Respondent

(Honourable Minister of Defence, Finance, Economic Stabilisation, National Policies,

Technology, Investment Promotion, Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment who is

also H.E the President of the Republic represented in these proceedings by the Honourable

Attorney General in terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution) to not provide adequate funds,

for the purpose of conducting Local Authorities Elections, to the Election Commission, of

which the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents who were the Chairman and Members during the

relevant period. The Petitioner in SC FR 69/2023 alleges said actions and decisions of the

Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance and the Minister of Finance are arbitrary,

wrongful, illegal, malicious, capricious, pernicious and unlawful. Petitioner in application No.

Petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 12(1), 14(1)(a) and their right

to exercise franchise guaranteed by Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution have been infringed

and consequential reliefs, the Petitioner has focussed his application mainly on the alleged

infringing acts and decisions of the Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance and the

Minister of Finance which caused the non-provision of adequate funds to hold the Local

Government polls. Along with his application, the Petitioner has tendered documents marked

P1 to P10 in support of his application. This Court, on 03.03.2023, granted leave to proceed

filed by the 1st and 8th Respondents. The 4th Respondent, the Chairman of the Election

Commission has filed his affidavit dated 22.05.2023 along with documents marked 4R1 to

polls. The Petitioner has filed his counter objections by way of an affidavit dated 27.07.2023

along with documents marked C1 and C2.

SC FR 139/2023

The Petitioners in this application, which was filed on 15.05.2023, are the ‘People’s Action for

Free and Fair Elections (PAFFERAL), the 1st Petitioner and its Executive Director, the 2nd

Petitioner. This application also centers around the alleged infringement, continuing

infringement or imminent infringement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles

10,12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution due to the relevant decisions, actions and Cabinet

Memoranda and related letters which hinder the conduct of Local Authorities Election 2023 as

the relevant authorities failed in providing sufficient funds. Thus, the Petitioners has prayed for

declaratory reliefs with regard to the said infringement, continuing infringements or imminent

infringements and consequential reliefs that will make the conducting of the said election

possible. Along with the Petition the Petitioners have tendered documents marked P1 to P25 in

support of their application. The Petitioners have made Honorable Attorney General the 1st

Respondent in dual capacity firstly as required by law in fundamental rights applications and

secondly in terms of Articles 35(1) and 35(3) to represent the H.E. the President of Sri Lanka

who is also the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies. The 2nd

Respondent is the Hon. Prime Minister who is also the Minister of Public Administration,

Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government. The 3rd to 22nd Respondents are the

other members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka while 23rd Respondent is the Secretary

to the Cabinet of Ministers. 24th Respondent is the Secretary to the Treasury as well as the

27

Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. The 25th Respondent is the Secretary to the Ministry of

Public Administration, Home affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government while the 26th

Respondent is the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security. The 27th, 28th and 29th

Respondents are the Government Printer, IGP and Post Master General of Sri Lanka

respectively. The 30th to 34th Respondents are the Chairman of the Election Commission,

members of the Election Commission and the Commissioner General of Elections. The 27th

Respondent, the Government Printer has filed her objections by way of an affidavit dated

29.08.2023 along with the documents marked 27R1 to 27 R11. The 28th Respondent, IGP has

filed his objections by way of an affidavit dated 29.08.2023 along with the documents marked

28R1 to 28R9B. The 24th Respondent, the Secretary to the Treasury has tendered his objections

by way of an affidavit dated 29.08.2023 along with the documents marked 24R1-A, 24R1-B,

X,Y,Z1,Z2,Z3,24R2,24R3,24R4 and their annexures. On behalf of the Petitioners, the 2nd

Petitioner has tendered a counter affidavit dated 25.09.2023. The 33A,33B,33C and 34th

Respondents (present Chairman, present members of the Election Commission and the

Commissioner General of Elections) have filed their affidavit in objections dated 25.09.2023

along with the documents marked 33R-1 to 33R-37.

When looking at the prayers of each Petition, it can be perceived that the Petitioner in SC FR

69/2023 has focused more on the alleged infringements caused by the Secretary to the Treasury

and the Ministry of Finance and H.E. the President as Minister of Finance by not releasing

necessary funds and the alleged infringement caused by the Government Printer by not

tendering postal voting poll cards. In other Petitions, the relevant Petitioners have prayed for

reliefs against all the parties they have named as Respondents. Thus, other than against the

Secretary to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance and / or the Minister of Finance, they

have prayed reliefs against the Chairman and the Members of the Election Commission,

Commissioner General of Elections, Cabinet of Ministers including the Minister in charge of

Local Government Elections, the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers and Secretaries of

relevant Ministries, Government Printer and IGP etc. During the argument most of the

Petitioners focused on the failure to provide funds. Further, the Petitioners in SC FR 90/2023

also stressed on the duties and responsibilities of the Election Commission.

Affidavits filed by the Chairman of the Election Commission at the relevant time or by the

present Chairman and members of the Election Commission and Commissioner General of

Elections in the above applications stress on the fact that denial of funding would create a

dangerous precedent that would impinge on the democratic rights of the people and move for

28

appropriate orders from this Court on the relevant officials to facilitate holding of elections.

Thus, it is clear, though the Election Commission represent a limb of the executive arm of the

State, it does not stand with the position taken up by the Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry

of Finance and the parties who stands with him stating that the holding of elections was

impossible due to the lack of funds. The IGP, the Government Printer and the Director General

of Information have filed objections to indicate that they were not involved in any infringing

act.

With the conclusion of the oral arguments, this Court directed the parties to file written

submissions along with documents they rely on but only few have annexed the documents they

rely on to their final written submissions.

Some important Facts placed before this Court through the above applications

• On or around 10.02.2018, the Local Authorities Elections were held across the country

(except in Elpitiya), and thereafter on 10.02.2018, members were declared as elected to

the Local Authorities (except in Elpitiya) in Sri Lanka.

• Therefore, after the lapse of the 48 months, the terms of the said Local Authorities

(except Elpitiya) expired on or about 08.03.2022.

• In respect of Elpitiya, Local Authority Elections were held on the 11th October 2019,

• Thus, the terms of the Local Authorities (except Elpitiya) were to expire on 19.03.2023,

with no further period of extension available in terms of the law.

29

• As per Section 25 of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance (as amended), elections

shall be held within a period of six months preceding the date on which the term of

office of the members to be elected is due to commence. Thus, the election could have

been declared from or around 21.09.2022 as the terms of the Local Authorities (except

Elpitiya) were to expire on 19.03.2023.

Constitutional and Statutory Duty to hold Local Government Elections

37

Article 103 of the Constitution establishes the Election Commission consisting of five members

who are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. One

member so appointed shall be appointed as the Chairman of the Commission by the President.

In terms of Article 103(2), the object of the Commission shall be to conduct free and fair

elections and Referenda.

In terms of Article 104(B)(1), among other powers, functions and duties of the Commission

relating to other elections, the Commission is also empowered to exercise, perform and

discharge all such powers, duties and functions conferred or imposed on or assigned to -

(a) the Commission; or

(b) the Commissioner-General of Elections,

by the Constitution, and by the law for the time being relating to the election of members of

Local Authorities.

As mentioned above the term of last Local Authorities were due to expire on 08.03.2022 but it

was extended in terms of the relevant statutes by the then Minister of Local Government by a

period of 12 months until 19.03.2023. In term of Section 24 of the Local Authorities Election

Ordinance, every election of the members of a Local Authority shall be held in the manner

provided by the said Ordinance.

In term of Section 25 of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance, every general election of

the members of a local authority shall be held within a period of six months preceding the date

on which the term of office of the members who are to be elected is due to commence. As per

Section 26 of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance the returning officer of the district is

required to publish a notice of intention to hold such election. After receiving nominations, if

there is a contest between different political parties or independent groups as contemplated by

Section 37 of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance, with the receipt of the report under

aforesaid Section 37, the relevant district returning officer has to publish a notice in Gazette

under Section 38 of the said Ordinance specifying several factors including the date of the poll.

Thus, the process for Local Government Election is triggered by the law itself when the term

of the existing Local Authority reaches its final six months.

Thus, it is clear that in terms of the aforesaid provisions of the Constitution and the Local

Authorities Elections Ordinance, the Election Commission was duty bound to hold the

38

Local Authorities election before the expiry of the term of Local Authorities on 19.03.2023

in accordance with the provisions in the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.

In terms of Article 33(c) of the Constitution, in addition to the powers and functions expressly

conferred on or assigned to H.E. the President by the Constitution or by any written law, the

President of the Republic shall have the power to ensure the creation of proper conditions for

the conduct of free and fair elections, at the request of the Election Commission.

Thus, the Head of the Executive, H.E. the President of the Republic is also subject to the

constitutional duty to exercise the power under and in terms of Article 33(c), to ensure

that all necessary steps are taken in order to conduct free and fair elections at the request

of the election Commission. In the matter at hand, H.E. the President is also the Minister

of Finance.

On the other hand, one can argue that the people of this country have legitimate expectation to

elect members of Local Authorities of their choice1 as per the law when the election becomes

due. The People can also legitimately expect that the money allocated by their representatives

in the Parliament would be used for the purpose it was allocated unless a deviation is needed

only on unavoidable reasonable grounds.

Hence, if the Election Commission is in breach of the aforesaid constitutional and statutory

duty or the legitimate expectations and / or H.E. the President being the Minister of Finance

and head of the Executive relevant to the present applications in issue is in breach of aforesaid

constitutional duty or legitimate expectations without a lawful cause and /or due to an arbitrary

and / or malicious and/or wrongful and / or illegal and/or capricious and/or pernicious act or

decision as alleged, and thereby violated a co-related right/s of the Petitioner or the people,

the said duties or legitimate expectations will be discussed later in this judgment.

Freedom of Expression, Franchise as part of sovereignty and polling at Local

Government Elections

The Petitioners in their Petitions allege that there is an infringement and /or continuing

infringement and / or imminent infringement of fundamentals rights protected in terms of

1 Mohamed Hussain Hajir Muhammad and others v Election Commission of Sri Lanka and Others SC FR No.35/2016 decided on 15.12.2017

39

Article 10, 12(1) and 14 (1)(a) of the Constitution and there is a violation of their right to use

franchise as contemplated by Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution. I have already discussed

above the relevance of Article 12(1) in relation to the legitimate expectations of a voter as well

as in relation to the constitutional and statutory duties. Now, I endeavor to see whether it is

necessary to consider infringements in relation to Articles 10, 14(1)(a) and violation of

franchise in terms of Articles 3 and 4.

In Karunathilaka and Another v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections

and Others (1999) 1 Sri L R 157, the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article

14(1) (a) of the Constitution was broadly construed to include the exercise of the right of an

elector to vote at the election (at page 173 and 174).

Per Fernando, J.

“The silent and secret expression of a citizen's preference between one candidate and another

by casting his vote is no less an exercise of the freedom of speech and expression than the most

eloquent speech from a political platform.” (at page 174)

In Mediwake and Others v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and

Others (2001) 1Sri L R 177 it was held inter alia that:

"It is not disputed that the Petitioners, being registered voters of the Kandy District, had a

legal right to vote at that election, and that voting, in the exercise of that legal right, was a

form of "expression" guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a), as I held in Karunatileke v. Dissanayake.”

(at page 209)

The aforementioned view was further confirmed in Thavneethan v Dayanada Dissanayake

Commissioner of Elections and Others (2003) 1Sri L R 74.

Even the Respondents for whom the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) appears do

not contest that the right to vote at a Local Government Election would be part of the freedom

of expression guaranteed in Article 14(1) (a) of the Constitution.

Above clearly indicates that voting in elections falls within the scope of freedom of expression

as contemplated in Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. Thus, denial of a free and fair Local

Government Election within the period it should have been held can be considered within the

scope of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution.

40

The word franchise among other meanings generally means the right to vote in elections. This

may in the context of the constitutional provisions include a person’s right to present himself

as a candidate in an election. The Petitioners in these applications contend that the alleged

failure to hold Local Government Polls 2023 as contemplated by law was violative of the right

of franchise enshrined in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution. Thus, it is required to see whether

this Court need to inquire into the allegations that the alleged acts of the Respondents are

violative of franchise as encapsulated in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution, in these

applications filed in terms of Article 17 and 126 of the Constitution. Article 3 reads as follows;

“In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty

includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and franchise.”

The term “franchise” seems to have been used in Article 3 without any limitation to its general

meaning. However, Article 4 of the Constitution among others with regard to franchise

provides that;

“The Sovereignty of the People shall be exercised and enjoyed in the following manner: -

(a)….

(b) …….

(c)……

(d)…..

(e) the franchise shall be exercisable at the election of the President of the Republic and of the

Members of Parliament, and at every Referendum by every citizen who has attained the age of

eighteen years, and who, being qualified to be an elector has hereinafter provided, has his

name entered in the register of electors.”

As seen above, the Local Government Elections have not been included in Article 4(e) as an

occasion where franchise can be exercisable. As indicated by the learned ASG even Article 88

of the Constitution which refers to persons who have the right to be an elector states that 'Every

person shall, unless disqualified as hereinafter provided, be qualified to be an elector at the

election of the President and of the Members of Parliament or to vote at any Referendum:

Provided that no such person shall be entitled to vote unless his name is entered in the

appropriate register of electors'. Here also Local Government Elections are not included.

41

As Local Government bodies such as Municipal Councils, Urban Councils were very much in

existence at the time of promulgation of the 1977 Constitution, the choice to exclude Local

Government bodies from the Article 4(e) seems to be a deliberate act. It was further argued

that ‘Expressio unius est exclusion alterius’ applies and Local Government Elections cannot

be considered as part of franchise and sovereignty as contemplated in Articles 3 and 4. To

support the said view, it can also be asserted, that when the language of a provision is clear and

unambiguous, the Court cannot read words into a provision of the Act in interpreting the same

and when the language is plain the task of interpretation does not arise. The view that franchise

as contemplated in Articles 3 and 4(e) does not include voting in Local Government Elections

is supported by the views expressed in the determinations made by this Court in Pradeshiya

Sabhas (Amendment) (1996) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills(1991-

2003)Volume VII 67], Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill and Local Authorities

Elections (Amendment) Bill (2010) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary

Bills(2010- 2012) Volume X 17], Local Authorities Election (Amendment) Bill (2016)

[Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2016- 2017) XIII 16].

However, one can form a counter argument that the term franchise in Article 3 has a wider

meaning even to include voting in local government elections or any other public election and

exercise of franchise as expressed in Article 4(e) is not exhaustive and to limit it to voting in

Presidential election, Parliamentary election and Referendum the Court has to insert the word

“only” to the said provision which is not the task of the Court. At this juncture, it must be stated

that there are certain decisions that favoured the view that the term franchise in Articles 3 and

4(e) include the voting in other elections such as Local Government Elections. In Local

Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill (2003) [Decisions of the Supreme Courton

Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003), the Court rejected the argument of the learned ASG who

appeared in that case that the franchise in relation to Local Authorities does not come within

the purview of Article 3 as the Constitution has to be looked at as an organic whole and its

terms cannot be fixed to meaning that they may have had at the time of enactment. The Court

also found that the Local Authorities, especially after the 13th Amendment had acquired

constitutional recognition. However, it should be noted that this decision has not considered

the previous decision made in Pradeshiya Sabhas (Amendment) (1996) (Supra).

Furthermore, this decision in Local authorities (Special Provisions) Bill (2003) (Supra) had

been considered in Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill and Local Authorities

Elections (Amendment) Bill (2010) (Supra) and have not been followed as the view expressed

42

in relation to Article 3 appears to have been considered as obiter. Anyhow it appears the

decisions such as Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution Bill SC (SD) No.20/2017 to

SC (SD) 32/2017, Wijesekara v Attorney General (2007) 1Sri L R 38, Mohamed Hussain

Hajiar and Others v Election Commissioner of Sri Lanka and Others SC FR Application

35/2016, SC minutes 15.12.2017, appears to be decisions that considered Provincial Council

elections and Local Authority Elections as elections that fall within the purview of franchise

contemplated in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution.

The learned ASG, referring to the decision in 13th Amendment to the Constitution Bill

(1987) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1987) Volume III 19], and

Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution Bill (2018) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on

Parliamentary Bills (2018) Volume XIV 67] strenuously argues that if franchise contemplated

in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution is extended to include other elections such as Provincial

Council elections and Local Authority Elections, those Provincial Councils and Local

Authorities become sovereign bodies and cannot be abolished by the central authority, namely

the President and the Parliament, and as such, such extension is repugnant to Article 2 of the

Constitution which declares the Republic as a Unitary State. I must admit there is substance in

this argument as I observe that the exercise of sovereignty in relation to powers of government

as reflected in Article 4(a)(b) and (c) is co-related to the exercise of franchise referred to in

Article 4(e).

In my view all these aspects need not be considered and decided in these applications filed in

terms of Articles 17 and 126.These are not applications to determine whether a Bill should be

passed by a special majority or by a referendum or what is included in the right to exercise

franchise. These applications filed before this Court have been filed under Article 17 and 126

praying for relief for the infringement of fundamental rights. It is true that sovereignty includes

fundamental rights. No provision in Chapter III of the Constitution directly states that violation

of right to franchise is a violation of a fundamental right. Whether there is a breach of right to

franchise as contemplated in Articles 3 and 4 or not, this Court has to consider the violation in

terms of fundamental rights as guaranteed in terms of Chapter III of the Constitution. Even if

there is a violation of right to franchise what should be decided is whether such violation falls

within the provisions found within Chapter III of the Constitution such as provision for equal

protection and freedom of expression. The Petitioners have pleaded that denial of their right

to vote or to contest in the Local Government polls 2023 falls within Articles 12(1), 14(1)(a)

and 10 of the said Chapter. Thus, in my view it is not necessary to find whether the alleged

43

facts violate the franchise as contemplated in Articles 3 and 4. What is necessary is to

adjudicate whether there is a violation or imminent violation of fundamental rights guaranteed

under the said Chapter III of the Constitution.

However, some Petitioners also pray for a declaration in terms of Article 10 of the Constitution,

which states that ‘Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,

including the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of his choice.’ This Article relates

to a person’s freedom of thought, conscience, religion or beliefs and his freedom to have or

adopt such belief according to his own choice. The denial of one’s right to vote at an election

or his right to stand as a candidate is difficult to be considered as denial of his thoughts,

conscience or belief or his choice, but only as a denial of the expression of his thoughts,

conscience or belief or choice. Irrespective of the fact whether the election is held or not his

thoughts, conscience, beliefs or choice will remain. Thus, in relating to the facts revealed in

these applications, I see no reason to consider a violation under Article 10 of the Constitution.

For the reasons discussed above, these applications will be considered to see whether there is

any infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the

Constitution by one or many of the Respondents named in the Petitions owing to the failure to

hold the Local Government Election 2023.

Analysis as to the alleged violation of Fundamental Rights under Article 12(1) and

14(1)(a)

The Election Commission, which consists of five members appointed by H.E. the President on

the recommendation of the Constitutional Council, and one among them is appointed as the

Chairman by the President, is established in accordance with the provisions of Article 103 of

the Constitution. In terms of Article 104, the quorum for any meeting shall be three members

and the Chairman has to preside at the meetings but in his absence the members present have

to elect a member to preside. The decisions of the Commission shall be by a majority of the

members present and voting at the meeting at which the decision is taken, and in the event of

equality of votes, the Chairman or the member presiding at the meeting shall have a casting

vote.

It appears that the learned ASG’s attempt was to convince the Court that for a meeting to be

valid, the members must physically meet at one place and for every decision whether there is

a division of views or not a vote must be taken and recorded. Furthermore, the learned ASG

referring to other similar and parallel provisions relating to other constitutional bodies such as

44

National Police Commission, National Procurement Commission, Public Service Commission,

Judicial Service Commission and Constitutional Council etc. states that the Election

Commission has to take decisions strictly in terms of Article 104(2)(b) and no deviation can be

permitted. In the modern world, meetings can be conducted using technology and participants

need not physically meet at one place. The terms in the Constitution shall not be fixed to a

meaning that may have had at the time of enactment. If not, it may deny the benefit of efficiency

with the ongoing development in other spheres. What is necessary is a meeting with a quorum

to take decisions. On the other hand, voting arises only when there is a contest or difference of

views or opinions. If the decisions are unanimous, I do not see any need for a vote and recording

the results of the vote, other than the recording of the unanimous decision. The Constitutional

provisions with regard to decision making is not to make the procedure cumbersome and

inefficient but to make the decisions transparent and sound. On the other hand, all official acts

can be presumed to have been done properly. Hence, in my view, if the decisions are

unanimous, not taking a vote or not maintaining a record as to the result of vote relating to such

decisions are not acts in breach of the provisions in Article 104(2)(b). On the other hand, it is

questionable whether the Respondents for whom the learned ASG appears have pleaded the

above grounds in their objections. It is true that in the objections filed in SC FR 69/2023, among

other things the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance in reply to the averments in paragraphs

4,5,6 and 7 of the Petition in that application, has averred that the 4 to 7th Respondents (then

members of the Election Commission sans Mrs. P S M Charles) alone are not mandated or

vested with power under the law to make the decisions that they claimed to have made, and

such decisions are bad and invalid in law without having constitutional sanctity as they do not

appear to have been made by the Election Commission, and further that such decisions have

not been shown to be quorate decisions- vide paragraph 12 of the affidavit dated 22.06.2023 in

SC FR 69/2023. In fact, what has been marked through those paragraphs of the Petition in that

application are the documents marked P2, P3, P4 and P5, namely the Gazette notifications in

Gazette No.2311/26 dated 21.12.2022 mentioned above (Gazette notifying the appointment of

returning officers and the assistant returning officers), Gazette notification No.2312/44 dated

29.12.2022 mentioned above (Gazette notifying the relevant number of candidates for each

Local Authority and the amounts of deposits) and two notices issued by the Commissioner

General of Elections on the direction of Election Commission announcing that notices calling

for nominations for Local Authorities Election 2023 for 340 Local Government Authorities

(excluding Elpitiya) were being displayed, and nominations would be accepted between

18.01.2023 to 21.01.2023 and election deposits would be accepted until 12 noon 20th January

45

2023 (these notices have also been marked as P5with the Petition in SC FR 79/2023 and as P4

and P5 with the Petition in SC FR 90/2023). Hence, it appears that the said challenge is made

to the decision to appoint returning officers and assistant returning officers and to the decision

to issue notices in terms of the Local Government Elections Ordinance, as amended. Those

tasks were tasks that were entrusted to the then Commissioner of Elections and now appears to

be the tasks of the Election Commission, as in terms of Article 104B. It is the duty of the

Election Commission to conduct Local Government Elections. Article 104F of the Constitution

now directly confers on the Commission the power to appoint returning officers and assistant

returning officers.

Before I delve into the issue whether there was a quorate decision to do the publications of

aforesaid notices in gazettes, it is worthwhile to mention the affidavit of Mrs. P.S.M Charles

dated 20.11.2023, who was a member of the Commission from about November 2022 to 26th

January 2023, filed in SC FR 90/2023. There she avers as follows;

“I state that I have not participate at any meeting of the Elections Commission of Sri Lanka

wherein the members of the Commission resolved to call for nominations to hold elections in

terms of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (as amended) during the year 2022 or 2023

or take any step with regard to specifying the dates and times of accepting deposits and /or

nominations in respect of an election held in terms of the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance (as amended).

I further states that I verily believe that if any such decision had been taken by members of the

Elections Commission such decision could not have been taken at a duly convened and

constituted meeting with a proper quorum.”

In reply to the above affidavit, the Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake

has filed an affidavit dated 04.12.2023 along with documents marked 11R1 to 11R33. 11R1 to

11R 11 are the attendance sheets of the 61st to 71st meetings of the said Commission held on

15.11.2022, 28.11.2022, 08.12.2022, 20.12.2022, 23.12.2022, 29.12.2022, 03.01.2023,

09.01.2023, 11.01.2023, 13.01.2023 and 18.01.2023 respectively. The aforesaid member P S

M Charles, have not attended the meetings held on 23.12.2022, 29.12.2022, and 13.01.2023.

However, on all days mentioned above at least four members have participated and as such any

decision made on those meetings are quorate decisions. 11R 13 to 11R 24 are the minutes of

the meetings held on those days mentioned above and those have been tendered along with

some commission papers (some of them bears a date prior to the meeting date), which appears

46

to have submitted for approval during the said meetings. Some hand written endorsements on

those commission papers indicate that, even though those commission papers bear a different

date, the decisions relating to them were taken on the date of the meeting. Thus, all the decisions

found in those minutes are quorate decisions and among them are the decisions to appoint

returning officers and assistant returning officers and the decisions relating to publication of

aforesaid notices – vide 11R 13 which contains the decision ECP/22/61 (6), Commission Paper

dated 14.11.2022 bearing said No. ECP /22/61(6) which seeks the approval, Commission Paper

No. ECP/64/10 dated 19.12.22 and decision taken on that in 11R 16 on 20.12.2022. It must be

noted that said P S M Charles has attended those two meetings -vide 11R1, 11R4. It appears

that P S M Charles has deliberately misrepresented facts to this Court through her affidavit.

Moreover, as per Article 104A, subject to the fundamental rights jurisdiction under Article 126,

writ jurisdiction under Article 104H and jurisdiction over any Presidential Election Petition

and Referendum Petition under Article 130 given to the Supreme Court and jurisdiction over

election petitions given to the Court of Appeal under Article 144, decisions and directions of

the Election Commission have been made final and conclusive and no court is empowered to

question such decisions. Making such decisions and directions subject to the writ and

fundamental rights jurisdiction the Constitution itself has recognized them as administrative or

executive decisions and directions. What is more important is that, even though, the learned

ASG challenges the validity of the Decisions of the Election Commission as aforesaid, there is

no material before us to show that any writ application has been filed to quash such decisions

under Article 130 of the Constitution. As these are fundamental rights application, if there is

any allegation that any decision of the Election Commission is violative of fundamental rights,

Court may have jurisdiction in terms of Article 126 to invalidate such decisions or to make

remedial measures if this Court finds such violations. However, there is no such application

before us alleging that such decisions or directions of the Election Commission have violated

the fundamental rights of anyone. Now what the learned ASG had endeavored in this

application was to get relief that he could have prayed in a writ application without filing such

application in terms of Article 130.

The learned ASG challenges in his submissions the credibility of the members of Election

Commission as they have not produced the necessary material to show that their decisions were

legally valid at the outset with their objections. I do not see any necessity to do that as they

were only respondents who were responding to the Petitioners’ applications which did not

challenge the validity of the decisions and directions of the Elections Commissions.

47

For the reasons given above, this Court cannot accept the arguments of the learned ASG that

challenged the validity of the decisions or directions of the Election Commission on the basis

that those decisions or directions were not made in accordance with Article 104.

The learned ASG also argues that the Election Commission was unreasonable in its decision

making, thus departed from the principles of reasonableness in the conduct of its administrative

and constitutional functionality. As per the objections filed Secretary, Ministry of Finance, this

position appears to have been taken up in the objections owing to the following grounds;

• Lack of coordination with the relevant stake holders in advance; In this regard it is

stated in the objections that Section 25 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

requires the general election of the members of a Local Authority to be held within a

period of six months preceding the date on which the term of office of the members, who

are to be elected, is due to commence and the said period of six months commenced on

or around 20.09.2022. Since Local Authorities Elections is a process that requires

advance preparation as it involves the largest number of candidates, and it is necessary to

consult and coordinate with relevant stakeholders in advance in the exercise of the duties,

powers and functions of the Election Commission, which would only constitute as

reasonable conduct by a constitutional functionality tasked with the holding of a nation-

wide election.

• Belated communication of the holding of Local Government Election to the

Secretary, Ministry of Finance; In this regard he highlights that he did not receive any

communication from the Elections Commission regarding the Local Authorities

Elections from or around 20.09.2022 until he received a letter dated 09th January 2023

from the Chief Accountant on behalf of the 3rd Respondent.

• The Election Commission should have considered that the economy of the Country

was in dire straits; In this regard he has stated that the said state of affairs was in the

public domain and was known by the general public at large. To support this view, he has

marked a report on issues in managing government cash flow amidst the ongoing serious

economic crisis marked 1R1 prepared by him.

48

• Not adverting the attention of the national treasury to prioritized budgetary

allocations in time; In this regard it is stated that the Election Commission did not advert

the attention of the national treasury to the need to have prioritized a budgetary allocation

for a national election, as opposed to a budgetary estimate, in the course of the budget

deliberations that were in process between September - November 2022. It is again stated

that even though the process for the Local Authorities Elections could have commenced

on or around 20.09.2022, the Secretary to the Finance Ministry received a communication

for the first time only from the Chief Accountant on 09.01.2023 setting out some expenses

associated with the Local Authorities Election and requesting an imprest, which was

followed by another communication dated 10.11.2023, requesting to attend a meeting on

11.01.2023 to discuss ‘Management of Election Expenses’ with the Finance Ministry.(

the said communications have been marked as 1R2 and 1R2A)

• Failure of the Election Commission to consider what was explained in the meeting

held on 11.01.2023; In this regard the Secretary, Finance Ministry states that a senior

officials of the Treasury attended the aforesaid meeting on 11.01.2023 with the Election

Commission and explained to the Election Commission the serious challenges and

difficulties faced by the Treasury in view of the depleted budgetary position on account

of country's poor economic and fiscal performance over the preceding few years and

alleges that the Election Commission did not appear to have taken a decision pursuant to

such representations. In support of this stance, he has brought this Court’s attention to the

documents marked by the Chairman of the Election Commission as 4R8, 4R11, and

4R12, which are the letters addressed to the Chairman of the Election Commission by the

Governor of Central Bank, Chairman of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Chairman of

the Electricity Board respectively, which reflects the economic crisis the country was

facing during the relevant time and report prepared by him marked IR3 and its annexures

marked A to H.

On the above grounds, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance has stated that there is a clear

departure from the principle of reasonableness in the conduct of an administrative and

constitutional functionality such as the Election Commission.

However, when there is a statutory and constitutional duty to hold Local Government Elections,

when the relevant authority taking steps to hold the said election one cannot say that it is

unreasonable. On the other hand, when allocation of money has been made through the budget,

49

the members of the Election Commission could have legitimately expected that the money

would be released and therefore they cannot be blamed for commencing the process and

endeavoring to continue it for which they are statutorily bound. It is the Secretary to the Ministry

of Finance and Treasury who manned the treasury who should foresee in advance the difficulties

in releasing money under various imprests and take necessary precautions and take steps to set

priorities in advance according to law as to the expenditure on the available funds with the

approval of the relevant authority which is responsible to manage the public finance allocated

by the Budget. It appears the budgetary allocation was done very close to the requests for funds

made by the Election Commission.

Other than some directions that was issued through circulars to control expenditure there was

no indication that there would be a discontinuation of releasing funds for the intended tasks as

per the budgetary allocation. Through Cabinet Decisions, such prioritization was given to

certain areas of expenditure only after the election process started. In such a situation it cannot

be said that the commencement of said election process was unreasonable as the Commission

was doing its statutory duty. In fact, it is seen that the Secretary to the Treasury has released

certain amount of money to the Election Commission, Government Printer and the Police

Department – vide paragraph 7(t) of his own Affidavit. Now there is an attempt to say that to

settle the commitment already made those money had to be released and furthermore, that there

was a possibility that Election Commission could have issued a direction which may result in a

criminal liability if that money was not released. If there were no funds to hold an election and

if it was an impossibility, it could have been clear ground to consider as the law does not expect

to do the impossible. As the treasury is involved in preparation of budget, officers of the treasury

should have an idea when these money may be asked for the allocated purposes. In such a

situation, it is the treasury that should have conveyed to the Election Commission with regard

to the non-availability of funds before the due time arrived to commence its statutory duty.

Election Commission cannot foresee how the treasury act in relation to the allocated funds. If

there was no money to complete the election process, money is wasted if only a part of the

allocation was released and thereafter the releasing the balance needed for the intended task is

stopped. If there were no funds, it is the treasury that would have been more vigilant to take

precautions beforehand than blaming the Election Commission. Thus, the treasury was not

vigilant enough to see the danger in spending the funds allocated as per the budget would cause

immense hardship to the economy and take necessary steps beforehand prior to the relevant

50

event occurred or commenced. It now tries to blame the Election Commission for commencing

to take steps to do its statutory duty as unreasonable. That cannot be accepted.

Furthermore, the learned ASG has relied on many other new grounds in his lengthy written

submissions that were not stated in the objections such as not considering the delimitation

process, effect of on-going election law reforms etc. to say that the Election Commission was

not reasonable. Even the Counsel appearing for the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public

Administration and Local Government also has filed written submissions referring to this

delimitation process and law reforms but without filing any objections. Moreover, while

asserting that matters should be looked into as at the time of litis contestatio was reached, i.e. at

the time of the closure of pleadings, the learned ASG has endeavored to convince this Court that

the Election Commission / its members and/or officials have acted ultra vires in their

communications with the Secretary Treasury, Government Printer, IGP and other authorities as

well as that the Election Commission acted ultra vires the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

which have not been raised through objections filed on behalf of the parties he appears, for other

parties to respond. However, it is my view that it is not proper to decide these applications on

matters which were not properly placed before this Court through their pleadings as the opposite

party could not have placed their case in response. Therefore, I do not intend to decide on those

new grounds made during submissions which are not based on the objections filed.

Whether such grounds were averred in the objections or not, as said before, decisions, directions

and acts of the Election Commission have a final and conclusive effect and its members and

officers have an immunity from being challenged in Courts for their acts done in good faith

subject to the fundamental rights jurisdiction, writ jurisdiction and jurisdiction over Presidential

Elections and Referendum given to this Court and Election Petition jurisdiction given to the

Court of Appeal subject to an appeal to this Court. No material has been placed before this Court

to show that any writ application has been filed challenging such decisions, directions or

regarding any communication etc. These are fundamental rights applications and no one has

challenged those so called unreasonable or ultra vires acts, decisions or directions or

communications have infringed any fundamental rights. If there were such applications claiming

those as violative of fundamental rights, this Court may have jurisdiction in terms of Article 126

to invalidate such decisions or to make remedial measures if this Court finds such violations.

However, there is no such application before us alleging that such decisions or directions, acts

or communications of the Election Commission or its officers have violated fundamental rights

of anyone. As stated above the learned ASG cannot be allowed to challenge the decisions,

51

directions, acts or communications of the Election Commission in this manner. As those

decisions, directions, acts or communications have not been challenged in terms of the

Constitution, they are final and conclusive.

At this juncture, it is necessary to refer to the Article 104(B)(2) of the Constitution which reads

as follows;

“It shall be the duty of the Commission to secure the enforcement of all laws relating to the

holding of any such election or the conduct of Referenda and it shall be the duty of all authorities

of the State charged with enforcement of such laws, to co-operate with the Commission to secure

such enforcement”

Above makes it clear that every authority of the State charged with enforcement of any law

relating to the holding of any election has to co-operate with the Election Commission to secure

such enforcement. Thus, in my view, the other limbs of the executive arm of the government

have to cooperate with the Election Commission in conducting the election once the process

commenced. If the Secretary, Ministry of Finance observed defects, irregularities in acts,

communications, decisions and directions of the Commission or its officers, is it not his duty to

act in co-operation and place it before the Commission in writing and get errors rectified (if any)

to get things going for a successful completion to protect voting rights of the people? I cannot

consider that keeping such errors (if any) in secret as a reason for not providing funds and taking

up it in defense at the last stage of proceedings before this Court as cooperation. On the other

hand, after bringing it to the notice of the Election Commission, if there was no favourable

response to correct any error (if any) the Secretary, Ministry of Finance could have sought legal

remedy through a writ application. Administrative Law by H.R.W. Wade & C.F.

Forsyth,11th Edition at page 520 states that “Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally

granted on the application of a private litigant, though it may equally well be used by one public

authority against another.” In this regard, the Learned P.C who appeared for the Election

Commission has brought this Court’s attention to the Colombo Port City Economic

Commission Bill Determination SC SD Nos 04/2021,05/2021, 07/2021 to 23/2021 which held

that “even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes

the illegality must be established before a court. As stated by Wade and Forsyth, Administrative

Law, 9th Ed. Indian Edition, page 281 ……the Court will treat an administrative act or order

invalid only if the right remedy is sought by the right person in the right proceedings.”

52

As pointed out earlier, H.E. the President is the Minister of Finance, and when the requests are

placed through the Secretary, it can be argued that he too has a duty as the President to ensure

the creation of proper conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections. On the other hand,

as said before, aforesaid positions taken up by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance somewhat

taints the genuineness of the stance taken in defense that there was an impossibility due to lack

of funds.

The learned ASG has taken up the position that the application No. FR139/2023 is time barred.

However, prayer G, H and I in the Petition pray for a declaration with regard to continuing

violation. As far as the right to vote is delayed, there will be a continuing violation till it is

exercised. Thus, the application cannot be considered as time barred.

It appears that some Petitioners (vide written submissions in SC FR 69/2023) allege that the

IGP and Government Printer acted in a manner to prevent the election being held. In this regard,

it is brought to the notice of Court that the estimate expenditure presented by the Police

Department was many folds greater than the amount spent by the same Department at the

elections held in the year 2020. It is also said that the Government Printer required Rs. 400Mn

and demanded upfront payment for printing ballot papers and other material when the previous

practice was to do it on credit basis and the treasury to pay after the printing was completed. It

is also said that the Government Printer refused to print ballot papers till the necessary security

is provided by the police. However, the mere escalation in the estimates cannot be considered

as a step taken to prevent the election. It depends on the economic situation of the country and

inflation existed at that time might have caused the escalation in the estimates. Even the

Government Printer asking for security or upfront payment per se cannot be considered as an

act of sabotaging the election as she is subject to the circulars such as circular No.02/2023

marked 3R4C in SC FR 90/2023 issued by the superior officer, the Secretary to the Ministry of

Finance and Secretary to the Treasury. In fact, in 3R10B filed in the same brief, she has revealed

the difficulty her department faced with paying salaries and allowances. In her affidavit dated

19.05.2023 filed in SC FR 79/2023 at paragraphs 19 (l) and (m) she had averred about this

difficulty and how, if the necessary finances were not forthcoming, it could have affected the

limited financial resources of her department. This is where I observe that the Election

Commission was also at a failure in planning and exercising its powers. As per Article 104 B

the Commission shall exercise perform and discharge all such powers, duties and functions

conferred or imposed or assigned to the Commission or Commissioner General by the

Constitution and by law relating to the elections. In terms of Article 104(B)(2), It shall be the

53

duty of the Commission to secure the enforcement of all laws relating to the holding of elections

and it shall be the duty of all state authorities to cooperate with the Commission. Article 104GG

make the refusal to cooperate and / or failure to comply with direction of the Commission

punishable. To secure a free and fair election and enforcement laws relating to such election,

there should be money for the necessary expenditure, ballot papers and protection for the

printing of ballot papers and conduct of the elections I do not think the task of the Commission

is to be a mere intermediary between the treasury and any department when such department

tender an estimate to pass it to the treasury. To secure the enforcement of laws relating to holding

of elections proper management of funds also is necessary. Otherwise, departments assisting the

holding of elections may be able to tender exorbitant estimates which would in the long run in

a poor economy sabotage the holding of elections. Thus, it is necessary for the Election

Commission to take necessary steps to assess the estimates tendered by others than complaining

the estimates are high or allowing others to complain that the estimates tendered by such

departments are unprecedently high.

I do not see any bar for the Election Commission to obtain the cooperation of a suitable

department of the government to assess such estimates. However, other than requests made, I

cannot find any directions given by the Election Commission either to any department or the

Secretary to the Treasury. As per the affidavits filed before this Court the Election Commission

or its Chairman moves for necessary orders on various officials including the Secretary to the

Treasury and Ministry of Finance which indicates that the Commission believed that the holding

of election was not an impossibility due to lack of funds but a possible task, but the Commission

failed in issuing necessary directions to the relevant authorities when necessary. It is also

pertinent to note that in terms of Article 104 C, the Commission can notify the IGP of the

facilities and the number of Police officers needed. The IGP shall make such facilities and police

officers available to the Commission. It is the Commission which should deploy the said

facilities and police officers who are responsible to and act under the direction of the

Commission. As per the documents marked 6R10A,6R9B and 6R9A in SC FR 79/2023, it

appears rather than Election Commission deploying the necessary police officers, it has been

left to the relevant department head to ask for police protection first. In the aforementioned

backdrop it is questionable why the Commission did not use its powers to issue directions, if

necessary, to get the required cooperation. Since the Constitution does not give other

departments any power as contained in Article 104B (1) and (2), it should be the responsibility

of the Commission to arrange for protection and financial assistance including what should be

54

done on credit basis after discussing with relevant authorities other than relevant department

heads to seek for such assistance saying that it was the practice on previous occasions. Thus, I

do not see any mischief in asking money from the Election Commission for the expenses.

However, aforesaid facts indicate the failure of the Commission to use it powers.

It appears from the objections that the Commission expected the other Departments to do their

tasks on credit basis to considerable extent as it was done on previous occasions. This itself

shows that the Commission did not plan the process of holding elections with a proper

understanding of the then existing situation of the Country. Not only the reports and documents

filed by some of the Respondents, some documents filed by the Chairman or the members of

the Commission itself indicate that there was an economic crisis in the Country. On the other

hand, it was in the public domain that the Country was bankrupt or at the verge of bankruptcy

which means that the country was unable to pay its debts. Even in Dr. Athulasiri Samarakoon

and Others v Ranil Wickremasinghe, Minister of Finance (SC/FR/195 and 212/2023, SC

Minutes of 14.11.2023) this Court recognized the economic crisis the country was going

through. In such a backdrop, planning to start the process of holding Local Government

Elections expecting other departments to do their service on a credit basis itself show lack of

proper organization of the event by the Commission. It should have foreseen that the funds are

necessary for the successful completion of the election process and should have first made

arrangements to obtain the necessary funds and or credit for necessary tasks than leaving other

department heads to spend money allocated for their departments or take the risk of doing tasks

on credit basis. The conduct of the Election Commission indicate that it did not accept the view

that the holding of election was not an impossibility. If so, it should have issued directions to

the relevant authority to provide necessary funds or to issue guidance to authorize the relevant

departments to execute the necessary tasks on credit basis. If the Commission believed that there

was a lack of sufficient funds as indicated by the communications with the Secretary to the

Treasury and Ministry of Finance, it could have directed the said Secretary to take necessary

steps to secure necessary funds in accordance with the law. If it is a real situation of no funds,

one can say it is a policy decision to be taken by the representatives of the people how to manage

the funds available giving priorities as full control of public finance lies with the Parliament. By

writing to the Hon. Speaker at the end, it appears that the Commission also came to the

conclusion that the solution remains in the Parliament. In the above backdrop, I do not think

that the Election Commission can be absolved fully from liability as it failed to exercise its

strength and powers fully to make the election process a success. However, the main issue

55

revolves around the failure to release the budgetary allocation for the holding of the Local

Government Elections, which will be discussed below in this judgment.

It is pertinent to note that when the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance who was represented

by the learned ASG filed his objections, to decline liability, he has limited his objections, if

summarize, mainly to the following areas, namely;

• Certain decisions of the Election Commission are not lawful and quorate decisions

made in terms of Article 104. I have already dealt with this issue above in this judgment

• Election Commission was unreasonable in its decision making and thus, departed from

the principles of reasonableness in the conduct of its administrative and constitutional

functionality. I have already dealt with this aspect above.

• Depleted budgetary positions and inability to secure and provide funds for local

government elections due to the ongoing serious economic crisis which caused

problems with regard to government cashflow operations resulting the Cabinet to take

decisions to prioritize certain expenses and to issue circulars to limit expenditure to

certain areas identified as essential per those decisions and circulars.

The denial of funds for the holding of an election will naturally set a dangerous precedent which

will impinge on the democratic rights of the people of this country. Thus, it may require to see

whether the way the denial was done is lawful.

That there was an economic crisis in the country at the relevant time is adequately borne out

by the report submitted to this Court by the Secretary, Treasury annexed to the Limited

Objections in SC/FR/ 69/2023 which was made prior to the filing of these applications, and the

circulars issued just prior to or in or around the time the election process commenced – Also

see IR3 and annexures annexed to the Objections in SC/FR/ 69/2023. Further the said serious

economic crisis has been recognized by this Court in the economic crisis case, namely Dr.

Athulasiri Samarakoon and Others v Ranil Wickremasinghe, Minister of Finance

(Supra) which acknowledged the dire state in which the economy was in as follows;

“We observe that no adequate steps had been taken to remedy the adverse repercussions on

the deficit due to loss of revenue following the tax revisions, in a timely manner even when it

was apparent that the changes failed to bring the expected positive outcomes.

56

Such failure heavily contributed and had a domino effect on the economy which ultimately

collapsed bringing serious hardship to the entire society” – (page 76)

“It is common grounds that the country's economy deteriorated not overnight but over a period

of time under consideration in the matters before us. It was evident from the material placed

before us that the Gross Official Reserves and the Reserves of the Central Bank were depleted

and had reached unprecedented low levels, creating a situation of which the effects were

devastating on the entire citizenry without exception. The severe hardships the people had to

suffer due to scarcities in essentials such as fuel, gas and medicines coupled with long hours

of power shortages brought the lives of people to a standstill and the suffering the public had

to undergo was undoubtedly immeasurable.”- (page 116)

However, one can argue that the people of this Country were experiencing the economic crisis

and the knowledge of existence of it was within the public domain.

On the other hand, even if this depletion of government funds made it difficult to provide funds

for the Local Government Election, it is not a fault of the Petitioners or the people of this

country. Perhaps, it may not be the present Respondents who are directly and personally

responsible for such depletion but understandably such deterioration of the economy has to be

a result of mismanagement of the economy of the country by the persons who held the office

of some of the Respondents. In that backdrop, can the State deny its liability for the violation

of rights for denying the right to vote at the Local Government Election 2023 within the time

period it should have been held? In my view the answer has to be in the negative.

Now I will endeavor to consider the violations of fundamental rights (if any) through the

impugned conduct of one or more of the Respondents.

The Local Government Elections process could not be proceeded with after the two cabinet

decisions, discussed herein before, to give priority to certain expenditure listed and included in

them. One of the aforesaid two decisions that even directed that even any surplus of government

income should be used in accordance with the priorities mentioned therein.

The learned ASG, while referring to the dire economic situation faced by the country and the

decision of this Court in economic crisis case (supra), directive principles of state policy and

fundamental duties, attempted in his written submissions to indicate that the parties he

represents were duty bound to discharge in the manner spelt out in the directive principles in

our Constitution to take every measure to avoid an aggravation of the situation to the detriment

57

of the people. While referring to the said decision of the “economic crisis case”, the learned

ASG especially referred to page 116 which reads as follows;

“In deciding this issue, we are of the view that the respondents ought to have known the factual

situation that prevailed when they assumed public office and they should have fashioned their

acts and efforts to ensure that the situation is not further aggravated but resolved. On

assumption of public office, it was their duty to ensure that the existing issues were addressed

and resolved in the best interest of the country and take every possible measure to avoid an

aggravation to the detriment of the people.”

This appears to have been cited to indicate the said Cabinet Decisions and control of

government expenditure were taken to ensure that the existing issues were addressed and

solved in the best interest of the country and to take every possible measure to avoid an

aggravation to the detriment of the people. However, as stated in the said quoted passage, the

relevant Respondents in this case also ought to have known the factual situation that prevailed

in the country when they also assumed public office. Should not have they fashioned their acts

accordingly even when preparing the budget. Now taking this stance only after few weeks from

the budget not to go ahead as per the allocations made in the budget is questionable making it

to raise concern whether timing of picking these priorities just a few weeks after the budget

and passage of the Appropriation Act, is arbitrary and for some other purpose.

The learned ASG attempted to convince this Court, even though the situation of the economy

was improving, full economic recovery was not yet assured and the Respondents he represented

had to take every possible measure to avoid an aggravation to the detriment of people and they

were responsibly and consciously taking decisions to ensure that the situation did not worsen.

While referring to the Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 27(2), highlighting the

objectives in 27(2) (c), (e), (f) and (h) and the Svasti of the Constitution , the learned ASG

argues that, even though the representative democracy is important, the dignity and well-being

of the People is the ultimate goal to be achieved, and there is a paramount obligation placed on

the State to ensure such dignity and well-being where such dignity and well-being is challenged

in a time of scarce resources. He further argues that even though the Directive Principles are

not justiciable, that this Court in the exercise of its fundamental rights jurisdiction have held

that there is a mandatory duty on the State to act in accordance with the Directive Principles in

the performance of their functions. In this regard he has brought this Court’s attention to

Ravindra Gunawardena Kariyawasam v Central Environment Authority and Others

58

(SC/FR/141/2015, SC Minutes of 04.04.2019 where Prasanna Jayawardena J. at pg. 50 held

“The Directive Principles of State Policy are not wasted ink in the pages of the Constitution.

They are a living set of guidelines which the State and its agencies should give effect to”

Thus, the learned ASG contended that as mandated by Article 27(1) of the Constitution, in the

process of governing the State the Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers are

duty bound to ensure that the people have an adequate standard of living, the equitable

distribution among all citizens of material resources, decentralization of the means of

production, distribution and exchange and the right to universal and equal access to education.

He further contended that measures which have been put in place to meet these objectives such

as social security schemes, free healthcare and free education are invariably costly and thus a

great portion of government revenue must be set aside to fund these services.

However, it must be noted that among the objectives that the State is pledge to establish, the

full realization of fundamental rights and freedom of all persons is included- vide Article

27(2)(a). Further, Article 27(4) cast a duty on the State to strengthen and broaden the

democratic structure of government and the democratic rights of the people by decentralizing

the administration and by affording all possible opportunities to the people to participate at

every level in national life in government. Slave, or a vassal or a serf in a feudal system, might

have had his basic essential needs fulfilled, in contrast the dignity of people in a democratic

society, with its pros and cons, highly rest on their ability to partake in governance whether it

is central, provincial or local, through voting in an election. Thus, actions and restrictions

placing the Local Government Election in the second or lower tier in the guise of protecting

dignity of people of the country is questionable.

In the above backdrop, referring to Paragraph 7p of the affidavit of the Secretary to the Treasury

filed in SC FR69/2023, filed on 23.06.2023, the learned ASG states that the government

identified certain priorities with regard to the Government expenditure as follows;

• The first priority is the debt service payments, including capital repayment and interest

payments which is considered as a mandatory cash flow item.

• The second priority is given to the payment of salaries, pensions and social security

expenses, including Samurdhi payments, as well as payments for the elderly and

differently-abled soldiers, which collectively accounted for about 28% of the total

expenditure and 81% of the recurrent expenditure in 2022.

59

• The third priority is to provide maximum possible funds for medical supplies including

those for life-threating health conditions; to provide for day-to-day essential health

needs; and, outstanding fertilizer bills to ensure food security.

• As the fourth priority, the General Treasury makes every effort to provide at least the

minimum requirement for the payment of utility bills (electricity, water, fuel etc.) and

other recurrent expenses, which include rent and salaries of Sri Lankan missions

abroad, allowances for teachers for exam paper markings, printing of text books and

similar expenses.

The Secretary to the Treasury has further averred that given the serious pressures on the

cashflow and the related limitations, providing funds from the Treasury's cashflow for

government capital expenditure was not considered as a priority. However, depending on the

daily cashflow situation, only a limited amount of money is released specially to maintain the

capital stock. The same affidavit at 7(q) also highlights that there existed demands to settle

amounts of unpaid bills (around Rs. 106 billion by end 2022) either through releasing cash

whenever possible or issuing treasury bonds, and that unpaid bills would have significant

ramifications for key sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, fuel, food and construction, all of

which are critical for the socio-economic stabilization of the country. Learned ASG contended

that the above priority clearly considers and is in line with the obligations imposed on the State

by the Directive Principles of State Policy. In this backdrop, the learned ASG brought this

Court’s attention to the two cabinet decisions which compelled the Secretary to the Treasury,

to refer the request by the Chairman, Election Commission dated 07.03. 2023 marked 1R5 in

SC FR 69/2023 to the Minister of Finance which conveyed to the Chairman Election

Commission by letter dated 07.03,2023 marked 1R6 in SC FR 69/2023. The first Cabinet

Decision dated 07.02.2023 marked as part of 1R 4A in SC FR 69/2023 approved the Cabinet

Memorandum submitted by Minister of Finance marked 1R4B in SC FR 69/2023 (also see P6

and P7 in SC FR 139/2023) which contained the proposal to release imprest only for essential

expenditure identified therein as mentioned above, namely 22 items identified as recurrent

expenditure to be essentially incurred, expenditure related to capital development projects

financed through local funds and the long overdue payments and essential services such as

emergency maintenance and repairs. The 22 items mentioned above are as follows;

60

i. Payment of salaries and incentives

ii. Debt servicing

iii. Pensions

iv. Medical supplies of hospitals

v. Monthly samurdhi subsidies

vi. Financial assistance to elders

vii. Financial assistance to differently-abled low-income receivers

viii. Financial assistance to kidney patients

ix. Financial assistance proposed by the Budget to be paid to those who are affected by

economic difficulties.

x. Grade 5 scholarship allowances.

xi. Mahapola and bursaries.

xii. Thriposha programme

xiii. Farmers' pension

xiv. School nutrition programme

xv. Pre-school nutrition programme

xvi. Payment for war heroes/disabled soldiers.

xvii. Ranaviru mapiya rakawarana allowance

xviii. The unpostponable electricity, water, fuel and essential telecommunication services

xix. Food supplies to hospitals, prisons, security divisions

xx. Payments made in terms of agreements entered into in connection with maintenance

services, building rents, cleaning services, security services

xxi. Statutory payments such as EPF

xxii. Fertilizer subsidy

The second Cabinet Decision dated 13.02.2023, which is marked as P8 in SC FR 139/2023

along with the Petition or as part of 7R4(B) in SC FR 79/2023 along with the affidavit of the

Secretary to the Treasury, appears to have granted concurrence to a proposal by H.E the

President who is also the Minister of Finance. The said decision, as mentioned above, has given

direction to the utilization of any surplus of government revenue that would arise in February

2023. Thus, other than essential recurrent expenditure referred to in the previous Cabinet

Decision mentioned above any surplus of government revenue was to be utilized on priority

basis to meet the following expenditure

a) Purchase of paddy from farmers during Maha Season 2022/23

61

b) Expenditure related to minimizing malnutrition among children and pregnant mothers

c) Gratuity payments

d) Settlements of outstanding bills pertaining to Decentralized Budget Programme

e) Any other essential expenditure as found necessary and approved by the Minister of

Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies.

With these Cabinet Decisions the Secretary of the Treasury is required to get the approval of

the Minister of Finance to release funds for any other essential expenditure not covered by the

aforesaid two Cabinet Decisions. Other than the requests for funds made on behalf of the

holding of elections referred to in the letter marked P9 in SC FR 139/2023, after this Court

made Order in SC FR 69/2023 the Election Commission has again written to the Secretary

Minister of Finance to release funds in the manner described in the letter dated 07.03.2023

marked P13 in SC FR 139/2023. As such it is difficult to find fault with the Secretary to the

Treasury and Ministry of Finance for not releasing further funds as he referred the requests

made on behalf of the Election Commission to the Minister of Finance as reflected in the letters

dated 15.02.2023 and 07.03.2023 written by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to the

Chairman of the Election Commission marked P9 and P14 respectively in FR 139/2023. In P14

the said Secretary has specifically informed that once the approval is given the funds will be

released in the manner and time mentioned in the said P14 (also see 1R6 in SC FR 69/2023).

It appears such approval was never given even at the time of institution of these proceedings

or at the time litis contestatio was reached.

The learned ASG in his submissions stressed that the priority payments laid down by above

cabinet decisions relate to expenditure which is necessary to guarantee the right to life.

Referring to Janath S. Vidanage and Others v Pujith Jayasundara, Inspector General of

Police (SC/ FR/163, 165, 166, 184, 188, 191, 193, 195-198, 293/2019, SC Minutes of

12.01.2023) he highlighted that a person's right to life is not negotiable and the inability of the

State to provide for such secure environment is clearly in breach of and in violation of the

constitutional mandate and the privilege provided to a citizen of this country under the

Constitution. The learned ASG further argued that if the right to life is not protected other

fundamental rights, including rights guaranteed under Articles 10, 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the

Constitution would be meaningless. Referring to Section 9(3) of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act,

Section 27(3) of the Urban Councils Ordinance and Section 170(4) of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance, the learned ASG endeavored to indicate that there are mechanisms to provide the

62

services of the relevant authorities even if the Local Government Elections are not held. Further

the Central Government remains duty bound and capable to provide such services. It appears

what is intended to indicate by such submissions is that even there is no Local Government

bodies, necessary services can be provided through other mechanisms. However, such services

would be decided, planned and manned by the bureaucrats without any involvement of the

peoples’ representatives. Anyhow, this Court does not intend to questioned the State’s

incumbent responsibility to safeguard right to life of its citizenry. If the life standards of the

Citizens came to a such a precarious situation it was not the fault of the Citizenry but due to

the handling of the economy by the executive arm of the State, even though one may argue that

the present respondents are not responsible but their predecessors. Thus, the State cannot avoid

responsibility as its not anyone else’s fault. On the other hand, this Court does not intend to

analyze and decide the economic decisions to curtail certain payments and giving priority to

certain payments were correct or wrong or good or bad. This Court may not have the expertise

to do such a task. Other than certain reports presented by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Finance and Treasury, no party has tendered any analysis from an independent expert showing

inflow and outflow of money to the government coffers and the possibility of funding the Local

Government Elections. However, this does not hinder this Court’s ability to assess whether

there was any arbitrariness or capriciousness in the executive action in selecting the priorities

without considering the funds for Local Government polls.

In this regard, while quoting from Baker v Carr 369 U.S. 186(1962), Nixon v United States

506 U.S. 224 (1993), Vieth and Furey v Jubelirer et al 541 U.S. 267 (2004), S.R. Bommai

v Union of India [1994] 2 SCCR 644, V. Venkateswar Rao (V.V. Rao) v The Government

of Andhra Pradesh (Supreme Court of India Minutes of 05.10.2012), A.K. Kaul & another

v Union of India (1955) 4 SCC 73, N.K. Singh v Union of India (1994) 6 SCC 98, Kachchh

Jal Sankat Nivaran Samiti v State of Gujarat and Another (2013) 40 SCD 555, M. Ismail

Faruqui Dr. v Union of India (1994) 6 SCC 360, Premachandra v Major Montague

Jayawickrema and Another [1994] 2 Sri LR 90 it is argued that the doctrine of political

question applies and this Court may decline judicial review wherein there are no judicially

discoverable and manageable standards where a political judgment has been made based on

assessment of diverse and varied factors or where there are matters which are not susceptible

to the judicial process.

I do not intend to deliberate in detail with regard to the submissions made referring to political

question doctrine as I have already stated above, this Court is not going to decide on the

63

correctness of the decision to prioritize certain expenditure or to decide whether they are good

or bad decisions due to the lack of expertise this Court has to decide on economic decisions but

this Court is not barred in deciding whether such decisions were made arbitrarily or

capriciously in their decision making process. If the Petitioners challenge the correctness or

inappropriateness of the said priorities of expenditure, after all it is their responsibility to take

steps to prove such inappropriateness.

Perhaps, instead of getting an interim relief of which indirect intention appeared to be the

release of funds and which became fruitless at the end, if the Petitioners asked interim relief to

call for reports with regard to inflow and out flow of funds to the government coffers and

availability of or non-availability of foreign resources or local resources of funding, they could

have tendered an independent expert evidence through further pleadings as to the possibility of

holding elections against the priorities selected by the Respondents represented by the learned

ASG. If that happened, this Court would have been in a position to express its opinion with

regard to such decision with the help of such expert evidence.

Some of the Petitioners have brought this Court’s attention to the sums of money that were

spent on the Independence Day and the 'Janaraja Perahara'. This is not an application to see

whether such spending was prudent, correct or necessary. One may argue in a multi-cultural

society where people are divided to various sects, functions common to all sects has to be

celebrated even at a time of crisis to maintain national unity. Even one may be able to indicate

that even if the money spent on such events is saved it is not sufficient to raise the money

needed for the conducting of Local Government Elections and spending money on a task which

cannot be financed fully in the given circumstances is a waste of limited financial resources

the country had at the given time. However, it must be noted that at the commencement certain

amounts of money was released as mentioned before for this election purposes and it might

have also been a waste of resources. On the other hand, no facts have been placed before this

Court to indicate the amounts spent on those functions on previous occasions to see whether

there also the State has minimized the money to be spent. However, this type of spending of

funds indicates that on certain occasions the executive did not limit its expenditure to the

restrictions they themselves have created in the guise of managing limited resources available.

This raises the question whether, when the right to vote of the eligible voters throughout the

nation is in breach, not considering it as one area that should be given priority or at least one

should be approved when the request for funds were made, is arbitrary or not. It must be noted

in the Cabinet Memorandum or in the relevant Cabinet Decisions it is not contemplated at least

64

a date or time when the funding for the said election can be accommodated. Further, there

appears to be no response when the request for further funds for approval was placed before

the Minister of Finance who is H.E the President of the Republic as per P14 in SC FR 69/2023.

It is the duty of the H.E. the President in terms of article 33(c) of the Constitution to ensure the

creation of proper conditions for the conduct of elections at the request of the Election

Commission. It appears that now the Respondents represented by the learned ASG takes up the

position that there was no request from the Election Commission per se to the H.E. the

president. However, when H.E. the President and the Finance Minister is the same person

holding different portfolios and when H.E. the President can claim immunity even for his acts

related to different portfolios, in my view it is artificial to separate the two functions and say

that there was no request place before H.E. the President. It is also pertinent to note that as

explained below in this judgment when the Cabinet Memorandum was presented to the Cabinet

for approval it did not reveal any matters that will appraise the Cabinet with regard to its effect

on the ongoing election process. The conduct of the Minister of Finance establishes

arbitrariness in decision making.

It is argued that there has been only a delay which is reasonable considering the economic

situation of the Country and it is only denial and inordinate delay that would amount to

violation of fundamental rights. In this regard, the learned ASG has quoted Karunathilaka

and Another v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commission of Elections and Others (Case No.

1) [1999] 1 Sri LR 157 which refers to the conduct of the 1st respondent in that case resulted

in a grossly unjustified delay in the exercise of the right to vote, in violation of Article 14(1)(a),

Thavaneethan v Dayananda Dissanayake Commissioner of Elections and Others [2003]

1 Sri LR 74 which found the total denial which was not a mere delay as an occasion of violation

of Article 14(1)(a), Wijesekera v Attorney General [2007] 1 Sri LR 38 (Demerger case)

which considered a situation wherein the election for the North and East Provinces had been

postponed from time to time from 1988 up to the date of the case as a denial of the right which

caused a continuing infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, Mohamed Hussain

Hajiar Muhammed and Others v Election Commission of Sri Lanka and Others (Supra)

where there was a delay of two and half years.

It appears that the learned ASG’s attempt is to indicate that there was only a delay or a

postponement at the time of litis contestatio was reached but in my view, this is far from reality.

As per the aforesaid two Cabinet Decisions reflected in documents marked P6, P7 and P8 in

65

SC FR 139/2023 and as per the response of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance found in

P14 in the same brief, a situation has arisen that till the Minister of Finance decides and approve

the funds necessary for the holding of the Local Government Elections, the date of holding the

election has become indefinite. As stated in the case Mohamed Hussain Hajiar Muhammed

and Others (Supra) there is a legitimate expectation of the people to elect members of Local

Authorities of their choice. On the other hand, voting in an election is expression of that choice

and a choice of a voter may change with the time. If it is denied during the time when it was to

be expressed as envisaged by law that choice may be forever lost or replaced by a new choice.

If the time to express such choice is left to the executive who also wields political authority,

such authority may naturally select a time which is more suitable to the executive. Even a

candidate may lose his opportunity to be selected due to the change of choice of the people

with the lapse of time. In that backdrop creating a situation that the election should be held

when the Finance Minister decides to approve funds appears to be itself arbitrary when Article

15(2) envisage any restriction in relation to Article 14(1)(a) to be prescribed by law in the

interest of racial and religious harmony or in relation to parliamentary privilege, contempt of

court, defamation or incitement to an offence, only.

At this juncture it is also necessary to examine the aforementioned P6 in SC FR 139/2023

which is the Cabinet Memorandum signed and tendered by the Minister of Finance to the

Cabinet of Ministers setting out the priorities of expenditure for their approval. As the Minister

of Finance, he should have by then been aware of the requests for funds for the ongoing Local

Government Elections. Thus, he should have been conscious of the effect of the restrictions he

suggested for approval of the Cabinet but there is nothing in the said Memorandum that the

Minister of Finance appraised the Cabinet of Ministers of the effect that these restrictions

would cause on the ongoing Local Government Election. Thus, it speaks of an arbitrary attitude

which appears to have circumvented the Cabinet of Ministers to take an informed decision but

resulting in approving the selection of priorities according to the will of the Minister of Finance.

Even the Cabinet Decision reflected in the aforesaid letter marked P8 in SC FR 139/2023 is

made owing to certain matters stated to the Cabinet by H.E. the President who is also the

Minister of Finance. There is no material to indicate that the Cabinet of Ministers were

appraised with regard to the effect of the clause that Minister of Finance approval is necessary

for any other essential expenditure would cause on the ongoing election process and that the

holding of the said election would fall within his total control as he has to approve funds. The

above situation along with the avoidance of any response to the request for funds after the

66

Secretary of the Ministry referred to it to the Minister as reflected in P14, shows a conduct of

arbitrary nature as at least there was no indication as to when the request can be considered.

It appears that the Respondents represented by learned ASG endeavors to show that the said

decisions of the Cabinet and circulars based on that especially the decisions and circulars made

in terms of Section 7 of the Appropriation Act are restrictions prescribed by law. It appears this

is an attempt to face the argument raised by the Petitioners in SC FR 90/2023 that the rights

guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) are only subject to such restrictions prescribed by law. In

this regard the Respondents represented by the learned ASG has cited the following passage

from the Thavaneethan case (Supra)

“The PTA, as its preamble shows, was enacted for the purpose, inter alia, of maintaining

national security and public order; the regulations and order made under the PTA constitute

Law, and the restrictions contained therein constitute ‘restrictions prescribed by law’ for the

purpose of Article 15(7)”.

In my view, the impugned decisions in the matter at hand are executive decisions in relation to

the powers given to the Minister in terms of executing the Appropriation Act. Any circular

issued in relation to that relates to the execution of such executive decisions. If the law itself

says that right to vote or freedom of expression can be restricted through such decisions and

circulars then it may become a restriction prescribed by law. No such provision has been cited.

In the aforesaid Thavaneethan’s case it was further stated “that the term ‘law’ in the given

context should essentially constitute an Act of parliament or its recognized equivalent

promulgated in the interest of national security……” indicating that it has to be an Act of

Parliament or a recognized equivalent. In terms of Articles 75 and 76, the law has to be an Act

of Parliament, or Emergency Regulations made by H.E. the President or subordinate legislation

made by a person or body empowered by a law made by the Parliament. No such law that

empowers the Cabinet to restrict freedom of expression through its decisions or circulars

relating to such decision has been brought to the attention of this Court. Thus, the freedom of

expression can be restricted only in the manner prescribed in Article 15(7).

It is also argued that the maxim ‘Lex non ad cogit impossiblia’ applies due to the non-

availability of resources as it created a situation that made the Respondents incapable of

providing funds for holding elections. As explained if the funds that was in the Government

was depleted it was not the fault of the Petitioners, but of the authorities of the State who were

responsible for the management of the Economy of the Country whether present or past. Thus,

67

the State is liable for any infringement caused by the denial of voting during the time it should

have been made available. On the other hand, other than referring to the economic crisis and

difficulties faced, affidavit of the Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance has not

averred sufficient material to indicate a total inability hold the elections. While arguing that

matters should be decided as at the date of litis contestatio was reached, the learned ASG on

the other hand, as shown above, wants this court to take into consideration new objections and

also wants to consider two documents, namely Midyear Fiscal Report and Budget Economic

and Fiscal Position Report, which were not tendered along with the objection or with an

additional affidavit to be considered in deciding this inability, for which some Petitioners have

objected. It is true that they are statutory reports made in terms of Fiscal Management

(Responsibility) Act and reports that were placed before the Parliament. It is also true that this

Court can take judicial notice of the course of proceedings before the Legislature, but these

reports contain facts for which the Petitioners could not respond through counter objections.

Even if there was a difficulty in submitting these reports with the objections due to non-

availability or for some other reason the relevant facts as applicable at the time of filing of

objections could have shown and pleaded in the objections. If they were so pleaded the opposite

parties could have analyzed the facts and placed a different expert opinion through counter

objections for the consideration of this Court, if they want to challenge such facts. In that back

drop, it is not proper to consider the facts contained in those reports in adjudicating the issues

involved in this matter. However, as per the reports filed with the Objections marked 1R1 and

1R3 indicates that there was a budget deficit and cash flow issues, even if there was a difficulty

in raising funds through foreign loans due to the crisis it is not still clear why the money could

not have been raised through local resources such as treasury bonds. Nothing in the objections,

to my understanding indicate that if the money necessary for the election was raised, it would

exceed any limit approved by the Parliament. Mere words that inflation might have increased

is not sufficient to decide the reasonableness of such decisions unless it is shown how it could

have resulted in an irrecoverable collapse of the economy causing hardships to the masses.

Operating the economy at a Budget deficit may not be a new thing to our country. The

Respondents failed to place any material before this Court through their objections, that either

there was no way to raise money even locally to hold elections or even if funds were raised,

the adverse nature of its effect empirically on the inflation and cost of living etc. Mere

statements that it would increase the inflation and the country would have to experience the

difficulties that it faced without fuel, power, medications and other essentials as experienced

sometimes ago may not suffice to show such decisions were essential and not capricious. On

68

the other hand, the restrictions proposed to the Cabinet were by the Minister of Finance and

H.E the President, but no affidavit is tendered by the Minister of Finance to justify the selection

of such restrictions. Perhaps these restrictions are proposed by various officials in the Finance

Ministry but when it is tendered to the Cabinet under the signature of the Minister of Finance,

he has to take the responsibility of what is so tendered. In that back drop, this Court cannot be

satisfied that there was sufficient material placed before this Court to show that there was a

total impossibility to hold the Local Government Polls and that the decision-making process

was not tainted with arbitrariness.

It is also contended by some of the Respondents that there are certain limitations placed upon

the jurisdiction of this Court as this matter relates to public finance. In this regard, the attention

of this Court has been brought to Articles 4(c), 118 and 148 of the Constitution. Article 148

provide that ‘Parliament shall have the full control over the public finance’. As per Article 4(c)

the judicial power of the people may be directly exercised by the Parliament with regard to

matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of the Parliament and of its Members

and the jurisdiction of courts is excluded with regard to them. The learned ASG contended that

the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court exercised in terms of Article 126 read with

Article 118 of the Constitution is subject to the provisions of the Constitution and as such is

subject to the provisions in Article 4(c) and 148. Referring to Attorney General v Dr.

U.A.B.W.M.R.S.A. Bandaranayake S C Appeal/67/2013, SC minutes of 21.02.2014 which

identified the existence of sui generis powers other than legislative powers, it is contended that

the power conferred upon the Parliament by Article 148 is a sui generis power.

It is also brought to the notice of this court that in the Special Determination on the

Appropriation Bill (2008) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2007-

2009) Vol IX 44 at 45] it is stated as follows:

“In the Determination made by a Bench of Seven Judges in regard to the Bill titled the 19th

Amendment to the Constitution (S.D. No. 11-40/2002) this Court laid down the manner in

which the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution as to sovereignty of the People and

its exercise have to be interpreted. According to that Determination in terms of Article 4(a) of

the Constitution, Parliament is the custodian of legislative power of the People and will

exercise that power in trust for the People in whom sovereignty is reposed. Legislative power

includes the "full control over public finance" as stated in Article 148 cited above, which in

69

our opinion is also a vital component of the balance of power firmly established by the

Constitution in relation to the respective organs of government.

Article 30(1) of the Constitution states that the President is the "Head of the Executive and of

the Government". In terms of Article 43(1), the Cabinet of Ministers is charged with the

direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible and answerable to

Parliament. One important check on the exercise of executive power is that finance required

for such exercise remains within the full control of Parliament - the legislature. There are three

vital components of such control in terms of the Constitution viz:

(1) control of the sources of finance i.e. imposition of taxes, levies, rates and the like and

the creation of any debt of the Republic;

(2) control by way of allocation of public finance to the respective departments and agencies

of Government and setting limits of such expenditure;

(3) control by way of continuous audit and check as to due diligence in performance in

relation to (1) and (2).

Since such control is exercised by Parliament in trust for the People, we are of the opinion that

the process should be transparent and in the public domain, so that People who remain

Sovereign are informed as to the manner of control is exercised.”

The case of Appropriation Bill (2012) [Decision of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills

(2010-2012) Vol.X 109 has been cited to indicate that the Parliament must exercise such

control in a manner transparent and the Parliament’s control is at a macro-level and the

Parliament is not expected to micro manage the finances of the Government. Our attention was

also brought to the provisions of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act to show how this

control takes place through placing certain reports before the Parliament for the scrutiny by the

Parliament or by a relevant Parliamentary Committee.

The 12th Respondent in SC FR 90/2023, the Director General of Government Information also

has expressed similar views in his written submissions and he associates with the submissions

made by the learned ASG. In those written submissions he has quoted the following passages

from the decision in the old case (19th Century) of The Queen v Lord Commissioners of the

Treasury L.R. 7 Q.B. 387

“The effect of the annual Appropriation Act is not to give any third person a right to the money;

but it is to prevent the Crown from appropriating money given for one púrpose to another. The

70

money is not a charge on the Consolidated Fund, although it comes out of that fund; it is voted

annually. The effect of the schedule to the Act is not that the sum named shall be appropriated

to the purposes mentioned, but that the Treasury shall not apply a sum beyond that which is

mentioned to those purposes; it is not an enabling but a restrictive Act; and the meaning of the

word "appropriated" is appropriated as between the Crown and the House of Commons; there

is no obligation on the Treasury to pay any sums; but they may pay them. These sums are given

to the Crown, and there is no legal obligation on the Crown which this Court can enforce.

Further, it is discretionary with the Treasury what amount shall be expended. ..." (page 390).

“I cannot see anything in that statute which imposes a duty at Law upon the Lords

Commissioners of the Treasury. It may be a duty that they owe to the Crown, or it may be a

duty that they owe to parliament to apply this money in discharge of the amounts which the

counties are compelled without any choice on their part to pay; but it is a duty to the Queen or

a duty to parliament, and it is not a duty at law which by any legal proceeding or by the exercise

of the prerogative jurisdiction of this Court we can enforce." (page 395).

However, this Court also observes that as per the Appropriation Act No.23 of 2022, the

Minister among other powers has power on certain occasions to transfer money from one

allocation to another – vide Section 5 and 6. The Minister also has the power to limit

expenditure previously authorized and to withdraw money already released under the authority

of a warrant issued by him but with the approval of the government- vide section 7.

Referring to the same case quoted above H.W.R Wade and C F Forsyth in their 11th Edition

of Administrative Law by Oxford University Press at page 530 states as follows;

“Similarly, no mandatory order will issue to the Treasury to pay monies appropriated by

Parliament for a given purpose, since the money is granted to the crown, and even though it is

in the hands of the Treasury, they are merely the instrument of the Crown for handling the

Money.”

The Director General of Government Information Department in his written submissions has

referred to the following decisions of this Court which have held that decisions based on

economic considerations must largely be left to the Legislature in view of the inherent

complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements that requires to be made.

Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill (Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills

(1978-1983), Vol. L, 99 at 100), Default Taxes (Special Provisions) Bill (Decisions of the

71

Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2007-2009), Vol. IX, 63 at 64), Inland Revenue Bill

(Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2016-2017), Vol. XIII, 105 at 107,

Inland Revenue Bill (Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2016-2017), Vol.

XIII, 105 at 107), Inland Revenue Bill (Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary

Bills (2016-2017), Vol. XIII, 105 at 107) and Inland Revenue Amendment Bill (SC.S.D

No.3/1980) ( Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1978-1989), Vol. 1 99

at 100.

Anyhow, the arguments, that take up the position that the full control of public finance is a

prerogative of the Parliament, is to indicate that this Court should not interfere with that

function. This Court interferes with the control of public finance only if this Court decides and

directs as to the manner the public finance should be utilized and / or if this Court engages in

a decision making which evaluated the good and bad or appropriateness of the said decisions.

However, said provisions, in my view does not create any obstacle to see whether the executive

was arbitrary or capricious in its decision making. Such a decision will not overlap with the

powers of Parliament to control public finance.

It appears that the Director General of Government Information in his written submission takes

up the position that the process of selecting priorities and placing it for Cabinet approval cannot

be challenged as it relates to public finance and it is subject to the control by Parliament which

is a legislative process. He quotes the following statement made in Mathiaparanam Abraham

Sumanthiran v Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana SC FR 37/2024, SC Minutes

29.02.2024,

“..legislative process commences with the line ministry forwarding a memorandum to the

Cabinet seeking approval from the Cabinet to enact legislation on the matter referred to in the

memorandum….”

However, the Cabinet Memorandum for the approval of priorities for certain expenditure was

not to pass a law. Even it is considered as one relates to public finance as explained above this

Court’s power to see whether the executive decisions that relates to the said memorandum are

arbitrary or not, does not overlap with the powers of Parliament to control the public finance.

The learned ASG has submitted that the Contingency Fund referred to in Article 151 is not a

viable alternative to finance the Local Government Election 2023 and it is for the purposes of

unforeseen urgent expenditure but not for the foreseen expenditure such as elections. He also

submits facts to indicate that such fund has not been maintained. If such fund was there, it could

72

have relieved the burden created by economic crisis to some extent and making it possible for

the money allocated for elections retain for the allocated purpose.

Even though the learned ASG has made submissions that the actions brought by the Petitioners

are not in the public interest as pleaded by them, this issue need not be further discussed as all

the applications have been filed in their own right as Petitioners along with a plea to consider

the application as an application filed on behalf the public. Thus, the Petitioners have right to

proceed with as an application filed on their own rights.

In their written submissions Petitioners in SC FR 139/2023 have taken up the position that, in

view of the decision of this Court in SC Contempt 02/2023 and 03 /2023, where it was decided

that the Secretary to the Treasury was not in a position to accept the responsibility of

withholding or issuing the funds for the Local Government Election 2023, he does not have

any standing to object or respond to the instant fundamental right application. That decision

was with regard to the penal consequences as he was charged for contempt. As he has been

made a respondent and was the one with whom the Election Commission communicated with

for funding and also being the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury who is in

charge of the administration of those institution, he has a right to respond to the allegation.

Thus, the submissions made by the learned ASG which are based on the objections of the

Secretary to the Treasury cannot be totally rejected and thus considered above in making this

decision.

As per the analysis made above this Court arrives at the following findings:

1. Executive Branch of the State represented by Honourable Attorney General is liable for

infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of

the Constitution for not holding Local Government Election 2023.

2. The impugned acts and omissions of the Chairman and the members of the Election

Commission who held office during the period of time relevant to these applications

(for ease of convenience, Nimal Punchihewa, S.B.Divaratne, M.M.Mohamed,

K.P.P.Pathirana and P.S.M. Charles) had resulted in the infringement of the

fundamental right guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution for lack of

73

proper planning and managing the process and for not using its powers to issue

appropriate directions.

3. The impugned acts and omissions of H.E. the President who is also the Minister of

Finance that were impugned by making these applications against the Honourable

Attorney General had resulted in the infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed

under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution due to arbitrary and unlawful

conduct explained in this judgment which resulted in the non-holding of the Local

Government Elections 2023.

4. The Secretary to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance is not made liable as there is

no material that he failed to cooperate with the functions of the Election Commission.

He had acted in accordance with the directions of the Cabinet of Ministers and the

Minister of Finance.

5. The Cabinet of Ministers are not made liable as they have not been properly appraised

of the effect of restrictions imposed on expenditure, on the holding of Elections when

their approval for such restrictions was sought.

6. The Government Printer and the IGP are not made liable as there is no sufficient

material to show collusive action. The Election Commission should have exercised

their powers and authority vested on them by the Constitution to obtain their services.

7. The Director General of Government Information is not made liable as there is no

sufficient material to show any collusive action.

8. Other Respondents who are not referred to above are not made liable as there is no

material to show that they did not want to cooperate with the functions of the Election

Commission.

74

As remedial measures this Court makes the following directions;

1. The Election Commission is directed to schedule the Local Government Elections

2023 at the earliest possible with due regard to their duty to hold other elections as

required by law.

2. The Election Commission is further directed to exercise their powers and authority

vested by law and obtain assistance from the relevant State agencies, in holding the

said election,

3. State is directed to pay Rupees One Hundred and Fifty Thousand as costs in each

case.
