SC/APPEAL/75/2017

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action, naming two defendants, seeking to partition

the land described in the schedule to the plaint among the plaintiff and

the 1st defendant. The plaintiff is the son of the 1st defendant and the 2nd

defendant is the brother of the 1st defendant.

The preliminary plan No. 510 dated 16.06.1998 consists of lots 1 and 2.

The position taken up by the 2nd defendant-appellant at the trial by way

of issues was that he is entitled to lot 1 of the preliminary plan by

prescription.

After trial, the District Court refused the prescriptive claim of the 2nd

defendant and partitioned the land between the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed it.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the following two questions:

(a) Did both courts below investigate title to the land in question as

required in a partition action?

(b) In any event, did the respondent have title to the corpus?

The point made by learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd defendant-

appellant before this court was that the plaintiff became entitled to 8

perches from lot 1 in plan No. 1839 dated 31.07.1956 but he filed the

partition action to partition lot 2 in plan No. 1839. However, he admits

that the preliminary plan depicts lot 1 in plan No. 1839. It is on that

basis, learned Presidents Counsel states that the District Court has

failed to investigate title to the land to be partitioned.

In the written submissions filed before this court, learned Presidents

Counsel states thus:

5

SC/APPEAL/75/2017

The plaintiff Somarathne was seeking to partition lot 2 in plan 1839.

It is respectfully submitted that Somarathna could not partition lot 2

as he got 8 perches from lot 1 and lot 2 was given to Cornelis

Appuhamy. The preliminary plan No. 510 dated 16.06.1998, G.

Saranasena licensed surveyor shows not lot 2 but lot 1. The surveyor

has surveyed a different land to the land in the plaint.

The description of the land in the schedule to the plaint is unclear. It

identifies the land as lot 2(1) of plan No. 1839 with an extent of 22.5

perches. However, the lot number does not align with either lot 1 or lot 2

of plan No. 1839 but rather refers to both. Notably, each lot 1 and lot 2

of plan No. 1839 has an extent of 22.5 perches.

The preliminary plan No. 510 and its report were marked as X and X1 at

the trial without objection. There was no objection at any stage of the

District Court proceedings or High Court proceedings that the

preliminary plan does not depict the land to be partitioned. There is no

dispute that the land depicted in the preliminary plan is lot 1 of plan No.

1839. It is clearly stated in the preliminary plan itself. According to the

report X1, the land to be partitioned had been shown to the surveyor by

the plaintiff and the two defendants. In the preliminary plan the land is

shown as lots 1 and 2. The 2nd defendant in his evidence in chief itself

categorically stated that the land to be partitioned is depicted as lots 1

and 2 in the preliminary plan. There was no dispute on the identification

of the corpus in the District Court or in the High Court. The 2nd defendant

raised issues on the basis that he prescribed to lot 1 of the preliminary

plan. When the 2nd defendant failed his claim on prescriptive title, he

cannot now be permitted to thwart the partition action filed more than

27 years ago by raising a technical objection on the identification of the

corpus comparing the schedule to the plaint with the land shown in the

preliminary plan.

6

SC/APPEAL/75/2017

The identification of the corpus is a question of fact or, at least, a mixed

question of fact and law. It is not a pure question of law that can be raised

for the first time on appeal. Therefore, a party to an action cannot raise

the question of identification of the corpus for the first time before the

High Court or in the Supreme Court, whether it is a partition case or a

land case.

I answer the two questions on which leave was granted in the affirmative

and dismiss the appeal with costs.
