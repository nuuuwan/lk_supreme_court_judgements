"(1982), under the topic ‘The law in the field and the law in the book’ states"
"at page 136:"
"The traditional attitudes of lawyers, in the application of their legal"
"knowledge,  has  been  to  confine  their  attention  to  the  black  letter"
"rules or principles appearing between the covers of their law books."
"Deeply learned in the contents of these books, they would research"
"the  legal  principles  involved  with  the  utmost  thoroughness,  and"
"apply them to the facts before them. That task accomplished, their"
"interest in the matter would cease. They would not follow through"
"into its social impacts the decision they had thus applied, and they"
"would  go  on  to  half  a  hundred  similar  cases,  applying  their  book"
"knowledge  to  them  without  any  feedback  from  the  field.  Indeed"
"many a modern court still does just that."
