SC/APPEAL/139/2019"
"Undefended accused"
"Although in the High Court, the accused is typically provided with legal"
"representation,  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court,  this  may  not  always  be  the"
"case. When the accused is undefended, it becomes the responsibility of"
"the judge to explain to the accused his right to make an application under"
"the  proviso  to  section  48  of  the  Judicature  Act  to  ensure  a  fair  trial."
"However, it is ultimately the judge’s discretion to decide whether to allow"
"or disallow that application based on the unique facts and circumstances"
"of the case."
"As the Supreme Court held in Kiri Mahaththaya’s case (supra), failure on"
"the part of the judge to do so itself will not vitiate the conviction unless it"
"can  be  demonstrated 
that 
such 
failure 
caused  prejudice 
to 
the"
"substantial rights of the accused or resulted in a failure of justice."
"In  SC/APPEAL/2/2022, 
the  appellant,  Hettiarachchilage  Wasantha"
"Rathna, was undefended when the second Magistrate took over the trial."
"The appellant did not make an application to the succeeding Magistrate"
"in terms of the proviso to section 48 of the Judicature Act to resummon"
"and rehear witness No. 1 whose evidence had already been led, nor did"
"the learned Magistrate explain it to the appellant. The learned Magistrate"
"proceeded  with  the  trial  without  recording  the 
fact  of  adoption  of"
"evidence. After trial, the appellant was convicted for the charge (section"
"345 of the Penal Code) and the High Court affirmed it."
"According to Article 13(3) of the Constitution, the right to a fair trial is a"
"fundamental right."
