"the exception, not the rule. This was explained by S.N. Silva C.J. in Vilma"
"Dissanayake v. Leslie Dharmaratne [2008] 2 Sri LR 184 at 185:"
"It is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue proceedings since"
"there are changes of Judges holding office in a particular Court due"
"to transfers, promotions and the like. It is in these circumstances that"
"Section 48 was amended giving a discretion to a Judge to continue"
"with the proceedings. Hence the exercise of such discretion should"
"not be disturbed unless there are serious issues with regard to the"
"demeanour  of  any  witness  recorded  by  the  Judge  who  previously"
"heard the case."
