"demand, vb. 1. To claim as one’s due; to require; to seek relief. 2. To"
"summon; to call into court"
"The above analysis was lucidly explained by Salam J. in Somapala v. The"
"Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption (supra):"
"The expression “demand” as used in the proviso to section 48 has"
"been  often  misunderstood  and  misapplied  in  the  course  of  legal"
"proceedings. By the reason of this misunderstanding at times it is"
"argued that by the use of the expression “demand” the Legislature"
"intended or conferred no discretion in the hands of the Judge. The"
"fact that the Legislature has purposely omitted the phrase “in which"

"proviso is not only has done away with the requirement of having to"
"commence proceedings afresh but even the “request” (ඉල්ීම) to recall"
"a witness is also placed within the exclusive discretion of the judge."
"As such when section 48 is carefully looked at, no difficulty needs"
