"Amila Palliyage for the Accused-Appellant-Petitioner in"
"SC/SPL/LA/267/2018."
"Argued on:  12.12.2023"
"Decided on: 05.04.2024"
"Samayawardhena, J."
"Background"
"The appellant in SC/APPEAL/139/2019, Chandana Sri Lal Gurusinghe,"
"was indicted before the High Court of Negombo for murder. Evidence of"
"five  prosecuting  witnesses  was 
led  before 
two  High  Court  Judges."
"Evidence of one witness was led before the third High Court Judge. After"
"the prosecution case was closed, the appellant made a dock statement."
"This was followed by closing submissions from learned counsel for both"
"parties.  The  third  High  Court  Judge  delivered  the  judgment  convicting"
"the accused of the offence. On appeal, learned counsel for the appellant"
"took up the position for the first time that the judgment was delivered by"
"the third High Court Judge without any “entry of adoption of proceedings”"
"and therefore, it vitiates the conviction. The Court of Appeal accepted that"
"argument and set aside the judgment of the High Court and ordered trial"
"de novo without going into the merits of the appeal. The Attorney General"
"appealed against this judgment."
"There were several appeals/leave to appeal applications pending before"
"this  Court  where 
this  point 
(presence  of  an  entry  of  adoption  of"
"proceedings)  had  been  raised.  Together  with  SC/APPEAL/139/2019,"
