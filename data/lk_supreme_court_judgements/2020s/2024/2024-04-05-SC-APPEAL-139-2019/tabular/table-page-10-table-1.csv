"prejudiced  the  substantial  rights  of  the  parties  or  occasioned  a"
"failure of justice."
"In Kiri Mahaththaya and Another v. Attorney General [2020] 1 Sri LR 10,"
"the Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether non-compliance"
"with section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which mandates"
"the High Court to read and explain the indictment  to the accused  and"
"ask  whether  he  pleads  guilty  or  not  guilty  of  the  offence  charged"
"(arraignment  of  accused),  vitiates  the  conviction.  There  were  several"
"previous decisions which held that it does. The Supreme Court confirmed"
"that  the  absence  of  the  words  “indictment  read  and  explained”  in  the"
"record,  along  with  the  failure  to  record  the  plea  of  guilty  or  not  guilty,"
"amounts to non-compliance with section 196. Nevertheless, the Supreme"
"Court  did  not  adopt  a  mechanical  approach  to  this  issue.  Instead,  the"
"Court  concluded  that  non-compliance  with  section  196  by  itself  would"
"not  automatically  invalidate  the  conviction.  The  Supreme  Court  firmly"
"held that if the conviction is to be vitiated, the appellant must satisfy the"
"Court that such non-compliance has caused prejudice to the substantial"
"rights of the accused or has occasioned a failure of justice, as stipulated"
"in the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution. Aluwihare J. (with the"
"agreement of Jayawardena J. and Murdu Fernando J.) emphasised this"
"at pages 18-19:"
