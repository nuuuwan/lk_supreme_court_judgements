Background

The appellant in SC/APPEAL/139/2019, Chandana Sri Lal Gurusinghe,

was indicted before the High Court of Negombo for murder. Evidence of

five prosecuting witnesses was led before two High Court Judges.

Evidence of one witness was led before the third High Court Judge. After

the prosecution case was closed, the appellant made a dock statement.

This was followed by closing submissions from learned counsel for both

parties. The third High Court Judge delivered the judgment convicting

the accused of the offence. On appeal, learned counsel for the appellant

took up the position for the first time that the judgment was delivered by

the third High Court Judge without any entry of adoption of proceedings

and therefore, it vitiates the conviction. The Court of Appeal accepted that

argument and set aside the judgment of the High Court and ordered trial

de novo without going into the merits of the appeal. The Attorney General

appealed against this judgment.

There were several appeals/leave to appeal applications pending before

this Court where this point (presence of an entry of adoption of

proceedings) had been raised. Together with SC/APPEAL/139/2019,

6

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

another appeal namely, SC/APPEAL/2/2022 was argued. Learned

counsel for the appellant-petitioner in SC/SPL/LA/267/2018 agreed to

abide by the judgment in SC/APPEAL/139/2019.

In SC/APPEAL/139/2019, this Court granted leave to appeal on two

questions of law:

(a) Does a Court of first instance require the fact of adopting evidence

by the succeeding judge to be recorded in order to comply with

section 48 of the Judicature Act, as amended, when there was no

demand by an accused person to resummon and rehear the

witnesses?

(b) Would the Court of Appeal be correct in law in holding that the

absence of a record of adoption of evidence in the above

circumstances vitiates the proceedings, without considering the

matter before it?

The substantive rights of the accused and failure of justice

There is no dispute in the instant case (SC/APPEAL/139/2019) that both

parties agreed for the third High Court Judge to adopt the evidence

already led and proceed with the trial. The learned High Court Judge

expressly stated this at pages 3 and 10 of the judgment;

,

.2

. The only issue in this appeal is the failure

of the learned High Court Judge to record it in the proceedings. In that

backdrop, there is no justification whatsoever for the Court of Appeal to

set aside the judgment of the High Court and order a trial de novo as the

omission or irregularity, if any, has not prejudiced the substantial rights

7

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice as the proviso to Article

138(1) of the Constitution dictates.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution which delineates the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal reads as follows:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by

the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction

or by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and

sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and

restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all other laws must

be interpreted consistently with the Constitution. The language of the

proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution makes it mandatory for the

Court of Appeal not to reverse or vary the judgments, decrees or orders

of the original Courts on any error, defect, or irregularity unless such

error, defect, or irregularity has prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

All statutory laws also conform to this, perhaps reiterating it for

overemphasis.

8

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

Section 334(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, as

amended, reads as follows:

The Court of Appeal on any appeal against conviction on a verdict of

a jury shall allow the appeal if it thinks that such verdict should be

set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be

supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the

court before which the appellant was convicted should be set aside

on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of any law or that

on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other

case shall dismiss the appeal:

Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that

the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the

appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial

miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

Section 456A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

9

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The failure to comply with any provision of this Code shall not affect

or be deemed to have affected the validity of any complaint,

committal or indictment or the admissibility of any evidence unless

such failure has occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice.

Section 5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.

19 of 1990 reads as follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

for a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered

and made by any District Court or a Family Court within such

Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors

in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such District Court

or Family Court, as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of

1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to

the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the

Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a

reference to a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved by any

judgment, decree or order of a District Court or a Family Court, as

the case may be, within a Province, may invoke the jurisdiction

referred to in that subsection, in the High Court established for that

Province:

Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a Family

Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by the High

Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

10

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.

In Kiri Mahaththaya and Another v. Attorney General [2020] 1 Sri LR 10,

the Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether non-compliance

with section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which mandates

the High Court to read and explain the indictment to the accused and

ask whether he pleads guilty or not guilty of the offence charged

(arraignment of accused), vitiates the conviction. There were several

previous decisions which held that it does. The Supreme Court confirmed

that the absence of the words indictment read and explained in the

record, along with the failure to record the plea of guilty or not guilty,

amounts to non-compliance with section 196. Nevertheless, the Supreme

Court did not adopt a mechanical approach to this issue. Instead, the

Court concluded that non-compliance with section 196 by itself would

not automatically invalidate the conviction. The Supreme Court firmly

held that if the conviction is to be vitiated, the appellant must satisfy the

Court that such non-compliance has caused prejudice to the substantial

rights of the accused or has occasioned a failure of justice, as stipulated

in the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution. Aluwihare J. (with the

agreement of Jayawardena J. and Murdu Fernando J.) emphasised this

at pages 18-19:

With the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, if relief is to be

obtained in an appeal, a party must satisfy the threshold

requirement laid down in the proviso to Article 138(1), which is

placed under the heading The Court of Appeal. The proviso to the

said Article of the Constitution lays down that Provided that no

judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

11

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms and the burden

is on the party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned

error, defect or irregularity has either prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. It must be

observed that no such Constitutional provision is to be found either

in the 1948 Soulbury Constitution or the First Republican

Constitution of 1972.

The Constitutional provision embodied in Article 138(1) cannot be

overlooked and must be given effect to. None of the decisions (made

after 1978) relied upon by the Appellants with regard to the issue

that this court is now called upon to decide, appear to have

considered the constitutional provision in the proviso to Article

138(1). It is a well-established canon of interpretation, that the

Constitution overrides a statute as the grundnorm. All statutes must

be construed in line with the highest law. Judges from time

immemorial have in their limited capacity, essayed to fill the gaps

whenever it occurred to them, in keeping with the contemporary

times, in statutes which do not align with the Constitution. However,

such interpretations are not words etched in stone.

As the respected American jurist, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo said,

The rules and principles of case law have never been treated as

final truths, but as working hypotheses, continually retested in those

great laboratories of the law, the courts of justice. Every new case is

an experiment; and if the accepted rule which seems applicable

yields a result which is felt to be unjust, the rule is reconsidered

(The Nature of the Judicial Process, 1921).

12

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The learned counsel on behalf of the Accused-Appellants had heavily

relied on a number of decisions handed down by this court as well

as by the Court of Appeal, in support of the proposition that the trial

should be declared a nullity in view of the non-compliance with

Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. However, I am of

the view that these decisions need to be revisited in light of the

Constitutional provision referred to above.

Having regard to the facts of that case, the Supreme Court dismissed the

appeal on the basis that the omission of a formal arraignment had neither

prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused nor occasioned a failure

of justice.

Given the facts of the instant appeal, I have no option but to set aside the

impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal on the basis that the lack of

entry in the case record has not caused prejudice to the substantial rights

of the accused nor occasioned a failure of justice.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act

However, the question of law raised in the instant appeal is of general

applicability as there are several appeals pending in this Court on the

same question of law. Learned counsel in those cases have agreed to

abide by this judgment on the question of adoption of evidence under

section 48 of the Judicature Act. Therefore, further consideration of the

matter is necessary.

It is common ground that the question of adoption of proceedings is

mainly governed by section 48 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, as

amended by the Judicature (Amendment) Act, No. 27 of 1999.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act as it stood before the amendment read

as follows:

13

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office,

absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before

whom any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any

inquiry preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been

instituted or is pending, such action, prosecution, proceeding or

matter may be continued before the successor of such Judge who

shall have power to act on the evidence already recorded by his

predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly

recorded by him or, if he thinks fit, to re-summon the witness and

commence the proceedings afresh:

Provided that in any such case, except on an inquiry preliminary to

committal for trial, either party may demand that the witnesses be

re-summoned and re-heard, in which case the trial shall commence

afresh.

It must first be clarified that the principal part of this section applies to

the judge, while the proviso applies to the parties to the action. The

section as a whole encompasses both civil and criminal proceedings.

Under section 48 (without the proviso), the succeeding judge has the

power to act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor or, if

deemed appropriate, to resummon the witnesses and commence

proceedings afresh. The judge has the discretion. However, I must hasten

to add that there is no unfettered, untrammeled and unbridged

discretion. The judge must exercise the discretion judiciously and not

capriciously. As Lord Wrenbury in the celebrated House of Lords decision

in Roberts v. Hopwood [1925] AC 578 at 613 articulated he must in the

exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other

words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course

which reason directs. He must act reasonably.

14

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The resummoning of witnesses and commencing proceedings de novo is

the exception, not the rule. This was explained by S.N. Silva C.J. in Vilma

Dissanayake v. Leslie Dharmaratne [2008] 2 Sri LR 184 at 185:

It is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue proceedings since

there are changes of Judges holding office in a particular Court due

to transfers, promotions and the like. It is in these circumstances that

Section 48 was amended giving a discretion to a Judge to continue

with the proceedings. Hence the exercise of such discretion should

not be disturbed unless there are serious issues with regard to the

demeanour of any witness recorded by the Judge who previously

heard the case.

In Krishnakumar v. Attorney General [2021] 2 Sri LR 454 at 458,

Abayakoon J. stated:

I find that the plain reading of section 48 of the Judicature Act, as

amended by Act No. 27 of 1999 is very much clearer as to the

intention of the legislature. The intention has been to provide for the

conclusion, as expeditiously as possible, a trial commenced before

another judge without causing prejudice to an accused person. The

legislature in its wisdom has provided for the trial judge to continue

with the trial by acting on the evidence previously recorded by his

predecessor, but by the proviso of the section has provided an

opportunity for an accused in a criminal prosecution to demand that

the witness may be re-summoned and reheard ensuring the right of

an accused for a fair trial.

In Central Finance Company PLC v. Chandrasekera [2020] 1 Sri LR 161,

the trial was concluded before one judge in the Commercial High Court

and the judgment was reserved. Before the judge could prepare and

deliver the judgment, he was elevated to the Court of Appeal. The

15

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

succeeding judge, presumably acting under section 48 of the Judicature

Act, without informing the parties, dismissed the plaintiffs action on the

basis that the affidavit evidence of the main witness of the plaintiff is not

in the case record. On appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment.

Prasanna Jayawardena J. at page 178 held:

In my view, in instances where a succeeding judge is called upon to

deliver judgment in a case where the evidence has been concluded

before his predecessor, the requirement that the discretion vested by

section 48 of the Judicature Act in the succeeding judge must be

exercised reasonably, places a duty on the succeeding judge to have

the case called in open court and notify the parties that he (the

succeeding judge) is required to deliver judgment since his

predecessor is unavailable. At that time, the succeeding judge

should give the parties an opportunity to be heard with regard to

which course of action outlined in section 48 should be followed.

Having considered the submissions made by the parties on that

question, the succeeding judge is entitled to make Order as to the

manner in which he decides to exercise the discretion vested in him

by section 48.

It should be borne in mind that in the above case, no evidence was led

before the judge who dismissed the action; all the evidence was led before

his predecessor. It is in that context Jayawardena J. stated that where a

succeeding judge is called upon to deliver the judgment in a case where

no evidence had been led before him, it is obligatory on the succeeding

judge to have the case called in open Court and notify the parties that he

is required to deliver the judgment since his predecessor is unavailable

and decide which of the three lines of actions referred to in the principal

part of section 48 should be followed, i.e. (a) to act on the evidence already

recorded by his predecessor, or (b) partly recorded by his predecessor and

16

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

partly recorded by him or, (c) if he thinks fit, to re-summon the witness

and commence the proceedings afresh.

Under the proviso (before the amendment), any party to the action,

whether civil or criminal, could demand that the witnesses be

resummoned and reheard. In such cases, the Court was bound to

commence the trial afresh (the trial shall commence afresh).

The proviso was abused by some parties to prolong the trial in

furtherance of their ulterior motives, thereby significantly contributing to

the perennial problem of laws delays. Hence, the legislature, by the

Judicature (Amendment) Act, No. 27 of 1999, repealed the proviso and

substituted it with the following:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter

(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued

before the successor of any such judge, the accused may demand

that the witnesses be resummoned and reheard.

This was explained by Salam J. in Somapala v. The Commission to

Investigate Bribery and Corruption (CA (PHC) APN 37/2009, CA Minutes

of 03.02.2010) in this manner:

It is common knowledge that the proviso to section 48 worked

tremendous hardship to the parties both in criminal and civil matters

whenever a party to a case (prosecutor, accused, plaintiff,

defendant, intervenient, added party or any other party) improperly

or unreasonably invoked the proviso. This has resulted in the

Judicial Service Commission having to reappoint judges to avoid

trials being heard de novo. Being conscious of the unsatisfactory

state which resulted in judges at times having to travel long

distances to hear partly heard cases at the expense of severe

hardship being caused to the litigants at their permanent stations,

17

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

the legislature repealed the proviso to section 48 and substituted

thereof, of the following proviso by Judicature (Amendment) Act, No.

27 of 1999.

This amendment removed the right of the parties to civil actions to

demand the resummoning and rehearing of witnesses. Following the

amendment, this right is now confined only to accused persons in

criminal cases.

This amendment also restricted the accuseds rights, which he previously

enjoyed. After the amendment, there is no compulsion on the part of the

Court to resummon and rehear witnesses and commence the trial afresh

when an application is made by the accused; the part in which case the

trial shall commence afresh found in the original proviso was removed.

By removing that portion, the legislature granted the Court the discretion

to decide whether to allow the accuseds application to resummon and

rehear witnesses, based on the facts and circumstances of each

individual case. The use of the term demand in the proviso does not

mean that the Court has no discretion but to comply. According to the

Sinhala version of the proviso, demand means that the accused can

make an application to the Court ( ).

, ( )

, ,

,

.

Blacks Law Dictionary (11th Edition) provides the definition of the verb

demand as follows:

18

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

demand, vb. 1. To claim as ones due; to require; to seek relief. 2. To

summon; to call into court

The above analysis was lucidly explained by Salam J. in Somapala v. The

Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption (supra):

The expression demand as used in the proviso to section 48 has

been often misunderstood and misapplied in the course of legal

proceedings. By the reason of this misunderstanding at times it is

argued that by the use of the expression demand the Legislature

intended or conferred no discretion in the hands of the Judge. The

fact that the Legislature has purposely omitted the phrase in which

case the trial shall commence afresh from the original proviso sheds

enough light on the necessary construction of the amended proviso.

This would necessarily mean that the intention of the legislature is

to do away with the concept of de novo trial even when a demand

is made under the proviso.

Even in the event of a demand being made by the accused as

contemplated by the proviso, yet the court is not bound to comply

with such a demand as if it is mandatory. The ordinary Oxford

dictionary meaning assigned to the word demand is an urgent or

peremptory or authoritative request and nothing more. Quite

interestingly the authoritative version of Act No 27 of 1999 being

Sinhala, in introducing the new proviso uses the expression

as corresponding to the words the

accused may demand. This provides a firm proof that the new

proviso is not only has done away with the requirement of having to

commence proceedings afresh but even the request () to recall

a witness is also placed within the exclusive discretion of the judge.

As such when section 48 is carefully looked at, no difficulty needs

to be encountered in arriving at the conclusion that the trial de novo

19

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

is allowed under the present law only when the Judge makes up his

mind on his own if he thinks fit, to re-summon the witnesses and

commence the proceedings afresh, under the main provision of

section 48.

Failure to record the fact of adoption of evidence

Section 48 does not mandate the judge to formally record the fact of the

adoption of proceedings. Consequently, the failure to record the fact of

adoption of previous proceedings cannot invalidate or vitiate the

proceedings, including the judgment.

For instance, section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code mandates that On

or after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action and before

final judgement, no application for the amendment of any pleadings shall

be allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the

Court, that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such

amendment is not permitted, and on no other ground, and that the party

so applying has not been guilty of laches. There is no similar expression

in section 48 of the Judicature Act.

This view was also upheld by W.L.R. Silva J. in Daniel v. The Attorney

General (CA/164/2007, CA Minutes of 21.07.2010) and Jayasuriya J. in

Chaminda Bandara v. The Attorney General (CA/263/2021, CA Minutes

of 12.01.2018).

In the recent case of Alawaththage Gnanasena alias Banda v. The

Attorney General (CA/HCC/168/2015, CA Minutes of 24.02.2022),

Abayakoon J. also expressed the opinion that entry in the case record

regarding the adoption of evidence is not mandated by the section, and

the norm is for the continuation of the trial:

20

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to adopt the evidence. However,

I find no provision in that regard in section 48 of the judicature Act

as the very purpose of the section is to provide for the continuation

of a trial to avoid undue delay under given circumstances.

It was held in the case of Herath Mudiyanselage Ariyratne Vs.

Republic of Sri Lanka (CA 307/2006 decided on 17-07-2013) that a

transfer of a judge to another station covers by the words other

disability as stated in section 48 of the Judicature Act, hence the

succeeding judge has no disability to continue with a trial.

As discussed earlier, the main part of section 48 provides for a

succeeding judge to re-summon a witness and commence the

proceedings afresh if the judge thinks fit, which is applicable to

either civil or criminal matters at the discretion of the judge.

In the case under consideration, it is clear from the proceedings that

the succeeding High Court Judge has decided to continue with the

case by calling the remaining witnesses as formally adopting the

evidence previously recorded was not a matter that needed the

attention of the Learned High Court Judge, as there was no such

requirement and the provision is for the continuation of the trial.

Even assuming without conceding that the recording of the fact of

adoption of evidence is mandatory, if the accused cannot satisfy the

Court of Appeal that such failure prejudiced the substantive rights of the

accused or occasioned a failure of justice, the Court of Appeal cannot set

aside the judgment in view of the proviso to section 138(1) of the

Constitution.

21

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

Failure to invoke the proviso to section 48

As I have already stated, whether or not the accused is represented by a

lawyer, under the principal part of section 48, the judge decides whether

or not to resummon the witnesses and commence the proceedings afresh.

In the High Court trials on indictments, the accused is necessarily

represented by a lawyer. For the judge to act upon the proviso to section

48, there must be an application by the accused. The failure to make an

application by the accused cannot be attributed to the judge and quash

the entire proceedings, including the judgment pronounced after a

protracted trial.

The process of resummoning witnesses and commencing the trial afresh

might place the accused at a disadvantageous position. When an accused

is represented by a lawyer, the judge should not unnecessarily intrude

into the arena reserved for the lawyer and potentially undermine his

strategy, which could result in injustice rather than justice.

In Ariyaratne v. The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

(CA/307/2006, CA Minutes of 17.07.2013), De Abrew J. emphasised that

the Courts invocation of the proviso to section 48 is contingent upon the

accused making an application to resummon and rehear witnesses.

In Krishnakumar v. Attorney General (supra) at 459, Abayakoon J. stated:

I am of the view that if it was the intention of the accused to re-

summon witnesses, it was up to the accused appellant to make such

a demand, which he has failed to do. In the instant action, the

appellant has not demanded the re-summoning of the witnesses

before the successor of the original trial judge who heard most of the

witnesses including the evidence of PW-01. Without making use of

his right to demand before the successor of the original trial judge,

and after agreeing for the continuation of the trial, before the judge

22

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

who ultimately concluded the trial, the appellant has no basis to

argue that he was denied of a fair trial, hence, the ground of appeal

urged has no merit.

In Alawaththage Gnanasena alias Banda v. The Attorney General (supra),

all the evidence except that of prosecution witness No. 1 was led before

the High Court Judge who delivered the judgment convicting the accused

for murder. The accuseds lawyer remained the same but no application

was made to the succeeding judge to resummon witness No. 1. On

appeal, it was argued that absence of formal adoption of evidence

warrants quashing the conviction and ordering a retrial. Abayakoon J.

rejected this argument:

As provided in the proviso of section 48 of the Judicature Act, as

amended, which is applicable only for criminal prosecutions, if any

demand was made to re-summon PW-01 with acceptable reasoning,

the learned trial judge could have considered the request and an

appropriate order would have been made at his discretion. I find that

no such application has been made.

I am of the view that without making use of the available provision

before the correct forum, which amounts to a waiver of such right,

the appellant is now precluded from arguing at the appeal stage that

the learned succeeding High Court Judge failed to adopt the previous

proceedings and hence, the matter should be sent for a trial de novo.

I find that this is an argument which has the effect of reviving the

section 48 of the Judicature Act to the level before it was amended

by the amendment Act No 27 of 1999, if allowed. This was not the

intention of the legislature in bringing in the amendment to the Act,

as discussed before.

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The concept of a fair trial should not be viewed purely as an abstract or

theoretical concept. Prof. C.G. Weeramantry, An Invitation to the Law,

(1982), under the topic The law in the field and the law in the book states

at page 136:

The traditional attitudes of lawyers, in the application of their legal

knowledge, has been to confine their attention to the black letter

rules or principles appearing between the covers of their law books.

Deeply learned in the contents of these books, they would research

the legal principles involved with the utmost thoroughness, and

apply them to the facts before them. That task accomplished, their

interest in the matter would cease. They would not follow through

into its social impacts the decision they had thus applied, and they

would go on to half a hundred similar cases, applying their book

knowledge to them without any feedback from the field. Indeed

many a modern court still does just that.

In the pursuit of justice, it is imperative to recognise that legal

proceedings are not a mere game of strategy, but rather a sincere

endeavor by society to ensure public safety and uncover the truth. In Rex

v. Barnes [1921] 61 Dominion Law Reports 623, Riddell J. in the

Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario declared at 638:

The administration of our law is not a game in which the cleverer

and more astute is to win, but a serious proceeding by a people in

earnest to discover the actual facts for the sake of public safety, the

interest of the public generally.

This was referred to with approval by a five Judge Bench of the Supreme

Court in Rupasinghe v. Attorney General [1986] 2 Sri LR 329 at 345, and

by Amaratunga J. in the Supreme Court case of Abeysekera v. Attorney

General [2012] 1 Sri LR 60 at 68.

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

Undefended accused

Although in the High Court, the accused is typically provided with legal

representation, in the Magistrates Court, this may not always be the

case. When the accused is undefended, it becomes the responsibility of

the judge to explain to the accused his right to make an application under

the proviso to section 48 of the Judicature Act to ensure a fair trial.

However, it is ultimately the judges discretion to decide whether to allow

or disallow that application based on the unique facts and circumstances

of the case.

As the Supreme Court held in Kiri Mahaththayas case (supra), failure on

the part of the judge to do so itself will not vitiate the conviction unless it

can be demonstrated that such failure caused prejudice to the

substantial rights of the accused or resulted in a failure of justice.

In SC/APPEAL/2/2022, the appellant, Hettiarachchilage Wasantha

Rathna, was undefended when the second Magistrate took over the trial.

The appellant did not make an application to the succeeding Magistrate

in terms of the proviso to section 48 of the Judicature Act to resummon

and rehear witness No. 1 whose evidence had already been led, nor did

the learned Magistrate explain it to the appellant. The learned Magistrate

proceeded with the trial without recording the fact of adoption of

evidence. After trial, the appellant was convicted for the charge (section

345 of the Penal Code) and the High Court affirmed it.

According to Article 13(3) of the Constitution, the right to a fair trial is a

fundamental right.

13(3). Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be

heard, in person or by an attorney-at-law, at a fair trial by a

competent court.

25

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

The concept of the fair trial encompasses the right of the accused to be

informed of his rights.

However, learned counsel for the appellant in SC/APPEAL/2/2022 did

not make submissions on how such failure on the part of the learned

Magistrate caused prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused or

resulted in a failure of justice. On the facts and circumstances of the

case, I cannot conclude that it caused prejudice to the substantial rights

of the accused or resulted in a failure of justice as the demeanour and

deportment of witness No.1 who gave evidence before the first Magistrate

was never in issue.

Conclusion

For the aforesaid reasons, I answer the two questions of law on which

leave to appeal was granted in SC/APPEAL/139/2019 in the negative.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 13.07.2018 is set aside and

the appeal in SC/APPEAL/139/2019 is allowed. The case is remitted to

the Court of Appeal to decide the appeal of the accused-appellant on the

merits.

In SC/APPEAL/2/2022 the only question of law leave to appeal has been

sought from and granted by the High Court is Is formal adoption of

proceedings in criminal trials necessary in view of section 48 of the

Judicature Act? This question has already been answered in the

negative. In addition, the position of the undefended accused was also

considered in the judgment. Hence, the appeal in SC/APPEAL/2/2022 is

dismissed.

In SC/SPL/LA/267/2018 (accused Rajapakse Gedara Nandasena alias

Kirikolla), the two questions of law on which leave has been sought are

the identical two questions of law accepted by this Court in

SC/APPEAL/139/2019. At the argument, learned counsel for the

26

SC/APPEAL/139/2019

accused-appellant-petitioner informed this Court that he is agreeable to

abide by the judgment in SC/APPEAL/139/2019. Hence in

SC/SPL/LA/267/2018, special leave to appeal from the judgment of the

Court of Appeal dated 13.07.2018 is refused and the application is

dismissed.
