"cannot have a direct impact on the maintainability or the outcome of the civil proceedings. In this regard"
"it  is  also  pertinent  to  observe  that  the  decision  to  initiate  and  continue  with  a  prosecution  for  alleged"
"offences  rests  with  the  State  other  than  in  instances  where  criminal  proceedings  are  instituted  by  a"
"private individual whereas initiating proceedings based on civil liability always rests on the party who"
"claims, that a cause of action has arisen based on the conduct of the opposing party. It is also important"
"to note that one of the core differences between the two sets of proceedings is that the main objective of"
"criminal proceedings is punitive in nature whereas civil proceedings are to remedy the wrong caused to a"
"party.  However,  despite  this  marked  difference  in  the  two  sets  of  proceedings,  provision  is  made  in"
"criminal  proceedings  to  grant  compensation  to  victims  too.  Therefore,  the  issue  arises  as  to  whether"
"acceptance of compensation in criminal proceedings should deprive a claimant to have recourse to civil"
"litigation against the same person who paid compensation in the course of criminal proceedings. In my"
"view this issue needs to be considered in the context of facts peculiar to each situation."
