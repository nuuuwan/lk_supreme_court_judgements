"Court fixed this matter for argument on top of the list for 12.02.2024 and 13.02.2024. All"
"parties were heard on these two days. At the conclusion of the hearing, all parties were"
"granted two weeks’ time to file written submissions. The Appellant, 1st Respondent and"
"the 4th Respondent-Respondent have filed written submissions. Court is grateful to these"
"parties for having assisted it by tendering detailed written submissions on time."
"Before proceeding to deal with the merits, I wish to refer to the contention made by the"
"learned President’s Counsel for the 1st Respondent that parties were heard only on the"
"preliminary  objections  and  the  majority  judgment  dismissed  the  application  on  the"
"preliminary objections without going into the merits. An examination of the proceedings"
"before the Court of Appeal and a plain reading of the majority judgment shows the fallacy"
"of this contention."
"The written submissions dated 27.03.2023 filed on behalf of the 1st Respondent states"
"that  they  are  tendered  on  the  Preliminary  Objections  and  the  main  application.  The"
"synopsis of the submissions tendered on behalf of the 1st Respondent dated 04.10.2023"
"states that they are tendered on the entirety of the matters raised in the petition of the"
"Petitioner  with  regard  to  the  main  application,  subsequent  counter  affidavit  of  the"
"Petitioner and the preliminary objections raised on behalf of the 1st Respondent. In fact,"
"the majority judgment after upholding the preliminary objections, went on to state (at"
"page 27) that “[t]he merits of the case also do not warrant the issuance of the Writ prayed"
"for”.  Clearly  the  parties  were  heard  on  both  the  preliminary  objections  as  well  as  the"
"merits  and  the  majority  judgment  considered  the  merits  of  the  application  as  well  in"
"dismissing it."
"Disqualification as Member of Parliament"
"The Appellant contends that the 1st Respondent is disqualified from holding office as a"
"Member of Parliament in terms of Article 91 read with Article 89 of the Constitution."
