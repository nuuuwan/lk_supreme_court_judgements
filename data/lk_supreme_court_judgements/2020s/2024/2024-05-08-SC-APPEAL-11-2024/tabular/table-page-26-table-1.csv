"Such  a  declaration  cannot  in  any  way  surpass  a  subsequent  order  made  by  a  Court  of"

"v. Geetha Samanmalee Kumarasinghe and Others [supra.] Court rejected the contention"
"that the only way to remove a Member of Parliament was by filing an election petition"
"and  that  Article  140  of  the  Constitution  cannot  be  invoked  to  remove  a  Member  of"
"Parliament."
"It must be borne in mind that the Court of Appeal as well as the Supreme Court exercises"
"the judicial power of the People when exercising the jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of"
"the Constitution. In this application, the  Appellant has sought a Writ of Quo Warranto"
"declaring that the 1st Respondent is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and is thus"
"not entitled to hold office as a member of Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic"
"of Sri Lanka."
"When a Court issues  such  a  mandate in  the  nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto, the 1st"

"Gazette No. 2188/46 dated 14.08.2020 as an administrative step insofar as pertaining to"
"the 1st Respondent ceases to be operative."
"I reject the contention that issuing a Writ of Quo Warranto as prayed for in the petition is"
"a futile act."
