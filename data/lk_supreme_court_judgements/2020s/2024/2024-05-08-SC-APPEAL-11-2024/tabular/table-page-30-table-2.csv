"The merits of the case also do not warrant the issuance of the Writ prayed for. As"
"such the Petitioner’s application warrants dismissal.”"
"I have given anxious consideration to this submission of the Appellant and find that there"
"is much merit in it. The majority judgment (from pages 5 to 27) indeed contains 80 parts"
"as alleged by the Appellant, sequentially, which are either a verbatim reproduction or a"
"slight variation (without any acknowledgment of the source) of the Appellant’s petition"
"before the Court of Appeal, the Appellant’s written submissions filed in March 2023 and"
"the 1st Respondent’s written submissions filed in May 2023."
"The only original five paragraphs of the majority judgment by far does not set out the"
"correct principles that govern the issue of a Writ of Quo Warranto."
