"The reference therein to bona fide appears to be an acceptance of the allegation made by"
"the  1st  Respondent  that  the  Appellant  is  motivated  by  political  considerations  and  the"
"application has been made mala fide. I fail to see the relevance of this assertion where"
"the evidence before Court establishes that the 1st Respondent ceased to be a citizen of Sri"
"Lanka upon acquiring British citizenship and failed to resume the status of citizen of Sri"
"Lanka according to law. She is thereby disqualified to be a Member of Parliament by the"
"Constitution."
"Franchise is a fundamental right of all citizens of Sri Lanka. Members of Parliament are"
"appointed by the  exercise of the franchise of the People. Thereafter, they  exercise the"
"legislative power of the People. The Constitution itself provides for the qualifications a"
"person  must  have  to  become  a  Member  of  Parliament.  Where  a  person  so  elected  is"
"disqualified of holding such office, any citizen of the country can invoke the jurisdiction of"
"the Court of Appeal seeking a Writ of Quo Warranto calling upon the holder to show the"
"authority under which he claims to hold such office."
"For  all  the  reasons  more  fully  set  out  above,  the  majority  judgment  erred  in  law  in"
"upholding  the  three  preliminary  objections  and  refusing  the  relief  prayed  for  by  the"
"Appellant  on  the  merits.  The  minority  judgment  granted  the  relief  prayed  for  by  the"
"Appellant without a consideration of the three preliminary objections raised on behalf of"
"the 1st Respondent."
"All the questions of law are answered in the affirmative."
"Both the majority and minority judgments dated 31.10.2023 are hereby set aside."
"I issue a Writ of Quo Warranto declaring that the 1st Respondent is disqualified to be a"
"Member of Parliament and is thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament"
"of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."
