"I am constrained to address another point relied on by the Appellant, which has caused"
"Court great concern. The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that:"
"(a) The entire majority judgment, including the parts which are seemingly an analysis"
"of the case before us, is directly from the written submission of the 1st Respondent"
"and, accordingly, with no analysis in Law;"
"(b) The  parts  of  the  majority  judgment  which  is  a  reproduction  of  the  said  written"
"submissions  of  the  1st  Respondent  is  a  blatant  and  manifest  misapplication  and"
"misconstruction of the law pertaining to a Writ of Quo Warranto."
"In elaborating on this allegation, the Appellant contended that the content of the majority"
"judgment (from pages 5 to 27) comprises, sequentially, a verbatim reproduction of the"
"Appellant’s petition before the Court of Appeal, the Appellant’s written submissions filed"
"in March 2023 and the 1st Respondent’s written submissions filed in May 2023."
"In  order  to  buttress  this  submission,  the  Appellant  has  with  his  written  submissions"
"tendered  a  table  marked  “X5”  setting  out  each  paragraph  of  the  judgment  and  the"
"corresponding paragraphs of the  petition or the written submissions.  According to this"
"chart, there are 80 such places in the majority judgment."
"According to the Appellant the only original parts of the majority judgment are found from"
"the 3rd paragraph on page 26 of the judgment, a total of five paragraphs. According to the"
"Appellant, the original paragraphs are as follows:"
"“The conditions required to apply to the court to issue a Writ is restricted in several"
"ways. There is no bar or restriction on who can apply. Any person can apply as long"
"as  their  fundamental  or  any  other  legal  right  is  being  breached.  In  cases  where"
"there is no breach of right, a question of public interest must arise with respect to"
"the  application.  It  should  not  be  made  for  the  sake  of  certain  hidden  political"
"struggle or undercurrent. The applicant should act in public interest, and not expect"
