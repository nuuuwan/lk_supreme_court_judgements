"particular, the consumer’s state of mind:"
"(1) where a misrepresentation is honest and  reasonable, the insurer must pay  the"
"claim. The applicant is expected to exercise the standard of care of a reasonable"
"consumer, bearing in mind a range of factors, such as the type of policy and the"
"clarity of the question. The test does not take into account the individual’s own"
"subjective  circumstances  (such  as  knowledge  of  English),  unless  these  were,  or"
"ought to have been, known by the insurer;"
"(2) if, when answering questions posed by an insurer, a consumer answers carelessly,"
"the  Act  provides  that  the  insurer  may  have  a  remedy  according  to  whether  it"
"would  have  entered  into  the  contract  on  different  terms.  If  it  would  not  have"
"entered into the contract at all, it may  refuse all claims but it must return the"
"premiums paid. If it would have entered into the contract on different terms, the"
"contract may be taken to include those different terms. For example, if the insurer"
"would have added an exclusion clause, the insurer need not pay claims which fall"
"within the exclusion but must pay all other claims. If the premium would have"
"been higher, the insurer must pay a proportion of the claim; and"
"(3) if a consumer makes a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation, the Act permits"
"the insurer to avoid the policy and treat the contract as if it never existed and"
"refuse all claims. The insurer would also be entitled to retain the premium, unless"
"there was a good reason why the premium should be returned.”14"
