"38.  The Respondent submitted that the test for determining what constitutes a ‘material fact’"
"to be whether a prudent insurer might be influenced in his judgment if he knew of such"
"fact and not what the Insured thinks as to what might be material, relying on the decision"
"of the House of Lords in Pan Atlantic Insurance Case. This is indeed accurate insofar as"
"this case is concerned, for this is one element of the test of materiality set out in the law"
"prior to the reforms discussed hereinabove.21 The other element of the test of materiality"
"is the requirement of actual inducement."
