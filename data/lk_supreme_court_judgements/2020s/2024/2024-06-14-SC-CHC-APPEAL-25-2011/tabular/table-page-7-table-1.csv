"ENGLISH REFORMS IN BRIEF: WHAT IS NEW?",""
"17.  The Amendments in consumer insurance law were brought about following a joint report",""
"","by  the  Law  Commission  of  England  &  Wales  and  the  Scottish  Law  Commission  titled"
"Consumer Insurance Law: Pre-Contract Disclosure and Misrepresentation.8",""
"18.  As  the  Law  Commissions  noted,  the  law  at  the  time  was  somewhat  complex  and",""
"","confusing.  It  was  overly  harsh,  especially  on  the  insured,  and  was  unsuited  to  the"
"","consumer market of the twenty-first century.9 The proposals were made to mitigate this"
"harshness and bring about clarity and certainty.",""
"19.  The  harshness 
is  perfectly","illustrated  by  cases  such  as  Lambert  v.  Co-operative"
"","Insurance Society.10 In this, Mrs. Lambert insured her family jewellery under an ‘all-risk’"
"","insurance.  When  she  signed  the  proposal  form,  she  did  not  disclose  her  husband’s"
"","previous conviction for receiving stolen cigarettes. She was never asked for these details"
"","by the insurer. When she claimed for the lost jewellery, the insurer avoided the policy on"
"","the basis of failure to disclose. The conviction was material, as it would have influenced"
"","a  prudent  insurer.  It  mattered  not  that  Mrs.  Lambert,  or  a  reasonable  person  in  her"
"position, would not have realised its materiality.",""
"20.  The new reforms to English law in regard to the presentation of risk are reflected in two",""
"","distinct, yet related, regimes. Governing consumer insurance is the Consumer Insurance"
"","(Disclosure and Representation) Act 2012, which received Royal Assent on 8th March 2012"
"8 LAW COM No 319; SCOT LAW COM No 219",""
