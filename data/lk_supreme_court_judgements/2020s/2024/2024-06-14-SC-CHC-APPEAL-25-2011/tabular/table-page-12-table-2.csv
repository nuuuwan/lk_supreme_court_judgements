"Pre-Reform English Law and the Sri Lankan Application"
"28.  As observed by Lord Mansfield in the seminal case of Carter v. Boehm,15"
"“… Insurance is a contract of speculation. The special facts, upon which the contingent"
"change is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only:"
"the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he"
"does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the under-writer"
"into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the"
"risque, as if it did not exist."
"The  keeping  back  such  circumstance  is  a  fraud,  and  therefore  the  policy  is  void."
"Although the suppression should happen through mistake, without any fraudulent"
"intention; yet still the under-writer is deceived, and the policy is void; because the"
"risque run is really different from the risque understood and intended to be run, at"
"the time of the agreement."
