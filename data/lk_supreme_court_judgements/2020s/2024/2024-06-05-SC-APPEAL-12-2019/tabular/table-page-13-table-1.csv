"exercised having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity and to all the"
"circumstances."
"The  conclusions  reached  in  the  above  case  confirmed  the  established  legal  principle"
"that a corporate entity is distinct from its members and its directors. It was determined"
"that  the  offence  outlined  in  Section  51(1)  does  not  require  the  demonstration  of  any"
"specific mens rea or culpable state of mind. Furthermore, it held that, even in situations"
"where a specific state of mind is required, common law has developed the doctrine of"
"'identification,' which assigns criminal liability directly to the company, regardless of"
"whether the acts or omissions that constituted a violation of the law were carried out by"
"its employees or agents."
"The Court acknowledged Section 51(3) of the Exchange Control Act, which extends"
"liability to directors or officials of a corporate body unless they can demonstrate that"
"the  offence  occurred  without  their  knowledge  or  cooperation,  and  that  they  took  all"
"reasonable steps to prevent it. However, in the said case where only the company was"
"charged, the mental state of a director or official was ruled to be irrelevant as per the"
"provision."
