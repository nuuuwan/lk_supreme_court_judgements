"The above amendment expands the scope of liability to include collective or corporate"
"entities. Specifically, it stipulates that when such offences are committed by a body of"
"persons (whether a corporate body, a firm, or an unincorporated body), every director,"
"manager, secretary, partner, or member of that entity can be held accountable."
"Therefore, as expressly defined in the said Acts aforementioned, we recommend that"
"suitable  amendments  be  brought  to  the  existing  NWSDB  Act,  where  the  legislation"
"creating the offence under Section 31 of the Act, makes express provisions to clearly"
"define and distinguish  liability of natural persons and  that of body of persons in the"
"offence of Section 31 of the NWSDB Act."
"Accordingly, I answer the question of law on which leave to appeal has been granted"
"in the affirmative."
"For these reasons, this Appeal of the Accused-Petitioners are allowed, the Judgements"
"of the Court of Appeal, the High Court and that of the Magistrateâ€™s Court are set aside."
"The Amended Plaint dated 17/01/2012 stands quashed. No order is made for costs."
