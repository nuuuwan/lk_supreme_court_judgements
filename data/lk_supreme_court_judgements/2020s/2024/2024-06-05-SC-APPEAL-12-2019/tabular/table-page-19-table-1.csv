"indicating an active role and intent in the offence by its directors, can any individual be"
"prosecuted  as  the  principal  offender  for  the  “actus  reus”  of  affixing  or  causing  the"
"affixing  of  any  pipe  or  apparatus  to  the  water  system  provided  by  the  Board  for"
"conveyance, reception, or control of water?"
"It is asserted that the Amended charge sheet dated 17/01/2012 must consist of separate"
"charges attributing criminal liability on the part of Royal Hospitals (Pvt.) Ltd. and its"
"directors since both entities have a legal personality that is separate and distinct from"
"each other. Therefore, in terms of Section 164, 165 (1) and (3) of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act, the failure to frame separate  charges on criminal liability against the"
"directors and the body of persons, the failure to define or identify an offender in the"
"commission of the offence as charged, and in the absence of a prima facie case against"
"one or more persons mentioned above, (an individual or a body of persons), makes the"
"amended  charge  sheet  dated  17/01/2012,  filed  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  Colombo,"
"misconceived in law."
"As discussed earlier, there are several Acts where the legislation creating the offence"
"has expressly and validly made provisions for criminal liability on the part of a body of"
"persons,  since  such  body  has  a  legal  personality  that  is  separate  from  its  members."
"Apart from the EPF Act, (as observed earlier in this Judgment) several other Acts have"
"provided for separate criminal liability dealing with body of persons and individuals,"
"such as;"
"1.  Food Act No. 26 of 1980 - (Section 27)"
"2.  Employees Trust Fund Act No. 46 of 1980 – [Section 40]"
"3.  Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 – [Section 81]"
"4.  Social Security Contribution Levey Act No. 25 of 2022 – [Section 43(2)]"
"5.  Computer Crime Act No. 24 of 2007 – [Section 30]"
"6.  Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 – [Section 25]"
"7.  Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Act No. 2of 1996 – [Section 50]"
"8.  National Gem and Jewelry Authority Act No. 50 of 1993 – [Section 51 (3)]"
