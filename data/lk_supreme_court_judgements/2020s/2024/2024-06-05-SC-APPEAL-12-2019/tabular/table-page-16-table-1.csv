"In M.V. Javali vs. Mahajan Borewell & Co. and Others13: The discussion was on legal"
"interpretations and principles related to holding individuals and companies accountable"
"for certain offences. It distinguishes between individuals (such as directors, managers,"
"secretaries,  or  other  officers)  who  can  be  held  vicariously  liable  for  an  offence"
"committed by a company and the company itself."
"In the amended charge sheet dated 17/01/2012, all accused (Royal Hospitals (Pvt) Ltd."
"and all its directors) charged with the commission of the offence are treated as principal"
"offenders."
"As noted, before, Section 40 of the EPF Act has made express provisions attributing"
"liability on the part of a body of persons which has a legal personality that is separate"
"from a director, partner, or officer. Section 31 of the NWRDB Act has made no such"
"express  provision  separate  and  distinguishable  from  that  of  a  natural  person  and  a"
"corporate entity. Then the question arises as to the transfer of liability between entities"
"that are natural persons and corporate entities."
"Liability of a body of persons will depend on whether the offence is one of which there"
"is  vicarious  liability  or  if  there  is  not,  and  whether  the  prohibited  act  by  the  natural"
"person  can  be  attributed  to  the  body  of  persons.  “Where  vicarious  liability  exists  a"
"company will have imputed to it the acts and state of mind of those of its directors and"
"managers who represent its “directing mind and will.” (Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. vs."
"Nattrass14)"
"It is also important to distinguish between the law which determines the offences on"
"which  a  corporation  may  be  convicted  and  the  liability  of  such  corporation  for  an"
"offence on which it can be convicted. As discussed before companies are culpable as"
"any living person and can be prosecuted and sentenced."
