"I  am  mindful  that  Parliament  has  power,  pursuant  to  Article  75  of  the  Constitution,  to"
"make laws, including laws having retrospective effect. In fact, recently it passed the Civil"
"Procedure  Code  (Amendment)  Act  No.  17  of  2022  where  Section  3  provides  for  the"
"retrospective  application  of  the  amendments  by  the  use  of  the  words  “case  or  appeal"
"pending on the date of coming into operation of this Act”. No such intention is reflected"
"in the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 5 of 2022. Accordingly, the amendment"
"does not have any retrospective application."
"For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that leave to appeal must be refused. Application is"
"dismissed. Parties shall bear their costs."
