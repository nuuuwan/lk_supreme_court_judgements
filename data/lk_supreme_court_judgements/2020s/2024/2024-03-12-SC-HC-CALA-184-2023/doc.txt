Janak De Silva, J.

This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Civil Appellate High

Court of the Central Province (Holden in Kandy) (Civil Appellate High Court) dated

17.03.2023 by which leave to appeal against the order of the learned District Judge of

Nawalapitiya dated 16.12.2021 was dismissed.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner (Petitioner) instituted action against the

Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) seeking a declaration of

title to the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint, and an order of eviction

against the Respondent and all persons claiming under him.

The Petitioner as well as his registered Attorney-at-Law were absent when the matter was

taken up for further trial on 24.09.2020. Hence, the action was dismissed.

The Petitioner made an application in terms of Section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure Code

to have the dismissal set aside. After inquiry, the learned District Judge refused to set aside

the judgment entered upon the default of the Petitioner.

Aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge, the Petitioner filed a leave to

appeal application in the Civil Appellate High Court. The Respondent raised a preliminary

objection that the application was misconceived in law and that the Petitioner should have

come by way of final appeal. This was upheld by the Civil Appellate High Court and the

Petitioner has filed this leave to appeal application against the said judgment.

The question that arises for determination is whether a party aggrieved by a default

judgment must come by way of appeal or leave to appeal.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the proper application is a leave to

appeal application and relied on the judgment of S.R. Chettiar and Others v. S.N. Chettiar

[(2011) BALR 25, (2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 70] and Dona Padma Priyanthi Senanayake v. H.G.

Chamika Jayantha [(2017) BALR 74]. There this Court held that an appeal could be filed

in respect of judgments or orders which are final. In respect of other orders, leave to

appeal should be first obtained. It was further held, that in order to decide whether an

order is a final judgment or not, the proper approach is to apply the application approach

test and not the order approach test which was applied earlier.

Relying on the above authorities, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that

the proper application was a leave to appeal application which was challenged by the

learned Counsel for the Respondent who relied on the decisions in Wijeyanayake v.

Wijeyanayake [III Srikanthas Law Reports 28] and A.S. Sangarapillai & Bros. v.

Kathiravelu [II Sriskanthas Law Reports 99] where it was held that the proper application

was a final appeal.

Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

The order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon default

shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon the facts and specifying the

grounds upon which it is made, and shall be liable to an appeal to the Court of

Appeal.

This provision was examined by a fuller bench of this Court in Barbara Iranganie De Silva

v. Hewa Waduge Indralatha [(2017) BALR 68] and it was held that the application

approach test enunciated in S.R. Chettiar and Others v. S.N. Chettiar (supra.) and Dona

Padma Priyanthi Senanayake v. H.G. Chamika Jayantha (supra.) have no application to

an application made pursuant to Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. It was held

that Section 88(2) provides for a special procedure and that Section 754(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code has no application to such an application. Accordingly, Court concluded

that a party aggrieved by a judgment entered upon default must file an appeal pursuant

to Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

I am in respectful agreement with the decision in Barbara Iranganie De Silva v. Hewa

Waduge Indralatha (supra.). Hence, the leave to appeal application made by the

Petitioner is misconceived in law. The Civil Appellate High Court was correct in dismissing

the application on the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent. Accordingly, leave

to appeal must be refused in this application.

Before parting, I must make reference to the fact that the learned Counsel for the

Respondent assisted Court by drawing our attention to the amendment made to Section

88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code by Act No. 5 of 2022 which now reads as follows:

The order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon default

shall accompany the facts upon which it is adjudicated and specify the grounds

upon which it is made, and shall be liable to an appeal to the relevant High Court

Page 6 of 6

established by Article 154P of the Constitution, with leave first had and obtained

from such High Court.

Accordingly, the position now is that a party aggrieved by a judgment entered upon

default must file a leave to appeal application pursuant to Section 88(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

The Petitioner filed the appeal before the Civil Appellate High Court on 03.01.2022. The

Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2022 became law on 17.02.2022.

I am mindful that Parliament has power, pursuant to Article 75 of the Constitution, to

make laws, including laws having retrospective effect. In fact, recently it passed the Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2022 where Section 3 provides for the

retrospective application of the amendments by the use of the words case or appeal

pending on the date of coming into operation of this Act. No such intention is reflected

in the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 5 of 2022. Accordingly, the amendment

does not have any retrospective application.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that leave to appeal must be refused. Application is

dismissed. Parties shall bear their costs.
