ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 17-01-2024.

P. PADMAN SURASENA J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Intervenient

Petitioner-Appellant, submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner-

Respondent-Respondents, and the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor

General appearing for the 1st -3rd Respondent- Respondent-Respondents.

The Petitioner- Respondent- Respondents have filed the Writ Application relevant

to this case in the Court of Appeal against the Respondent- Respondent-

Respondents.

During the pendency of the said Application before the Court of Appeal, the

Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant had sought to intervene as a party to the said

Writ Application.

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents had objected to the said application for

intervention made by the intervened Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal.

Thereafter, a divisional bench of the Court of Appeal, having considered the

submissions made by the learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner-

Respondent-Respondents as well as the submissions made by the learned

Counsel who appeared for the Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant, by its order

dated 22-11-2011, had refused the application of the Intervenient Petitioner-

Appellant to intervene as a party to the said Writ Application.

[SC APPEAL 166/2012] Page 8 of 10

Being aggrieved by the said decision dated 22-11-2011 pronounced by the Court

of Appeal, the intervenient Petitioner- Appellant has filed this appeal.

When the case was taken up for argument in this Court today, the learned

Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents informed this

Court that the Petitioner- Respondent- Respondents would no longer maintain

the objection raised against the intervention sought by the intervenient

Petitioner- Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner- Respondent- Respondents then

proceeded to inform us that the intervention sought by the Intervenient

Petitioner- Appellant- can be allowed and the order dated 22-11-2021

pronounced by the Court to Appeal refusing permission for the Intervenient

Petitioner- Appellant to intervene as a party can be pro-forma set-aside.

Mr. Ganesharajan appearing for the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents also

consented to take the proposed course of action in this appeal by this Court.

Mr. Vikum De Abrew, PC, ASG brings to the notice of this Court that the 1st - 3rd

Respondent- Respondent-Respondents have not filed written submissions to

resist the application for intervention made by the Intervenient Petitioner-

Appellant.

The Order dated 22-11-2021 pronounced by the Court of Appeal does not show

that the 1st - 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondents have resisted the

application made by the Intervenient Petitioner- Appellant for intervention as a

party in the Court of Appeal.

The order dated 22-11-2021 pronounced by the Court of Appeal which is the

order impugned in this appeal, is just an order refusing permission for the

Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant for Intervention. We have also taken into

consideration that this order has been made by the Court of Appeal on 22-11-

2021.

[SC APPEAL 166/2012] Page 9 of 10

This Court was told by the learned Counsel that the argument of the Writ

Application is yet to be taken up before the Court of Appeal.

Indeed, that is the primary reason as to why Mr. Ganesharajan had decided to

consent for the application for the intervention made by the Intervenient

Petitioner-Appellant. This was done with a view to facilitate the speedy disposal

of the relevant Writ Application pending for a long time in the Court of Appeal.

We note that when this case came up before this Court on 07-07-2023, the

learned counsel for the Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant as well as the learned

counsel for the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents had informed this Court that

they would inform this position to the Court of Appeal and have the matter

relating to the application for intervention settled in the Court of Appeal.

However, today Mr. Ganesharajan brought to our notice, the journal entry dated

21-07-2020 made by the Court of Appeal in the relevant Writ Application. The

said journal entry also shows that the learned counsel appearing for the parties

had undertaken in the Court of Appeal to inform this settlement to this Court.

In view of the above, we are also of the view that this is the best course of action

to be taken in this case at this stage.

Thus, with the concurrence of the learned Counsel for the Intervenient

Petitioner-Appellant and the learned Counsel for the Petitioner-Respondent-

Respondents, we pro forma set aside the order dated 22-11-2021 pronounced by

the Court of Appeal. The Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant is allowed to intervene

as a Respondent to the relevant Writ Application.

Mr. Ganesharajan informs this Court that he has no objection for the

Intervenient Petitioner-Appellant filing a statement of objections in the Court of

Appeal in the relevant Writ Application.
