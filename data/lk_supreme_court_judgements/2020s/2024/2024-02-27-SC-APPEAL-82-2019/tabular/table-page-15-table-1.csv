"requirement is not fulfilled by the Appellant in adducing evidence on alibi."
"The Court stated thus;"

"The trial Court, although used the terms such as “m%n, ielhla” and “"
"ielhla u;= lsrsug  iu;a ù  fkdue;” in translating the quoted text from the"
"judgments,  unwittingly 
left  room  for  the  Appellant  to  contend  that  a"
"burden was imposed.  What the Court really expected from the Appellant"
"was to place sufficient evidence which might create a reasonable doubt in"
"the prosecution case. The process of reasoning adopted by the Court, in to"
"finding 
the  Appellant 
guilty 
to 
the 
1st 
count, 
negates 
any 
such"
"apprehensions 
that 
it 
imposed 
a 
burden 
on 
him. 
The 
relevant"
"pronouncement is reproduced below;"

"Having carefully perused the impugned judgment of the trial Court,"
"it  is  my  considered  view  that  it  had  not  imposed  any  burden  on  the"
"Appellant  on  his  alibi  and  rightly  applied  the  applicable  burden  of  proof"
"beyond  reasonable  doubt  on  the  prosecution  to  prove 
its  case  before"
"arriving at the verdict of guilty."
