"S.C. Appeal  No.82/2019"
"After perusing the judgment of the trial Court, for the reasons given"
"below, I am of the view that the pronouncements reproduced above were"
"made regarding  nature of the evidence presented by the Appellant on his"
"alibi."
"When  the  Appellant  put  across  his  alibi  to  the  virtual  complainant,"
"he  merely  suggested  that  he  was  nowhere  near  the  place  of  the  alleged"
"incident.  The  Appellant  did  not 
suggest 
to  any  of 
the  prosecution"
"witnesses that he remained within his place of work, Ocean Colombo Hotel"
"premises, during the time  he was said to have seen near the KFC. Only in"
"his examination in chief did the Appellant disclose for the first time where"
"he was during the relevant time."
"The  Appellant  also  called  the  Human  Resource  Manager  of  Ocean"
"Colombo  Hotel,  Madhurangi  Fernando, 
to  give  evidence  on  his  behalf."
"During  her  evidence,  the  witness  stated  that  the  registers  maintained  at"
"Ocean Colombo Hotel indicate that  the Appellant had reported to work on"
"02.08.2014  at  8.00  a.m.  and  left  at  8.00  p.m.    She  tendered  a  copy  of  an"
"attendance  sheet  marked  as  V2,  into  which  the  Appellant  himself  had"
"entered  the  said  details.    She  further  stated  that  if  an  employee  were  to"
"leave the Hotel during office hours, he could do so only after informing the"
"security  post 
located  at 
the  rear  entrance,  being 
the  only  exit  point"
"available for employees other than the main entrance."
"The  prosecution,  during 
its 
cross 
examination  of 
the  defence"
"witness, elicited that she had joined the said establishment at a later point"
"of  time  and  could  only  state  in  evidence  what  the  documents  indicate."
"Importantly,  she  conceded  that  any  employee  could  leave  the  workplace"
