thereupon  concurred  with 
the  conclusion"
"reached by the trial Court that the Appellant failed to substantiate his alibi."
"Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  heavily  relied  on  the  wording"
"used by the trial Court as well as the appellate Court, in order to impress"
"upon  this  Court  that  in  fact  there  was  an  undue  burden  imposed  by  the"
"Courts below. He sought to buttress the said contention by stating that he"
"was  convicted  by  the  trial  Court    due  to  his  failure  to  raise  a  reasonable"
"doubt and that too by substantiating his alibi."
"The  principles  of  law  that  are  applicable  in  an  instance  where  an"
"accused  takes  up  an  alibi  had  been 
laid  down  by  superior  Courts 
in"
"multiple 
judicial  pronouncements.  Suffice 
to  quote  one  such 
instance,"
"where  a  divisional  bench  of  this  Court  in  Mannar  Mannan  v  Republic  of"
"Sri Lanka (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 280, held (at p. 285 ) that “… it was sufficient for"
"the appellant to have raised a  reasonable doubt as to the truth  of the case for the"
"prosecution, namely that it was the appellant who shot and caused the death of the"
"deceased; that there was no burden whatsoever on the appellant to prove his denial"
""" or to prove that he was elsewhere at the time of the shooting”."
"Despite  clear  pronouncements  made  by  the  Courts  of  Record  as  to"
"the applicable legal principles, the determinations made by trial Courts on"
"plea of alibi are regularly challenged in appeal. As evident from the instant"
"appeal,  the  primary  reason  for  challenging  the  determination  of  the  trial"
"Court 
is  not 
its  application  of 
those  principles 
to 
the  given  set  of"
"circumstances but the way in which the trial Court described its process of"
"reasoning by using certain terminology. The Appellant before us too relies"
"on such references in support of his contention of imposition of a burden."
