"S.C. Appeal  No.82/2019"
"during  lunch  break.  She  was  unable  to state  from  the  records  whether  or"
"not the Appellant had left the premises during daytime on 02.08.2019."
"It appears that the purpose of calling the Human Resource Manager"
"was to support the fact that the Appellant did report to work on 02.08.2019"
"and left his workplace only at 8.00 p.m. However, the witness conceded to"
"the  suggestion  by 
the  prosecution 
that  she 
is  unable 
to  provide  any"
"evidence  whether  the  Appellant  remained  within    his  workplace  during"
"12.30 p.m. to 1.00 p.m."
"Interestingly,  the  efforts  made  by  the  Appellant  in  his  evidence  to"
"emphasise  that  it  is  a  near  impossibility  to  leave  his  workplace  during"
"office  hours  were  botched  by  his  own  witness,  Madhurangi,  when  she"
"conceded to the position suggested by the prosecution that one could leave"
"workplace  during  office  hours  without    formally  applying  for  leave.  She,"
"however,  offered  a  clarification  that  one  could  go  out  in  like  manner  in"
"instances such as to buy a packet of lunch."
"On  the  other  hand,  the  prosecution  presented  clear  unambiguous"
"evidence that the incident had taken place around 12.30 p.m. or 1.00 p.m."
"near KFC  Wellawatta. The Appellant himself conceded that there was only"
"a  distance  of  two  kilometres  from  his  workplace  to  the  place  of 
the"
"incident.  He was also content with merely stating to Court that if needed"
"his position could be verified by viewing CCTV footage and also with his"
"sectional head."
"The  prosecution 
that  must  discharge 
its  burden  of  proof, 
in"
"establishing  a  criminal  charge  by  which 
it  alleged  the  Appellant  had"
"committed an offence. Of the many factors the prosecution must establish"
