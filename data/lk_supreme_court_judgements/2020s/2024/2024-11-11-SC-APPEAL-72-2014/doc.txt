A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[1] The Petitioner-Appellant filed this Writ Application against the 1st to 4th

Respondents-Respondents praying inter-alia, to the grant of a writ of certiorari to

quash the notice to quit (marked X36) issued by the 2nd Respondent, directing the

Petitioner to vacate the land depicted in Plan No. 4356 N marked X1, and to the

grant of a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd Respondent to transfer the land bearing

assessment No. 325, Bambarakele, Nuwara Eliya, morefully depicted in the said

Plan No. 4356 N, to the Petitioner.

[2] This application was filed on the basis that the land in dispute was possessed and

cultivated by the parents of the Petitioner since 1970, which was once part of

Oliphant Estate, Nuwara Eliya. It is submitted that the Petitioner continued to

possess and cultivate the said land for well over 40 years.

[3] The Petitioner submits that the 2nd Respondent acting in terms of Section 3 of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, has acted arbitrarily and

unreasonably in the issuance of the notice to quit, which tantamount to an abuse of

statutory process.

[4] The Petitioner supports the above position inter alia, with the following marked

documents, attached to his Application to the Court of Appeal dated 27/01/2012.

I. The 3rd Respondents letter dated 26/08/1996, addressed to the Secretary

Ministry of Plantation Industries and copied to the Petitioner, informing that

steps would be taken by the Land Reform Commission to release the said

land to the Petitioner, marked X20.

P a g e 6 | 8

II. The 3rd Respondents letter dated 12/05/1997, requesting the Petitioner to

prepare a private survey plan depicting the land in question, following the

rules set out in the aforementioned letter, marked X22.

III. The 1st Respondents letter dated 02/08/2010, requesting the Petitioner to pay

Rs. 1,138,561.00 as consideration for 15 perches of the disputed land and to

make the said payment before 15/08/2010, marked X33.

IV. Letter dated 25/01/1996 by the Secretary, Ministry of Plantation Industries

to the Land Reform Commission stating that the land in dispute does not fall

within the property owned by Oliphant Estate and therefore, to inquire into

this issue and to find out whether the said land is owned by the Land Reform

Commission and if so, to take necessary steps to consider the request made

by the Petitioner, marked X14.

V. Letter dated 04/04/1996 by the Secretary, Ministry of Plantation Industries

to the Land Reform Commission requesting to transfer the land in dispute to

the Petitioner, with a copy to the Petitioner, marked X19.

[5] The Court of Appeal by its Judgment dated 08/02/2012, having acknowledged

communications between the Petitioner and the Respondents, and the document

marked X22, held that, No steps were taken to alienate the said land to the

Petitioner.

[6] Accordingly, on the basis that the Petitioner has not established any ground to

quash the said quit notice the Court dismissed the Application without the issuance

of notice on the Respondents.

[7] The Petitioner by Application dated 03/09/2012, is before this Court, primarily to

have the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and for a direction given to

P a g e 7 | 8

the Court of Appeal to determine this matter with notice of this Application to the

1st to 4th Respondents named above.

[8] When this matter was taken up for hearing before this Court, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner, submitted that when the Land Reform Commission had

decided to alienate the land in dispute to the Petitioner, the 2nd Respondents

arbitrary decision to send the notice to quit (X36), was in violation of the principles

of natural justice and is in breach of the Petitioners legitimate expectations of the

land being alienated to him.

[9] We have perused the documents attached to this Application, and specially the

abovementioned documents relied upon by the Petitioner in support his legitimate

expectations arising in the facts and circumstances of this case.

[10] However, the Court of Appeal has based its decision to refuse issuance of notice on

the Respondents solely on the document marked X22 only. This is clearly reflected

in its order dated 08/02/2012. The said order also clearly reveals that the Court of

Appeal has failed to take into consideration any other document other than X22. In

our view Court of Appeal should have considered the other documents as well.

[11] We are of the view that the Court of Appeal should have investigated whether the

communications between the Petitioner, the Secretary, Ministry of Plantation

Industries, and the Land Reform Commission, in more detail, after issuing notices

on the Respondents.

[12] Accordingly, we set aside the Judgment dated 08/02/2012 since there is a prima

facie case to be looked into, we direct the Court of Appeal to issue notice on the 1st

to 4th Respondents and have an early date for hearing, in order to dispose of this

application.

[13] Appeal allowed; we make no order for costs.
