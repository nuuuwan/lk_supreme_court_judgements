"","the Court of Appeal to determine this matter with notice of this Application to the"
"","1st to 4th Respondents named above."
"[8]","When this matter was taken up for hearing before this Court, the learned President’s"
"","Counsel for the Petitioner, submitted that when the Land Reform Commission had"
"","decided  to  alienate  the  land  in  dispute  to  the  Petitioner,  the  2nd  Respondent’s"
"","arbitrary decision to send the notice to quit (X36), was in violation of the principles"
"","of natural justice and is in breach of the Petitioners legitimate expectations of the"
"","land being alienated to him."
"[9]","We  have  perused  the  documents  attached  to  this  Application,  and  specially  the"
"","abovementioned documents relied upon by the Petitioner in support his legitimate"
"","expectations arising in the facts and circumstances of this case."
"[10]","However, the Court of Appeal has based its decision to refuse issuance of notice on"
"","the Respondents solely on the document marked ‘X22’ only. This is clearly reflected"
"","in its order dated 08/02/2012. The said order also clearly reveals that the Court of"
"","Appeal has failed to take into consideration any other document other than X22. In"
"","our view Court of Appeal should have considered the other documents as well."
"[11]","We are of the view that the Court of Appeal should have investigated whether the"
"","communications  between 
the  Petitioner, 
the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Plantation"
"","Industries, and the Land Reform Commission, in more detail, after issuing notices"
"","on the Respondents."
"[12]","Accordingly,  we  set  aside  the  Judgment  dated  08/02/2012  since  there  is  a  prima"
"","facie case to be looked into, we direct the Court of Appeal to issue notice on the 1st"
"","to 4th Respondents and have an early date for hearing, in order to dispose of this"
"","application."
