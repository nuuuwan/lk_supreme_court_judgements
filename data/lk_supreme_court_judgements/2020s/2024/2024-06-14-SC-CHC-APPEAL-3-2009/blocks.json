The order was placed and confirmed by the letter marked [P-1]. Although the defendant has got the goods released, the defendant has failed to pay the monies due. Following this, the plaintiff filed action in the Commercial High Court of Colombo to recover the total amount of monies due from the defendant. 3. The defendant in its answer filed in the District Court, while denying the claim, submitted that, it could not get the goods released on time as the plaintiff had failed to send the goods on D.A. (Documents against acceptance) terms as agreed. The defendant\u2019s position was that the said delay caused him to pay heavy demurrage and that the goods were not in good order or condition. 4. At the beginning of the trial, the defendant moved Court that the issue raised with regard to prescription be answered as a preliminary issue. The learned High Court Judge after considering the submissions by both the parties answered the said preliminary issue in favor of the plaintiff stating that the action was not prescribed. 5. After trial, the learned High Court Judge, by his judgement dated 05.11.2008, while answering the issues in favor of the plaintiff, held in favor of the plaintiff. 6. Being aggrieved by the decision of the learned High Court Judge, the instant appeal was preferred by the defendant to this Court against the said judgment of the Commercial High Court. 7. At the hearing of this appeal, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the defendant submitted that, the reason for the delay in getting the goods cleared was due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to send the required papers to the bank on D.A. terms.",

However, the witness for the defendant U.G Dayananda, giving evidence in the High Court on 05.09.2007 has admitted that they cleared and accepted the goods from the harbor on 13.01.1997. He also admitted that the entire consignment came to the Colombo harbor by 22.12.1996. 14. The witness has further testified that they never rejected the goods (Pages 297 and 298 of the brief). Therefore, it is clear that the position taken by the defendant in its answer that there was no acceptance of the goods, was a fraudulent attempt by the defendant to avoid the payment of monies that were due to the plaintiff. 15. The learned President\u2019s Counsel for the defendant submitted that, the goods had perished due to the delay in getting the goods released from the harbor. Although it was submitted that defendant had to pay heavy demurrage, no document or a receipt was submitted to prove that they had to pay such heavy demurrage. It is for the defendant to submit those documents if in fact they had paid heavy demurrage. Further, there is also no evidence to show that the goods were perished by the time the defendant got the goods released. 16. The defendant's own document dated 03.02.1997 (D8) clearly shows that the defendant has cleared the full consignment of the goods from the harbor. The defendant has mentioned that some of the goods were damaged and that they have made a claim for insurance on the same. The defendant\u2019s own witness U.G Dayananda, in his evidence has stated that, the insurance company refused to pay on the said claim. Further, the defendant has failed to submit any document at least to show that they made a claim to the insurance company with regard to the perished items. Therefore, it is clear that the defendant has taken various false defenses to avoid the payment that was due to the plaintiff.",

P11, dated 09.01.1997, where the defendants requested for D.A. terms payable after 60 days is also admitted by parties. 28. Therefore, it is clear that this action falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance and is based on a written contract. Hence, this action is not prescribed and the position taken by the defendant that the action is out of time cannot be maintained. 29. Hence, the appeal is dismissed with costs.",
