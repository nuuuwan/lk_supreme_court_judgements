"","The Court of Appeal has quoted Section 7 of the Exchange Control Act and stated"

"","For  the  purpose  of  clarity,  it  may  be  pointed  out  that  section  7  of  the  Exchange"
"","Control Act - refers to ‘any payment’, thereby making it immaterial as to whether"
"the payment is made in foreign or local currency”.",""
"","In the absence of a proper explanation to the contrary in regard to such payment,"
"","this view appears to be supported by the fact that, if the parties to the said Agreement"
"","acted on the basis that they were “resident in Sri Lanka”, in terms of the Exchange"
"","Control  Act,  there  would  have  been  no  requirement  under  the  Act  for  the  said"
"","Agreement to provide that the purchase price of the said shares should be paid to a"
