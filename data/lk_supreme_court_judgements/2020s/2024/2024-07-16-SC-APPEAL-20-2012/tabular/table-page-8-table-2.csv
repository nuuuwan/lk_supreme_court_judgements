"In regard to the evidence led at the trial, the Judgment of the Court of Appeal stated,"
"as follows –"
"“The evidence of the Plaintiff-Appellant was very brief other than a long line of"
"questions  to  prove  signature  in  P1  and  comparison  of  P1  with  P2  and  P3  to"
"identify the signature. In contrast Defendant’s evidence was on point to establish"
"issue Nos (2)-(6) and as such version of the Defendant-Respondents becomes more"
"probable.  In  fact  the  defence  version  was  supported  by  statutory  provisions,"
"namely, Exchange Control Act. Plaintiff-Appellant does not rely on any statutory"
"provisions but only argue that the above statute has no application to the facts of"
"this case. I am unable to agree with the Plaintiff-Appellant on that argument”."
