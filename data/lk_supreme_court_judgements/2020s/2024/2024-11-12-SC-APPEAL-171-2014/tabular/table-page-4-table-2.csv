"In Parusselle Dhammejoty Unnanse v. Tikiri Banda Parenatale and Others"
"(1881) 4 SCC 121 at 123, Dias J. stated:"
"[T]he  well-known  tenure  of  Sisyanu  Sisiya  Parampararve,  which"
"means ‘pupillary succession’ or ‘succession from pupil to pupil’. The"
"second word ‘anu’ means ‘each by each’ or ‘orderly’, and the effect"
"of that word seems to me to limit the succession to the descending"
"line, to the exclusion of both the ascending and the collateral lines."
"Thus we see that, according to the strict grammatical meaning of the"
"words Sisyanu Sisiya Parampararve, the line of succession is limited"
"to pupils of the descending line."
