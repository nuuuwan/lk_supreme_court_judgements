"think the case is different where the tutor abandons his right to an"
"incumbency.  Disrobing,  with 
the 
intention 
of 
giving  up 
the"
"priesthood,  is  the  equivalent,  ecclesiastically,  of  personal  demise,"
"and it does not entail, any more than death entails, an abandonment"
"of rights, but merely a personal incapacity to exercise them. These"
"rights  can  accordingly  descend 
to  a  pupillary  successor.  The"
"abandonment  of  an  incumbency  by  a  priest,  on  the  other  hand,"
"constitutes 
the 
forfeiture  of 
that 
to  which  his  pupilsâ€™ 
right  of"
"succession  are  attached,  namely  the  incumbency  itself.  The  priest"
"remains a priest, but abandons his rights to the incumbency, upon"
"which 
the  pupillary  rights  of  succession  are  dependent.  There"
"accordingly remain no rights for the pupil to inherit."
