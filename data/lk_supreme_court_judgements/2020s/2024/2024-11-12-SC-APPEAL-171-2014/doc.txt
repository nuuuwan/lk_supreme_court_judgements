Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff, Gatamanne Dhammalankara Thero, instituted this action

in the District Court of Tangalle against the defendant, Gatamanne

Sasanaratana Thero, seeking a declaration that he is the controlling

Viharadhipathi of Siri Sunanda Maha Viharaya of Beliatta, the ejectment

of the defendant, and damages. The defendant countersued for

Viharadhipathiship of the said temple. After trial, the District Court

entered judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the High Court

of Civil Appeal of Tangalle. Hence this appeal by the defendant to this

Court.

The plaintiff in his evidence accepted that Hakmana Gunananda Thero

died in 1956 leaving three pupils: Kakunewala Indagutta Thero (the most

senior pupil), Tharaperiye Buddhasoma Thero (the second most senior

pupil) and Walakande Dhammawasa Thero (the third most senior pupil).

Dhammawasa Thero died in 1968, Indagutta Thero died in 1969, and

Buddhasoma Thero died in 1972.

The plaintiffs position is that Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero

forfeited their rights to Viharadhipathiship by abandonment, and

therefore, after the death of Gunananda Thero, Dhammawasa Thero

became the Viharadhipathi by operation of the rule of pupillary

succession. According to the Upasampada Declaration marked P5, the

plaintiff is a pupil of Dhammawasa Thero. Consequently, the plaintiff

3

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

claims that he is entitled to the Viharadhipathiship following the death

of Dhammawasa Thero.

The defendant denies that Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero

forfeited their rights to Viharadhipathiship by abandonment. He asserts

that Dhammawasa Thero was only the de facto Viharadhipathi of the

temple, whereas the de jure Viharadhipathi was Indagutta Thero. He

further states that the two pupils of Indagutta Thero (whose Upasampada

Declarations were marked P11 and P12) disrobed after the death of

Indagutta Thero, and therefore, upon the death of Dhammawasa Thero,

Owilane Dhammaransi Thero who was a pupil of Buddhasoma Thero was

appointed as the Viharadhipathi, as evidenced by P9.

The Upasampada Declaration of Dhammaransi Thero marked V1 shows

that, Dhammaransi Thero was a pupil of Buddhasoma Thero. The

Upasampada Declaration of the defendant marked P7 shows that, the

defendant is a pupil of Dhammaransi Thero. Consequently, the defendant

claims that he is entitled to the Viharadhipathiship following the death

of Dhammaransi Thero in 1984.

The crux of the matter is whether Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma

Thero, the first and second most senior pupils of Gunananda Thero,

forfeited their rights to Viharadhipathiship by abandonment. If they did,

the plaintiff must succeed, and if they did not, the defendant must

succeed.

Both parties accept that the succession to the Viharadhipathiship of this

temple is governed by the rule of pupillary succession (

). The rule of pupillary succession entails succession from pupil

to pupil in order of seniority, not from pupil to co-pupil/fellow-

pupil/collateral-pupil, notwithstanding that the co-pupil is more senior

than the pupil who is in the direct line of succession. This ensures

4

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

succession by the most senior pupil to his tutor. If B and C are pupils of

A, after the death of A as Viharadhipathi, B succeeds to the

Viharadhipathiship as the senior pupil of A. After the death of B, the

Viharadhipathiship passes to the senior pupil of B, not to the fellow-pupil

C.

In Parusselle Dhammejoty Unnanse v. Tikiri Banda Parenatale and Others

(1881) 4 SCC 121 at 123, Dias J. stated:

[T]he well-known tenure of Sisyanu Sisiya Parampararve, which

means pupillary succession or succession from pupil to pupil. The

second word anu means each by each or orderly, and the effect

of that word seems to me to limit the succession to the descending

line, to the exclusion of both the ascending and the collateral lines.

Thus we see that, according to the strict grammatical meaning of the

words Sisyanu Sisiya Parampararve, the line of succession is limited

to pupils of the descending line.

It is against the rule of pupillary succession for a Viharadhipathi to

appoint a co-pupil to the Viharadhipathiship over his own pupils.

(Gunananda Unnanse v. Dewarakita Unnanse (1924) 26 NLR 257,

Warakapitiya Sangananda Terunnanse v. Meeruppe Sumanatissa

Terunnanse (1963) 66 NLR 394) However, it is open to a Viharadhipathi

to appoint any particular pupil as his successor for different reasons.

(Dhammajothi v. Sobita (1913) 16 NLR 408 at 409, Jinaratna Thero v.

Somaratana Thero (1946) 47 NLR 228, Basnagoda Hemaloka v.

v. Sangananda Thero [1991] 2 Sri LR 230 at 243-244) Such an

appointment need not necessarily be in writing but must be clear and

unambiguous. (Sirinivasa Thero v. Wimaladhamma Thero [1985] 2 Sri LR

40, Thalawatugoda Siriratna Thero v. Veherewatte Ariyawansa Thero

[1995] 2 Sri LR 139)

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

Abandonment of Viharadhipathiship constitutes total severance, both

physically and mentally, of association with the temple to which the

priest has the legal right to Viharadhipathiship. It needs to be done by

the priest consciously and deliberately. There is no presumption in favour

of abandonment, but rather the presumption is against it. One reason for

such scrutiny is that abandonment affects not only the rights of the

relevant priest but also the rights of his pupils. In other words, if the tutor

is proved to have abandoned his right to Viharadhipathiship, it affects

the pupillary succession. The priest alleging abandonment of lawful

rights to the Viharadhipathiship of another priest must prove this claim

strictly by cogent evidence, not by conjectures. No hard and fast rules

can be laid down to prove abandonment. It is a question of fact that

should be decided on the unique facts and circumstances of each case.

There is no requirement that the Viharadhipathi must take residence in

the temple of which he is the Viharadhipathi or claiming to be the

Viharadhipathi for him to keep that right alive. In terms of section 2 of

the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, No. 19 of 1931, as amended,

Viharadhipathi means the principal bhikkhu of a temple other than a

dewale or kovila, whether resident or not. The presiding priest, not

necessarily the residing priest, is considered the Viharadhipathi of the

temple. According to the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, the principal

bhikkhu or the presiding bhikkhu is the controlling Viharadhipathi,

who controls and administers the temple and provides leadership. He is

the de jure Viharadhipathi. It is the de jure Viharadhipathi, not the de

facto Viharadhipathi, who is entitled to the protection of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance. (Dhammadaja Thero v. Wimalajothi Thero

(1977) 79(1) NLR 145 at 160-162, Amarawansa Thero v. Panditha

Galwehera Amaragnana Thero [1985] 2 Sri LR 275) The de jure

Viharadhipathi is typically a senior and elderly priest who holds the

Viharadhipathiship of several temples. He takes residence in one of his

6

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

temples based on his convenience. He is unable to control and administer

the temples by himself but does so through other priests who reside in

the temples. These other priests act as de facto Viharadhipathis.

However, based on their control and administration of the affairs of the

temple under the de jure Viharadhipathi, these other priests cannot claim

Viharadhipathiship outside the rule of pupillary succession.

Warakapitiya Sangananda Terunnanse v. Meeruppe Sumanatissa

Terunnanse (1963) 66 NLR 394 at 396, Sansoni J. (as he then was)

declared:

It is quite usual for a monk who is the Viharadhipathi of several

temples to give charge of one or more of those temples to other

monks, who would normally reside in and look after those temples

and their temporalities. It is not always convenient for a

Viharadhipathi to look after temples which are situated some

distance away from the temple in which he resides, and he may

appoint managers or deputies for this reason. Any acts of possession

or management by such appointees are referable to that

appointment; they would all be on behalf of the lawful

Viharadhipathi and would not give the appointee any claim to that

title.

In Jinaratana Thero v. Dhammaratana Thero (1955) 57 NLR 372 at 374,

Basnayake A.C.J. (as he then was) stated:

The office of Viharadhipati is not one that can be abandoned by mere

residence in another place. There is nothing in the Vinaya or the

decisions of this Court which requires a Viharadhipati to reside in

the temple of which he is Viharadhipati. A bhikkhu who is

Viharadhipati of more than one temple must of necessity reside in

one place at a time and the mere fact that he makes one of the

7

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

temples his permanent residence does not operate as a renunciation

of his right to the others.

Basnayake A.C.J. in Dhammavisuddhi Thero v. Dhammadassi Thero

(1955) 57 NLR 469 at 472 made it clear that residence in a temple, along

with the management of its day-to-day affairs for any length of time, does

not confer upon a priest the right to claim Viharadhipathiship of that

temple:

The residence of a bhikkhu for whatever length of time in a Sanghika

temple gives him no right to be viharadhipati, for every bhikkhu is

entitled, as a member of the Sangha, to reside and participate in the

religious activities of a temple subject to the consent express or

implied of the viharadhipati. The right to an incumbency cannot be

acquired by residence merely because the rightful incumbent does

not visit the temple often enough or resides elsewhere for the most

part. There being no particular duties, spiritual or temporal, which a

viharadhipati need perform for the purpose of keeping alive his

rights, it cannot be said to be lost because another bhikkhu who is

actually residing in the temple manages its affairs and prevents the

temple from falling into decay. Those are obligations which any

bhikkhu resident in a vihare may properly perform for the sake of

preserving the property of the Sangha. It will be contrary to the

Vinaya to hold that the performance of such duties gives to the

performer rights in the temple and is prejudicial to the rights of the

lawful viharadhipati.

The same was emphasized by Basnayake C.J. in Panditha Watugedera

Amaraseeha Thero v. Tittagalle Sasanatilake Thero (1957) 59 NLR 289 at

290-291:

8

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

The fact that a bhikkhu takes an active interest in the religious and

other activities of a temple gives him no right to be viharadhipati even

if his activities extend over a long period of time, nor is he entitled in

law to base a claim to the temple on the ground that he has helped

to improve it. A de jure viharadhipati does not lose his rights merely

because he has expressly or impliedly permitted another to occupy

his temple and take an active interest in its maintenance and

improvement.

As I stated previously, proof of abandonment requires both a physical

and a mental element. It must be proved that staying away from the

temple was done with the conscious intention of severing the relationship

with the temple. It is not always possible to prove intention by direct

evidence. Intention can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of

the case. However, such inferences can only be drawn when there is clear

and unambiguous evidence to support them. Basnayake A.C.J. in

Panditha Watugedera Amaraseeha Theros case remarked at page 374

that an intention to renounce will not be inferred unless that intention

clearly appears therefrom upon a strict interpretation of the facts and

circumstances of the case. If the facts and circumstances leave the matter

in doubt then the inference to be drawn is that there is no renunciation.

In Welakanda Dhammasiddi v. Kamburupitiye Somaloka Thero [1990] 1

Sri LR 234 at 243, Ranasighe C.J. put this in clearer terms:

[A]bandonment connotes both a physical and a mental element: it

means and requires both a giving-up of or going away from the

temple, coupled with a clear manifestation of a decision not to attend

to the functions and duties which are traditionally associated with

and are expected to be performed by one who holds such office:

whether a person, who was, in law, entitled to succeed to the

incumbency, has so conducted himself is a question of fact: that such

9

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

conduct must be conscious, deliberate, and must be clearly

established and should not be left in doubt.

In Welakanda Dhammasiddis case, following the death of the previous

incumbent, a meeting was convened to appoint a Viharadhipathi,

presided over by the Chief Sanga Nayake of the District. The defendants

name was proposed, and the plaintiff seconded this proposal on the basis

that he was residing in one of the temples of the paramparawa and had

accepted an appointment as a teacher in the Education Department. This

Court held that such secondment does not constitute abandonment of

the rights to Viharadhipathiship of that temple.

In Kalegama Ananda Thero v. Makkuddala Gnanissara Thero [1999] 2 Sri

LR 218 at 222, G.P.S. de Silva C.J. stated that In Buddhist Ecclesiastical

Law there is a strong presumption against the abandonment of the legal

right of the lawful Viharadhipathi to function as the Viharadhipathi of the

Vihare. In that case, the main item of evidence relied upon by the

defendant to prove abandonment on the part of the plaintiffs tutor was

an admission made in a previous case filed by the defendants tutor to

eject a trespasser from the temple land. In that instance, the plaintiffs

tutor, when called as a witness had stated that the defendants tutor (the

plaintiff in that case) was the rightful Viharadhipathi of the temple and

that he makes no claim to the Viharadhipathiship of that temple. Chief

Justice G.P.S. de Silva stated that the abandonment could not be proved

on that evidence where the intention of both priests was to protect the

temple property from the trespasser. This underscores that no strict rules

can be formulated to decide on abandonment and even admissions made

in judicial proceedings in a different context are not decisive in proving

such a claim.

In Dhammadaja Thero v. Wimalajothi Thero (1977) 79(1) NLR 145, the

plaintiffs tutor appointed the defendant who was a co-pupil of his as his

10

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

successor to the Viharadhipathiship by a Deed. All of the tutors pupils

including the plaintiff who was his most senior pupil signed the Deed

expressing their consent to that appointment. On the question of

abandonment, it was held that the said consent given by the plaintiff to

please his tutor was not decisive to hold that the plaintiff forfeited his

rights to Viharadhipathiship by abandonment. Gunasekera J. at page

193 went so far as to state inter alia that the Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law

does not recognize such a renunciation of the right to function as

Viharadhipathi. The office of Viharadhipathi is inalienable and a priest on

whom this office has devolved according to the sisyanu sisya

paramparawa rule of succession only holds it in his life time to pass it on

according to law, to his senior pupil or such other pupil as he may select.

The plaintiffs own evidence in the instant case proves that Indagutta

Thero and Buddhasoma Thero did not completely sever their relationship

with the temple so as to arrive at a finding against them on abandonment.

They resided in different temples. However, according to the evidence of

the plaintiff and his witness Edwin, Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma

Thero participated in various significant ceremonies at the temple,

including robing () ceremonies, Upasampada () ceremonies,

and Maha Pinkamas ( ). Notably, Buddhasoma Thero passed

away in the temple in question. It is unnecessary for me to quote the

evidence verbatim. There is no cogent evidence to establish that

Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero completely severed their ties

with the temple.

The Civil Appellate High Court held that Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero did not completely sever the relationship with the

temple. The High Court accepted that both Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero participated in the important events of the temple

but concluded that there was no evidence indicating their involvement in

11

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

the specific duties assigned to a Viharadhipathi during these events.

Notably, the High Court did not describe the duties of a Viharadhipathi,

nor did it specify the particular responsibilities that Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero allegedly failed to fulfil. The High Court articulated

its position as follows:

, ,

.

.

.

.

.

. .

.

.

In Dhammavisuddhi Thero v. Dhammadassi Thero (1955) 57 NLR 469 at

472, Basnayake A.C.J. observed that There [are] no particular duties,

spiritual or temporal, which a viharadhipati need perform for the purpose

of keeping alive his rights. However, according to the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance, there are specific rights and duties associated

with the role of the controlling Viharadhipathi. Section 4(2) of the

Ordinance states The management of the property belonging to every

temple exempted from the operation of the last preceding subsection but

not exempted from the operation of the entire Ordinance shall be vested in

the viharadhipati of such temple, hereinafter referred to as the controlling

12

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

viharadhipati. However, as I explained previously, this does not mean

that the de jure Viharadhipathi must personally discharge those duties

by himself.

It is clear that P9 dated 25.10.1968 is the central document in the case.

Although P9 was marked by the plaintiff, both parties heavily rely upon

it. As the document itself expressly indicates, it relates to the

appointment of the Viharadhipathi of the temple in question following the

death of the then Viharadhipathi, Dhammawasa Thero, whom the

defendant states was the de facto Viharadhipathi. The High Court

regarded P9 as decisive evidence in support of the claim of abandonment:

.9 .

.

.

.

.

The death of Dhammawasa Thero on 20.10.1968 was undoubtedly a

significant event. There is no dispute that both Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero attended the funeral. The date on which the

cremation took place is not clear. As the High Court admits, they

13

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

attended main events of the temple. Following the funeral rituals, a

solemn assembly of senior and junior monks related to the temple

convened on 25.10.1968, as per P9, to appoint a succeeding

Viharadhipathi. Both Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero

participated in the meeting. Had there had been a total severance of their

association with the temple, they would not have taken part in this

important event. According to P9, the meeting was chaired by none other

than Indagutta Thero. This goes to indicate that he was the de jure

Viharadhipathi of the temple. At that time, Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero were elderly monks.

The unanimous decision of the clergy, as recorded in P9, was to appoint

Owilane Dhammaransi Thero as the permanent Viharadhipathi. All

senior priests, including Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero, signed

the document. It appears that the plaintiff also attended this meeting, as

he stated in his evidence that P9 was handed over to him for safekeeping.

P9 is a two-page document containing names and signatures, among

other details. Let me quote only the first paragraph of P9 to provide some

insight into the document:

1968.10.25 1968.10.25

,

.

P9 was marked by the plaintiff at the trial to establish two key matters:

(a) that at the time of the demise of Dhammawasa Thero, Dhammawasa

Thero held the position of Viharadhipathi of the temple in question, and

14

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

(b) that, in terms of seniority, the plaintiff is recognized as the first pupil

and the defendant as the sixth pupil of Dhammawasa Thero.

According to the Upasampada Declaration of Dhammaransi Thero

marked V1, he is the pupil of Buddhasoma Thero, and according to the

Upasampada Declaration of the defendant marked V2, he is the pupil of

Dhammaransi Thero, not Dhammawasa Thero, as indicated in P9. The

evidence of Edwin proves that the relationship between Buddhasoma

Thero (tutor) and Dhammaransi Thero (pupil) was close and warm. He

stated that when Buddhasoma Thero was in his last stage of his life,

Dhammaransi Thero brought him to the temple in question and looked

after him. I have already stated that Buddhasoma Thero passed away in

this temple.

When inconsistencies arise regarding details of priesthood among various

documents, the details contained in the Upasampada Declaration should

take precedence. The Upasampada ceremony is conducted with the

utmost solemnity and adheres to the highest traditions and

responsibilities, as affirmed in Rev. Dharmatilleke Thero v. Rev.

Buddharakkita Thero [1993] 1 Sri LR 405. Therefore, in assessing the

details recorded in the Upasampada Declaration V2 and the minutes of

the meeting recorded in P9, the Court should regard the information in

V2 as accurate. V2 has been signed by the defendant, Dhammaransi

Thero, and the Mahanayaka Thero.

If Dhammawasa Thero was the de jure Viharadhipathi and the plaintiff

was the most senior pupil of Dhammawasa Thero, it remains unclear why

the plaintiff was not appointed as the Viharadhipathi of the temple. At

that time, the plaintiff was not a Samanera Bhikku but an Upasampada

Bhikku. The plaintiff asserts in his evidence that, being only 21 years old

at that time, Dhammaransi Thero was appointed as the Viharadhipathi

15

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

as a temporary measure. However, there is no impediment to appointing

a 21-year-old Upasampada Bhikku as the Viharadhipathi.

The appointment of Dhammaransi Thero as the Viharadhipathi was not,

according to P9, a temporary arrangement until the plaintiff became a

more senior priest. It was a permanent appointment (

.). The plaintiff has not raised

any objections to this appointment for 16 years, whether expressly or

impliedly, to the senior priests, the office of the Commissioner of

Buddhist Affairs, or any other official until after the death of the

appointee, Dhammaransi Thero, in 1984.

After the death of Dhammaransi Thero in 1984, the plaintiff waited

another 12 years to institute this action in 1996 to claim for

Viharadhipathiship. The plaintiff states that he attempted to settle the

dispute thorough Nikaya. However, his counsel in the District Court has

conceded that when the rule of pupillary succession applies, Nikaya

cannot decide on Viharadhipathiship.

In explaining the reason for abandonment by Buddhasoma Thero, the

plaintiff and witness Edwin state that Buddhasoma Thero was accused

of immoral conduct and therefore he left the temple. There is no credible

evidence to substantiate this. The plaintiff and witness Edwin also do not

give affirmative evidence on that matter. They, in my view, stated it in

passing. If that allegation is correct, I fail to understand how

Buddhasoma Thero participated in the important events of the temple

including the decisive meeting to select a Viharadhipathi after the demise

of Dhammawasa Thero. His involvement in such critical affairs suggests

a close association with the temple, contradicting the assertion of

abandonment.

16

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

Edwin in his evidence also stated that, after the death of Dhammawasa

Thero, he along with several other members of the Dayaka Sabhawa

visited Buddhasoma Thero at a different temple where he resided to invite

him to accept the Viharadhipathiship of the temple in question, which he

declined. This evidence was given to prove abandonment of

Viharadhipathiship but it also supports the contrary. If Buddhasoma

Thero was forced to leave the temple on an allegation of immoral conduct,

I cannot understand how the Dayaka Sabhawa members invited him to

accept the Viharadhipathiship.

Assuming without conceding that the said allegation is correct, according

to Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law, it does not affect the defendants right to

claim Viharadhipathiship under pupillary succession. The pupillary right

of succession remains intact regardless of any alleged wrongdoing by the

tutor. It was held in Dammaratna Unnanse v. Sumangala Unnanse (1910)

14 NLR 400: The fact that a tutor disrobes himself for immorality or other

reason does not affect the pupils status as regards the right of pupillary

succession.

However, the abandonment of rights to the Viharadhipathiship by the

tutor does affect the rights of the pupil to the Viharadhipathiship, as the

rights of the latter are contingent upon those of the former. Thus, any

determination regarding the abandonment of rights by the tutor must be

carefully considered, as it directly impacts the pupils entitlement to the

Viharadhipathiship.

Ranasinghe C.J. in Welakanda Dhammasiddi v. Kamburupitiya Somaloka

Thero [1990] 1 Sri LR 234 at 239 explained this in the following manner:

It has been held in Dammaratna Unnanse v. Sumangala Unnanse

(supra) that when a tutor disrobes himself for immorality, this does

not deprive his pupils of their rights of pupillary succession. But I

17

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

think the case is different where the tutor abandons his right to an

incumbency. Disrobing, with the intention of giving up the

priesthood, is the equivalent, ecclesiastically, of personal demise,

and it does not entail, any more than death entails, an abandonment

of rights, but merely a personal incapacity to exercise them. These

rights can accordingly descend to a pupillary successor. The

abandonment of an incumbency by a priest, on the other hand,

constitutes the forfeiture of that to which his pupils right of

succession are attached, namely the incumbency itself. The priest

remains a priest, but abandons his rights to the incumbency, upon

which the pupillary rights of succession are dependent. There

accordingly remain no rights for the pupil to inherit.

At the argument before this Court, learned Presidents Counsel for both

parties accepted that the main questions of law to be decided by this

Court are:

(a) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law when it decided that

Indagutta Thero and Buddhasoma Thero abandoned the rights to

the Viharadhipathiship of the temple in question?

(b) Did the High Court of Civil Appeal fail to analyze P9 in its proper

perspective?

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I hold that:

(a) In the order of seniority, Indagutta Thero, Buddhasoma Thero and

Dhammawasa Thero are pupils of Hakmana Gunananda Thero;

(b) The plaintiff has failed to prove that Indagutta Thero and

Buddhasoma Thero forfeited their rights to Viharadhipathiship by

abandonment;

(c) Dhammawasa Thero was only the de facto Viharadhipathi of the

temple in charge of its affairs;

18

SC/APPEAL/171/2014

(d) After the death of Dhammawasa Thero, Dhammaransi Thero

became the de jure Viharadhipathi of the temple as the pupil of

Buddhasoma Thero;

(e) After the death of Dhammaransi Thero, the defendant became the

de jure Viharadhipathi of the temple as the pupil of Dhammaransi

Thero.

I answer both questions of law in the affirmative. The judgments of the

District Court and the High Court of Civil Appeal are set aside and the

appeal is allowed. The plaintiffs action of the District Court shall stand

dismissed. The District Court is directed to enter judgment as prayed for

in paragraph (iii) of the amended answer dated 22.03.1999 declaring that

the defendant is the lawful Viharadhipathi of the temple in question. Let

the parties bear their own costs.
