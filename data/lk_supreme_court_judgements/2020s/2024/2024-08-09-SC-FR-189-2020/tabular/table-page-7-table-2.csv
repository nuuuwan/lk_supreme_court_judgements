"to comply with the applicable rules and the procedure.”"
"When considering the above, it is clear that this Court is mindful of the circumstances under which"
"the Petitioner had come before this Court and the extent to which the Rules apply to each case. In"
"the case P. Thavarajanie vs. Kanaganayagam (supra) this Court had permitted the petitioner to file"
"fresh papers before the objection was raised. However, in the instant case, the Court was satisfied"
"with the material submitted by the Petitioners when the matter was supported to leave and granted"
"leave to proceed for alleged violations under Articles 12 (1), 12 (2) and 14 (1) (b) of the Constitution."
"Even though the Court could have acted under Rule 44 (7) and referred the matter to the Legal Aid"
"Commission, the Court was satisfied that the Petitioners had submitted sufficient material for the"
"Court to act upon under the provisions of Rule 44 (7) and to treat the petition filed before this Court"
"under Article 126 (2) of the Constitution."
"In the said circumstances this Court is satisfied that the Petitioners have not violated Rules 44 (1)"
"(a) and (d) when invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) of"
"the Constitution. I therefore overrule the said preliminary objection."
"As revealed before this Court from the submissions made by the 1st Petitioner and the documents"
"placed before this Court, one of the main grievances complained before this Court was the failure"
"by the authorities to  register the two premises  bearing Nos.  72/11 and 72/11A, Sakvithi Uyana,"
"Jayamalapura,  Gampola  under  Udapalatha  Divisional  Secretary’s  Division  and  register  the  three"
"Petitioners and the spouses of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners in the electoral register of Jayamalapura"
"Grama Niladhari Division which comes within the Gampola Electoral District."
"As submitted by the 1st Petitioner, he was residing with his family in Athgala East Grama Niladhari"
"Division,  and  two  of  his  daughters  namely  Erandi  Upuli  Dharmarathne  and  Udari  Nedishika"
