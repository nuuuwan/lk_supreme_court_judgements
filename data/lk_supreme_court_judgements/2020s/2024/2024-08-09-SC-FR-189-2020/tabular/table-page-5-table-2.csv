"In the case of S.P. Guptha vs. Union of India AIR 1982 SC 149, 234 Bhagwati J had observed the"
"compliance of rules as follows;"
"“It is true that there are rules made by this Court prescribing the procedure for moving this"
"Court for relief under Article 32 (Indian Constitution) and they require various formalities to"
"be gone through by a person seeking to approach this Court. But it must not be forgotten"
"that procedure is but a hand- maiden of justice and the cause of justice can never be allowed"
"to be thwarted by any procedural technicalities. The Court would therefore unhesitatingly"
"and without the slightest qualms of conscience cast aside the technical rules of procedure in"
"the exercise of its dispensing power and treat the letter of public minded individual as a writ"
"petition and act upon it.”"
