"whilst  referring  to  another  decision  by  Dr.  Amarasinghe  J  and  to  the  decision  in  the  case  of"
"Leelawathie Manike vs. Dharmasinghe Bandara (supra) had observed as follows;"
"…………………  The  Petitioner  had  submitted  further  that  Rule  44  (1)  of  SC  Rule 
is  not"
"mandatory,  but  only  directory  and  had  referred  to  the  decision 
in  SC  Appeal  72/2011"
"Leelawathie Manike vs. Dharmasinghe Bandara and Another, where the Court remarked that"
"“Rules should not obstruct the path of justice”"
"“I wish however to rely on the pronouncement made by Justice Dr. Amarasinghe in the case"
"of Fernando vs. Sybil Fernando 1997 (3) Sri LR page 1 wherein Justice Amarasinghe, signifying"
"the importance of procedural law, stated,"
"There is the substantive law and there is the procedural law, procedural law is not secondary."
"The  two  branches  are  complementary  the  maxim  ubi 
ius, 
ibi  remedium  reflects  the"
"complementary  character  of  Civil  Procure  Law.  The  two  branches  are  also  independent,"
"Halsbury (ibid) points out that the interplay between the two branches often conceals what"
"is substantive and what is procedural. It is by the procedure that the law is put into motion,"
"and  it  is  procedural  law  which  puts  the  life  into  substantive  law,  gives  it  remedy  and"
"effectiveness, and brings it into being.”"
"It was the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that when the fresh petition was"
"filed by the Attorney at Law for the Petitioner, it no longer can be treated as an informal"
"complaint which attracts the part of Rule 44 (7)."
"It was further submitted that when such permission was granted to file a fresh petition, he"
"was expected to act with due diligence and was required to comply with the applicable Rules"
"and  therefore  the  prayer  to  petition  should  have  specified  the  threshold  relief  or  redress"
"including the grant of leave to proceed in the first instance, in terms of Rule 44 (1) (d) of the"
"Supreme Court Rules."
