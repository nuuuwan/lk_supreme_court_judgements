"due to injuries he received whilst in police custody and in the above context Shirani Bandaranayake"
"J observed,"
"“It could never be contended that the right ceased and would become ineffective due to the"
"intervention of the death of the person, especially in circumstances where the death in itself"
"is the consequence of injuries that constitute the infringement.  If such an interpretation is"
"not given it would result in a preposterous situation in which a person who is tortured and"
"survives could vindicate his rights in proceedings before this Court, but if the torture is so"
"intensive that it results in death, the right cannot be vindicated in proceedings before this"
"Court. In my view, a strict literal construction should not be resorted to where it produces"
"such an absurd result.”"
