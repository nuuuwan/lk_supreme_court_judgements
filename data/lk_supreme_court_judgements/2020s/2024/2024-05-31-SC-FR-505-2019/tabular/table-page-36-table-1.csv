"101.  With  regards  to  the  National  Police  Commission,  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"submitted during the course of these proceedings that he does not intend to move"
"against its members. Despite this, we direct the National Police Commission to take"
"cognizance of the pressing need to improve the standards of the Police Force."
"CONCLUSION & CONSEQUENTIAL ORDERS"
"102.  The  conduct  of  the  Respondents,  judged  even  by  the  lowest  of  standards,  is  a"
"magnificent failure of all that the Rule of Law stands for. They have no doubt acted in"
"a manner unbefitting of public office."
"103.  How are we to sympathize with their contention of bona fides when they have been"
"absolutely insensitive towards even the most basic needs of the arrestees? The fact"
"that  the  Petitioner  had  to  breastfeed  the  child  inside  the  vehicle  tells  us  that  the"
"Respondents have had scant regard towards her dignity and even the mere rudiments"
"of human decency."
"104.  What  is  worse,  perhaps,  is  the  Respondents’  abhorrent  attempt  to  underplay  the"
"Petitioner’s woes by suggesting that she had undergone all this trouble, while putting"
"her own child through the same, on her own volition."
"105.  In  view  of  the  aforementioned,  I  hold  that  the  13th  and  14th  Respondents,  in  this"
"extraordinary display of ineptitude and incompetence, have violated the fundamental"
"rights  of  the  Petitioner  guaranteed  under  Articles  13(1),  13(2)  and  14(1)(h)  of  the"
"Constitution."
"106.  As the mother and child of the Petitioner are not party to this case and the Petition"
"of the Petitioner has not made any submissions vis-à-vis the rights of the Petitioner’s"
"mother and child, I make no orders in their regard."
"107.  Furthermore,  I  do  not  see  it  just  and  equitable  to  impose  upon  the  taxpayer  the"
"burden  of  compensating  for  the  transgressions  of  dysfunctional  public  agencies,"
"SC/FRA/505/19                         JUDGMENT                                    Page 36 of 38"
