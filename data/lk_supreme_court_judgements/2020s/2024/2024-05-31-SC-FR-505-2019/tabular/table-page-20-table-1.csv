"48. Regarding the contention as to Section 19 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No."
"15  of  1979,  the  interpretation  so  put  forward  by  the  Respondents,  in  my  view,  is"
"neither  rational  nor  justifiable.  The  Respondents’  submission  was  that  Section  19"
"imposes upon a person a duty to assist law enforcement officers except where there"
"is a “substantial risk of physical harm”."
"49. I  am  not  inclined  to  agree  with  this  interpretation  of  Section  19  to  any  extent"
"whatsoever. Great emphasis must be placed upon the words “reasonably demanding"
"his aid”."
"50. A person is bound to aid only when such demand, as well as the circumstances of"
"such demand, reasonably enables such person to aid. What is reasonable, of course,"
"depends on the circumstances of each case. What is most certainly not reasonable is"
"for peace officers to expect friends and family of a suspect to toil on their behalf. I"
