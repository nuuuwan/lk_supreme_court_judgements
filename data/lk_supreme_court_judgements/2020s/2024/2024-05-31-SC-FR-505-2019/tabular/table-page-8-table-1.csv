"they refused to comply when asked to produce identification. They had informed the"
"Respondents  that  the  Petitioner’s  husband  could  be  produced  to  the  courts 
if"
"necessary."
"19. The  14th  Respondent  had  then 
informed  the  Attorneys  of  the  presence  of  the"
"Petitioner and her mother, and they had threatened to take legal action against the"
"14th Respondent. According to the 14th Respondent, the Petitioner and her mother"
"were then taken back home to Imaduwa."
"20. The essence of the Respondents’ contentions is that they had acted bona fide at all"
"times and that the Petitioner accompanied a group of police officers—most of whom"
"were  men—with  her  21-month-old  daughter,  in  the  dead  of  night,  on  her  own"
"volition."
"ANALYSIS"
"21. In the instant case, whether there has been a violation of the Petitioner’s freedom of"
"movement is dependent upon whether there has been an arrest in the first place, and,"
"if  that  question  is  to  be  answered  in  the  affirmative,  the  legality  of  such  arrest."
"Therefore, I shall first dispense with the submissions relating to Article 13."
"22. It is trite law that fundamental rights can only be circumscribed within the permitted"
"limits of Article 15. All paragraphs thereunder place special emphasis on the words"
"“as may be prescribed by law”. The Constitution has, in no unclear terms, declared that"
"fundamental rights may only be restricted as provided by law. In effect, peace officers,"
"whose  sphere  of  activities  has  plenty  to  do  with  the  fundamental  rights  of  the"
"citizenry, have no authority whatsoever to act beyond their legal mandates in carrying"
"out their official duties."
