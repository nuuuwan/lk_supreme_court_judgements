"70. As  can  be  seen  from  the  language  of  Sections  36  and  37  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, the former requires a police officer to take or send the"
"person  arrest  before  a  Magistrate  “without  unnecessary  delay”,  whereas  the  latter"
"states  that  a  person  shall  not  be  detained  for  a  period  longer  than  “under  all  the"
"circumstances of the case reasonable”. The latter further states that such a period shall"
"not exceed twenty-four hours. What I have emphasized, in my view, are the operative"
"elements of the Sections."
