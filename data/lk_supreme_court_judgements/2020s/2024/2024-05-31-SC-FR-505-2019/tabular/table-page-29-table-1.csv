"order,  that  would  stand  equally  inimical  to  the  design  of  broadening  fundamental"
"rights as narrowing down the rights themselves, for chaos stands noxious to individual"
"rights, and anarchy antithetical."
"74. Lest we forget, from limited resources to hefty workloads, this good and honest officer"
"who works by the book is often set up for a battle uphill. Twenty-four hours means"
"little  towards  any  thorough  and  genuine  investigation.  This  is  why  the  law  itself"
"excludes the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate."
"In this setting, keeping in custody a legitimate suspect for twenty-four hours in pursuit"
"of any well-founded investigation is almost always reasonable."
"75. It is only in those extreme residual cases, with the most exceptional of circumstances,"
"does it become a violation of Article 13(2) where a person is held in detention for less"
"than twenty-four hours without producing before a judge."
"76. Arresting  a  relative  of  a  suspect  who  has  nothing  to  do  with  transgressions  under"
"investigation is most definitely so exceptional. The Petitioner of the instant application"
"had  no  involvement  whatsoever  in  the  case  being  investigated.  She  was  merely"
"present at the time when several of the Respondents visited her home looking for a"
"suspect  to  whom  she  happened  to  be  married.  The  13th  Respondent  and  his"
"subordinate  officers  have  taken  her  well  over  100  kilometres  from  the  site  of  the"
"arrest, and kept her for over twelve hours along with her mother and child, forcing"
"them to endure the midnight cold and the dreadful warmth come midday cooped"
"inside a police vehicle, without so much as food, water or lavatory facilities. I wish to"
"also  put  on  record  that  the  Respondents  have  at  no  point  denied  the  Petitionerâ€™s"
"allegations in this regard."
"77. An adult may be able to weather such conditions with difficulty, but to cause a child"
"of such tender age, whose mental faculties have only begun to develop, to undergo"
"such agony is nothing short of inhuman. Children so young should not be forced to"
