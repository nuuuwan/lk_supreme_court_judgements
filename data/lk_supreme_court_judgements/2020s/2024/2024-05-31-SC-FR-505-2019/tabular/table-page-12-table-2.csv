"Article 13 (1) of the Constitution.‚Äù 5"
"33. Even where there is no physical or formal act of taking one into custody, there can be"
"an arrest by implication through subtle coercive means. Such coercive directions may"
"be  verbal,  non-verbal, direct  or  even  constructive.  If  the  circumstances  are  such  to"
"place a reasonable person under the impression that he is able to not comply with"
"the directions of a peace officer and go about his way as he pleases, then it may be"
"said that there is no arrest. But, where the coercion of circumstances is such that a"
"person  reasonably  apprehends  that  he  has  no  option  but  to  comply,  and  his"
"autonomy  is  so  deprived,  there  is  most  certainly  an  arrest  as  contemplated  under"
"Article 13."
