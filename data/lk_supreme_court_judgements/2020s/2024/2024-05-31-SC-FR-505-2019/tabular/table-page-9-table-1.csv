"Article 13(1): Arrest & Detention"
"23. Article  13(1)  of  the  Constitution  sets  out  that  “[n]o  person  shall  be  arrested  except"
"according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the"
"reason for his arrest.”"
"24. Here,  too,  the  framers  of  the  Constitution  leave  no  ambiguity  in  declaring  that  an"
"arrest can only be made “according to procedure established by law”. All peace officers"
"are  required  by  the  constitution  to  strictly  follow  established  legal  procedure  in"
"effecting  arrests,  and  in  doing  all  other  acts  which  may  impinge  upon  personal"
"liberties. Individual dignity and liberty being at the heart of all fundamental rights, it"
"is imperative that we closely scrutinize this requirement whenever called upon."
"25. Furthermore, Article 13(1) prohibits not only arrest, in the sense of taking one into"
"custody, but also the keeping of such person in a state of arrest by imprisonment or"
"other  form  of  restraint  except  according  to  the  procedure  established  by  law.  The"
"latter is often understood as falling within the scope of Article 13(2), which, as we shall"
"see, is a misapprehension of its ambit."
"Was There an Arrest?"
"26. This  Court  has  time  and  time  again  set  out  the  legal  parameters  of  arrest  and"
"detention. The action of taking one into custody needs no formalities to amount to"
"an ‘arrest’ as contemplated in Article 13(1). The Explanation under Section 23 of the"
"Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 makes this manifestly clear."
"27. Section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states,"
"“In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch or confine"
"the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to the custody"
"by word or action and shall inform the person to be arrested of the nature of the"
"charge or allegation upon which he is arrested."
