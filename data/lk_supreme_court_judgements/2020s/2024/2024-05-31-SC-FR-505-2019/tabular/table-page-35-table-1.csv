"96. All  superior  officers  vested  with  supervisory  authority  have  a  special  duty  to  make"
"certain that their subordinates act within the bounds of their legal mandates. Superior"
"officers cannot give orders or instructions to investigate and thereafter fall asleep on"
"the  wheel.  It  is  their  duty  to  closely  supervise  and  scrutinize  the  conduct  of  those"
"officers placed under their supervision."
"97. Senior  officers  who  do  not 
take  precautions 
to  prevent  any 
infringement  of"
"fundamental rights by their subordinates and fail in their supervisory duty are as guilty"
"of  such  infringement  as  the  subordinates  who  commit  the  acts  themselves,  unless"
"such  supervising  officers  have  distanced  themselves  from  the  violation  by  taking"
"necessary steps to hold offending subordinates accountable."
"98.  What  is  even  more  concerning  is  when  superior  officers,  in  the  face  of  serious"
"fundamental rights infringements, fail to take appropriate steps to hold errant officers"
"accountable,  thus  leading  to  an  environment  of  virtual  impunity.  Such  failures  of"
"senior officers to report fundamental rights violation and take disciplinary steps, on"
"its own, may even amount to a violation of the right to equality and equal protection"
"before the law."
"99. 
I  am  of  the  view  that  the  13th  Respondent,  as  an  Officer-in-Charge,  at  the  time"
"material,  has  failed  to  fulfil  his  duty  as  a  supervising  officer,  thereby  enabling  the"
"violations of fundamental rights committed by his subordinates."
"100.  The  Affidavit  of  the  14th  Respondent  further  establishes  the 
involvement  of  SI"
"Maduranga (PC 91282), Police Driver 89729, Nirosha of the Imaduwa Police Station"
"(WPC 3541), WPC 10248 and WPC 10554 of the Galle Police Station. However, these"
"officers have not been named as Respondents in the instant case. Therefore, I make"
"no orders against them, as they have not had the opportunity to plead their case in"
"defence before this Court."
