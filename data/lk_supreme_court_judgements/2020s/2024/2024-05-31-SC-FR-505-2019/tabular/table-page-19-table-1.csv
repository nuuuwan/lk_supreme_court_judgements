"43. In addition, is this Court to believe that a husband wished for his wife to accompany"
"such  a  group  of  officers,  all  by  herself,  leaving  behind  his  daughter,  who  is  but  a"
"toddler? Need I even explain why this ludicrous version of events cannot stand the"
"test of probability?"
"44. Even if the Petitioner and her husband did, in fact, insist that she be taken on their"
"journey to Colombo for some asinine design, there was no reason for the officers to"
"comply with such requests. As I last saw it, public transport is not one of the functions"
"of a police officer. Had they been moonlighting for the Transport Board unbeknownst"
"to this Court, they should not have used a police vehicle in such ventures."
"45. The position taken by the Respondents in defence is not only ludicrous but also an"
"insult  to  this  Court’s  common  sense.  This  Court  is  not  so  detached  from  reality  to"
"gobble up whatever the feeble excuses placed before it."
"46. Upon  perusal  of  the  Investigation  Notes  of  the  14th  Respondent,16  the  Court  also"
"observes many instances where time slots are left blank. Considering this infirmity and"
"the aforementioned improbabilities, I see the evidence tendered by the Respondents"
"as sordidly unreliable. As such, common sense compels me to reject this preposterous"
"version of events in toto."
"47. The Petitioner’s version was that the officers asked her to accompany them with her"
"child in a threatening manner and that her mother, too, came forward to join them"
