"Explanation  -  Keeping  a  person  in  confinement  or  restraint  without  formally"
"arresting  him  or  under  the  colourable  pretension  that  an  arrest  has  not  been"
"made when to all intents and purposes such person is in custody shall be deemed"
"to be an arrest of such person.”"
"28. The Section further clarifies that there can be an arrest even when a person submits"
"to the custody of an officer with no physical compulsion. In fact, it is only when one"
"refuses to submit, and not otherwise, that an officer is empowered by law to touch or"
"confine the body of such person."
"29. As per Lord Denning, “[w]hen a Police Constable says to a man ‘Come along with me."
"I am taking you to the station’, that is an arrest. No matter if the man goes quietly or"
"resists with all his strength; it is an arrest.”1"
"30. As Amerasinghe J., opined in Mahinda Rajapaksa v. Kudahetti,2"
"“…in order to sustain the petitioner's claim that his fundamental right of freedom"
"from  arrest  guaranteed  by  Article  13  (1)  of  the  Constitution  has  been  violated,"
"[the petitioner] must establish that there was an apprehension of his person by"
"word  or  deed  and  an  imprisonment,  confinement,  durance  or  constraint  by"
"placing him, (such apprehension and placing having been signified by physical"
"action or by words spoken or by other conduct from which it might have been"
"inferred), in the custody, keeping, control, or under the coercive directions, of an"
"officer  of  justice  or  other  authority,  whether  the  purpose  of  such  arrest  was  to"
"enable  the  petitioner  to  be  available  and  ready  to  be  produced  to  answer  an"
"alleged or suspected crime or to assist in the detection of a crime or in the arrest"
"or prosecution of an offender or some such or other purpose of the officer making,"
"or authority ordering, the arrest. I do not intend this to be a definition of ""arrest""."
