Before : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

ARJUNA OBEYESEKERE, J

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J

Counsel : Rienzie Arrseculeratne PC for the Petitioners

Rajiv Goonetilleke DSG for the Respondents

Argued on : 21-07-2023

Decided on : 20-03-2024

P. Padman Surasena J

According to the amended Petition dated 25-09-2018, the Petitioners inter alia, have stated

that they were initially appointed to the Department of Motor Traffic on a piece-rate basis as

clerks, but thereafter received permanent appointments with effect from 01-12-2005. They

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 35 of 41

have annexed their letters of appointment marked P1(1)-P(59). The Petitioners have also

stated that they currently serve as clerks at the Department of Motor Traffic.

Upon the cabinet memorandum submitted by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, the

Cabinet of Ministers on 21-03-2017, had decided as a matter of policy in terms of paragraph

(1) of Article 55 of the Constitution, to absorb the Petitioners to the posts in the Combined

Service which would be similar to their present posts and to transfer the Petitioners out of the

Department of Motor Traffic. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers had instructed the Secretary

of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, to take action on a phased-out basis, without

interruption to the day-to-day activities of the Department of Motor Traffic, in consultation

with the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Management; Director General of

Combined Services; and other relevant authorities, to absorb the Petitioners to the Combined

Service.

The Petitioners in their amended Petition have also stated the following:

(i) Public servants who belong to various all-island services who serve on

rotational transfers have limited experience regarding some of the functions at

the Department of Motor Traffic.

(ii) The Petitioners had been working in the Department of Motor Traffic since their

date of appointment and as a result they are more experienced than the

officers who come to the Department on transfers.

It is the position of the Petitioners in the instant case, that they have joined the Department

of Motor Traffic because it was a service within the Department itself as opposed to an all-

island service. It is on that basis that the Petitioners have sought to assert that they had a

legitimate expectation to continue to work in the Department of Motor Traffic and that they

cannot be transferred out of the Department. It is on the above basis that the Petitioners have

sought to challenge the Cabinet decision dated 21-03-2017 and have prayed in their Petition

inter alia for the following main reliefs:

(a) Declaration that there is an infringement of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution by the 1st

to 62nd Respondents or any one or more of them;

(b) Declaration that the Cabinet Decision dated 21-03-2017 to transfer the

Petitioners out from the Department of Motor Traffic is null and void;

(c) Declaration that the Cabinet Decision dated 21-03-2017 to absorb the

Petitioners to the Combined Service is null and void;

(d) Declaration that the Cabinet Decision dated 21-03-2017 to retire the Petitioners

under the Minutes on Pension is null and void;

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 36 of 41

(e) Declaration that the Cabinet Decision dated 21-03-2017 to transfer the

Petitioners to the Ministry of Transport out from the Department of Motor

Traffic is null and void;

(f) Declaration that the Public Administration Circular No. 05/2018 (later changed

to Circular No.23/2018) to absorb the Petitioners to the combined service

and/or Management Assistants Service is null and void;

(g) Declaration that the aforesaid Public Administration Circular No. 05/2018 (later

changed to Circular No. 23/2018) to retire the Petitioners under the Minutes

on Pensions is null and void;

(h) Declaration that the aforesaid Public Administration Circular No. 05/2018 (later

changed to Circular No. 23/2018) to transfer the Petitioners to the Ministry of

Transport out from the Department of Motor Traffic is null and void.

The Petitioners have produced the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 21-03-2017

marked P 14(c). The Respondents have also produced the same marked R 15 and also

produced the relevant Cabinet Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers by the

Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (Cabinet Paper No. 17/03/07/709/018 dated 06-02-

2017) marked R 12(a).

The 1st Respondent, the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has filed the

affidavit dated 26-07-2019, explaining to court, the background of facts which had led to the

decision of the Cabinet of Ministers which is being impugned by the Petitioners in the instant

case. According to the said affidavit, the Petitioners were initially casual employees of the

Department of Motor Traffic who were provided work on a piece-rate basis in or around 1998

and their services were thereafter extended annually. Their services were due to be

terminated on 29-02-2004. However, on compassionate grounds, the then Minister of

Transport had recommended to the Cabinet of Ministers to absorb those piece-rate workers

who have necessary qualifications to the Combined Service. Having considered the relevant

Cabinet Memorandum in that regard, (Cabinet Memorandum dated 04-03-2005, produced

marked R 1), the Cabinet of Ministers had decided to extend the services of the piece-rate

workers for a period of one year from 28-02-2005 and to appoint a committee to report to

the Cabinet of Ministers to explore the possibility of confirming their employment. The said

decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 31-03-2005 has been produced marked R 2. After

the said committee submitted its report, the Cabinet of Ministers having considered the

recommendations of the said committee, has approved the said recommendations by its

decision dated 15-06-2005, produced marked R 3 to confirm the employment of the aforesaid

casual workers employed on a piece-rate basis.

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 37 of 41

That being the background as to how the Petitioners came to be employed in the Department

of Motor Traffic, the Petitioners now challenge the decision on 21-03-2017 made by the

Cabinet of Ministers. As the Cabinet of Ministers on 21-03-2017 had decided to absorb the

Petitioners to the posts in the Combined Service which would be similar to their present posts

and to transfer the Petitioners out of the Department of Motor Traffic as a matter of policy in

terms of paragraph (1) of Article 55 of the Constitution, let me at this stage, briefly set out

here, the power vested in the Cabinet of Ministers to determine matters of policy relating to

Public Officers. The 18th Amendment to the Constitution which was certified on 09th September

2010, repealed hitherto existed Article 55 and replaced it with new Article 55 which is as

follows;

55. (1) The Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters of policy

relating to public officers, including policy relating to appointments, promotions,

transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal.

(2) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all

Heads of Department shall, vest in the Cabinet of Ministers.

(3) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment, promotion,

transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the

Public Service Commission.

(4) The Commission shall not derogate from the powers and functions of the

Provincial Public Service Commissions as are established by law.

(5) The Commission shall be responsible and answerable to Parliament in

accordance with the provisions of the Standing Orders of Parliament for the exercise

and discharge of its powers and functions. The Commission shall also forward to

Parliament in each calendar year, a report of its activities in respect of such year.

Thus, the Cabinet of Ministers continued to retain the power in relation to appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of the Heads of Departments and also retained the

power to provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers. Article 55

(5) introduced by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution states that the Public Service

Commission will carry out its affairs according to the policies laid down by the Cabinet of

Ministers and the Public Service Commission is answerable to the parliament in regard to

carrying out of its functions.

As has been pointed out by the 1st Respondent, the Committee on Public Accounts (of the

Parliament) during the period 2016-2017 had called upon the Department of Motor Traffic and

the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to explain a number of irregularities taking place

within the Department of Motor Traffic. The 1st Respondent has substantiated this by

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 38 of 41

producing the relevant copies of the relevant minutes of the Committee on Public Accounts

meetings marked R 13(a)-R 13(d). It was thereafter that the Committee on Public Accounts

having considered the material adduced before it had directed that all officers serving in the

Department of Motor Traffic for more than five years, should be transferred. It was on the

said direction that the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation had submitted the cabinet

memorandum dated 06-02-2017 (R 14) to the Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet of Ministers

had approved the relevant recommendation by its decision dated 29-03-2017 (R 15). Thus,

it is the position of the Respondents that the Cabinet decision dated 29-03-2017 (R 16) is a

policy decision that the Cabinet of Ministers had made exercising their powers vested in them

under Article 55 of the Constitution. It is also the position of the Respondents that the circular

dated 29-08-2018 and 20-08-2018 marked R 18(a) to R 18(b) respectively are mere circulars

issued by the Ministry of Public Administration, setting out the methodology to implement the

relevant decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Respondents through the affidavit filed by the 1st Respondent and by producing the

relevant documents and the minutes of the proceedings before the Committee on Public

Accounts and also the subsequent correspondence, have established that it was necessary to

take certain measures to address the rampant corruption in the Department of Motor Traffic.

It is in that backdrop that the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation had initiated a process

through a cabinet memorandum to enable the Cabinet of Ministers to decide a suitable action

to be taken to address the issue of serious incidents of corruption taking place within the

Department of Motor Traffic. Although this court has granted a number of postponements on

the applications made by the Petitioners to enable the Petitioners to file counter objections,

the Petitioners have not sought to controvert the positions taken up by the 1st Respondents

in his affidavit by filing counter affidavits. Indeed, I observe that even after this case has been

fixed for argument, the court has made available this opportunity for the Petitioners to file

counter affidavits on several occasions before it finally fixed this case for hearing on 21-07-

2023. In view of the above, the assertions made by the Respondents with regard to the

background facts which had led to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to transfer the

relevant employees out of the Department of Motor Traffic, would stand uncontroverted.

It is to implement the said Cabinet Decision that the 1st Respondent had issued the circular

dated 24-08-2018, produced marked P17.

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 39 of 41

I observe that the Cabinet of Ministers had taken this decision with a view to address serious

incidents of corruption prevailing in the Department of Motor Traffic. The Cabinet of Ministers

had not made this decision in a way that it would treat several officers in a discriminatory

manner. The decision to transfer the employees is applicable to that category of employees

without any exception. Moreover, one must bear in mind that it is also by way of a Cabinet

decision that the Petitioners have been granted confirmation in their posts in the Department

of Motor Traffic in a manner that those appointments would be personal to them. Thus, if the

Cabinet of Ministers could make that policy at that time, I am unable to hold that it is not

open for the Cabinet of Ministers to alter that policy subsequently, particularly in view of the

presence of a grave problem affecting the whole country. The Petitioners cannot be allowed

to take the benefit of one Cabinet decision confirming them in their positions when they were

on the verge of losing their employments as piece rate workers and then attack a similar policy

being made by the Cabinet of Ministers subsequently, the effect of which, is merely to attach

them to the combined service which is a right thing to do under the prevailing circumstances.

Having regard to the circumstances described above, I am satisfied that the evidence adduced

in the instant case has disclosed that the Cabinet of Ministers had exercised the power vested

in them by Article 55 of the Constitution in good faith. The Cabinet of Ministers had exercised

that power in what they believed to be the best interests of the country as a whole. Therefore,

I conclude that the Cabinet of Ministers on 21-03-2017 had decided to absorb the Petitioners

to the posts in the Combined Service which would be similar to their present posts and to

transfer the Petitioners out of the Department of Motor Traffic as a matter of policy in terms

of the power vested in it by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution.

In the case of Abeywickrema Vs. Pathirana & others,1 delivering the majority judgment of

Court in 1986, Chief Justice Sharvananda interpreting Article 55(4) of 1978 Constitution as it

stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, went on to state in his judgment the

following;

Article 55(4) empowers the Cabinet of Ministers to make rules for all matters

relating to public officers, without impinging upon the overriding powers of pleasure

recognised under Article 55(1). Matters relating to 'public officer' comprehends all

matters relating to employment, which are incidental to employment and form part

of the terms and conditions of such employment, such as provisions as to salary,

increments, leave, gratuity, pension, and of superannuity, promotion and every

termination of employment and removal from service. The power conferred on the

1 1986 (1) Sri L. R. 120 at page 138.

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 40 of 41

Cabinet of Ministers is a power to make rules which are general in their operation

though they may be applied to a particular class of public officers. This power is a

legislative power and this rule making function is for the purpose identified in Article

55(4) of the Constitution as legislative not executive or judicial in character.

This Court cannot directly or indirectly assist to stop the remedial action taken by the Cabinet

of Ministers to avert serious acts of corruption taking place in the Department of Motor Traffic.

Such an action by this court would indeed negate the advancement of equal protection of law

principle enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Let me conclude this judgment citing the following passage from the judgment of Her Ladyship

Justice Shirani Bandaranayake (as she then was) in the case of Farook Vs Dharmaratne,

Chairman, Provincial Public Service Commission, Uva and others.2

The petitioner's relief sought from this Court is to declare that his transfer as

Principal of Pitarathmale No. 1 Tamil Vidyalaya, Haputale and the 6th

respondent's transfer as Principal of Sri Razick Fareed Maha Vidyalaya,

Bandarawela are null and void. In view of the forgoing analysis of the material

placed before this Court the petitioner has no right to be the Principal of Razick

Fareed Maha Vidyalaya as he has not got the requisite qualifications. However,

the petitioner quite clearly has sought to obtain relief on the basis of unequal

treatment. When a person does not possess the required qualifications that is

necessary for a particular position, would it be possible for him to obtain relief in

terms of a violation of his fundamental rights on the basis of unequal treatment

? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, it would mean that Article

12(1) of the Constitution would be applicable even in a situation where there is

no violation of the applicable legal procedure or the general practice. The

application of Article 12(1) of the Constitution cannot be used for such situations

as it provides to an aggrieved person only for the equal protection of the law

where the authorities have acted illegally or incorrectly without giving due

consideration to the applicable guidelines. Article 12(1) of the Constitution does

not provide for any situation where the authorities will have to act illegally. The

safeguard retained in Article 12(1) is for the performance of a lawful act and not

to be directed to carry out an illegal function. In order to succeed the petitioner

2 2005 (1) Sri L. R. 133 at page 140.

[SC FR 105/2017] Page 41 of 41

must be in a position to place material before this Court that there has been

unequal treatment within the framework of a lawful act.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, I conclude that there is no merit in this

Petition and the Petitioners are therefore not entitled to succeed with the prayers in their

Petition. Accordingly, I proceed to dismiss this Petition with costs.
