"I observe that the Cabinet of Ministers had taken this decision with a view to address serious"
"incidents of corruption prevailing in the Department of Motor Traffic. The Cabinet of Ministers"
"had not made this decision in a way  that it would treat several officers in a discriminatory"

"of the power vested in it by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution."
