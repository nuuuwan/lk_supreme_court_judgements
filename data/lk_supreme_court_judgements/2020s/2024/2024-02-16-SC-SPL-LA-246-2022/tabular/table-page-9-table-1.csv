"It is pertinent to note the stance taken by the Petitioner in relation to the application No.SC SPL"
"LA 218/2022. As per paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Petition, it has been dismissed since the  copy"
"filed in Court has not been duly certified by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal. Apparently, what"
"those  paragraphs  indicate  is  that  there  was  no  fault  on  the  part  of  the  Petitioner  but  the  copy"
"tendered was without the certification by the Registrar of Court of Appeal as to its authenticity."
"However, now both parties have tendered a copy of the said order in SC SPL LA 218/ 2022 with"
"their submissions- vide documents marked K1 and F.  The said order is quoted below."
"“This  application  was  taken  up  for  support  and  Mr.  Nagananda  Kodituwakku  commenced"
"supporting the application. However, this application is not in conformity with the Rules of the"
"Supreme  Court  particularly  a  certified  copy  of  the  judgment  which  is  been  impugned  in  these"
"proceedings  and  a  certified  copy  of  Court  of  Appeal  briefs  has  not  been  filed  along  with  the"
"Petition.  In  view  of  the  above,  this  application  is  dismissed  for  noncompliance  of  the  Supreme"
"Court Rules.”"
"Thus, it is clear that when the previous application was taken up for support for leave, there was"
"no  acceptable  copy  of  the  Judgment  and  proceedings  of  the  Court  below  produced  before  this"
"Court by the Petitioner. When a matter is fixed for support on an application of a Petitioner, it is"
"the duty of such Petitioner and his or her lawyers to be ready for support on the given date. If they"
"are not ready for some reasons, they must take steps prior to the date given for support to take it"
"out  from  the  support  list,  so  that  the  Court  could  allocate  that  time  for  another  litigant.  The"
"Petitioner in her written submissions attempts to  say that she reserved her right to file certified"
"copy of the record of the Court of Appeal as soon as the same was made available to her. To prove"
"such reservation of right, Petition of the said application or any motion filed in that application in"
"that  regard  or  any  journal  entry  proving  such reservation  of  right  has  not  been  tendered  by  the"
"Petitioner. On the other hand, even such reservation was prayed or granted, those documents which"
"were necessary to support the leave application should have been obtained prior to the support date"
"and,  for  some  reasons  beyond  the  control  of  the  Petitioner,  if  the  Petitioner  failed  to  obtain"
"necessary documents from the Court below, the Petitioner or her lawyer should have filed a motion"
"and informed the Court to take it out of the support list enabling the Court to allocate that time for"
"another  case.  The  order  quoted  above  clearly  indicates  that  the  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner"
"commenced  supporting  the  application  and  then  the  Court  found  that  no  acceptable  documents"
