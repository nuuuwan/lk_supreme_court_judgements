"SPL LA 218/2022 based on the reason that when it was taken up for support, it was found that the"
"application was not in compliance with the Supreme Court Rules; Particularly a certified copy of"
"the impugned Judgment and a certified copy of Court of Appeal brief had not been tendered with"
"the  Petition-  (see  order  marked  F  dated  02.09.2022  made  in  said  SC  SPL  LA  218/2022  and"
"Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Petitioner’s own petition referring to the said order). The Respondents"
"contend  that  the  right  to  file  a  Leave  to  Appeal  application  in  terms  of  Article  128(2)  of  the"
"Constitution has been duly exercised and due to its dismissal by this Court, the Petitioner’s right"
"to appeal has been exhausted. The Petitioner has not shown that when her previous application"
"was dismissed, this Court reserved her right to file a fresh application and the said order does not"
"indicate such right was reserved."
"Article 118(c) of the Constitution provides that, “The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka"
"shall be the highest and final superior Court of record in the Republic and shall subject to the"
"provisions of the Constitution exercise final appellate jurisdiction.” Further, Article 127 (1) of the"
"Constitution states, “The Supreme Court shall, subject to the Constitution, be the final Court of"
"civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction for and within the Republic of Sri Lanka for the correction"
"of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the Court of Appeal or any Court of"
"First Instance, tribunal or other institution and the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court"
"shall in all cases be final and conclusive in all such matters.” Thus, reading of Article 118 (c) and"
"127  (1)  clearly  indicate  that  the  decision  made  by  this  Court  in  a  final  appeal  is  final  and"
"conclusive."
"As  per  Article  128(1)  and  (2),  an  appeal  is  available  against  a  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"either  with  the  leave  granted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  or  when  special  leave  is  granted  by  the"
"Supreme Court. If such special leave is not granted by this Court, there is no provision that makes"
"a party empowered to file another or several applications praying for special leave over the same"
"decision of the Court of Appeal against the refusal made by this Court even though a Special Leave"
"to Appeal application can be filed when leave is refused by the Court of Appeal [see S C Rule"
"20(3) and Article 128(2)]. A right of appeal must be statutorily given. If that right is given with"
"leave that is to be obtained first from this Court, and if such leave is refused, the right of appeal"
"extinguishes with the said leave being refused. If such a right is considered as available to a party"
"to file Special Leave to Appeal one after another even after the leave being refused by this Court,"
