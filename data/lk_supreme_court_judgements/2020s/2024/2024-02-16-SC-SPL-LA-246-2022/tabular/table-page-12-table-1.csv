"application was filed. The Petitioner now takes up the position that SC FR 299/2022 had been filed"
"without her consent or authorization. Even if it is assumed that the Petitioner’s version that SC FR"
"299/2022  was  filed  without  her  consent  or  authorization,  she  could  have  revealed  that  such  an"
"action has been filed in her name but without her consent or authorization. This Court does not"
"intend to make any comment on whether her said version can be accepted at this juncture since"
"there seems to be certain complaints made against the relevant lawyers by the Petitioner and such"
"allegations  would  have  to  be  considered  and  decided  if  such  allegations  are  allowed  to  be"
"proceeded with- vide K3, K4, K5, K6. However, it appears that the lawyer for the Petitioner, on"
"30.09.2022 has asked time to obtain instruction with regard to the FR application and thereafter"
"has filed a motion dated 13.10.2022 along with an affidavit dated 04.10.2022 purportedly sworn"
"by the Petitioner- vide documents marked K8. In that motion or in the said affidavit, the Petitioner"
"or her lawyer had not said that institution of SC FR 299/2022 was not an act of the Petitioner. In"
"fact, the said motion by her lawyer admits that said FR action was filed and, in the affidavit, it is"
"stated why the said FR application was dismissed without resorting to say that filing of it was not"
"her act. Whatever it is, tendering of that motion dated 13.10.2022, was an act of her own lawyer"
"in this case."
"On the other hand, if the Petitioner’s present stance is correct, it is questionable without giving"
"instructions  by  the  Petitioner  about  the  facts,  how  the  lawyers  in  SC  FR  299/2022  drafted  the"
"petition in that fundamental right case. As per the written submissions tendered, the Petitioner now"
"states  that  she  has  never  met  and  gave  instructions  to  the  lawyers  involved  in  filing  of  SC  FR"
"299/2022. Anyhow, the same lawyer, namely Mr. Nagananda Kodituwakku, who tendered the said"
"motion dated 13.10.2022 along with the affidavit dated 04.10.2022 now tries to submit that said"
"affidavit is a forged affidavit- vide penultimate paragraph of page 4 of his written submission. In"
"that regard, he has now tendered an unsigned and unsworn “oral statement” and a soft copy of an"
"“oral submission” purportedly made by the Petitioner- marked as K9 and K10 with the written"
"submission. It appears that they were not tendered with the Petition for other parties to respond."
"After observing the change of stance, when queried by the Court, Mr. Nagananda Kodituwakku,"
"while making his oral submissions stated that SC FR No.299/2022 was filed without the consent"
"and knowledge of the Petitioner and she is not in a position to sign proxy. Therefore, he filed this"
"application as per the Rules as an Attorney-at-law and he takes the full responsibility of what is"
