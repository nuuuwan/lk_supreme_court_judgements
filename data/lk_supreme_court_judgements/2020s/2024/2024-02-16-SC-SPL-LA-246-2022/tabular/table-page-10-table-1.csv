"have been tendered to support the application. Thus, it appears that the dismissal of the previous"
"application was due to the fault of the Petitioner and her Lawyer to submit the necessary documents"
"for support of her application."
"On the other hand, if the order made was done by mistake when the certified or uncertified photo"
"copy was available in the brief as prescribed by the Rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules (1990),"
"that has to be moved in the same case by filing a motion and bringing the error or mistake of the"
"Court  to  the  attention  of  the  Court,  for  the  Court  to  consider  whether  the  order  was  made  per"
"incuriam or by obvious mistake. (However, the Petition or the attached documents of the previous"
"application for leave have not been tendered before this Court to see whether there was a possible"
"mistake.) If the order was given by mistake or by an error it will not give rise to another opportunity"
"to file a fresh application when the said order still exists as a valid order."
"However, what was discussed above clearly shows that the Petitioner has no right to file a second"
"Leave to Appeal application and to have a second bite of the same cherry and that she is guilty of"
"misrepresentation as there is no deportation order as such but a cancellation of visa and advise to"
"leave  the  Country  before  a  given  date.  Further,  she  has  not  revealed  sufficient  material  in  the"
"Petition to show that the refusal was not due to her or her lawyerâ€™s fault."
"As elaborated above, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the 2nd appeal on the same matter."
"Hence, this Court has to uphold the first ground of objection referred to above and it is sufficient"
"to dismiss this application."
"Since what is elaborated above is sufficient to dismiss this application, this Court does not intend"
"to  go  deep  into  the  other  grounds  of  objections.  However,  it  is  worthwhile  to  make  certain"
"observations in that regard too."
