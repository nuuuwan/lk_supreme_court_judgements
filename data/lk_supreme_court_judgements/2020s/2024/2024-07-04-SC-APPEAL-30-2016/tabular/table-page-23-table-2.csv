"Janeiro Declarations are not legally binding in the way in which an"
"Act of our Parliament would be. It may be regarded merely as ‘soft"
"law’. Nevertheless, as a Member of the United Nations, they could"
"hardly be ignored by Sri Lanka. Moreover, they would, in my view,"
"be binding if they have been either expressly enacted or become a"
"part of the domestic law by adoption by the superior Courts of record"
"and by the Supreme Court in particular, in their decisions."
