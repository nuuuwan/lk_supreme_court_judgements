"possession ut dominus is not necessarily required in Sri Lanka for"
"purposes of prescriptive possession”"
"In fact, when one claim prescriptive title to a right of way, he does not"
"challenge  or  claim  the  soil  rights  in  the  servient  tenement  but  claim  a"
"right  of  way  by  user  adverse  to  the  title  of  the  soil  right  owner  while"
"accepting the dominium of the owner."
"Unless it is clear that our legislature framed the provision based on the"
"concepts 
contained 
in 
the 
abolished 
law 
relating 
to 
acquisitive"
"prescription in Roman-Dutch Law or any foreign legal provisions, it is my"
"view  that  our  courts  should  interpret  our  provision  in  terms  of  the"
"terminology  contained 
in 
the  statute 
itself  using  rules  relating 
to"
"interpretation. 
In  this  regard, 
it  must  be  noted  that  our  statutory"
"provision does not refer to nec vi, nec clam, nec precario in describing the"
"nature of possession that is needed to established prescriptive title. Even"
"the 10-year period contained in Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance"
"is different from what was needed in terms of Roman-Dutch law which"
"was 1/3rd of a century."
"Thus,  in  the  above  backdrop,  I  prefer  to  look  at  the  issue  before  us,"
"namely  whether  the  3rd  Defendant-Appellant-Respondent  (hereinafter"
"3rd Defendant) acquired prescriptive title to Lot 1 of the preliminary plan"
"no.  661,  solely  within 
the  scope  of  Section  3  of 
the  Prescription"
"Ordinance."
"His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena in his draft Judgment appears to"
"have drawn a line separating violent possession and possession taken by"
"force from the scope of adverse possession contemplated in section 3 of"
"the Prescription Ordinance while, among other things, referring to Roman"
"Law and Roman-Dutch Law concepts. Fernando V Livera 49 N L R 350"
"referred  to  in  His  Lordship’s  draft  Judgment  and  Dawood  v  Natchiya"
