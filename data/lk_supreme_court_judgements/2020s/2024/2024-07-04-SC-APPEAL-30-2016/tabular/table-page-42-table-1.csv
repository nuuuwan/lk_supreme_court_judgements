"such case has to be considered on its own merits. On the other hand, if"
"every possible possession that can be termed as forcible possession from"
"the  viewpoint  of  opponent  to  the  claim  of  prescriptive  possession  is"
"excluded from the application of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance,"
"section  3  may  become  redundant.  Thus,  it  is  my  view  that  on  certain"
"occasions, 
limitation 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
adverse  possession"
"contemplated 
in  section  3  can  be  made  where  criminal  element 
is"
"involved in such adverse possession as it cannot be the intention of the"
"legislature  to  grant  title  to  land  based  on  possessions  tainted  with"
