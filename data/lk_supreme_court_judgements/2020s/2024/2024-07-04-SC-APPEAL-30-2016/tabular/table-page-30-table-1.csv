"Dr. Shirani Ponnambalam in the aforementioned article at pages 58-59"
"One may then justifiably query the objectives of policy in permitting"
"the usurpation of the ownerâ€™s rights on proof of wrongful possession."
"Perhaps the only plausible rationale would be the one founded on"
"the principle that the idle and slovenly owner who  sleeps over his"
"rights must bear the consequences of his negligence. This introduces"
"a punitive element and justifies a serious inroad on the inviolability"
"of ownership. In similar vein it may be asserted that the owner who"
"had full knowledge of an adverse claimant on his land and who took"
"no steps to safeguard his rights, though equipped to do so, in fact"
"consented to the deprivation of his rights in favour of the possessor."
"It must however be pointed out that although a rationale founded on"
"negligence  or  acquiescence  of  the  owner  might  have  had  some"
"justification in a bygone era, its relevance in a modern society where"
"absentee landlords is a common feature may be seriously doubted."
