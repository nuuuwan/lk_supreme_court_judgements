"In the South African case of Khatha v. Pillay and Others 2024 (1) SA 159"
"(GJ) Moultrie A.J. states at paragraph 28:"
"While  the  law  of  acquisitive  prescription  more  generally  has  been"
"justified on the basis of a range of moral or philosophical arguments,"
"[Pienaar v Rabie at 135H.] the two main justifications advanced in"
"South  African 
law 
(punishment  and 
legal  certainty) 
[EJ  Marais"
"Acquisitive Prescription in View of the Property Clause (LLD Thesis,"
"Stellenbosch, 2011) para 4.2.3.] have in common the fact that they"
"focus  on  the  value  of  the  doctrine  in  the  interests  of  the  broader"
"society, 
rather 
than  on 
the  narrow  personal 
interests  of 
the"
"possessor  seeking  to  rely  on  it.  Thus,  the  punishment  justification"
"emphasises that an owner’s “sloth and carelessness” could “injure"
"the  public  by  producing  in  the  commonwealth  uncertainty  as  to"
"ownerships,  a  host  of  lawsuits  which  may  last  forever  and  the"
"bewilderment  which 
is 
to  be  apprehended 
from  such 
things”."

"of third parties who may be affected by the question of ownership."
