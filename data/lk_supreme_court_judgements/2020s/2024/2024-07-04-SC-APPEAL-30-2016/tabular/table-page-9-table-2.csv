"the land and possesses the land cannot claim benefit of the law of"
"the land."
"Mere  possession  is  not  prescriptive  possession.  It  should  be  adverse"
"possession known to the real owner. Adverse possession should continue"
"uninterruptedly  for  10  years.  For  mere  possession  to  become  adverse"
"possession there should be an overt act for the real owner and the Court"
"to understand the starting point of prescriptive possession. It cannot be"
"done  stealthily.  The  10-year  period  begins  to  run  from  that  point,  not"
"from  the  mere  act  of  possession,  as  not  every  instance  of  possession"
"qualifies as prescriptive possession."
