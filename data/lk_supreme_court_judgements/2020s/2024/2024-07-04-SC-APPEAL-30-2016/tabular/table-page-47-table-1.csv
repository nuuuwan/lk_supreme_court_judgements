"possession.  When  a  possessor  enters  upon  the  premises  in  a  capacity"
"inconsistent  with  recognition  on  his  part  of 
the  owner’s 
title  and"
"commences  possession,  such  possession  is  ipso  facto  adverse  to  the"
"owner’s title.  Therefore, there was no need for a specific overt act to be"
"proved  by  the  3rd  Defendant.  As  per  section  3  of  the  Ordinance,  what"
"needs to be proved is undisturbed and uninterrupted possession adverse"
"to or independent of the opposite parties. The 3rd Defendant’s claim, if it"
"is true, was independent of the title of the Plaintiff or anyone claiming"
"through the same pedigree or chain of title shown by the Plaintiff. The 3rd"
"Defendant’s  possession  cannot  be  a  possession  exercised  in  secret  but"
"openly. That possession should be within the knowledge of the Plaintiff"
"and anyone who claim through the same chain of title as they were in the"
"possession  of  the  adjoining  lots  of  the  corpus.  I  stated  above  that  the"
"Section 3 should be looked into independent of the Roman-Dutch Law"
"Principles, anyhow, such open exercise of possession corresponds to the"
"elements in nec clam (not in secret) possession in Roman-Dutch Law. This"
"should  not  be  misunderstood  with  proposition  of  law  that  one  who"
"entered  into  possession  in  a  subordinate  character  or  in  a  manner"
"accepting the ownership of the true owner cannot put to an end to such"
"possession with a secret intention in his mind. There the possession may"
"be  open,  but 
it  commences 
in  a  subordinate  character  or  while"
"acknowledging the title of the true owner. In such an occasion even if the"
"possession is not in secret or done openly, the nature of the possession"
"has  to  be  changed  by  an  overt  act  to  claim  adverse  possession.  With"
"regard 
to 
permissive 
possession 
or 
possession 
that 
commences"
"acknowledging the title of the opposite party, nothing short of ouster or"
"something equivalent to ouster is needed to convert such possession to"
"an adverse possession - vide Corea V Iseris Appuhamy 15 N L R 65.)."
"In  the  matter  before  us  the  3rd  Defendant  or  his  predecessor  did  not"
"commence his possession in a subordinate character or as a co-owner."
