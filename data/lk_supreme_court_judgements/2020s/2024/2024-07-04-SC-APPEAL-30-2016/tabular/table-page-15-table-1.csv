"Voet’s  Commentary  on  Modes  of  Acquiring  Property,  Possession  and"
"Acquisitive Prescription [41.3.14] states at pages 269-270 as follows:"
"“Possessed  by  violence”  defined  –  On 
the  other  hand 
those"
"properties from which a person has been thrown out by force are not"
"to be classed as possessed by violence but only those of which the"
"possession has been seized by violence. So far is this so that, if Titius"
"has  thrown  me  out  by  violence,  but  has  not  seized  the  property,"
"while  Maevius  has 
laid  hands  on 
the  vacant  possession  and"
"transferred it to another, usucapion is not prevented. Although the"
"interdict based on force applies, because it is true that I have been"
"thrown out by force, nevertheless it is not true that possession has"
"also been taken by force."
