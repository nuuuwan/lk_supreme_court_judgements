"of the corpus on the date of the action. If he had been evicted before that"
"date,  he  can  claim  prescriptive 
title  based  on 
ten  years  adverse"
"possession of which the completion of ten years falls before the date of"
"such  eviction  but  no  one  else  should  have  acquired  prescriptive  title"
"during the time in between the day he lost his possession and the date of"
"filing  the  action.  What  I  want  to  stress  is  that,  the  party  claiming"
"prescriptive title has to prove that the adverse possession commenced on"
"a time 10 years prior to the date by which he claims prescriptive title and"
"it continued undisturbed and uninterrupted for those 10 years but proof"
"of an exact date or incident of commencement is not always necessary. If"
"one  comes 
to 
the  conclusion 
that  commencement  of  an  adverse"
"possession must be proved from an exact date and incident, a person in"
"the present generation may not be able to prove an adverse possession"
"that commenced during the previous generation or few generations before"
"due  to  the  non-availability  of  witnesses  and  available  evidence  has"
"become  hearsay. 
In 
this  regard, 
I  would  refer 
to 
the  decision 
in"
"Tillekeratne  v  Bastian 
(1918)  21  NLR  12,  where,  as  per 
the"
"circumstances of that case, it was held that the Court can presume the"
"adverse possession commenced on a date 10 years prior to the date of"
"action. This was a case when parties were originally co-owners, but the"
"Court  presumed  that  adverse  possession  through  ouster  would  have"
"taken place 10 years prior to the date of action."
"In  my  view,  the  10-year  prescriptive  period  contained  in  section  3  is  a"
"matter of policy. If certain types of possessions are excluded merely by"
"comparative analysis exceeding what is allowed by rules of interpretation,"
"it may affect the policy of the State. The Courts are there to interpret the"
"intention of the legislature and not to legislate according to the way they"
"think  what  should  be  the  law.  On  the  other  hand,  if  certain  types  of"
"possessors  are  excluded  exceeding  the  powers  given  to  Courts  and"
"exceeding  the 
limits  allowed  through  rules  of 
interpretations,  such"
