"Africa in Stoffberg NO and Others v. City of Cape Town [2019] ZASCA 70"
"at paragraph 14 in the following manner:"
"The meaning of these provisions is well established. The continuous"
"possession  required  by 
this  section 
is 
the  common 
law  civilis"
"possessio, that is, the physical detention of the thing (corpus) with"
"the 
intention  of  an  owner 
(animus  domini). 
In  addition, 
that"
"possession  must  be  nec  vi,  nec  clam,  nec  precario.  Nec  vi  means"
"peaceably.  Nec  precario  postulates  the  absence  of  a  grant  on  the"
"request  of  the  possessor.  Nec  clam  means  openly,  particularly  ‘so"
"patent that the owner, with the exercise of reasonable care, would"
"have observed it’."
