"Their Lordships are unable to doubt that the purpose—perhaps the"
"somewhat  ambitious  purpose—of  the  parenthetical  clause 
is  to"
"explain  the  character  of  the  possession  which, 
if  held  without"
"disturbance or interruption for ten years, will result in prescription."
"While,  however,  the  clause 
is  no  mere 
illustration, 
it 
is  not  so"
"completely  successful  an  attempt  to  achieve  the  “full  and  self-"
"contained  definition”  as  might  be  wished.  A  phrase  having  been"
"introduced and then defined, the definition prima facie must entirely"
"determine the application of the phrase; but the definition must itself"
"be interpreted before it is applied and interpreted, in case of doubt,"
"in  a  sense  appropriate  to  the  phrase  defined  and  to  the  general"
"purpose of the enactment."
