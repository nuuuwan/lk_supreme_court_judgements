"considers as honest, fair and equitable. The object of every legislation is to"
"advance  public  welfare.  Justice  and  reason  constitute  the  great  general"
"legislative 
intent 
in  every  piece  of 
legislation.  Consequently,  where"
"suggested  construction  operates  harshly,  ridiculously  or 
in  any  other"
"manner contrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and reason, in most"
"instances, it would seem that the apparent or suggested meaning of the"
"statute,  was  not  the  one  intended  by  the  law-makers.  In  the  absence  of"
"some  other  indication  that  the  harsh  or  ridiculous  effect  was  actually"

"having  a  deed  to  the  land,  without  any  criminal  intention  but  with  a"
"strong belief that he is the owner of the land, to protect his rights, may"
"use  force  not  to  allow  the  true  owner  to  enter  in  to  the  land.  The  true"
"owner  may  come  to  Courts  after  10  years 
from  that 
incident  and"
