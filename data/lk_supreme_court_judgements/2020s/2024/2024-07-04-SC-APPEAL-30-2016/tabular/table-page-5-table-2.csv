"Section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  which  describes  the  mode  of"
"acquisition of prescriptive title reads as follows:"
"Proof  of 
the  undisturbed  and  uninterrupted  possession  by  a"
"defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands"
"or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that"
"of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession"
"unaccompanied  by  payment  of  rent  or  produce,  or  performance  of"
"service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an"
"acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly"
"and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of"
"such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with"
"costs. And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action,"
"or  any  third  party  shall  intervene  in  any  action  for  the  purpose  of"
"being  quieted 
in  his  possession  of 
lands  or  other 
immovable"
"property,  or  to  prevent  encroachment  or  usurpation  thereof,  or  to"
"establish  his  claim  in  any  other  manner  to  such  land  or  other"
"property,  proof  of  such  undisturbed  and  uninterrupted  possession"
"as  herein  before  explained,  by  such  plaintiff  or  intervenient,  or  by"
"those  under  whom  he 
claims,  shall  entitle  such  plaintiff  or"
"intervenient to a decree in his favour with costs:"
"Provided  that  the  said  period  of  ten  years  shall  only  begin  to  run"
"against parties claiming estates in remainder or reversion from the"
"time when the parties so claiming acquired a right of possession to"
"the property in dispute."
