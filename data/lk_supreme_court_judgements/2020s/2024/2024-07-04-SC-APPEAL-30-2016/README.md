Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action seeking to partition Lot B of Plan No. 48A

dated 13.01.1962 between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant in equal

shares subject to the life interest of the 2nd defendant. The 3rd defendant

was made a party since he has encroached upon a portion of Lot B on

the western boundary.

After superimposition, the encroached portion was identified as Lot 1 in

the Preliminary Plan No. 661. The western boundary of Lot B is Lot G,

which was allotted to the 3rd defendants father in a previous partition

action. Lot B was allotted to the plaintiffs predecessor in title.

The 3rd defendant claims Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan by prescription.

On that basis, the 3rd defendant sought exclusion of Lot 1 from the land

to be partitioned.

The District Court refused the 3rd defendants claim. On appeal, the High

Court decided otherwise.

The question to be decided on this appeal is whether the High Court is

justified in overturning the District Courts decision and excluding Lot 1

from the corpus on the basis that the 3rd defendant acquired prescriptive

title to that portion.

The present owner of Lot G is the 3rd defendant. Since Lot G consists of

4 acres 3 roods and 39 perches, there is no necessity for the 3rd defendant

to encroach upon neighbours lands. When the case was pending in the

District Court, the 3rd defendant was a police officer.

The 3rd defendant admits that Lot B belongs to the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant on deeds. He also admits that Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan is

5

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

part of Lot B, for the partition of which the action was filed. Then the

burden shifts fairly and squarely to the 3rd defendant to prove by

affirmative evidence that he prescribed to Lot 1 in terms of section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance which describes the mode of

acquisition of prescriptive title reads as follows:

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a

defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands

or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that

of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of

service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly

and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of

such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with

costs. And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action,

or any third party shall intervene in any action for the purpose of

being quieted in his possession of lands or other immovable

property, or to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to

establish his claim in any other manner to such land or other

property, proof of such undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

as herein before explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient, or by

those under whom he claims, shall entitle such plaintiff or

intervenient to a decree in his favour with costs:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run

against parties claiming estates in remainder or reversion from the

time when the parties so claiming acquired a right of possession to

the property in dispute.

6

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Starting point of adverse possession

In order to succeed in his claim for prescriptive title, the 3rd defendant

inter alia needs to prove uninterrupted 10 years of adverse possession.

To calculate the period of 10 years, a starting point of adverse possession

must be identified. What is the starting point in this case?

The 3rd defendant is the adjoining owner. The 3rd defendants position is

that Lot 1 (land to be partitioned) was possessed as part of Lot G (his

land). This constitutes an encroachment on the land to be partitioned by

the 3rd defendant.

According to the final decree in the previous partition action marked P1,

after the scheme inquiry, the final partition was ordered on 19.12.1968

and the final decree of partition was signed by the judge on 21.01.1969.

In paragraphs 4 and 9 of his statement of claims, the 3rd defendant states

that after the final decree of partition, delivery of possession was not

effected through the fiscal, and therefore the parties possessed Lot B and

Lot G as they wished.

In paragraph 7 of the statement of claims the 3rd defendant states that

Lot G including Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan was fenced in 1970 whereas

in paragraph 9 he states that Lot 1 was fenced in 1976. These two

statements are irreconcilable.

The evidence of the 3rd defendant discloses a different story. According to

his evidence, the boundaries of the Lots were demarcated by the surveyor

and the fences were erected accordingly.

If this evidence is correct, the assertion of the 3rd defendant in the

statement of claims that the boundaries of the relevant Lots were not

demarcated but that they possessed the Lots as they pleased is false.

After the final decree of partition, if the surveyor showed the boundaries

and fences were erected accordingly, there was no room for the 3rd

defendant or his predecessor to fence Lot G including a portion of Lot B.

It can be inferred that the surveyor correctly demarcated and fixed the

boundaries of Lot B and Lot G.

The commencement of the 3rd defendants encroachment on Lot B and

the erection of a fence remain unclear. At the trial only the 3rd defendant

gave evidence to prove prescriptive title. The documentary evidence

marked by the 3rd defendant at the trial does not relate to Lot 1 but to

Lot G. There is no dispute that Lot G which lies outside the corpus

belongs to the 3rd defendant. Prescriptive possession cannot be upheld

unless there is sufficiency, clarity and unequivocality in the evidence

presented in support of such claim. There is no corresponding duty for

the plaintiff and the 1st defendant to prove that the 3rd defendant did not

prescribe to Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan. A person asserting adverse

possession has no equities in his favour. He alone must prove prescriptive

title with cogent evidence.

The plaintiff and the 1st defendant are residing on Lot B, the land to be

partitioned. According to Plan No. 48A marked P2, neither the 3rd

defendant nor his father was living on Lot G.

In the case of Punchiralage Keerala v. Dingiribanda

(SC/APPEAL/188/2011, SC Minutes of 18.07.2018), De Abrew J. states:

9

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

In fact when a person encroaches upon lands for which he has no

title, he acquires status of a trespasser in respect of the encroached

area of the land. Trespasser starts possessing lands for which he

has no title and continues to possess the land secretly. As I pointed

out earlier, to claim prescriptive title in terms of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance claimants possession should be an adverse

possession. A person who possesses a land with secret intention

cannot claim that his possession is an adverse possession.

Possession of a land by a person with secret intention cannot be

considered as an adverse possession in terms of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance. Thus a trespasser who violates the law of

the land and possesses the land cannot claim benefit of the law of

the land.

Mere possession is not prescriptive possession. It should be adverse

possession known to the real owner. Adverse possession should continue

uninterruptedly for 10 years. For mere possession to become adverse

possession there should be an overt act for the real owner and the Court

to understand the starting point of prescriptive possession. It cannot be

done stealthily. The 10-year period begins to run from that point, not

from the mere act of possession, as not every instance of possession

qualifies as prescriptive possession.

In the oft-quoted judgment in Chelliah v. Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR 337

Gratiaen J. states at 342:

Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant

to immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and squarely

on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights.

10

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

This was quoted with approval by G.P.S. De Silva C.J. in the leading case

of Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR 365 at 370.

However, as pointed out in Tillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12,

when it has been proved that undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

has persisted without an acknowledgment of the rights of the true owners

for a period as far back as reasonable memory reaches, it becomes

practically impossible to identify a starting point. In such instances, the

Court may, from the lapse of time in conjunction with the unique facts

and circumstances of the case, presume that adverse possession

commenced at some point beyond ten years before the action was

brought.

Although the above matters were rightly highlighted by the District Court

in its judgment to refuse the claim of the 3rd defendant, the High Court

has merely stated that the 3rd defendant has been in possession of Lot 1

from his parents time without adverting to the commencement of adverse

possession. The High Court states that when there is evidence that Lot 1

has been in possession from the 3rd defendants parents time, there is no

necessity to call further evidence to prove prescriptive possession. The

High Court has regarded mere possession as prescriptive possession. The

High Court has not appreciated that the onus of proof rests on the

defendant to prove prescriptive title by affirmative and cogent evidence.

The High Court is also incorrect in separating the claim of prescriptive

title from the exclusion of Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan, as the 3rd

defendant seeks exclusion of that Lot based on prescription.

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

.

In order to hold that the 3rd defendant has prescribed to Lot 1, the High

Court primarily relies on the report of the Preliminary Plan which states

that the plantation of Lot 1 was claimed by the 3rd defendant and that

the 3rd defendant was in possession of Lot 1 at the preliminary survey.

Prescription cannot be decided on that item of evidence. The surveyors

statement speaks of present possession, which is not the same as

prescriptive possession. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff admits that

Lot 1 is currently possessed by the 3rd defendant.

In the case of Siripala v. Jayathilake (SC/APPEAL/15/2010, SC Minutes

of 02.11.2015), De Abrew J. states:

A person who claims prescription can complain to the surveyor on

the day of the survey that he cultivated the land even if he had not

cultivated it. This claim is only the version of the complainant. This

type of claim cannot be considered as strong evidence to prove

undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possession. The son of the

Defendant-Respondent has stated in his evidence that his father

was in possession of the land for a long period. Apart from this

evidence there is no any other evidence. Mere statements of

witnesses that the Defendant-Respondent was in possession of the

land in dispute for over a period of ten years are not evidence of

uninterrupted, undisturbed and adverse possession. This was the

view expressed by G.P.S. De Silva C.J. in Sirajudeen Vs. Abbas.

Wrongful possession against the rightful owner

Although the High Court in its judgment makes references to long

possession and current possession, it has not made any reference to

12

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

adverse possession, which is a sine qua non to succeed on a plea of

prescriptive possession.

An owner of immovable property need not possess the land in order to

have his ownership to the property intact. By virtue of his ownership, he

has the inherent right to possess the property (jus possidendi), but there

is no legal obligation that the owner must possess the property. It is up

to the owner of the property to decide whether or not to possess the

property. The lack of physical possession by the owner does not authorise

others to seize possession of the property through illegal means including

violence.

The High Court found fault with the District Judge, alleging that the

District Judge had made efforts not to acknowledge the prescriptive title

of the 3rd defendant. This comment is unreasonable.

As Prof. G.L. Peiris states in his book The Law of Property in Sri Lanka

(1976), Vol 1, page 84:

Considerable circumspection is necessary in the recognition of a

prescriptive title, since its effect is to deprive of ownership the party

having paper title.

Prof. C.G. Weeramantry, An Invitation to the Law (1982), page 163 states:

Ownership, one of the most important legal concepts, is one of the

pillars on which the stability of society depends. On it rest interests

in land, shares in companies, money in the bank, and patent rights.

Without it ordered society breaks down and man reverts to a state

of lawlessness.

The paper title promotes stability, clarity and predictability in property

transactions. The prescriptive title commences and endures through

wrongful possession of the property of a rightful owner.

13

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

H.W. Ballantine, Title by Adverse Possession, (1918) Vol. 32(2) Harvard

Law Review, pages 135-159, makes the following observation at page 135:

Title by adverse possession sounds, at first blush, like title by theft

or robbery, a primitive method of acquiring land without paying for

it. When the novice is told that by the weight of authority not even

good faith is a requisite, the doctrine apparently affords an

anomalous instance of maturing a wrong into a right contrary to one

of the most fundamental axioms of the law.

Legal title and prescriptive title are fundamentally opposed or

incompatible concepts within the realm of property law. Possession is

never considered adverse if it can be referred to a lawful title. (Corea v.

Iseris Appuhamy (1911) 15 NLR 65 at 78) When the Court declares that

title by prescription is established, it transforms illegality into legality. As

stated by Udalagama J. in the Supreme Court case of Kiriamma v.

Podibanda [2005] BLR 9 at 11 title by prescription is an illegality made

legal due to the other party not taking action. This was quoted with

approval by Salam J. in Fathima Naseera v. Mohamed Haris

(CA/818/96(F), CA Minutes of 11.07.2012) and Chithrasiri J. in

Sumanawathie v. Sirisena (CA/830/98(F), CA Minutes of 10.03.2014).

Hence, prescriptive title should typically be viewed as an exception rather

than the norm, as encouraging prescriptive title may undermine the

integrity of property rights and legal certainty.

Codification of the law of prescription

It is settled law that, after the enactment of the Prescription Ordinance,

No. 22 of 1871, the law of prescription is solely governed by the

Prescription Ordinance, not by common law. The statute law and special

laws supersede the common law, with the latter only filling the gaps in

the absence of explicit provisions. However, having insight into the

14

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

historical background of the law of prescription is beneficial in

understanding the purpose of this legal concept and facilitating its

accurate application.

Justinian Institutes 2.6.7 (J.B. Moyles translation, 5th edn, Oxford

University Press, 1913), page 51 states the following with regard to

prescription (usucapion) in Roman law:

Usucapion of property classes among things immovable is an easier

matter; for it may easily happen that a man may, without violence,

obtain possession of land which owing to the absence of the

negligence of its owner, or to his having died and left no successor,

is presently possessed by no one. Now this man himself does not

possess in good faith, because he knows the land on which he has

seized is certainly not his own: but if he delivers it to another who

receives it in good faith, the latter can acquire it by long possession,

because it has neither been stolen nor violently possessed; for the

idea held by some ancients, that a piece of land or a place can be

stolen, has now been exploded, and imperial constitutions have been

enacted in the interests of persons possessing immovables, to the

effect that no one ought to be deprived of a thing of which he has

had long and unquestioned possession.

Justinian Institutes 2.6.2 (pages 50-51) states:

Things again of which the owner lost possession by theft, or

possession of which was gained by violence, cannot be acquired by

usucapion, even by a person who has possessed them in good faith

for the specified period: for stolen things are declared incapable of

usucapion by the statute of the Twelve Tables and by the lex Atinia,

and things taken with violence by the lex Julia et Plautia.

15

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Voets Commentary on Modes of Acquiring Property, Possession and

Acquisitive Prescription [41.3.14] states at pages 269-270 as follows:

Possessed by violence defined On the other hand those

properties from which a person has been thrown out by force are not

to be classed as possessed by violence but only those of which the

possession has been seized by violence. So far is this so that, if Titius

has thrown me out by violence, but has not seized the property,

while Maevius has laid hands on the vacant possession and

transferred it to another, usucapion is not prevented. Although the

interdict based on force applies, because it is true that I have been

thrown out by force, nevertheless it is not true that possession has

also been taken by force.

Possession, which is not peaceable, has been denounced in Roman law

and Roman Dutch law concept of prescription; Nec vi (without force or

peaceable), nec clam (without secrecy), nec precario (without permission)

are important elements in acquisition of prescriptive title.

In Perera v. Gunetilleke (1901) 5 NLR 210 at 216-217 Browne A.J. states

that a plaintiff, who merely abstained from possessing because he feared

a beating, cannot be said to have been ever evicted.

In terms of section 2 of the South African Prescription Act, No. 18 of 1943,

acquisitive prescription is the acquisition of ownership by the possession

of another persons movable or immovable property or the use of a

servitude in respect of immovable property, continuously for thirty years

nec vi, nec clam, nec precario.

Prescription Act, No. 68 of 1969 (South Africa), which repealed the 1943

Act states in section 1 that Subject to the provisions of this Chapter and

of Chapter IV, a person shall by prescription become the owner of a thing

which he has possessed openly and as if he were the owner thereof for an

16

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

uninterrupted period of thirty years or for a period which, together with

any periods for which such thing was so possessed by his predecessors in

title, constitutes an uninterrupted period of 30 years.

The meaning of the terms nec vi, nec clam, nec precario was revisited by

Van der Merwe J.A. on behalf of the Supreme Court of Appeal of South

Africa in Stoffberg NO and Others v. City of Cape Town [2019] ZASCA 70

at paragraph 14 in the following manner:

The meaning of these provisions is well established. The continuous

possession required by this section is the common law civilis

possessio, that is, the physical detention of the thing (corpus) with

the intention of an owner (animus domini). In addition, that

possession must be nec vi, nec clam, nec precario. Nec vi means

peaceably. Nec precario postulates the absence of a grant on the

request of the possessor. Nec clam means openly, particularly so

patent that the owner, with the exercise of reasonable care, would

have observed it.

Dr. Shirani Ponnambalam, Adverse PossessionA Basis for the

Acquisition of Title to Immoveable Property (1979) Colombo Law Review 57

states at pages 59-60:

The reasoning based on the culpability of the owner or his consent

to the loss of rights is further exemplified in the principle that a

clandestine possession cannot give rise to a prescriptive title.

Knowledge of the adverse possession is thus a sine qua non of this

rationale. It is therefore abundantly clear that the requisites of nec

vi and nec clam are consistent with and lend support to the basis of

prescription in Roman Dutch law. Welgemoed v. Coetzer (1946) TPD

720

17

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Although the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871 is in force today,

the law on this subject was first codified by Regulation No. 13 of 1822.

This was done not because the Roman Dutch law principles of

prescriptive title were considered unconscionable or inequitable, but

primarily to eliminate doubts regarding the prescriptive period for both

acquisitive and extinctive prescription. Additionally, it aimed to provide

clarity, certainty, and a legal framework for prescription. The Regulation

No. 13 of 1822 had 14 clauses. The preamble, the second and third

clauses which are directly relevant to acquisitive prescription read as

follows:

1. WHEREAS doubts have been entertained with respect to the periods

which shall be considered as prescribing against, or barring actions

for the recovery of Property movable or immovable, according to the

Laws now in force; And whereas it must tend to the Security of

property and the quieting of Titles to ascertain the same.

2. It is therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor in Council, that

from and after the First day of September now next ensuing, all

Laws heretofore enacted, or Customs existing with respect to the

acquiring of rights, or the barring of Civil actions by prescription,

within and for the Maritime Districts of this Island, shall cease to be

of any force or effect, and the same are hereby wholly repealed.

3. And it is further enacted, that from and after the date aforesaid,

proof of the undisturbed possession of Land or immovable property,

by a Title adverse to that of the Claimant or Plaintiff in any action,

for Ten years before the bringing of the action, shall entitle the

Defendant to a Sentence in his favour with Costs.

The rest essentially outlines the time periods within which causes of

action are prescribed.

18

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

The Regulation No. 13 of 1822 continued in force until Ordinance No. 8

of 1834 was passed. The Ordinance No. 8 of 1834 had 12 sections, and

the preamble of which read as follows:

WHEREAS it is expedient to amend and consolidate the Laws now

in force in the different parts of this Island, regulating the

prescription of actions, and to introduce one uniform rule of

limitation, for deciding the several periods within which actions at

law must be respectively brought throughout the Island and its

dependencies.

In Perera v. Ranatunge (1964) 66 NLR 337 at 339, Basnayake C.J. stated:

It is common ground that the Roman Dutch Law of acquisitive

prescription ceased to be in force after Regulation 13 of 1882 and

that the rights of the parties fall to be determined in accordance with

the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance. It is now settled law

that the Prescription Ordinance is the sole law governing the

acquisition of rights by virtue of adverse possession, and that the

common law of acquisitive prescription is no longer in force except as

respects the Crown. The question that arises in the instant case has

therefore to be decided by reference to that Ordinance. But it would

not be entirely irrelevant to add a word or two on the Roman Dutch

Law before examining the provisions of that Ordinance.

In the case of Adonis Fernando v. Livera (1948) 49 NLR 350, Basnayake

J. (as he then was) referred to nec vi, nec clam, nec precario in the proof

of acquisition of a servitude of a right of way by prescription.

Wimalachandra J. referred to these three requirements in Lowe v.

Dahanayake [2005] 2 Sri LR 413 at 417 as elements in establishing the

entitlement to a servitude through prescription.

19

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

In Hansawathie v. Karunaratne and Others (CA/DCF/524A/99, CA

Minutes of 08.02.2021), Ruwan Fernando J. stated at paragraph 102:

In short, the possession to become adverse, must be nec vi, nec clam,

nec precario, that is to say, the possession required must be

adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that

possession is adverse to the competitor (Secretary of State for India

v. Debendra Lal Khan (28) AIR 1934 PC 23). It is sufficient that

possession be overt and without any attempt at concealment so that

the person against whom time is running out, if he exercises due

vigilance, to be aware of what is happening (V. Muthiah Pillai v.

Vadambal, AIR 1986 Mad 106).

The issue involved in Abraham Silva v. Chandra Wimala (1959) 61 NLR

348 was also related to a claim of a right of way under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871. In this case also Basnayake C.J.

at pages 349-350 referred to the animus of using it as your own as of

right, not by mere force, not by stealth, and not as matter of favour, nec vi,

nec clam, nec precario.

The first question that has to be considered is whether the plaintiffs

are entitled to a decree in their favour under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance. That they and their predecessor, their

father, have used the right of way is not challenged in appeal. Does

user of a right of way constitute possession within the meaning of

that expression in section 3?

This very question arose for decision under the corresponding

provision of the repealed Prescription Ordinance, No.8 of 1834, in the

case of Ayanker Nager v. Sinatty [Ramanathan 1860-1862, p. 75]

and the Collective Court held that the word possession of

immovable property applied to the enjoyment of a right of way. It

20

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

defined possession when applied to a servitude such as jus

itineris, to be the exercise of jus in re, with the animus of using it as

your own as of right, not by mere force, not by stealth, and not as

matter of favour, nec vi, nec clam, nec precario. It also held that the

words of the Ordinance of 1834, which are in exactly the same terms

as the Prescription Ordinance of 1871 now in force, applied to

servitude of way, water, light and numerous others.

Prasanna Jayawardena J. in Priyangika Perera v. Gunasiri Perera

(SC/APPEAL/59/2012, SC Minutes of 18.01.2018) at page 13 states:

It seems to me that, the aforesaid requirements of use nec vi, nec

clam and nec precario of the Roman Dutch Law, when taken in their

totality, can be related to the requirements under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance of undisturbed and uninterrupted use which

is adverse to or independent of the owner of the land and without

acknowledging any right of the owner of the land over the use of that

right of way. It is perhaps that thinking which led Basnayake CJ to

state in FERNANDO vs. DE LIVERA [49 NLR 350 at p.352] that, a

plaintiff who claims a right of way by prescription must establish

use of the right of way nec vi, nec clam and nec precario and to cite

the aforesaid view of Voet [8.4.4], without expressly referring to

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, which stipulates the

requirements to be established, under our law, by a plaintiff who

claims a right of way by prescription.

Adverse possession is defined in the parenthetical clause associated with

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance of 1871 but it is not so completely

successful an attempt to achieve the full and self-contained definition as

might be wished. In this regard, the Privy Council in Cadija Umma v. Don

Manis Appu (1938) 40 NLR 392 at 396 stated:

21

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Their Lordships are unable to doubt that the purposeperhaps the

somewhat ambitious purposeof the parenthetical clause is to

explain the character of the possession which, if held without

disturbance or interruption for ten years, will result in prescription.

While, however, the clause is no mere illustration, it is not so

completely successful an attempt to achieve the full and self-

contained definition as might be wished. A phrase having been

introduced and then defined, the definition prima facie must entirely

determine the application of the phrase; but the definition must itself

be interpreted before it is applied and interpreted, in case of doubt,

in a sense appropriate to the phrase defined and to the general

purpose of the enactment.

Prescriptive title cannot be acquired by violence

There is another important matter I wish to address at this juncture.

Adverse possession is possession held in a character incompatible with

and in denial of the title of the true owner, but it cannot be equated with

possession through violence or force.

Violent possession cannot be legally recognised as a legitimate method of

acquiring property rights. It cannot be assumed that the legislature

intended to recognise violence as a means of acquiring title of others

property.

If adverse possession were to be interpreted as involving violence against

law-abiding citizens, it would promote the subculture of thuggery, chaos

and lawlessness, which neither the legislature nor the Court can

condone.

In my view, although Regulation No. 13 of 1822 wholly repealed

previous laws, the Court is not precluded from considering common law

principles or any other sources of law to interpret the law in a manner

22

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

acceptable to those for whom it is intended. The law is by the people for

the people, after all.

Right to property is a human right

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United

Nations General Assembly in 1948, stands as the first legal document to

define the fundamental human rights to be universally protected. This is

the foundation of international human rights law including human rights

conventions, treaties and other legal instruments. Fundamental rights

are a species of human rights. We are entitled to human rights by virtue

of being born as human beings. These rights are inherent and not

bestowed upon us by any entity, including the state.

Right to property is a human right. Article 17 of the Universal Declaration

of Human Rights (1948) declares:

1. Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in

association with others.

2. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.

Right to property as a human right encompasses both the right to own

property and the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of property.

It is the bounden duty of the Court to interpret the law in consonance

with justice, fairness and human rights.

The judgment of Sharvananda C.J. in Manawadu v. The Attorney-General

[1987] 2 Sri LR 30 provides a classic example. In that case, the

legislature, with bona fide intentions, sought to prevent the destruction

of forest reserves by amending section 40 of the Forest Ordinance

through Act No. 13 of 1982, which enabled the automatic confiscation of

the vehicle used in committing the forest offence, regardless of whether

the person convicted was the owner of the vehicle. Sharvananda C.J.

23

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

emphasised the importance of adhering to the principles of natural

justice, particularly audi alteram partem, stating that confiscation cannot

occur without affording a hearing to the owner of the vehicle. It was

highlighted that courts presume that the legislature does not intend

injustice and therefore should strive to avoid interpretations that lead to

or perpetuate injustice. The Court specifically referred to Article 17 of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognises the right to

own property and the right not to suffer arbitrary deprivation of property.

Hence His Lordship stated that the term forfeited should be interpreted

as liable to be forfeited. The legislature accepted this and amended the

section in line with the judgment.

This Court has time and again relied on international legal instruments

to interpret domestic law.

In Bulankuluma and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial

Development and Others [2000] 3 Sri LR 243, Amarasinghe J. referring to

the principles of the Stockholm Declaration (1972) and the Rio De Janeiro

Declaration (1992) regarding sustainable development stated at 274-275:

Admittedly, the principles set out in the Stockholm and Rio De

Janeiro Declarations are not legally binding in the way in which an

Act of our Parliament would be. It may be regarded merely as soft

law. Nevertheless, as a Member of the United Nations, they could

hardly be ignored by Sri Lanka. Moreover, they would, in my view,

be binding if they have been either expressly enacted or become a

part of the domestic law by adoption by the superior Courts of record

and by the Supreme Court in particular, in their decisions.

In Weerawansa v. The Attorney General and Others [2000] 1 Sri LR 387,

Mark Fernando J. emphasised that under Article 27(15) of the

Constitution, the judiciary as a branch of the State is under a duty to

24

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

consider international law when interpreting the domestic statutes.

Accordingly, it was held that the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary

Provisions) Act of 1979 should be interpreted in light of Article 9 of the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which

guarantees the freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention. His Lordship

held at 409:

Should this Court have regard to the provisions of the Covenant? I

think it must. Article 27(15) requires the State to endeavour to foster

respect for international law and treaty obligations in dealings

among nations. That implies that the State must likewise respect

international law and treaty obligations in its dealings with its own

citizens, particularly when their liberty is involved. The State must

afford to them the benefit of the safeguards which international law

recognises. In that background, it would be wrong to attribute to

Parliament an intention to disregard those safeguards.

Based on Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, several

other international legal instruments expressly recognise the right to own

property as a human right.

By Article 5(d)(v) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All

Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), state parties undertake to

guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or

national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, in the enjoyment of

the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.

All three major regional human rights conventions, namely, the

European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol No. 1 (1952); American

Convention on Human Rights (1969); African Charter on Human and

Peoples Rights (1981) also recognise the right to own property.

European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol No. 1, Article 1 states:

25

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of

his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except

in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by

law and by the general principles of international law.

American Convention on Human Rights, Article 21 states:

1. Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The

law may subordinate such use and enjoyment to the interest of

society.

2. No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just

compensation, for reasons of public utility or social interest, and in

the cases and according to the forms established by law.

3. Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be

prohibited by law.

African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 14 states:

The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached

upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the

community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate

laws.

Although adverse possession appears to be a private affair between two

individuals, the horizontal application of human rights recognises that

human rights can be infringed not only by executive and administrative

actions but also by the actions of private individuals. The horizontal

application of human rights refers to the idea that human rights

obligations extend not only to State actions (vertical application) but also

to the actions of private individuals and entities (horizontal application).

This concept imposes duties upon individuals and entities to promote

and protect human rights. (John H. Knox, Horizontal Human Rights Law

(2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 1).

26

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

The State is under a duty, on one hand, not to interfere with the rights of

citizens and, on the other, to protect those same rights from private

actors. After an exhaustive survey of authorities, Danwood Mzikenge

Chirwa, in the article The Doctrine of State Responsibility as a Potential

Means of Holding Private Actors Accountable for Human Rights (2004) 5

Melbourne Journal of International Law 1, comes to the following

conclusion in this regard at 13-14:

It can, therefore, be concluded that the duty of states to protect

individuals or groups from violations of their human rights by private

actors is well established in international law. This duty entails an

obligation to take such preventive measures as the enactment of

legislation, and the establishment of regulatory and monitoring

mechanisms aimed at preventing occurrences of human rights

violations in the private sphere. The state must also take reactive

measures once the violations have taken place. Most importantly,

these obligations do not only relate to civil and political rights they

are quite clearly also applicable to economic, social and cultural

rights.

As much as the State has a duty to prevent human rights violations by

private actors, the Court also has a similar duty. If the Courts were to

hold that forceful and violent possession falls within the ambit of adverse

possession under the Prescription Ordinance, it would be a stark

dereliction of that duty.

The rationale behind recognition of prescriptive title

The rationale behind prescriptive possession has been a topic of

discussion in various forums. The law of prescription operates against

slothful and indolent property owners, not against diligent and vigilant

27

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

owners who fervently seek to safeguard their property rights but are

unable to confront violence.

In the South African case of Khatha v. Pillay and Others 2024 (1) SA 159

(GJ) Moultrie A.J. states at paragraph 28:

While the law of acquisitive prescription more generally has been

justified on the basis of a range of moral or philosophical arguments,

[Pienaar v Rabie at 135H.] the two main justifications advanced in

South African law (punishment and legal certainty) [EJ Marais

Acquisitive Prescription in View of the Property Clause (LLD Thesis,

Stellenbosch, 2011) para 4.2.3.] have in common the fact that they

focus on the value of the doctrine in the interests of the broader

society, rather than on the narrow personal interests of the

possessor seeking to rely on it. Thus, the punishment justification

emphasises that an owners sloth and carelessness could injure

the public by producing in the commonwealth uncertainty as to

ownerships, a host of lawsuits which may last forever and the

bewilderment which is to be apprehended from such things.

[Johannes Voet Commentary on the Pandects (1698) 41.3.1 (Ganes

translation, vol. 6, Butterworth, 1957 at 258-259) See also

Maasdorp, AFS Institutes of South African law. 2 ed. Vol 2 (Juta,

1907) p 82.] The public element of the law of acquisitive prescription

also features centrally in the legal certainty justification preferred by

Professor de Wet in his memorandum, which refers to the interests

of third parties who may be affected by the question of ownership.

[JC de Wet Memorandum para 5, p 78.] Even in Roman Law,

prescription (usucapion) was regarded as having been introduced

for the public weal. [Digest 41.3.1: Gaius, Provincial Edict, book 21

(A Watson Digest of Justinian. Vol. 4, University of Pennsylvania,

1985 at 31)] More recently, the Constitutional Court has observed

28

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

(albeit in relation to extinctive prescription) that time limits play a

vital role in bringing certainty and stability to social and legal affairs

and are supportive of the rule of law. [RAF v. Mdeyide 2011 (2) SA

26 (CC); [2010] ZACC 18 para 8.]

In Voets Commentary on Modes of Acquiring Property, Possession and

Acquisitive Prescription [41:3:1], states at page 253:

[N]ay rather is the whole unfairness of this usucapion found merely

in the consciousness of him who exercises it that the property is

anothers, that is to say in his bad faith. Such bad faith was

tolerated for the benefit of the public welfare, and at the same time

as a penalty for a person who neglects what is his own, and shows

contempt by his negligence.

In Morkels Transport (Pty) Ltd v. Melrose Foods (Pty) Ltd 1972 (2) SA

464(W), Colman J. states at pages 477-478:

The requirement that the possession be adverse is of great

importance in the law of acquisitive prescription because it is one

aspect of that requirement which, more than anything else, ensures

that it is the idle and slovenly owner, and not one who is alert but

incapable of acting, who may lose his property by prescription.

Prof. C.G. Weeramantry, An Invitation to the Law, states at pages 164-

165:

The law needs even today to confer recognition on possession for a

number of reasons. Not the least of these are the disapproval of the

absentee landlord and the principle that people ought not to be

permitted to sleep over their rights. Consequently, when a person

with acknowledged legal title is away from his land and does not

assert title to it for a long period of time the person in occupation and

29

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

enjoyment during that period may have his possession ripening into

ownership through the principle of adverse possession or

prescriptive title. The period required for this varies in different

legal systems and may range from 10 to 30 years or more.

Such acquisition of rights by a non-owner requires adverse

possession on his part. This means that for the duration of his

possession he must not acknowledge title in the true owner. Hence

we have the result, somewhat strange to the non-lawyer, that a

spoliator or depredator sometimes fares better than the more law-

abiding occupier. The justifications for this are the larger policy

considerations set out above.

Therefore, in order to decide whether prescriptive title has been

established, it is necessary to consider whether the wrongful possession

of someone elses property continued due to the negligence of the true

owner or whether he was unable to assert his rights owing to the violent

conduct of the wrongful possessor. If it is the latter, the Court should not

validate prescriptive possession over legal title, as adverse possession is

not tantamount to violent possession. The Court cannot justifiably

condone the forcible usurpation of others property.

Prescriptive title in modern society

The retention of prescriptive title is justified from the standpoint of

maximising property usage, thereby benefiting the community at large. If

landowners fail to utilise their lands effectively, authorities should

consider introducing new legislation to address these issues, rather than

leaving them to be handled by individuals through aggressive and violent

means. The validity of prescriptive title in modern society has been

doubted by renowned academics.

30

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Dr. Shirani Ponnambalam in the aforementioned article at pages 58-59

opines:

One may then justifiably query the objectives of policy in permitting

the usurpation of the owners rights on proof of wrongful possession.

Perhaps the only plausible rationale would be the one founded on

the principle that the idle and slovenly owner who sleeps over his

rights must bear the consequences of his negligence. This introduces

a punitive element and justifies a serious inroad on the inviolability

of ownership. In similar vein it may be asserted that the owner who

had full knowledge of an adverse claimant on his land and who took

no steps to safeguard his rights, though equipped to do so, in fact

consented to the deprivation of his rights in favour of the possessor.

It must however be pointed out that although a rationale founded on

negligence or acquiescence of the owner might have had some

justification in a bygone era, its relevance in a modern society where

absentee landlords is a common feature may be seriously doubted.

Prof. G.L. Peiris, Possession and policy in a modern civil law system (1983)

Vol 16, The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern

Africa 291 at 316 acknowledges that The element of fault in the conduct

of an owner who has been remiss or negligent in the assertion of his rights

is entrenched in the foundations of the law of prescription.

Regarding the penal component of the law related to prescription that

it penalises an owner who has failed to protect his interests the author

states at 317:

The penal component of the law a recurring feature of the decided

cases has been persuasively assailed as inopportune in the

perspective of an urban industrial civilization: There may have been

some social justification for that approach in a village society where

31

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

it was easy for an owner to supervise and inspect his property,

though even there one might question the equity of favouring the

cynical usurper at the expense of one whose fault was not more than

idleness or negligence. In a modern society, where unimproved

property is frequently held for long periods by owners who live far

away, and sometimes even abroad, the social desirability of the rule

may be questioned. Morkels Transport (Ply) Ltd v. Melrose Foods

(Ply) Ltd 1972 2 SA 464 (WLD) at 468 per Colman J.

Given all considerations, including societal changes over time, I suggest

that the legislature consider making suitable changes to section 2 of the

Prescription Ordinance, including the extension of the prescriptive

period, the incorporation of a good faith requirement, and the recognition

of peaceable possession.

Conclusion

The question of proof of prescriptive title is primarily a question of fact.

The judgment of the District Court was delivered by the judge before

whom the evidence of the defendant who claims prescriptive title was led.

The defendant was the sole witness to prove prescription. Appellate

Courts should be slow to interfere with such findings of fact unless there

are compelling reasons to do so. In this case, I do not think that the High

Court should have interfered with the finding of the trial judge on the

question of prescriptive title.

In response to the main question of law, I hold that the High Court erred

both in fact and in law by concluding that the 3rd defendant had acquired

prescriptive rights to Lot 1, resulting in its exclusion from the corpus.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment of

the District Court. The 3rd defendant shall pay taxed costs of all three

courts to the plaintiff.

Judge of the Supreme Court

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J.

I agree.

Judge of the Supreme Court

E. A. G. R. Amarasekara, J.

I had the privilege of reading the draft judgment written by His Lordship

Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena. With all due respect to the views

expressed by His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena, as my views on

certain issues discussed in His Lordships judgment are different from

His Lordships views, I prefer to write a separate Judgment. As my brother

Judge has referred to the factual background in detail of the matter at

hand, I do not wish to repeat them unless it is necessary to mention them

to explain my views regarding the issues involved.

My brother Judge has considerably discussed various views expressed in

some text books and law reviews by legal luminaries such as Dr.

Weeramantry, Dr. Shirani Ponnambalam, Professor G.L Peiris etc. He has

also referred to certain legal concepts in Roman Law and Roman Dutch

Law and has quoted them from Justinian, Voet etc. Some of our case

laws as well as some South African case laws have also been referred in

support of the views expressed by His Lordship in his draft judgment.

While giving due considerations to such views, I would like to articulate

my opinion with regard to matters discussed by His Lordship and the

issue at hand as explained below in this separate judgment.

33

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

In my opinion, our law relating to Acquisitive Prescription is governed by

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance of 1871 (Hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Ordinance). It must be noted that the application of

Roman Dutch Law for Acquisition by Prescription in the maritime

provinces was abolished by Regulation No. 13 of 1822 which remained in

force until 1834. The Ordinance No. 8 of 1834 was enacted in 1834 and

it too was repealed by the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 which

was later amended by Ordinance No. 2 of 1889.1 Thus, today the law

governing the term of Prescription for immovable property is contained in

section 3 of Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 as amended by

Ordinance No. 2 of 1889 except for the property of the Crown. [In this

regard, see Terunnanse v Menike (1895) 1 NLR 200, Dabare v

Martelis Appu (1901) 5 NLR 210].

In Fernando v Wijesooriya et al (1947) 48 NLR 320, it was held that

The whole law of prescription is to be found in Ordinance No. 22 of 1871.

It is not necessary to prove that possessor had some title to the land at the

time of entry. The requirements known by the Roman law as Justa titulus

or Justa Causa need not be proved in Ceylon. (Also see Cadija Umma v

Don Manis Appu (1938) 40 NLR 392 where Privy Council appears to

have accepted the view that Law of Ceylon recognized no comparable

doctrine at the date of passing the Ordinance.)

In Perera v Ranatunge (1964) 66 NLR 337, it was stated that It is

common ground that the Roman Dutch Law of acquisitive prescription

ceased to be in force after Regulation No.13 of 1882 and the rights of

parties fall to be determined in accordance with the provisions of

Prescription Ordinance, it is now settled law that the Prescription

Ordinance is the sole law governing the acquisition of rights by virtue of

1 See The Law of Property in Sri Lanka- Vol 1, 2nd edition By G.L. Peiris pages 76 and 77

34

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

adverse possession, and the common law of acquisitive prescription is no

longer in force except as regard the crown.

Even W. Pereira, in his The Laws of Ceylon 2nd Edition 1913, p.384

states that the effect of the Ordinance is to sweep away all the Roman-

Dutch law relating to the acquisition of immovable property by

prescription except as regards to the property of the Crown.

Dawood v Natchiya (1955) 54 CLW 3 seems to be a decision that

favored the view that the Ordinance needs to be construed against the

background of the Roman Dutch Common Law and Roman Law

principles. It was held that to acquire title to immovable property by

possession for a period prescribed by law, it is necessary that the

possessor must honestly believe that he had a just cause of possession,

and must have been ignorant that what he possessed did belong to

another. In other words, possession will not enable the possessor to

acquire a prescriptive title after the effluxion of the period fixed by law

unless the possession is in good faith and is obtained nec vi (not violently)

nec clam (not by stealth), nec precario (not by sufferance). However, Prof.

G.L. Peiris in his book titled The Law of Property Vol. I (2nd edition) at

page 119 comments on the above view expressed in Dawood v Natchiya

as follows:

Plainly, this is an unsound view. The approach adopted by

Basnayake A.C.J (with Pulle J, agreeing) is irreconcilable with the

established principle that the whole of our law of prescription is

embodied in the Ordinance. Thus, in Ayanahamy v Silva2, Pereira

J. declared: We have to look for guidance within the four corners of

our own Ordinance relating to Prescription. In similar vein, in

Tillekeratne v Bastian3, Bertram C.J. said that The Roman and

2 17 NLR 123 3 21 NLR 12

35

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Roman-Dutch law are only of historical interest, as it is recognized

that our Prescription Ordinance constitutes a complete code: and

though no doubt, we have to consider any statutory enactments in

the light of the principles of the common law, it will be seen that the

terms of our own Ordinance are so positive that the principles of the

common law do not require to be taken into account.

It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the elements of the Roman-

Dutch Law governing prescription form no part of the law of Sri

Lanka, except so far as they receive expression in the terms of our

own Ordinance.

[Even though, Dawood V Natchiya (above) refers to the honest belief of

the possessor of a just cause of possession and his ignorance of the

owner, good faith and just title seem to have not been necessary

ingredients in Roman-Dutch Law for prescriptive possession but they

have been in Roman Law. See An Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law

R. W. Lee 5th Edition pages 140 to 142, and Elements of Roman Law

by the same Author 4th edition at pages 119 to 122]

In Wijesundera V Constantine Dasa (1987) 2 Sri L R 66, the Court of

Appeal expressly declined to follow Dawood V Natchiya as it does not

appear to be in accord with interpretation placed by our courts on the

provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

On the other hand, if the possessor has to be ignorant of the owner, it is

not clear how he can prove adverse possession against the owner. Proof

of adverse possession against the person who claim to be the true owner

is necessary in proving prescriptive title in our law4. In Sirajudeen V

Abbas (1994) 2 Sri L R 365, it was stated that a facile story of walking

4 See Fernando V Wijesooriya 48 N L R 320 and I. De Silva V Commissioner General of Inland Revenue 80 N L R 292 which indicate that adverse possession has to be proved against the title of the true or real owner.

36

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

into abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid constitute material

far too slender to found a claim based on prescriptive title.

There are few cases, such as Dawood V Natchiya referred above, where

our courts have referred to nec vi (peaceable or not by violence), nec clam

(open or not in secret), nec precario (not by sufferance or permission)

possession in relation to prescriptive possession which seem to be

necessary elements in proving prescriptive possession in Roman-Dutch

Law. It appears that in those decisions, it had not been considered that

from a time close to the passing of our Prescription Ordinance there are

series of decisions and opinions expressed by our courts and Authorities

that our Law of Prescription is wholly contained in the Prescription

Ordinance except with regard to the property of Crown.

Attempt to use laws in other legal systems or abolished laws to interpret

our statutory laws when the statutory provisions are not based on or

clearly influenced by such laws may give a different result than what was

intended by our legislature. Such attempts may not be a healthy practice

as in interpreting our laws in that manner may open gates to bring the

application of such laws in other jurisdiction to interpret our provision in

a manner that does not represent the intention of our legislature. For

example, the paragraph of South African case Stoffberg NO and Others

V City of Cape Town [2019] ZASCA 70 cited by my brother Judge

indicates that civilis possessio and possession with intention of an owner

is part of South African law but, in his book, Law of Property Volume

1, 2nd Edition at page 110, Professor G. L. Peiris, after referring to

several decisions, summarizes as follows;

Adverse possession was held at one time to entail possession ut

dominus, but this view has not found favour in several opinions by

the Privy Council, and it may now be taken for granted that

37

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

possession ut dominus is not necessarily required in Sri Lanka for

purposes of prescriptive possession

In fact, when one claim prescriptive title to a right of way, he does not

challenge or claim the soil rights in the servient tenement but claim a

right of way by user adverse to the title of the soil right owner while

accepting the dominium of the owner.

Unless it is clear that our legislature framed the provision based on the

concepts contained in the abolished law relating to acquisitive

prescription in Roman-Dutch Law or any foreign legal provisions, it is my

view that our courts should interpret our provision in terms of the

terminology contained in the statute itself using rules relating to

interpretation. In this regard, it must be noted that our statutory

provision does not refer to nec vi, nec clam, nec precario in describing the

nature of possession that is needed to established prescriptive title. Even

the 10-year period contained in Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance

is different from what was needed in terms of Roman-Dutch law which

was 1/3rd of a century.

Thus, in the above backdrop, I prefer to look at the issue before us,

namely whether the 3rd Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter

3rd Defendant) acquired prescriptive title to Lot 1 of the preliminary plan

no. 661, solely within the scope of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance.

His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena in his draft Judgment appears to

have drawn a line separating violent possession and possession taken by

force from the scope of adverse possession contemplated in section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance while, among other things, referring to Roman

Law and Roman-Dutch Law concepts. Fernando V Livera 49 N L R 350

referred to in His Lordships draft Judgment and Dawood v Natchiya

38

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

mentioned above seem to have not considered the series of decisions

some of which are referred to above which state that Roman Dutch Law

concepts are no more part of our law relating to acquisitive prescription

except for Crown lands and it is only section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance that applies. Priyangika Perera V Gunasiri Perera SC Appeal

59/2012 minutes of 18.01.2018 referred to in His Lordships draft

Judgment clearly identify with reference to previous case laws that it is

Prescription Ordinance that is applicable in deciding prescriptive title.

However, in relation to a submission made by a counsel relying on Roman

Dutch Law principles, in that case which involved a claim of right of way

by prescription, the learned Justice has also stated in relation to the

issues involved in that case that with regard to the requirement of use,

nec vi, nec clam and nec precario of the Roman Dutch Law, when taken

in their totality, can be related to the requirements under section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance. This statement has been made due to the fact

that the counsel had made certain submissions on that aspect, but it

seems such a conclusion was not absolutely necessary to decide the

claim of prescription in that case. Thus, it seems to be obiter. On the

other hand, nowhere in that judgment has it stated that such concepts

of Roman Dutch Law should decide the scope of the adverse possession

referred to in the said section 3. Perhaps the learned Justice who decided

that case would have seen certain similarities between the two systems.

As explained before, the use of the Roman-Dutch Law concepts to

interpret or demarcate the scope of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance is in conflict with the decisions that decided that the Law

relating to acquisitive prescription is wholly contained in the Prescription

Ordinance and Roman-Dutch law is not relevant except for the Crown

lands.

As explained above, the Prescription Ordinance cannot be considered as

a Statute that codified the Roman Dutch Law that existed prior to the

39

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

time of its enactment. Prior to the enactment of the Prescription

Ordinance, as stated above, the application of Roman Dutch Law to

prescription was abolished by Regulation No. 13 of 1822 except for the

Crown lands. As per section 2 of the Prescription Ordinance, rights of the

Crown are not affected by the Prescription Ordinance.

Even though, I am of the view, that acquisitive prescription should be

decided within the four corners of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, I observe that ideas similar to concepts of nec clam and nec

precario considered in Roman-Dutch Law, are inbred in our section 3. If

one commences the possession with permission (precario) his possession

cannot be an adverse possession to the title of the true owner as his

possession is subordinate to the title of the true owner; If his possession

is not in open but in secret (clam), in other words, if he possesses without

being subject to the knowledge of the true owner, he may not be able to

claim that his possession was against the title of the true owner. I do not

think that one can claim that he possessed adversely to the true owner

when his possession is not within the knowledge of the true owner. Such

possession to be adverse, has to be exercised openly against the rights of

the ownership of the true owner. The natural meaning of the two words

adverse possession indicates a possession incompatible, hostile,

unfavourable, harmful or work against the title of the true owner.

However, if one commences his possession by violent means or using

force, that possession from the inception becomes hostile to and

incompatible with the title of the true owner and it cannot be termed as

a possession that commenced with permission of the true owner or a

possession that commenced secretly. Thus, as Roman-Dutch law is not

considered as the basis of our acquisitive prescription, on the literal

construction of section 3, one may be able to argue firstly, that such a

possession, even though commenced through violence is adverse

40

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

possession to the title of the true owner, and secondly, if a Court

interprets section 3 to exclude such a possession from adverse

possession referred to in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, that

Court is indirectly inserting words in to that section to exclude such a

possession, which is not the task of the Court but of the Legislature.

However, this may pose the question whether the legislature intended to

grant prescriptive rights even to possessors who grabbed the property

through a criminal act and enjoy it against the will of the owner. It is also

observed that there is no bar to institute criminal action against a crime

even after 10 years.

It is true that it is the duty of the Court to interpret statutory provisions

giving the ordinary and natural meaning to the words, when they do not

contain words and phrases of technical legislation. However, in

interpreting in that manner if injustice or absurdity occurs, a Court can

presume that it was not the intention of the legislature to cause such

injustice or absurdity.

A statute which enacts that a person who has been convicted by justices

of an assault and has suffered the punishment awarded for it shall be

released from all other proceedings for the same cause would not be

construed as exempting him from prosecution for manslaughter if the party

assaulted afterwards died from the effects of the assault, as this would

defeat the ends of justice.5- vide Maxwell on The Interpretation of

Statutes, 12th Edition by P. St. J. Langan at page 209.

Bindra in Interpretation of Statutes, 13th Edition at page 57 referring

to Bhudan Singh V Nabi Bux, A I R 1970 SC 1880 quotes It is

necessary to mention that it is proper to assume that the law-makers who

are the representatives of the people enact laws which the society

5 R. V Morris (1867) L.R.1 C.C. 90

41

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

considers as honest, fair and equitable. The object of every legislation is to

advance public welfare. Justice and reason constitute the great general

legislative intent in every piece of legislation. Consequently, where

suggested construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in any other

manner contrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and reason, in most

instances, it would seem that the apparent or suggested meaning of the

statute, was not the one intended by the law-makers. In the absence of

some other indication that the harsh or ridiculous effect was actually

intended by the legislature, there is little reason to believe that it represents

the legislative intent

Bindra at page 249 also state that Notwithstanding all the care and

anxiety of the persons who frame Acts of Parliament to guard against every

event, it frequently turns out that certain cases were not foreseen.

Thus, I see the opportunity available for a Court to interpret section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance, even without the assistance of Roman Law

or Roman-Dutch Law concepts, to say that the adverse possession

contemplated therein does not include possession grabbed by violence as

it could not have been the intention of the law-makers to ignore a criminal

act by giving the perpetrator clear title to fruits of his crime and further

victimize the victim of the criminal act. However, I also observe that every

forcible possession that may be alleged before a Court adjudicating Civil

dispute may not comprise of a criminal element; For example, a possessor

having a deed to the land, without any criminal intention but with a

strong belief that he is the owner of the land, to protect his rights, may

use force not to allow the true owner to enter in to the land. The true

owner may come to Courts after 10 years from that incident and

thereafter may get an order that his deed is the valid deed or the one that

has the priority, but by the time of the filing of the action, the possessor

might have possessed the land adversely exceeding 10 years. Thus, each

42

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

such case has to be considered on its own merits. On the other hand, if

every possible possession that can be termed as forcible possession from

the viewpoint of opponent to the claim of prescriptive possession is

excluded from the application of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance,

section 3 may become redundant. Thus, it is my view that on certain

occasions, limitation to the interpretation of adverse possession

contemplated in section 3 can be made where criminal element is

involved in such adverse possession as it cannot be the intention of the

legislature to grant title to land based on possessions tainted with

criminal acts.

However, I must say that in the matter at hand, I do not see sufficient

material to say that the possession of the 3rd Defendant or his

predecessor commenced using any violence or force. As per the

paragraph 8 of the plaint dated and tendered to District Court on

02.06.1997(vide the date and the date stamp on the plaint), the Plaintiff

had stated that the 3rd Defendant on that date itself put up a fence

grabbing a part of the corpus by force. However, nothing is stated to show

how the 3rd Defendant used force. However, this statement indicates that

it happened prior to filing the plaint. As per the police complaint made at

2.30 pm on the same date the Plaint was filed, it is stated that after he

revealed to the 3rd Defendant that he had filed a partition action, the 3rd

Defendant was attempting to put up a fence. This indicates that if there

is a fence put up by the 3rd Defendant as referred to in the police

complaint, it came into existence only after the filing of the Plaint.

However, while giving evidence, the Plaintiff attempts to explain this

discrepancy by stating that he had only given instruction to file a plaint

by the time he informed the 3rd Defendant regarding the filing of a

partition action- vide page 50 of the brief. When one considers the time

that the police statement was recorded, it is highly unlikely that the Plaint

was drafted on the same date after the police complaint was made and

43

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

filed within the remaining time before the District Court was closed for

that date as there should be sufficient time to record the statement, to

meet the lawyer and to include the paragraph relating to the putting up

of the fence by the 3rd Defendant and to file it in the Court. It must be

noted that even at the time of recording the police complaint, the Plaintiff

was only aware of the 3rd Defendants attempt to put up a fence in the

morning- vide police complaint. This police complaint seems to be a

complaint made by the Plaintiff to correspond to the instruction given by

him to his lawyer to file a partition action. Even if it is a true complaint,

there is nothing mentioned in the police complaint about use of force or

violence. It could even have been that the 3rd Defendant put up a fence

on the boundary of what he used to possess. However, while giving

evidence at page 53 of the brief, the Plaintiff, contrary to what he has

stated in the Plaint and in the police complaint, attempts to state that

the 3rd Defendant, about 5 to 10 years prior to that date, grabbed a

portion by force when the 3rd Defendant was in police service but does

not explain how the force was used. Further, no police complaint

regarding that incident had been marked in evidence. Contrary to above

positions, again the Plaintiff in his evidence at page 58 of the brief admits

that from his parents time, the 3rd Defendant, unduly was in forcible

possession of a portion. Nothing is explained to understand why he called

it a forcible possession (see below in this judgment, the relevant

evidence is quoted). Mere words stating that it was forcible possession is

not sufficient to prove that there was a use of criminal force or violence.

On the other hand, the contradictory positions with regard to the date of

commencing forcible possession by the Plaintiff, make it difficult to rely

on his story of forcible possession. As stated above, I do not see any

material to indicate that any criminal element is involved in the alleged

possession of the 3rd Defendant.

44

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

As far as section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is concerned, a Court

can give a Judgment declaring prescriptive title only in favor of a person

who is a party to the action, namely in favor of a Plaintiff or a Defendant

or an intervenient in the action. (In this regard see Punchi Rala V Andris

Appuhami (1894) 3 S C R 149, Edwin Peeris V Kirilamaya 71 N L R

52, Terrunnanse V Menike 1 N L R 200, Timothy David V Ibrahim

13 N L R 318, Kirihamy Muhandirama V Dingiri Appu 6 N L R 197,

Raman Chetty et al V Mohideen 18 N L R 478 and M. Aludeniya V

Jayantha Karalliadde and others SC Appeal 30/ 2013 SC minutes

dated 03.10.2003) However, a party claiming prescriptive title may tack

on to the possession of his predecessors in title [See Terrunnanse V

Menike 1 N L R 200, Kirihamy Muhandirama V Dingiri Appu 6 N L

R 197, Wijesundera V Constantine Dasa (1987) 2 Sri L R 66,

Carolisappu V Anagihamy 51 N L R 355]. It must be noted that as per

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, a party claiming prescriptive title

to a land or immovable property has to prove ten years of undisturbed

and uninterrupted adverse possession previous to the bringing of such

action. Nevertheless, as per the proviso to section 3, this 10-year period

only begins to run against parties claiming estate in remainder or

reversion from the time when the parties so claiming acquire a right of

possession to the property in dispute. Even though, an exception to

section 3 is contained in section 13 of the Prescription Ordinance, since

that section is not relevant to the matter at hand, I do not intend to

discuss that exception contained in Section 13 in detail here.

The record shows that the Learned District Judge delivered the Judgment

in favor of the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants, rejecting the claim

of the 3rd Defendant which was based on Prescriptive title to the land.

However, the Learned High Court Judge held in favor of the 3rd Defendant

with regard to Lot 1 in preliminary plan no. 661 and excluded that Lot 1

from the final Partition. Learned District Judge was of the view that the

45

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

3rd Defendant failed in proving adverse possession as contemplated by

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance but the Learned High Court

Judges, on the evidence referred to in their Judgment, came to the

conclusion that the 3rd Defendant has established prescriptive title

through adverse possession to Lot 1 of the preliminary plan No 661.

However, neither the District Court nor the High Court has considered

whether the ten-year period could have been counted against the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant as there was an existing life interest in favour of

the 2nd Defendant.

My brother Judge, His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena in his draft

Judgment appears to have indicated that the 3rd Defendant failed to prove

an overt act to establish his adverse possession. I regret that I cannot

agree to this view as I do not see any need to prove a specific overt act by

the 3rd Defendant as per the stances taken by the parties in the action

before the original Court. Proof of a specific overt act is necessary only

when the party claiming prescriptive rights commenced its possession of

the property in a subordinate character such as a licensee or an agent or

when that party commenced possession in a manner not hostile to the

ownership of the opposite party; for example, when it was a co-ownership

or lease hold right or a relationship of a licensee or an agent with the

opposite party at the beginning. In such a situation, proof of an overt act

is necessary to show the change of the nature of possession. In other

words, it is necessary to manifest the intention to possess in another

capacity which is adverse to the title of the opposite party. This is

because, it is presumed that if a party commenced its possession in one

capacity, it continues to possess in the same capacity unless it is

distinctly proved that it changed the nature of its possession of the land

(See Corea V Iseris Appuhamy 15 N L R 65 and Tillekeratne v

Bastian 21 N L R 12). In the matter at hand, no party has taken up the

position that the 3rd Defendant is a co-owner or a lessee of the corpus to

46

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

be partitioned or that he commenced the possession in a subordinate

character or in a manner not hostile to the title of the true owner. Even

the position of the Plaintiff as per his plaint is that the 3rd Defendant,

after erecting a fence, is in forcible possession of a portion of the corpus

from 02.06.1997. The position of the 3rd Defendant seems to be, as there

was no execution of writ of possession in the previous partition action

where the predecessors in title of the parties in the present case were

parties, parties to that case separated their portions according to their

wishes, fenced and possessed. Thus, the 3rd Defendant and his

predecessor in title have been in possession of Lot 1 as their own along

with the Lot G given in the previous partition action to the predecessor

in title of the 3rd Defendant. However, it lacks clarity as to when they

started possession of Lot 1, whether it was immediately after the final

decree of the previous partition action or after 1970 or after 1977.

However, the possession of the 3rd Defendant of Lot 1 in the plan No.661

which is part of the corpus of the present action itself is incompatible

with the title of the Plaintiff or 1st or 2nd Defendant who claim rights

through the pedigree demonstrated in the Plaint as the 3rd Defendant is

not a co-owner as per the said pedigree or a person who commenced

possession in a subordinate character from a person mentioned in that

pedigree. Thus, after the previous partition decree, the possession of the

3rd Defendant and his Predecessors, if occurred in any part given to the

Predecessor of the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendant cannot be

considered as one done in secret but overtly and conspicuously. Being

the possessors of the adjoining land, Plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd Defendants

and their predecessor in title must be aware or had the opportunity to be

aware of the possession of the 3rd Defendant and his predecessor of part

of their land.

As per the decision in Tillekeratne V Bastian 21 N L R 12, possession

held in a character incompatible with the owners title is an adverse

47

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

possession. When a possessor enters upon the premises in a capacity

inconsistent with recognition on his part of the owners title and

commences possession, such possession is ipso facto adverse to the

owners title. Therefore, there was no need for a specific overt act to be

proved by the 3rd Defendant. As per section 3 of the Ordinance, what

needs to be proved is undisturbed and uninterrupted possession adverse

to or independent of the opposite parties. The 3rd Defendants claim, if it

is true, was independent of the title of the Plaintiff or anyone claiming

through the same pedigree or chain of title shown by the Plaintiff. The 3rd

Defendants possession cannot be a possession exercised in secret but

openly. That possession should be within the knowledge of the Plaintiff

and anyone who claim through the same chain of title as they were in the

possession of the adjoining lots of the corpus. I stated above that the

Section 3 should be looked into independent of the Roman-Dutch Law

Principles, anyhow, such open exercise of possession corresponds to the

elements in nec clam (not in secret) possession in Roman-Dutch Law. This

should not be misunderstood with proposition of law that one who

entered into possession in a subordinate character or in a manner

accepting the ownership of the true owner cannot put to an end to such

possession with a secret intention in his mind. There the possession may

be open, but it commences in a subordinate character or while

acknowledging the title of the true owner. In such an occasion even if the

possession is not in secret or done openly, the nature of the possession

has to be changed by an overt act to claim adverse possession. With

regard to permissive possession or possession that commences

acknowledging the title of the opposite party, nothing short of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster is needed to convert such possession to

an adverse possession - vide Corea V Iseris Appuhamy 15 N L R 65.).

In the matter before us the 3rd Defendant or his predecessor did not

commence his possession in a subordinate character or as a co-owner.

48

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

My brother Judge has referred to Punchiralage Keerala V W.M.

Dingiribanda SC/Appeal/188/2011 SC Minutes of 18.07.2018 which

says encroacher is a trespasser who possesses the land secretly and thus,

a person who possesses with a secret intention cannot claim prescriptive

title. The said statement that an encroacher possesses secretly may not

be applicable to every encroachment and it depends on the facts of each

case. If it is a small portion or a thin strip of land where the encroachment

is not easily visible to the opposite party, it may be correct. However, in

the matter at hand, the area concerned is about 20.44 perches. The true

owners are the possessors of the adjoining land who can see the 3rd

Defendant enjoying the area and thus, 3rd Defendants possession cannot

be termed as a possession in secret. In fact, as said before, the Plaintiff

once admitted in evidence that such possession was from his parents

time. Thus, the possession of the 3rd Defendant cannot be a secret

possession.

It is true that in Sirajudeen v Abbas (1994) 2 Sri L R 365, it was

indicated that there should be clear and specific evidence of the

commencement of adverse possession. In my view, this does not mean a

proof of exact date and time of the commencement of adverse possession.

As per section 3 what is necessary is to prove that the adverse possession

was commenced on a time or date 10 years previous to the date by which

the relevant party has made its claim for prescriptive title and it

continued undisturbed and uninterrupted for those 10 years. The date of

claiming prescriptive title may be the date of the action or a date prior to

that as our courts have decided that the term ten years previous to the

bringing that action contained in the said section 3 need not be the ten

years next or immediately before the bringing of the action (See Nager v

Sinatty 1860 Ramanathan Reports 75, Perera v Perera (1903) 7 NLR

173, Samara v Elias (1925) 25 NLR 427). Thus, the person who claims

prescriptive title based on adverse possession need not be in possession

49

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

of the corpus on the date of the action. If he had been evicted before that

date, he can claim prescriptive title based on ten years adverse

possession of which the completion of ten years falls before the date of

such eviction but no one else should have acquired prescriptive title

during the time in between the day he lost his possession and the date of

filing the action. What I want to stress is that, the party claiming

prescriptive title has to prove that the adverse possession commenced on

a time 10 years prior to the date by which he claims prescriptive title and

it continued undisturbed and uninterrupted for those 10 years but proof

of an exact date or incident of commencement is not always necessary. If

one comes to the conclusion that commencement of an adverse

possession must be proved from an exact date and incident, a person in

the present generation may not be able to prove an adverse possession

that commenced during the previous generation or few generations before

due to the non-availability of witnesses and available evidence has

become hearsay. In this regard, I would refer to the decision in

Tillekeratne v Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12, where, as per the

circumstances of that case, it was held that the Court can presume the

adverse possession commenced on a date 10 years prior to the date of

action. This was a case when parties were originally co-owners, but the

Court presumed that adverse possession through ouster would have

taken place 10 years prior to the date of action.

In my view, the 10-year prescriptive period contained in section 3 is a

matter of policy. If certain types of possessions are excluded merely by

comparative analysis exceeding what is allowed by rules of interpretation,

it may affect the policy of the State. The Courts are there to interpret the

intention of the legislature and not to legislate according to the way they

think what should be the law. On the other hand, if certain types of

possessors are excluded exceeding the powers given to Courts and

exceeding the limits allowed through rules of interpretations, such

50

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

possessors will not ever be able to get prescriptive title to the lands they

possess and, in anticipation of litigation from the true owners, they will

not take true interest to efficiently and expeditiously develop those lands

in their possession. If the true owners are also negligent and sleep over

their rights to possess their lands, such lands will not be developed and

it will affect the community at large. On the other hand, unscrupulous

owner may stay for a long period, until a person in possession of the land

develops it to enforce his rights.

It is true that prescription makes an illegality a legality. However,

prescriptive rights are accepted by legal systems not only to be punitive

towards a negligent true owner or holder of the paper title but, because

acceptance of prescriptive title is interrelated with public welfare as

development of land in a country is essential for the quality of life of the

citizenry. Even in the modern era where increasing population needs

housing and food, the legal system may have to recognize prescriptive

rights in the manner they were recognized it in the past, if the true owners

are not vigilant to protect their rights and use them to develop the lands

they own.

My brother Judge has suggested an extension of the prescriptive period

against the 10 years as contemplated in section 3. It must be noted as

per the proviso to section 3, time will not run against parties claiming

estates in remainder or reversion, and as per section 13, there are further

limitations on running of time against a person having certain disabilities

such as infancy, idiocy, unsoundness of mind, lunacy and absence

beyond the seas. The said ten-year period also does not apply to the

Crown lands which represent the greater share of the land mass in Sri

Lanka. In the above backdrop, if the true owner is not vigilant or showing

due diligence to protect his rights relating to the land for ten years using

available legal remedies, is there any wrong in giving clear title to the

51

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

person exercising adverse possession as it is interrelated to the

productive use of the land in the country? It is a policy matter to be

considered through legislation after studying the effect of extension of

prescriptive period over the productive use of lands in the country by the

Legislature.

His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena has correctly demonstrated the

Human Rights aspect of the property rights. I do not have anything

against considering Human Rights aspect in interpreting section 3 to

exclude possession taken through criminal acts from adverse possession

contemplated in section 3. What I observe is that, even Socio- Economic

and Political Systems that recognize private ownership of immovable

property including land, have sometimes introduced various limitations

on these rights, for the welfare of the masses (For example, ceiling of

property ownership). As explained before, the law relating to Prescription

may reflect the policy of the State that relates to the welfare of the Public.

On the other hand, most of the litigations may have some Human Rights

aspect linked with the issues involved in those cases. Some may relate to

serious violation of human dignity and freedom but due to other policy

considerations, the Legislature has provided lesser time to institute

litigations. For example, for violation of Fundamental Rights, our law

provides only a one months period to initiate proceedings- vide Article

126 of the Constitution. A torture victim, who wishes to file a Civil Action

against the perpetrator for damages regarding an injury caused by the

torturous acts, has to file it within the shorter time limit prescribed by

the Prescription Ordinance.

For the reasons set out above, I prefer to avoid myself getting involved in

the suggestion to extend the time.

52

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

However, in view of the matters discussed earlier in this judgment, I am

of the view that, in deciding whether one has prescribed to a land, a Court

must look only at the parameters and requirements found in the

Prescription Ordinance using its powers to interpret law in accordance

with rules of interpretation, and no other.

Now, I prefer to consider the factual circumstances relating to the matter

at hand to see whether the learned High Court Judges erred in holding

that the 3rd Defendant had acquired prescriptive title against the Plaintiff,

1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant.

As explained before, there was no need to prove an overt act by the 3rd

Defendant as he was not a person claiming through the pedigree

presented by the Plaintiff as a co-owner or a person commenced

possession in a subordinate nature, such as of a licensee, lessee or agent

etc. I have already expressed my views with regard to the credibility of

the story of the Plaintiff as to the date of encroachment and the police

complaint made in that regard by the Plaintiff. Whatever it is, the original

position of the Plaintiff seems to be that the encroachment took place

only on the date of the Plaint as per his plaint and the police complaint.

The 3rd Defendants position is that from the time of his predecessor in

title (his father) they were in the possession of the portion identified as

Lot 1 in the preliminary plan No.661 along with the Lot G of Plan No.48A

of D.L. Peiris L.S which his father got from the previous partition action

No. 7138. However, as explained above there is lack of clarity as to the

exact time of commencement of this possession.

As per the report of the Preliminary Plan No.661 marked X1, the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant have claimed the plantation in Lot 2 and 3

respectively but have not claimed the plantation in Lot 1. If they

possessed the plantation in Lot 1 or their predecessors planted them,

there is no reason for them to not claim the plantation in Lot 1 in the

53

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

same manner they claimed plantation in Lot 2 and 3. Only the 3rd

Defendant claimed plantation in Lot 1 before the surveyor without any

cross claim during the preliminary survey. The Plaintiff, 1st,2nd and 3rd

Defendants were present before the surveyor when the surveyor did the

preliminary survey. Even though the Plaintiff in his evidence sometimes

has attempted to indicate that plantation in Lot 1 was theirs and they

possessed it, it clearly seems to be an afterthought since if it was so, they

would have claimed it before the surveyor in the same manner they

claimed the plantation in Lot 2 and 3. Some of the plantation claimed by

the 3rd Defendant was 25 to 30 years old at the date of the survey. This

supports the position that if there was an encroachment, it took place

not on the day alleged fence was erected, but 25 to 30 years before the

preliminary survey. Date of survey is 23.03.2003 and thus, as per the

age of the trees in Lot 1 of said report, any encroachment could have

occurred in or around 1978 or before that. The Plaint was filed in 1997.

Furthermore, as per the said report of the surveyor, the western

boundary had been shown by the Plaintiff according to his knowledge,

and the Plaintiff had stated that the barbed wire fence is not the correct

boundary. The western boundary shown by the Plaintiff is shown on the

plan as an undefined boundary indicated by a black line. The correct

western boundary has been identified by the surveyor by superimposition

of plan No. 48A and indicated by red lines in the plan. (It must be noted

here that in the written submissions filed on behalf of the Plaintiff it is

misleadingly and incorrectly quoted that the boundary shown in red is

the boundary shown by the Plaintiff vide paragraph (42) (a) of the

written submissions tendered on 25.01.2017). What is in red line are the

boundaries found by the superimposition. The relevant paragraph of the

X1 report is quoted below.

The above quoted portion of the report indicates that the Plaintiff did not

know the western boundary properly and any other party standing with

the Plaintiff had not indicated a different western boundary. It is only

through the superimposition that the correct western boundary was

identified. It must be also noted that except for the slight discrepancy

towards the northern part, there is not much of a difference between the

boundary shown by the Plaintiff and the existed barbed wire fence with

some posts. It is very much clear that the greater part of Lot 1 was found

only through the superimposition and it was beyond the boundary shown

by the Plaintiff. This shows that the Plaintiff or any party standing with

him did not know that part identified by the superimposition was part of

the corpus until the superimposition. However, if they were vigilant after

the final survey of the previous partition action, they should have known

the correct boundary prior to the superimposition. This does not mean

that their predecessor being a party to the previous partition action could

not have known the correct boundary. This situation explains why there

was no claim to the plantation in Lot 1 during the survey by the Plaintiff

and others standing with the Plaintiff. If it was an encroachment

happened on the date of the Plaint disturbing their possession up to that

time, the Plaintiff or others standing with him should have known the

correct boundary and shown it to the surveyor. The barbed wire fence

shown on the plan has to be the one the Plaintiff has attempted to allege

55

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

as the one that the 3rd Defendant put up on the date of the Plaint.

Whether it was erected on that date or not, the plan and the report clearly

indicate that the Plaintiff and the others standing with him did not know

the correct western boundary and that, if there was any encroachment

that would have taken place many years ago which may be prior to 1978.

The above facts emanating from the preliminary plan and report, and the

claim by the 3rd Defendant of the plantation within Lot 1 without any

cross claim indicates that on balance of probability that it should be the

3rd Defendant and his predecessors in title who had the possession of Lot

1 for such period. It cannot be a possession in secret but one in open as

the Plaintiff and others claiming through the same pedigree and their

predecessors were the possessors of the adjoining land.

The preliminary plan and report are evidence as per section 18(2) of the

Partition Law. No one has taken steps to summon the surveyor to give

evidence if there was anything to be clarified. No party has taken steps

to challenge it in terms of the proviso to section 18 (2) or section 18(3).

Thus, the said plan and the report contained unchallenged evidence. As

said before, if the 3rd Defendant and his predecessors in title were in

possession of Lot 1, it could not have been compatible with the title of the

Plaintiff or person claiming through the same pedigree and chain of title,

namely the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

The preliminary plan and report were not the only evidence available with

regard to adverse possession. The 3rd Defendants stance itself was that

he and his predecessors in title were in adverse possession of Lot 1 which

is supported by the evidence revealed through the said plan and report.

Lack of clarity as to the time of commencement of such adverse

possession and its effect on 3rd Defendants claim of prescriptive title will

be dealt later in this Judgment. What is more important is that even the

Plaintiff admits that the 3rd Defendant and his predecessors in title were

56

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

in possession from the time of his parents. I prefer to quote the following

parts of the Plaintiffs evidence in this regard;

The above clearly indicates that the possession of the disputed portion

was from the time of the parents of the Plaintiff and it was incompatible

with title of the Plaintiff and his predecessors, making it an adverse

possession. The expression from the time of the parents of the Plaintiff

naturally means the time those parents held title to the corpus. It was in

March 1981 that the father of the Plaintiff, Piyadasa conveyed his title to

the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant subject to the life interest of the 2nd

Defendant. - vide deed No. 138 marked P4 at the trial. Thus, even the

Plaintiff admitted in his evidence that the possession of the 3rd Defendant

and his predecessors in title commenced prior to 1981. The action in the

District Court was filed only in 1997. The Plaintiff in his evidence

sometimes has stated that he and his predecessors were in possession of

57

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Lot 1 but as I mentioned before this seems to be an afterthought because,

if it was the correct position he or others claiming through the same

pedigree and chain of title naturally would have claimed plantation in

Lot 1 in the same manner they claimed plantation in other lots and would

have been able to show the correct western boundary more accurately to

include Lot 1 of the corpus without leaving it to be identified by a

superimposition.

As explained above, in my view, there was sufficient evidence to establish

adverse possession that commenced from a point 10 years prior to the

filing of action if the time can be considered as had run against the

Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant since the 3rd Defendants

possession is neither of a subordinate in nature nor one commenced

admitting the title of the Plaintiff and others as co-owners. As far as the

2nd Defendant is concerned, there is no bar in terms of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance to consider that time had run against her rights

as she held only a life interest but as far as the Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant are concerned, their rights were subject to the life interest of

the 2nd Defendant. Thus, each of them has only right in remainder. As

per the said section 3, time will not run against the remaindermen until

they get the right to possess. Even at the time of filing the action, the

rights of the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant were subject to the life interest

of the 2nd Defendant. Even their prayers were to grant relief prayed for

subject to that life interest. Thus, if they enjoy or possess parts of the

corpus, in law it was not as of a right but with the blessings of the 2nd

Defendant who has the life interest over the property. In the above

backdrop, I cannot fully concur with the conclusion of the learned High

Court Judges but can agree to the extent that the 3rd Defendant has

prescribed only to the rights of the 2nd Defendant as there is sufficient

evidence, including the evidence of the Plaintiff quoted above, to prove

that adverse possession commenced 10 years prior to the filing of action

58

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

and commenced till the action was filed. However, I am unable to agree

that the 3rd Defendant has established his prescriptive title against the

Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant due to the reasons mentioned below;

As mentioned before, in terms of Section 3 of the Ordinance only a party

to the action can claim prescriptive title. The 3rd Defendant got his rights

from his father by deed No.486 dated 19.11.1986. Even though his

stance is that he and his predecessors in title possessed the Lot 1 in

preliminary plan along with Lot G of plan No. 48A which was given to his

predecessor in title in a previous partition action, he cannot get a decree

based on prescriptive title in his name stating that he prescribed to Lot 1

prior to the date of the deed even he tacked on to his predecessors

possession. By the time he got the possession of Lot 1 along with

aforesaid Lot G from his predecessor in title, the corpus had been

transferred to the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant subject to the aforesaid

life interest. As such, the time cannot start to run against the rights of

the remaindermen in favour of the 3rd Defendant since by the time he

came to possession and can claim prescriptive title, the Plaintiff and the

1st Defendant have become remaindermen subject to the aforesaid life

interest. If the 3rd Defendant can obtain a declaration that his father

(predecessor in title) acquired prescriptive title prior to the date the

Plaintiff, and the 1st Defendant were given rights to the corpus subject to

the said life interest by said deed no. 138 in 1981, and therefore, the said

deed could not have conveyed any title or rights to the donees of the said

deed to Lot 1, there could have been a case for the 3rd Defendant against

the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. However, as said before, Section 3 of

the Ordinance does not provide to make a declaration of title based on

prescription in favour of a person who is not a party to the action. (In this

regard, see the recent decision M. Aludeniya V Jayantha Karalliadde

SC Appeal No.30/ 2013 SC Minuets dated 03/10/2023).

59

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Even for the sake of argument, if one argues that, even if no declaration

of prescriptive title is prayed on behalf of the predecessor in title and/or

no such stance is taken and/or no such relief can be given as aforesaid,

the Court can come to such a finding on evidence and give the benefit to

the present claimant of prescriptive title, as far as the matter at hand is

concerned, there is no clear evidence to establish that predecessor in title

of the 3rd Defendant could have acquired prescriptive title prior to the

execution of deed No. 138 which granted rights to the Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant subject to life interest in March 1981. For that, there should

be clear evidence that the predecessor in title of the 3rd Defendant

commenced adverse possession prior to March 1971. The final scheme of

partition of the previous partition case was approved on 19.12.1968 and

the decree was entered on 21.01.1969, but there is no clear evidence that

the predecessor in title commenced adverse possession from those dates

even though it appears that the 3rd Defendant sometimes has attempted

to give such an impression through his evidence saying that after the

final scheme of partition of the previous partition case, parties started to

possess as per the demarcation done by the commissioner of the previous

partition action. If this is correct, his position that Lot 1 of the corpus

was enjoyed as part of Lot G of the previous partition plan cannot be true

as there cannot be any doubt as to the clarity of the boundaries. As my

brother Judge has correctly observed paragraph 7 and 9 of the statement

of claim of the 3rd Defendant are contradictory as one paragraph implies

that the possession commenced in 1970 and the other implies it was in

1976. If it was 1976, 10 years could not have been completed by March

1981 when the rights were given to the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant

subject to life interest. Due to these contradictory positions, there is no

clear evidence to hold that the predecessor in title commenced adverse

possession 10 years prior to the date of the deed giving rights to the

Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant subject to life interest. The Plaintiffs above

admission while giving evidence that it was during the time of his

60

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

parents could be any date even very close to the date of the said deed.

Age of the trees in Lot 1, for which there was no cross claim as per the

report marked X1, by maximum, can indicate a possession commenced

in 1973. Thus, there was no clear evidence to say that the predecessors

in title of the 3rd Defendant commenced adverse possession 10 years prior

to the execution of deed which gave rights to the Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant subject to life interest. Thus, the one who held the paper title

to the corpus had conveyed his title validly to the Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant in 1981 subject to the life interest of the 2nd Defendant. As

explained above, time cannot run against remaindermen in terms of

section 3 of the Ordinance.

For the forgoing reasons, it is my view that the learned High Court Judges

erred in stating that the 3rd Defendant has established prescriptive title

over the rights of the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant as their entitlements

are right in remainder even at the date of institution of the present

partition action against which the time cannot run.

As per the amendment made to the Partition law by Act No. 17 of 1997,

a person, whose ownership is subject to a life interest, has been made

eligible to file a partition action. Therefore, the Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant are entitled to share each of the corpus and eligible to get a

partition decree in their favour. However, it is subject to the life interest

of the 2nd Defendant except the area covered by Lot 1 in preliminary plan.

As far as the area covered by Lot 1 is concerned, since the 3rd Defendant

has prescriptive title over the life interest of the 2nd Defendant, 3rd

Defendant is entitled to possess and enjoy it until 2nd Defendant lives.

The Judgments of the learned High Court Judges and the learned District

Judge have to be amended accordingly. Thus, the Appeal has to be partly

allowed with no costs.

Thus, I answer the questions of law in the following manner;

61

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Q. In considering that the 3rd Defendant/Appellant/Respondent has

prescribed to the disputed Lot 1, their Lordships of the Civil Appellate

High Court have failed to apply the requisite criteria and standard for

establishing prescriptive rights as laid down in sec.3, Prescription

Ordinance and trite legal authorities such as Sirajudeen and Two others

V Abbas (1994) 2 Sri L R 365?

A. Yes, the learned High Court Judges failed to apply the requisite criteria

in certain aspects as explained above in my Judgment, namely the

proviso to Section 3, but not specifically the decision of Sirajudeen and

Two Others v Abbas

Q. Their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court have completely

failed to consider whether the 3rd Defendant /Appellant/ Respondent has

established the ingredients necessary to constitute adverse possession

which is an essential element to constitute prescriptive title as set out in

Sec.3, Prescription Ordinance?

A. No, but as explained above, the learned High Court Judges failed to

consider the proviso to Section 3 in relation to the facts of the case before

them.

Q. Their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court have seriously

misdirected by setting aside the well-reasoned finding of the learned

District Judge that the survey plan (X) and report (X1) heavily relied on

by the 3rd Defendant/Appellant/Respondent, did not prove his

prescriptive possession of the Dispute?

A. No, but they erred in not considering the proviso to section 3 of the

Ordinance. Further, the Plaintiffs own evidence supports the prescriptive

claim of the 3rd defendant as far as the 2nd Defendant is concerned.

62

SC/APPEAL/30/2016

Q. Their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court have totally failed to

consider the well-reasoned finding of the learned District Judge that the

3rd Defendant/Appellant/Respondent had adduced no other oral or

documentary evidence apart from his own testimony in proof of his

prescriptive possession?

A. No, as explained above they failed in not considering the proviso to

section 3 of the Ordinance.

Q. Their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court have completely

failed to consider that all the documents produced by the 3rd Defendant

/Appellant/Respondent marked 3v1 to 3v 10 in proof of his prescriptive

possession of disputed Lot 1 were in fact relating to a completely different

land (Lot G), which fact was duly considered by the learned District Judge

in rejecting his plea of prescription?

A. Irrespective of the said documents, there were sufficient evidence in

favour of the 3rd Defendant. However, the learned High Court Judges

failed to consider the proviso to section 3 as explained above.

Hence, this Appeal is partly allowed and Judgment of the High Court and

the Judgment of the District Court shall be amended as explained above

in the Judgment.

No costs.
