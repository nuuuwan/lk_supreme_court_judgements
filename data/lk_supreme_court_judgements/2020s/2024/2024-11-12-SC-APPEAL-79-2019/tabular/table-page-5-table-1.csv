"The southern boundary of the land as stated in the deeds is a land known",""

"According  to  the  plaintiff’s  deeds,  the  eastern  boundary  is  Walewatta.",""
"However, the preliminary plan indicates that the eastern boundary of Lot",""
"1 is Lot 2, which the 4th defendant claims is part of Walewatta. If Lot 2 is",""

"Warakagahaowitawatta,  the  High  Court  ought  to  have  directed  the",""
"partition  of  Lot  1  rather  than  dismissing  the  action,  is  unsustainable",""
