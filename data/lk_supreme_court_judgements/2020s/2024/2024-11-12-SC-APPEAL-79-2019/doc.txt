Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Matara seeking to

partition the land known as Warakagahaowitawatta (),

approximately 1 acre in extent as morefully described in the plaint,

among the plaintiff ( share) and the 1st-3rd defendants ( share). At the

preliminary survey, the 4th defendant presented himself as a new

claimant. The preliminary plan comprises Lot 1 and Lot 2. The 4th

defendant sought to exclude Lot 2 on the basis that Lot 2 formed part of

a different land known as Walewatta (). He did not claim any

rights to Lot 1.

At the trial, the plaintiff raised no issues on the pedigree. The only contest

raised at the trial was the identification of the corpus. The contest was

between the plaintiff and the 4th defendant. The 1st-3rd defendants did not

participate in the trial, nor did they establish their title, if any. It appears

3

SC/APPEAL/79/2019

that they are not interested in the land at all but the plaintiff made them

parties in order to file a partition action. Such an approach undermines

the objective of a partition action. A partition action is brought to put an

end to the inconvenience of common ownership.

The plaintiffs pedigree is simple and straightforward. He produced only

three deeds, marked P1-P3, to assert his entitlement to a share of the

land.

The District Judge, by judgment dated 01.10.2010, rejected the claim of

the 4th defendant to exclude Lot 2 and proceeded to decide that both Lot

1 and Lot 2 form part of Warakagahaowitawatta. He allocated a share

to the plaintiff, while the remaining share was left unallotted. This

speaks volumes about the nature of this partition action.

Acting in revision, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Galle, in a well-

considered judgment, set aside the judgment of the District Court on the

ground that the land to be partitioned had not been properly identified.

This appeal by the plaintiff is against the judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal.

It is a well-established principle of law that if the identification of the

corpus is found to be unsatisfactory, the partition action must fail. The

identification of the corpus is a sine qua non for the investigation of title.

If the identification of the corpus is doubtful, the necessity for the

investigation of title does not arise.

Upon reading the judgment of the District Court, it is evident that the

District Judge concluded that Lot 2 is part of Warakagahaowitawatta, not

because there was sufficient evidence supporting that conclusion, but

because the 4th defendant failed to establish that Lot 2 is part of

Walewatta. This approach is incorrect. There was no burden on the 4th

defendant to prove anything.

SC/APPEAL/79/2019

Even the surveyor, in the report on the preliminary plan, does not state

that the land depicted in the preliminary plan is the land to be

partitioned. The surveyor has not answered that question at all. The

surveyor was not called to give evidence, despite the fact that the only

issue before the Court was the identification of the corpus.

In the judgment, the District Judge has found fault with the 4th defendant

for not taking out a separate commission to depict the correct corpus.

This is a wrong approach. The 4th defendant does not seek to partition

Warakagahaowitawatta. He has no interest in Warakagahaowitawatta.

When the contesting defendant or defendants do not seek partition of the

land, it becomes the duty of the plaintiff to correctly identify the land to

be partitioned, both in terms of its extent and boundaries. Failure to do

so will result in the dismissal of the action. However, this does not imply

that the existing extent and boundaries must perfectly align with those

in the old deeds. The extent and boundaries are likely to vary over time,

but any such discrepancies should ideally be explained in evidence,

rather than in submissions.

In comparing the boundaries between the land to be partitioned and the

land depicted in the preliminary plan, the District Judge, in his

judgment, states that the only boundary that does not tally is the western

boundary. This is incorrect.

Let me compare the four boundaries. According to the plaintiffs deeds,

the northern boundary of Warakagahaowitawatta is the land known as

Puswalkoratuwa. However, in the preliminary plan, Puswalkoratuwa

appears as the northern boundary of only Lot 1.

According to the plaintiffs deeds, the western boundary is the public

road, which is correct. Both the deeds and preliminary plan confirm the

public road as the western boundary.

SC/APPEAL/79/2019

The southern boundary of the land as stated in the deeds is a land known

as Warakawita, but according to the preliminary plan, Warakawita is the

southern boundary of Lot 1 only. The southern boundary of Lot 2 is

admittedly Walewatta, not Warakawita.

According to the plaintiffs deeds, the eastern boundary is Walewatta.

However, the preliminary plan indicates that the eastern boundary of Lot

1 is Lot 2, which the 4th defendant claims is part of Walewatta. If Lot 2 is

considered as part of Warakagahaowitawatta, then the eastern boundary

of Warakagahaowitawatta is the Pradeshiya Saba Road, not Walewatta.

The plaintiff did not give evidence on when the Pradeshiya Saba Road

came into existence.

In any event, even if Lots 1 and 2 are considered forming part of

Warakagahaowitawatta, there exists a significant discrepancy in the

extent, which has not been explained by the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed

the action to partition 1 acre land. The extent of both Lots 1 and 2 is 2

roods and 10 perches, which is nearly half the size of the land the plaintiff

sought to partition.

I agree with the finding of the High Court of Civil Appeal that the land to

be partitioned has not been properly identified. The argument of learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant that, if Lot 2 does not form part of

Warakagahaowitawatta, the High Court ought to have directed the

partition of Lot 1 rather than dismissing the action, is unsustainable

because of the unexplained discrepancy in the extent by the plaintiff in

his evidence. It is settled law that a partition action cannot be maintained

to partition only a portion of the land.

The question of law on which leave to appeal has been granted namely,

whether the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in concluding that the land

has not been properly identified, is answered in the negative.
