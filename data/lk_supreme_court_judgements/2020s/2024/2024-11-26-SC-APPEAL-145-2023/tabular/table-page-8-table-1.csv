"The said sub-section has no relevance to this Appeal, since our attention was not drawn to"
"any Order published in the Gazette in the instant Appeal."
"Section  16(3)  relates  to  an  undertaking  which  consists  of  the  production  of  any"
"agricultural, horticultural or dairy produce and utilizing such produce to manufacture any"
"product and costing of such product for tax purposes. This sub-section too, was not referred"
"to in this Appeal."
"Having referred to the sub-sections of Section 16, I wish to dissect Section 16(2)(b)"
"in greater detail, as it is this sub-section which is pivotal in this Appeal. The case of the"
"Respondent is that its business falls within this sub-section, as it is an undertaking in which"
"the ‘coconut husk is cleaned, sorted, dehydrated into coir fibre pith’. The Respondent"
"further contends, that coir fibre pith is not a change of character of the produce referred to"
"in  sub-section  (a),  but  only  a  change  in  the  form,  contour  and  physical  appearance,  in"
"preparation or processing of such produce i.e., coir fibre pith, for the market, compressed"
"into  bricks  and  blocks.  Coir  fibre  pith  is  extensively  used  as  a  substitute  for  peat  in"
"horticultural and agricultural purposes, because of its mulch like nature, high in porosity"
"and absorbency and water holding capacity and it is an ideal growing medium for plants."
"Thus, the  Respondent contends, that the process,  ‘clean, sort and dehydration’ is"
"covered under sub-section 16(2)(b) and the Respondent is lawfully entitled to the relevant"
"tax exemptions provided by the Statute."
"I see merit in this submission. However, prior to arriving at a conclusion, I wish to"
"consider the initial findings of the Department of Inland Revenue, the Determination of the"
"Tax Appeals Commission, the Judgement of the Court of Appeal, the submissions of the"
"learned President’s Counsel and the learned Deputy Solicitor General before  this Court,"
"and the written submissions filed in this Appeal."
"The initial finding of the Assessor, as referred to in the letter dated 30th May, 2012"
"was that manufacture of ‘coir fibre pith’, is a manufacturing of an article out of agricultural"
"produce  and  such  manufacturing  is  a  conversion  of  another  product  from  agricultural"
"produce and such profit is not a primary process."
"Upon appeal, the Appellant CGIR, by its Order dated 20th October, 2014 determined"
"that the agricultural produce is ‘coconut’ and therefore the primary process undertaken by"
"the Respondent should be aimed in preparation of those ‘coconuts’ into a marketable state,"
"but the Respondent had brought out a completely different product, that is ‘coir fibre pith’"
"extracted from the ‘coconut’, and therefore the exemption sought cannot be granted."
"From  the  foregoing  it  is  very  clear,  that  the  Appellant  CGIR,  has  restricted  and"
"narrowed down the agricultural produce of the coconut tree, i.e., cocos nucifera, to only"
"‘coconuts’, the fruit borne out of the tree, when in fact, there is no doubt that a tree or plant"
"can  produce  more  than  one  agricultural  produce  and  the  coconut  tree  produces  coconut"
"water, nuts, kernels, shells, husks, leaves and ekels, inflorescences and sap which can be"
"cleaned, sized, sorted, graded, chilled, dehydrated, packaged, cut and canned, a repertoire"
"of actions indeed, in preparation of such produce of the cocos nucifera plant for the market."
"Being aggrieved by the aforesaid Determination of the CGIR, the Respondent went"
"before the Tax Appeals Commission."
