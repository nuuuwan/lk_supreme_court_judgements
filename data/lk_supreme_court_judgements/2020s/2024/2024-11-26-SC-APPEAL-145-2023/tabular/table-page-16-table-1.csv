"If such primary produce is converted to a product as specified in Section 16(2)(c) or"
"if such primary produce is utilized to produce any product in terms of Section 16(3), then"
"an undertaking concerned with such process would also be exempted under the Act."
"If I go back to the illustration referred to earlier, strawberry jam or strawberry ice"
"cream goes through a manufacturing process and becomes a ‘product’. Similarly, coconut"
"milk powder and coconut oil also goes through a manufacturing process and becomes a"
"product, wherein the primary produce is the coconut kernel. Corollary, ‘coir fibre pith’ does"
"not go though a manufacturing process. Its only cleaned, sorted, dehydrated and packaged."
"Hence, for reasons adumbrated herein, I am of the view that ‘coir fibre pith’ falls"
"well within the parameters of Section 16(2)(b) of the Act."
"In the said circumstances, I hold that the Court of Appeal has not erred in its findings"
"pertaining to ‘coir fibre pith’. Thus, I answer the 3rd Question of Law in the negative and"
"in favour of the Respondent."
"In view of the aforesaid answer, which determines this Appeal to a finality, I do not"
"think it is necessary to consider the other two questions of law raised before this Court."
"Nevertheless, since leave has been granted on the said two questions, I wish to briefly look"
"at the said two questions raised before this Court now and I wish to consider the said two"
"questions together."
