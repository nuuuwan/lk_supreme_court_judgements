"","Prior to examining the said Section 16, I wish to refer to a few Sections of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, which are material. Section 2 refers to the imposition of income tax in respect",""
"of ‘profits and income’, and Section 3 refers to ‘income chargeable with tax’.",""
"","Sections 7 to 24, in Chapter III of the Act lays down the many exemptions that could"
"be resorted to by a tax payer to compute the income tax. One such exemption is enumerated",""
"in Section 16.",""
"","Having identified the lay-out and the Chapter pertaining to exemptions, let me now"
"move onto consider Section 16 and its sub-sections.",""
"","Section  16(1)  of  the  Act,  speaks  of  the  profits  and  income  of  any  person  or"
"partnership from any ‘agricultural undertaking’ carried on in Sri Lanka, to be exempted",""

"","In my view, the said sub-section encompasses a vast area of productions relating to"
"agricultural,  horticultural  and  dairy  produce.  The  Act  does  not  define","these  words."
"However, in order to understand the matter before us, I wish to look at the use of the said",""
"words  in  common  parlance.  ‘Agricultural’  refers  to  cultivating  land,  raising  crops  and",""
"livestock;  ‘Horticultural’  means,  garden  cultivation  of  plants,  fruits,  vegetables  and",""
"flowers; and ‘dairy produce’ refers to items made from milk of cows, buffaloes and goats",""

"‘Coconut cultivation and/or production’ falls within the scope of sub-section (a) of Section",""
"16(2).",""
"","Sub-section  (b)  of  Section  16  (2),  refers  to  an  undertaking  changing  the  form,"
"contour  or  physical  appearance  of  any  ‘produce’  referred  to  in  paragraph  (a),  in",""
"preparation  of  such  ‘produce’  for  the  market  by  cleaning,  sizing,  sorting,  grading,",""
"chilling, dehydrating, packaging, cutting and canning of such ‘produce’.",""
"","In the instant Appeal, the Respondent sought exemption under this particular sub-"
"section, for its ‘coir fibre pith’.",""
"","Sub-section (c) of Section 16(2) refers to an undertaking for the conversion of any"
"produce in sub-section(a) into products as specified in an Order published in the Gazette.",""
