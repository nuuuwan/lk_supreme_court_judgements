"Ordinance to justify his contention. He also drew a parallel between our case law, English"
"law and the following authorities."
"R. Turner (1816) 5 M & S 206; Dickinson v. Minister of Pensions (1953) 1QB"
"228;   Sumati Dayal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore [1995] SCC Supp (2)"
"453; and Commissioner of Customs (Import) Mumbai v. Dilip Kumar and Company"
"and others (2018) 9 SCC 1  30.07.2018 Civil Appeal No. 3327 of 2007."
"In response, the Respondent did not challenge the said position. The contention of"
"the Respondent was that the ‘onus’ was never an issue and therefore it is immaterial to the"
"substantial question before court."
"Undoubtedly, our courts and the courts of other jurisdictions, have consistently held,"
"that if the burden of proving a fact is within the knowledge of any person, then the proof of"
"that fact is upon him. Similarly, in relation to fiscal matters, if an item is not taxable because"
"it falls within the exemptions provided by the Act, then proving of such fact too, lies with"
"the person (assesse) who has personal knowledge of such fact."
"Thus, I see no reason to deviate from the said reasoning. If a matter is within the"
"specific knowledge of a person, the burden lies upon such person to prove such fact."
"However, in respect of the 1st question of law and the burden of proof, the grievances"
"of the Appellant appears to be the reference of the learned judge, in the impugned Court of"
"Appeal judgement to Sections 214 and 215 of the Act, viz., powers of inspection."
"The  Appellant  contends,  the  words  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  judgement,  that  the"
"‘Assessor could have ascertained the true nature of the process by calling for further proof"
"or carrying out an inspection’, turns the tax law ‘on its head’, if I be permitted to refer to"
"the learned DSG’s words itself."
"In my view, such statement appears to be made in obiter. A obiter dictum statement"
"has no binding effect. In the matter before us, the onus or the burden of proof, was not the"
"issue, and is immaterial in deciding this matter. The point of contention was in relation to"
"‘coir fibre pith’ and whether ‘coir fibre pith’ falls within the provisions of Section 16(2)(b)"
"of  the  Act  or  not.  The  Court  of  Appeal,  has  correctly  identified  the  said  issue,  and  has"
"examined it in the light of decided cases and had come to its findings. Hence, the reference"
"to  powers  of  inspection  and  calling  for  further  proof,  will  not  have  any  bearing  or"
"difference, as it is per se obiter."
"Thus, the 1st question of law raised is hypothetical in nature and has no bearing to"
"the matter in issue. Given the circumstances of this Appeal, I am of the view, that the Court"
"of Appeal did not err in arriving at its findings."
