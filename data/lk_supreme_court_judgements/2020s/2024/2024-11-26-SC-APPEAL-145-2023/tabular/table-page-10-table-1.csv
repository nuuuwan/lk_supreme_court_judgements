"Being  aggrieved  by  the  findings  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission,  the  CGIR"
"appealed to the Court of Appeal by way of a Case Stated."
"Having considered the Case Stated, the facts and the law, the Court of Appeal also"
"determined that agricultural, horticultural or dairy produce referred to in Section 16(2)(a)"
"is  the  primary  produce  and  when  such  primary  produce  is  subjected  to  the  processing"
"specified in Section 16(2)(b), then such produce would fall within the exemption granted"
"under Section 16(2)(b) of the Act."
"Further, the Court of Appeal held, if such produce referred to in Section 16(2)(a) is"
"converted  to  any  product  specified  in  an  Order  published  in  the  Gazette  referred  to  in"
"Section 16(2)(c), that product too, will fall within the exemption granted under the Act."
"Likewise, if any agricultural, horticultural or dairy produce is utilized to manufacture any"
"product other than a product specified in Section 16(2)(c), the same falls within Section"
"16(3), and the exemption provided for in Section 16(1) is applicable to such product too."
"Based on the above analysis, the finding of the Court of Appeal was that the process"
"adopted  by  the  Respondent  in  ‘cleaning,  sorting  and  dehydration’  for  the  purpose  of"
"changing the form or physical appearance of ‘coir fibre pith’, falls within the definition of"
"an agricultural undertaking under Section 16(2)(b) of the Act."
"In  my  view,  the  learned  judges  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  have  correctly  analysed"
"Section 16(2) and applied the provisions therein."
"I wish to note, that in the Petition filed before the Court of Appeal, the CGIR uses"
"the word ‘coconut fibre pith’, interchangeably with ‘coir fibre pith’. However, for ease of"
"reading, I will continue to use the term ‘coir fibre pith’ in this Judgement."
"Now, I wish to look at Section 16 of the Act from another perspective. The Section"
"clearly and unambiguously states, that the primary produce specified in sub-section (a) of"
"Section 16(2) can undergo three processes. The said three processes are as follows:"
