"Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC. J.,"
"This  is  a  Tax  Appeal  filed  by  the  Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue"
"challenging the Judgement of the Court of Appeal dated 10th August, 2022."
"The Court of Appeal by the aforesaid Judgement, in a ‘Case Stated’ affirmed the"
"Determination of the Tax Appeals Commission (“the Commission”), dated 27th April, 2017"
"whereby it was determined by the Commission that the Respondent-Respondent, Lignocell"
"(Pvt) Ltd., was entitled to the tax exemptions claimed and dismissed the appeal filed by the"
"Commissioner  General  of  Inland  Revenue.  The  said  Respondent  Lignocell  (Pvt)  Ltd,  is"
"now  substituted  by  Chas.  P.  Hayley  and  Company  (Private)  Limited  (“the  Substituted"
"Respondent”)."
"Initially, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (“CGIR/the Appellant”), in"
"terms of Section 16 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended, rejected the"
"claim for tax exemptions  made by the Respondent, Lignocell (Pvt) Ltd., for the taxable"
"periods 2009/2010 and 2010/2011."
"B
eing  aggrieved  by  the  said  decision  of  the  CGIR  (which  upheld  the  Assessor’s"
"findings,  in  appeal)  the  Respondent  Lignocell  (Pvt)  Ltd.,  went  before  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission. The Commission allowed the Respondent’s appeal."
"The Appellant CGIR thereafter, invoked the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. The"
"Court  of  Appeal  too  determined,  that  the  Respondent  is  entitled  to  the  tax  exemptions"
"claimed in terms of Section 16 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006. Being aggrieved"
"by the Judgement of the Court of Appeal, the Appellant CGIR has come before this Court,"
"after obtaining Special Leave to Appeal, on three Questions of Law."
