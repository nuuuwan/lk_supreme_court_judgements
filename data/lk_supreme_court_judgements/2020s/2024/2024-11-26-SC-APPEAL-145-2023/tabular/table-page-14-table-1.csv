"This in my view, is to avoid conflict between the two provisions of an enactment,"
"to arrive at a proper construction of the enactment."
"The Court of Appeal too, in the case of Distilleries Company Ltd v. Kariyawasam"
"and others [2001] 3 SLR 119 observed that the provisions of law, has to be interpreted"
"contextually, giving consideration to the spirit of the law."
"Similarly,  as  held  in  Vellupillai  v.  The  Chairman,  Urban  District  Council"
"39  NLR  464,  the  object  of  a  court  of  law  is  to  approach  the  task  of  interpretation  of  a"
"provision of law without extensive formalism and technicality, since it is not an academy"
"of law."
"Thus, in my view the provisions in Section 16(2)(a) and (b) should be construed, so"
"that there may be no repugnancy or inconsistency between the said two sub-sections."
"As discussed earlier, Section 16(2)(a) refers to ‘an undertaking for the purpose of"
"the production of any agricultural, horticultural or any dairy produce’ and Section 16(2)(b)"
"refers to ‘such produce being prepared for the market, by cleaning, sizing, sorting, grading,"
"chilling,  dehydrating,  packaging,  cutting  or  canning  by  changing  the  form,  contour  or"
"physical appearance’."
"Hence, any agricultural produce, I emphasise the word ‘any’, in preparation for the"
"market in the  manner described by sub-section 16(2)(b), irrespective  of  a change in  the"
"form,  contours  and  physical  appearance,  provided  the  character  is  not  changed,  will  be"
"entitled to the exemption granted by the Statute."
"‘Coir fibre pith’, as narrated by the Respondent is ‘cleaned, sorted and dehydrated’"
"into marketable state by compressing into bricks and blocks. Thus, even if the form, contour"
"and physical appearance of ‘coir fibre pith’ may have changed, since its character has not"
"changed, in my view it should fall within the provisions of Section 16(2)(b) of the Act and"
"the undertaking which carries on such functions should be entitled to the exemption granted"
"by the Statute. This exemption in any event is only granted for a limited period of five years"
"and as observed by the Tax Appeals Commission is to encourage persons to be innovative"
"and optimize the use of agricultural produce."
"Another point strenuously put forward by the learned DSG as of vital importance in"
"deciding  the  3rd  Question  of  Law  was  the  distinction  between  the  ‘produce’  and  the"
"‘product’. The learned DSG’s submission with reference to Blacks Law Dictionary, was"
"that a ‘produce’ comes into existence as a result of natural growth, whereas ‘product’ is the"
"outcome  of  any  manufacturing  process,  whereby  the  ‘produce’  has  been  converted  to  a"
"distinct ‘end product’. To substantiate, this proposition,  vis-â-vis, the coir fibre pith, the"
"learned DSG falls back on the financial statements of the Respondent, with regard to raw"
"materials and consumables and surmise coir fibre pith to be a product and not a produce."
"He also highlights the significance of the word ‘manufacture’ to submit, that a ‘product’"
"can be manufactured, but not a ‘produce’."
"Countering  the  said  submissions  of  the  learned  DSG,  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel for the Respondent takes up the position, that the production process adopted by"
"the  Respondent  was  never  a  point  of  contention  before  the  CGIR  and  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission. The learned President’s Counsel further submitted that the consistent position"
