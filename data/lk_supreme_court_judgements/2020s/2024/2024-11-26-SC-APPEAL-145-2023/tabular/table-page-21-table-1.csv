"words of the Statute. In the appeal before this Court for determination, the words of the"
"Statute is clear and precise. There is no ambiguity or doubt whatsoever."
"In the said circumstances, I see no merit in the submissions of the Appellant, where"
"there is ambiguity or doubt, that it should always be resolved in favour of the revenue and"
"against the assesse. Such a contention would go against the cannons of interpretation."
"Further, I am of the view, that a hard and fast rule cannot be laid down in a situation"
"where there is ambiguity or doubt. Every incident should be looked at and resolved, having"
"regard  to  the  words  of  the  Statute  and  the  intention  of  the  Legislature.  Thus,  a  general"
"presumption or a hypothetical assertion, as contented by the Appellant cannot be laid down."
"The Court of Appeal has followed the said reasoning. Thus, I am of the view that"
"the Court of Appeal did not err in arriving at its finding."
"In the aforesaid circumstances, answering the  2nd Question of Law too, will not"
"arise."
"Conclusion"
"For reasons morefully adumbrated in this judgement, and especially in view of the"
"answers  given  to  the  Questions  of  Law,  I  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  impugned"
"judgement."
"I  uphold  the  judgement  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  dated  10th  August,  2022  and  the"
"Determination of the Tax Appeals Commission dated 27th April, 2017."
