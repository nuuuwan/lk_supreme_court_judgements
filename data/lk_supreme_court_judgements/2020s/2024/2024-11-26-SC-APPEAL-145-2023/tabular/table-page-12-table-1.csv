"issue is, whether such ‘coir fibre pith’, not the ‘coir fibre’, can be considered a primary"
"produce or not."
"The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue by its order dated 20th October, 2014"
"determined that only the ‘coconut’ is the primary produce in relation to coconut cultivation."
"He categorically stated  “In this case the agricultural produce based is coconut […]  the"
"primary process undertaken by the company should be aimed towards in preparation those"
"coconuts into a marketable state to become an agricultural undertaking”."
"According to the CGIR, the agricultural undertaking to which the exemption stated"
"in Section 16(2)(b) applies i.e., the repertoire of actions referred to therein, clean, size, sort,"
"grade,  chill,  dehydrate,  package,  cut  and  canned  in  so  far  as  coconut  production  or"
"cultivation is concerned, is only for the coconut!"
"Is it only the whole ‘coconut’, with the husk intact or is it the husked coconut itself?"
"Could  it  be  the  kernel,  or  the  water  inside  the  coconut?  If  so,  can  you  separate  or"
"differentiate a ‘husk’ from a ‘husked coconut’ or the ‘pith’ or the ‘dust’ or the ‘peat’ of a"
"husk from the coconut husk?’"
"What  about  the  sap  of  the  coconut  inflorescence  or  flower,  or  the  ekels  of  the"
"coconut leaves? Are they not produce of a coconut palm?"
"Should  only  the  ‘nut’,  if  I  may  use  the  said  word,  of  the  coconut  palm,  and  its"
"components i.e., the kernel, the water and the shell be classified as the primary produce?"
"Cannot the other components of a coconut and the coconut palm, be it may the coconut"
"husk, the fibre, the pith or the sap and the coconut inflorescence, or the coconut leaves and"
"the ekels, fall within the provisions of Section 16(2)(a) of the Act, and be a primary produce"
"in order for it to be cleaned, sized, sorted, graded, chilled, dehydrated, packaged, cut and"
"canned  as  an  agricultural  produce  to  be  prepared  for  the  market  and  be  entitled  to  the"
"exemption provided for in Section 16(1) of the Act?"
"What was the intention of the Legislature? Was the produce be limited to the ‘nut’"
"or could other produce, be also encompassed in the word ‘produce’ and go thorough the"
"activities referred to in Section 16(2)(b), for the said produce to be prepared for the market?"
"In  order  to  achieve  the  intention  of  the  Legislature  in  my  view,  a  harmonious"
"interpretation should be given to Section 16(2)(a) and 16(2)(b) of the Act."
"The cardinal rule in interpreting a Statute is that the Rules of Interpretation should"
"be followed, foremost, to preserve the intention of the Legislature. If the words are plain"
"and unambiguous, and only indicate one meaning, then the literal meaning should be given."
"If not, a harmonious meaning should be given, for the section to be construed, so that there"
"may  be  no  repugnancy  or  inconsistency.  The  duty  of  the  court  is  to  implement  the"
"provisions, without departing from the policy underlined in the law."
"Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes [12th ed 2021] at page 355 states as follows:"
