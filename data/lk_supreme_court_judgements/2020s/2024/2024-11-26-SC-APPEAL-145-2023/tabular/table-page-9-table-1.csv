"The  Tax  Appeals  Commission  overruled  the  CGIR’s  ruling  and  determined  that"
"‘coir  fibre  pith’  is  also  an  agricultural  produce  collected  from  the  coconut  tree,  like  the"
"shells, husks and ekels and that its character has not changed, except it is compressed into"
"blocks."
"In coming to such finding, the Tax Appeals Commission referred to the illustration"
"[referred to by the Appellant] of Strawberries, collected from cultivators and then cleaned"
"and packed into boxes vis-â-vis Strawberry jam made out of the very same Strawberries."
"The analysis of the Commission was in the first instance, the character does not change but"
"the in the second instance i.e., when jam is made, the character of the Strawberry changes."
"Moreover, the Commission held,  when Strawberries are cleaned and packed into boxes,"
"Section  16(2)(b)  comes  into  effect  and  the  undertaking  can  claim  the  exemption  from"
"Income Tax, but when jam is made such undertaking will not fall within Section 16(2)(b),"
"as  the  character  of  the  Strawberries  has  changed  and  thus,  is  not  entitled  to  claim  the"
"exemption."
"The Tax Appeals Commission also referred to two Indian cases, Commissioner of"
"Income  Tax  v.  Stanes  Amalgamated  Estates  Ltd  (1998)  232  ITR  443  (Mad)  and  Seth"
"Banarsi Das Gupta v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi (Central) (1977) 106 ITR"
"804 (All)."
"In Stanes Amalgamated case, Eucalyptus oil was extracted from the leaves of the"
"plant  and  in  Seth  Banarsi  Case,  gur  or  jaggery  was  made  out  of  Sugar  Cane.  The"
"Commission  referred  to  the  said  cases  as  instances,  in  which  the  character  has  changed"
"from the initial agricultural produce to some other product, to distinguish that in ‘coir fibre"
"pith’ such a change has not taken place."
"The Tax Appeals  Commission also held  that  ‘coir fibre pith’ is a produce of the"
"coconut plant and is found in the coconut husk in its original form. Since the character and"
"the identity of ‘coir fibre pith’ does not change when it is compressed into bricks and blocks"
"in preparation of such produce for the market, and only the form, contours and the physical"
"appearance  changes,  the  Commission  took  the  view,  that  the  Respondent  can  claim  the"
"exemption under Section 16(2)(b) of the Act."
"Furthermore, the Tax Appeals Commission held, that the CGIR’s rationale that only"
"‘coconut’ or the ‘nut’ or fruit, could be the produce from a coconut tree was manifestly"
"irrational, unacceptable and erroneous. Hence, the Commission determined that not only"
"the ‘coconut’, but all other marketable items produced by the coconut plant, including the"
"husks, ekels and the coir fibre pith, should be considered as ‘coconut produce’."
"The Commission also considered the exemptions given by the Statute for five years"
"as the policy of the Government to encourage persons to be innovative and optimize the"
"use of agricultural produce to enhance the economy and thus, a restrictive application of"
"Section  16(2)(b)  would  curtail  the  desired  result  of  the  concession  contemplated  by  the"
"policy makers."
"In my view, the Tax Appeals Commission has correctly considered the provisions"
"of  the  Act  and  the  issue  pertaining  to  exemptions,  and  has  come  to  a  legal  and  logical"
"finding in granting the exemption claimed by the Respondent."
