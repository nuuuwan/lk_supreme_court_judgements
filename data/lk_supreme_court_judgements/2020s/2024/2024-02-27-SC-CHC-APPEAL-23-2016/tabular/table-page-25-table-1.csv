"SC (CHC)Appeal No.23/2016"
"Court.    The  legally  prescribed  process  of  serving  summons  was  therefore"
"complied with by the Deputy Fiscal of the District Court of  Batticaloa and by"
"the “ is;dis fnokakd” who acted on his precept."
"The  Appellants  objection  to  the  legality  of  service  of  summons  by  a"
"“is;dis fnokakd” and not by the Fiscal or a Grama Niladhari is based on the specific"
"reference  made  to  the  two  officers  in  that  Section.  Clearly  the  Appellants"
"contend  that  summons  could  be  served  properly  either  by  Fiscal  or  Grama"
"Niladhari  and  no  other.  In  view  of  the  statutory  provisions  referred  to  in  the"
"preceding  paragraphs, 
it 
is  my  view  that  the  mere  absence  of  a  specific"
"reference to a process server (is;dis yd weialSis ls
%hd;aul lrkakd) in Section 60, does"
"not  make  it  illegal  for  a  Court  to  satisfy  itself  of  the  fact  that  summons  was"
"served, (a necessary pre requisite in Section 84 to proceed  ex parte,) upon the"
"“affidavit  of  such  service”  as 
it 
is  a  course  of  action  made  permissible  by"
"provisions of Section 61."
"In the absence of any specific words confining the said affidavit only to"
"a  Fiscal  or  a  Grama  Niladhari  in  Section  84  and  since  Section  61,  makes  an"
"affidavit  of  a  “  is;dis  fnokakd/  is;dis  yd  weialSis  ls
%hd;aul  lrkakd”  shall  be  sufficient"
"evidence of  the service of summons,  and the contents of the  said affidavit of"
"%hd;aul  lrkakd” 
the“  is;dis  fnokakd/  is;dis  yd  weialSis  ls
  of  the  District  Court  of"
"Batticaloa  is  deemed  to  be  correct  unless  and  until  the  contrary  is  proved  by"
"the Appellants, it is my considered view that the Commercial High Court had"
"rightly  relied  on  the  affidavit  V1  as  well  as  the  oral  evidence  of  the  process"
"server to hold that there was due service of summonses on them."
"In  view  of  the  forgoing,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  second  and  third"
"grounds  of 
appeal  of 
the  Appellants 
are 
also  devoid  of 
any  merit."
"Accordingly, 
the  order  of 
the  Commercial  High  Court  dated  13.05.2016,"
"25"
