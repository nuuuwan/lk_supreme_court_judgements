"were  served  with  summons  by  way  of  registered  post  as  well  as  personally."
"There  is  no  material  to  indicate  that  the  registered  articles  were  returned"
"undelivered. None of the Appellants specifically deny not receiving them by"
"post  either.  However,  the  Respondent  Company  did  not  tender  delivery"
"advices or the endorsements of service as evidence before Court, in relation to"
"the  fact  that  summonses  were  also  served  through  post. 
  However,

the 
formal  process  of

"summons.  Since,  the  affidavit  V1,  in  terms  of  Section  81,  “shall  be  sufficient"
"evidence  of  the  service  of  the  summons  and  of  the  date  of  such  service  and  shall  be"
"admissible in evidence” the statements contained therein shall be deemed to be"
