"correct unless and until the contrary is proved.”"
"The  first  part  of  the  Section  refers  to  a  situation  where  the  summons"
"served by registered post. It then proceeds to deal with the situation “where the"
"summons is served in any other manner.”  In the instant appeal, the Summonses"
"were  served  by  a  process  server  and  therefore  such  service  could  clearly  be"
"taken  as  an  instance  where  the  summons  served  “in  any  other  manner”.  The"
"remaining  part  of  the  said Section  provides  for  how  the  service  of  summons"
"could  be  established.  The  applicable  part  of  the  Section  in  this  regard  reads"
"“… affidavit of such service shall be sufficient evidence of the service of the summons"
"and  of  the  date  of  such  service,  and  shall  be  admissible  in  evidence  and  shall  be"
"sufficient evidence of the service of the summons.”"
