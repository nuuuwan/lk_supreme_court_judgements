UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The Petitioner has complained that his fundamental rights to equality

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka has been infringed by

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

3

At the time of the alleged incident, the 1st Petitioner was a 14-year-old

student in Grade 10, Nindana Maha Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda, and the 2nd

Petitioner was the father of the 1st Petitioner. On 7th March 2008, around 3.30 p. m.

when the 1st Petitioner was at home with his mother the 1st to 4th Respondents with

two other Police Officers had come to their compound with a sniffer dog and

inquired as to the whereabouts of the 2nd Petitioner. Since the 2nd Petitioner was in

his paddy field the 1st Petitioner, having obliged to assist the Police to find the way

to the paddy field which was about seven kilometres away from his house had got

in to the Respondents’ vehicle. Thereafter the 1st Petitioner was taken to

Meetiyagoda Police Station.

At the Police Station the 2nd Respondent had grabbed the 1st Petitioner

by his hair and assaulted him asking in sinhala ‘badu deepan’. Thereafter the 2nd

Respondent who was wearing shoes, had pulled the 1st Petitioner on to the ground

and trampled the 1st Petitioner whilst kicking him. At that time, the 2nd Respondent

had received a telephone call and had ordered the 1st Respondent to move the 1st

Petitioner out of the room. Upon the said directions, the 1st Respondent had taken

the 1st Petitioner to the Crime Division and had assaulted him again.

At this point, the 3rd Respondent, who brought a club had assaulted

the 1st Petitioner on his buttocks whilst the 1st Respondent was holding the 1st

Petitioner by the shoulders. Thereafter the 1st and 3rd Respondents had taken the 1st

Petitioner to a room and tied his hands behind his back with a rope while the other

end of the rope was thrown over a beam which was pulled by the 3rd Respondent.

The 1st Respondent had raised the 1st Petitioner by his legs and the 3rd Respondent

had tied the other end of the rope to a nearby concrete pillar. Thereafter the 1st

Petitioner had been beaten by the 3rd Respondent whilst questioning him about the

jewellery and money taken by him breaking a house.

4

At about 8.00 p. m. the 2nd Respondent arrived at the Police Station

and directed the 1st Respondent to keep the 1st Petitioner in the cell. At this

moment, the Petitioners had noticed that a Police Officer was taking down

statements of the 4th Respondent’s sister-in-law, her husband and her son.

On the following day, the 1st Petitioner had been produced before the

Magistrate, Balapitiya, and was bailed out. On the following day, the 1st Petitioner

had been admitted to the Balapitiya Base Hospital and discharged from the

Hospital on the 13th March, 2008. Thereafter, on the next day the 1st Petitioner had

been re-admitted to the same Hospital and warded till the 24th of March 2008. On

14th of March 2008, the 1st Petitioner had been examined by the Judicial Medical

Officer.

On the 11th March 2008, the 2nd Petitioner has made a complaint to the

ASP Elpitiya, and on 27th March 2008 the ASP has recorded the statements. Also,

by letter dated 19th of March 2008, the 2nd Petitioner has complained to the Human

Rights Commission about the assault to the 1st Petitioner by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents.

The Petitioners have averred that the traumatic and brutal acts of the

1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have caused a great physical pain and grave

psychological distress and trauma to the 1st Petitioner. As a result of the torturous

acts the 1st Petitioner was unable to attend to his day to day work for more than

three weeks. The Petitioners have complained to this court that the 1st Petitioner

was subjected to torture and to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments by the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Respondents and the Petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been infringed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents.

5

The 1st to and 3rd Respondents were absent and unrepresented at the

hearing of this case. Journal Entries of the original docket indicates that the Said

Respondents have been represented by a counsel until 21.09.2015. They have been

duly noticed by this court to attend and defend their case.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have filed their statement of

objections dated 21st July 2008. In the said statement of objections the 1st to 3rd

Respondents have not specifically denied the several allegations levelled against

them in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the petition dated 07.04.2008. They have

merely stated that they are unaware of the said allegations contained in the said

paragraphs. Also, the 1st to 3rd Respondents have neither denied nor answered the

allegations levelled against them in paragraphs 13 to 18 of the said petition.

It is very important to note that in paragraph 14 of the petition it is

averred that the conduct of the 1st to 3rd Respondents and their failure to afford

equal protection of the law, have resulted in the Petitioner’s rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution being violated. Also, in paragraph 16 of the

petition it is stated that due to the aforesaid violations the Petitioners have suffered

substantial and grave physical, psychological and financial harm, damage and loss

and therefore the Petitioners entitled to substantial compensation in a sum

determined by court. Since the 1st to 3rd Respondents have not denied and/or

answered to the said allegations levelled against them by the Petitioners the said

allegations will have to be considered on the facts and circumstances pleaded by

the Petitioners.

The 1st Petitioner had been examined by the JMO and the Medico

Legal Report dated 05.02.2009 has been filed of record. According to the Medico-

Legal Report the 1st Petitioner had been examined by the JMO on 13.03. 2008 and

6

14.03.2008. The JMO has found 08 non-grievous injuries on the body of the 1st

Petitioner.

The 1st to 3rd Respondents answering the averments contained in

paragraph 5(viii) of the Petition, in paragraph 7 of their statement of objections has

stated that one M. Tennyson who was in the police cell on 07.03.2008, had seen

the 2nd Petitioner reprimanding the 1st Petitioner and also beating him. Said M.

Tennyson in his affidavit has stated that when he was in the police cell he noticed

bringing a child to the Police Station. On 07.03.2008, at about 07.00 p.m. when the

said child was seated in a plastic chair in front of the police cell, father of the said

child came to the police station and proceeded to the child after obtaining

permission of the Reserve Police Officer and reprimanded the child whilst beating

him on his back and shoulders.

It is surprising to note that the said Reserve Police Officer has not

made minutes with regard to the said assault took place in the Police Station. With

regard to such an assault the best evidence would have been the said Reserve

Police Officer. But the 1st to 3rd Respondents have failed to adduce such evidence

in defending their case.

In cases where the fundamental rights have been infringed, a burden

lie on the Petitioner to adduce evidence to the satisfaction of court since the court

will look for a high degree of probability in deciding which of the facts alleged

have been established. That does not mean that an undue burden is placed on a

Petitioner in his mission for access to justice, by court. When Respondents remain

silent on the matters that have to be explained by them, then such conduct of the

Respondents will ease the burden cast on the Petitioner. At such situations, the

court will act on the materials placed before court by the Petitioner.

7

Needless to reiterate the duty cast upon the police towards a person

taken in to custody that the Police are not entitled to lay a finger on a person

arrested, even if he is a hardened criminal, unless the suspect resist the arrest or

attempts to escape.

In view of the custodial relationship between the 1st to 3rd

Respondents and the 1st Petitioner their conduct was high handed and in deliberate

disregard of the 1st Petitioner’s rights. The 1st Petitioner has been severely

assaulted when he was in police custody and his right to the equal protection of law

has been denied by the 1st to 3rd Respondents. Therefore, I hold that the 1st

Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution

have been violated by the 1st to 3rd Respondents. Hence the 1st Petitioner is entitled

to compensation for the injuries sustained, hospitalisation and pain suffering and

humiliation suffered by him.

Accordingly, I make order that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents shall

pay a sum of Rs. 300,000/= (Rs. 100,000/- per each) as compensation and a sum of

Rs 75,000/= (25,000 per each) as costs to the 1st Petitioner.
