Sanjeewa Dissanayake SSC for the Respondents. Argued & Decided on: 21.09.2017 Sisira J.de Abrew, J Heard both counsel in support of their respective cases. The appellants in this case

signed a bail bond for Rs. 02 millions ( each appellant signed a bond for Rs. One million ) to

produce the accused on each and every day that the case is called. The accused did not appear

3

in Court and the learned Magistrate issued warrants on the accused and the sureties and after

inquiry the learned Magistrate made an order dated 28.11.2013 to forfeit the money stated in

the bail bond. Since they failed to pay the said amount, the Magistrate made an order to recover

the said amount, as a fine. In default of the fine he sentenced the sureties to 06 months Simple

Imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate dated 28.11.2013, the

appellants appealed to the High Court and the learned High Court Judge by order dated

15.05.2015 dismissed the appeal.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the High Court Judge, the appellants have

appealed to this Court. When a surety is produced before a Magistrate for failure to produce

the suspect or the Accused he must act under section 422(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code

which reads as follows:- “ If sufficient cause is not shown, and the penalty is not paid, the

Court may proceed to recover the same by issuing a warrant for the attachment and sale of

the moveable or immovable property belonging to such person” . The most important question

that must be decided in this case is whether the learned Magistrate has acted under section

422(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Both parties admit that the learned Magistrate

has failed to act under section 422(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).

The Magistrate is empowered to act under section 422(4) of the CPC, only after

he complied with section 422(2)of the CPC. Section 422(4) reads as follows:- “ If such penalty

be not paid and cannot be recovered by such attachment and sale, the person so bound

shall be liable by order of the Court which issued the warrant to simple imprisonment for a

4

term which may extend to 06 months ”. As I observed earlier the learned Magistrate has failed

to comply with section 422(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. He has failed to give reason for

not complying with section 422(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. In my view if a Court

intends to make an order under section 422(4) of the CPC, the said Court should first act

under section 422(1),(2) of the CPC. A Court cannot act under section 422(4) of the CPC

without acting under section 422(1),(2) of the CPC. This view is supported by the Judicial

decision in De Silva Vs S.I. Police- Kandy 63 C.L.W. Page 109 wherein Supreme Court

held as follows:- “ The order of forfeiture should be set aside as the learned Magistrate had

failed to comply with the provisions of section 411(1) and (4) of the Criminal Procedure

Code. He should have recorded the grounds of proof that the bond had been forfeited and it

is only if the penalty cannot be recovered by attachment and sale that he could have imposed

the sentence on him for imprisonment.” Section 411(4) of the old Criminal Procedure

has been reproduced as section 422(4) of the CPC. As I observed earlier, the learned

Magistrate had failed to comply with section 422(1),(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Therefore he could not have acted under section 422(4) of the CPC. It appears that the learned

Magistrate was too quick in sentencing the appellants.

We therefore hold that the order of forfeiting money stated in the bail bond, imposing

the fine and sentencing the appellants ( sureties) to six months simple imprisonment is clearly

wrong. We therefore set side the order of the learned Magistrate dated 28.11.2013. If the learned

Magistrate's order is wrong, the order of the High Court Judge refusing to set aside the said

order of the Magistrate is also wrong. The learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the said provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. We therefore set aside the order

of the learned High Court Judge dated 15.05.2015.

5

The learned Magistrate is hereby directed to act under section 422 of the Criminal

Procedure Code in order to recover the amount stated in the bail bonds from each surety.

Appeal is allowed. Both orders of the Magistrate and the High Court Judge are set aside. The

Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this order to the Magistrate's Court and the

High Court forthwith.
