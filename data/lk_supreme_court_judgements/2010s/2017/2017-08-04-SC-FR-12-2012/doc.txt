ALUWIHARE, PC, J: In this application the Petitioner complains that the holding of a disciplinary

inquiry against him and the subsequent decision to demote the Petitioner from

the rank of Sergeant to the rank of Police constable by the Inspector General of

Police (the 11th Respondent) is irrational and arbitrary and had resulted in the

infringement of his fundamental rights.

The court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violations under Articles 12

(1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution, against the 1st, 11th and 12th Respondents.

The grievances complained of appear to be twofold:- (1) The disciplinary inquiry was conducted contrary to Police Departmental orders. And (ii) The demotion of the Petitioner was without sufficient cause and is excessive and contrary to principles of fairness and proportionality. It is further alleged that the demotion meted out to the Petitioner was due to one

Ranjith Abeysinghe prevailing upon the police and influencing the decision

making process, with regard to the punishment meted out to the Petitioner.

Facts:

On the 7th of November, 2009, the Petitioner who was attached to the Traffic

Branch of the Hatton Police has been on duty accompanied by Constable

Wickramasinghe. Petitioner had stopped a vehicle due to the erratic manner in

which it was being driven. When he approached the vehicle, he had observed

that both the driver and the passengers in the vehicle were under a state of

4

intoxication. The driver had identified himself as Ranjith Abeysinghe and the

Petitioner says the driver did not possess a valid driving license.

Having brought the vehicle concerned and the driver and the other occupants to

the Police Station, when the Petitioner took steps to subject the driver Ranjith

Abeysinghe to a Breathalyzer test, he had not cooperated. As a result, the

Petitioner states that he had had to produce him before the medical officer

Dickoya Base Hospital, who had given a report to the effect that Abeysinghe’s

breath was smelling of alcohol.

Having returned to the Police Station, the petitioner had got another officer to

record a statement from Abeysinghe and he had been released on (police) bail

with instructions to appear before the Hon. Magistrate of Hatton on 10th

November, 2009. On the said date Ranjith Abeysinghe had pleaded guilty to both

counts; driving after consuming liquor and driving without a valid driving

license and a fine of Rs. 7,500/-. had been imposed on him.

The Petitioner goes on to say that on the day of the detection referred to above,

Ranjith Abeysinghe was released from Police Station within about three and half

hours, after attending to the formalities in connection with the detection. The

Petitioner had added that while Abeysinghe was at the Police Station several

acquaintances of his had come to the police station and the two passengers had

wanted the petitioner, via their mobile phones, to speak to prominent

politicians, and senior police officers, but the Petitioner state that he did not

accede to their requests. Further the Petitioner had wanted them to use their

phones outside the area where he was attending to the duties.

About a month after the incident, somewhere in December, 2009 both the

Petitioner and Constable Wickremasinghe had had to make statements to the

5

Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) over a complaint made by Abeysinghe

against the Petitioner.

Subsequent to the recording of the statements, a charge sheet containing 10

charges had been served on the Petitioner which was followed by an inquiry

presided over by the 12th Respondent who acted as the sole inquiring officer.

Petitioner asserts that the inquiring officer (12th Respondent) was accompanied

by the complainant Ranjith Abeysinghe every time he came to the inquiry as

well as, when he left it.

The inquiry, the Petitioner states, had been concluded in seven days and he

had been found guilty of 9 charges leveled against him and the 11th

Respondent had demoted him from the rank of Sergeant to Constable as a

punishment.

As referred to earlier, the Petitioner had alleged that, on one hand the

disciplinary inquiry was held in a manner to please Ranjith Abeysinghe due to his

connections to senior officers of the Police and politicians and further alleges that

the disciplinary inquiry was held contrary to the Police Departmental Order A7

(Annex 1).

With regard to the first aspect of the complaint of the Petitioner, it would be

pertinent to consider the position taken up by Ranjith Abeysinghe at the inquiry.

In his statement (to the S.P. Ganeshanadan) he had said that he holds the post of

General Manager (Sales) at C.I.C Agro Industries and had admitted that he was

at the wheel of the vehicle, in question. He had also admitted that he was driving

the vehicle after consuming liquor and that he was not in possession of a driving

license at the time. He also had stated that he got various individuals, including

Senior Police Officers, Secretaries to various Ministries and Judicial Officers to

6

speak to the Police to resolve this issue without proceeding with the matter any

further. Abeysinghe says the Petitioner did not heed to any of them, but informed

him that he would be prosecuted.

Although the conduct of Abeysinghe is not in issue in these proceedings, it must

be noted that Abeysinghe’s conduct cannot be condoned and certainly

unbecoming of one purportedly holding such a position in a prestigious

organisation like C.I.C. Abeysinghe had a moral obligation to assist the Petitioner

in the conduct of his investigation when he was found driving a vehicle without

his license and having consumed alcohol to the detriment of the other road

users. Not only had he committed a serious misdeed by attempting to interfere

with the course of justice, but had also refused to take the Breathalyzer test

which all law abiding citizens are required to undertake when requested by the

law enforcement.

The Petitioner alleges that Abeysinghe was motivated by his refusal to drop the

prosecution, without causing an embarrassment. He alleges further that the

decision to demote him was also due to Ranjith Abeysinghe’s influence.

At the inquiry, Abeysinghe and some others who gave evidence had referred to

the foul language the Petitioner is alleged to have used in addressing Abeysinghe.

The words are too offensive to be quoted in a judgment.

Abeysinghe had a duty to assist a police officer in the discharge of the duties in

view of the fact that not only were the charges serious, he had also admitted them

and pleaded guilty in court. Instead, he not only refused to take the Breathalyzer

test, but attempted to prevail upon the Petitioner not to perform his duty.

Further, he had aggravated the matter of getting others who were in authority

7

and who he thought could influence the Petitioner in the performance of his

duties, to speak to him. Abeysinghe in his statement to the Inquiry Officer (R1)

had said even after he came to Colombo he phoned the Petitioner and asked

whether the case could be dropped.

Given the nature of the human mind, it is quite possible that the conduct of

Abeysinghe and his acquaintances would have irked the Petitioner.

The Petitioner being a police officer, however, is required to act without getting

ruffled even in the face of such reactions by the public and is expected to

perform his duties in a dignified manner and cannot under any circumstances

afford to use disparaging language. It had been pointed out by the 11th

Respondent that the Petitioner had been previously found guilty of such

misconduct and had been dealt with disciplinary (R4). Perusal of R4, however,

reveals it had been an incident subsequent to the one referred to in these

proceedings. Thus, it appears that there had been no similar complaints against

the Petitioner up to the date of the impugned incident which was the 7th

November, 2009.

The Petitioner in this application had sought, among other reliefs, to have, the

charge sheet and the findings of the disciplinary held against him declared null

and void on the basis that the inquiry had been conducted contrary to the Police

Departmental Order A7 (P15b)

The Petitioner had subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the inquiry and if he

was of the opinion that the constitution of the inquiry was not in conformity with

the applicable rules, it was up to him to raise the issue as a preliminary matter.

In Rathnayake vs. Attorney General 1997 2 SLR pg. 98 Chief Justice G.P.S. De

Silva held that every wrongful act is not sufficient grounds to complaint of an

8

infringement of fundamental rights. The Petitioner must establish unequal or

discriminatory treatment.

It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the

Disciplinary Order, by which the Petitioner was demoted to the rank of

constable, was excessive under the circumstances of the case and contrary to the

principles of fairness and proportionality.

It was further submitted that the Deputy Inspector General of Nuwara Eliya,

upon receiving the disciplinary findings against the Petitioner, recommended

that one increment of the Petitioner’s salary be deferred. The Respondents have

not denied this assertion, although there is no document before us, to that effect.

The 11th Respondent in his Disciplinary order (P13) had taken into account the

importance of maintaining discipline within the Police Department and that

the manner in which the Petitioner has conducted himself is not a conduct that

is expected of, by the public. The 11th Respondent, however, does not appear to

have taken into account the mitigatory factors in favour of the Petitioner referred

to above, which the 11th Respondent ought to have considered prior to deciding

on the punishment that was to be meted out to the Petitioner. In that context, I

am of the view the Petitioner had been denied the protection of the law envisaged

in article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioners' fundamental right enshrined in article 12

(1) of the Constitution has been violated by the 11th Respondent.

Accordingly the Disciplinary Order P13 is quashed and this court directs the

Inspector General of Police to impose a punishment that is commensurate with

the disciplinary breaches, the Petitioner had been found guilty o after

considering the aggravating factors as well as migratory factors favourable to the

Petitioner.
