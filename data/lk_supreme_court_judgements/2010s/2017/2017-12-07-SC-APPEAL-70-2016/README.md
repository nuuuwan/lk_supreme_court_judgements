GOONERATNE J. This is an appeal in an action in ejectment by the Plaintiffs and the

1st Plaintiff being the landlady and the 2nd Plaintiff, the owner of the premises in

dispute. The question that arises for decision is whether the 2nd Defendant was

a sub-tenant and whether sub-tenancy has been established. At the hearing of

this appeal the other question of unauthorised alterations was not taken up for

argument and learned counsel of both parties did not press on this issue. At the

trial it had been admitted that:

(a) Premises in dispute is subject to the Rent Act of 1972

(b) Premises in dispute is No. 88

(c) It is a business premises

(d) That the person called ‘Alice’ expired

The learned District Judge of Homagama held in favour of the Plaintiffs,

but, the Civil Appellate High Court set aside the Judgment of the District Court.

This court on 21.03.2016 granted Leave to Appeal on the following two

questions of law.

(1) Did the Honourable High Court Judge err in not taking into consideration

the totality of the evidence, both documentary and oral in coming into

the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have not established the burden of

establishing a sub tenancy?

5

(2) Did the Honourable High court Judges err in not taking into consideration,

that once the 2nd Defendant admits that he is in possession, and the 1st

Defendant is claimed by the Plaintiff to be the tenant; then the burden is

on the 2nd Defendant to show that he is in occupation on a different basis

other than of a sub tenant?

Parties proceeded to trial on 29 issues. There is no specific admission on

ownership of the property in dispute which was not contested by the Defendant

party. The 2nd Defendant got title to the property from her grand-parents and

parents. The 1st Plaintiff was the 2nd Plaintiff’s mother. It is also noted that the

2nd Defendant did not appeal to the High Court from the Judgment of the learned

District Judge.

The premises in dispute is situated in the heart of Kottawa town,

which is a business premises. Alice the grand-mother of 2nd Plaintiff died on

02.05.1998. After her death the property vested on the 2nd Plaintiff absolutely.

2nd Plaintiff was a student at that time and the 1st Plaintiff, the mother of 2nd

Plaintiff collected rents as landlady from 1st Defendant and continued to rent

out the premises to the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant in or about June 2000

did certain structural alterations without any consent or permission of the 1st

Plaintiff and also subsequently sub-let the premises to the 2nd Defendant. In

brief the above is the version of the Plaintiffs.

6

The case of the Defendants was that one Don Ranasinghe the 2nd

Defendant’s father was the tenant of the premises in dispute for over 50 years

and was carrying on business of a eating joint (wdmk Yd,dj) on 26.06.1932 the

above R.W. Ranasinghe handed over the business to the 2nd Defendant. The 1st

Defendant too was involved in the business and the question of sub-letting does

not arise. Whilst the trial was proceeding the 1st Defendant died and in his place

the wife, son and daughter 1A, 1B & 1C Defendants-Appellant-Respondents

were substituted. Defendant party relies heavily on the Judgment of Perera Vs.

Seneviratne 77 NLR 402 which held that the land lord who pleads sub-tenancy

has to discharge the burden by proving that some person occupied premises and

also paid rent for his occupation. Learned counsel for the Defendant-

Respondent relies on Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance. Learned counsel

also argued that the 1st Defendant was not the tenant, and it was the 2nd

Defendant who was the tenant.

It is important to ascertain the correct tenant of the 1st Plaintiff. In

this connection the 1st Plaintiff produced counter foils of the rent receipts issued

to the 1st Defendant. It was marked and produced as me5 and me6. I find that the

learned trial Judge has given her mind to same and arrived at the conclusion by

accepting both me5 and me6 to be genuine (Pg. 4 of Judgment and folio 539) on

the other hand the Defendants produce V2 – V5 to prove that a partnership was

7

carried on between 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant’s father who was one

William Ranasinghe from the year 1943, as ‘Ranasiri Hotel’. The business

registration was produced as V3 but no rent receipts produced by the Defendant

party. Documents V2 is a tax evasion letter by William Ranasinghe from the

Income Tax Department. Address of same is ‘Ranasiri’ Hotel. V3 is a business

registration of 1983. V4 is a document from the Local Authority on payment of

Rates. V5 is a loan application to the People’s Bank. All these have been

produced by the Defendant party to establish a partnership business and the

Address (not clear).

Trial Judge observed that no rent receipts were produced by the

Defendant party nor was 2nd Defendant or his father was called to give evidence.

I observe that the best method to prove tenancy is to produce the rent receipts

which the Plaintiff has done. I also note that the learned trial Judge has

disbelieved the stance taken by the Defendant party. (Folio 540)

The question of the best evidence to be led is discussed in the case

of Jayawardena Vs. Wanigasekera 1985 (1) SLR 125. It is the rent receipt. As such

the position of the Defendants that the 2nd Defendant was the tenant is rejected

by this court and the court below, the District Court. The trial Judge has correctly

dealt with this position in the Judgment at folio 541 of the record. As such the

tenant of the premises in dispute was the 1st Defendant, and to say it was the

8

2nd Defendant was nothing but an attempt to mislead court. I also observe that

the Civil Appellate Court has in view of the created confusion by the Defendant

party as to who was the tenant, was under a duty to examine this position prior

to deciding on the issue of sub-tenancy.

It is not the function of an Appellate Court to re-write the evidence,

but in a given circumstances it is desirable to consider the evidence and decide

whether the lower court has properly applied the evidence to the facts of the

case and decide on the law. The 1st Plaintiff in her evidence at folio 444

categorically stated that from 2001 January the business of the rented out

premises was not continuously carried out and it was closed. Employees were

found and she came to know that the 1st Defendant was ill. The 1st Defendant

having recovered from the illness paid the arrears of rent. It was further stated

by this Plaintiff that the shop was closed but some renovations were being done.

She inspected the premises and found some bed and some furniture brought

into the premises. A ceiling had been fixed, floor broken, walls erected within

the premises and work was in progress. All this evidence is found at folios 445

to 447. At folio 446 evidence reveal 1st Plaintiff noticed an extension to the

kitchen and an encroachment of land from behind. On sub-letting the following

evidence noted. Plaintiff met Yahampath (1st Defendant) and asked him what

was all this.

The above evidence remains uncontradicted.

At pg. 17 and folio 485 it is in evidence that the 2nd Defendant sent

the rent by post but the Plaintiff returned it. Ranasinghe is at present doing

business in the shop. At folio 457 the evidence is that the 2nd Defendant is having

a pastry shop. I would at this point prefer to refer to the case of Samad Vs.

Samsudeen and another 2003(2) SLR 235 per Somawansa J. “Burden of proving

subletting is with the Plaintiff-Respondent. However once the Plaintiff proves

that the premises had been in the exclusive occupation of a 3rd party other than

a tenant as in the instant case in the absence of any explanation by the tenant

10

or the 3rd party showing that there is no subletting court has to draw the

presumption that it is a case of subletting by the tenant to the 3rd party”.

It is so in the case in hand. Defendant party has taken pains to

establish partnership. Renovation done without Plaintiff’s consent. There is 1st

Defendant’s own evidence that 2nd Defendant took over the business. Further

Plaintiff’s uncontradicted evidence on this point is relevant. All this shows

subletting. 2nd Defendant never gave evidence. That would have been of great

assistance to court if evidence was given by the 2nd Defendant. As such court

could draw adverse inference and draw the presumption available by law. Court

may presume existence of certain facts (Section 114 of Evidence Ordinance).

Illustration (F) is relevant to the circumstances of this case.

In an action instituted by a landlord to eject his tenant on the

grounds that the tenant has sublet a portion of the rented premises, the land-

lord’s evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of subletting, the

burden is on the tenant to furnish evidence in rebuttal. In the case in hand the

Defendant party failed to lead any evidence in this regard.

In Seyed Mohamed Vs. Meera Pillai 70 NLR 237

The question was whether the defendant had, in contravention of section 9 of the

Rent Restriction Act, sub-let a part of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. The evidence

disclosed that one A.C was in sole and exclusive occupation of a room of the premises and

that he carried on business in that room. The defendant took up the position that no rent was

11

paid to him by A.C and that the latter had been let into occupation of the room before the

defendant became the tenant of the premises.

Held, that, in the absence of acceptable evidence to explain A.C’s occupation, the only

inference was that A.C was in occupation as a sub-tenant paying rent to the defendant.

Held further, that, where sub-letting is continued, there is a continued breach by the

tenant of the statutory provision against sub-letting.

Azhar Vs. Fernando 76 NLR 118

Where in an action instituted by a landlord to eject his tenant on the ground that the

tenant has sublet a portion of the rented premises, the landlord’s evidence is sufficient to

establish a prima facie case of subletting, the burden is then on the tenant to furnish evidence

in rebuttal.

The learned High Court Judges have failed to consider the position

that as stated above the burden is on the Defendant party to give cogent reasons

and discharge that burden. To decide on subletting the true nature of the

transaction by parties and totality of surrounding circumstances would be

decisive to determine such position. I am of the view that the so called

partnership suggested by Defendants was another crafty attempt of the

Defendant party to take the court on a long path to create some confusion,

similar situation was considered in Abdul Latiff Vs. Seyed Mohamed 72 NLR 20.

Held when a tenant of a rent controlled premises enters into a “partnership”

agreement with a person in relation to the premises but such agreement is only

12

a blind to cover the subletting of the premises, the tenant and subtenant are

liable to be ejected if the landlord has not given his permission.

The learned District Judge has very carefully analysed the evidence

and the facts of this case. In that Judgment at folio 545 of the brief it is stated

that the Defendant in their written submissions had admitted the Plaintiff’s

documents produced at the trial. Trial Judge observes that Plaintiff’s evidence

on the point is genuine and no reason to doubt it. It is stated that the 2nd

Defendant got into the business by the later part of 1999. At this stage the trial

Judge refer to the evidence on point and makes observation of sub-tenancy, it

is correct in the context of the case in hand. It is as follows:

In all the facts and circumstances of this case I set aside the

Judgment of the High Court and affirm the Judgment of the learned District

Judge. I answer the questions of law as ‘Yes’ in the affirmative. The trial Judge

has correctly dealt with all primary facts. I see no valid basis to interfere with

same, vide 1993(1) SLR 119; 20 NLR 332; 20 NLR 282. The effect of Sections 10(2)

and 10(5) of the Rent Act No. 1972 is that unauthorised sub-letting of premises

falling within the purview of the Act, by the tenant to a third party, confers on

the landlord or landlady as the case may be, the right to a decree for ejectment

of the tenant and sub-tenant.

14

I Order costs payable by the Substituted Defendants to both

Plaintiffs in a sum of Rs. 100,000/- and to be paid to each of the Plaintiffs the

said sum of Rs. 100,000/-.

Appeal allowed as above with costs.
