Before: : Sisira J. de Abrew, J Nalin Perera, J & Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J Counsel: : Walter Perera for the Petitioner.

Saliya Pieris with Lisitha Sachindra for the 1st, 3rd and 5th

Respondents.

Ms. Induni Punchihewa SC for the A.G.

Argued & Decided on: : 17.01.2017 Sisira J. de Abrew, J Heard counsel for both sides in support of their respective cases. The Petitioner

by his amended petition alleges that his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 11 and 12(1)

of the Constitution have been violated by the Respondents. This Court, by its order dated

21.11.2013, granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Constitution

against the 1st ,3rd and 5th Respondents. We note that the Court did not grant leave to proceed

3

for alleged violation under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Petitioner in his amended petition

states that the 1st,3rd and 5th Respondents arrested the Petitioner in front of his business

establishment and assaulted the Petitioner. The Petitioner further states that this assault was

witnessed by the members of the general pubic. We note that no member of the general public

has tendered an affidavit to this Court supporting the above position taken up by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner, in his amended petition, further states that he was assaulted and

tortured by the 1st , 3rd and 5th Respondents at the Divisional Crime Investigation Unit. He, in

paragraph 10 of the affidavit filed in this Court, states that the assault/torture at the said

Divisional Crime Investigation Unit was witnessed by G.A. Hemantha Perera and G.A.

Rathnasiri Perera who were his brothers. But surprisingly the said Hemantha Perera and

Rathnasiri Perera in their affidavits marked P8 and P9 do not support the said version of the

Petitioner.

They in their affidavits state that they came to know from his brother who was at

the police station that he was assaulted and tortured by the police officers. When we consider

the paragraph 10 of his affidavit filed in this Court and the two affidavits tendered by

Hemantha Perera and Rathnasiri Perera, we hold that the Court can't place any reliance on the

amended petition of the petitioner filed in this Court. The Petitioner has tendered a report by

the Judicial Medical Officer. In the said report the said JMO states the following facts under the

heading of 'opinions and recommendations'.

1) He had blunt force trauma to his right loin region in a form of a contusion ( Bruising)

2) Such a bruising can be sustained due to a blow from a fist as well as hitting with a blunt

4

object.

3) That injury is compatible with the blow given to him as described by him in the history.

4) Such an injury can also be caused if his loin was hit against a blunt object too.

5) The injury was non grievous in nature.

6) It can heal without any further treatment.

7) As he is said to be a person with high blood pressure and diabetes, he has to continue his

medications and has to take his diabetic foods.

8) If he develops any new complains, he has to be taken to a hospital without delay.

9) He has to be revived periodically by his doctor for his high blood pressure and diabetes.

We note that the JMO also made the following observations.

“ Contusion, 3cmx 2 cm over the right loin area on lower ribs. There was no pain elicited while

pressing the ribs away from the contusion. No other fresh injuries were found elsewhere in the

body.”

The said JMO had examined the Petitioner at 4.30 p.m. on 04.05.2012. The

arrest was also on the same day around 11 a.m. Thereafter the Petitioner was produced before

the learned Magistrate. On submissions made by his counsel, the learned Magistrate has made

an order to obtain a medical report from the Prison Doctor of Negombo Prison. The Prison

Doctor attached to Negombo Prison has submitted a report dated 07.05.2014 marked P4. The

said Doctor had stated in the said report that there were no external injuries or visible

contusion on the body of the Petitioner.

When we consider all the above matters, we are unable to conclude that the

5

Petitioner had been assaulted and tortured by the Police Officers. Petitioner’s version stated in

paragraph 10 of his affidavit is not supported by his own brothers' affidavits.

For the above reasons, we hold that there is no concrete evidence before this

Court to conclude that the Petitioner had been assaulted by the 1st, 3rd and 5th Respondents as

alleged by the Petitioner. We therefore hold that there is no merit in the petition of the

Petitioner.

For the above reasons, we dismiss the Petition of the Petitioner. No costs.
