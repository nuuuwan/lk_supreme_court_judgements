ARGUED ON: 27.06.2017 DECIDED ON: 08.12.2017 GOONERATNE J. This was a rent and ejectment action filed on or about 1978 in the

District Court of Negombo. The premises in question is situated at No 131,

Negombo Road, Rilaulla, Kandana. Judgment was entered by the District Court

in favour of the Appellant and in terms of Section 22(1) (c ) of the Rent Act, a

further order was made by the learned District Judge, that before the Writ of

Execution is issued by court, directing the Commissioner of National Housing to

provide alternate accommodation to the Tenant-Respondent. There was in fact

no appeal against the judgment of the District Court. It is the position of the

Appellant that representations were made by him to the Commissioner to

provide alternate accommodation to the Respondent so that he could execute

the decree. It is also stated that the original Respondent expired and the

Plaintiff-Appellant substituted the wife of the Respondent on 24.02.1987 in his

place.

3

The material furnished to court suggest that the Commissioner of

National Housing by letter dated 17.02.1997 informed the Registrar, District

Court of Negombo that the Commissioner is in a position to provide an alternate

house from the Divulapitiya, Walpita Housing Scheme which is reserved for the

tenant. Thereafter the Appellant moved court and sought a Writ of Execution

and also prayed for the issue of notice under Section 377 of the Civil Procedure

Code, and in the said application Substituted-Defendant-Petitioner sought an

order from court to reject the application of the Plaintiff-Appellant

The Respondent objected to allowing a Writ of Execution and after

inquiry, District Court allowed the application for writ and the learned District

Judge by order of 19.01.2001 made order allowing the writ subject to conditions.

The Respondent being aggrieved by the District Court Order sought Leave to

Appeal and Court of Appeal having granted leave, consequently by order of

25.05.2005 set aside the order of the District Court. The Supreme Court on or

about 28.11.2005 granted Special Leave to Appeal on question of law set out in

paragraph 32 (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) & (vii) of the petition dated 30.06.2005. It reads

thus:

(i) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in applying the principles laid down

in case Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya 1987 (2) SLR 292?

4

(ii) Did the alternate accommodation provided by the Commissioner in

accordance with the provisions laid down in Section 22 (1) (c) of the

Rent Act as amended?

(iii) In terms of Section 22 (1) (c) of the Rent (Amendment) Act No. 26 of

2002 are the principles laid down in the case Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya

still in force?

(vi) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that, the agreement referred is

a Rent Purchase agreement?

(vii) In any event is the judgment in Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya correctly

decided?

Parties to this suit had been litigating since 1978. Judgment was entered

in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellant in 1980, by the District Court. Thereafter the

case record went missing from 1987 and later reconstructed by an Order of

Court. The substituted-Defendant-Petitioner support the Judgment of the Court

of Appeal and further state that the Court of Appeal correctly followed the

Judgment in Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya 1987 2 SLR 287 ... that purported

notification on the basis of which the writ had been issued did not constitute

“alternate accommodation” as required by Section 22(1) (c) of the Rent Act

inasmuch as it was on hire purchase and not tenancy. Defendant also argue that

purported notification is bad in law as the notification does not state that

alternate accommodation was available for the tenant, and in the contrary it

5

states that alternate accommodation is available to the Plaintiff, landlord. It is

bad in law and invalid.

Section 22 (b) of the Rent Act reads thus:

Such premises are in the opinion of the court, reasonably required for occupation as

a residence for the landlord, or any member of the family of the landlord, or for the

purposes of the trade, business, profession, vocation or employment of the landlord,

and such landlord has deposited, prior to the institution of such action or proceedings

a sum equivalent to ten years’ rent or rupees one hundred and fifty thousand,

whichever is higher, with the Commissioner for National Housing and has cause notice

of such action or proceedings to be served on the Commissioner: or” :

I will at this point of my Judgment consider the Court of Appeal

Judgment and the applicability of the case of Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya which

was a Judgment in a Writ Application, and different to the case in hand. In order

to clarify the position I will incorporate the operative part of the Court of Appeal

Judgment which relied heavily by the Defendant on Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya,

only. The following to be noted.

At the inquiry into the notification in the present case, all the evidence clearly

establishes that the alternative accommodation offered is not on rent basis but on

rent purchase basis and the expected occupation of the premises offered is in a

character of a rent-purchaser and not of a tenant. In such circumstances, following

rule in the decision of Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya (Supra) the learned District Judge

could not hold that the premises offered is “alternative accommodation” in the sense

of the provisions of Rent Act and specially section 22 (1C) and ought not in law to have

allowed the application for the issue of writ of execution of the decree. The learned

District Judge has erred in law in holding that what was offered is “alternative

accommodation” and consequently basing his decision to allow the writ of execution.

6

The evidence was led of the Plaintiff and two officers of the

National Housing and Development Authority at the inquiry before the District

Judge pertaining to the writ of execution. Plaintiff’s evidence suggest that

agreement to purchase the house at Divulapitiya, Walpita Housing Scheme

(alternate house made available to the tenant) is between the Plaintiff-

Appellant and the Commissioner of National Housing for Rs. 250,000/- . Plaintiff

paid Rs.50,000/- initially and thereafter paid 18 instalements. The Court of

Appeal has merely applied the case of Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya without

considering the evidence led at the inquiry. I will refer to certain extracts of

Plaintiff’s evidence. At Pg. 66 & 67 I note the following evidence.

At Pg. 153 of the proceedings which refer to a letter to the

Registrar of the District Court from the Commissioner of National Housing

clearly states that a house has been reserved, and will be complied with in

terms of the order of the District Judge .... “by; ;Skaoqj wkqj lghq;= l,

Though communication by the Commissioner came rather late it is

clear that the house is reserved for the tenant. An Assistant Commissioner who

gave evidence had this to state, in court.

The Court of Appeal Judgment has not considered the evidence

led at the inquiry and merely arrives at a conclusion based on submission of

counsel and the decision in Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya. The said Judgment has

no application at all to the case in hand, especially in the light of evidence that

the premises is reserved for the tenant.

On perusing the judgment of Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya it is stated

.. where judgment for ejectment of the tenant had been made it is special

concern to protect tenants in occupation of premises whose standard rent does

not exceed Rs. 100/-. Hence a purposive interpretation of the statute to give

effect to the intention of the legislature should be adopted. ..... reasonably

required for occupation as a residence of the landlord or a member of the family

writ to issue only after the Commissioner of National Housing has notified the

court that he is able to provide alternative accommodation to the tenants. The

alternative accommodation should, in view of the social objective of the Act,

have some relevance to the needs and circumstances of the tenant so as not to

render the offer of alternative accommodation illusory and unmeaningful: the

accommodation offered must be habitable and appropriate to the tenant ... It

9

must be roughly comparable with the existing accommodation in basic

amenities.

I cannot certainly agree with the above first part of the judgment. I

could only agree with above, only from the point of ‘habitable and appropriate’

to the tenant. In this regard the Plaintiff as well as the other witnesses testified

that, the alternative accommodation provided is a house on a 14 perch land and

the house equipped with electricity and water supply and other amenities. It is

close to Divulapitiya town. These are all uncontradicted evidence. A house in the

nature of the tenants requirements should have basic amenities. Any utility

items basic for human habitation must be available, without luxuries. That

should be the standard that is required. In todays’ context it can be any basis

and rent basis is preferred.

In all the above circumstances I would answer the question of law

as follows in favour of Plaintiff-Appellant.

(i) Yes

(ii) Yes

(iii) Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya does not apply to the case in hand in its

entirety.

(iv) In view of the answers to above, it does not arise

(v) Same as (iv) above

10

Mowjood Vs. Pussadeniya was decided 40 years ago, we are today living

in a very modern society, notwithstanding the poverty that has crept into the

society. I am not in a position to adopt the principles laid down in the above case

to the case in hand. Delay that has taken place at various level of courts and the

delay of the Commissioner of National Housing to provide alternative

accommodation is unfortunate and regrettable. I affirm the Order of the learned

District Judge dated 19.01.2001 and I set aside the judgment of the Court of

Appeal. The Substituted-Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner and the Plaintiff-

Respondent (Judgment-Creditor) to comply with learned District Judges’ Order

subject to the conditions that the tenant, once the keys to the premises are

accepted the tenant should within 6 weeks vacate the premises in dispute and

occupy the premises allocated. If any change of circumstances have occurred

tenant to notify the District Court, by motion to enable the District Judge to deal

with it.

Appeal allowed without costs.
