But whether the 7th defendant\u2019s father and thereafter the 7th defendant acquired prescriptive title to the adjacent land which was to the South of the lot 1, which is depicted as lot 2 in the said preliminary plan is the main issue to be looked into in this case. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court too has held that it is clear that consequent to the execution of the deed marked P7 dated 19.01.1920 Appuhamy\u2019s co-ownership was terminated. And that he cannot be treated as a co-owner of the property thereafter. The Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court has further held that although the said Appuhamy\u2019s co-ownership was terminated resultant to the deed marked P7 executed in 1920 it is manifest that he never surrendered his possession to the vendee or any other person and continued to possess the said land as a co-owner. The said Court has further held that it is abundantly clear that the 7th defendant\u2019s party had possessed the land for more than 65 years prior to the bringing of the action in 1985.Further the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court has held that the 7th defendant is entitled to track on to his father\u2019s possession for the purpose of establishing such claim based on prescription. In my view the evidence led by the 7th defendant in this case does not support that position. The 7th defendant-respondent has given evidence and stated that his father lived in lot 1 and that he too was born in the said house in lot 1 in plan X. The survey plan marked X and report mark X1 clearly shows that there are buildings which were claimed by the 7th defendant. The 7th defendant\u2019s age at the time he gave evidence before the District Court in this case on 12.06.2006 was 56 years. Therefore he was born only in the year 1950. He in his evidence has admitted that in 1916 by the deed",

The said Sumanasara Thero thereafter transferred the said rights to Ranmalhamy by deed marked P8 in 1928. The said father of the 7th defendant-respondent therefore had seized to be a co-owner of the said land called Polgahakumbura in 1920. That is about 36 years prior to the birth of the 7th defendant. But the 7th defendant\u2019s father continued to live in lot 1 of the preliminary plan marked X and the 7th defendant-respondent was born in the house in the said lot 1 and continued to live there with his father until his father\u2019s death in 1958. Thus it is very clear from the evidence of the 7th defendant that he was only 8 years old at the time of his father\u2019s death. The brother of his father, Ranmalhamy has died in 1960 two years after the death of Appuhamy. Therefore the 7th defendant evidence clearly shows that he has remained in the house of Appuhamy as a child and he and the other family members of Appuhamy continued to live and possess lot 1 in the said preliminary plan after the death of Appuhamy. It is clear from the evidence given by the 6th defendant that the 7th defendant thereafter demolished his ancestral home which was situated in lot 1 of the preliminary plan and built a new up stair house in the same location and continued to possess the same. The 7th defendant\u2019s father Appuhamy became a co-owner of the land called Polgahakumbura only in the year 1916 by deed marked P6 and seized to be a co-owner of the said land after 1920 when he sold his rights to Sumanasara Thero in 1920. All these things happened thirty years prior to the birth of the 7th defendant in 1950. Therefore the evidence of the 7th defendant that his father possessed and acquired prescriptive title to the said Eastern \u00bd portion of the lot 2 in the preliminary plan and he too continued to possess and",

    "text": "The learned District Judge had very correctly held in his judgment that the 7th Defendant-Respondent has failed to prove prescriptive title to lot No.2 in preliminary plan marked X. In Sirajudeen and Others V. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri.L.R 365, it was held that:- \u201cWhere a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive title.\u201d As regards mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses that the defendant possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by court. One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be such character as is incompatible with the title of the owner. In my view in the present case there is significant absence of clear and specific evidence on such acts of possession as would entitle the 7th defendant-appellant to a decree in favour in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. The findings of facts by the learned District Judge are mainly based on the trial Judge\u2019s evaluation of facts. I have considered the entire judgment and see no reason to interfere and the trial Judge has given cogent reasons. The trial Judge has arrived at a correct conclusion. An Appellate Court should not without cogent reasons interfere with primary facts. For the above reasons I see no reason to disturb the judgment of the learned District Judge. Accordingly I answer questions of law raised in the instant case in the following manner.",
