This an appeal from a Partition Decree entered in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent by the High Court of Civil Appeal which set aside the judgment previously entered by the District Court in favour of the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner/Appellant. The only question to be decided in this appeal is whether the learned High Court Judges erred in law by failing to consider the documents produced in evidence at the trial by the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner/Appellant and basing their decision solely on the absence of proof of the document marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d, which is said to be the Last Will of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva. The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (\u201cthe plaintiff\u201d) filed this case, in the District Court of Galle, against the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner/Appellant and the 2nd and to 3rd Defendants-Respondents-Respondents above named, praying to partition the land called \u201cKirammawaththa addara Ketakalagahawatta\u201d also known as \u201cKahatagahawatta\u201d, which is situated at Kathaluwa village in the Galle District.

In her judgment, the learned District Judge upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the aforesaid 11/90th share of the land originating from S.V.A.Peter and set out in the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd06\u201d and also referred to the fact that, the defendants did not dispute these deeds at the trial.

Next, the learned District Judge upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the aforesaid 1/12th share of the land originating from G.V.Carlinahamy and set out in the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d and also referred to the fact that, the defendants did not challenge these deeds at the trial and that the 1st defendant had admitted the plaintiff\u2019s claim to this 1/12th share. In this connection, the learned District Judge concluded \u201c\u0d91\u0dd9\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dd9 \u0da9\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d85\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dc5 \u0d89\u0da9\u0db8\u0dda \u0db8 \u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd9\u0daf\u0dd6 1/12 \u0db4\u0d82\u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db4\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0da7 \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dd2 \u0dc0 \u0dd9\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0dad\u0dd3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd2\u201d.

    "text": "However, with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the aforesaid further 1/12th share and 11/45th share originating from the title of S. Ranis Appu in respect of which the plaintiff had produced the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd017\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd019\u201d, the learned District Judge held that, the plaintiff has not proved that, S.Ranis Appu had title to the said 1/12th share and 11/45th share . Thus, the learned District Judge has expressly held that, the plaintiff had established his entitlement to the 11/90th share originating from S.V.Peter, the 1/12th share originating from G.V.Carlinahamy and the 11/45th share of the land originating from S. Andiris, S. Rosalin and S.Charlie, as averred in the plaint and upon the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd016\u201d. With regard to the 1st defendant, the learned District Judge observed that, unlike the plaintiff who had not traced his ownership back to an owner of the entire land, the title claimed by the 1st defendant could be traced back to a single owner of the entire land - namely, the aforesaid Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva who had died leaving the Last Will produced marked by the 1st defendant marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. The learned District Judge held that, the evidence established that this Last Will had been administered in D.C.Galle Testamentary Case No. 3268 and that the Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d established that, the land which is the subject matter of this case was part of the estate of the late Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva which had been administered in that case. The learned District Judge did comment on the fact that, the 1st defendant failed to prove that probate had issued in D.C.Galle Testamentary Case No. 3268 and that the 1st defendant failed to lead evidence to establish the manner in which the properties which formed the estate were dealt with or distributed. However, the learned District Judge appears to have taken the view that, since the case record had perished, the Court was entitled to proceed on the assumption that, the land which is the subject matter of this case had come to the three heirs named in the Last Will in the manner set out earlier - ie: 1/2 share to G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, 1/4 share to G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and 1/4 share to Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva. On the aforesaid basis, the learned District Judge concluded that, the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d proved that, Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva was the sole owner of the land and that, the land was thereafter, transferred to his heirs, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva, in the aforesaid shares. Thereafter, the learned District Judge held that, the deeds produced by the 1st defendant marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d to \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d established that, the 1st defendant had become entitled to the 29/48th share of the land which the 1st defendant prayed for in her Statement of Claim. Although, as set out above, the learned District Judge had previously determined that, the plaintiff had established his entitlement to a 11/90th share, 1/12th share and",

Only the plaintiff and the defendant were represented when the appeal was argued. In appeal, the learned High Court Judges observed that, although the learned District Judge had first determined that, the plaintiff had established his entitlement to a 11/90th share originating from S.V.Peter, 1/12th share originating from G.V.Carlinahamy and a 11/45th share originating from S. Andiris, S. Rosalin and S.Charlie, upon the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 16\u201d, the learned District Judge had proceeded to later hold that, the plaintiff was entitled only to the 4/48th [ie:1/12th share] originating from G.V.Carlinahamy, which the 1st defendant had admitted. The learned High Court Judges held that, the 1st defendant\u2019s claim in this action was based entirely on the 1st defendant\u2019s position that, the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and the Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d established that Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva was the sole owner of the land and that, upon his death, the land devolved upon his heirs, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva, in the aforesaid shares in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. The learned High Court Judges held that, however, the mere production of the Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d did not prove that the land which is the subject matter of the action was the land described in the Inventory since the Inventory did not contain a description of the metes and bounds of the land. The learned High Court Judges further observed that there was a discrepancy between the name of the land as stated in the pleadings and the name of the lands listed in the Inventory since the corpus is identified in the present action as the land called \u201cKirammawaththaaddara Ketakalagahawatta also known as Kahatagahawatta\u201d while the Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d lists one land named \u201cKirammawatta addera Ketakalagahawattte\u201d and another land \u201cKetakalagahawatta alias Kahahatagahawatta\u201d.

The learned High Court Judges went on to hold that, the 1st defendant\u2019s failure to produce the probate which is said to have been issued in D.C.Galle Testamentary Case No. 3268 and the 1st defendant\u2019s failure to even lead secondary evidence to establish that a probate had been issued in the manner set out in the Last Will, led to the conclusion that the 1st defendant has failed to prove that, the heirs of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva \u2013 namely, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva \u2013 became entitled to the land in the aforesaid shares in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22. In this connection, the learned High Court Judges referred to the case of DAVOODBHOY vs. FAROOK [63 NLR 97] where Basnayake CJ held (at p.107) \u201cThere being no proof that the Will No. 418 (P2) has been admitted to Probate it cannot be acted on as the Last Will of the deceased.\u201d In this connection, it is relevant to observe that, the certified copies of the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d produced by the 1st defendant have been issued by the District Court in 1991 and 1987 \u2013 ie: a relatively short period before this action was filed. In that background, a question arises as to why the 1st defendant did not obtain and produce a certified copy of the probate. With regard to the deeds marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d to \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d produced by the 1st defendant in support of her claim, the learned High Court Judge observed that, although the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d is dated 04th November 1896 and Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d is dated 23rd March 1899, the oldest deed produced by the 1st defendant is \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d which is dated 17th July 1961. The learned High Court Judge further observed that, none of the deeds produced by the 1st defendant could be connected, on the face of these deeds, to the title which the 1st defendant claims was originally held by Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva and, after his death, devolved upon his heirs - G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva. On the aforesaid basis, the learned High Court Judges held that, the 1st defendant had failed to prove her entitlement to the 29/48th share she claimed and that the learned District Judge had erred when she entered judgment as prayed for in the 1st defendant\u2019s Statement of Claim. With regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the High Court held that, the plaintiff had established his entitlement to the 11/90th share originating from S.V.Peter, 1/12th share originating from G.V.Carlinahamy and a 11/45th share originating from S. Andiris, S. Rosalin and S.Charlie, upon the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 16\u201d and that, the 1st defendant had not succeeded in disputing or disproving that entitlement.

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judges affirmed the learned District Judge\u2019s determination that, the said 1/12th share and 11/45th share should remain unallotted.

Finally, the learned High Court Judges held that, the learned District Judge correctly determined that the 2nd and 3rd defendants had failed to establish any entitlement to the land.

In these circumstances, the 1st defendant should have produced a copy of the probate which is said to have been issued in D.C.Galle Testamentary Case No. 3268. It should be mentioned here that, a copy of this probate is said to have been produced in evidence in D.C.Galle Case No. 6130/P to which the 1st defendant was a party, as evidenced by the proceedings of that case which were marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd024\u201d. However, the fact that, the probate was produced in the earlier case no. 6130/P did not absolve the 1st defendant from the obligation to produce the probate in the present case. It should also be mentioned here that, the proceedings marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd024\u201d show that, the plaintiff in the earlier case no. 6130/P produced a Deed No. 3123 dated 23rd November 1988 by which Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva obtained title to the land named \u201cThalakoratuwa\u201d which was the subject matter of that case. However, the 1st defendant failed to produce such a deed in the present case to prove that Lokuge Don Adiriyan de Silva had sole title to the land which is the subject matter of the action. Further, in light of the discrepancy between the name of the land which is the subject matter of this case and the names of two separate lands in the Inventory marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d, the absence of proof that Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva had title to the land which is the subject matter of this case and the absence of the probate, it is not possible to assume that, land which is the subject matter of this case devolved to G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d of Don Adiriyan De Silva unless there is other evidence to show that it was so. In the light of these possibilities, if the 1st defendant wished to succeed in her claim, she was obliged to lead other evidence to establish that, Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva was the owner of the land and that, the land was thereafter, transferred to his heirs, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva, in the aforesaid shares in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. If the 1st defendant could not produce the probate, she could have produced the Executors Conveyance (or a certified copy of it), which, in the usual course of events, is likely to have been executed in favour of G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva if the land had come to them in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. The 1st defendant could have produced the records at the Land Registry which could have established that, Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva was the owner of the land and that, the land was thereafter, transferred to his heirs, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva. The 1st defendant has done none of that. In these circumstances, it is evident that, the learned High Court Judges correctly held that, that the 1st defendant had failed to prove that Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva was the owner of the land and that the land was thereafter, transferred to his",

    "text": "heirs, G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva, in the aforesaid shares in the manner set out in the Last Will marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. What remains to be considered in terms of the aforesaid question of law is whether the deeds produced by the 1st defendant marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d to \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d, prove her claim to be entitled to a 29/48th share of the land. At this point, it is significant to note that, the evidence established that the plaintiff has been in possession of the major part of the land for a long period of time without any dispute from any of the defendants. It was also established in evidence that the 1st defendant did not have possession of the land. In this connection, the learned District Judge held that the Surveyor\u2019s Report established that the plaintiff was in possession and that, the 1st and 3rd defendants had admitted the plaintiff had been in possession of the land. The learned District Judge also held that, the 1st defendant had not been in possession of the land. Thus, it appears from the evidence led at this trial that, the 1st defendant has not made any claims to the land until this action was instituted, despite the plaintiff being in possession for many years. To get back to considering whether the 1st defendant had proved her claim to a 29/48th share of the land, it is seen that, the 1st defendant claims a 1/12th share upon the deeds marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d and \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d is deed no. 487 dated 17th July 1961 by which Walgama Wellalage Asilin Nona, Walgama Wellalage Ariyaratne, Walgama Wellalage Karunadasa and Walagama Wellalage Piyaseeli have transferred a 1/12th share in the land to S.Karonchihamy. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d is deed no. 129 dated 02nd June 1971 by which S.Karonchihamy transferred that 1/12th share [together with two 1/16th shares] to the 1st defendant. Although the 1st defendant has stated that, the four transferors named in the deed no. 487 marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d were the heirs of Francinahamy and that she was one of the children and heirs of the aforesaid G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera who held a 1/2 share of the land following the death of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d does not refer to any of those facts claimed by the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant has failed to produce any other evidence to support her claims. It is also to be noted that, although in paragraph [8] of her Statement of Claim, the 1st defendant has stated that, Francinahamy also had a daughter named Pemawathie, that daughter is not named as a transferor in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d. It is also to be noted that, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d has been executed over sixty years after the death of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva and there is no evidence with regard to when G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera died and the manner in which his estate was administered. On the other hand, the plaintiff has produced deeds which establish the aforesaid three chains of title claimed by him which stretch back to the 1920s and 1940s and the plaintiff has been in possession of the land for many years. In these circumstances and in the absence of evidence that the aforesaid transferors",

Accordingly, it cannot be said that, the deeds marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d and \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d prove that the 1st defendant is entitled to a 1/12th share of the land. Next, the 1st defendant claims a 87/864 share upon the deed no. 10193 dated 30th June 1969 marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d by which Mabel Alwis Wijesiri Gunawardena, Oliver Alwis Wijesiri Gunawardena and Adilin Waidyaratne transferred a 87/864th share in the land to the 1st defendant. Although the 1st defendant has stated that, the first and second transferors named in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d were the two children and heirs of Punchi Nona who was one of the heirs of the aforesaid G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera who is said to have held a1/4 share of the land following the death of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva and the third transferor named in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d was the only child and heir of Peter who was also one of the heirs of the aforesaid G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d makes no statements to that effect other than mentioning that the land had come to the first and second transferors by maternal inheritance and to the third transferor by paternal inheritance. The 1st defendant has failed to produce any other evidence. Further, the birth certificate marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd26\u201d states that, Oliver Alwis Wijesiri Gunawardena was the son of one Lucy Waidyaratne Jayasundera and not Punchi Nona De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera as claimed by the 1st defendant. The other facts mentioned in the preceding paragraph with regard to the absence of evidence as to when G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera died and the manner in which his estate was administered and with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s chain of title and the plaintiff being in possession of the land, are equally relevant mutatis mutandis in this case too. In these circumstances and in the absence of evidence that the aforesaid transferors who are said to be grandchildren of G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera and G.V. Don Bastian De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera obtained and continued to have title to the land in 1969, the mere production of the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d cannot lead to an assumption that the transferors named in that deed had title to the land in 1969 when this deed was executed. Accordingly, it cannot be said that, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d proves that the 1st defendant is entitled to a 87/864th share of the land. Thereafter, the 1st defendant claims a 1/16th share upon the deeds marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d and \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d is deed no. 330 dated 21st April 1962 marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d by which Wilfred Wijeratne, Grace Senaratne nee Wijeratne, Jeslin Alwis nee Wijeratne and Neville Wijeratne transferred a 1/16th share in the land to S.Karonchihamy. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d is the aforesaid deed no. 129 by which S. Karonchihamy transferred that 1/16th share to the 1st defendant [along with the aforesaid 1/12th share and another 1/16th share].

The 1st defendant has failed to produce any other evidence. It is also to be noted that, although in paragraph [14] of her Statement of Claim, the 1st defendant has stated that, Jane Nona also had two other children named George and Lilian, they are not named as transferors in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d. The other facts mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are relevant in this case too. In these circumstances and in the absence of evidence that the aforesaid transferors who are said to be grandchildren of G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera continued to have title to the land in 1962, the mere production of the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d cannot lead to an assumption that the transferors named in that deed had title to the land in 1962 when this deed was executed. Accordingly, it cannot be said that, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d proves that the 1st defendant is entitled to a 1/16th share of the land. Next, the 1st defendant claims another 1/16th share upon the deeds marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d and \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d is deed no. 2210 dated 07th September 1965 by which Bertram Carl De Silva Waidyaratne transferred a 1/16th share in the land to S.Karonchihamy. \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d is the aforesaid deed no. 129 by which S. Karonchihamy transferred that 1/16th share to the 1st defendant [along with the aforesaid 1/12th share and 1/16th share]. Although the 1st defendant has stated that, the transferor named in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d was one of the children and heirs of the aforesaid G.V. Don Charlis De Silva Waidyaratne Jayasundera who is said to have held a 1/4 share of the land following the death of Lokuge Don Adiriyan De Silva, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d makes no statement to that effect other than a mention that the land had come to the transferor by paternal inheritance. The 1st defendant has failed to produce any other evidence. Here too, the other facts mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are relevant. In these circumstances, the mere production of the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d cannot lead to an assumption that the transferor named in that deed had title to the land in 1965 when this deed was executed. Accordingly, it cannot be said that, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d proves that the 1st defendant is entitled to a 1/16th share of the land. Finally, the 1st defendant claims a 1/14th share upon the deed no. 3137 dated 07th July 1991 marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d by which Lokuge Darlin Waidyaratne transferred a 1/4th share in the land to the 1st defendant during the pendency of this action. Although the 1st defendant has stated that, the transferor named in the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d was the only child and sole heir of the aforesaid Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d makes no statement to that effect other than stating that the several properties which are the subject matter of that deed had come to the transferor by paternal inheritance.

The situation is further complicated by the deed no. 3434 dated 01st March 1949 produced by the plaintiff marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd016\u201d. By this deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd016\u201d, Lokuge Don Hendrick De Silva has transferred his rights in the land to S.Jai Appu from whom the land has subsequently come to the plaintiff in the manner set out in the plaintiff\u2019s chain of title. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that, the deed marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d proves that the 1st defendant is entitled to a 1/4th share of the land.
