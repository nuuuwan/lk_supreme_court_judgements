UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal

of the Central Province holden at Kandy dated 19.12.2008. By the said judgment

5

the Civil Appellate High Court has dismissed the appeal of the Defendant

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) subject to the

variations of the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kandy dated 24.06.2003

which was delivered in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court has held the view

that the relief prayed for in prayer 2 to the plaint should be restricted to rooms

bearing Nos. 130C, 130D and 130E, other than the rooms bearing Nos. 130A and

130B of the building in question.

Leave to Appeal has been granted on the following questions of law

set out in paragraph 20 (a) and (b) of the petition of appeal dated 29th January

2009;

20(a) Is the Defendant Petitioner in possession of boutiques 130C, 130D

and 130E?

(b) Did the original Plaintiff terminate the said leave and license granted

to the Defendant Petitioner in respect of the boutiques 130C, 130D

and 130E?

The Plaintiff instituted the instant action against the Appellant in the

District Court of Kandy seeking a declaration to the land described in the schedule

to the plaint. The Appellant took up the position that he constructed the said

building in question with his money and he was in possession of five rooms

bearing Nos. 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, and 130E. He further averred that the

plaintiff has failed to terminate the alleged leave and license given to him.

The Appellant has not disputed the title of the plaintiff to the land in

suit. It is apparent from the facts of the case that the plaintiff and the appellant are

mother and son. The Appellant went on to say that he spent over Rs. 2.2 Million

for the construction of the said building and out of the said five rooms two were

6

boutiques and three were store rooms. He has further stated that he spent on the

administration of the said building, paid the rates and taxes, electricity bills and

water bills.

The Appellant has given evidence. With regard to the claim of the

Appellant the burden is on him to prove that he was in lawful possession as the

plaintiff’s title to the land in suit has not been disputed by the Appellant. In this

regard, the Appellant has stated that shortly prior to the filing of present action in

June, 1999, whilst the Appellant had gone to the Munneswaram temple, the

plaintiff and two of her daughters who have instigated the plaintiff to file this

action have on or about 17.02.1999 trespassed in to the rooms bearing Nos. 130A,

130B, 130C, 130D and 130E of the downstairs portion of the said premises in suit

which were wholly occupied and possessed by the Appellant. The Appellant

further averred that the Primary Court of Kandy in case No 46488 had made order

that the Appellant be restored to possession.

The Appellant has set out a question of law with regard to the

termination of leave and license, at the trial. But the Appellant has failed to raise an

issue on the matter of termination of leave and license. He has raised issues No 06

to 15 on the basis that he constructed the building in issue and he was in

occupation of the said three rooms in downstairs.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that the case has been

heard and concluded on the issues raised by the parties and therefore the Appellant,

for the first time in appeal, cannot raised the matter of terminating the leave and

license given to the Appellant by the plaintiff since it was a matter arising out of

the facts of the case.

7

It is well settled law that once issues are framed and a trial is held and

concluded on those issues, the court should decide the case on the issues already

framed and thereby the pleadings recede to background.

In the case of Setha vs. Weerakoon 49 NLR 225 Howard C.J. stated

that “A new point which was not raised in the issues or in the course of the trial

cannot be raised for the first time in appeal, unless such point might have been

raised at the trial under one of the issues framed, and the Court of Appeal has

before it all the requisite material for deciding the point, or the question is one of

law and nothing more.”

In the case of Candappa nee Bastian Vs. Ponambalampillai (1993) 1

SLR 184 Supreme Court held that “A party cannot be permitted to present in

appeal a case different from that presented in the trial court where matters of fact

are involved which were not in issue at the trial such case not being one which

raises a pure question of law.”

The Appellant is burdened to prove his possession as regard the

possession of the said rooms bearing Nos. 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D and 130E as

the title of the plaintiff to the premises in question is not in dispute. The Appellant

has given evidence at the trial to prove his possession. But there had been no any

other witness called to testify the possession of the premises in question of the

Appellant. An official witness has been called merely to produce the case record of

the Primary Court. The Appellant has closed his case leading in evidence the

documents marked V 1 to V 15. Said documents do not in any way establish the

possession of the Appellant. The Appellant has not adduced any evidence in order

to support his evidence. The documents produced by the plaintiff marked P 1 to P

59 clearly establish that she was in occupation of the premises in suit paying rates

8

and taxes. When I consider the said evidence I cannot find any reason to interfere

with the findings of the learned District Judge.

In the case of Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119 G. P. S.

de Silva, C.J. held that “It is well established that findings of primary facts by a

trial Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal.”

In the said circumstances I see no reason to interfere with the said

judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 19.12.2008. The said questions

of law cannot be answered in favour of the Appellant. Hence, I dismiss the appeal

of the Appellant with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
