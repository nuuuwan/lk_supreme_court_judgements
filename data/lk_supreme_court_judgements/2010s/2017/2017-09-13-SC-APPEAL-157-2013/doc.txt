Before : Buwaneka Aluwihare PC J Sisira J De Abrew J Anil Gooneratne J Counsel : Sunil Abeyratne with Thushara Gunatilake for the 7th to 9th Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellants Chandrika Morawake for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Argued on : 3.3.2017 Written Submission Tendered on : 1.11.2013 by the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellants 20.12.2013 by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Decided on : 13.09. 2017 Sisira J De Abrew J. The 7th ,8th , 9th Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the Defendant-Appellants) in this case filed an appeal in the Civil

Appellate High Court challenging the judgment of learned District Judge dated

20.8.2017. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court) by their judgment dated 15.3.2012 dismissed the

petition of appeal on the ground that it had not been presented to the District

Court within 60 days from the date of the judgment which is the stipulated time

period prescribed to present a petition of appeal in Section 755(3) of the Civil

Procedure Code (the CPC). Section 755(3) of the CPC reads as follows.

“Every appellant shall within sixty days from the date of the judgment or

decree appealed against present to the original Court a petition of appeal

setting out the circumstances out of which the appeal arises and the

grounds of objection to the judgment or decree appealed against, and

containing the particulars required by section 758, which shall be signed

3

by the appellant or his registered Attorney. Such petition of appeal shall

be exempt from stamp duty:

Provided that, if such petition is not presented to the original Court

within sixty days from the date of the judgment or the decree appealed

against, the court shall refuse to receive the appeal.”

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court, the

Defendant-Appellants have filed this appeal. This Court by its order dated

20.9.2013 granted leave to appeal on the questions of law which are set out

below.

1. Did the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court err in

concluding that the petition of appeal filed in that court had been filed out

time?

2. Was there a valid notice of appeal and petition of appeal filed on behalf

of the Appellants in the Civil Appellate High Court?

It is undisputed in this case that the petition of appeal should have been

presented to the District Court on or before 19.10.2007. Learned counsel for the

Defendant-Appellants contended that the petition of appeal had been presented

to the District Court on 19.10.2007. But learned counsel for the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Respondents) contended that the petition of appeal had not been presented to the

District Court on 19.10.2007. Therefore the most important question that must

be decided in this case is whether the petition of appeal had been tendered to the

District Court on 19.10.2007 or not. I now advert to this question. When the

petition of appeal tendered to the District Court is examined, it appears that the

said petition of appeal bears the date stamp of the Record Room of the District

Court. According to the date stamp, the date is 19.10.2007. Learned counsel for

the Defendant-Appellants relying on the said date stamp contended that the

petition of appeal had been tendered to the District Court on 19.10.2007.

4

Although learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellants contended so, the

Registrar of the Record Room of the District Court had made a minute

addressed to the Chief Registrar of the District Court to the following effect.

“Chief Registrar. 23.10.2017.

This Petition of appeal had been put to the motion box of the Record

Room by mistake. Submitted for necessary action.

Registrar in Charge of the Record Room.”

The above minute clearly shows that the Petition of Appeal had not been

handed over to the Registrar of the District Court or to the Registrar in Charge

of the Record Room on 19.10.2007 although it bears the date stamp of the

Record Room of the District Court indicting the date as 19.10.2007.

When a Petition of Appeal or a Notice of Appeal is handed over to the

District Court, the accepted practice is to hand over the same to the Registrar of

the District Court who shall state the date and time of presentation of the

document and initial it. The other practice is when a Petition of Appeal or a

Notice of Appeal is tendered to the Registrar of the District Court, he will place

the date stamp of the District Court; state the time of presentation; and initial on

the date stamp. The fact that there is a practice of this nature is evident when

one examines the Notice of Appeal tendered to the District Court which bears

the date and time of handing over of the document and the signature of the

Registrar of the District Court. The fact that there is a practice of this nature is

also established by the judgment of Justice SN Silva (as he then was) in the case

of Nachchiduwa Vs Mansoor[1995] 2SLR 273 at page275 which reads as

follows.

“We have carefully considered the submission of learned counsel. We note that

in terms of Section 755(3) the appellant has to present to the original court a

petition of appeal within a period of 60 days of the judgment. The act of the

registered attorney of the defendants-appellants in tendering the petition of

appeal to the Registrar and the act of the Registrar in placing the date stamp

5

and his initials on the petition of appeal constitute a presentation of the petition

of appeal.”

The petition of appeal submitted to the District Court does not bear a minute by

the Registrar of the District Court stating the date and time of handing over the

said document. It does not have any minute made by the Registrar of the

District Court on 19.10.2007. It has a minute made on 23.10.2007 by the

Registrar in charge of the Record Room which I have referred to above. There

is another matter that should be considered in finding an answer to the question

whether the petition of appeal had been tendered to the District Court on

19.10.2007 or not. The entries of the Motion Book of the District Court relating

to 19.10.2007 had been produced marked „A‟in the High Court. The learned

Judges of the High Court have considered this Motion Book. The last entry in

page 318 of the Motion Book is entry No.46. Therefore the next entry in page

319 of the Motion Book should be entry No.47. The entry No.47 had been

correctly entered in page 319 on the first line and this entry should be the first

entry in page 319 of the Motion Book. But when page 319 of the Motion Book

is examined it can be clearly seen that above the said entry No.47 there is

another entry and the number of the said entry is also 46. Therefore it is seen in

this Motion Book there are two entries under No.46. The second entry No.46

relates to the Petition of Appeal in this case and this entry had been made on the

line where printed letters of the book are printed. This line is not meant for

making entries.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the Petition of Appeal

had not been handed over to the District Court on or before 19.10.2007. In view

of the above conclusion reached by me, I answer the 1st question of law in the

negative.

For the above reasons, I hold that that the Petition of Appeal had not been

presented to the District Court within 60 days from the date of the judgment of

6

the District Court. In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the 2nd

question of law as follows.

“There was no valid petition of appeal filed on behalf of the Appellants in the

Civil Appellate High Court.”

For the above reasons, I hold that the learned Judges of the High Court

were correct when they dismissed the appeal of Defendant-Appellants. For the

above reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
