Weliamuna P.C. with Pulasthi Hewanna and Thishya Weragoda Instructed by Vishva de Livera Tennakoon for the Petitioner Parinda Ranasinghe S.D.S.G. with Lakmali Karunanayake, S.S.C. for the Respondents WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TENDERED ON: 17.07.2015 (BY THE PETITIONER) 17.07.2015 (BY THE RESPONDENTS) ARGUED ON: 26.10.2017 DECIDED ON: 15.11.2017 GOONERATNE J. The Petitioner in this application is a British citizen and a Nurse at

the Hawkesbury Lodge, Rehabilitation, Mental Health Services, United Kingdom.

The petition and affidavit of the Petitioner describes her as a devout practicing

3

Buddhist and attends meditations retreats in countries like Nepal, Thailand,

Cambodia and India. In the petition filed of record it is stated that “as an apt

tribute to and as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teachings

displays a tattoo on her upper right arm of Lord Buddha seated on a lotus flower

of Buddhist path”. It is stated that this was done as a mark of respect, but

ultimately led to unfortunate incidents in Sri Lanka on her arrival to the island

on 21.04.2014. It is pleaded that subsequently the Petitioner was arbitrarily

arrested, detained and she complains of degrading treatment, culminating in

her arbitrary, irrational, capricious and ultra vires deportation.

Supreme Court on 03.07.2014 granted Leave to Proceed on alleged

violations of Articles, 11, 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution. On the day in

question as pleaded Petitioner arrived in Sri Lanka at the Katunayake airport. All

official steps as clearance from Customs AND Immigrations were attended and

was permitted entry. She proceeded towards the exit of the airport. Petitioner

was approached by a taxi driver called ‘Kelum’ who was later identified and

another bystander informed her that the tattoo she was displaying on her right

arm is objectionable in Sri Lanka. Thereafter another person claiming to be a

member of the Civil Defence Force came to the scene and initially informed the

Petitioner that the tattoo was unacceptable, and also informed her that she

should proceed to the nearest police station. It is pleaded that all efforts to

4

reason out with the civil defence officer was of no avail and as there was no

option, proceeded to the Katunayake police station with the taxi driver, Kelum

and the civil defence officer. It is pleaded that there were other several

uniformed officers outside the airport who took no notice nor offence of

Petitioner’s tattoo.

The Petition filed in this court refer to some of the following sub

headings. It is relevant to consider same to ascertain the depth and extent to

which the Petitioner was treated or harassed by the Respondents and all those

involved in this unfortunate incident.

(A) Incidents at the Katunayake police station

(B) Events that took place in the Negombo Magistrate’s Court.

(C) Detention at the Negombo prison.

(D) Detention at the Mirihana Immigration detention camp

(E) Unlawful deportation of the Petitioner.

(A) Taxi driver accompanied the Petitioner and was the translator who

translated the instructions of the police. Whilst waiting in the police an

officer took photographs of Petitioner. 3rd Respondent questioned the

Petitioner in poor English as to why she had a tattoo. Petitioner explained

but the 3rd Respondent could not understand, according to the Petitioner.

3rd Respondent confiscated the passport of the Petitioner and refused to

answer any questions or inform the charges levelled against the

5

Petitioner. No statements recorded but Petitioner was told to make a

written statement which she did and explained her position. Petitioner

was informed by the police that she would be produced before the

Magistrate but the police did not inform what the charges are to her.

Petitioner was not given an opportunity to contact the British High

Commission in Sri Lanka. A friend of Petitioner called ‘Jennifer Hadley’,

was to arrive in Sri Lanka and she had no alternative but to inform the taxi

driver ‘Kelun’ to give details of Petitioner to her friend ‘Jenny’ who would

arrive at the airport.

(B) Petitioner was taken to the Magistrate’s Court and detained behind bars

with several other female suspects. Prison Guards introduced the

Petitioner to an Attorney-at-Law who appeared for a fee of Rs. 5000/- for

his services. However Petitioner had no opportunity to give proper

instructions to the Attorney or consultant and obtain legal advice. Whilst

being behind bars in the court cell, prison guard in charge of the Petitioner

made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks of a sexually explicit

nature to the Petitioner (paragraph 6(b) of petition). The Petitioner’s case

was called in open court. In (Case No. B 354/14) Proceedings were held in

Sinhala and Petitioner was unable to understand. It is pleaded (paragraph

6 (e) that neither the Judge, officials of the court, and Attorney-at-Law

6

made submissions or orders in the English Language at least for the

Petitioner to understand.

At the conclusion of the hearing before the Magistrate, the

Attorney-at-Law who represented the Petitioner informed her that the

Petitioner would be deported. Passport returned to her. ‘B’ report 354/14

does not give details of the provisions of law she was arrested, charged

convicted or detained (paragraph 6 h).

(C) At about 3.00 p.m. on 21.04.2014 Petitioner was escorted by a woman

prison officer and the prison guard who harassed her whilst in the

Magistrate’s Court cell. She was taken to the Negombo Prison, where she

was subject to harassment and degrading treatment as follows

(Paragraph 8 of the petition).

(i) Woman Police Constable (WPC) searched petitioner’s

belonging and demanded Rs. 10,000/- from the amount of

Rs. 13,000/- of Petitioner. WPC attempted to take

Petitioner’s mobile phone. Ultimately WPC took Rs. 2000/- of

Petitioner’s money. The prison guard who was in charge of

the Petitioner continued to make obscene lewd remarks. He

too demanded money. Petitioner’s belongings handed over

to another officer.

(ii) Petitioner subject to a body search and kept in the area

where about 60 inmates were housed and one of the inmates

provided a mat to the Petitioner to sleep. On 22.04.2014,

7

Petitioner informed that she would be taken to a detention

centre, namely ‘Mirihana Immigration Detention Camp’.

(D) Petitioner taken to immigration office on 22.04.2014 prior to taking her

to the Detention Camp. Petitioner’s passport was confiscated by the

officer at the Immigration office. Several camera crews took Petitioner’s

photograph. Petitioner was permitted to speak with the British High

Commission in Colombo. Petitioner taken to Detention Camp and

detained at the camp for two nights. Petitioner’s friend Jennifer Hadley

visited her at the camp. Officials of the Department of Immigration

questioned the Petitioner as to how she was treated during detention.

Petitioner narrated the entire incident. On 24.04.2014 Petitioner was

informed by the British High Commission that the Sri Lanka Tourist Board

would fund her return to the United Kingdom and provide her with a

Business Class Ticket.

(E) Petitioner was escorted to the airport by officers of the Department of

Immigration and Emigration. Petitioner met her friend at the airport and

checked into the Business Class by flight UL 503. Petitioner ‘s passport

kept with the cabin crew and returned to her on arrival in U.K.

8

Petitioner is advised that deportation of foreigners from Sri Lanka

are governed by Immigration & Emigrations Act No 20 of 1948. Power of

deportation is with the Minister in charge of the subject.

Petitioner is advised to state that the unlawful detention was based

on an order by the Magistrate who did not have jurisdiction to make such

order.

I have also perused the affidavit of the Petitioner’s friend Jennifer

Headly, who met the Petitioner subsequent to her arrest, and both were on tour

as planned earlier. This affidavit of Jennifer sets out the details and the events

described by the Petitioner to an extent. The affidavit somewhat support the

version of the Petitioner but the Respondents have failed to contradict Jennifer

Headlys’ affidavit. I note the following salient matters in her affidavit.

(i) Received a text message on her mobile phone from the Petitioner just

as she landed at Katunayake airport on 21.04.2014. Message state

Petitioner is in the police station, and was to be taken to court, as she

had a tattoo of Lord Buddha. She had the tattoo when she came to Sri

Lanka earlier. Taxi driver ‘Kelum will pick her up and bring her to the

court house.

(ii) Went to the court house in ‘Kelum’s taxi. She saw Petitioner in the cell

looking very pale and worried. Petitioner was crying. Lawyer

approached her and said Petitioner would be deported. She saw the

Petitioner was quite shaken.

9

(iii) Lawyer told her that Petitioner would have to go back to U.K. As such

Petitioner would be in detention. Lawyer also told her to find a hotel

nearby so that she could spend the day.

(iv) When coming out of the court house a female officer surround by male

guards demanded for money, saying “you English woman give me

money” She got into a taxi and the driver told her that the guard should

be given some money. She gave Rs. 500/-. Then another guard came

to ask for money, and at which point she broke down and started to

shout. The guard walked away. She took charge of Petitioner luggage,

went to a nearby shop to get some water and food for the Petitioner.

Petitioner was seated in the court house. She gave the Petitioner food

and water. She lent over to hug the Petitioner and the guard behind

her threateningly put his hand on his pistol as a warning not to get

closer to the Petitioner.

(v) Taxi driver took her to a hotel near the court house and the taxi driver

demanded Rs. 20,000/- although Petitioner paid Rs. 5000/-, ultimately

she paid 17,000/-.

(vi) She stayed at the Golden Star Beach Hotel. ‘She called the British High

Commission and found that they knew nothing about a British woman

being arrested. On 22.04.2014 in the company of a foreign lady she

went to the prison. A bus came by and the Petitioner was in the bus.

Petitioner shouted out for her and at that moment itself a prison guard

gave details of Mirihana Detention Centre.

In the afternoon of 22nd April she got to the detention centre.

The 2nd Respondent to this application deny the allegation of the

Petitioner referred to in her affidavit and state that the Petitioner had a tattoo

10

of Lord Buddha on a lotus flower and below it a male and female embracing,

which was also observed by P.C. Jayatilleke. It is averred that many civilians

present in the vicinity too became aware. The people gathered at the scene

were disturbed or otherwise agitated. 2nd Respondent states he perceived an

imminent disturbance of peace by the public. Statement of three witnesses are

annexed to the affidavit marked and produced as 2R1, 2R2 & 2R3. 2nd

Respondent states in view of above there was a need to take the Petitioner to a

safer place, and he requested the Petitioner to proceed to the police station.

Petitioner proceeded to the police in a taxi. At the police the Petitioner was in

the custody of a female officer. 2nd Respondent aver on instructions of 3rd

Respondent produced the Petitioner to the Magistrate’s Court of Negombo. 2nd

Respondent’s notes are annexed marked R4. The 2nd Respondent states:

(a) Facts were correctly reported to the Magistrate.

(b) No charges were framed and the question of pleading guilty did not arise.

(c) Hon. Attorney General’s sanction will be required only if charges were

being framed.

2nd Respondent affirm that he did not act maliciously. I wish to observe

that 2R1, 2R2 and 2R3 are belated statements. It is nothing but self-serving

statements produced to support the version of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. The

statements highlight the fact that due to the tattoo displayed by the Petitioner

there were people in the crowd becoming either restless or agitated, having

11

seen the tattoo. Further it could result in a breach of peace. The incident took

place on 21.04.2014 but statements recorded from three persons working

within the airport on 15.05.2014, 26.05.2014 and 24.05.2014 respectfully.

3rd Respondent was the Acting Officer-In-Charge of the Katunayake

police station, whilst denying the allegations levelled against him by the

Petitioner, states he received a telephone complaint by a civilian, regarding a

tattoo by a foreign lady. The Petitioner arrived in the police station in a taxi

driven by driver Kelum, 2nd Respondent and P.C. Jayatilleke. He states he learnt

from the 2nd Respondent due to the prevailing situation, requested the

Petitioner to come to the police station. 3rd Respondent states having

considered all circumstances he thought it fit to produce the Petitioner before

the Magistrate for a suitable order. The Magistrate referred the Petitioner to the

Mirihana Deportation Centre. 3rd Respondent states he kept the British High

Commission, Senior Police Officials informed by letter 3R2, 3R3 & 3R4.

This court having considered submissions by either party states that

it cannot be said that the Petitioner was not arrested. The fact that the

Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate on a ‘B’ Report (P2) is sufficient

proof of Petitioner being arrested. The ‘B’ Report states there was no offence

allegedly committed by the Petitioner. It also reveal that police acted on

information received from airport authorities and police had been convinced

12

that Petitioner had no intention of outrages religious feelings. By this report to

court police seek an order for deportation of the Petitioner. It is further stated

police do not seek to carry out further investigations. This court observes that

there was no legal basis or a right to arrest the Petitioner at all. The police could

arrest only on reasonable grounds of suspicion. This is nothing but an erroneous

assumption of authority by the police. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents arrested the

Petitioner and produced the Petitioner before the learned Magistrate of

Negombo without a proper basis with a view of deporting the Petitioner. Arrest

without a warrant can only be made in terms of Section 32 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. To permit extra judicial arrest would be detrimental to

the liberty of the Petitioner. We in this court cannot encourage illegality merely

to help the police.

If the Respondents acted in good faith but upon a misapprehension

of the law, the courts have held that it was irrelevant in deciding whether Article

13(1) had been violated. Premaratne and Somawathie Vs. Somapala S.C.

Application 68/86; S.C Minutes 11.05.1988. If one had a wrong appreciation of

the law, court held that the infringement however remained. Goonawardena

Vs. Perera 1983 Vol 2 FRD 426 at 436. In this case it was further held that

“However anxious police officers may be to avoid the evils of laws delay and

commendably assist the administration of justice, they must comply with

13

salutary provisions established by law designed to protect the liberty of the

subject... “This also need to be done in terms of Article 4d of the Constitution

which requires court to “respect, secure an advance” fundamental rights.

In Corea Vs. The Queen 55 NLR at 464

“police officer must also realise that before they arrest without a warrant, “they must be

persuaded of the guilt of the accused”. They cannot bolster up their assurance or the strength

of the case by seeking further evidence and detaining the man meanwhile, or taking him to

some spot where they can or may find further evidence” per Lord Porter in John Lewis & Co.

Ltd . V. Times 1 ((1952) A.C. 676 at 691).”

In the ‘B’ Report itself it is stated that the Petitioner had no

intention to outrage such feelings. A charge relating to Section 291 B of the Penal

Code cannot be maintained i.e “outraging the religious feelings of any class by

insulting its religion or religious beliefs”. There is no acceptable evidence placed

before this court that there was a possibility of public outcry, though the police

attempt to say so in their statements recorded. I agree with the Petitioner’s

learned President’s Counsel that “surmises will not suffice”. As stated above

bona fides or mala fides of the arresting officer is irrelevant in deciding whether

Article 13(1) has been violated.

I accept the version of the Petitioner. On the other hand I accept

the submissions of the Respondent that public officers were adhering to a

judicial order. Further judicial orders cannot be challenged in Fundamental

14

Rights Application. But whatever that took place prior to such judicial order,

(which was an illegal order) the Petitioner having been harassed or subject

degrading treatment by some officers either police or a civil defence officer and

prison guards is relevant in the context of the case. Money was extracted from

the Petitioner and unacceptable language used on the Petitioner even prior to

taking up the case before the Magistrate by some guards are horrifying and

scandalous in the circumstances and in the context of the case in hand. How

money was extracted is supported by the affidavit of Jennifer Hedley.

I also wish to observe that the police, in the case in hand

misrepresented facts and misled the learned Magistrate into believing that a

Deportation Order could be made by such court. I accept the submissions that

the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to make an order of deportation. The

deportation of foreigners is governed by the Immigration & Emigration Act No.

20 of 1948 as Amended. The power to order removal and or deportation from

Sri Lanka of a person other than a citizen of Sri Lanka is vested in the Minister in

charge of same. As such the 3rd Respondent has acted in misapprehension of the

law in seeking an order from court. Vide Gunawardena Vs. Perera (1983) 1 SLR

305; Channa Peiris and Others Vs. A.G 1994(1) SLR at Pg. 51.

In all the facts and circumstances of this case I hold that Petitioner’s

rights have been violated, and it is established that Article 11, 12(1) and 13(1) of

15

the Constitution has been violated. More particularly the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents have violated Articles 12(1) & 13(1). Registrar of this court is

directed to forward a copy of this Judgment to the Judicial Service Commission.

The Inspector General of Police and Controller of Immigration & Emigration. The

provisions of the Immigration & Emigrations Act need to be strictly followed, in

a case of this nature.

I direct the State to pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 500000/- (Five

Hundred Thousand) as compensation and costs in a sum of Rs. 200000/- (Two

Hundred Thousand). I also direct the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to pay Rs. 50,000/-

each as compensation to the Petitioner.

Application allowed with costs.
