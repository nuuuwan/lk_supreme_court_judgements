CJ Plaintiff- Respondent-Appellant hereinafter referred to as the \u201cPlaintiff\u201d instituted action in the District Court of Colombo in Case No. 20421/L against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Defendant\u2019 seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint and to evict the Defendant and others who are in possession of the land. The learned District Judge answered the Plaintiffs\u2019 issues in the affirmative and gave judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the judgement of the learned District Judge, the Defendant filed an appeal to the High Court (Civil Appeal) of the Western Province holden in Colombo in Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/294/2009(F). The learned High Court Judges after hearing allowed the appeal of the Defendant holding that the plaintiff failed to establish the title to the land . Being aggrieved by the judgement of the High Court, the Plaintiff filed a Leave to Appeal Application in the Supreme Court and obtained leave on the question of law set out in paragraph 13(c) (1) of the Petition which reads as follows: (c) that the High Court had failed to consider- (1) the admissions, the gazette, the statutory determination, the evidence of the notary and the administrator\u2019s conveyance and thereby erred in law. This case was argued before us and after the conclusion of the argument the parties were permitted to file written submissions. Thereafter the parties have filed comprehensive written submissions. The main reason for the learned High Court Judges to set aside judgement of the District Judge was that the Plaintiffs had failed to establish the title to the land. It is the position of the Plaintiffs\u2019 that their predecessors in title are the owners of a larger land which is referred to in the 1st schedule and that the Defendants have wrongfully entered in to the portion of the land and in occupation of the land which is described in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint.",

    "text": "In this appeal the main question of law is whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 had established the title to the land which is an essential requisite in a rei vindication action. In the trial parties admitted the jurisdiction of the court and the identity of the land. The Plaintiff raised issues numbers 1-6 and the Defendant raised issues numbers7-14. Thereafter Plaintiff raised consequential issues numbered 15-17. The Plaintiffs have pleaded that Kuruwitage Don Nicholas Appuhamy is the owner of the land described in Schedule 1 to the Plaint. The said Nicholas Appuhamy by his Last Will bequeathed the said property to his wife Don Senthanona Abeysinghe. The Last Will was proved in the testamentary case bearing No. DC Colombo 17127/T . Thus Don Senthanona Abeysinghe became the owner of the property described in the schedule to the Plaint. The said property was vested with the Land Reform Commission with the coming into operation of Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972. Thereafter, by Gazette Extraordinary dated 10.11.1992 a statutory determination was made in favour of Senthanona Abeysinghe and thereby she became the owner of the land described in the 1st schedule. The said Dona Senthnona by Last Will No. 3032 dated 27.04.1982 attested by Herman Perera, Notary Public bequeathed the said land to her grandsons who are the Plaintiffs in this case. The Executor of the estate by executor conveyance No. 913 attested by G.Shelton Perera Notary Public conveyed the land to the Plaintiffs. It is the position of the Plaintiffs that the Defendants are cultivators of the land adjacent to the land described in the plaint. They have encroached upon a portion of the land in the first schedule and tried to construct a house in the said land . Then the Plaintiffs made a complaint to Mulleriyawa Police on 23.03.2004. The Plaintiffs filed this action seeking a declaration to the land in question and to evict the defendant from the land. Plaintiff sought an interim / permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from constructing a building in the said land. The Defendants in the answer denied the title of the Plaintiffs. It is the position of the Defendants that the 1st Defendant who is the father of the 2nd Defendant cultivated the land from 1965 and was in possession of that land for a long period of time. The defendants annexed a schedule to the answer and claimed that they were in possession of the land described in the schedule to the answer for a long period of time. Both parties admitted the identity of the corpus. However, defendant challenged the title of the Plaintiff and moved to dismiss the Plaint. When considering the description of the land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint and the schedule annexed to the answer it refers to two different lands. The land claimed by the Plaintiffs\u2019is known as Naimaladuwa whereas the land claimed by the defendants is known as Kiralduwa. The land claimed by defendants on the basis that they had prescribed to the land refers to a different land. Plaintiffs admitted that the defendants were cultivating in an adjoining land. The",

The Defendants submits that as the Plaintiffs\u2019 title commenced from Nicholas Appuhamy it is necessary to prove as to how Nicholas Appuhamy acquired title to the land The Defendants took up the position that the documents marked P 1-P7 were produced subject to proof and it was not proved. The trial Judge in his judgment considered this matter and held that the documents were properly proved. The document marked P1 is a gazette and the Court could take judicial notice of the gazette. P2 is a duly certified copy of the plan prepared by the Surveyor General and which is referred to in the gazette. The document marked P3 which is the last will was produced by Herman Perera, Notary Public who attested the Last Will. He gave evidence to the effect that the Last Will was attested by him. The Executor of the Last Will Sunil Siriwardana gave evidence to the effect that the Probate was granted to him and as executor he conveyed the property by executor conveyance No. 913 dated 09.02.1995 attested by Gerald Shelton Perera Notary Public which is marked as P4. The said Notary Public was not called as he is dead. Two attesting witnesses namely Ariyaratne and Jinadasa gave evidence to the effect that they attested the deed. P5 is a letter send by 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs which was not challenged. The learned District Judge correctly held that the plaintiffs proved the documents which were produced as evidence. The learned Trial Judge was satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved the title to the land. It was further established that the land claimed by the Defendants is a different land. The only question is whether Defendants encroached upon the portion of the land referred to the 2nd schedule and prescribe to the land. The learned District Judge answered the Plaintiffs\u2019 issues in the affirmative and gave judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.

The Surveyor General\u2019s plan which was marked as P2 gives the extent and boundaries of the land. In view of the statutory determination Santhonona Abeysinghe became the owner of the land referred to in the said determination. Therefore, there is no doubt as to the ownership of the land. The question that arises is as to how the Plaintiffs got the title to the land. The Plaintiffs produced the last will which was marked as P2 and the executors conveyance marked P4. However, the Plaintiffs failed to produce the letters of Probate appointing the executor. The Probate gives the executor the authority to convey the land. The probate is considered as primary evidence of the proof of the last will and the authority given to the executor to deal with the estate of the deceased testatrix. The Plaintiffs failed to produce the letter of Probate. The Defendants in view of this omission /deficiency invited the Court to draw an adverse inference under section 114 (f )of the Evidence Ordinance which states that \u201cthe evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.\u201d The learned High Court judges were of the view that the Plaintiffs had failed to adduce evidence to establish that the last will was proved in court and probate was issued. If the will was not proved the Plaintiffs who are the grand children will not inherit the land but it will devolve on Senthanona Abeysinghe\u2019s children on the basis of intestate succession. The question that arises is though the Plaintiffs failed to produce the letters of Probate which is the best evidence whether they have adduced oral and documentary evidence to establish the title.",

In this case Sunil Siriwardena, the executor a would be beneficiary on the basis of intestate succession, against his proprietary interest gave evidence in favour of the Plaintiffs. He could be accepted as a truthful witness. The executor gave evidence and stated that the last will was proved and the probate was granted to him and he conveyed the property to the legatees who are the grand children of Senthonona and the Plaintiffs in this case. In the executor conveyance marked P4 it was specifically mentioned that in the testamentary case bearing No. DC/ Colombo/ 32235 the Probate was granted to the executor Kuruwitage Don Sunil Siriwardana in respect of the estate of the deceased and in terms of the Last Will conveyed the property to the Plaintiffs. The above oral evidence placed before the District Court supported by documentary evidence proves that the Plaintiffs are the legal owners of the land in question. Their legal title was not challenged by anyone. Therefore, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs have established the title to the property. I agree with the findings of the District Judge. Therefore, I set aside the judgement of the High Court of Civil Appeal and affirm the judgement of the District Court.",
