UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The Plaintiff Appellant Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) instituted an action against the Defendant Respondent Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) seeking inter alia a declaration of title

4

to the property described in the schedule to the plaint dated 21.12.2001 and a

declaration that the deed bearing No. 2071 dated 29.03.2001 is null and void.

According to Journal Entry (J.E.) 6 dated 23.08.2002, the Appellants have tendered

an amended plaint dated 20.08.2002, to which the Respondents have filed their

statement of objections. By order dated 28.07.2004, the learned District Judge has

refused to accept the said amended plaint. Thereafter the Appellants have made

another application to amend the plaint for the second time and accordingly have

tendered the second amended plaint dated 25.05.2005. Unfortunately, the learned

District Judge, by order dated 30.09.2005, has refused to accept the the said second

amended plaint as well.

As it appears in JE 8 dated 29.11.2002, the 1st and 2nd Respondents

have filed their answers dated 28.11.2002 and 29.11.2002, respectively. The 2nd

Respondent in her answer has made a claim in reconvention. Also on 13.06.2003,

the 3rd Respondent has filed its answer dated 13.06.2003. All the Respondents have

prayed for a dismissal of the Appellant’s action. After the filing of the answer of

the 3rd Respondent on the said date, the case has been fixed for trial.

In the meantime, on 25.01.2006, the Appellants have made an

application to withdraw the plaint with liberty to file a fresh action to which the

Respondents have objected to. The learned District Judge, by order dated

17.03.2006, has allowed the said application to withdraw the plaint without liberty

to file a fresh action. The Appellants have not canvassed any of the said orders of

the learned District Judge in appellate courts.

Thereafter, upon the claim in reconvention, the case of the 2nd

Respondent has proceeded to trial on 11 issues. After trial, the learned District

Judge has delivered the judgment dated 06.03.2009 in favour of the 2nd Respondent

5

as prayed for in prayer ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the said answer. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the Appellants have preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil

Appeal holden at Mount Lavinia. The High Court has dismissed the said Appeal of

the Appellants. The Appellant sought leave to appeal to this court from the said

judgment of the High Court dated 03.10.2012 and leave was granted on the

questions of law set out in paragraph 16 of the petition of appeal dated 12.11.2012.

It is apparent from the plaint filed by the Appellant dated 21.12.2001,

that he has transferred the property described in the plaint to the 1st Respondent by

a deed of transfer bearing No 9146 dated 10.12.1996. He has averred that said deed

of transfer was made as a security for a loan obtained from the 1st Respondent and

he did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest of the land to the 1st Respondent.

The Appellant’s position was that the 1st Respondent had verbally agreed to

retransfer the said property to the Appellant upon the repayment of the money

borrowed from the 1st Respondent and the 1st Respondent has failed to do so. He

further averred that in the meantime, the 1st Respondent, by deed of transfer

bearing No. 2071 dated 29.03.2001, has transferred the said property to the 2nd

Respondent and therefore the said deed of transfer was a forgery. But the

Appellants, having thus pleaded, has withdrawn their action.

The 2nd Respondent in her answer has averred that the Appellants,

who were the owners of the land in dispute, transferred the said property to the 1st

Respondent by a deed of transfer bearing No. 9146 dated 10.12.1996 and the 1st

Respondent transferred the same to the 2nd Respondent by the deed of transfer

bearing No 2071 dated 29.03.2001. She has further averred that once she became

the owner of the land in dispute, the Appellants agreed to vacate the premises and

hand over the vacant possession thereof to the 2nd Respondent but the Appellant

has failed to do so. Accordingly, the 2nd Respondent in her claim in reconvention

6

has prayed for a declaration of title to the said land in dispute and to eject the

Appellants from the said premises.

The Appellants, in their replication has not levelled any allegation

against the said deed of transfer bearing No 2071 dated 29.03. 2001. Also they

have admitted the execution of the deed of transfer bearing No. 9146 dated

10.12.1996. They have only sought for dismissal of the claim in reconvention. On

the other hand, all the allegations levelled against the said deed of transfer bearing

No 2071 and the deed of transfer bearing No. 9146 dated 10.12.1996, now stand

dismissed since the action has been withdrawn by the Appellant. Hence. I cannot

see any forcible defence for the Appellants against the claim in reconvention of the

2nd Respondent.

In the aforesaid circumstances, I am of the view that both courts have

correctly reached their respective conclusions. Hence, I see no reason to interfere

with the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 03.10.2012. Therefore,

the appeal of the Appellants is dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
