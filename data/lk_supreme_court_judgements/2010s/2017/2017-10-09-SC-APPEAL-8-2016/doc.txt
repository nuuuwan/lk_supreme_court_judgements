Ruthiramoorthy for Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent Instructed by Sujeewa S. tissera ARGUED ON: 11.07.2017

DECIDED ON: 09.10.2017 GOONERATNE J. This was a rent and ejectment case, wherein the Plaintiff-

Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) sought to eject

the Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant) from the premises described in the 3rd schedule to the Plaint.

Defendant filed answer and sought a dismissal of the action. It is recorded that

on 23.03.2015 parties arrived at a settlement. The settlement is found at

document A3 of the brief. In short the settlement was for the Defendant to

purchase the property in dispute for Rs. 12 million on or before 28.09.2015

having been satisfied of title to the property. However in the event the

Defendant defaults, writ to issue without notice. Then on 08.05.2015 the case

came up in the District Court and the Defendant on that day informed court that

he is satisfied with title to the property in dispute.

Chronological order of events should be kept in mind as the facts

from the point of calling the case on 28.09.2015 the date relevant to the

settlement, onwards, tends to unnecessarily confuse the issue. In paragraph 5

of the Petition of Appeal it is pleaded that the Defendant on 28.09.2015 sought

4

one week’s time to pay the Rs. 12 million to Plaintiff. District Court granted time

till 05.10.2015. In this regard document A5, A6 & A8 would be relevant as a point

is emphasised by the Defendant that on the application for time to pay. District

Court granted time till 05.10.2015 and it is wrongfully recorded that Plaintiff

sought time to pay. “iu;hg meusks,a, osk m;hs”. “iu;h wjika jrg”" (vide

A6).

The material available suggest that the Plaintiff filed a Leave to

Appeal Application in the Civil Appellate High Court against the Order of the

District Judge dated 28.09.2015 (granting time to pay the Rs. 12 million). The

said Leave to Appeal Application was made to the Civil Appellate High Court on

the footing that the District Judge misdirected himself by granting time as

aforesaid and failed to appreciate that the terms of settlement cannot be

unilaterally altered and could be altered only with consent of parties. This

matter was taken up in the High Court on 02.10.2015 but after hearing parties

High Court did not set aside the order of 28.09.2015 but made order as follows

and (A7) simply stated to send the case back to the District Court to take

appropriate steps. In order to understand what the High Court Judges in his

Order stated it is necessary to incorporate same in this Order.

5

Counsel for both parties were briefly heard.

The defendant has filed this application for leave to appeal against the purported

order of the District Judge dated 28.09.2015 which appears in journal entry No. 15.

The part of the journal entry in the District Judge’s handwriting when translated into

English reads as follows: “Plaintiff moves for a date for settlement. Settlement finally

5.10.2015”. Counsel for the defendant also admits that what is recorded is incorrect.

It is the defendant, not the plaintiff, who has asked for a date to make the payment in

terms of the settlement already recorded, which was due on that day. Therefore

“Plaintiff moves for a date for settlement” is entirely wrong. Then “Settlement finally

5.10.2015” is also wrong because admittedly settlement had already been recorded.

Counsel for the plaintiff emphatically emphasises that when the defendant moved for

a date for payment, he objected to that application, but it has not been recorded.

Counsel says that if the defendant fails to make the payment on or before 28.09.2015,

according to clause 4 of the settlement recorded on 23.03.2015 in open court and

signed by the parties, the plaintiff is entitled to all the reliefs sought for in the plaint.

Counsel for the defendant says defendant moved for one week’s time to make the

payment.

What is recorded by the District Judge in journal entry No. 15 is incorrect, may be due

to the fact that the case came up before him (a new judge) for the first time on

28.09.2015.

Send a copy of these proceedings to the District Court forthwith to take appropriate

steps.

Defendant takes the position that the Order of the District Judge

wherein it is stated “iu;h wjika jrg” stands and in view of A7 the High Court

did not set aside the Order of 28.09.2015.

6

As per the Order of 28.09.2015 the matter was called in the District

Court on 05.10.2015. The Defendant party offered the 12 million in cash to the

Plaintiff but the Plaintiff did not accept the 12 million and took up the position

that in terms of the settlement between parties that on 28.09.2015 if the

moneys were not paid as aforesaid and as such the Plaintiff has a right to take

out writ against the Defendant, as the Defendant acted contrary to the terms of

settlement. Based on submissions the District Judge made Order on 08.10.2o15

permitting the Plaintiff to act according to the terms of settlement and take out

writ as per the terms of settlement (vide A8 & A9). Subsequently the Civil

Appellate High Court by Order of A17 dated 18.12.2015, dismissed the

application of the Defendant dated 12.10.2015 without costs.

The Supreme Court on 18.01.2016 granted Leave to Appeal against

the Order made by the Civil Appellate High Court by A17 dated 18.12.2015.

However the journal entry of 18.10.2016 does not refer to the question of law

on which leave was granted.

As such this court will consider the questions pleaded at paragraph

20 of the Petition of Appeal as follows: 20 (i), 20 (ii) & 20 (iii) are answered as

follows.

20(1) In view of the orders made by the High Court and District Court on

18.10.2015 and 08.10.2015 respectively question is answered in the negative.

7

Terms of settlement could not have been altered unilaterally. Defendant need

to comply with the terms of settlement between parties as the final date to pay

the sum of Rs. 12 million was on 28.09.2015. Plaintiff never consented to grant

further time for settlement.

In view of above and the views expressed by all the courts

connected to this application the rest of the questions are answered in the

negative.

It is a common ground that the Defendant failed to act as per the

terms of settlement and pay the sum of Rs. 12 million on or before 28.09.2015.

In the event if payment was not duly paid as above, Plaintiff as per the terms of

settlement would be entitled to take out writ and entitled to the relief as per

the prayer to the plaint. Though the Defendant party has right along attempted

to unnecessarily confuse the matter the simple way to look at this case is that

there was settlement for which both parties agreed and in breach of such

agreement plaintiff would be entitled to relief and take out the writ as agreed

between parties. This is in fact the crux of matter as explained by a very

comprehensive order dated 18.12.2015 of the Civil Appellate High Court. I see

no basis to interfere with that Order of the High Court. (Order of the High Court

dated 02.10.2015 very correctly explain the correct position in this case).

8

I have also perused the Order of the learned District Judge of

08.10.2015. In that Order trial Judge refer to the factually incorrect statement

highlighted by the High Court to be relevant, i.e settlement finally on

05.10.2015. This statement of the trial Judge is totally incorrect as the terms of

settlement were previously entered and there is no question of extending the

date for settlement. Defendant seems to be attempting to make use of this

incorrect and factually incorrect statement. To be more precise and give more

clarity to the issue I incorporate the following paragraph from the learned

District Judge’s Order of 08.10.2015.
