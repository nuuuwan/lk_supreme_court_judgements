The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Plaintiff-Respondent) filed DC Case No 15127/L in the District Court of

Anuradahapura asking for a declaration of title to the land described in the Plaint

and to eject the Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the Defendant-Appellant) from the said land.

4

The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 2.10.1998, dismissed the

action of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the

learned District Judge, the Plaintiff-Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal

and the Court of Appeal by its judgment dated 2.7.2013 allowed the appeal and set

aside the judgment of the learned District Judge. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Defendant-Appellant has appealed to this

court. This court by its order dated 16.9.2015 granted leave to appeal on the

questions of law set out in paragraphs 13 (a),(b),(d) and (g) of the petition of

appeal dated 7.8.2013 which are set out below.

1. Has the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal failed to consider the fact that

the purported grant could not be considered as a valid grant before law?

2. Has the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal failed to evaluate the fact that

the Petitioner’s (Defendant-Appellant) right should be given priority in

considering the ownership of the subsequence?

3. Has the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal failed and neglected to

consider the Petitioner’s (Defendant-Appellant) possession and

improvements effected to the subject matter by the Petitioner (Defendant-

Appellant)?

4. Has the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal failed to consider the fact that

the Petitioner (Defendant-Appellant) was at least entitled for compensation

for the improvements?

The Plaintiff- Respondent took up the position in her evidence that His Excellency

the President on 9.8.1982 issued a Grant in terms of Section 19(4) of the Land

Development Ordinance in her name in respect of the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint and that therefore she is the owner of the said property. The

Grant was marked as P2 in evidence.

5

The Defendant Appellant stated in evidence that she received a permit

(marked V1) in respect of the land in dispute on 2.9.1988 and that she is the owner

of the land in dispute. Although the grant marked P2 was issued on 9.8.1982 the

Plaintiff-Respondent received it only in 1992. Before she received the said grant,

permit marked V2 had been issued in the name of the Defendant Appellant in

1988. Considering the above matters the learned District Judge rejected the claim

of the Plaintiff-Respondent. In order to answer the question whether the conclusion

reached by the learned District Judge is correct or not, it is relevant to consider the

evidence of Bandrage Somarathne who is an officer attached to the Divisional

Secretary. He stated, in his evidence, that a permit issued under the Land

Development Ordinance could not invalidate a Grant issued by His Excellency the

President. But the learned District Judge disregarded this evidence and rejected the

claim of the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Can a Grant issued by His Excellency the President in terms of Section

19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance be invalidated or cancelled by a permit

issued in terms of Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance? When a

Grant under Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance is issued by His

Excellency the President, the grantee has been declared as the owner of the

property. This declaration is found in the Grant. But when a permit in terms of

Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance is issued by the land

Commissioner, the person who is given the possession of the land is declared as

the permit holder. This declaration is found in the permit. Therefore when a person

becomes an owner of a land on the basis of a Grant issued by His Excellency the

President, another permit issued in terms of Section 19(2) of the Land

6

Development Ordinance in the name of another person whilst the Grant is in

existence cannot invalidate or cancelled the Grant. When the court is invited to

answer the question whether the Grant or the permit which has better status in the

ownership of the land, the following observation will have to be made. A Grant

issued in terms of Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance has to be

considered as a deed conveying the title to the grantee by the State. But the same

status cannot be given in respect a permit issued in terms of Section 19(2) of the

Land Development Ordinance. The permit holder has only permission to possess

the land and he gets sufficient title to enable him to maintain a vindicatory action

against a trespasser but not against the grantee. This view is supported by the

judicial decision in Palisena Vs Perera 56 NLR 407 wherein His Lordship Justice

Gratiaen held thus; “A permit holder under land Development Ordinance enjoys a

sufficient title to enable him to maintain a vindicatory action against a trespasser.”

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant contended that the Plaintiff-

Respondent had failed to discharge his burden regarding the identification of the

corpus. But at the beginning of the case both parties had admitted that the subject

matter of the case was the land described in the schedule to the plaint. Therefore

the above contention cannot be accepted. Learned counsel for the Defendant-

Appellant further contended that the Plaintiff-Respondent had not discharged his

burden regarding the title of the land. But the Plaintiff-Respondent had, in his

evidence, produced the Grant issued by His Excellency the President as P2.

Therefore the above contention cannot be accepted. In any event the Defendant

Appellant cannot make any claim to the land described in the plaint on the strength

of the permit marked V2 as the land described in the said permit relates to Lot

No.338H in Plan No. ISPH 1. It has to be noted here that that the land described in

7

the plaint and the Grant marked P2 is Lot No.771 in Plan No ISPH 1. It is therefore

seen that the land described in the permit marked V2 is different from the land

described in the plaint.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the learned District

Judge was wrong when he reached the above conclusion (the conclusion reached in

his judgment dated 2.10.1998) and that the Court of Appeal was correct when it

reached the above conclusion. In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer

the above questions of law in the negative. For the above reasons, I grant the relief

claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of the prayer to

the plaint. The learned District Judge is directed to enter decree in accordance with

this judgment. I affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 2.7.2013 and

dismiss the appeal of the Defendant Appellant with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
