Argued on : 15.2.2017 Decided on : 16.3.2017 Sisira J De Abrew J.

This is an appeal by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellant) against the judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court dated 21.2.2012 wherein the Judges of the Civil Appellate

High Court set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 13.2.2008.

The learned District Judge held in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellant. Being

aggrieved by the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff-

Appellant has appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 18.7.2013,

granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law.

1. Did the Civil Appellate High Court Judges err in law by accepting the

validity of deed No.6984 (V2)?

2. Were the learned High Court Judges in error by allowing the appeal of the

Respondent holding that there was no issue challenging the validity of deed

marked V2 whereas issues No. 5,6 and 12 dealt with regard to the title of the

Defendant and the learned District Judge answered the said issues against

the Defendant and whereas the Respondent had not prayed for a dismissal of

the action of the Petitioner?

The Plaintiff-Appellant instituted this action in the District Court seeking a

declaration of title to the property in suit. The Plaintiff-Appellant, in her evidence,

has taken up the position that by Deed No.3750 dated 2.10.1966 attested by DS

Wickramasingha Notary Public, she became the owner of the property in suit and

4

that she did not sell the said property to the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondent) by Deed

No.6984 dated 5.8.1988 marked V2. The Defendant-Respondent has taken up the

position, in his evidence, that the Plaintiff-Appellant, by Deed No.6984 dated

5.8.1988 attested by Priya. S. Bandara Notary Public (V2) has sold the property in

suit to him. He states, in his evidence, that both the Plaintiff-Appellant and her

husband signed the said deed. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant

contended that Deed No.6984 was a forged deed as the Plaintiff-Appellant had not

signed the said deed. He further submitted that the Plaintiff-Appellant in her

evidence had stated that she had not sold the property. I now advert to this

contention. Was there an issue at the trial to the effect that the Deed No.6984 was a

forged deed? The answer is in the negative. This shows that the Plaintiff-Appellant

had not contested the Deed No.6984. If the Deed No.6984 was a forged deed, one

would expect the Plaintiff-Appellant to make a complaint to the police. When the

Plaintiff-Appellant was cross-examined by the Defendant- Respondent whether she

made a complaint to the police to the said effect, she answered in the negative. It is

important to note that both parties admitted at the trial that the Plaintiff-Appellant

by Deed No.3750 referred to above, became the owner of the property in suit and

reference with regard to the said deed has also been made in the Deed No.6984.

From the above matters, it is clear that the Plaintiff-Appellant has not proved that

the Deed No.6984 was a forged deed.

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant contended that as the Deed

No.6984 had not been registered in the proper folio in the Land Registry, the

Defendant- Respondent has not got the title. I now advert to this contention. It is

correct that the Deed No.6984 was not registered in the proper folio in the Land

Registry. If a deed was not registered in the proper folio in the Land Registry and

5

the said deed is challenged on the basis that another deed on the same property was

registered in the proper folio, the deed registered in the proper folio, gets the

priority of registration and validity over the other deed. But if there is no contesting

deed, the deed that was not registered in the proper folio does not lose its validity

and in such a situation, in my view, the purchaser of the property does not lose title

of the property merely because it was not registered in the proper folio in the Land

Registry. For the above reasons, I reject the above contention of learned counsel

for the Plaintiff-Appellant.

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant contended that the Deed

No.6984 was not a valid deed as the Notary Public who attested the deed, in her

attestation, has stated that the Plaintiff-Appellant signed the deed when in fact she

did not sign it. I now advert to this contention. The Plaintiff-Appellant placed her

left thumb impression in the said deed as she was a person who could not sign.

When the deed No.6984 is examined, it is clear that the Notary Public who attested

the deed has made a note on the same page to the following effect. “This left

thumb impression is the thumb impression of KM Bandara Manike.” KM Bandara

Manike is the Plaintiff-Appellant. Thus it appears that the Notary Public has

certified the thumb impression appearing in the Deed No.6984 is the thumb

impression of the Plaintiff-Appellant. When a person cannot sign, his or her left

thumb impression is placed on the document. It has to be considered as his or her

signature. An examination of Deed No.6984 reveals that the other vendor (the

husband of the Plaintiff-Appellant) and two attesting witnesses have signed the

deed. When I consider the above matters I hold that the Notary Public who attested

the deed has not committed any mistake and that the Plaintiff-Appellant and her

husband have signed the deed. For the above reasons, I reject the above contention

of learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant.

6

It is important to consider whether the deed No.6984 is a valid deed or not.

KM Sirisena one of the attesting witnesses of the deed No.6984 gave evidence. He

stated that two vendors placed their signatures and thereafter two attesting

witnesses (one of them was Sirisena) signed the deed. He further stated in his

evidence that the Notary Public and the other attesting witness are dead. When I

consider his evidence I hold that the validity of the Deed No.6984 has been proved.

Having considered all the above matters, I hold that the Plaintiff-Appellant

has not proved his title to the property in suit. A person who seeks a declaration of

title to the property in suit must prove his title. This view is supported by the

following judicial decisions.

In Peeris Vs Savunhamy 54 NLR 207 Supreme Court held as follows:

“Where, in an action for declaration of title to land, the defendant is in

possession of the land in dispute the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that

he has dominium.”

In Loku Menika and Others Vs Gunasekare [1997] 2 SLR 281 Court of

Appeal held as follows.

“The plaintiff must set out his title on the basis on which he claims a

declaration of title to the land and must prove that title against the

defendant.”

Since the Plaintiff-Appellant has not proved his title to the property in suit, he

cannot be declared the owner of the property and his action should fail.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the questions of law in the negative.

7

For the above reasons, I affirm the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court and

dismiss this appeal with costs.
