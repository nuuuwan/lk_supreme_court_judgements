COUNSEL: Suren Fernando with K. Wickramanayake For the Respondent-Respondent-Appellants D.P.L.A.K. Perera for the Applicant-Appellant-Respondent ARGUED ON: 07.03.2017 DECIDED ON: 31.03.2017 GOONERATNE J. The Respondent-Respondent-Appellants challenge the Judgment

dated 10.02.2014 of the Southern Provincial High Court Holden in Matara, by

which Order the Labour Tribunal, Matara was reversed. The Labour Tribunal

held with the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (employer) that the

termination of employment of Applicant-Appellant was justified. However the

High Court reversed the Order and awarded compensation equivalent to five

year’s salary, but did not order reinstatement of the Applicant Employee.

The Supreme Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law, referred to in paragraph 14 of the petition.

4

(a) Did the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court fail to assess the

evidence in deciding that the termination of the employment of the

Applicant was not just, equitable and/or reasonable?

(b) Did the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court err in law in analysing

and applying the applicable principle of the law of evidence and especially

the burden of proof?

(e) Did the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court err in law in failing to

properly analyse and apply the principles of law pertaining to loss of

confidence?

(g) In any event did the learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to

analyse and apply the applicable legal principles and/or evidence

pertaining to mitigation of loss and calculation of compensation?

(h) In any event did the learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to

recognise that the Applicant had not led satisfactory evidence to

demonstrate that he had attempted to mitigate his losses and/or that he

had suffered actual loss?

The Applicant employee was a Factory Tea Officer of the Belmont

Tea Factory. He was interdicted by the Estate Superintendent on 20.07.2009 and

thereafter his services were terminated on 10.11.2009 after a disciplinary

inquiry. The reason for the employee’s dismissal from service as stated by the

learned High Court Judge was because there was a shortage of 791 kilograms of

tea at a particular time and that the Applicant had not contested the said

shortage nor gave any explanation for the shortage.

5

The learned High Court Judge concurred with the views expressed

by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal on the following. The quantity

of tea relevant to the shortage had been in the custody of the employee

concerned and he had been negligent in his duties and had not acted in the

manner as required by an experience officer. As such a substantial loss had been

caused to the employer.

Perusal of the Judgment I also find that the High Court had been

critical of the domestic inquiry, held by the employer. Further the learned High

Court Judge observes that, the opportunity to provide an explanation had been

deprived to the Employee –Applicant.

Whatever it may be the available material suggest that the

Applicant had been negligent in the performance of his duties, which resulted in

a loss to the employer. Therefore the principles relating to loss of confidence

would apply. In any employment there is a certain amount of trust that is

expected by an employee. When a loss of this nature takes place employer

cannot continue employment of the employee. The only way out would be

termination of services. In the case in hand it is unfortunate that the employee

has lost opportunities to explain his bona fides. Nevertheless I am of the view

that his termination of services in the circumstances is justified. The learned

High Court Judges has awarded compensation. In these circumstances the

6

question is whether it is just and equitable to award compensation to an

employee who worked for about 10 years.

I note the following case law on loss of confidence.

1. It has been judicially recognized that:

“It seems to be that by reason of the part played by the applicant in two transactions which, to say the least, were questionable, he has clearly forfeited the confidence reposed in him as an employee of the Bank. In these circumstances, the Bank should not and cannot continue to employ him” Bank of Ceylon V. Manivasagasivam (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 79, 83 2. It has been unequivocally recognized that:

“Whether the misconduct relates to the discharge of his duties in the bank or not, if it reflects on the bankman’s honesty, it renders him unfit to serve in a bank and justifies dismissal”. National Savings Bank v. Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union (1982) 2 Sri L.R. 629, 632

In Rumblan Vs. Ceylon Press Workers Union 75 NLR 575

Where the dismissal of a workman who has caused continuing loss to his employer is

justified, no compensation can be awarded to him by a Labour Tribunal.

Wataraka Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. V. Wickremachandra 70

N.L.R.

Pg. 239.

When a workman’s services are terminated by the employer on the ground of

inefficiency, there is no burden on the employer to prove that he acted without malice in

dismissing the workman. In such a case, if there was neither illegality nor any finding that the

7

dismissal for inefficiency was an unfair labour practice it is an error of law to award any

compensation to the workman under section 33 (1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

70 N.L.R. 239..

In Peiris Vs. Celtel Lanka Ltd. 2012(1) SLR at 179

The concept of loss of confidence has been well expressed in the following terms:

“The contractual relationship as between employer and employee so far as it concerns a

position of responsibility is founded essentially on the confidence one has in the other and in

the event of incident which adversely effects that confidence the very foundation on which

the contractual relationship is built should necessarily collapse .... Once this link in the chain

of the contractual relationship .... snaps it would illogical or unreasonable to bind one party

to fulfil his obligations towards the other. Otherwise it would really mean an employer being

compelled to employ a person in a position of responsibility even though he has no

confidence in the latter”. (Vide Democratic Workers’ Congress vs. De Mel and Wanigasekara.

The material furnished to this court no doubt suggests that the

shortage or goods went missing whilst in the possession of the Applicant

Employee. The learned High Court Judge as well as the President of the Labour

Tribunal took the view that the Applicant Employee was responsible for the loss.

The High Court Judge of course observes that there was insufficient material to

pursue a criminal charge against the employee. However the standard of proof

in the Labour Tribunal is not proof based on beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore this court takes the view that loss of confidence and misconduct are

both matters that relate to loss of goods from the tea factory. As such as stated

8

in the above authorities the Employer cannot be bound to fulfil his obligations,

in a case of this nature.

I have noted the submissions of the Applicant-Appellant-

Respondent. The submissions no doubt support the order of the learned High

Court Judge and merely express the views of the learned High Court Judge, and

more particularly refer to the written submissions filed in the Matara High Court.

Emphasis is on the question of there being no proof of any fraud or moral

turpitude and there is no grave misconduct that warrants the termination of

services.

The termination of services of an employee is a very grave

punishment. In the case in hand I have already observed that there is loss of

confidence of the employer. In these circumstances employer cannot continue

to employ the Applicant-Employee. As stated by the learned High Court Judge

loss could have been recovered from the employee at that point of time. These

are matters that could have been considered but the Factory Tea Officer holds

a key position in the industry and is responsible for running the Tea Estate

efficiently and the employer is dependent on such an officer. As such the

employer cannot continue to incur loses of this nature. If not the resulting

position may give rise to a collapse of the industry.

9

In all the above circumstances this court takes the view that the

termination of employment is justified in the circumstances of the case in hand,

but having considered the position of either party, I do agree with the award of

compensation by the High Court Judge, but the amount need to be varied, to a

period of one (1) year based on the last salary (20,638x12).The questions of law

are answered as follows:

(a) Yes

(b) Yes

(e) Yes

(g) No

(h) Yes

Subject to the above this appeal is partly allowed without costs.
