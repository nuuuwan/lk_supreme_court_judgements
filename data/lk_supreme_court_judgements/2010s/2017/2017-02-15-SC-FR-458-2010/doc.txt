The Petitioner in this case seeks a declaration that his fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated

3

by the Respondents. This court by its order dated 10.2.2012 granted leave to

proceed for alleged violation of Article 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner, in April 1975, joined the Sri Lanka Army as a soldier and in1985

was promoted to the 7th Military Intelligence Unit as a Lance Corporal. In 2003 he

left the Sri Lanka Army without permission. In 2006 he was apprehended by the

Sri Lanka Army and was sent to Singha Regiment in Nuwara Eliya. During the

period commencing from 2003 to 2006 he worked as a lorry driver. On 27.2.2010,

the officers of the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) led by the 5th Respondent

arrested the Petitioner informing him that they wanted to record a statement from

him. The Petitioner states that he was not informed of the reasons for his arrest. At

the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), he was asked whether he knew a

person by the name of Pitchchai Jesudasan. As he could not recollect the name of

such person, he was shown a photograph of a person said to be Pitchchai

Jesudasan. The Petitioner then identified the person in the photograph as Das. Das

was a motor mechanic in Nuwara Eliya. He (the Petitioner) explained to the

officers of the TID when he was working as a lorry driver, he used to take his lorry

to Das’s garage for repairs and that on some occasions he had consumed liquor

with Das. The Petitioner further states that he was questioned with regard to the

murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga. On 26.5.2010 he was produced before the

Magistrate’s Court, Colombo and was transferred to the Remand Prison. He has

produced a copy of the case record of the Magistrate’s Court as P1 and a copy of

the detention order as P2. On 10.11.2010 he was discharged from the proceedings

in the Magistrate’s Court (MC Colombo B 4855/8/2010) on the basis that no

further legal action would be pursued against him. Pitchchai Jesudasan too was

discharged on the same basis. The Petitioner states although he was discharged

from the proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court, Colombo, he was added as a

suspect to the proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court Mount Lavinia B 92/2009

4

regarding the murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga. The Petitioner states that his

arrest and detention are illegal and that his arrest and detention constitute

continuing infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed Article 12(1) and

13(1) of the Constitution.

The 2nd Respondent who is in charge of the Terrorist Investigation Division

of the CID in his affidavit states that the investigation which was conducted by

Mirihana Police regarding the murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga was

subsequently handed over to the CID on 17.12.2009; that Lasantha Wickramatunga

had received telephone calls from five mobile numbers prior to his death; that the

Sim Cards pertaining to the said mobile numbers had been purchased by a person

holding National Identity Card (NIC) number 711713050V; that the investigation

had revealed that said NIC belongs to one Pitchchai Jesudasan of Nuwara Eliya;

that when Pitchchai Jesudasan was arrested it was revealed that he had lost his NIC

in 2008; that the said Sim Cards had been purchased subsequent to the loosing of

his NIC; that the investigation had revealed that Pitchchai Jesudasan had lost his

wallet after he consumed liquor with the Petitioner in August 2008; that acting on

this information the Petitioner was arrested on 27.2.2010; and that the said Sim

Cards had been purchased from a communication centre which was situated

opposite the Military Camp where the Petitioner was attached to. The officer who

arrested the Petitioner has not filed an affidavit in this court. Arresting notes had

not been produced by any Respondent. The 2nd Respondent is the only respondent

who has filed an affidavit in this case.

One of the important questions that must be decided in this case is whether the

above information furnished by the 2nd Respondent in his affidavit justifies the

arrest of the Petitioner. There was no evidence or material to suggest that Pitchchai

Jesudasan’s NIC was in the possession of the Petitioner nor was there any material

to suggest that the Petitioner had purchased the said Sim Cards. Merely because

5

Pitchchai Jesudasan lost his wallet after consuming liquor with the Petitioner, there

is nothing to suggest that the Petitioner had stolen his wallet and the NIC. From the

matters set out in the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent, there was no material, in my

view, for the arresting officer to form the opinion that he had reasonable grounds

or reasonable suspicion to arrest the Petitioner. In the case of Joseph alias Bruten

Perera Vs. The Attorney General [1992] 1 SLR page 99 His Lordship Justice

Wanasundera remarked thus; “The power of arrest does not depend on the

requirement that there must be clear and sufficient proof of the commission of the

offence alleged. On the other hand for an arrest, a mere reasonable suspicion or a

reasonable complaint of the commission of an offence suffices.”

When I consider the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent, I hold the view that the

arresting officer (the 5th Respondent), at the time of arrest, did not have sufficient

material to justify the above principle laid down in the above judgment.

For the above reasons, I hold that the arrest of the Petitioner is illegal.

The article 12(1) of the Constitution is as follows.

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the

law.”

Article 13(1) of the Constitution is as follows.

“No person shall be arrested except according to the procedure established by law.

Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.”

When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the 5th Respondent

has violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1)

and 13(1) of the Constitution.

6

The next question that must be considered is whether the fundamental rights of

the Petitioner had been violated when the Petitioner was detained after the arrest.

The Detention order dated 27.2.2010 had been issued by the 4th Respondent. But

the 4th Respondent has not filed any affidavit in this court. Did the 2nd Respondent

forward any report to the 4th Respondent for the purpose of obtaining the detention

order? The 2nd Respondent in his affidavit does not attach any such report. This

shows that the 2nd Respondent had not forwarded any report to the 4th Respondent

for the purpose of obtaining the detention order. The arrest of the Petitioner was on

27.2.2010. The detention order was also issued on the same day. I have earlier held

that the 5th Respondent did not have reasonable grounds to arrest the Petitioner. If

the 5th Respondent did not have reasonable grounds to arrest the Petitioner on

27.2.2010, there could not have been any material to issue a detention order on the

same day. As I pointed out earlier there is nothing to indicate that a report had been

forwarded to the 4th Respondent to sign a detention order. The 2nd Respondent

states in his affidavit that the Petitioner was discharged on 22.8.2013 by the

learned Magistrate on the advice of the Attorney General. In considering the case

against the 4th respondent, two factors are possible. One is that the 2nd Respondent

or the 5th Respondent verbally made incorrect representation to the 4th Respondent

and persuaded him to sign the detention order or the other possibility is that the 4th

Respondent signed the detention order knowingly that there was no material

against the Petitioner. The 4th Respondent is not an investigator or a police officer.

He is only an additional secretary attached to the Ministry of Defence. It is difficult

to think that he, knowingly that there was no material against the Petitioner, signed

the detention order. When I consider all these matters, I feel that it is not proper for

me to find the 4th Respondent guilty for violating the fundamental rights of the

Petitioner.

7

I have earlier held that the 5th Respondent has violated the fundamental rights of

the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution.

Considering all these matters, I make order that the 5th Respondent should pay

Rs.100,000/- to the Petitioner for violating his fundamental rights. The 5th

Respondent is directed to pay the above amount of money (Rs.100,000/-) to the

petitioner within three months from the date of this judgment.
