and Thrishana Potupitiya for the Petitioner.

Sanjay Rajaratnam, P.C., Additional Solicitor General for the Attorney General. WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS : 20.12.2016 by the Petitioner 07.12.2016 by the Respondents ARGUED ON : 30.11.2016 DECIDED ON : 16.01.2017 K. SRIPAVAN, C.J., The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on the basis that her two transfers out of

Royal College were effected by the 10th Respondent contrary to the transfer scheme

approved by the Public Service Commission. Leave to proceed was granted on 02.12.2011

for the alleged violation of the Petitioner’s fundamental right enshrined in Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

The Petitioner sought, inter alia, declarations

(a) that the decision of the 10th Respondent to transfer the Petitioner to Gampaha

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya contained in the letter dated 27.09.2011 marked P10 is

null and void; and

(b) that the decision of the 10th Respondent to transfer the Petitioner to the Ministry

of Education contained in the letter dated 28.09.2011 marked P11 is null and

void.

Though several parties filed Petitions to intervene in this application, all parties withdrew

their applications for intervention on 13.05.2013 as the Court directed that the entire

application be confined to the original Petition dated 18.10.2011.

The procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission published in the Government

Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 1589/30 dated 20th February 2009 deals with the types of

transfers that could be effected. Clause 196 of the said Rules reads thus :

“Transfers are fourfold as indicated below

(i) Transfers done annually;

(ii) Transfers done on exigencies of service;

(iii) Transfers done on disciplinary grounds;

(iv) Mutual Transfers on requests made by Officers.”

It was not in dispute that the Petitioner was initially transferred by P10 to Gampaha

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya and the next day to the Ministry of Education by P11. None of the

transfer orders convey any reasons to the Petitioner for such transfers as contemplated in

Clauses 221 and 222 of the Procedural Rules. Giving of reasons is an essential element of

administration of justice. A right to reason is, therefore, an indispensable part of a sound

system of judicial review. Reasoned decision is not only for the purpose of showing that the

citizen is receiving justice, but also a valid discipline for the administrative body itself.

Conveying reasons is calculated to prevent unconscious, unfairness or arbitrariness in

reaching the conclusions. The very search for reasons will put the authority on the alert and

minimize the chances of unconscious infiltration of bias or unfairness in the conclusion. The

duty to adduce reasons will be regarded as fair and legitimate by a reasonable man and will

discard irrelevant and extraneous considerations. Therefore, conveying reasons is one of the

essentials of justice (Vide S. N. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India (1990) 4 S.CC.C. 594; A.I.R. 1990

S.C. 1984)

When leave to proceed was granted on 02.12.2011, this Court made the following

observations :

“ If the transfer is on “exigencies of service” or a “transfer on disciplinary grounds” in

terms of Rules 221 and/or 222, the appointing authority is mandated to convey the

reasons for such transfers in writing to the Officer concerned. The documents marked

P10 and P11 do not give any reasons.

They do not disclose the grounds upon which such transfers were

made…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Since the Petitioner has now preferred an appeal to the Public Service Commission on

the impugned transfer the Public Service Commission is free to take a decision on the

appeal made by the Petitioner. …”

However, the Public Service Commission having considered the appeal made by the

Petitioner, made the following determination as evidenced by the Document marked 10R3

“Admittedly, the Secretary to the Ministry of Education has acted contrary to the

Public Service Commission’s Rules and failed to give reasons for the said transfer,

which is not a transfer made on Annual Transfer Scheme. One of the complaints

made by several Teachers of Royal College at Preliminary Investigation referred to

below is that the Ministry of Education has failed to implement the transfer scheme

in a meaningful manner.

In fact, the reasons for the transfer were given to the Public Service Commission very

much later (after several reminders)

Taking all matters into consideration, we have no hesitation in coming to the

conclusion that the transfer ordered by letters dated 27th September 2011 and 28th

September 2011 is ex facie wrongful and contrary to the Public Service Commission

Rules in respect of transfers of Public Officers.”

The Petitioner’s appeal to the Public Service Commission was decided in her favour in as

much as the said Commission held that the said transfer orders were bad in law and pro

forma set aside the said orders; however, the Public Service Commission refused to transfer

the Petitioner back to Royal College. As a general rule, the rights of parties must be

determined as at the commencement of the action. Thus, the Petitioner is entitled for the

declarations sought in the prayer to the Petition.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioner is now

functioning as the Acting Principal of St. Paul’s College, Milagiriya and does not seek an

6

order of re-transfer to Royal College. The Court therefore holds that the decision of the 10th

Respondent to transfer the Petitioner to Gampaha Bandaranayake Vidyalaya by letter dated

27.09.2011 marked P10 and the subsequent decision of the 10th Respondent to transfer the

Petitioner to the Ministry of Education by letter dated 28.09.2011 marked P11 are null and

void and has no force or avail.

The Court further declares that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution was infringed by the 10th Respondent. At the hearing before us,

learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner indicated to Court that the Petitioner is not

seeking compensation against the Respondents. Accordingly, no compensation is awarded

against the Respondents.
