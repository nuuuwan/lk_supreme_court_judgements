Sisira J de Abrew, J

Heard both counsel in support of their respective cases. This is an application

by the Petitioner for a declaration that his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of

the Constitution have been violated. This Court by its order dated 29.09.2014 granted leave to

proceed for the alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Petitioner alleges that he,

on an advertisement published in P13, applied for the Post of Director Bio Medical Engineering

Services Division in the Ministry of Health. He went for the interview but he was not

selected. Petitioner further alleges that the 7th Respondent was selected for the said post.

Learned President’s counsel appearing for the Petitioner contends that the

marks given to the 7th Respondents are in appropriate. The Petitioner was given 15 marks for

his post graduate qualification. The 7th Respondent was given 20 marks for his post graduate

qualification. The Petitioner contends that allocation of the said 20 marks to the 7th Respondent

is not correct.

The main question that must be decided in this case is whether allocation of 20

marks to the 7th Respondent by the Interview Board is correct or not. The 7th Respondent has

been given 20 marks on the basis that he was having a MSc qualification in Medical Physics.

The question that must be considered is whether the Medical physics is in the marking scheme

in P13 and the job description in P13(a). P13 carries a statement that a candidate who is having

a MSc qualification is entitled to 20 marks but the said 20 marks must come under the

educational qualification in the relevant field. P13(a) is a document which gives the job

description. When we consider the contents in P13(a), we find that the MSc in Medical

Physics does not come under the job description.

SC(FR) No. 175/2014

When we examine P13, we find that the MSc in Medical Physics does not

come under the relevant educational qualification too. The 3rd Respondent who was a member

of the interview panel by a letter dated 12.02.2014 (P14) has included MSc in Medical

Physics in the field of relevant qualification. But it is to be noted that this letter has been

issued after the application for the Post of Director Bio Medical Engineering Services was

closed. The application for the said post was closed on 07.02.2014. This is evident by document

marked P13. The 3rd Respondent has brought MSc in Medical Physics into the field of relevant

qualification only on 12.02.2014 by letter marked P14. Therefore it is clear that MSc in

Medical Physics has been brought into the category of relevant qualification only after the

application for the relevant post was closed. When we examine the aforementioned matters,

we feel that the 3rd Respondent has impliedly admitted that the MSc in Medical Physics

was not in the marking scheme set out in P13 and in the job description P13(a).

Therefore we feel that the P14 was introduced for the purpose of bringing MSc

in Medical Physics into the field of relevant qualification and job description.

Since the MSc in Medical Physics was not in the marking scheme (P13) and

in the job description in P13(a), we feel that the allocation of 20 marks to the 7th Respondent

was illegal. We therefore hold that the 7th Respondent was not entitled to the 20 marks given

by the members of the Interview panel on 07.03.2014. The fact that the 7th Respondent was

given 20 marks for the MSc in Medical Physics is clearly found in the document marked 3R6.

This document has been signed by the 3rd, 4th,5th, 6th Respondents and another person called

N.W.Ariyarathna. For the above reason, we hold that the allocation of said 20 marks to the 7th

Respondent is illegal. Therefore the 7th Respondent could not have been selected for the Post

of Director, Bio Medical Engineering Services Division in the Ministry of Health.

SC(FR) No. 175/2014

Learned S/DSG submitted that the necessary parties are not before Court. He based his

objection on the basis that all members who signed 3R6 which is the mark sheet of the

Interview panel are not before Court. That mark sheet has been signed by the 3rd, 4th,5th,6th

Respondents and one N.W.Ariyarathna. N.W.Ariyarathna has not been brought before Court.

Although the learned S/DSG takes up the said objection, he admits that the said objection has

not been pleaded in his statement of objection. Learned President’s Counsel submitted that at

the time of filing the petition, the Petitioner was unaware of the names of all members of the

Interview Board. In our view the Petitioner's case should not be dismissed on the said objection.

When we consider the above matters, we hold that there is no merit in the objection raised by

the learned S/DSG.

For the above reasons, we hold that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the 3rd,4th,5th and 6th Respondents.

We earlier held that allocation of 20 marks by the interview panel to the 7th Respondent is

illegal. For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that the appointment given to the 7th

Respondent based on the marks given at the Interview Board is illegal. The 7th Respondent has

been appointed to the Post of Director, Bio Medical Engineering Services by the document

marked P19. We quash the said letter marked P19 and we declare that the appointment of the 7th

Respondent to the Post of Director Bio Medical Engineering Services Division in the Ministry

of Health is null and void.

The Interview Board has given 69 marks to the 7th Respondent. We have earlier held that

allocation of 20 marks is illegal. Therefore the 7th Respondent is entitled only to 49 marks. The

Interview Board has given 67 marks to the Petitioner. Therefore the Petitioner is entitled to be

appointed to the Post of Director, Bio Medical Engineering Services Division in the Ministry of

Health.

SC(FR) No. 175/2014

We direct the 26th Respondent ( the Public Service Commission) to appoint the Petitioner to the

Post of Director , Bio Medical Engineering Services Division in the Ministry of Health within

01 month from today. The Deputy Director General of Bio Medical Engineering Services (3rd

Respondent) is directed to take necessary legal steps to implement this Judgment. The Registrar

of this Court is directed to send certified copies of this Judgment to the 3rd Respondent and 17th

to 26th Respondents.

Petition allowed.
