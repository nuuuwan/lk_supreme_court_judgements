ARGUED& DECIDED ON : 05.12.2017 Sisira J. de Abrew, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective

cases.

Learned Counsel appearing for the Accused-Appellant-

Petitioner raises a following question of law:-

Has the Court of Appeal failed to consider the defence case?

We have perused the judgment of the Court of Appeal

and we find that the written submissions filed by the Attorney General

have been reproduced from word to word in the judgment. Thereafter Her

Ladyship has written two sentences affirming the conviction and the

sentence. We therefore, hold that the Court of Appeal has failed to

consider the Appellant’s case and severe prejudice has been caused to the

Accused-Appellant in this case.

In our view, when the Appellate Court considers an

appeal it becomes the sacred duty of that Court to consider arguments for

both sides. When the Appellate Court reproduces the written submissions

filed by the Attorney General and writes a few sentences affirming the

conviction, (the Appellate Court) fails to perform its sacred duty.

It is not the duty of the Court of Appeal to reproduce

the written submissions filed by one party in the judgment and give the

judgment in favour of the party who filed written submissions. The Court

SC. Spl. LA. No. 66/2017

of Appeal in this case after reproducing the written submissions filed by

the Attorney General in its judgment, has dismissed the appeal.

In these circumstances, we answer the above

questions of law in the affirmative.

In our view the judgment of the Court of Appeal cannot

be permitted to stand. We therefore set aside the judgment of the Court of

Appeal and direct the Court of Appeal to re-hear the case by a different

Bench.

Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of the

judgment to both Judges who wrote the judgment and also to the

Registrar of the Court of Appeal for their information.

Appeal allowed.
