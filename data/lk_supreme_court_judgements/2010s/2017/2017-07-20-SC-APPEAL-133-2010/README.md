UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the Defendant Appellant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) from the judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal of the Western Province holden at Colombo dated 11.06.2010. By the

said judgment, the High Court has upheld the judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Colombo dated 29.03.2007. This court has granted leave on the

4

following questions of law set out in paragraph 16 (a), (b) and (c) of the petition of

appeal dated 21st of July, 2010.

(a) When does a cause of action accrue to a customer of a Bank for

the recovery of monies said to have been erroneously debited by

such Bank from such customer’s account?

(b) Is an action filed against a Bank by a customer after the lapse of

three years from a date of a such transaction, prescribed?

(f) Is a Bank obliged to credit a customer’s account at the time of the

deposit of a cheque into such account, and before the Bank

receives monies on such cheque?

The Plaintiff Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted an action against the Appellant in the District Court of

Colombo seeking for a declaration that the Appellant is the trustee who holds a

sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50/ in trust for the Respondent and for an order directing the

Appellant to pay the Respondent the said sum held in trust together with the

interests as prayed for. The Respondent has instituted the said case on the basis that

the Appellant had charged the Respondent the aforesaid sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50/-

as interest on an overdraft facility afforded by the Appellant Bank to the

Respondent Company, in excess of the sum of which the Appellant was entitled to

recover from the Respondent.

The Appellant, by his amended answer, has sought for a dismissal of

the Respondent’s action. Further the Appellant has set out a claim in reconvention

for a sum of Rs. 249,935.12 on the basis that the Appellant Bank has undercharged

interest on the money due from the Respondent by way of an overdraft in the

Respondent’s current account.

5

The case proceeded to trial on 30 issues. Issue No 21 has been raised

by the Appellant on the basis that the cause of action of the Respondent was

prescribed in law. I first deal with the question on prescription.

The Appellant’s contention on the prescription was twofold. The

Appellant contended on the merits:

a. that the monies claimed by the Respondent from the Appellant

were not due on demand, and thus the Respondent’s action was

prescribed,

b. that even if a demand was necessary, such demand was contained

in the document P 7 which was more than 3 years before the action

was instituted, and therefore the Respondent’s action was

prescribed.

In the said premise, the learned President Counsel for the Appellant

submitted that P 7 is clearly in unequivocal terms a demand for the monies sought

for by the Respondent in the present action. By P 7 dated 16.08.1987, the

Respondent had demanded the Appellant to pay a sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50 within

one month of the date of the said letter. Said sum of money corresponds exactly

with the relief prayed for by the Respondent in its plaint of the present case.

I reproduce the said letter P 7 below;

“REGISTERED 16th August 1997

The General Manager, Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. City Office, Colombo1.

Dear Sir,

6

Information Ref:- Saifi Trading Company (M/S. Sarma & Co., Chartered Accounts) Current Account No. 1503255501 Overdraft Interest.

We refer to our last letter dated 15th November 1996 and we have now received a final report from our Auditors subsequent to their verification of overdraft interest levied by yourselves on our Account No 1503255501.

Their report attached herewith indicates an excess charge of Rs. 2,880,004.50. You are hereby requested to verify the report and refund to us the overcharge amount further together with interest within a month of this letter.

We regret to inform you should fail to refund within a month we shall be reluctantly compelled to seek legal advice to claim together with further costs and damages.

We await your serious and immediate response.

Yours faithfully

SAIFI TRADING COMPANY

Proprietor

Cc to;- The Manager (City Office), Assistant General Manager (Head Office), M/S Sarma & CO., (Charted Accountants),

186, 2/1 Dam Street, Colombo 12.”

In the completeness of the judgment I reproduce below the prayer ‘a’

and ‘b’ to the amended plaint of the said action instituted in the District Court of

Colombo;

a. for judgment for a sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50 together with interests

at 26% per annum from 25.11.1999 till decree and for interest on

the aggregate sum decreed until payment in full,

7

b. as an alternative to ‘a’

i. for a declaration that the Defendant is a trustee and holds a sum

of Rs 2,880,004.50 in trust for the Plaintiff and/or,

ii. for an order directing the Defendant to pay to the Plaintiff the

sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50 held in trust together with interest at

26% per annum from 25.11.1999 till decree and for interest on

the aggregate sum decreed until payment in full and in the event

of the Defendant failing to do so for an order directing the

Registrar of the court to take appropriate steps.

The Respondent, in the said amended plaint dated 28th of September

2001 has set out three causes of action. With regard to the first cause of action, the

Respondent in paragraph 15 of the said amended plaint has averred that by letter

dated 16.08.1997 (aforesaid P 7) the Respondent wrote to the Appellant Bank that

according to the Auditor’s Report there had been an excess charge of Rs.

2,880,004.50. But the Respondent has not averred therein that by the said letter

they demanded the Appellant to pay the said sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50.

It is manifest from the paragraphs 16 and 17 of the said amended

plaint that subsequent to the discussions held with the Appellant Bank and the

clarifications made by them, the Respondent has come to know the fact that his

Auditors who prepared the aforesaid report, in preparing the same has not taken in

to their consideration certain revisions in interests and rates levied by the Appellant

Bank against the Respondent’s said account. Also, the Respondent has admitted

that he was unaware of such revisions/changes in interest and rates levied by the

Appellant Bank against his said account. However, the Respondent has realized the

fact that the said Auditors’ Report was not prepared according to the revised

interest, charges and rates of the Appellant’s Bank and the sum demanded from the

8

Appellant by the said letter dated 16.08.1997 was incorrect and the amount,

according to the Appellant’s version, would be a sum of Rs. 1,874,392.76.

In the said premise the Respondent, in paragraph 18 of the said

amended plaint has averred that by a letter dated 25.11.1999, demanded the

Appellant to pay the Respondent the said lesser sum of Rs. 1,874,392.76 and the

Appellant denied any liability.

Having urged so, the Respondent in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the said

amended plaint has pleaded that the Appellant has acted contrary to the written

agreement in making an excess charge of Rs 2,880,004.50 and therefore a cause of

action has arisen for the Respondent to sue the Appellant in order to recover the

sum of Rs. 2,880,004.50 together with other relief. Accordingly, the Respondent’s

said three causes of action in his amended plaint has set out the said sum of Rs.

2,880,004.50, as an amount computed on a wrong basis disregarding the revised

interest, charges and rates of the Appellant’s Bank.

Witness Vithanage Rathnasiri Perera, Chartered Accountant, Sarma &

Co., in his evidence has stated that when a cheque is deposited into an account on

the day of the deposit, it was shown in the statement of account that the sum

indicated therein is credited to the account, on which basis the said auditors report

was prepared. Nevertheless, the computation of interest on the said basis was

wrong. This is because the statement shows that there was a credit balance but the

bank statement did not show whether the cheques were cleared or uncleared.

Hence there was a deficit between the actual balance and the available balance of

the account. Hence the computation of interest on the basis of amounts shown in

the statement of account was on a wrong basis.

9

In the circumstances, it is clear from the Respondent’s own pleadings

and the evidence led at the trial that the Respondent has failed to prove his case, as

set out in the said amended plaint, on balance of probability.

The Respondent contended that his case was not prescribed in law

since the demand had been made by the said letter dated 25.11.1999 (P 14) and

therefore the prescriptive period of the action was to commence from 25.11.1999.

The learned counsel for the Respondent submitted on the said basis that the

Respondent had demanded the said amount by the said letter dated 25.11.1999 and

the Appellant, by a letter dated 23.12.1999, (P 15), had denied the liability for the

claim, and that has given rise to the cause of action and hence the action has been

instituted well within the period of three years.

As I mentioned above by the said letter dated 25.11.1999 (P 14), the

Respondent had demanded only a sum of Rs 1,874,392.76. Although the demand

was such, the Respondent has not instituted the instant action to recover the said

sum of money as demanded by P 14. The Respondent without filing the action on

the said demand, has opted to institute the said action to recover a sum of Rs

2,880,004.50 according to his aforementioned 1st demand made by the letter dated

16.08.1997 (P 7). Accordingly, the period of prescription of the instant action had

begun to run from the said date of P 7, i. e. 16.08.1997 and not from the date of P

14, i. e. 25.11.1999.

Although the original plaint bears the date 17.10.2000, the

Respondent has filed the action in the District Court of Colombo on 20.10.2000.

Thereafter the Respondent has filed an amended plaint dated 28.09.2001. It is

crystal clear that since the demand P 7 had been made on 16.08.1997, the

10

Respondent has failed to institute the action within 03 years from the said date.

Hence the Respondent’s said three causes of action were prescribed in law.

The learned President Counsel for the Appellant submitted that in

instituting an action of this nature, no demand is necessary, as the date of accrual

of the cause of action would be the date of each wrongful debit, and not from the

date of demand. Since, I have reached the conclusion that the Respondent’s action

was prescribed in law on the demand itself, it is not necessary to consider the said

submissions at this stage.

In the said circumstances, I set aside the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge dated 29.03.2007 and the judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal dated 11.06.2010. The Respondent’s action instituted in the District

Court of Colombo is dismissed. The appeal of the Appellant is allowed with costs

in all courts.

Appeal allowed.
