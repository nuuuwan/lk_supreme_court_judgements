The Petitioner by this petition seeks a declaration that his fundamental

rights guaranteed by Article 12 and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated

by the 1st to 11th Respondents. This court by its order dated 7.7.2016, granted leave

to proceed for the alleged violation Article 12 and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution by

3

the 1st to 11th Respondents .

The Petitioner submits that pursuant to an advertisement published in a

newspaper for the post of Director Finance of the Land Reform Commission

(LRC), he submitted an application to the LRC for the said post; that after an

interview, he was informed by letter dated 6.4.2016 (signed by the 2nd Respondent)

that he would be appointed to the post of Director Finance of the LRC with effect

from 15.5.2016; that he tendered letter of resignation to his earlier company as he

got the said letter; that he informed the Chairman LRC (2nd Respondent) that he

would accept the appointment; that the letter of appointment dated 22.4.2016 (P8)

to the post of Director Finance with effect from 15.5.2016 was issued to him; that

by letter dated 27.4.2016 (P9) he informed the 2nd Respondent that he would accept

the appointment stated in P8; that on or about 5.5.2016 he received a letter dated

28.4.2016 marked P10 from the 2nd Respondent stating that his aforementioned

appointment to the post of Director Finance had been temporarily suspended until

further notice; that the letter marked P10 has not disclosed any reasons for the

suspension of the said appointment; that he has not received any further

communication from the Respondents regarding the above suspension; that he is in

dire situation with regard to his employment having already given his resignation

from his place of employment; and that his fundamental rights guaranteed by

Article 12 and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated.

The 2nd Respondent, the Chairman of the LRC, in his affidavit filed in this

court, states that the Petitioner was selected to the post of Director Finance as he

was the best amongst the candidates who were present for the interview; that the

letter marked P10 was sent to the Petitioner by the 1st the Respondent Commission

(LRC); that the 1st Respondent received a letter sent by the Petitioner marked P9;

that the reason for sending the letter marked P10 was the order received by the 1st

Respondent by letter dated 22.4.2016 marked 1R3 from the Secretary to the

Ministry of Lands to suspend all proceedings regarding the appointment of

4

Director Finance until proper investigation would be held.

The contention of learned counsel for the 1st to 11th Respondents (Dr.Sunil

Cooray) was that the Minister had issued a directive to the Secretary to the

Ministry of Lands to conduct an investigation/inquiry with regard to the

appointment of Director Finance and as such the Secretary to the Ministry of

Lands issued the letter marked 1R3 suspending all proceedings regarding the

appointment of Director Finance. Dr.Cooray further submitted that the Minister

has the power to do so under Section 47(1) and 47 (3) of the Land Reform Law;

that the Minister should have been made a party; that the Minister is a necessary

party; and that the petition should be dismissed as the necessary is not before court.

I now advert to this contention. Has the Minister issued a directive to the Secretary

to the Ministry of Lands to conduct an investigation/inquiry with regard to the

appointment of Director Finance? On this question the 2nd Respondent relies on the

document marked 1R3 which was signed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands.

But the letter marked 1R3 does not refer to the appointment Director Finance. It

refers to the appointment of an Accountant. Therefore it cannot be said that the

Minister had issued a directive to the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands to conduct

an investigation/inquiry with regard to the appointment of Director Finance.

Further in my view, the 2nd Respondent has no authority to suspend the

appointment of Director Finance acting under 1R3 since it refers to the

appointment of an Accountant. It has to be noted here that the Petitioner’s

appointment is with regard to the Director Finance. I would further like to observe

the following matters. According to 1R3 which is a letter signed by the Secretary

to the Ministry of Lands, the 2nd Respondent has received it (1R3) on 22.4.2016.

When the 2nd Respondent issued the letter dated 28.4.2016 marked P10, the 2nd

Respondent had not referred to 1R3.

When I consider all the above matters, I am unable to agree with the

contention of Dr. Sunil Cooray.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows. “All persons are equal

before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.”

Article 14(1) (g) of the Constitution reads as follows. “Every citizen is

entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any

lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise.”

It appears from the above facts that the Petitioner has resigned from his

employment in his earlier company since he was appointed to the post of Director

Finance in the LRC. When I consider all the matters set out above, I hold that the

letter issued on 28.4.2016 by the 2nd Respondent marked P10 temporarily

suspending the appointment of the Petitioner to the post of Director Finance is

illegal and violates Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution and that therefore

it cannot be permitted to stand.

For the above reasons, I hold that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have

violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12 and

14(1)(g) of the Constitution. There is no strong evidence before court that the 3rd to

11th Respondents have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.

For the aforementioned reasons, I declare that the said letter dated 28.4.2016

issued by the 2nd Respondent marked P10 to the Petitioner is null and void and

direct the 1st Respondent, the 2nd Respondent (the present holder of the office of the

Chairman LRC) and the present members of the LRC to appoint the Petitioner to

the post of Director Finance of the LRC on the same terms and conditions stated in

the letter of appointment dated 22.4.2016 issued to the Petitioner marked P8. I

further direct the 1st Respondent, the 2nd Respondent (the present holder of the

office of the Chairman LRC) and present members of the LRC to implement the

letter of appointment issued to the Petitioner dated 22.4.2016 marked P8. They are

further directed to implement the directions given in this judgment within one

month from the date of this judgment. I do not make an order regarding

compensation since I have ordered the implementation of P8. Considering all the

6

circumstances of this case, I do not order costs.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a certified of this judgment to all the

respondents.
