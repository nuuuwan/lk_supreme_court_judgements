The Petitioner-Respondents in this case filed case No. CA (Writ) 362/2015 in

the Court of Appeal challenging the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent-Appellant) to show the authority

5

under which she claims to hold office as a Member of Parliament. The Petitioner-

Respondents by their petition filed in the Court of Appeal moved inter alia the

following reliefs.

1. Issue a mandate in the nature of Quo Warranto requiring the1st Respondent-

Appellant to show by what authority she claims to hold office as a Member

of Parliament [vide paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition].

2. Issue a mandate in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that the 1st

Respondent-Appellant is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus

not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.

The Court of Appeal by its judgment dated 3.5.2017, issued a writ of Quo

Warranto declaring that the 1st Respondent-Appellant is disqualified to be a

Member of Parliament and that she is not entitled to hold the office of Member of

Parliament. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, the 1st

Respondent-Appellant has appealed to this court. This court on 15.5.2017 by its

majority decision granted leave to appeal on questions of law stated in paragraphs

26(a) to (n) of the petition of appeal filed on 9.5.2017 which are set out below.

a) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in deciding that Article

91(1)(d)(13) of the Constitution operated to prevent the Petitioner from being qualified as a member of Parliament and/or to sit and vote in Parliament;

b) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in deciding that the

Petitioner was a citizen of Switzerland when she was elected to Parliament and/or during the pendency of the application in the Court of Appeal contrary to prevailing Law; c) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

apprehend and/or consider and/or appreciate the application of Swiss law to the citizenship status of the Petitioner;

6

d) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in deciding that the Court

of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the aforesaid matter; e) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

consider and/or appreciate that the relief prayed in the Petition could not be granted on account of the powers, immunities and privileges enjoyed by Parliament and/or Parliamentarians; f) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

consider and/or appreciate that Parliament is the sole judge of its composition; g) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

consider and/or appreciate that the Court has no jurisdiction in respect of the composition of Parliament otherwise than as provided statutorily by Parliament; h) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

consider and/or appreciate that the writ of quo warranto does not lie in respect of a member of Parliament; i) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to sufficiently

consider and/or appreciate that the discretionary remedy of a mandate in the nature of a writ of quo warranto required the dismissal of the application on account of the availability of alternate constitutional and statutory remedies; j) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider

and/or appreciate that the discretionary remedy of a mandate in the nature of a writ of quo warranto required the dismissal of the application on account of the unenforceability of the relief prayed for; k) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider

and/or appreciate that the discretionary remedy of a mandate in the nature of

7

a writ of quo warranto required the dismissal of the application on account of non-joinder of necessary parties; l) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider

and/or appreciate that the discretionary remedy of a mandate in the nature of a writ of quo warranto required the dismissal of the application on account of laches; m) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider

and/or appreciate that the discretionary remedy of a mandate in the nature of a writ of quo warranto required the dismissal of the application on account of non-joinder of necessary parties;

n) Did not their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in deciding that the

Petitioner was a citizen of This is an incomplete question

This Court by majority decision stayed the operation of the judgment of the

Court of Appeal dated 3.5.2017 until final determination of this case.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant contended

that the 1st Respondent-Appellant had sent document marked X1 to Swiss

Authorities in Switzerland and document marked X2 to the Ambassador,

Switzerland Embassy in Colombo. But these letters have been produced in this

court from the custody of the 1st Respondent-Appellant. Were these letters in fact

sent to the Swiss Authorities? They were not produced in the Court of Appeal.

They do not form Part of the Court of Appeal record. This court is invited to

examine the legality and correctness of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The

Court of Appeal was not given an opportunity to examine these documents.

Considering all the above matters, I refuse to consider these documents marked X1

and X2.

8

One of the important questions that must be decided in this case is whether

the 1st Respondent-Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe) was holding dual

citizenship on the day of the Parliamentary Election which was on 17.8.2015. I

now advert to this question. The 1st Respondent-Respondent, the Controller

General of Immigration and Emigration, in his affidavit filed in the Court of

Appeal, states that 1st Respondent-Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe)

was granted dual citizenship (Sri Lanka and Switzerland) on 29.8.2006 and dual

citizenship certificate No.17096 was issued to her. The 1st Respondent-Appellant

too in her written submission filed in this court on 14.7.2017 admits that she got

married to a citizen of Switzerland and by virtue of the said marriage, she was

granted citizenship of Switzerland by operation of law. It is important to note that

the 1st Respondent-Appellant had submitted to the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration, the 1st Respondent-Respondent a letter dated

11.9.2015 alleged to have been issued by Switzerland Authorities. This letter

which has been addressed to the 1st Respondent-Appellant has been produced by

the 1st Respondent-Respondent with his objection marked R2. The said letter states

that 1st Respondent-Appellant had, on 25.8.2015, sent a request to Switzerland

Authorities requesting that she be released from Switzerland citizenship. The said

letter states that she has been released from Switzerland citizenship, but the same

letter suggests that her release from the Switzerland citizenship has not been made

absolute. The date of this letter is 11.9.2015.

As I pointed out earlier 1st Respondent-Appellant in her written submission

filed in this court has admitted that she has been granted citizenship in Switzerland

by virtue of her marriage to Switzerland citizen. Learned President‟s Counsel for

the 1st Respondent-Appellant tried to contend that the 1st Respondent-Appellant has

now given up the Switzerland citizenship. But has she, in fact, given up the

9

Switzerland citizenship? If so when did she do it? If she says that she has given up

Switzerland citizenship she should state the date on which she gave it up because

the Petitioner-Respondents in their petition state that she is a Switzerland citizen.

The Petitioner-Respondents by producing current passport details of the 1st

Respondent-Appellant marked P7 has proved the fact that there is an endorsement

in her passport to the effect that she is a dual citizen. The 1st Respondent-Appellant

too in her written submission filed in this court admits that she was a citizen of

Switzerland. She is now trying to contend that she has given up the citizenship of

Switzerland. Under these circumstances the burden shifts to the 1st Respondent-

Appellant to prove the date on which she gave up citizenship of Switzerland. This

view is supported by Sections 101, 103 and 106 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

“Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent

on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a

person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies

on that person.”

Section 103 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

“The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to

believe in its existence, unless it is proved by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie

on any particular person”

Illustration to this section is as follows:

“B wishes the court to believe that, at the time in question, he was

elsewhere. He must prove it.”

Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

“When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving

that fact is upon him.”

Illustration to this section reads as follows:

10

“A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket. The burden of proving that he

had a ticket is on him.”

The 1st Respondent-Appellant is the best person to speak about the date on

which she gave up the citizenship of Switzerland more than anybody. She even in

her statement of objection and her affidavit filed in the Court of Appeal, does not

state the date on which she gave up the citizenship of Switzerland. She has, by her

letter dated 30.10.2015 marked R1 and produced by the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration, requested the said Controller to issue her a

Diplomatic Passport and not to state in the Diplomatic Passport that she is a dual

citizen as she has got herself released from the dual citizenship. But even in the

said letter she does not state the date on which she ceased to be a Switzerland

citizen. When the above matters are considered, her claim that she does not hold

dual citizenship is very doubtful. It is significant to note that the Petitioner-

Respondents state, in paragraph 11 of their petition filed in the Court of Appeal,

that she is a dual citizen and produced the current passport details of the 1st

Respondent-Appellant marked as P7. It has to be stressed here that her passport

details marked P7 was produced by the Petitioner-Respondents and not by her.

According to this document her current passport which is an official passport

expires on 15.9.2017. The signature, photograph, date of birth, and the address of

the passport holder appear in the said document marked P7. She has, in her

statement of objections and the affidavit dated 10.2.2016 filed in the Court of

Appeal, denied paragraph 11of the petition. Meaning of this denial is that she has

even denied her personal details. Can such denial be accepted?

Although she tried to rely on R2, the letter purported to have been issued by

Switzerland Authorities, to prove that she has been released from Switzerland

citizenship, paragraph 4 of the said letter raises a question whether she has been

11

released absolutely. When she was questioned about this matter in a letter

addressed to her dated 2.11.2015 marked R5 by the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration, she has not replied according to the Controller

General of Immigration and Emigration. The document marked P7 indicates that

there is an endorsement in her passport to the effect that she is a dual citizen. This

evidence is available in the copy of her passport (P7) produced by the Petitioner-

Respondents. Expiry date of her passport according to P7 is 15.9.2017. The case

was filed in the Court of Appeal on 16.9.2015. The 1st Respondent-Appellant filed

her statement of objection in the Court of Appeal on 10.2.2016. If the 1st

Respondent-Appellant claims that she has got herself released from Switzerland

citizenship she should have submitted her passport to the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration requesting him to make an endorsement nullifying her

previous endorsement relating to dual citizen. Has she done it? If she has done it,

this endorsement nullifying the previous endorsement should be available in her

passport. But she has not produced a copy of her passport to court. In these

circumstances, it was incumbent upon her to produce a copy of her passport to

court especially in view of the fact that Petitioner-Respondents have, along with

their petition, produced her passport details marked P7 which carries an

endorsement that she is a dual citizen. In these circumstances, court can apply

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance which reads as follows: “The court may

presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced, be

unfavourable to the person who withholds it.” The1st Respondent-Appellant who

should have her passport in her possession did not produce a copy of her passport

in court and withheld it from court. Therefore, the court can presume that she (the

1st Respondent-Appellant) did not produce a copy of her passport as the production

of the same in court would be unfavourable to her and further court can presume

12

that her passport carries an endorsement to the effect that she is a dual citizen. In

fact her passport details marked as P7 establishes the fact that there is such an

endorsement in her passport. As I pointed out earlier, the letter marked R2 states

that she has been released from Switzerland citizenship, but the same letter

suggests that her release from the Switzerland citizenship has not been made

absolute. The date of this letter is 11.9.2015. When all the above matters are

considered, it is clear that she has not got any release from Switzerland citizenship

prior to 11.9.2015.Thus it is clear that even on 1.9.2015 ( the day of taking oaths as

a Member of Parliament)she was a citizen of Switzerland.

The letter marked R2 states that 1st Respondent-Appellant had, on 25.8.2015,

sent a request to Switzerland Authorities requesting that she be released from

Switzerland citizenship. It is clear from the contents of the letter (marked R2) that

on 25.8.2015 the 1st Respondent-Appellant was a citizen of Switzerland. The

Parliamentary Election was held on 17.8.2015. I again state here that the letter

marked R2 was submitted to the Controller General of Immigration and

Emigration by the 1st Respondent-Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe)

and this letter was annexed to the affidavit of the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration marked R2. The Court of Appeal by its order dated

28.9.2015, had directed the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration to

produce all the documents relating to the citizenship status of the 1st Respondent-

Appellant. It appears that the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration in

compliance with the said directions has produced the documents marked R1 to R5.

It has to be stressed here that the document marked R2 states that 1st Respondent-

Appellant had made a request on 25.8.2015 to release her from Switzerland

citizenship. When contents of the document marked R2 are considered, it can be

concluded that she (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe) had admitted that she has

13

not given up her Switzerland citizenship even on 25.8.2015. It is clear from the

above letter (R2) that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was holding a dual citizenship

(Switzerland and Sri Lanka) when she was elected as a Member of Parliament on

17.8.2015 (the day of the Parliamentary Election). Was the 1st Respondent-

Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe) qualified to be elected as a Member

of Parliament on 17.8.2015 when she was holding dual citizenship (Switzerland

and Sri Lanka)? To find an answer to this question it is important to consider

Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the Constitution). Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the

Constitution reads as follows.

“No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to

sit and vote in Parliament if he is a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any

other country.”

What is the day on which a candidate becomes elected to be a Member of

Parliament? It is the day of the Parliamentary Election. What is the day on which a

candidate becomes qualified to sit and vote in Parliament? It is the day of taking

oaths as a Member of Parliament and thereafter. When I consider the Article

91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliamentary

Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country

1. on the day of the Parliamentary Election or

2. on the day of taking oaths as a Member of Parliament

he cannot be considered as a Member of Parliament and that the office of such

person as a Member of Parliament is a nullity. I further hold that after taking oaths

as a Member of Parliament, if he becomes a citizen of any other country or

continues to be a citizen of any other country, he too cannot be considered as a

14

Member of Parliament and that the office of such person as a Member of

Parliament is a nullity.

I have earlier pointed out that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was holding a dual

citizenship (Switzerland and Sri Lanka) when she was elected as a Member of

Parliament on 17.8.2015. Considering Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution, I

hold that a person who is holding a dual citizenship on the day of the Parliamentary

Election was not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament and office of

such person as a Member of Parliament is a nullity. In the present case, 1st

Respondent-Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe) was holding a dual

citizenship (Switzerland and Sri Lanka) on the day of the Parliamentary Election

(17.8.2015). Considering all the above matters, I hold that the 1st Respondent-

Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe) was not qualified to be elected as a

Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015; that she being elected as a Member of

Parliament is a nullity; that she was not qualified to take oaths as a Member of

Parliament on 1.9.2015; that therefore she could not hold the office of Member of

Parliament; that she cannot be considered as a Member of Parliament; and that her

office as a Member of Parliament is a nullity.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant tried to

contend that Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act applies to the 1st Respondent-

Appellant. I now advert to this contention. I have earlier held that the 1st

Respondent-Appellant could not be considered as a Member of Parliament and that

her office as a Member of Parliament is a nullity. If she cannot be considered as a

Member of Parliament and her office as a Member of Parliament is a nullity,

Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act does not apply to her. Learned President‟s

Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant further contended that Article 140 of the

Constitution should be invoked subject to Article 67 of the Constitution. He

15

advanced this contention since Article 140 of the Constitution contains the words

„subject to Constitution‟. Article 67 of the Constitution reads as follows.‟

“The privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members may be

determined and regulated by Parliament by law and until so determined and regulated, the

provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, shall, mutatis mutandies,

apply”

I have earlier held that the 1st Respondent-Appellant could not be considered as

a Member of Parliament. If she cannot be considered as a Member of Parliament,

the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act does not apply to her. If the Parliament

(Powers and Privileges) Act does not apply to her, she cannot invoke Article 67 of

the Constitution. For the above reasons, I reject the above contention of learned

President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant next contended

that conferring of Switzerland citizenship was an involuntary act and that she had

not applied for the citizenship of Switzerland and that citizenship of Switzerland

was given to her by operation of law in Switzerland. He further contended that a

woman automatically obtains citizenship of Switzerland upon marrying a Swiss

national and that since the 1st Respondent-Appellant married a Swiss national, she

automatically got the citizenship of Switzerland. He further contended that the 1st

Respondent-Appellant should not be unseated from the Parliament as conferring of

Switzerland citizenship was not given on an application made by her. He also cited

a judgment of Australian High Court to support his contention. In Sykes Vs Cleary

and Others [1992] 176 CLR 77 decided on 25.11.1992 (a copy was produced in

open court by learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant) in

paragraph 52, Australian High Court made the following observation.

“But there is no reason why section 44(i) should be read as if it were

intended to give unqualified effect to the rule of international law. To do so

16

might well result in the disqualifications in Australian citizens on whom there

was imposed involuntarily by operation of foreign law a continuing foreign

nationality, notwithstanding that they had taken reasonable steps to renounce

that foreign nationality. It would be wrong to interpret constitutional

provisions in such a way as to disbar an Australian citizen who had taken all

reasonable steps to divest himself or herself of any conflicting allegiance”

(emphasis added).

In the present case has the 1st Respondent-Appellant taken all reasonable steps to

renounce her Switzerland citizenship? The answer is in the negative. She has only

written a letter. There is no evidence to prove that she has even paid State fee

amounting CHF 100 (100 Swiss Francs) stated in the letter marked R2. Therefore,

the above judicial decision has no application to present case. In any event I must

state here that it is not necessary for me to consider the said judicial decision of the

Australian High Court when our Constitution is very clear on the question in hand.

Be that as it may, the contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st

Respondent-Appellant is that since the 1st Respondent-Appellant married a Swiss

national she automatically got the citizenship of Switzerland by operation of

Switzerland law and that she did not make any application to get the citizenship of

Switzerland and that it was an involuntary act. Has the 1st Respondent-Appellant

taken up this position in his statement of objection and affidavit filed in the Court

of Appeal? The answer is in the negative. How does the Court of Appeal know that

she got married to a Swiss gentleman? The1st Respondent-Appellant has not

produced any material to prove the above facts. The answer to the above question

is in the negative. Although learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-

Appellant contended so, the 1st Respondent-Appellant in her statement of objection

and the affidavit (dated 10.2.2016) filed in the Court of Appeal does not state that

17

she is a dual citizen of Switzerland and Sri Lanka and that she got married to a

Swiss gentleman. In fact, in her statement of objections and the affidavit filed in

the Court of Appeal, she has stated that she is not a dual citizen (paragraph 5). The

fact that she got married to a Swiss national and she automatically got citizenship

of Switzerland has been stated in the written submission dated 14.7.2017 and her

affidavit filed in this court. The stand she has taken up in her affidavit and the

statement of objections filed in the Court Appeal is different from the stand that

she has taken up in the said written submissions. For all the aforementioned

reasons, I reject the above contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st

Respondent-Appellant. There is another ground to reject the above contention of

learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant. I would like to state

here that I have earlier held that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was not qualified to

be elected as a Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015 (day of the Parliamentary

election). Whether conferring of citizenship of Switzerland is voluntary or

involuntary, on the day of the Parliamentary election the 1st Respondent-Appellant

was disqualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament. Considering the above

matters, I reject the contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st

Respondent-Appellant.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant next contended

that the Court Appeal did not have jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of the

Constitution to hear this case as 1st Respondent-Appellant taking oaths as a

Member of Parliament amounts to proceedings in Parliament. He heavily relied

upon the judgment of this court in the case of Attorney General Vs Shirani

Bandaranayake SC Appeal 67/2013 decided on 21.2.2014 (hereinafter referred to

as Shirani Bandaranayake‟s case). In Shirani Bandaranayake‟s case, there was a

decision of Parliament to appoint a select committee to look into the conduct of

18

Shirani Bandaranayake who was the Chief Justice of the country at that time and

the select committee appointed by Parliament took a decision. The decision of the

select committee was challenged in the Court of Appeal. Thus it is very clear in

that case that what was challenged in the Court of Appeal was the proceedings in

Parliament. In the present case the Petitioner-Respondents challenged in the Court

of Appeal the authority under which the 1st Respondent-Appellant claimed to hold

the office as a Member of Parliament. The Petitioner-Respondents have taken up

the position that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and

Switzerland and that she was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament in terms of

Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution. The Petitioner-Respondents in this case

challenged the election of the 1st Respondent-Appellant as a Member of

Parliament. I have earlier held that the 1st Respondent-Appellant, in terms of

Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution, was not qualified to be elected as a

Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015 and that she was disqualified to take oaths as

a Member of Parliament. When I consider the above matters, I am unable to agree

with the above contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-

Appellant and reject the said contention.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant next

contended that a writ of quo warranto would not lie against a Member of

Parliament. What is quo warranto? Quo warranto is a remedy available to call upon

a person who is holding a public office to show the authority under which he

claims to hold the office. This view is supported by the following legal literature.

In the book titled „Constitutional Law and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka

(Ceylon)‟ by JAL Cooray at page 364 the learned Author says as follows:

“Under the law the writ of quo warranto may be granted by the Supreme

Court to determine whether the holder of a public office is legally entitled to

19

it.”…. In Sri Lanka in the absence of any procedure under the Local

Authorities Elections Ordinance writ of quo warranto lies to question the

election of a member of a local government authority who has acted in that

office.” At page 365 the learned Author states as follows: “Even if the

validity of an election cannot be questioned by a quo warranto, the writ is

nevertheless available for the purpose of calling upon a person who is prima

facie disqualified from holding a particular office to show upon what

authority he claims to hold such office.”

In the book titled „Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka‟ by

Sunil F A Cooray at page 445 the learned Author says as follows:

“If the office in question is a „public office‟, for quo warranto to be

available it must be shown that the election/appointment of the de facto

holder of it is a nullity. On the question whether the election/appointment is

a nullity, the relevant facts and the applicable law must be considered in

each case. The election/appointment may be a nullity for different reasons,

namely, absence of a necessary qualification for the office, presence of a

disqualification for the office, incorrect procedure adopted for the

election/appointment, or the wrong person or body has held or conducted

the election or made the appointment.”

In Dilan Perera Vs Rajitha Senaratne [2000] 2 SLR 79 at page 100 Justice

Yapa observed as follows:

“It is to be observed that quo warranto is a remedy available to call upon a

person to show by what authority he claims to hold such office. Therefore,

the basic purpose of the writ is to determine whether the holder of a public

office is legally entitled to that office. If a person is disqualified by law to

hold statutory office the writ is available to oust him.”

20

Having considered the above legal literature, I hold that writ of quo warranto is

a remedy available to call upon a person to show the authority under which he

holds the public office and that if the holder of the public office is not legally

entitled to hold the public office, court has the power to grant a writ of quo

warranto to oust him.

Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution clearly states that no person shall be

qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament if

he is a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country. The election

that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was elected as a Member of Parliament was held

on 17.8.2015 and she took oaths as a Member of Parliament on 1.9.2015. I have

earlier held that the 1st Respondent-Appellant was not qualified to be elected as a

Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015; that therefore she could not hold the office of

Member of Parliament; that she could not be considered as a Member of

Parliament; and that she being elected as a Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015 is a

nullity. According to the aforementioned legal literature, writ of quo warranto is

available to oust her from the office of Member of Parliament. Therefore, the

contention that writ of quo warranto would not lie against a Member of Parliament

lacks merit. For the above reasons, I reject the contention of learned President‟s

Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant drawing our

attention to provisions of Parliamentary Election Act No 1of 1981 next contended

that the only way that 1st Respondent-Appellant could have been removed from the

office of Member of Parliament by filing an election petition under the provisions

of Parliamentary Election Act No 1of 1981 and that Article 140 of the Constitution

could not be invoked to remove a Member of Parliament. He contended that an

election petition must be filed within 21 days from the date of election and such an

21

election petition has to be filed by two sets of people described in Section 95 of

Parliamentary Election Act No 1of 1981. He contended that removal of Members

of Parliament could not be done as and when people choose to do so. If the

contention of learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant is

accepted as correct, then Article 140 of the Constitution cannot be invoked and the

provisions of Parliamentary Election Act No 1of 1981 would oust the jurisdiction

conferred to Superior Courts by Article 140 of the Constitution. Article 140 of the

Constitution reads as follows:

“Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have full power

and authority to inspect and examine the records of any court of First Instance or tribunal

or other institution and grant and issue, according to law, orders in the nature of writs of

certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the judge of

any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution or any other person.”

Learned President‟s Counsel for the 1st Respondent-Appellant submitted that

Article 140 of the Constitution should be exercised subject to the law. He advanced

this contention since Article 140 of the Constitution contains the word „law‟. Does

the Article 140 of the Constitution state that the Court of Appeal shall have power

subject to the provisions of Law? No it does not say so. If any Article of the

Constitution states that it must be used subject to any provisions of law then the

contention that such an Article must be used subject to the law can be successful.

Are there such provisions in the Constitution? For the purpose of clarity I would

like to refer to Article 138(1) of the Constitution which reads as follows.

“The Court of appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the Constitution

or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or law which

shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction

or by any Court of First Instance, tribunal other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision or restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

22

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal

other institution may have taken cognizance;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of

the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.”

The above Article states that the Court of appeal shall have power to

exercise appellate jurisdiction subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of

any law. But Article 140 of the Constitution does not state contain the words

„subject to provisions of any law.‟ The Article 140 of the Constitution states that

„subject to the provisions of the Constitution the Court of Appeal shall have full

power and authority‟. Therefore, can the contention that Article 140 of the

Constitution should be invoked subject to the provisions of Parliamentary Election

Act No 1of 1981 be accepted? In other words can the Article 140 of the

Constitution be ousted by ordinary legislation? In finding an answer to this

question it is necessary to consider certain judicial decisions.

In Sirisena Cooray Vs Tissa Dias Bandaranayake [1999] 1SLR page 1 this

court held as follows:

“The writ jurisdiction of the Superior Courts is conferred by Article 140 of

the Constitution. It cannot be restricted by the provisions of ordinary

legislation contained in the ouster clauses enacted in sections 9(2) and 18A

of the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Law or section 2 of the

Interpretation Ordinance.”

In Atapattu and Others Vs Peoples Bank [1997] 1 SLR 208 page 208 at

page 222 This Court held as follows:

“Apart from any other consideration, if it became necessary to decide

which was to prevail - an ouster clause in an ordinary law or a

23

Constitutional provision conferring writ jurisdiction on a Superior

Court, "subject to the provisions of the Constitution”- I would

unhesitatingly hold that the latter prevails, because the presumption

must always be in favour of a jurisdiction which enhances the

protection of the Rule of Law, and against an ouster clause which

tends to undermine it. But no such presumption is needed, because it

is clear that the phrase "subject to the provisions of the Constitution”

was necessary to avoid conflicts between Article 140 and other

Constitutional provisions - such as Article 80(3), 120, 124, 125, and

126(3), That phrase refers only to contrary provisions in the

Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written

laws, which are kept alive by Article 168(1)”

In Moosajees Limited Vs Arthur and Others [2006] 1SLR 65 this court observed

the following facts:

“The 1st respondent tenant applied to the 2nd respondent (Commissioner for

National Housing) under section 13 of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law,

No. 1 of 1973 (“CHP Law”) to purchase the house in dispute owned by the

appellant. On 25.01.1984 the Commissioner refused the application holding the

premises were business premises under section 47 of the CHP Law. On appeal to

the Board of Review under section 39(1) of the Law, the Board held that it was a

house as it had been used for residence from 1943. The Court of Appeal refused an

application by the appellant to quash the decision of the Board by certiorari. The

Court held that in view of section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance, read with

section 39(3) of the CHP Law, the court‟s jurisdiction was ousted as the decision

24

of the Board using the test of user was not ex facie outside the Board‟s jurisdiction

and by its order dated 09.02.2001, refused the application for a writ.” This court

held as follows:

“In the above circumstances, the decision of the Board of Review was ultra vires and a

nullity-outside its jurisdiction and the appellant was entitled to a writ of certiorari

notwithstanding section 39(3) of the CHP Law. Further, Article 140 of the Constitution

prevailed over section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance. For that reason also, section 39(3)

of the CHP Law had no application.”

Article 140 of the Constitution is a constitutional provision. Constitution is

the Supreme Law of the country. Considering all the above matters, I hold that the

ordinary legislation cannot oust the powers conferred to the Superior Courts under

Article 140 of the Constitution. When I consider the aforementioned legal

literature and the above observation, the contention of learned President‟s Counsel

for the 1st Respondent-Appellant that the only way to remove a Member of

Parliament was by filing an election petition and that Article 140 of the

Constitution cannot be invoked to remove a Member of Parliament cannot be

accepted and is hereby rejected.

Considering all the above matters, I hold that the 1st Respondent-Appellant

was disqualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015 and that

she is not entitled to hold the office of Member of Parliament. In view of the

conclusion reached above, the questions of law stated in paragraphs 26 (a) to 26(j)

are answered as follows: The Court of Appeal did not make any error in its

judgment dated 3.5.2017. The questions of law set out in paragraphs 26(k) to

26(m) do not arise for consideration. Paragraph 26(n) is incomplete. I have earlier

held that that the 1st Respondent-Appellant (Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe)

was not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament on 17.8.2015; that the

1st Respondent-Appellant being elected as a Member of Parliament is a nullity; that

25

she was not qualified to take oaths as a Member of Parliament on 1.9.2015; that

therefore she could not hold the office of Member of Parliament; and that she

cannot be considered as a Member of Parliament; that her office as a Member of

Parliament is a nullity; and that writ of quo warranto is available to oust her from

the office of Member of Parliament.

In view of all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Court of Appeal

was correct when it issued a writ of quo warranto declaring that the 1st Respondent-

Appellant was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and that she is not

entitled to hold the office of Member of Parliament. For the above reasons, I affirm

the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal of the 1st Respondent-

Appellant with costs. In view of the conclusion reached above, the stay order

issued by majority decision of the court comes to an end.
