It was further submitted that the purpose of the application for commission is to get the corpus surveyed and identified by supper imposing of the Surveyor General\u2019s title plan No. 128908.

    "text": "The learned counsel submitted that Surveyors reports marked P9 and P12 in respect of the said commissioners plans, although they state that boundaries and the lands were shown to court commissioners by the parties to the action, the plans 715 and 691A depict two different lands by their metes and bounds. The aforesaid contradictory identifications of the corpus on ground, demonstrate that the parties concerned were unable to identify the corpus to be partitioned as a land in existence and found on the ground. The deed of partition marked 6V10 has been executed and relied upon by the 6th Defendant- Defendant for his title was made on the partition plan No. 1144 made on 17.02.1980 by A.E. Wijesuriya, licensed surveyor marked 6V9. This plan was made sixteen years prior to the institution of the action. The two plans made by court commissions Nos. 715 and 691A by reference to the said partition plan No. 1144 identify and acknowledge that they were made out of different parts of the land partitioned and claimed by the 6th Defendant- Respondent and his brother who was his witness at the trial. In plan 715 the South Eastern boundary and in Plan No. 691A the North Eastern and South Eastern boundaries by reference to the land of the 6th Defendant -Respondent W.D. Dayananda by name and that the lands shown marked lot 1 are part and parcel of a land owned by the 6th Respondent by deeds 6V 10 and 6V 11 and depicted in the said plan 1144 as lot \u2018B\u2019. The learned Counsel submitted that the absence of permanent boundaries on the North East and South East of the portion of land claimed as the corpus by the Appellants as depicted in plan 691A and bounded by parts of the lands claimed by W.D.W. Dayananda the 6th \u2013Defendant-Respondent leads to the necessary conclusion that the land surveyed as the corpus is a part of the land depicted in plan No.1144 owned by the 6th Defendant-Respondent. Conclusions. The main question that has to be decided is whether the corpus was properly identified or not. It is the burden of the parties seeking to partition the land to establish the identity of the land on balance of probability. The Appellants relied on Surveyor General\u2019s Plan No. 128908 dated 14.11.1983 and the Plan No. 691A dated 24th January 2001 made by K.P.G.P. Krishnapillai, licensed surveyor based on the Surveyor General\u2019s Plan. The plaintiffs did not refer to the Surveyor General\u2019s Plan No. 128908 dated 14.11.1983 in the plaint or in the title deeds. It was not appended to the plaint. This plan was first produced by the first Plaintiff when Wijerathne, licensed surveyor went to the land to survey the land. It is the position of the licensed surveyor Wijerathne that this plan could not be superimposed on the land. This compelled the Plaintiffs to obtain another commission on K.G. Krishnapillai, licensed surveyor who made the plan no 691A making use of the Surveyor General\u2019s Plan No. 128908. There were no boundaries on the ground. He used a pitawella(embankment) as the northern boundary and made a plan according to the shape and extend given in the Surveyor Generals plan and demarcated",
