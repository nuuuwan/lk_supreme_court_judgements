Respondent-Respondent

WRITTEN SUBMISSION ON: 13.07.2015 (the 1st Accused Appellant Appellant)

ARGUED ON : 06.12.2016

DECIDED ON : 01.08.2017

UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The 1st Accused Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court of Matara against the

conviction dated 27.07.2007 and sentence imposed upon the Accused by the

learned Magistrate of Matara dated 07.09.2011. The High Court, by judgement

dated 15.11.2012, has dismissed the said appeal and affirmed the conviction and

the sentence. This appeal lies from the said judgment of the High Court.

According to the minute dated 27.05.2013 this court has directed the

Appellant to file a proper petition of appeal together with all documents on or

before 05.08.2013. But the Appellant has not complied with the said order of this

court.

5

It is significant to note that, in the said petition of appeal to this court,

the Appellant has not sought special leave to appeal from the said impugned

judgment of the learned High Court judge in terms of Section 9 of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No 19 of 1990. Furthermore, it is

important to note that this court has not granted special leave to appeal.

At the hearing, the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that

leave to appeal to this court had been granted by the High Court. But the relevant

proceedings of the High Court manifests that the said submission of the learned

counsel for the Appellant is erroneous. The High Court proceedings dated

22.11.2012, indicates that the Appellant had tendered a petition of appeal and

affidavit to the said High Court. Thereafter the said petition of appeal had been

filed of record and the case record had been submitted to the learned High Court

Judge by the office, seeking a suitable order. The learned High Court Judge had

ordered to forward the case record to this court with the said petition of appeal and

an affidavit filed by the Appellant dated 15.11.2012 and 16.11.2012 respectively,

having a sub file kept at the High Court office. Said proceedings of the High Court

manifests that the learned High Court Judge too, had not dealt with the matter of

granting leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.

This appeal has been preferred against the said convictions and

sentences imposed upon the Appellant and the 2nd to 5th Accused Respondent

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd to 5th Respondents) by the learned

Magistrate of Matara. The Appellant and the 2nd to 5th Respondents in this case

were convicted of committing unlawful assembly and causing simple hurt on two

women named Hokandara Wannage Sirima Kanthi and Pathiranage Renuka

Kumari, offences punishable under Section 140 and Section 314 to be read with

Section 146 of the Penal Code and each of them was sentenced to a term of 03

6

months rigorous imprisonment suspended for 05 years and to pay a fine of Rs.

1500/- carrying a default term of 02 months simple imprisonment.

In convicting the Appellant and the 2nd to 5th Respondents, the learned

Magistrate has analysed the evidence of prosecution witnesses number 01 to 05.

Said witnesses No 1, 2 and 3 were the injured persons at the incident which on

29.05.2005. Medico-Legal Reports of the said injured persons had been produced

marked P1 to P 3. The learned Magistrate had reached the conclusion that said

Medico Legal Reports has corroborated the injuries received by the witnesses No 1

and 2. According to P 1 said Sirima Kanthi had received 03 injuries and W.P.

Renuka had received one injury. The Appellant and the 5th Respondent had given

evidence. The 2nd 3rd and 4th Respondents had remained silent on the dock.

The learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the complainant

has abused the judicial process to charge the Appellant and the 2nd to 5th

Respondents for an offence punishable under Section 140 to be read with section

146 of the Penal Code. According to the evidence of the prosecution the Appellant

and the 2nd to 5th Respondents were present at the time of throwing stones to

injured persons and they had been properly seen and identified by the injured

persons. Soon after the incident a complaint had been lodged at the police station

and the injured persons had been admitted to the hospital. At the investigation, the

police had observed about 10 to 12 pieces of metal fallen in the compound of the

injured persons’ house.

The Appellant and the 2nd to 5th Respondents were not able to create a

reasonable doubt in the said evidence of the prosecution. The learned Magistrate

has correctly analysed and evaluated the evidence led by the prosecution and also

the evidence led for the defence. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned High

Court Judge too, has gone through the said evidence and reached the conclusion

7

that the findings of the learned Magistrate should not be disturbed. In the

circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with such findings of both courts.

The learned Magistrate has imposed on the Appellant and 2nd to 5th

Respondents a term of 03 months rigorous imprisonment suspended for 05 years

and to pay a fine of Rs. 1500/- carrying a default term of 02 months simple

imprisonment.

It must be noted that, for offences under Section 314 and 140 of the

Penal Code, a rigorous imprisonment cannot be imposed on an accused. It should

be a simple imprisonment. Hence, I vary the said term of 03 months rigorous

imprisonment and substitute in place of that a term of 03 months imprisonment

suspended for 05 years. Subject to the said variation in the sentence I dismiss the

appeal of the Appellant without costs.
