Sisira J. De Abrew, J.

This is an appeal by the plaintiff-appellant-petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff-appellant) against the judgment of the

Civil Appellate High Court dated 29.10.2009 wherein the Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court affirmed the judgment of the learned District Judge.

The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 25.04.2012, held in

favour of the 1st defendant-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 1st defendant). Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court, the plaintiff-appellant has appealed to this Court. This Court

by its order dated 8.12.2010 granted leave to appeal on the questions of law

set out in paragraphs 9(b), (c) and (d) of the petition dated 23.03.2010 which

are set out below –

4

b) Have the learned District Judge and the learned High Court Judge

erred in deciding that the deed P2 is one which is executed as a mere

trust and that it is not a legally valid document which transfers

beneficial interest of property unto the Petitioner thus wrongfully

analysing the law of trust as opposed to the law of ownership of

property?

c) Based on 8 (b) above have the learned Judges of the District Court

and the High Court wrongly analysed and misinterpreted section 83 of

the Trust Ordinance and section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance.

d) Have the learned judges failed to analyse the evidence which leads to

the conclusion that all ingredients constituting the concept of the law

on ownership of property has been established by the Petitioner in his

evidence thus entitling him to the reliefs prayed for in the plaint?

The facts of this case may be briefly summarised as follows:-

The original owner of the property in suit was Maria Fernando

and after her death, the 1st defendant Anesta Malani Fernando became the

owner. The 1st defendant by Deed No.18580 dated 12.09.1995, transferred

the property to Harold Appuhamy on a consideration of Rs.50,000/-.

Thereafter, Harold Appuhamy and the 1st defendant on 10.10.1995, by Deed

No.626 dated 10.10.1995 attested by Dilrukshi Fernando, Notary Public

(P2), transferred the property in suit to the plaintiff-appellant. On the same

day (10.10.1995) the plaintiff-appellant by Deed No.627 dated 10.10.1995

5

attested by Dilrukshi Fernando, Notary Public leased the property in suit to

the 1st defendant for a period of one year. The 2nd defendant-respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd defendant) is the husband of

the 1st defendant. Since the 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant failed to

handover the vacant possession of the property is suit, the plaintiff-

appellant filed this action in the District Court seeking inter alia, a

declaration of title; ejectment of the 1st and the 2nd defendants; and vacant

possession of the property in suit.

The 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant filed answer denying

the claims of the plaintiff-appellant. The position of the 1st defendant and

the 2nd defendant was that the 1st defendant did not, by Deed No.18580,

transferred the beneficial interests to Harold Appuhamy; that it was only a

monitory transaction; that she (the 1st defendant) obtained Rs.50,000/- from

Harold Appuhamy with an oral agreement that Harold Appuhamy would

retransfer the property once the amount of Rs.50,000/- is repaid; that it was

not an outright transfer; that Harold Appuhamy wanted back Rs.50,000/-;

that 1st defendant had to seek Rs.50,000/- in order to repay the loan

obtained from Harold Appuhamy; that the property in suit was transferred

to the plaintiff-appellant by Deed No.626 and obtained Rs.50,000/- from the

plaintiff-appellant; that the amount of Rs.50,000/- was paid back to Harold

Appuhamy; that the property in suit was kept on security; that she (the 1st

defendant) never transferred the beneficial interests of the property to the

plaintiff-appellant.

6

Learned President’s Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant referring

to the issue No.12 submitted that the answer given by the learned District

Judge to the said issue was wrong. Issue No.12 was to the effect that the

agreement at the time of execution of Deed No.18580 between the 1st

defendant and Harold Appuhamy was that Harold Appuhamy would be

retransfer the property in suit to the 1st defendant once the amount of

Rs.50,000/- with interest is paid back. The learned District Judge has

answered the issue in the following language: ‘‘There has been an agreement

to retransfer the property’’. Learned President’s Counsel for the plaintiff-

appellant submitted that the said agreement was contrary to Section 2 of

the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and invalid. Learned President’s

Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant relying on Section 91 and 92 of the

Evidence Ordinance contended that no oral evidence could be led to

contravene what is stated on the face of Deed No.626. He has taken up this

contention in paragraph 34 of his written submissions. I now advert to this

contention. He relied on the judicial decision in the case of Perera vs.

Fernando 17 NLR 486 where it was held that -

‘‘where a person transferred a land to another by a Notarial deed

purporting on the face of it to sell the land, it is not open to the

transferor to prove by oral evidence that the transaction was in

reality a mortgage and that the transferee agreed to re-convey the

property on payment of money advanced.”

Learned President’s Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant also relied on the

judgment in the case of Serimuttu vs. Thangavelanthan 55 NLR 529 where

the Privy Council held that in formal agreement relied on by A amounted not

7

to a trust but to a contract for the transfer of immovable property and was

therefore invalid as it contravened the provisions of Section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance.

In considering the contention of the learned President’s

Counsel, it is necessary to consider Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance which

reads as follows:-

"Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot

reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he

intended to dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee

must hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative."

As stated by Dr. L.T.M. Cooray in his book on Trust (page 129)

the pivotal words in the Section are ‘‘intended to dispose of the beneficial

interest in the property’’.

If the principle set out in the above legal literature is to be followed how can

an owner of the property in a case under Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance

prove that he did not intend to dispose of the beneficial interest in the

property?

In order to prove the legal principle discussed in Section 83 of the Trust

Ordinance, it is necessary to lead oral evidence between the vendor and the

vendee at the time of the Deed of Transfer was executed. If evidence relating

to attendant circumstances that the vendor did not intend to transfer the

beneficial interest is shut out, then the purpose of Section 83 of the Trust

8

Ordinance will be rendered nugatory. In this connection I would like to

consider the judicial decision in Muttammah vs. Thyagarajah 62 NLR 559.

The facts as set out in the headnote of the said judgment are as follows:-

In September1941, P. who was entitled to the entirety of a land, donated.

to T. his son, an undivided half-share of the property. In October 1954, T

donated the same half-share back to his father P to enable him, the more

easily, to raise a loan of Rs. 20,000 on a mortgage of the entire land. No

reservation was made: in To favour in the deed of gift of 19-54, but by

parolevidence T proved interalia that he continued to remain in possession

of his share of the land and 'that: it was expressly understood between the

parties that the share should be reconvened to after payment of the

mortgage debt. The loan of Rs. 20,000 was never raised, and P died in

March 1956. In the present action instituted by T against the executrix de

son tort of F's estate, T claimed that the defendant held the half-share in

trust for him.

It was held that the plaintiff was entitled under section 83 of the Trusts

Ordinance to lead parol evidence of " attendant circumstances" at or about

the time of the execution of the deed showing that although T transferred

his half-share to P in 1954 by what was in form an absolute conveyance it

was the intention of the parties that T should retain the beneficial interest

in the property and that what was conveyed was only the nominal

ownership to P.

G.P.S. de Silva CJ in the case of Premawathi vs. Gnanawathi [1994] 2 SLR

171following the judicial decision in Muttammah vs. Thyagarajah (Supra)

held as follows:-

9

“An undertaking to reconvey the property sold was by way of a

non-notarial document which is of no force or avail in law under section

2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. However the attendant

circumstances must be looked into as the plaintiff had been willing to

transfer the property on receipt of Rs. 6000/- within six months but

could not do so despite the tender of Rs. 6000/- within the six months

as she was in hospital, and the possession of the land had remained

with the 1st defendant and the land itself was worth Rs. 15,000/-, the

attendant circumstances point to a constructive trust within the

meaning of section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance. The "attendant

circumstances" show that the 1st defendant did not intend to dispose of

the beneficial interest.”

In Dayawathi and Others vs. Gunaskera and Another [1991] 1SLR 115

the facts set out in the headnote are as follows:-

The Plaintiff bought the property in suit in 1955. He started

construction work in 1959 and completed in 1961. The Plaintiff, a

building contractor, needed finances in 1966 and sought the assistance

of the 2nd defendant with whom he had transactions earlier. This

culminated in a Deed of Transfer in favour of the 1st Defendant, who is

the mother of the 2nd Defendant and the 2nd Defendant being a

witness to the Deed. The property was to be re-transferred within 3

years if Rs. 17,000/- was paid. The Plaintiff defaulted, in his action to

10

recover the property, the Plaintiff succeeded in the trial Court in

establishing a constructive trust. The Court of Appeal reversed the

judgment on the sole ground that the agreement was a pure and simple

agreement to re-transfer.”

His lordship Justice Dheeraratne in the above case held as follows:

“(i) The Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance do not bar parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and

that the transferor did not intend to pass the beneficial interest in the

property.

(ii) Extrinsic evidence to prove attendant circumstances can properly be

received in evidence to prove a resulting trust.”

I am in respectful agreement with a view expressed by His Lordship

Justice Dheeraratne. After considering the above legal literature, I would

like to follow the principle laid down in the case of Dayawathi and Others

Vs. Gunasekera and Another (Supra) and I hold that Section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance

do not operate as a bar to lead parole evidence to prove a constructive trust

and to prove that the transferor did not intend to dispose of beneficial

interest in the property.

11

For the above reasons I reject the above contention of learned

President’s Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant.

It was the contention of the plaintiff-appellant before us that

Deed No.626 dated 10.10.1995 was an outright transfer and the plaintiff-

appellant by virtue of the said deed has become the rightful owner of the

property in suit.

It was the contention of the defendant-respondents that the 1st

defendant by Deed No.626 did not transfer the beneficial interest of the

property in suit to the plaintiff-appellant and that the plaintiff-appellant

held the paper title of the property subject to a constructive trust in favour

of the 1st defendant. Therefore the most important question that must be

decided in this case is whether the 1st defendant by Deed No.626 has

transferred beneficial interest of the property in suit to the plaintiff-

appellant.

In order to prove the contention of the plaintiff-appellant, he,

among other things, relied on the evidence that is to say that prior to the

execution of Deed No.626, he made an advance payment of Rs.100,000/- to

the 1st defendant. He specifically states that on 20.01.1995 he paid an

advance of Rs.50,000/- to the 1st defendant for the purpose of purchasing

this property. The date of Deed No. 626 is 10.10.1995. Although, he takes

12

up the above position, the Notary Public in her attestation in Deed No.626

does not state this fact. The Notary Public Dilrukshi Fernando in her

attestation states that an amount of Rs.50,000/-which was the

consideration of the deed was paid in her presence. The plaintiff-appellant

was specifically questioned as to why he did not tell the Notary Public that

he had paid Rs.100,000/- to the 1st defendant. He failed to give an answer

to this question (vide 78 of the brief). When the above evidence is

considered, his evidence that he paid Rs.100,000/- as an advance payment

to the 1st defendant prior to the execution of Deed No.626 cannot be

accepted and no reliance can be placed on his evidence.

The Deed No.626 was executed on 10.10.1995. The plaintiff-

appellant, in his evidence at page 69 of the brief, states that even after the

execution of Deed No.626 on 11.10.1995, he paid Rs.100,000/- to the 1st

defendant. If the Deed No.626 was an outright transfer, there is no

obligation on the part of the plaintiff-appellant to pay further sum of money.

Thus it can be contended that the plaintiff-appellant has not received the

beneficial interest of the property in suit by Deed No.626. During the cross

examination of the 1st defendant the plaintiff-appellant produced promissory

notes marked P9 to P12 (vide page 158 of the brief). The details of P9 to P11

are as follows:--

Promissory Note Date Amount

P9 16.10.1995 Rs.100,000

13

P10 26.12.1995 Rs.52,000

P11 25.03.1996 Rs.40,000

The above details demonstrate that the plaintiff-appellant had

made payments to the 1st defendant after the execution of Deed No.626 (P2)

dated 10.10.1995. The position of the plaintiff-appellant is that by Deed

No.626 (P2) he has received the beneficial interest of the property in suit and

the 1st defendant had transferred the same to him (plaintiff-appellant). If he

has got the full title of the property in suit by Deed No.626 and the 1st

defendant has transferred the beneficial interest to him, why did he make

the above payments to the 1st defendant after the execution of the deed?

The above evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff-appellant indirectly has

admitted that he had not received the beneficial interest of the property in

suit. Thus, from the evidence of the plaintiff-appellant itself conclusion can

be reached that the plaintiff-appellant had not received the beneficial

interest of the property in suit.

On the other hand what does the 1st defendant say on the

promissory notes? She says that the plaintiff-appellant obtained her

signature on empty pro notes as she could not pay the interest on the loan

of Rs.50,000/- that she obtained from the plaintiff-appellant. The above

evidence establishes that the 1st defendant had only obtained a loan and

beneficial interest had not been transferred when the Deed No.626 (P2) was

executed.

14

According to Deed No.626 (P2) Harold Appuhamy transferred

the property to the plaintiff-appellant. For Harold Appuhamy to transfer the

property he should be the owner of the property. But, what does Harold

Appuhamy, in his evidence say on this point? He says that the 1st

defendant requested a loan from him and he granted the loan of

Rs.50,000/- keeping the deed of transfer (Deed No.18580) as a security (vide

pages 185-190 of the brief). Harold Appuhamy, at page 186 of the brief,

specifically states that he did not purchase the property in suit. He further

states, in his evidence, that it was a transaction between the 1st defendant

and him. This evidence clearly shows that Harold Appuhamy has not

become the owner of the property and the 1st defendant had not passed the

beneficial interest of the property in suit to Harold Appuhamy and that he

(Harold Appuhamy) was only holding the property in suit on a constructive

trust on behalf of the 1st defendant. If Harold Appuhamy was not the owner

of the property in suit and he was holding a property on a constructive trust

on behalf of the 1st defendant, the plaintiff-appellant cannot claim that he

became the owner of the property in suit and the beneficial interest was

transferred to him by Deed No.626 (P2). Therefore, the contention of the

plaintiff-appellant that by Deed No.626 (P2) he became the owner of the

property in suit fails. If the plaintiff-appellant did not become the owner of

the property in suit, Deed No.627 (P3) whereby he is alleged to have leased

the property in suit to the 1st defendant becomes an invalid deed.

15

The plaintiff-appellant claims that on 19.12.1996 the 1st

defendant and the 2nd defendant both left the property in suit and they re-

entered the property on 21.12.1996. The plaintiff-appellant has led the

evidence of Grama Sevaka to prove that the 1st defendant and the 2nd

defendant handed over the keys of the house on 19.12.1996 in his presence.

The 1st defendant in his evidence admitted that she handed over the keys of

the house to the Grama Sevaka but came back to the house on the same

date. She vehemently rejected the suggestion that she left the premises.

Her statement made to the police to prove that she had left the house on

19.12.1996 was produced marked P5. She admits that she made a

statement P5 to the police but denies having made the particular statement

that she left the house on 19.12.1996. I have carefully gone through her

evidence and in my view it is difficult to consider that she (1st defendant)

had left the house on 19.12.1996. She says in her evidence that the

plaintiff-appellant on several occasions threatened her to leave the house

but she did not leave.

There is also evidence that she (the 1st defendant) paid

assessment tax to the relevant local authority even after the execution of

Deed No.626; that she continued to occupy the house after the execution of

Deed No.626 (P2); that she paid notary’s fees when Deed No.626 was

executed; that she attempted to get a loan from the State Mortgage Bank to

repay the money obtained from the plaintiff-appellant.

16

Upon a consideration of the totality of evidence led at the trial I

observe the following facts.

1) Harold Appuhamy says in his evidence that he only granted a loan of

Rs.50,000/- to the 1st defendant and he did not purchase the land.

From his evidence it is clear that he only kept the Deed No.18580 as a

security; that the 1st defendant did not pass the beneficial interest of

the land in suit to Harold Appuhamy; and that Harold Appuhamy held

the property in suit on a constructive trust on behalf of the 1st

defendant. Therefore, Harold Appuhamy by Deed No.626 could not

have transferred the beneficial interest of the property in suit to the

plaintiff-appellant.

2) The 1st defendant continued to occupy the property in suit after the

execution of Deed No.626 dated 10.10.1995.

3) The plaintiff-appellant gave money even after the Deed No.626 (P2)

was executed to the 1st defendant.

4) The plaintiff-appellant got the signature of the 1st defendant on empty

promissory notes when the 1st defendant could not pay the interest on

the money given by the plaintiff-appellant. This shows that the

plaintiff-appellant had granted a loan to the 1st defendant keeping the

property in suit as a security.

5) The plaintiff-appellant admitted in evidence that the value of the

property in suit in January 1995 was Rs.340,000/-. Valuation report

submitted by Joseph indicates that the value of the property in March

17

1996 was Rs.750,000/- (vide Joseph’s evidence at pages 191-197)

The consideration of the Deed No.626 dated 10.10.1995 was only

Rs.50,000/-.

6) Valentine Appuhamy on the request of the 1st defendant made an

application to the State Mortgage Bank with the consent of the

plaintiff-appellant to get a loan in respect of the property in suit to

repay the loan obtained from the plaintiff-appellant. The plaintiff-

appellant in fact gave a copy of the relevant deed to Valentine

Appuhamy. The bank approved a loan of Rs.350,000/-. But later the

plaintiff-appellant withdrew his consent that he gave to obtain the

loan. Therefore, the loan of Rs.350,000/- could not be obtained from

the bank.

When I consider the entire evidence led at the trial and

submissions of both parties, I am of the opinion that the 1st defendant by

Deed No.18580 and/or Deed No.626 have not transferred the beneficial

interest of the property in suit to the plaintiff-appellant and that the

plaintiff-appellant is holding the property in suit on a constructive trust on

behalf of the 1st defendant and that the plaintiff-appellant cannot be

granted the relief asked for in his plaint and that more reliance can be

placed on the case of the 1st and the 2nd defendants. I therefore hold that

there are no reasons to disturb the judgments of the District Court and the

Civil Appellate High Court. In view of the conclusion reached above, I

answer the questions of law raised by the plaintiff-appellant in the negative.

18

For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that there is no merit in

the appeal of the plaintiff-appellant, I affirm the judgments of the District

Court and the Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss this appeal with costs.

The Learned District Judge in his judgment had granted 8

weeks’ time from the date of his judgment to the 1st defendant to pay

Rs.80,000/- and its interest to the plaintiff-appellant. This date should be

read as the date that the learned District Judge pronounces the judgment of

this Court in the District Court. However, the learned District Judge has a

discretion to extend the above time period.

Appeal dismissed.
