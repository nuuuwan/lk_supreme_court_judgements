----- K. SRIPAVAN, C.J.,

When this Application was taken up for support, Learned the President’s Counsel

appearing for the 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th and 15th Respondents raised the following two

Preliminary Objections to the maintainability of this Application.

(i) The Petitioner’s Application and/or the reliefs sought are out of time

in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution; and

(ii) The Petitioner has failed to comply with Rule 44(1)(b) of Part IV of the

Supreme Court Rules of 1990.

The Petitioner by his Petition dated 16.08.2015 instituted this Application in the best

interests of the public, having regard, inter alia, to Article 28(f) of the Constitution

and in order to benefit the public and most significantly, the environment.

(emphasis added). At paragraph 35 of the Petition, the Petitioner states as follows:-

“The Petitioner was most shocked and surprised when he became aware on

17.07.2015 that the 1st Respondent had purportedly decided on or about

28.05.2015, to, inter alia,

(a) issue annual permits to the 10th to 15th Respondents in respect of

Victoria Reservoir reservation lands; (emphasis added)

(b) introduce additional conditions in such permits issued to the 10th to 15th

Respondents with regard to the effecting of additional constructions on

the said lands;

(c) take action against all other persons who had effected constructions

within the said 100 Metre reservation of the Victoria Reservoir,

(d) take action to cancel annual permits issued to 127 other persons who had

(allegedly) not effected any constructions on the said reservation lands,

ad provide them with alternate Mahaweli lands“

4

At Paragraph 36 of the Petition, the Petitioner claims that no lawful basis, grounds or

reasons are contained in the said purported “Memo” in order for the Respondent

Board to justify the alienation of such reservation lands to the 10th to 15th

Respondents on permits. The Petitioner further alleges that the said six parcels of

the land alienated to the 10th to 15th Respondents admittedly located within 100

Metres from the full supply level of the Victoria Reservoir.

The Directive Principles of State Policy emphasize the dignity of the individual and

the worth of the human person by obliging the State to take various measures for

the purpose of securing and protecting the environment. Preservation of the

environment and keeping the ecological balance unaffected is a task which is not

only an obligation of the successive Governments but also every citizen must

undertake as a social obligation. The word “environment” is of broad spectrum

which brings within its ambit “ a hygienic atmosphere and ecological balance”. It is

therefore not only the duty of the State but also the duty of every citizen to maintain

hygienic environment. Hygienic environment is an integral facet of a right to healthy

life and it would be impossible to live with human dignity without a humane and

healthy environment. Therefore, there is a constitutional imperative on the State

and its agencies not only to ensure and safeguard proper environment but also an

imperative duty to take adequate measures to promote, protect and improve the

natural environment.

I would like to emphasize the following observations made by Sathasivam, J. in U.P.

Pollution Control Board Vs. Bhupendra Kumar Mody (2009) 2 SCC 147 -

“ ….. Courts cannot afford to deal lightly with cases involving pollution of air

and water. The message must go to all concerned persons whether small or

big that the Courts will share the Parliamentary concern and legislative

interest of the Act to check the escalating pollution level and restore the

balance of our environment. Those who discharge noxious polluting effluents

into streams, rivers or any other water bodies which inflicts detriment on the

public health at large should be dealt with strictly de hors to the technical

objections.”

The Fundamental Rights referred to in Chapter III of our Constitution should be

interpreted in the light of the Directive Principles of State Policy and the

fundamental duties referred to in Article 28. By defining the constitutional goals, the

Directive Principles and fundamental duties set forth the standards or norms of

reasonableness which must guide and animate governmental action.

If no one can maintain an action for redress of a public wrong or public injury, it

would be disastrous to the rule of law for it would be open to the State or a public

authority to act with impunity beyond the scope of its power or in breach of a public

duty owed by it. The strict rule of standing which insists that only a person who had

suffered a specific legal injury can maintain an action for judicial redress is relaxed

and a broad rule evolved which gives standing to any member of the public who is

not a mere busy body or a meddlesome interloper but who has sufficient interest in

the proceeding. There can be no doubt that the risk of legal action against the State

or its agencies by any citizen will induce the State or its agencies to act with greater

responsibility and care thereby improving the administration of justice. In any event,

the Court observes that the Petitioner has filed this application on 17.08.2015 which

is within one month of his becoming aware of the document marked P7 only on

17.07.2015 as averred in paragraph 35 of the Petition. Hence, the Court cannot

conclude that this Petition has been filed outside the time limit prescribed by Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

Learned President’s Counsel of the Petitioner strongly contended that the

Petitioners own document marked X, namely, the case record in S.C. F.R. 495 /2008

shows that the annual permits marked P22(a) and P22(b) were issued on

08.11.2005, and the Petitioner instituted S.C. F.R. Application 495/2008 on

24.10.2008. Thus, at least, as at 24.10.2008 that the Petitioner was aware of the

said permits that were issued to the 10th to 15th Respondents. Ratnayake, J. in the

course of the judgment in S.C. F.R. 495/2008 (2010) 1 S.L.R. 1 at page 21 noted as

follows:

“……..it is clear that the alienation of the lands and the granting of permission

to construct houses in the lands which are the subject matter of this

6

application have been done in violation of the applicable laws and regulations

in an arbitrary manner by the 1st Respondent Authority thereby violating

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Due to the above reasons, I hold the 1st Respondent Authority has violated

Article 12(1) of the Constitution by (i) alienation and (ii) granting of

permission to construct houses in respect of the lands which are the subject

matter of this application.”

The Judges of the apex Court cannot shut their eyes to injustice, otherwise, the apex

Courts would not be able to perform the high and noble role which it was intended

to perform according to the faith of the Constitution. The Court cannot permit a

repetition of a wrong action by the 1st Respondent Authority after the judgment was

delivered in 2010. For the reasons set forth above, I overrule the first Preliminary

Objection.

The Second Preliminary Objection of the Learned President’s Counsel for the 10th,

11th, 12, 13th, 14th and 15th Respondents was that the Petitioner has failed to comply

with Rule 44(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 as the Petitioner has failed to

name the Respondents in compliance with the Rules.

Rule 44(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 provides as follows :-

“Where any person applies to the Supreme Court by a Petition in writing,

under and in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, for relief and redress

in respect of an infringement or imminent infringement, of any fundamental

right or language right by executive or administrative action he shall :

(b) name as respondents the Attorney General and the person or persons who

have infringed or are about to infringe, such right;

It must be noted that in terms of Article 126(4) of the Constitution, the Supreme

Court has the power to grant such relief or make such directions as it may deemed

just and equitable in respect of any Petition. This Court in Jayanetti Vs. Land Reform

7

Commission (1984) 2 S.L.R. 172 at 179 noted that “Any procedural rules must be

considered secondary to the constitutional guarantees” and observed as follows:-

“This is an extensive jurisdiction and it carries with it all implied powers that

are necessary to give effect and expression to our jurisdiction. We would

include within our jurisdiction, inter alia, the power to make interim orders

and to add persons without whose presence questions in issue cannot be

completely and effectually decided. In fact, our present decision is in no way

widens the ambit of Article 126 but seeks to articulate its real scope and make

the remedy more effective.”

Thus , the Court cannot dismiss the application merely because the Petitioner has

failed to name the Respondents. The Court directs the Petitioner to include the

names of the Officers who hold the Offices of the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth

Respondents within a period of two weeks from today in order to consider the

application further.

The Registrar is directed to fix a date in consultation with all Counsel for

consideration of Leave to Proceed, once the caption is amended as aforesaid.

CHIEF JUSTICE

NALIN PERERA, J.

I agree.
