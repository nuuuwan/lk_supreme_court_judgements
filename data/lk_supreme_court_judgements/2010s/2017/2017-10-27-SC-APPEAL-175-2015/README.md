DECIDED ON: 27.10.2017 GOONERATNE J. The Plaintiff-Appellant-Petitioner is the Bank of Ceylon. This was an

action filed in the District Court of Ratnapura by the Bank of Ceylon based on a

temporary over draft facility granted to the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent

(Aswedduma Tea Manufactures (Pvt) Ltd – Tea Company) to recover a sum of

Rs. 4,818,582/52 with interest at 26% per annum from 22.08.1999.

Plaintiff-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff)

had been engaged with the banking business with the Defendant-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as Defendant) for some time and the

Defendant maintained current account bearing No. 000310209724 in the

Ratnapura Super Grade Branch of the Bank. Plaintiff Bank granted over draft

facilities to the Defendant and the Defendant by letter marked P1 dated

21.11.1998 requested for a temporary over draft facility in a sum of Rs. 4.5

million for a period of three months and the said sum was paid from time to

time by the bank to the Defendant. The Defendant submitted several cheques

and withdrew money which was not repaid to the Plaintiff bank. As the

Defendant defaulted in settling the dues the Plaintiff Bank filed action. Parties

4

proceeded to trial on 5 admissions and 17 issues. However the District Court

dismissed the action on the following main grounds.

(a) There was no written contract between parties to grant over draft

facilities, nor were the cheques presented to the Bank by the Defendant,

produced at the trial.

(b) In the absence of clear evidence to prove that the statement of accounts

marked P3 – P13, the fact that the Plaintiff Bank paid money to the

Defendant by way of over drawing the account was not proved.

The Civil Appellate High Court affirmed the Judgment of the learned

District Judge and set aside the portion of the District Court Judgment pertaining

to prescription. Supreme Court on 12.10.2015 granted Leave to Appeal on

questions of law referred to in paragraph 17 (1 – 15) of the Petition of Appeal.

The journal entry of the said date indicates that the Senior State Counsel was

permitted to select specific questions of law. Respondent party was absent and

unrepresented. Accordingly the Senior State Counsel had selected 6 questions

of law. This court having looked at the questions, is in a position to answer same

to cover the position relied upon by the District Court and the Civil Appellate

High Court.

The 1st question of law states as follows:

(1) Did their Lordships of the High Court of Civil Appeal misdirect

themselves and err in law by misconstruing ‘issue No. 1’ stating that

the Appellate Bank had essentially presented a case on a written

5

agreement? Issue No. 1 raised in the original court was whether

Plaintiff Bank provided over draft facilities. I agree with the

submissions of learned Senior State Counsel that this issue does not

involve a written contract at all. It merely suggest that the Bank

entered into a contract with the Defendant to grant over draft

facilities. As such the High Court has erred in law and fact, by

concluding that the District Court cannot be faulted for demanding the

presentations of a written agreement in relation to the over draft

facilities, since the Appellant’s case was not based on the existence of

a written contract.

(2) The 2nd question of law is whether the Judges of the Civil Appellate

Court erred in law and act contrary to the weight of the evidence, by

failing to hold that a legally binding agreement arose between the

parties for the provision an overdraft facility by the Appellant Bank to

the Respondent.

The important aspect of this case is that over draft facilities results

in an existence of an oral or unwritten agreement between parties. Presenting

a written agreement is not essential.

It is well established that, from a legal point of view, an over draft

is a loan granted by the bank to the customer. When an account is overdrawn,

the customer becomes the debtor and the Bank, the creditor. A point is made

that a bank is obliged to let its customer overdraw only if it has contractually

undertaken to do so. This would not mean only a written contract. The High

6

Court has erred in considering the basic tenants of the law of contracts. The

formation of a contract depends an offer and acceptance. There is a meeting of

minds. P1 document by the Defendant is a written requests for overdraft facility

(TOD). Document P2 and P15 are Bank memorandums which prove that the

customers facility has been approved by the Bank. The Defendant made a

written request by P1 which is the offer. P2 & P15 are the acceptance of the

Plaintiff Bank. What more do you need?

Another way to look at this problem is that the cheques offered by

the Defendant would amount to an offer. If there are insufficient funds in the

current A/C the bank could even ignore the cheques and reject payment.

However if the bank honours the payment order of the Defendant by way of

cheques, it will be deemed to have accepted when it executes the customers

payment order, in this case the several cheques.

The position could be further elaborated by the following case law

citied by the learned Senior State Counsel.

Peter Royston Voller V Lloyds Bank Plc No. B3/99/1177 Justice Wells of the Court of Appeal

(Civil division) held that “In my judgment, the position is very simple and well established as

a matter of banking law and practice. It is this. If a current account is opened by a customer

with a bank with no express agreement as to what the over draft facility should be, then, in

circumstances where the customer draws a cheque on the account which causes the account

to go into over draft, the customer, by necessary implication, request the bank to grant the

customer an overdraft of the necessary amount, on its usual terms as to interest and other

charges. In deciding to honor the cheques the bank by implication accepts the officer”.

7

Barclays Bank Ltd V. W.J. Simms son and Cooke (southern) Ltd and another (1977 B. No. 679)

Rober Goff J held that:

“In other circumstances the bank is under no obligation to honour its customer’s cheques. If

however a customer draws a cheque on the bank without funds in his account or agreed over

draft facilities sufficient to meet it, the cheque on presentation constitutes a request to the

bank to provide over draft facilities sufficient to meet the cheque. The bank has an option

whether or not to comply with that request. If it declines to do so, it acts entirely within its

rights and no legal consequences follow as between the bank and its customer. If however

the bank pays the cheque, it accepts the request and the payment has the same legal

consequences as if the payment had been made pursuant to previously agreed over draft

facilities; the payment is made within the bank’s mandate, and in particular the bank is

entitled to debit the customer’s account, and the bank’s payment discharges the customer’s

obligation to the Payee on the cheque”.

Defendant never denied an existence of a contract, except a written

contract. The Civil Appellate Court has failed to appreciate an existence of an

unwritten agreement as observed above.

The 3rd question of law is on estoppel. Defendant is estopped in

denying liability. The Defendant having overdraw the current account and

having benefited from the facility cannot be heard to deny liability.

In Barclays Bank Ltd V. W.J. Simms son and Cooke (southern) Ltd and another (1977 B. No.

679) Rober Goff J held that:

“If a customer draws a cheque when there is insufficient funds in his account and

without making prior arrangements with the bank, the position is that the drawing of the

cheque is a request for overdraft facilities. The bank has no obligation to grant such facilities

or to honour the cheque. It is free to choose. If the bank chooses to pay, this creates an

enforceable obligation against the customer. By these means the banker pays with a

mandate”.

8

The 4th question of law is whether the Judges of the Original Court

misconstrued the best evidence rule?

I do agree with the learned counsel for the Bank that the bank does

not rely on Section 50 of the Civil Procedure Code, which require a litigant who

relies on a document to produce the document or even annex it to the plaint.

This was an arrangement between the Plaintiff Bank and the Respondent. This

being a over draft facility the bank need not annex a document or the several

cheques since there is evidence of the several bank statements placed and

produced before court. These documents i.e the statement of A/c were

produced in court and had been compared by witness No. 2 for the bank with

the relevant ledger. This is not an action based on a cheques but on over draft

facilities. In this regard I note the provisions contained in Section 53 of the Civil

Procedure Code.

In King Vs. Peter Nonis 49 NLR 16

“In any case what is the meaning of “best evidence” in the English law sense? It certainly does

not, and never did, mean that no other direct evidence of the fact in dispute could be

tendered. Its meaning is rather that the best evidence must be given of which the nature of

the case permits. If one were to apply that meaning of the phrase to the present case, it might

be held that the entry in the register ought to have been produced, since it would appear

from the evidence of the first wife herself that the marriage was registered. But the “best

evidence” rule in England has been subjected to a whittling-down process for over a century,

and today it is not true that the best evidence must be given, though its non-production where

available may be a matter for comment and may affect the weight to be attached to the

evidence which is produced in its stead.”

9

I hold that the best evidence is the statement of accounts, which

was compared with the original ledger, by the witness for the Bank.

Question No. 5 reads as “did the learned High Court Judge err in

holding that secondary evidence was produced instead of primary evidence?

Plaintiff Bank’s case is based on over draft facility. It is the position

of the Bank that it need to prove that the account was over drawn. Bank

statements P3 to P13 were produced to court without any objection, when it

was produced. Further witness No. 2 for the Bank fortified the position of the

Bank on statements by giving evidence and comparing P3 – P13 with the original

ledger. Bank statements are in the custody of the A/C holder. As such secondary

evidence could be received in evidence.

If there was a discrepancy in the monthly statement the customer

is required to notify the bank immediately. Defendant Company did not give any

evidence nor did it complain of any fault in A/C etc. In fact the Defendant

benefited but a huge monetary loss had been caused to the bank, by the

Defendant over drawing the account. There cannot be an objection for leading

secondary evidence. Further the statements produced at the trial is permissible

to be led in terms of Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance.

Question No. 6 did the High Court err in failing to take cognisance

of the fact that there was no evidence in denial.

10

Respondent never led evidence to establish their position. Law

permits to draw necessary inferences in the event of the Respondent’s failure

to lead evidence.

Rodrigo Vs. St. Anthony’s Hardware Stores 1995 (1) SLR 7

“The 1st Defendant did not give evidence and the court is entitled to draw the presumption

that had he given evidence; such evidence would have been unfavourable to the case of the

Defendants – see Section 114 illustrations (f) of the Evidence Ordinance”

I wish to observe that both courts had erred in coming to a

conclusion that the original written contract and the several cheques were not

produced. I have already in this Judgment demonstrated that by offer and

acceptance a contract comes into existence. In law there is the express and

implied contracts. Both are recognised in law. In the case in hand the initiative

was taken by the customer by letter P1. (request for O/D facilities in a large

sum). Bank accepted such proposal and went ahead and permitted the

Defendant to overdraw the account. As observed secondary evidence of the

Statements of Accounts were led without any objection. In fact in cross-

examination the learned counsel for the Defendant fortified the position of the

Bank in giving the cheque numbers to the witness and questioned the witness

about the cheques (Folio 69/70 of the brief). Witness willingly answered the

question by saying that Defendant was paid on the cheques. I also note as stated

above that the statements of accounts marked and produced in this case were

11

compared with the original ledger by witness No. 2 for the Bank. Section 90A of

the Evidence Ordinance has made provisions to deal with bank books, ledgers,

statements etc. Courts must consider the proper utilisation of the provisions, in

the Evidence Ordinance.

In all the above circumstances I allow this appeal. Plaintiff-

Appellant-Petitioner would be entitled for relief as per paragraphs d, e, f, g & h

of the prayer to the petition. I also allow sub-paragraph ‘c’ of the prayer to the

petition except that part of the Judgement dealing with prescription; Questions

of law are answered in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellant.

Appeal allowed with costs.
