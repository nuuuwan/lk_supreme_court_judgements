BEFORE : Sisira J. de Abrew, J.

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J. and

Nalin Perera, J.

COUNSEL : M. Kumarasinghe with H.L.D. Nishanthi

instructed by Mrs. J. Kumarasinghe for

the Petitioners.

Yuresha de Silva, SSC. for the

Respondents.

ARGUED & DECIDED ON : 16.05.2017 Sisira J. de Abrew, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective

cases.

Petitioners joined the Inland Revenue Department as

Class III, Grade II Tax Officers in August, 1993. Thereafter, in 2001 they

were promoted to Class III, Grade I as Senior Tax Officers. In February,

2006 interviews were held for the promotion of officers to Class II, Grade

II. For that interview only 134 officers were called and all 134 officers

were selected (including the petitioners) to the said promotion.

Although the said 134 officers were selected for the

said promotion only 122 officers were given the promotion. It has to be

noted here the Petitioners were not given the promotion by the decision

of the Public Service Commission. The decision of the Public Service

SC. FR. No. 180/2016

5

Commission to refuse to grant the approval for the Petitioners is reflected

in 4R7 and 4R9.

Being aggrieved by the decision of the Public Service

Commission not to grant the promotion to the Petitioners, the Petitioners

appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (hereinafter referred to

as the A.A.T.). The A.A.T, by order dated 12th of October 2009, directed

the Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as the P.S.C.) to

grant the promotion to the Petitioners with effect from 02nd of October

2006. It has to be noted here that the other 122 officers were granted

the promotion with effect from 02/10/2006. P.S.C. implemented the

order of the A.A.T. and the Petitioners assumed duties as per the order of

A.A.T. The Petitioners got the promotion with effect from 02nd of October

2006. But later in March, 2016 P.S.C. back dated the date of promotion

of the above mentioned 122 Officers with effect from 22nd of February

2006. After hearing the said order of the P.S.C., the Petitioners too, by

document marked P6 dated 29th of April 2016, appealed to the P.S.C. to

back date their promotion to the same date i.e. 22nd of February 2006.

But the P.S.C. did not respond to their appeal. In effect date of the

promotion of the Petitioners remained as 02nd of October 2006. Their

appeal to the P.S.C. was to back date their promotion to 22nd of February

2006. Since the P.S.C. did not respond to the appeal made by the

Petitioners, Petitioners have come before this Court by way of this

petition.

Petitioners contend that their fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the

members of the P.S.C. since they (members of the P.S.C.) did not back

date their date of promotion to 22nd of February 2006.

SC. FR. No. 180/2016

Reasons given by the P.S.C. not to back date the date

of promotion of the Petitioners to 22nd of February 2006 are found in the

document marked 4R19 dated 15th of July 2016.

When we consider 4R19 it appears that the P.S.C. has

taken up the position that there was no possibility to consider appeals to

amend the date of appointments of the officers appointed on directions

given by the A.A.T. or the Supreme Court.

Although the P.S.C. has stated those reasons in 4R19,

it appears that they have taken somewhat different decision with regard

to some other Officers which is found in 4R20 dated 20/10/2016. The

document marked 4R20 indicates that appointments of 11 Tax Officers

who were appointed on the directions given by the A.A.T. with effect from

02/10/2006 were back dated to 22/02/2006. The question that arises

is as to why the P.S.C. did not apply the same rule to the Petitioners’

appeal.

When we consider all the above facts, we are of the

opinion that the decision of the P.S.C. not to back date the date of

promotion of the Petitioners to 22nd of February 2006 is unreasonable

and is violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. We hold that the

Petitioners have not got the equal protection of law. For the above

reasons, we hold that the members of the P.S.C. (4th -12th Respondents)

have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

We therefore direct the P.S.C. and the members of the

P.S.C. to back date the promotion of the Petitioners to the post of

Assessor Class II Grade II to 22nd of February 2006. When we consider

SC. FR. No. 180/2016

7

the facts of this case, we are of the opinion that we should not order any

costs.

Registrar of this Court is directed to forward a certified

of copy of this judgment to the 4th to 13th Respondents.

The P.S.C. is directed to implement the order of this

Court within one month from today. In giving effect to this order, the

P.S.C. must take steps not to affect the seniority of the Petitioners as it

existed in February 2006.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Nalin Perera, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Ahm
