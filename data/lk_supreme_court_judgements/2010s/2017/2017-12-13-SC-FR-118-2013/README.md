ARGUED ON: 30.11.2017 DECIDED ON: 13.12.2017 GOONERATNE J. The Petitioner in this application was the Director General of the 1st

Respondent Authority. He was appointed to the said post on 11.08.2011. (vide

P4, P5 & P6). In paragraph 8 of the petition it is pleaded that the 1st Respondent

Authority was running at a loss and the Petitioner was responsible for curbing

such a loss and bring it to be a profitable organisation, as he introduced several

progressive changes in the business. As such by letter P7 the 2nd Respondent

allocated further duties to the Petitioner. In this case the main issue, is that the

Petitioner was sent on vacation of post in the manner pleaded in paragraph 9 to

15 of the petition and in the corresponding affidavit. The Supreme Court on

05.10.2013 granted Leave to Proceed in terms of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of

the Constitution.

The Respondents have taken up the following preliminary

objections in their statement of objections.

(1) Petitioner does not disclose an infringement or an imminent infringement

of a fundamental right.

(2) Mala fides of Petitioner

(3) Misrepresentation of material facts

4

(4) Suppression of material facts

(5) Lack of Uberrima Fides

No doubt the Respondents pleadings refer to same but unfortunately

none of the above was substantiated to court on behalf of Respondent in an

acceptable manner. It is also pleaded that the Petitioner whilst discharging his

official duties acted in a harmful and prejudicial manner which is harmful to the

interest of 1st Respondent Authority. It is stated that the Petitioner failed and

neglected to discharge the official duties diligently and as a result of

irresponsible and negligent conduct of the Petitioner an internal panel of inquiry

was held (X1 & annexture to same marked X2). In the objection of the

Respondent at paragraph 13(a) it is pleaded that Petitioner whilst abusing the

power of office wrongfully obtained possession of his personal file and removed

the documents in the file. In the same sub paragraph (e) document X3 is

annexed and pleaded as part and parcel of the paragraph thereof. It is stated X3

is a letter issued on behalf of the 1st Respondent to the Secretary of the Ministry

of Environment and Renewable Energy. Perusal of X3 does not indicate that it

has anything to do with the contents of sub paragraph (e) and that it was

addressed to the said Secretary. X3 is a letter addressed to the Petitioner by the

2nd Respondent regarding absentisam of attendance, by the Petitioner.

Paragraph 14 of the objections refer to voluntarily refraining from reporting for

5

work. In fact the Petitioner has been terminated from service on that account

and nothing else. In this regard X4 a Disciplinary Code (X4) has been submitted

along with the objections.

Our attention was draw to Clause 2:8 and 2:10 of the Disciplinary

Code which deals with notice of absence and vacation of post, due to absence.

According to Clause 2:10 he should have informed the Chairman of his absence.

Petitioner has failed to do so. In this way the Respondents seek to justify the

termination.

Article 14(1)(g) confers on a citizen the right to engage with any

lawful trade, business, occupation or profession subject to the restrictions

contained in Article 15(5) and (7) of the Constitution. Article 23(1) of the

universal declaration of Human Rights provides “everyone has the right to work,

to free choice of employment. This article protects the right to work for a living

which is the very essence of personal freedom”.

The Petitioner assumed duties in the 1st Respondent Authority on

or about 11.08.2011. The 2nd Respondent has by letter marked P7 allocated

certain responsible duties to the Petitioner. That was by January 2013. This is an

indication of the fact that the Petitioner had diligently performed his duties, It

appears to this court that all troubles started for the Petitioner with the matters

highlighted in document P8, wherein the Commission to investigate Bribery or

6

corruption required certain details from the Petitioner regarding a consultant of

the 1st Respondent. Authority called Krish Weerasinghe. This way a request for

details from another important State Agency, which the Petitioner had to

comply within his official capacity. As such the version of the Petitioner

becomes more probable, and there is justification for the Petitioner to act

accordingly. I accept the position that from then onwards the 2nd Respondent

became hostile towards the Petitioner and the Petitioner fell so ill as a result.

This can be so when a head of the organisation is hostile towards the Petitioner

who also hold a responsible position in the 1st Respondent Authority. In this

regard letter P10 sent by the Petitioner to the Secretary of Ministry of

Environment support the Petitioner’s version, which is more probable.

I have also examined all the notes pertaining to Petitioners absence

(P8 (a) to P8 (e). These notes are addressed to Senior Manager called (P &A)

Acting P8 (d) has in fact been submitted to the Chairman 1st Respondent

Authority. All these notes have been acknowledged in the note itself. P9 is a

medical certificate. Leave has been recommended form 22.02.2013 to

01.03.2013. This court has no reason to dispute any of the above. The 2nd

Respondent the then Chairman has acted with Malice where the Petitioner is

concerned. Material made available to court by either party is sufficient to come

to a conclusion that the then Chairman of the 1st Respondent Authority has due

7

to his own reasons which is tainted with malice has taken the step to discontinue

the Petitioner’s employment. This court having weighed the pros and cons of

the case in hand has to make a just and equitable order, and as such need to

intervene in the circumstances of the case. I am convinced with the Petitioner’s

version.

Lord Denning observed that “a man’s right to work at his trade or

profession is just as important to him as, perhaps more important then his right

to property. Just as the courts will intervene to protect his rights to property, so

they will also intervene to protect his right to work” 1966 (1) AER 689 at 694.

In all the circumstances of this case I grant the relief as prayed for

in sub paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition. The petitioner will be

entitled to compensation in a sum of Rs. 400,000/- payable by the 1st

Respondent Authority and cost in a sum of Rs. 100,000/-.

Application allowed with costs.
