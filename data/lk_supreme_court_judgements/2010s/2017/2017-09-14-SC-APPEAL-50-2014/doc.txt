23.4.2015 by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Decided on : 14.09. 2017 Sisira J De Abrew J. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondent filed action in the District Court to recover a sum of

Rs.250,000/- as damages from the Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Defendant-Appellant) on the basis that the Defendant-Appellant

violated the lease agreement entered between the Plaintiff-Respondent and the

Defendant-Appellant. The learned District Judge, by judgment dated 13.11.2000,

held in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment

the Defendant-Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, by

its judgment dated 7.5.2013, dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Defendant-Appellant has appealed to this

court. This Court, by its order dated 27.3.2014, granted leave to appeal on the

questions of law set out in paragraphs 14(a),(b),(c),(d) and (e) of the petition of

appeal dated 17.6.2013 which are set out below.

1. Has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider that there is acceptable

evidence in this case which clearly shows that the Defendant has terminated

the said Lease Agreement (P1) with one (1) calendar month’s notice?

2. Has the Court of Appeal failed to consider that in terms of the provisions of

the said lease Agreement (P1) written notice of termination is not necessary

to validly terminate the said Lease Agreement (P1)?

3. Has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to appreciate that on the facts and

circumstances of this case no damages are payable to the Plaintiff by the

Defendant?

4

4. In any case, has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to appreciate that the

maximum damages payable to the Plaintiff is a sum not exceeding Rupees

Thirty Thousand [Rs.(LKR)30,000/=]?

5. Has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider that a clause permitting

payment of the monthly lease rental in lieu of a calendar month’s notice

need not be expressly stipulated where a calendar month’s notice is

prescribed as a method of terminating that contract, and that no question of

liquidated damages or penalty arises?

The facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows. The Plaintiff-

Respondent leased his vehicle No.32-6273 to the Defendant-Appellant for a period

of two years commencing from 6.7.1995 to 5.7.1997. The monthly rental was

Rs.30,000/- Clause 10 of the lease agreement reads as follows.

“One calendar months notice will be given to either party for handing back

or withdrawal of the vehicle.”

It is therefore seen from the above clause that if the Defendant-Appellant wanted

to give back the vehicle he has to give one months notice to the Plaintiff-

Respondent and if the Plaintiff-Respondent wanted to withdraw the vehicle he too

has to give one months notice to the Defendant-Appellant. The Plaintiff-

Respondent, in his evidence states that on 6.10.1995, when he visited the office of

the Defendant-Appellant, he was requested by the Defendant-Appellant to take

back the vehicle. He claims that the Defendant-Appellant did not give him one

months notice as stipulated in clause 10 of the lease agreement and that therefore

the Defendant-Appellant has violated the lease agreement. The Defendant-

Appellant claims that he, on 4.9.1995, gave one months notice to the Plaintiff-

Respondent over the phone and that the Plaintiff-Respondent took the vehicle from

5

the custody of the Defendant-Appellant on 6.10.1995. He therefore claims that he

had given one months notice as stipulated in clause 10 of the lease agreement.

Samantha Rohan Jayasinghe, the Executive Officer of the Defendant-Appellant’s

company admitted in evidence that the Defendant-Appellant terminated the lease

agreement (page 812 of the brief).

The most important question that must be decided in this case is whether the

Defendant-Appellant terminated the lease agreement as per clause 10 of the lease

agreement. Did the Defendant-Appellant give one month’s notice before handing

back the vehicle? I now advert to these questions. If the Defendant-Appellant gave

one months notice as stipulated in clause 10 of the lease agreement, he should have

raised an issue on this point. It has to be noted here that the Defendant-Appellant

did not raise any issue on this point. Further when the Plaintiff-Respondent gave

evidence, the Defendant-Appellant did not suggest to the witness that he (the

Defendant-Appellant) gave notice over the phone on 4.9.1995. When I consider all

the above matters I hold that the Defendant-Appellant had not given one months

notice to the Plaintiff-Respondent as stated in clause 10 of the lease agreement and

that the Defendant-Appellant had violated the lease agreement.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant contended that even

if the Defendant-Appellant violated the lease agreement, the Plaintiff-Respondent

is only entitled to one month rental (Rs.30,000/-). I now advert to this contention.

Is there any clause in the lease agreement that in the event of the lease agreement

being violated by the Defendant-Appellant, the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled

only to Rs.30,000/-. This question has to be answered in the negative as there is no

such clause in the lease agreement. For the above reasons, I reject the contention of

learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant. When the Defendant-

6

Appellant terminated the lease agreement without notice to the Plaintiff-

Respondent, he would suffer damages. The Plaintiff-Respondent has claimed

Rs.250,000/- as damages. When considering damages it is important to consider a

passage from the book titled ‘The Law of Contracts by CG Weeramanthry Vol. 11

page 925’ which reads as follows.

“The award of damages is based upon the general principle that a sum of

money to be given in reparation of the damages suffered should, as nearly as

possible, be the sum which will put the injured party in the position he would

have enjoyed had he not sustained the wrong for which the award of

damages is made, and that it should include both actual loss and loss of

profit. Damages for breach of contract must, in other words, place the

plaintiff, “so far as money can do it, in the same position as he would have

been in had the contract been performed.”

When a party to a contract violates the contract, the innocent party cannot be

allowed to suffer. The party violated the contract must pay damages to the innocent

party to compensate the loss suffered by him as a result of the violation of the

contract. In such a situation the court has the power to award compensation. I have

elsewhere in this judgment held the Defendant-Appellant had violated the contract.

Considering all these natters I hold that the Defendant-Appellant should pay

compensation to the Plaintiff-Respondent. The Plaintiff-Respondent has claimed

Rs.250,000/-. But he has failed to state any basis for the calculation of the above

amount. When the above amount is considered, it appears that the Plaintiff-

Respondent has not asked for compensation for the entire period of two years.

When the Defendant-Appellant without any notice to the Plaintiff-Respondent

requested him to take back the vehicle it was not possible for him to find a person

7

who would take the vehicle on rent or lease immediately. But it cannot be said that

he would not be able to give the vehicle on rent or lease during the entire period of

two years. In my view, rental for five months (Rs.30,000/-x5= Rs.150,000/-) would

be justified. I therefore hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to

Rs.150,000/-. Subject to the above variation of the amount of compensation, I

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal of the

Defendant-Appellant with costs. The learned District Judge is directed to amend

the decree accordingly. In view of the conclusion reached above I answer the

above questions of law in the negative.
