Later on, the District Court granted an interim injunction on 30.08.2013 preventing the Defendant Respondent from changing the status quo of the property meaning that she should not act in any way renting out, selling or mortgaging the property to any other party. Since the Defendant Respondent was absent on that day and there was no application by her before Court, the Judge had fixed the case for ex parte trial. The Additional District Judge pronounced the judgment granting the substantial relief as prayed for in the Plaint on 01.10.2013. Decree was entered and the Defendant Respondent was given notice of the same. The Defendant Respondent made an application under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code seeking to purge the default. The Plaintiff Appellant objected and the matter was fixed for inquiry. At the end of the inquiry, the District Court delivered Order on 09.05.2014. dismissing the Application to purge the default made by the Defendant Respondent. The Defendant Respondent thereafter filed a \u201c notice of appeal \u201c against the said Order of the District Court dated 09.05.2014. She filed a Petition of Appeal (Final Appeal ) seeking to challenge the said Order. The Plaintiff Appellant submitted to the Civil Appellate High Court, whilst the Appeal was pending to be listed for hearing, by way of a Motion dated 06.02.2015 , seeking that the purported Final Appeal of the Defendant Respondent is liable to be rejected and dismissed in limine, having regard to the matters submitted by way of the said motion. The Plaintiff Appellant submitted to the Civil Appellate High Court, that the correct remedy in seeking to challenge an Order made pursuant to an Application made under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code was by way of an application for Leave to Appeal according to the Judgment of a Divisional Bench in Chettiar Vs Chettiar 2011, BLR 25 and hence, no Final Appeal will lie.

Then the District Judge held an inquiry as provided for by Sec. 86(2) and made order in compliance with Sec. 88(2). The written law in Sec. 88(2) states that \u201c the order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon default shall be accompanied by a judgement adjudicating upon the facts and specifying the grounds upon which it is made, and shall be liable to an appeal to the court of appeal.\u201d Therefore the District Judge\u2019s order refusing to set aside the judgment against the Defendant was accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon the facts pertinent to the default in appearance and the grounds upon which the order was made. It is from this decision of the District Judge that an Appeal to the Court of Appeal lies, according to Sec.88(2). The wording , \u201cshall be liable to an appeal to the court of appeal \u201c is quite clear. There is no ambiguity whether the decision under Sec.88(2) is an interlocutory order or a final order because the section states crystal clear that it is subject to an appeal. It is not an arguable point as it is. Precisely it can be recognized as a final order. A decision made by court after holding an inquiry into purging the default held under Sec. 86(2) does not in any way attract any necessity to decide whether it is an interlocutory order or a final order. Sections 86 and 88 do not refer to any general order to be made. It is a specific decision from which",

The Civil Appellate High Court judges have analysed the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code very carefully and held against the Plaintiff Appellant in this instance. They have quoted the two cases Sangarapillai Vs. Kathiravelu (supra) and Wijenayake Vs. Wijenayake (supra) to support their decision as these sections were gone into in those judgments also. In the case of A.S. Sangarapillai and Brothers Vs Kathiravelu (supra), the Court of Appeal Judge, Siva Selliah has written a long judgment analyzing the Sections 84, 88,753 and 754 and delivered the same on 06.04.1984 holding that \u201c order made under Sec. 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code gives rise to a direct Appeal and not Leave to Appeal. In 1987, the Court of Appeal held in Wijenayake Vs Wijenayake (supra) that \u201c Sec.88(2) states that the order setting aside or refusing to set aside the judgment entered upon default shall be accompanied by a judgment adjudicating upon the facts and specifying the grounds upon which it is made and shall be liable to an appeal to the Supreme Court\u201d. \u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201c The right of appeal is given by the words \u2018 shall be liable to appeal \u2018. Thus one cannot conceive it to be an order to appeal from which leave from the Supreme Court should be first had and obtained as set out in Section 754(2). The remedy sought is therefore misconceived.\u201d There is no merit in the arguments made by the counsel for the Plaintiff Appellants submitting that the Defendant Respondent should have filed a Leave to Appeal Application and not a notice of appeal indicating that a final appeal will be lodged within sixty days. I answer the questions of law aforementioned in the negative against the Plaintiffs Respondents Respondents Appellants and in favour of the Defendant Petitioner Appellant Respondent. I hold that the Civil Appellate High Court had decided the case before them quite correctly on 27th April, 2015 by having rejected the objections taken by the Plaintiff against the maintainability of the Appeal filed before the Civil Appellate High Court and having directed the Registrar of that Court to list the Appeal for argument when the briefs are ready.

    "text": "application in hand. The order approach and the application approach referred to above are relevant only when appeals are filed under Section 754 of the Civil Procedure Code though the learned Counsel for the defendant appellant has argued that this is an application made under Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. Clearly, this is an appeal filed against a judgment made and delivered in terms of Section 85 of the Civil Procedure Code upon a defendant been in default. In such a situation, Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code provides for a special procedure, for the party who is dissatisfied with an order made pursuant to an application filed under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. Moreover, Section 88 (2) clearly sets out the right of appeal given to a party who is dissatisfied with an order made under Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. Such a provision clearly removes any misconception with regard to the appealability of an order under Section 88(2). It ensures that the order made under Section 88(2) shall accompany a judgment by which the rights of the parties had been decided in a conclusive way.",

But Section 88(2) makes it very plain that the order shall be accompanied by a judgment and is an appealable order as distinct from anorder for which leave has to be had and obtained from the Supreme Court. On the mere reading of the two Sections 754(2) and Section 88(2) one has to reject without hesitation the argument that the former repeals the latter\u201d.",
