Samanth Vithana with H. Mendis for the substituted Plaintiff Appellant Respondents S.A.D.S. Suraweera for the 4th, 6th, 14th and 17th Defendant Respondent Respondents WRITTEN SUBMISSION ON: 07.11.2012 by the 26th 27th & 30th Defendant Respondent Appellants. 07.01.2013 by the substituted Plaintiff Appellant Respondents ARGUED ON : 09.08.2016 DECIDED ON : 29.06.2017 UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The original Plaintiff instituted an action in the District Court of

Horana against the Defendant Respondent Respondents seeking to partition a land

called Bomaluwe Godella containing in extent of 02 acres as described in the

schedule to the plaint. 04th and 17th Defendants, 6th Defendant, 7A to 13th

Defendants, 26th 27th and 30th Defendants, 30th Defendant and 43rd Defendant have

filed separate statements of claims seeking to partition the said land as averred in

their statements of claims. Accordingly, the case proceeded to trial on 52 issues. At

the end of the trial, the learned District Judge has dismissed the Plaintiff’s action

without answering the said 52 issues framed by the parties.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 23.09.2004 the

substituted Plaintiff Appellant Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Said appeal was heard and

concluded by the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province holden at

11

Kalutara and the High Court by its judgment dated 23.09.2004 has set aside the

said judgment of the learned District Judge directing him to deliver a fresh

judgment on the evidence already led. In addition, the High Court has concluded

that the District Judge may hear additional evidence if necessary, in order to arrive

at a reasonable conclusion.

The 26th 27th and 30th Defendant Respondent Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellants) sought leave to appeal to this court from the said

judgment of the High Court and leave was granted on the questions of law set out

in paragraph 18(i), (ii), (v) and (vi) of the petition dated 29.02.2012.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was contended before this court that

the High Court has no power upon hearing an appeal to direct the trial judge to

deliver a fresh judgment upon the evidence already led in the case. I first deal with

this question of law raised at the hearing. Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code

deals with the provisions with regard to the powers of the Court of Appeal upon

hearing of an appeal. Section 773 reads thus;

“Upon hearing the appeal, it shall be competent to the Court of

Appeal to affirm, reverse, correct or modify any judgment, decree or

order, according to law, or to pass such judgment, decree or order

therein between and as regards the parties, or to give such direction to

the court below, or to order a new trial or a further hearing upon such

terms as to Court of Appeal shall think fit, or, if need be, to receive

and admit new evidence additional to, or supplementary of, the

evidence already taken in the court of the first instance, touching the

matters at issue in any original cause, suit or action, as justice may

require or to order a new or further trial on the ground of discovery of

fresh evidence subsequent to the trial.”

12

Needless to state here, that Section 773 does not confer any power to

the Appellate Courts, upon hearing of appeal, to order or to direct the trial judge to

write a fresh judgment upon the evidence already led at the trial. The High Court is

only empowered to order a new trial or further hearing as justice may require.

Hence the said order of the High Court, to wit; to write a fresh judgment upon the

evidence already led at the trial, contravenes Section 773 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

The learned counsel for the Appellant further submitted that the

learned District Judge has failed to answer the issues framed by both parties. The

judgment manifests that the issues framed by the parties have not been answered

by the learned District Judge. He has stated in the judgment dated 23.09.2004 that

“since the pedigree has not been proved the land cannot be partitioned. Therefore, I

hold that issues No 1 to 52 do not arise. For the above reasons, I dismiss the

plaint.”

I regret to note that the learned District Judge has blatantly ignored the

provisions contained in Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The paramount

duty of the trial judge as required in law is to answer all the issues accepted by

court. Section 187 of the Code stipulates the requisites of a judgment. In terms of

the said Section, the judgment shall contain a concise statement of the case, the

points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision;

and the opinions of the assessors (if any) shall be prefixed to the judgment and

signed by such assessors respectively.

Hence a trial judge when writing a judgment should safely consider

the points for determination and should record his decision thereon. He should

answer the points of contest after due evaluation of the evidence led before court.

Issues accepted by trial court should not be left unanswered. Trial judge is bound

13

by a legal duty under section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code to deliver a proper

and complete judgment. In the case of Dona Lucihamy v. Ciciliyanahamy 59 NLR

214, L. W. De Silva A.J. observed that “There were 12 issues raised in this case.

Some of them do not bring out the real points of contest. The learned District

Judge has stated in his judgment: ‘All the issues that have been raised can be

crystallized in this one contest’, that is, whether the land in suit is

Dawatagahawatte or Hedawakagahawatte. In the result, the evidence germane to

each issue has not been reviewed or discussed. No reasons precede or follow the

answers which are mostly "yes" or "no" or "does not arise." Such a record has not

disposed of the matters which the Court had to decide. Bare answers to issues or

points of contest whatever may be the name given to them-are insufficient unless

all matters which arise for decision under each head are examined. Section 187 of

the Civil Procedure Code (Cap. 86) is in the following terms "The judgment shall

contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision

thereon, and the reasons for such decision."

In the case of Warnakula Vs. Ramani Jayawardane [1990] 1 SLR 206

it was held that “Bare answers to issues without reasons are not in compliance with

the requirements of s. 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The evidence germane to

each issue must be reviewed or examined. The judge must evaluate and consider

the totality of the evidence. Giving a short summary of the evidence of the parties

and witnesses and stating that he prefers to accept the evidence of one party

without giving reasons are insufficient.”

For the forgoing reasons, I hold that the impugned judgment of the

learned District Judge dated 23.09.2004 contravenes the provisions contained in

Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The failure of the trial judge to examine

14

and to evaluate evidence in order to arrive at a correct conclusion answering the

issues raised at the trial has caused prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties.

In the circumstances, I hold that the High Court is correct in law

concluding that the said judgment of the learned District Judge should stand

dismissed. Also, I hold that the order of the High Court to remit the case back to

the trial court for a delivery of fresh judgment on the evidence already led is bad in

law. Hence, I vary the said judgment of the High Court by setting aside the said

portion, namely; “refer to a fresh judgment by the learned District Judge basing on

the evidence already adduced at the trial.” I order a trial denovo. If the parties are

willing to adopt the evidence already led, the learned District Judge is directed to

adopt the evidence already led and to proceed with the trial from that point

onwards. Parties are at liberty to adduce further evidence if necessary. Subject to

the said variations the appeal is dismissed. I make no order with regard to costs.

Appeal dismissed.
