Accused Appellant Appellant Batagala Dona Dharmarathne Menike (herein after referred to as the

Appellant) was Indicted before the High Court of Kegalle for committing the murder of one

Prasanna Rajapakse by throwing Acid at him on 7th February 2006. After trial before the High

Court Judge without a Jury, the Appellant was convicted of the Indictment and was sentenced to

death. The Appellant appealed against the said conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal,

and the Court of Appeal by its order dated 12.03.2015 set aside the conviction for murder and the

sentence imposed by the High Court and convicted the Appellant for Culpable Homicide not

amounting to murder under section 297 of the Penal Code. Based on the above conviction the

Appellant was imposed a sentence of 15 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/-

and a default term of six months simple imprisonment.

Being dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the Appellant had come before the

Supreme Court by way of Special Leave to Appeal. When this matter was supported for special

leave, after considering the material placed before court, this court had granted special leave on

the following questions of law,

a) Did the Court of Appeal err by sentencing Accused-Appellant-Appellant to 15 years

Rigorous Imprisonment when in fact, on the basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeal

the culpability would have been under the 2nd limb of section 297 of the Penal Code which

relates to “knowledge” carrying a maximum term of 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment

b) Did the Court of Appeal err by failing to address its mind to section 333 (5) of the CCP Act

No 15 of 1979 as to whether a direction should be given considering the period of

incarceration of the Accused-Appellant- Appellant after conviction till the judgment of the

Court of Appeal …… which aspect had in fact being brought to the Notice of the Court of

Appeal

As submitted above the Appellant was convicted of murder by the Learned High Court Judge and

when the Court of Appeal decided to set aside the said conviction and sentence, the Court of

3 Appeal concluded that, “when there is an intention to cause bodily injury likely to cause death

which is in the 2nd clause of section 293 and the injury caused is not necessarily results in death in

the ordinary cause of nature such an act comes within the first part of section 297 of the Penal

Code” and convicted the Appellant for Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder under section

297 of the Penal Code.

When considering the above observation made by the Court of Appeal, in convicting the Appellant

for Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder under the 1st part of section 297 of the Penal

Code it is clear that the Court of Appeal was mindful of the 2nd and 3rd clauses of section 293 and

decided that the circumstances of the case in hand, fit in to clause 2 but not the clause 3.

However our attention was drawn to the following passage of the Court of Appeal Judgment by

the Learned Counsel, who represented the Appellant,

“In answering these questions what this court could apply is the evidence available with

regard to the previous conduct and the subsequent conduct of the Accused-Appellant. The

Accused-Appellant may not have come out with the whole truth in her evidence, but she

has accepted the fact that she threw acid at the deceased. She too had received injuries as

she had not taken any precautions for her protection. Wasantha says that the Accused-

Appellant called him while he was sleeping in his house and said she threw acid at the

deceased and he was lying there, go and see. Any prudent man would not accept that this

series of her acts are acts performed by a person having the intention of killing another.

She may have acted on cumulative provocation, still for all, it cannot be counted as sudden

provocation. But the question here is that whether the Accused-Appellant had the

knowledge that her act would definitely lead to the death of this person. It is evident that

the Accused-Appellant who was a mother of a teenage girl, had been under outrage due to

the feeling that the act of the deceased detrimanted herself respect. Therefore under

those circumstances, the answer of this court to the 3rd question raised above is that the

Accused-Appellant had no knowledge that her act would result definitely in the death of

the deceased.”

and submitted that according to the above observation by the Court of Appeal, the

culpability of the Appellant cannot be under the 1st part but it has to be under the 2nd part to

4 section 297 of the Penal Code which refers to an act done with the knowledge that it is likely to

cause death.

However I cannot agree with the above position taken up on behalf of the Appellant before this

court. As observed by me the position taken up by the Court of Appeal was that the act committed

by the Appellant will not come under clause 1 of section 293 but it does not mean that the said act

will not come under clause 2 of section 293.

When deciding whether the said conclusion by the Court of Appeal had reached correctly, it is

important to consider the circumstances under which the alleged offence took place and the

extent to which the above evidence was considered by the Court of Appeal.

As revealed from the evidence placed before the trial court the Appellant was a married woman

with two children and residing at Gurudeniya in Kegalle. The deceased who had an illicit affair with

the Accused, when her husband, who was a mason, was away from their house, had stopped the

said affair on advice of the others about eight months ago, but had visited the house of the

Accused on the day in question.

According to the evidence of the mother of the deceased, her son had left the house around

8.30 pm informing that he is going to the boutique. The next important item of evidence comes

from the evidence of Chandana who is a neighbor of the Appellant. According to his evidence, on

the day in questioned around 9.00 pm while he was asleep at his house, he heard the Accused

calling for help. When he went towards her house, the Accused told her “uu wrlg weisâ .eyqjd

tyd me;af;a jeá,d bkakjd .sys,a,d n,kak”

The witness got frightened to see what is was and therefore called another neighbor who works in

the police.

However later he got to know that his friend Wasantha’s brother had received injuries and helped

Wasantha to remove the injured to the hospital. This witness along with Wasantha and Tharanga

took the injured to the hospital in a three-wheeler and on their way to the hospital the injured

told them that he went to the house of the Appellant on her request but when he went she

scolded her for spreading some rumours and later threw acid at him.

5 As further observed by this court, the dying deposition made by the deceased, was corroborated

by several other witnesses including the mother of the deceased. According to the evidence of

witness Gunawathy Jayalath who is the mother of the deceased, her son who went to the

boutique around 8.30 pm had returned home around 9.30 pm and told her that, he went to the

Accused’s house since she wanted him to come there, but when he went she scolded him and

threw acid at him. Witness had observed burnt injuries on the body of the deceased and steps

were taken to take the injured to the hospital.

Prosecution in this case had relied on five dying depositions made by the deceased including one

made to the police. As revealed above, the deceased’s version with regard to the incident where

he received injuries is uncontradicted and according to him, the reason for him to visit the

Appellant during that night was due to her invitation, but when he went, the Appellant scolded

him for spreading rumours and threw acid at him.

However as correctly analyzed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Accused was not ready

with the acid in order to throw at the deceased, but had taken it from the adjoining house. After

throwing acid, she had gone to the neighbor, and informed him as to what happened and

requested the neighbor to see what has happened to the injured. In the teeth of the said

evidence, the Court of Appeal had ruled out the possibility of identifying the offence under clause

1 of section 293 of the Penal Code.

When considering whether the act committed by the Appellant comes within clause 2 or 3 of

section 293 and to rule out any possibility under limbs 2, 3 or 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code,

the Court of Appeal was guided by a decision by H.N.G. Fernando CJ in the case of Somapala V.

The Queen 72 New Law Reports 121. As observed by us, the decision in the case of Somapala V.

The Queen had been correctly considered in the present case and the Court of Appeal had sighted

with approval the following passages of the said judgment in their decision;

“The 3rd limb of section 294 postulates one element which is also present in the second

clause of section 293, namely, the element of the intention to cause bodily injury; but

whereas the offence of culpable homicide is committed, as stated in the second clause of

section 293, when there is intention to cause bodily injury likely to cause death, the

offence is one of murder under 3rd limb of section 294 only when the intended injury is

6

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. In our opinion, it is this 3rd limb

of section 294 which principally corresponds to the second clause of section 293; and (as is

to be expected) every intention contemplated in the latter second clause is not also

contemplated in the former 3rd limb. An injury which is only likely to cause death is one in

respect of which there is no certainty that death will ensure, whereas the injury referred to

in the 3rd limb of section 294 is one which is certain or nearly certain to result in death if

there is no medical or surgical intervention. This comparison satisfies us that the object of

the Legislature was to distinguish between the cases of culpable homicide defined in the

second clause of section 293, and to provide in the 3rd limb of section 294 that only the

graver cases (as just explained) will be cause of murder. If this was not the object of the

Legislature, then there would be no substantial difference between culpable homicide as

defined in the second clause of section 293 and murder as defined in the 3rd limb of section

294. It will be seen also that if the object of the 2nd limb of section 294 was to adopt more

or less completely the second clause of section 293, then the 3rd limb of section 294 would

be very nearly superfluous.”

His Lordship has further stated in the said judgment that

“There is evidence also of a similar design in the 4th limb of section 294; knowledge, that an

act is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily

injury as is likely to cause death, is knowledge, not merely of the likelihood of causing

death, but of the high probability of causing death or injury likely to cause death; so that

many cases which fall within the third clause of section 293 will not be under within the

meaning of the 4th limb of section 294.”

In the said case of Somapala V. The Queen, it is not only clause 2 of section 293 of the Penal Code,

but also clause 3 of section 293 with its corresponding limb in section 294 had been considered

and it is clear that the Court of Appeal was properly guided by the said decision and therefore I

see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Court of Appeal when the Court of Appeal

concluded,

“That the framework of this case is the remainder when the section 294 is taken off the

section 293. It is further clarified, when the facts of this case are substituted for the

7

explanation 2 of section 293, since any one of the 4 limbs in section 294 are not found

among those facts, what we find here is not a murder, but a culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. When there is an intention to cause bodily injury likely to cause

death, which is in the 2nd clause of section 293 and the injury caused is not necessarily

results in death in the ordinary cause of nature such an act comes within the first part of

section 297 of the Penal Code.”

The second ground of Appeal of the Appellant was based on section 333 (5) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979.

The said sub section 5 of section 333 reads as follows;

“The time during which an Appellant, pending the determination of his appeal is admitted

to bail and (subject to any directions which the Court of Appeal may give to the contrary on

any appeal) the time during which the Appellant if in custody is specially treated as an

Appellant under this section, shall not count as part of any term of imprisonment under his

sentence; and any imprisonment of the Appellant whether it is under the sentence

imposed by the High Court or Court of Appeal shall subject to the directions or order of the

Court of Appeal be deemed to be resumed or to being to run, as the case requires, if the

Appellant is in custody, as from the day on which the appeal is determined and, if he is not

in custody, as from the day on which he is received into prison under the sentence.”

When going through the above provisions, it is clear, that the time spent in custody pending the

decision of the appeal from the Court of Appeal, shall not counts as part of any term of

imprisonment subject to one exception to the effect that “subject to any direction which the Court

of Appeal may give to the contrary on any Appeal” and as observed by me, the said direction the

Court of Appeal may give is the discretion of the Court considering the circumstances under which

the court decides the Appeal which is before them.

As observed by me, the appellant was convicted for the indictment and sentenced to death by the

High Court. In Appeal, the Court of Appeal had correctly analyzed the evidence available in the

said case and set-aside the above convictions and sentence and replaced it with a conviction for

culpable homicide not amounting murder under part one of the section 297 of the Penal Code. As

8 further observed by me, part one of section 297 of the Penal Code had provided a sentence which

may extend to twenty years and shall also liable to a fine.

When imposing the sentence, the Court of Appeal had decided to impose a jail sentence of 15 years

with a fine as referred to in this judgment. When deciding the said term, the court was mindful of the

circumstances under which the offence committed, the allocutus made by the Appellant and all other

matters relevant and should have been considered when imposing a sentence. The Appellant had not

complained against the jail term imposed but the complaint before this court, is the failure by the

Court of Appeal to use its discretion under 333 (5) and make order to begin the sentence from the

date of conviction by the High Court. In this regard the Appellant had submitted that she had to serve

a jail term of 18 years, but as observed in sub section 5 of section 333, the period the Appellant was

in remand pending the disposal of the Appeal cannot be considered as a part of the sentence.

As discussed above, the Court of Appeal when imposing the sentence, was mindful of all these

aspects and had decided to impose a sentence 5 years less than the maximum sentence the court

could impose for the offence the Appellant was convicted. The Court of Appeal had arrived at the

said decision, giving due consideration to the matters placed before the Court of Appeal and

therefore I see no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed on the Appellant.

For the reasons setout above I am not inclined to interfere with the findings of the Court of Appeal

I therefore make order dismissing this Appeal.

Appeal dismissed. Conviction and Sentence affirmed.
