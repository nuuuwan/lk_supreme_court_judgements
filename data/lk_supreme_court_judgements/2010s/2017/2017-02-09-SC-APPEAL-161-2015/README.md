WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT-RESPONDENT-RESPONDENT FILED ON: 15.12.2015 ARGUED ON: 11.11.2016 DECIDED ON: 09.02.2017 GOONERATNE J. This was an action filed in the District Court of Mathugama to

partition a land called “Delgahawatta” in extent of about 1 Acre, more fully

described in the schedule to the plaint. Parties proceeded to trial on 15 points

of contest. Learned District Judge Mathugama after trial entered Judgment in

favour of the Plaintiff on 30.04.2008. The 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants appealed to

the Civil Appellate High Court, Kalutara and the High Court dismissed the appeal

and affirmed the Judgment of the learned District Judge. The said Defendants

being aggrieved by both the above Judgments sought Leave to Appeal from the

Supreme Court and this court on 25.09.2015 granted Leave to Appeal on

questions of law set out in paragraph 16(A) to (D) of the petition dated

05.01.2015. The said questions reads thus:

(a) Did the learned High Court Judges err in holding that the land sought to

be partitioned is the land depicted in the Preliminary Plan

5

(b) Did the learned High Court Judges err in affirming the judgment of the

learned District Judge thereby accepting that though the land sought to

be partitioned are two different lands parties have possessed same as

Delgahawatta which is the land sought to be partitioned.

(c) Did the learned High Court Judges err in failing to take in to cognizance of

the principle of law that there is a duty cast on a Judge trying a partition

suit to identify the land sought to be partitioned as decided in the case of

Jayasuriya vs Ubaid 61 NLR 352.

(d) Did the learned High Court Judges fail to consider that the learned District

Judge has not duly considered and evaluated the oral and documentary

evidence with regard to the identity of the corpus sought to be

partitioned.

The only point urged before the Supreme Court was on the

question of identity of the land sought to be partitioned. Appellants, before this

court fault the High Court and the District Court in their failure to evaluate oral

and documentary evidence with regard to the identity of the corpus.

The learned High Court Judge observes, in a brief Judgment, on the

preliminary plan the Commissioner states that the land surveyed do not tally

with the boundaries described in the plaint, and the High Court Judge states the

Commissioner does not state it is not the land sought to be partitioned. The

learned High court Judge also state that the Defendant-Appellant moved for a

commission to identify lands called ‘Meegahawatta’ and

‘Migahaingewattegodella’ depicted in Title Plan 269303 and Title Plan 339864

6

respectively and after superimposition, plan ‘Y’ (No 1050A) produced, and

learned High Court Judge observes that identification of the corpus upon

superimposition of Title Plan is acceptable and land sought to be partitioned is

not called ‘Meegahawatta’ or ‘Migahaingewattegodella’. It appears that the

High Court Judge place emphasis on certain items of evidence of the Surveyor

which according to Survey’s evidence, land sought to be partitioned is called

‘Delgahawatta’. However Surveyor’s report X1 (folio 72) and item 5 of same

clarifies the position. I will advert to same in this Judgment.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent in their written submissions

support the views of Judgments of both lowers courts, and argues that

boundaries in the schedule to the plaint are identified except the southern

boundary and the extent almost same, variation being 3 perches. Further

Surveyor’s report on the eastern boundary (Dola) in the schedule to the plaint is

about 4 chains away from the corpus. Plaintiff produced marked P4 partition

plan No. 2125 filed in D.C. Kalutara Case No. P 1788. In that plan it is stated as

the eastern boundary of preliminary plan 1050. But I observe that P4 does not

seem to show “Delgahawatta” as any of its boundaries.

The learned counsel for 3rd and 4th Defendants-Appellants-

Petitioners-Appellants, in order to stress the point on identity of the corpus,

invited this court to consider the duty cast upon the trial court in this regard. He

7

drew the attention of this court to Section 25(1) of the Partition Law. i.e

particularly on examination of title of land to which the action relates. He also

cited important cases on the supervening duty and a fundamental duty of the

trial court to satisfy itself as to identity of corpus. Jayasuriya Vs. Ubaid 61 NLR

352; Wickramaratne Vs. Alpenis Perera 1986 (1) SLR 190; Sopinona Vs.

Pitipanaarachchi and other 2010 (1) SLR 91.

It was the learned counsel’s further submission that except for the

northern boundary in the land sought to be partitioned, none of the other

boundaries of the preliminary plan correspond to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint. As such it appears that the discrepancy in the boundaries

of the land surveyed with that of the land described in plaint cannot be

reconciled so easily. Even the Plaintiff-Respondent does not deny the above

discrepancy nor provide an acceptable explanation but attempt to show that it

is not a matter that has any bearing to the case in hand. I am unable to accept

the contention of Plaintiff-Respondent in this regard.

I would as stated above incorporate as follows, survey’s report

(clause 5) which explains above.

The boundaries of the land surveyed by me does not agree with the

boundaries described in the schedule to the plaint. Eastern boundary of

the land sought to be partitioned is described as Dola. But the actual

Eastern boundary is Lot in partition plan No. 2125, dated 24th January

8

1968, prepared by Mr. W.R.B. Silva, Licd. Surveyor, filed of record in D.C.

Kalutara case No. P 1788, which was produced by Plaintiff. As per same

plan the name of the land surveyed by me is Metiokandegodella, whereas

Delgahawattha as per schedule to the plaint.

Our attention was drawn to the statutory requirement in Section

18(1)(a) of the Partition Law. The Court Commissioner is required as per the said

section to state, “whether or not the land surveyed is substantially the same

land sought to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint. As

stated above the Court Commissioner very categorically state that the

boundaries of the land surveyed by him do not agree with the boundaries

described in the schedule to the plaint. This would no doubt cast a serious doubt

on the question of identity of the corpus. Learned counsel for Appellant also

referred to folio 320 of the brief, regarding lis pendens, registered where no

prior entries were available and stated therein subject to ‘decay’ ‘osrdm;a nejska’

The material available to this court no doubt suggest that the

boundaries of the land sought to be partitioned differ from the land described

in the schedule to the plaint. The extent is also different and not the same as

pleaded by Plaintiff. The Plaintiff produced marked P4 the partition plan No.

2125. Plan 2125 does not show ‘Delgahawatte’ as a boundary. In short the

location, boundaries and extent differ. Plaintiff himself admits in evidence that

9

the land surveyed is in fact land depicted in Survey General’s Title Plan No.

339864 and Title Plan 269302. Lots A, B & C is comprised in preliminary plan

1050 (X) and the commission plan 1050 A are filed of record. (By the same

Surveyor) which has lots A, B1, B2, B3 & C. The lots A, B & C in plan 1050 are

shown as A, B1, B2, B3 & C in plan No. 1050A. Lot A in plan 1050A is the same as

lot A in plan 1050. This lot A is part of Title Plan 339864 which is called

‘Migahaingewattegodella’ lot B1 is part of lot B in plan 1050 and part of Title

Plan 269302. Lot B2 is part of lot ‘B’ in preliminary plan 1050 are part of Title

Plan 269303 called Metiokandegodella. Lot B3 is part of lot B in plan 1050 and

is part of Title Plan 339864, called ‘Migahaingewattegodella’. Lot ‘C’ is a path

(part of T.P 269303 & 339864). As such the names of land are also different, and

not the land called Delgahawatta.

The statutory requirement in a partition case is discussed in the

case of Sopiya Silva Vs. Magilin Silva 1989(2) SLR 105. (Judgment of S.N. Silva J.

as he was then). It refers to Section 16(1) of the Partition Law. It implies that the

land Surveyed must confirm substantially, with the land as described in the

plaint (in respect of which a lis pendens had been registered) as regards location,

boundaries and the extent . It is for this reason that Section 18(1) (a) (iii) requires

the Surveyor to express an opinion in his report.

10

The Commissioner has not identified the corpus. Learned District

Judge should have, based on the Commissioner’s report insisted upon due

compliance with the requirement by the Surveyor. It has not been done. It is

very clear that the land described in the plaint is different and at this stage it

cannot be reconciled. The location, extent, boundaries and name of land are

different. Both the District Court and the Civil Appeal Court erred in law and fact.

As such I answer all questions of law in favour of the Appellant in the affirmative.

Yes.

Judgments of the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court

are set aside. Appeal allowed with costs.

Appeal allowed.
