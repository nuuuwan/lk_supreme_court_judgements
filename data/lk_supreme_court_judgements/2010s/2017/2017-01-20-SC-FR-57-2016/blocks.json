    "text": "Thus, in the early case of PERERA vs. UNIVERSITIES GRANTS COMMISSION [1978-79-80 1 SLR 128 at 137-138], Sharvananda J, as he then was, explained that, \"Constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights are directed against the State and its organs. Only infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right can form the subject matter of a complaint under Article 126 of the Constitution. The wrongful act of any individual, unsupported by State authority is simply a private wrong. Only if it is sanctioned by the State or done by the State authority, does it constitute a matter for complaint under Article 126. Fundamental rights operate only between individuals and the State. In the context of fundamental rights the `State\u201f includes every repository of State power. The expression `executive or administrative action\u201f embraces executive action of the State or its agencies or instrumentalities exercising Governmental functions. It refers to exertion of State power in all its forms\".. On the same lines, in WIJETUNGA vs. INSURANCE CORPORATION [1982 1 SLR 1 at p.5-6], Sharvananda J observed, \u201cAll organs of Government are mandated to respect the fundamental rights referred to in Chap.3 of the Constitution and are prohibited from infringing same. Action by the organs of the Government alone constitutes the executive or administrative action that is a sine qua non or basis to proceedings under Article 126 \u201cThe term \u201eexecutive action\u201f comprehends official actions of all Government Officers \u2026\u2026 When private individuals or groups are endowed by the State with power or functions, governmental in nature, they become agencies or instrumentalities of the State subject to the constitutional inhibitions of the State.\u201d. Accordingly, it is evident that, in the above cases, this Court recognized that, the term \u201corgans of the government\u201d used in Article 4 (d) of the Constitution encompasses both the State and also its \u201cagencies and instrumentalities\u201d which exercise Governmental functions. It should be made clear that, in the context of the meaning of the term \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d, the words \u201cState\u201d and \u201cGovernment\u201d are used interchangeably and with the same meaning. Naturally so, since acts by the State or on behalf of the State are performed by the members and officers of the Government.",

Applying the same criteria, in JAYANETTI vs. LAND REFORM COMMISSION [1984 2 SLR 172], Wanasundera J held the Land Reform Commission, which was a corporate body established by Statute, was an instrumentality of the State since it was set up to manage vast acres of State land in compliance with State policy and subject to close State control in its activities and its finances. In DAHANAYAKE vs. DE SILVA [1978-79-80 1 SLR 47], the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was regarded as an agency of the State since it had a monopoly on the sale of petroleum products which are not a mere consumer item of private trade and since it provided an essential service by distributing and selling these petroleum products to the people.",

His Lordship held that this would be so even if the ownership was through another legal entity and the control was exercised through another legal entity who acted as the agent. Thus, Fernando J held [at p.373] \u201cThe chain of ownership and control may extend indefinitely: e.g. the State may set up a corporation which it (in substance) owns and controls; that corporation may set up a limited liability company which it (in substance) owns and controls; and that company in turn may set up another company or other entity . . . and so on. But however long the chain may be, if ultimately it is the State which has effective ownership and control, all those entities - every link in that chain - are State agencies. I hold that the 2nd Respondent is a State agency. Even if it was performing purely commercial functions, it would nevertheless be a State agency, albeit a State agency performing commercial functions.\u201d and [at p.376], \u201cThe liabilities which direct action would attract, could not be evaded by resorting to indirect action.\u201d. In ORGANIZATION OF PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS & RIGHTS OF INSURANCE EMPLOYEES vs. PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM COMMISSION [2007 2 SLR 316]. Bandaranayake J, as she then was, held that, following the State divesting the Shares it held in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd and ceasing to have any effective control over that corporate body, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd, which was a duly incorporated Company, was not an agency or instrumentality of the State.",

Where the body whose action is sought to be impugned is a corporate entity these tests have focussed, among other things on the nature of the functions performed by the relevant body, the question whether the state is the beneficiary of its activities, the manner of is constitution, whether by statutory incorporation or otherwise, the dependence of the body whose action is sought to be challenged on state funds, the degree of control exercised by the State, the existence in it of sovereign characteristics or features, and whether it is otherwise an instrumentality or agency of the State.

    "text": "Although I have, for purposes of easy reference, set out the above list of some of the identifying characteristics of a corporate body which is an agency or instrumentality of the State, it is important to keep in mind that, this list is by no means exhaustive. Further, it must be stressed that, the presence of one or more of these identifying characteristics does not, necessarily, lead to the conclusion that a corporate body is an agency or instrumentality of the State. Instead, it is, usually, the cumulative effect of some of these identifying characteristics being found in a corporate body, which leads to the conclusion that it is an agency or instrumentality of the State. As Bhagwati J, as he then was, emphasised in RAMANA DAYARAM SHETTY vs. THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY OF INDIA [at p.642], \u201c\u2026.. it is not possible to make an exhaustive enumeration of the tests which would invariably and in all cases provide an unfailing answer to the question whether a corporation is governmental instrumentality or agency\u2026.It is the aggregate and cumulative effect of all the relevant factors that is controlling.\u201d. I will now consider, in the light of the aforesaid characteristics of a corporate body which is an agency or instrumentality of the State, the first preliminary objection raised by the 1st to 3rd Respondents and 4th and 12th Respondent \u2013 namely, the contention that, the impugned acts do not constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative acts\u201d as contemplated in Articles 17 and 126 (1) of the Constitution and that, therefore, this Court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain this application. The impugned acts \u2013 ie: the suspension of the Petitioner\u201fs services by the letter marked \u201cP24\u201d and the termination of the Petitioner\u201fs services by the letter marked \u201cP27\u201d - have been done by MPMC or on behalf of MPMC. Since the impugned acts were done by or on behalf of MPMC, it is necessary to examine whether MPMC, which is a limited liability Company incorporated under the Companies Act, can be correctly considered to be an agency or instrumentality of the State. As set out above, it is only if the answer to that question is in the affirmative, that this Court will have the jurisdiction, under Article 17 read with Article 126 (1) of the Constitution, to entertain this application.",

Thirdly, it is evident that, the State, through the SLPA, exercises absolute control over MPMC since the SLPA is the sole shareholder of MPMC. It hardly needs to be stated that, where a duly incorporated Company has a sole shareholder, that shareholder wields absolute power to determine any aspect of the Company\u201fs operations and even existence. Since the State controls the sole shareholder of MPMC, the State wields this absolute power over MPMC. Further, though MPMC has its own Board of Directors, consisting of 09 Directors, which manages the business and affairs of MPMC in terms of Article 15 (1), all these Directors are nominated by Ministers of the State or by the SLPA. Thus, the first Managing Director, who is an executive Director and an employee of MPMC, is nominated by the Minister in charge of the SLPA. With regard to the other 08 Directors, 02 Directors are nominated by the Minister in charge of the SLPA from among the members of the Board of Directors of the SLPA. 03 more Directors are nominated by the Minister in charge of the SLPA. 01 Director is a representative of the General Treasury nominated by the Minister in charge of Finance. The remaining 02 Directors are the Director-Operations and the Director-Finance of the SLPA. All these Directors (other than the Managing Director of MPMC and the Director-Operations and the Director-Finance of the SLPA) are subject to removal by the Minister who appointed them. Thus, it is evident that, as a result of the Minister in charge of the SLPA and the SLPA having the power of determining the constitution of the Board of Directors of MPMC, the SLPA and the Minister exercise effective control over the business and affairs of MPMC. The fact that, SLPA has control over MPMC is tellingly illustrated by the letter dated 18th December 2015 marked \u201cP24\u201d which requires the Petitioner to show cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against him and suspends the Petitioner\u201fs services.

Thereafter, there is material before this Court to indicate that, the Minister in charge of Ports and Shipping exercised authority and took decisions relating to the operations of MPMC. This is evidenced by the report dated 06th October 2015 marked \u201cP13(e)\u201d which reveals that, reports relating to the operations of MPMC were submitted to the Minister for decisions and the letter dated 11th November 2015 marked \u201cP19\u201d which reveals that, the Minister chaired a meeting at which officials of the SLPA and the Petitioner participated and at which the Petitioner was directed to compile a report regarding a purchase of Diesel Oil. There is also material before this Court which establishes that, the State exercises a significant degree of control over the finances of MPMC. This is seen from Article 15 (v) and (vi) of the Articles of Association of MPMC which require that, the Business Plan of MPMC must be submitted to the General Treasury for approval and that, the annual Budget of MPMC must be submitted to the General Treasury. Further, the document marked \u201cP20\u201d establishes that, a \u201cReport on the Tank Farm and Bunkering Activities\u201d of MPMC was submitted to the Auditor General who required MPMC to furnish an explanation with regard to the losses incurred by MPMC and the remedial steps that MPMC intends to take. Further, the letter dated 10th December 2015 marked \u201cP22\u201d establishes that, the Minister of Finance called for an explanation from MPMC with regard to a purchase of bunker fuel and a loan obtained by MPMC and also that, a memorandum was submitted to the Cabinet on this issue. The circumstances I have referred to above establish that, the State both directly and through its organ, the SLPA, has deep and pervasive control over MPMC. Here too, as Fernando J pointed out in JAYAKODY\u2019s case, the fact that it is indirect control through SLPA, does not make a difference.",

    "text": "words of Krishan Aiyar J in SOM PRAKASH vs. UNION OF INDIA [at p.218] who stated, \u201c\u2026..merely because a Company or other legal person has functional and jural individuality for certain purposes and in certain areas of law, it does not necessarily follow that for the effective enforcement of fundamental rights under our constitutional scheme, we could not scan the real character of that entity; and if it is found to be a mere agent or surrogate of the State, in fact owned by the State, in truth controlled by the State and in effect an incarnation of the State, constitutional lawyers must not blink at these facts and frustrate the enforcement of fundamental rights\u2026\u2026\u201d. To sum up, the fact that, the State has effective ownership of MPMC, the fact that MPMC performs functions of public importance which are governmental in nature and the fact that, the State, both directly and through the SLPA, exercises deep and pervasive control over MPMC, lead me to conclude that, MPMC must be regarded as an agency or instrumentality of the State. Consequently, the impugned acts done by MPMC or on behalf of MPMC must be regarded as constituting \u201cexecutive or administrative acts\u201d within the meaning of Articles 17 and 126 (1) of the Constitution. Accordingly, I overrule the first preliminary objection. The second preliminary objection has to be now considered. Namely, the contention that, the impugned acts arise from or relate to a Contract of Employment which is commercial in nature and which has no statutory basis or connection. It is submitted that, therefore, the Petitioner\u201fs remedy is limited to Private Law and the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court. In support of this contention, it has also been submitted that, Article 15 (iv) of the Articles of Association of MPMC specifies that it is the Board of Directors of MPMC which must formulate the schemes of recruitment and promotion of employees of MPMC and the code of rules of discipline applicable to employees of MPMC. On this basis, it is submitted that, there is no provision for State control or interference in MPMC\u201fs dealings with its employees and that, therefore, the contract of employment between the Petitioner and MPMC is one which is entirely commercial in nature with no statutory basis or connection - ie: with no \u201estatutory underpinnings\u201f as it is sometimes said. In pursuance of this argument, Counsel appearing for the 1st to 3rd Respondents and 4th and 12th Respondents submit that, the Contract of Employment set out in the Letter of Appointment marked \u201cP4\u201d provides for the termination of the Petitioner\u201fs employment with one month\u201fs notice and that there is no contractual obligation to hold a disciplinary inquiry before terminating the Petitioner\u201fs employment. They submit that, the Petitioner is not a `public servant\u201f and that, therefore, the Petitioner\u201fs remedy, if any, lies in Private Law and that the Petitioner cannot invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court. In support of this argument, learned Counsel have cited and rely on the decisions in ROBERTS vs. RATNAYAKE and WIJENAIKE vs. AIR LANKA LTD. In ROBERTS vs. RATNAYAKE, the majority judgment held that, where the State or one of its agencies entered into a contract with another party, the State was bound to not violate the fundamental rights of that person during the `threshold\u201f stage of",

It was held that, once the contract was entered into and the `threshold\u201f stage was passed, the rights of the State and the other party to the contract were governed solely by the contract unless the contract had a statutory basis or connection \u2013 ie: unless the contract has what is sometimes referred to as `statutory underpinnings\u201f. The Court held that, after the `threshold\u201f stage was passed, the fundamental rights of the other party ceased to have any application to the dealings between the State and that party under the contract unless the contract has a statutory basis or connection. Thus, Ranasinghe J, as he then was, held [at p. 44-45], \u201cAny act done, therefore, in pursuance of a term or condition, set out in a contract entered into between a citizen and the State, would not, ordinarily, come within the term `law' so set out in the said Article; and a breach or violation of any such term or condition would not attract to it the provisions of Article 12 (1). An act, done in pursuance of a term or condition contained in such a contract and which said act is said to be a violation, could found a complaint of an infringement of the right embodied in Article 12 (1) only where such term or condition has a statutory origin, or has, at least, what has been referred to in another connection, a `statutory flavour\u201f. It is only where the State has acted in the context, and in the sphere of `law\u201f, as defined in Article 170, that any invocation of Article 12 (1) could be entertained \u2026.. where the State enters into a contract with a citizen in pursuance of any statutory power, the State, or such State agency is, at the `threshold stage\u201f, or the stage at which such contract is being entered into, bound by the operation of the provisions of Article 12(1) of the Constitution: that, once such an agreement is validly entered into, all parties to such agreement \u2013 the State, the State agency, and the citizen - are all ordinarily bound only by the terms and conditions set out in such agreement;\u201d. In WIJENAIKE vs. AIR LANKA LTD, Kulatunga J endorsed the view taken by the majority in ROBERTS vs. RATNAYAKE that, where the State has entered into a contract, fundamental rights have no application after the \u201ethreshold\u201f stage of the contract is passed. With regard to contracts of employment where the State or its agencies or instrumentalities is the employer, Kulatunga J took the view that, unlike in the case of `public servants\u201f whose employment by the State is characterized by, in the words of Sharvananda CJ in PERERA vs. JAYAWICKREMA [1985 1 SLR 285 at p.301],\u201cThe concept of equality (which) permeates the whole spectrum of a public servant's employment\u2026..\u201d, the rights of employees who are not classified as `public servants\u201f are governed only by their contracts of employment unless these contracts of employment are governed by a statute or subsidiary legislation which requires that, the employer must accord equal treatment to all its employees and refrain from discrimination etc. His Lordship held [at p.316] \u201c\u2026.. in the case of a public corporation which is an agency of the government a breach of contract between an employee and the agency would not per se attract the provisions of Article 12 (1). Such an employee can complain of a violation of that Article only if the rights and obligations under the contract of employment are imposed by statutory provisions\u2026.. If the remedy sought arises purely from the contract based on the consent of parties, Articles 12 (1) and 126 have no application, in which event the dispute must be resolved by an ordinary suit provided by private law, even if the dispute involves an allegation of discrimination.\u201d.",

    "text": "When determining the aforesaid second preliminary objection raised in the present case, I would respectfully follow the line of authority set out in the aforesaid later decisions which hold that, the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court can be invoked by a Petitioner who alleges that an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State has violated his fundamental rights in the course of dealings under and in terms of a contract entered into between them. It seems to me that, this has to be so for the simple reason that, Article 4 (d) of the Constitution has an overarching effect which binds all organs, agencies and instrumentalities of the State in all things they do and at all points of time. Therefore, the fact that an organ, agency or instrumentality of the Government has entered into a contract cannot release it from its duty, under Article 4 (d) of the Constitution, to respect, secure and advance the fundamental rights of the contracting party in the course of dealings under that contract. This duty will, necessarily, continue at all stages of the contract. This is a duty which an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State cannot escape from by entering into a contract and it is a right which the contracting party cannot cede or abandon by entering into a contract. The validity of this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, Article 15 of the Constitution allows restrictions on fundamental rights only in the limited situations specified therein and only if so prescribed by Law. There is no provision made in the Constitution to restrict the operation of fundamental rights by contract. This duty operates at the `threshold stage\u201f of awarding or entering into the contract and continues to operate in the course of the dealings under the contract.

To move on, the terms of the contract between the State and the contracting party will, naturally, determine the rights and obligations of both parties and a Court would give full recognition to the principle that, parties are free to determine the contents of the contract and should be held to what they have agreed to. Thus, the terms and conditions of the contract would usually determine whether or not the rights of either party have been violated. However, when one of the contracting parties is an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State, there is the overriding obligation cast on it to comply with Article 4 (d) of the Constitution and not violate the fundamental rights of the other party in the course of dealings under the contract. In practice, this means that, while the terms of the contract would, usually, be the determining factor when assessing whether an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State has violated the rights of the other party in the course of dealings under a contract and the general rule is that, a party who acts in accordance with the terms of the contract does not violate the rights of the other party, the position would be different if the organ, agency or instrumentality of the State has used the terms of the contract as a cover for malicious, perverse or arbitrary acts. This is so since the State and its organs, agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to act with good faith in their dealings with the people including where such dealings are in pursuance of a contract. As Amerasinghe J stated in WICKREMATUNGA\u2019s case [at p.213], \u201cIt is well settled that a public body like the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, a statutory public corporation \u2013 must act in good faith and act reasonably\u201d. In this regard, it is also apt to cite the decision of the Supreme Court of India in F.C.I. vs. KAMDHENU CATTLEFEED INDUSTRIES [1993 1 SCC 71] where it was held that, the State must conform to the requirements of Article 14 of the Constitution of India [which is on similar lines to Article 12 of our Constitution] when the State enters into contracts and that this imposes a duty to act fairly and to adopt procedure that is `fairplay in action\u201f which is the legitimate expectation of every citizen. Thus, organs, agencies and instrumentalities of the State are to be guided by the requirement of good faith in their contractual dealings and a departure from this standard by misusing a contractual term or committing a deliberate breach of contract in a malicious or perverse or arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable manner, could well amount to an act which violates the fundamental rights of the victim if the impugned act violates one or more of his fundamental rights declared and recognized in Chapter III of the Constitution. It should be made clear that, where an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State acts in breach of a contract due to bona fide commercial or operational factors or inadvertence or unavoidable circumstances or as a result of a bona fide revised policy or for similar reasons, that breach per se is unlikely to amount to a violation of the fundamental rights of the other party and would, usually, attract only the remedies available under the contract.

    "text": "unwilling to substitute its own opinion of what should have been done under the contract in place of the decision taken by the contracting party. But, where there has been a deliberate misuse of a term of the contract or a deliberate breach of the contract in a malicious or perverse or arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable manner, then there could be a violation of the fundamental rights of the other party. This is because, in such cases, the impugned act may amount to a violation of Article 12 (1) or another Article in Chapter III of the Constitution by reason of the malice, perversity, arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness of the impugned act. Each such case would have to be determined upon the facts and circumstances before the Court and in the context of the contract between the parties. When doing so, it should be kept in mind that, as mentioned earlier, the parties have agreed to be bound by the terms of the contract and the remedies available under the contract and that, therefore, unless the nature of the impugned act warrants the invocation of the fundamental rights of this Court for the reasons set out above or for such other reasons as the Court may consider relevant, the parties should be required to seek their remedies under the contract they have entered into. I am of the view that these principles are equally applicable whether the contract is of a commercial nature or is a contract of employment. An employer which is an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State, has the duty, under and in terms Article 4 (d) of the Constitution, to respect, secure and advance the fundamental rights of its employees. This entitles an employee of an organ, agency or instrumentality of the State to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court if he alleges that his employer has violated his fundamental rights in connection with the contract of employment in the manner set out above. The fact that, the employee is not categorized as a `public servant\u201f cannot disentitle him from that constitutional right. It is apt to cite Fernando J in HEWAMALLIKAGE vs. PEOPLE\u2019S BANK [291/93 SCM 14.10.1994] who stated \u201cI hold that the appointment, transfer, dismissal, and disciplinary control of employees of the State and State agencies constitute `executive or administrative action\u201f within the meaning of Article 126.\u201d. When the aforesaid principles are applied to the present case, the second preliminary objection has to be overruled. For the aforesaid reasons, I overrule the two preliminary objections taken by the 1st to 3rd and 4th and 12th Respondents and hold that this Court has the jurisdiction to proceed to hear and determine this application. The 1st and 4th Respondents must pay the Petitioner costs in a sum of Rs.50,000/-. Thus, the Petitioner is entitled to a total sum of Rs.100,000/- as costs. This application should now be supported for leave to proceed, upon the merits of the Petitioner\u201fs case. Judge of the Supreme Court",
