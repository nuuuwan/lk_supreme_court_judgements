Respondent-Respondents Before : Sisira J de Abrew J Anil Goonerathne J Nalin Perera J Counsel : Faiz Musthapa PC for the Substituted Petitioner-Appellant Rajeev Gunatilake SSC for the Respondent-Respondent Written Submissions tendered on : 11.7.2017 by the Substituted Petitioner-Appellant 20.6.2017 by the Respondent-Respondent Argued on : 7.6.2017 Decided on : 13.09.2017 Sisira J De Abrew J. The Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner-Appellant) claims that she and her children are the owners of the land in

dispute.

The acquisition of the land in dispute commenced in 1980 by publishing a

Section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act notice (hereinafter referred to as the Section

2 notice) and an order made under proviso to Section 38(a) of the Land Acquisition

Act (hereinafter referred to as the order under Section 38(a) proviso). The order

3

under Section 38(a) proviso was published in Government Gazette No.102/6 dated

20.8.1980 marked as 1R2. Notice under Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act

(hereinafter referred to as Section 7 notice) too was published in Government

Gazette No.179/8 dated 11.2.1982 marked as P6. The Petitioner-Appellant filed a

Writ Application in the Court of Appeal) seeking a writ of certiorari to quash P6

and seeking a writ of mandamus against the 1st Respondent-Respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent) directing him to revoke in

terms of Section 39(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as the

Act), any vesting order made in relation to the Government Gazette notification

marked P6 or in the alternative, publish a gazette notification in terms of Section

39A of the Act divesting the Petitioner-Appellant’s property. The Petitioner-

Appellant further sought a writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay

compensation to the Petitioner-Appellant regarding the acquisition. The Court of

Appeal, by its judgment dated 9.5.2006 dismissed the case of the Petitioner-

Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Petitioner-Appellant has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 16.10.2006, granted leave to

appeal on the following questions of law.

1. Whether the Petitioner-Appellant is entitled, in law, to have the subject

matter divested since the property had not been used for the public purpose

for which it was acquired during the period of last 26 years.

2. Whether the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have failed to follow the proper

procedure with regard to the payment of compensation.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant submitted that

although the land had been acquired under the proviso to Section 38(a) of the Act,

the land has not been used for any public purpose. He therefore contended that the

4

1st respondent should act under Section 39(1) of the Act. Section 39(1) of the Act

reads as follows.

“Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 ( hereinafter

in this section referred to as a “ vesting order”) any land has vested

absolutely in the State, the Minister may, if possession of the land has not

actually been taken for and on behalf of the State in pursuance of that

Order, by subsequent Order published in the Gazette revoke the vesting

order.”

The governing part of the above section, in my view, is the following phrase:

“if possession of the land has not actually been taken for and on behalf of the State

in pursuance of that order.”

In my view if the possession of the land has not been taken for and on behalf

of the State, the Minister has the power to make an order under Section 39(1) of

the Act. But if the possession of the land has been taken over for and on behalf of

the State, the Minister has no power to make an order Section 39(1) of the Act. I

will now examine whether the possession of the land has been taken over by the

State or not. The Petitioner-Appellant, in his petition and in his statement made to

the Police, (P39) states that the possession of the land has not been taken over. But

the 1st Respondent in his affidavit states that the possession of the land has been

taken over by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) on 2.10.1980. The

document marked 2R2 indicates that 44 people had been paid compensation for the

acquisition of the land in question. If the possession of the land in question has not

been taken over for and on behalf of the State, how did the State pay compensation

to 44 claimants? This document indicates that the possession of the land has been

5

taken over for and on behalf of the State. When I consider all the above facts, I

hold that the possession of the land has been taken over by the State. Therefore the

Minister (the 1st Respondent) cannot revoke the vesting order in terms of Section

39(1) of the Act. Therefore the court cannot issue a writ of mandamus directing the

1st Respondent to revoke, in terms of Section 39(1) of the Act, the vesting order.

For the above reasons, I hold that the Court of Appeal was correct when it refused

to issue a writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to revoke, in terms of

section 39(1) of the Act, the vesting order.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant next contended that

the 1st Respondent had a duty to issue a divesting order in terms of Section 39A of

the Act. I now advert to this contention. Section 39A(1) and 39A (2) of the Act

read as follows.

39A(1):

Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 ( hereafter in this section

referred to as a “ vesting Order “) any land has vested absolutely in the State and actual

possession of such land has been taken for or on behalf of the State under the provisions

of Paragraph (a) of section 40, the Minister may, subject to sub section (2), by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette ( hereafter in this section referred to as a “

divesting Order”) divest the State of the land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

39A(2):

The Minister shall prior to making a divesting Order under subsection (1) satisfy himself that-

a) no compensation has been paid under this Act to any person or persons interested in

the land in relation to which the said divesting Order is to be made;

b) the said land has not been used for a public purpose after possession of such land has

been taken by the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40;

6

c) no improvements to the said land have been effected after the Order for possession

under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made; and

d) the person or persons interested in the said land have consented in writing to take

possession of such land immediately after the divesting Order is published in the

Gazette.

According to Section 39A(2) of the Act, the Minister, prior to making a

divesting order, should satisfy himself that the following conditions have been

fulfilled.

1. no compensation has been paid under this Act to any person or persons

interested in the land in relation to which the said divesting Order is to be

made;

2. the said land has not been used for a public purpose after possession of such

land has been taken by the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of

section 40;

3. no improvements to the said land have been effected after the Order for

possession under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made;

4. the person or persons interested in the said land have consented in writing to

take possession of such land immediately after the divesting Order is

published in the Gazette.

What happens if compensation has been paid to the claimants? Then the Minister is

not empowered to make a divesting order in terms of Section 39A of the Act

because in such a situation condition No.1 in Section 39A (2) has not been

fulfilled.

At this stage it is relevant to consider the judicial decision in the case of Rashid Vs

Rajitha Senaratne Minister of Lands and Another [2004] 1 SLR 312.

7

This Court observed the following facts in the above case.

“The petitioner was the owner of 1/16 share of a land and building, No. 2 New

Bazaar Street, Nuwara Eliya. Proceedings for acquiring the said land commenced

in 1983. A section 2 notice was published in respect of the land. This was followed by an

order for the acquisition of the land under section 38 proviso (a)-of the Land Acquisition

Act. The notice of the order did not specify the purpose of the acquisition; and the acquiring

proceedings continued for 17 years. The land was not used for any purpose although

possession of the land was given to the Urban Development Authority.

A notice under section 7 of the Act was published calling for claims to the land. The

appellant claimed title and compensation to the land. As different decisions were being

made by the acquiring officer, the appellant applied for a writ of mandamus to compel

finality to the proceedings. That case was settled when the Surveyor-General made a plan

NU/1839 dated 15.12.97 showing the premises acquired as 25:25 purchase viz., premises

No. 2 aforesaid.

In view of the continuing delay of proceedings the appellant applied inter alia, for a writ of

mandamus to direct the Minister to make an order divesting the property under section 39A

of the Act.

The application satisfied the pre-conditions in section 39A for divesting, but the

Court of Appeal dismissed it stating that it could not be shown that the acquisition

was ultra vires.” This Court held:

“1. The Minister never claimed that the land was required for a particular public

purpose.

2. For the issue of mandamus to compel a divesting of the land under section 39A of the

Act, it is unnecessary to establish that the acquisition was ultra vires.

3. The appellant was entitled to a writ of mandamus for a divesting of No. 2 New

Bazaar Street depicted in the Surveyor-General’s plan UN/1839 dated 15.12.97 and a writ of

certiorari quashing the initial order of acquisition.”

8

In Rashid’s case (supra) the applicant had satisfied the pre-conditions in

Section 39A. But in the present case condition No.1in Section 39A (2) has not

been fulfilled. Therefore the principles enunciated in Rashid’s case are not

applicable to the present case.

The document marked 2R2 states that the State had paid compensation to

44 people. Therefore the Minister cannot make a divesting order in terms of

Section 39A of the Act. When I consider the aforementioned matters, I hold that

the Court of Appeal was correct when it refused to issue a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent to issue a divesting order under Section 39A of the

Act.

For all the aforementioned reasons, I answer the 1st question of law in the

negative.

The Petitioner-Appellant also sought a writ of mandamus directing the 1st

Respondent to pay her compensation. But the Court of Appeal refused to grant the

said relief. Was the Court of Appeal right when it made the above order? I now

advert to this question. Although Section 7 notice was published, the Petitioner did

not make any claim for compensation. The inquiry under Section 17 of the Act was

concluded in 1983 and compensation was paid to 44 people but the petitioner

maintained silence with regard to her alleged claim. The document marked 2R2

indicates that compensation was paid to 44 people. Under these circumstances the

above relief sought by the Petitioner-Appellant cannot be granted. For the above

reasons, I hold that the Court of Appeal was correct when it refused to grant the

above relief. For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the 2nd question of law in

the negative.

9

For the aforementioned reasons, I affirm the judgment of the Court

of Appeal and dismiss this appeal. Considering the facts of this case, I do not make

an order for costs.

Appeal dismissed.
