Sisira J. de Abrew, J Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. Learned State Counsel also

made submissions.

The Petitioner in this case complains that he was arrested on 21.06.2013 by the 1st

Respondent who is the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station, Teldeniya. He was later

produced before the Magistrate, Teldeniya as a suspect for stealing eleven pieces of

sandalwood from the Magistrate’s Court of Teldeniya. He was a Civil Security Guard attached

to Teldeniya Police Station. The Petitioner further complains that after the arrest he was

assaulted by the 1st Respondent. Petitioner tries to support the assault launched by the 1st

Respondent by his wife’s affidavit marked as P8.Petitioner’s wife Renuka Malkanthi

Wickramasinghe in the said affidavit states that on 21st of June 2013 around 4.00 p.m she

received a telephone call from her husband to the effect that he ( her husband) was in police

custody and after the receipt of the said telephone call she proceeded to Teldeniya Police

Station. She, in her affidavit, further states that at Teldeniya Police Station she saw her

husband being assaulted by the 1st Respondent. She further states that her husband’s face,

hands and two sides of the body were swollen. This observation suggests that the Petitioner had

sustained injuries in the said areas. But in the petition and affidavit filed by the Petitioner in

this Court , he does not state that the 1st Respondent gave blows to the said areas of the

body. This discrepancy itself raises certain doubts about the truth of the Petitioner’s story. We

further note that the Petitioner’s wife has not annexed her affidavit to the original petition filed

4

by the Petitioner in this Court. The affidavit filed by the Petitioner's wife marked P8 has been

annexed only with the counter affidavit of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner also tries to support the assault launched by the 1st Respondent by an

affidavit given by Charuka Iroshana Ratnayake marked P9. According to P9, he was arrested

by Police officers attached to Teldeniya Police Station around 4.30 p.m on 21.06.2013 and was

brought to the Police Station, Teldeniya. We note that the said affidavit has also been marked

only along with the counter affidavit of the Petitioner. The said affidavit has not been annexed

to the original petition and affidavit of the Petitioner. Thus the truth of the material stated

in P8 and P9 is doubtful.

After he was arrested he was produced before the Magistrate and he was granted bail on

24.06.2013. Thereafter he got himself admitted to Teldeniya Hospital. He had complained to the

Doctor at Teldeniya Hospital that he was assaulted by the 1st Respondent in his genital region,

lower abdomen, neck and right hand. But the Doctor has observed contusion only on left

thigh. Although the Doctor observed a contusion on the left thigh, the Petitioner had not

complained to the Doctor that he was assaulted by the O.I.C in his left thigh. When we consider

the above material, we observe that there is a discrepancy between his complaint to the Doctor

and the observations made by the Doctor.

This Court by its order dated 25.08.2014 has granted leave to proceed for alleged

violation of Article 11 of the Constitution. When a person makes an allegation of torture under

Article 11 of the Constitution, a high degree of certainty of his story is required. This view is

supported by the judicial decision in Channa Pieris and others Vs The Attorney-General -

5

1994(1) SLR page 01 wherein His Lordship Dr. Justice A.R.B. Amarasinghe held thus:- “

Having regard to the nature and gravity of the issue, a high degree of certainty is required,

before the balance of probability might be said to tilt in favour of a Petitioner endeavouring to

discharge his burden of proving that he was subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment.”

We have earlier pointed out that the story narrated by the Petitioner is doubtful. When we

consider all the above matters, we are unable to place high reliance on the story narrated by the

Petitioner. Therefore we hold that the Petitioner has not proved his case with high degree of

certainty. When we consider all the above matters, we are unable to believe the story narrated by

the Petitioner. For the above reasons, we dismiss the Petitioner’s case. Considering the facts of

this case, we do not make an order for costs.

Petition is dismissed.
