GOONERATNE J. The two Petitioners, at all relevant times to this Fundamental Rights

Application held the post of Regional Investigating, Officer and Chief Postmaster

respectively in the Postal Department. It is pleaded that the two Petitioners

applied for a post in the said department. (which is a promotional post) and is

described in their petition as ‘unified postal service Grade ‘A’ Group III Segment

“A”.’ Interviews were held as pleaded in paragraph 11 of the petition. There

were 18 vacancies (P1).

It is further pleaded in paragraph 12 of the petition that the

Petitioners came to know that they had been promoted to the said grade on the

recommendation of the Interview Board consisting of 12th to 15th Respondents.

However main grievance of the two Petitioners were that the Interview Board

after selection as above has again met on their own on 22.03.2011, purely for

the purpose of promoting 16th & 17th Respondents who had not been selected

as above for the 18 vacancies earlier. It is further stated in the petition that they

came to know that there was an attempt to delete their names out of the earlier

promotion list and accommodate the 16th & 17th Respondents.

Petitioners complain that the result of the interview was not made

known or communicated. As such by P2 dated 08.08.2011, the Sri Lanka Postal

Service Union requested for the result of the interview from the 1st Respondent.

5

Thereafter the Petitioners along with the Secretary of the Postal Service Union

met the 1st Respondent on 17.08.2011 and inquired regarding the selection of

candidates from the selection list prepared by the 12th to 15th Respondents for

the above post. 1st Respondent then informed that the Petitioners had been

selected for the 17th & 18th vacancies but their names were omitted by the 12th

to 15th Respondents on 22.03.2011 and a new list had been made. In fact the

16th & 17th Respondents who were not selected in the first list had been included

in the subsequent list prepared by the 12th to 15th Respondents on 22.11.2011.

The 1st Respondent also informed that the 16th & 17th Respondents had also

been issued letters of appointment. In this regard an affidavit marked P3 is

submitted in support of above. The 1st Respondent also took steps to issue

documents requested by the said union marked P4 to P8. P9 is a letter issued by

the 1st Respondent and indicates that the said documents are issued. Petitioners

plead in paragraph 22 of the petition that action of the 1st to 15th Respondents

not to promote the Petitioners to the post for which they applied is arbitrary,

capricious, unreasonable and illegal for the reasons set out in paragraph 22(a)

to (k) of the petition. On 19.03.2012 this court granted Leave to Proceed for

alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Document P9 of course indicates that the 1st Respondent made

available the required documents on request, made in this regard. Disclosure by

6

the 1st Respondent enabled the Petitioners to move court. The same interview

panel had taken the liberty to alter the original selections list, and on their

second attempt very unfortunately displaced the Petitioners being selected for

the post they applied. It looks very unreasonable but this court needs to get to

the truth of the matter to ascertain whether in fact there was a violation.

I have to ascertain the reasons for the interview panel to have met

for the second time subsequent to selection of candidates. In this regard the

position of the official Respondents need to be considered. The successor to the

office of Postmaster General the 2nd Respondent has sworn an affidavit before

this court, since the person named as 2nd Respondent was no longer holding

office and the successor had sworn an affidavit. The main points as pleaded are

as follows.

(1) Power of appointment/promotion is vested with the Public Service

Commission and not the interview panel. Petitioners were never

promoted to the ‘Unified Postal Service Group A Grade III Segment ‘A’

(2) It is emphasised that the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts had by letter

of 21.02.2011 (2R2) requested to ascertain whether the interview panel

had correctly given marks for “Performance Appraisals” of each

candidate. The 16th Respondent had complained that marks for the above

item had not been correctly assessed by the interview panel. As such the

said Secretary had given a direction as pleaded to request the Interview

Board to consider letter 2R1 and the appeal of the 16th Respondent,

thereafter to submit the recommendation of the interview panel to him.

7

Accordingly the interview panel had met on 22.03.2011 for the said

purpose (2R2).

(3) The 16th Respondent was involved in Trade Union activities and had been

released on a full time basis as from 22.11.2000. He was an officer of the

unified postal service and had been promoted on 18.10.2008 to the

unified postal service Grade A, Group III Segment B. It is pleaded that at

the time of the interview he was engaged in Trade Union activities and

question arose as to how he had to be assessed on performance appraisal.

The duties maintained in the appraisal forms were not the duties others

in the same grade as the 16th Respondent had to perform. Uncertainty

arose as to whether the 16th Respondent should be assessed by a Superior

in the Colombo Head office as the 16th Respondent was full time Trade

Union activist. As such Director Establishment had to be consulted,

through the Secretary to the Ministry of Postal Services, by letter of

08.10.2010 (2R3) by the former Postmaster General. In response the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs by letter of

November 2010 (2R4) gave directions to Secretary, Ministry of Postal

Services as to the steps that need to be taken.

I find on a perusal of the relevant affidavit the interview panel in

its first selection allocated marks for performance appraisal for only those who

had supporting documents and obtained as performance as excellent, and

not others who had not presented supporting documents. But as instructed

above the interview panel who sat for the second time on 22.03.2011 revised

the marks for performance appraisal even without supporting documents

8

provided performance as ‘excellent’, recommended by his superiors and

interview panel gave 15 marks, for all.

According to the first selection by the interview panel, candidates

were not given the full 15 marks unless he was able to support it with

documents. On that basis only one candidate namely H.M.A.G. Thillekeratne

(Serial No. 7) had been allocated 15 marks as he had been judged as excellent

and also had supporting documents. This position was changed on 22.03.20111

by the interview panel as stated above and all those who had the remark as

‘excellent’ for performance appraisal were given 15 marks. Therefore revision of

marks had taken place.

There is an annexure to the affidavit which is filed of record of the

Postmaster General who had been holding the post at the relevant period. A

chart marked and produced as 2R6 submitted with the affidavit demonstrate

the position of allocating marks to each candidate and the variation that had

taken place on the instructions of Secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration. The revision of marks resulted in the 1st Petitioner and the 2nd

Petitioner who was within the selection list as Nos 17 and 18 being shifted to

Nos 19 and 20, and the resulting position was that they were not finally selected.

It is also observed that the marks allocated to the two Petitioners were not

9

changed, (serial Nos. 1 & 9 of 2R6) at the subsequent meeting of the interview

panel.

In view of the matters stated above, it is necessary to consider the

case of the two Petitioners and the 16th and 17th Respondents, as regards the

revision of marks, due to directions given by the Secretary to Ministry of Public

Administration. I note the following as pleaded in the affidavit of the Acting

Postmaster General.

(a) At the interview held on 28.9.2010, the 1st Petitioner (Mr. Tikiribanda) had

been allocated a total of 15 marks for his ‘Performance’ for the two years

that were considered for the promotions i.e; 10 marks for the year 2008

on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘above average’ and 05 marks for

the year 2009, on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘satisfactory’. He

had obtained a total of 35 marks and was placed 18th according to the

original list prepared by the Interview Board.

(b) At the interview held on 28.09.2010, the 2nd Petitioner (Mr. Wijeratne)

had been allocated a total of 10 marks for his ‘Performance’ for the two

years that were considered for the promotions i.e; 05 marks for the year

2008 on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘satisfactory’ and 05 marks

for the year 2009 on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘satisfactory’.

He had obtained a total of 36 marks and was placed 17th according to the

original list prepared by the Interview Board.

(c) The marks allocated to the Petitioners as aforesaid, did not change at the

meeting held by the Interview Board on 22.03.2011,

(d) At the interview held on 04.10.2010, the 16th Respondent (Mr.

Weerasekera) had been allocated a total of 20 marks for his ‘Performance’

10

for the two years that were considered for the promotions i.e; 10 marks

for the year 2008 on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘above average’

and 10 marks for the year 2009, on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was

‘above average’. He had obtained a total of 34 marks and was jointly

placed 19th according to the original list prepared by the Interview Board

(e) At the interview held on 21.10.2010, the 17th Respondent (Mr.

Kankanamge) had been allocated a total of 15 marks for his ‘Performance’

for the two years that were considered for the promotions i.e; 10 marks

for the year 2008 on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was ‘above average’

and 05 marks for the year 2009 on the basis that the ‘Performance’ was

‘satisfactory’. He had obtained a total of 26 marks according to the

original list prepared by the Interview Board.

(f) However, going by the advice obtained from the Director General of

Establishments as aforesaid, the 16th Respondent had to be allocated 15

marks for each year (2008 and 2009) since his ‘Performance’ had to be

considered as ‘excellent’ and as such the total marks obtained by him

increased from 34 to 44.

(g) With regard to the 17th Respondent, it was found that there was a mistake

in the allocation of marks to him for ‘Performance’ i.e; he had been given

10 marks for the year 2008 on the basis that his Performance was ‘above

average’ when in fact it should have been 15 on the basis that that his

Performance was ‘excellent’. Further, it had also been found that his

assessment for the year 2009 had also been ‘excellent’ although it had

been taken mistakenly as ‘satisfactory’ and had to be allocated 15 marks

instead of 05. Therefore, these mistakes had been corrected and the 17th

Respondent has been allocated 30 marks for ‘Performance’ and his total

marks had increased from 26 to 41.

11

It is also stated in the above affidavit that the Interview Board had

to go through the marks allocated to all other candidates. The Board found

discrepancies in the allocation of marks of K.A. Gamini Prasanna (serial No. 10),

H.K. Kariyawasam (serial No. 12) and S.K. Meegama (serial No. 22). This position

has been explained and demonstrated in detail in paragraph 14(i) to (l) of the

above affidavit. The adjustment of marks are shown in the chart 2R6. It is also

observed that the results of the interview panel are not made public. It is the

Public Service Commission that ultimately make the appointments, having

considered the results of the interview along with its recommendation. The

Public Service Commission has approved the promotions in the manner stated

above. Several appointment letters are issued by the Public Service Commission

marked 2R7 (i) to (xviii).

The pleadings of the 16th and 17th Respondents stress on the point

that the application of the Petitioners are time barred. It is also stated that the

necessary parties are not before court. These Respondents are somewhat

critical of the role of the 1st Respondent and blame the 1st Respondent for the

issuance of documents P4 to P9, and that have acted in collusion with the

Petitioners. It is further pleaded that both the 16th and 17th Respondents are

entitled to be promoted in keeping with the scheme of promotion marked P2,

to the post of Unified Postal Service Grade ‘A’ Group III Segment ‘A’. The 16th

12

and 17th Respondents were promoted Segment ‘B’ of the above post on

18.10.2008 and had been appraised as Excellent for the years 2008 and 2009.

It is further clarified by the 16th and 17th Respondents that the

authorities concerned sought advice from the Director, Establishment and

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration as to how persons involved in Trade

Union activities should be assessed. It was clarified that it should act upon the

appraisals which are already made. Documents 16 R5 provides material in this

regard and appraisals for the year 2008 and 2009 were considered.

I have also considered the points suggested in the counter affidavit

of the two Petitioners. Though it is emphasised that the 16th & 17th Respondents

have acted in collusion with the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd to 15th Respondents

to obtain promotions in the postal service, I cannot find sufficient material to

support that contention. The mere statements and remarks made as regards

collusions with official Respondents is not acceptable to this court unless

supported with cogent reasons. It is not established nor can I come to the

conclusion that the 16th & 17th Respondents were able to influence the official

Respondents as the authority to explain matters of this nature would be the

Director Establishment and the Secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration. The persons in authority in this case were well aware of the

procedure to be adopted.

13

The Public Service Commission by letter dated 20.09.2011 and

marked 2R7 (i) to 2R7 (xviii) has promoted the persons named therein. This court

no doubt granted leave to proceed on 19.03.2012 and by that time the

candidate concerned were all promoted. This court did not think it fit to grant

any interim relief, at that point of time. The position of this case had been

adequately dealt in documents 2R1 to 2R6. The method adopted is spelt out

more particularly in 2R1 & 2R2. The marks given for performance appraisals are

considered in 2R1. It inter alia states that since doubts arose on marks to be

allocated to the 16th Respondent by the interview panel on performance

appraisal clarification was sought. 16th Respondent was involved in union

activities (full time). He was supervised by Galle Regional Superintendent and

Deputy Post Master General (South). Therefore Director, Establishment had to

be consulted. A change took place as advised by Director, Establishment and any

candidate who had been remarked as ‘excellent for performance appraisal was

given full marks (15 marks). This directive was applicable across the board to all

candidates and the interview panel had to comply with such directive. What sort

of changes that took place are discussed above.

A Government Servant is employed on terms which are offered to

him. His stay in the public service and promotions are all matters which are

regulated by the authorities concerned. That would not mean that his basic

14

fundamental rights are to be surrendered. A public servant is generally guided

by the Establishment Code which has a statutory flavour. There are circulars

issued by the Government which need to be carefully considered. State can

impose restrictions and regulations which are not arbitrary. Whatever

regulations, must conform to maintain the best standard for the public service.

In the case in hand the interview panel and the authorities concerned had to

verify the marks allocated on account of performance appraisals. As such the

Director, Establishment had to be consulted. The Director’s views and directions

had to prevail in the circumstances and necessary instructions were given by the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration. I cannot see anything serious to

interfere with such directions. As such this application stands dismissed without

costs.

Application dismissed.
