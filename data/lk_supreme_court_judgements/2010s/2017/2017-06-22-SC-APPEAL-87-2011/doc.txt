This is an appeal filed by the Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioners against the judgment

of the Court of Appeal dated 7.3.2011 wherein the Court of Appeal refused an

application of the Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner to charge the relevant persons for

contempt of Court of Appeal. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of

Appeal the Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioners have appealed to this court. This court

by its order dated 29.6.2011 granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in

paragraphs 10(a) to 10(h) of the petition dated 6.4.2011 which are set out below.

a. The Respondent Shipowners are not entitled in Admiralty Law and the rules

to seek any disbursement of the sales proceeds of the vessel, irrespective of

3

whether there is any Stay Order preventing such disbursement or any

undertaking by the vessel owners not to seek such disbursement. Such

disbursement could only be done upon the conclusion of all the connected

Actions inRem, which would also include the conclusion of the CA

(Revision) Application No. 45/2006 to set aside the Order dismissing the

Action in Rem No.1/2006, and thereafter, in terms of the Rules prescribed

under the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act giving rightful place to priorities.

b. The Respondent shipowners are not entitled to any proceeds of the sale of

the said vessel in view of the claims of the Judgment creditors in Action in

Rem No. 11/2005 (i.e. SLPA) and Action in Rem No. 15/2005 being greater

than the said sales proceeds of the said vessel, and in the event the

Petitioners succeed in CA (Revision) Application No. 45/2006, as the

Petitioners‟ claim for salvage services rendered to the vessel taking

precedence over all other claims, which claim is also greater than the said

sales proceeds.

c. The Power of Attorney Holder of the Respondent Shipowners had

surreptitiously obtained the release of the said moneys in Action in Rem No.

15/2005, by merely tendering a letter to the High Court Registry and without

notice to the other interested parties, including the Petitioners, who were

entitled in law to such notice, despite the fact that the said moneys were

lying in the connected Action in Rem No. 9/2005, and there were Orders by

the High Court (Vide the documents marked X1 and X2 to the document

marked Y2 hereinbefore) which clearly stated that no disbursement was to

be effected other than in terms of Rules laid down in the Admiralty

Jurisdiction law.

4

d. The pervious surreptitious applications by the Power of Attorney Holder of

the Respondent Shipowners to unilaterally obtain the release of the said sales

proceeds which culminated in the Order dated 11th December 2006 of the

Court of Appeal ( Vide: the document marked X3 to the SLPA‟s Motion

marked Y2) and that this Order was extended and/or reiterated by the Court

of Appeal on 6th February 2007 (Vide: the document marked X4 to the

SLPA‟s Motion marked Y2). And the fact that the Order dated 25th June

2008 of the Court of Appeal was made consequent to a further application

by the Power of Attorney holder of the Respondent shipowners seeking an

unlawful release of the sales proceed from the said Action inRem No. 9/2005

(Vide: the document marked HCR 1 (b) to the Petitioners‟ Motion marked

Y5 hereinbefore)

e. The firm undertaking given by Counsel in open Court on behalf of his

clients not to seek any disbursements pending the determination of this

matter in the Court of Appeal and acted upon by court and formally recorded

as an order of Court are not to be disregarded and in view of such

undertaking and the subsequent order of court there was no necessity to

formally support a stay order to prevent the disbursement of the sales

proceeds of the vessel. The Respondent shipowners through their Counsel

and Power of Attorney holders had been represented in Court on all

occasions when such undertakings were given or extended.

f. The non availability of the minutes of 6th February 2007 of the Hon. Court of

Appeal in CA (Revision) Application No. 45/2006, (wherein all Counsel had

given a firm undertaking not to seek the disbursement of the sales proceeds

5

of the said vessel) was a matter beyond the control of the Petitioners. Its non

availability should not have been decided to the disadvantage of the

Petitioners as,

i. Ex facie the Order dated 25th June 2008 of the Hon. Court of

Appeal (Vide: the document marked HCR 1 (b) to the

Petitioners‟ Motion marked Y5) clearly show that the Court

seem to have had the benefit of referring the said minutes of 6th

February 2007.

ii. The SLPA‟s Motion marked Y2 contains a certified copy of the

said minutes of 6th February 2007 (vide: the document marked

X4 thereto) issued by the Registry of the Court of Appeal.

g. The High Court and its Registrar had notice of all the relevant Orders and

undertakings in the Court of Appeal as regards the said matters and the High

Court and its Registrar could not have been unaware of the Petitioners‟

lawful concerns as to the safety of the sales proceeds of MV Jaami.

However, other than the filing of the High Court Registrar‟s Report in

Action in Rem No. 15/2005, confirming the removal of the said moneys by

the Power of Attorney holder of the Respondent shipowners, there was no

further action by the High Court to remedy the gross prejudice caused to the

interest of the Petitioners as well as the other claimants by the said unlawful

removal of moneys from the sales proceeds of the vessel.

h. The manifest conduct of the power of attorney holder of the Respondent

shipowners, in surreptitiously seeking and obtaining the release of the said

6

moneys, is at variance with the clear provision in the Admiralty law as to

priority of claims, and such conduct is an abuse of the process of Court and a

fraud perpetrated on Court.

In my view, there are no specific questions of law set out in the said paragraphs.

When submissions of counsel are considered, the most important question of law

that must be considered in this case can be stated as follows.

“When a party to an action violates an undertaking given to court by him, can such

party be charged for contempt of court.”

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Petitioners) filed action in Rem No.1/2006 in the High Court in the High Court of

Colombo seeking, inter alia, for an order of arrest and detention of Motor Vessel

MV JAAMI lying in the port of Colombo. The learned High Court Judge by her

judgment dated 28.2.2006 dismissed the action of the Plaintiff-Petitioners. Being

aggrieved by the judgment of the learned High Court Judge,the Plaintiff-Petitioners

on 15.3.2006 filed a Revision Application No.45/2006 in the Court of Appeal

seeking, inter alia, the following reliefs.

1. To act in revision and grant interim relief by issuing an interim order and

stay order staying the operation of the order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 28.2.2006.

2. To act in revision and grant interim relief by issuing an interim order and

stay order staying the disbursement of the sum of US$ 1,615,000/- credited

to the Admiralty Account of the High Court of Colombo, being the purchase

consideration of the said vessel (MV JAAMI) which is lying to the credit of

the Admiralty Account of the High Court of Colombo and arises from the

sale of the said vessel MV JAAMI until the final determination of the

Application in Revision.

7

3. To act in revision and set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 28.2.2006.

The Court of Appeal in Revision Application No.45/2006 made an interim order

on 6.2.2007 (marked as X4 in Y2) which reads as follows.

“All Counsel agree that they will not seek any disbursement of the sale proceeds of

MV JAAMI lying in the High Court without prejudice to the rights of parties to

proceed with the trial. As this order relates to 15/2005 and 11/2005, Registrar is

ordered to issue copy of this order to the Registrar of the High Court of Colombo.”

According to the order of the Court of Appeal dated 25.6.2008, the

Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal on 7.2.2007 had communicated the said

order to the Registrar of the High Court of Colombo.

The Court of Appeal on 25.6.2008 in Revision Application No.45/2006 made

a further order (marked as X5 in Y2) which reads as follows. On this day all parties

were represented by their lawyers.

“In accordance with the order dated on 6.2.2007 as stated earlier all counsel

agreed that they would not seek any disbursement of the sale proceeds of MV

JAAMI lying in the High Court without prejudice to the rights of parties to proceed

with the trial as this order relates to 15/2005 and 11/2005. As the Registrar of this

court has already issued a copy of this order to the Registrar of the High Court of

Colombo, this court is of the firm belief that the aforesaid order made by this court

should not be violated unless a contrary order is made by a Superior Court. As this

matter is pending before this court, the Registrar is directed to inform the Registrar

of the High Court that any application pertaining to the disbursement of the sale

proceeds should not be entertained pending the application before this court.”

When the above orders were in operation PPJ Hewawasam, the Power of

Attorney holder of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the 2nd Defendant-Respondent made an application to the High Court to

8

release US$ 337,553 from the sale proceeds of vessel MV JAAMI. The High Court

ordered the release of the money and as a result of the said order, PPJ Hewawasam,

the Power of Attorney holder of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent received

Rs.33983850/95 (cheque No.648824). It appears that PPJ Hewawasam, the Power

of Attorney holder of the2nd Defendant-Respondent has made the above application

to the High Court for the release of the money when the orders of the Court of

Appeal dated 6.2.2007 and 25.6.2008 were in operation. It appears from the said

orders of the Court of Appeal that on 6.2.2007 and 25.6.2008 the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent had been represented in the Court of Appeal by counsel and that both

orders had been communicated to the High Court (vide document marked CR1a).

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Petitioners contended that the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent and or his Power of Attorney holder had committed contempt of Court

of Appeal when the said application for the release of money was made to the High

Court on 18.12.2009.The Plaintiff-Petitioners filed papers in the Court of Appeal

alleging thatthe 2nd Defendant-Respondent and or his Power of Attorney holder

had committed contempt of Court of Appeal when the said application for the

release of money was made to the High Court on 18.12.2009. The Court of

Appeal,after hearing submissions of both parties on the said application of

thePlaintiff-Petitioners, delivered its judgment on 7.3.2011. The Court of Appeal

by its judgment dated 7.3.2011 decided that the order of the Court of Appeal dated

25.6.2008 was a per-incuriam order and therefore refused to inquire into the

charges of contempt of court. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Petitioners

contended that the said judgment of the Court of Appeal was wrong. I now advert

to this contention. The Court of Appeal by its order dated 25.6.2008 (marked as X5

in Y2) observed that all counsel on 6.2.2007 had agreed not to seek any

disbursement of the sale proceeds of MV JAAMI lying in the High Court.The

Court of Appeal in the said order dated 25.6.2008 also observed that the order of

9

the Court of Appeal dated 6.2.2007 should not be violated by the parties. When

this order made on 25.6.2008 was in operation how did the Power of Attorney

holder of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent made an application on 18.12.2009 to get

the money released from the sale proceeds of M.V. JAAMI lying in the High

Court. He received Rs.33983850/95 from the sale proceeds of M.V. JAAMI. When

I consider the above matters, it appears that there is material to consider that the 2nd

Defendant-Respondent and/or his Power of Attorney holder had committed the

offence of contempt of Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal by its order dated 7.3.2011, decided that order of the

Court of Appeal dated 25.6.2008 was a per-incuriam order and that therefore

refused to inquire into the charge ofcontempt of Court of Appeal. When the Power

of Attorney holder of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent made the above application on

18.12.2009, was there any declaration by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the

order of the Court of Appeal dated 25.6.208 was a per-incuriam order. The answer

is in the negative. Party to an action cannot decide that an order of court is a per-

incuriam order. Such a decision must be made by court and if such an order was

made by court. It is the duty of court to vacate it. When I consider the above

matters, I am of the view that there is material to consider that the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent and/or his Power of Attorney holder had violated the order of the

Court of Appeal dated 25.6.2008. In this connection I would like to consider a

judicial decision. In De Alwis Vs Rajakaruna 68 NLR 180 this court observed the

following facts.

“According to the terms of an interim settlement recorded by court in an action

the plaintiff agreed to hand over certain motor vehicles (tractors) and undertook

not to make use of them. The plaintiff however failed to honour his undertaking.”

This Court held as follows.

10

“The plaintiff was guilty of contempt of court. The failure of a party to honour an

undertaking given by him to court is a contempt of court.”

When a party to an action gives an undertaking to court, it becomes his

duty to implement it. When a party fails to honour an undertaking given to court,

such party is guilty of contempt of court.The 2nd Defendant-Respondent has failed

to honour the undertaking given by him to court when his Power of Attorney

holder made the application to court on 18.12.2009 to release money from the sale

proceeds of vesselM.V. JAAMI.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the Court of Appeal was

wrong when it, by judgment dated 7.3.2011, decided not to initiate an inquiry or

issue charges for contempt of Court of Appeal. In my view there is material against

the 2nd Defendant-Respondent and/or his Power of Attorney holder to consider

contempt charges. For the above reasons, I set aside the judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 7.3.2011 and direct the Court of Appeal to rehear the case.

The Plaintiff-Petitioners in their application filed in this court has also

sought the following relief.

“Order the 2nd Defendant-Respondent and/or his Power of Attorney holder PPJ

Hewawasam to forthwith return the sum of Rs.33,983,850/95 received by him on

22.12.2009.”

It has to be noted here that in the Revision Application 45/2006 filed in the

Court of Appeal, the Plaintiff-Petitioners had not sought such a relief. His appeal to

this court was against the judgment dated 7.3.2011 wherein the Court of Appeal

refused to consider charges of contempt of Court of Appeal.The Court of Appeal

by the said judgment has not considered the granting or refusing of the said relief.

Therefore it is not proper for me to consider granting of the said relief. I therefore

refused to consider the said prayer.

11

For the aforementioned reasons, I set aside the judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 7.3.2011 and direct the Court of Appeal to rehear the application for

contempt of court filed by the Plaintiff-Petitioners.

Rehearing ordered.
