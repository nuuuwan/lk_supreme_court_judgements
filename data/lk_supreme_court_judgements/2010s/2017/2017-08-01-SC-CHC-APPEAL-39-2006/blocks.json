The defendants agreed to pay, to the plaintiff, as rent for the lease of the vehicle, an aggregate sum of Rs. 2,865,540/- in 60 monthly rentals of Rs.47,759/- each. They also agreed to pay interest at 23.725% per annum on any delayed payments. It was agreed that, the plaintiff was entitled to terminate the Lease Agreement if the defendants failed to pay any monthly rental within seven days of it becoming due for payment. It was also agreed that, upon such termination, the defendants shall pay, to the plaintiff, the arrears of rentals together with any accrued interest and also the rentals that fall due from the date of termination onwards. Further, the defendants promised to return the vehicle to the plaintiff if the Lease Agreement was terminated and agreed that, the plaintiff was entitled to retake possession of the vehicle if the defendants did not return it. The plaintiff states that, the defendants paid only the first monthly rental but made no further payments thereafter. The plaintiff states that, therefore, the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement and demanded that the defendants pay all the monies due under the Lease Agreement and return the vehicle. However, the defendants did not pay any monies to the plaintiff. On 04th May 2001, the plaintiff instituted this action against the 1st and 2nd defendants in the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo and exercising Commercial [Civil] Jurisdiction, praying for the recovery of the monies said to be due to the plaintiff from the 1st and 2nd defendants under and in terms of the Lease Agreement. The 3rd and 4th defendants abovenamed were also joined as defendants on the basis that they were liable to pay these monies as guarantors. However, at the trial, the plaintiff did not proceed against the 3rd and 4th defendants. As set out in the plaint, the plaintiff\u2019s case against the 1st and 2nd defendants was, in brief, that: the plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd defendants entered into the aforesaid Lease Agreement; the defendants failed and neglected to pay the monthly rentals due to the plaintiff thereunder; therefore, the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement; the plaintiff demanded payment of the monies due under the Lease Agreement and the return of the vehicle; the 1st and 2nd defendants did not pay the monies that were demanded; therefore, a Cause of Action has accrued to the plaintiff to sue the defendants to recover the sum of Rs.4,218,798/50 said to be due and owing as at 17th August 2000 upon the Lease Agreement, together with interest at 24% per annum from 18th August 2000 onwards on a sum of Rs.2,770,022/-, as set out in the Statement of Account filed with the plaint marked \u201cB\u201d. In their answer dated 30th September 2001, the 1st and 2nd defendants denied liability to pay these monies. When the case was taken up for trial on 03rd December 2003, the defendants moved to amend their answer. The plaintiff objected. By an Order dated 25th April 2005, the learned trial judge refused the defendants\u2019 application to",

It is relevant to mention here that, in this answer, the defendants did not claim that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated. As a matter of interest, the proposed amended answer tendered by the defendants also did not include an averment to that effect. On the next trial date, the plaintiff framed seven issues which, in essence, were: (a) whether the 1st and 2nd defendants agreed to the terms and conditions set out in the Lease Agreement ?; (b) whether the defendants failed to pay the monthly rentals due thereunder ?; (c) whether the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement ?; (d) whether the sum prayed for in the plaint is due and owing from the defendants upon the Lease Agreement ?; whether the defendants failed to pay these monies to the plaintiff ?; (e) and whether, if the aforesaid issues are answered in the affirmative, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as prayed for in the plaint ? The 1st and 2nd defendants framed four issues. These issues were, in essence: (a) whether the Lease Agreement cannot be admitted in evidence for the reason that it has not been duly stamped ?; (b) whether the Statement of Account filed with the plaint marked \u201cB\u201d was incorrect ? and (c) whether, if the aforesaid issues are answered in the defendants\u2019 favour, the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed ? The defendants did not frame an issue on whether the Lease Agreement had been frustrated On the same day, learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd defendants objected to the admission of the Lease Agreement in evidence at the trial, on the ground that it had not been duly stamped. Learned counsel for the plaintiff moved for time to verify whether the Lease Agreement had been duly stamped. On the next date of trial, counsel submitted that, the Lease Agreement had been duly stamped. Thereafter, an officer of the plaintiff bank gave evidence on the lines of the plaint and produced the documents marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d. During the cross examination of this witness, the 1st and 2nd defendants produced several letters exchanged between the plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd defendants and the Supplier, marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d to \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d. The plaintiff closed its case after this witness completed his evidence. The 1st defendant gave evidence and produced more letters exchanged between the plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd defendants and Sathosa Motors [\u201cthe Supplier\u201d], marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd26\u201d to \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd211\u201d. The defendants did not call any other witnesses and closed their case leading in evidence, the documents marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d to \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd211\u201d. The parties tendered written submissions. The learned trial judge delivered judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. In his judgment, the learned trial judge discussed the pleadings and the issues raised by the parties and then stated that, there was ample evidence which established that defects in the vehicle prevented the defendants from paying the",

When considering the evidence relevant to the two additional issues, the learned trial judge stated that, the plaintiff\u2019s witness testified at p.19 of the proceedings of 08th February 2005 that, the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated while the vehicle was being driven \u2013 \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0dd3 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 `\u0dc0\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dc0 \u0dcf\u0db8\u0da9\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dd9\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u2019 \u0db1\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca, \u0dc0\u0db8\u0db8 \u0db1\u0da9\u0dd4\u0dd9\u0da7 \u0d85\u0dd9\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd9 \u0db6\u0daf\u0dca\u0dd9\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0daf\u0dca\u0db4\u0dc5 \u0dd9\u0db1 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0db0\u0dcf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dba \u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dae\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd3 \u0dc0\u0db6\u0dcf\u0da9\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dc3 \u0da0\u0dd0\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd3 \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db6\u0dd9 \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dc1 \u0d9a\u0dbb \u0d87\u0dad (\u0d92 \u0dc3\u0db3 \u0dcf \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 2005 \u0dc0\u0db4\u0db6\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd2 08 \u0dd9\u0db1 \u0daf\u0dd2\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0da7 \u0db1\u0dca \u0dd9\u0dbd 19 \u0dd9\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dd9)\u201d. The learned judge goes on to mention that, the 1st defendant said that the vehicle could not be used due to numerous defects in the vehicle and that the letters marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d produced by the 1st and 2nd defendants establish that, there were numerous defects in the vehicle. The learned judge also says that, the letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d establishes that the plaintiff was ready to take the vehicle back due to these defects. The learned trial judge then concludes that, there was clear evidence that, the vehicle separated into two, which indisputably established that the vehicle could not be used \u2013 \u201c\u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0db6\u0dbb\u0db4\u0dad\u0dbd \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0ddd\u0dc2 \u0dd9\u0dbd\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2 \u0dc0\u0dd3 \u0d87\u0dad. \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dc1\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dc0\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0db1\u0dca\u0db0\u0dc0\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab \u0db4\u0dd0 \u0dd0\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0 \u0dc5\u0dd2\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dca \u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca, \u0d91\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da0\u0dca\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2 \u0db6\u0dd9 \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dd9\u0db8\u0db1\u0dcf\u0dba \u201d. Having made the aforesaid observations with regard to the evidence, the learned trial judge states that, the condition of the vehicle was such that it could not be used and concludes that, therefore, the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d had been frustrated. After concluding that the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d had been frustrated, the learned trial judge briefly considered the evidence with regard to the sum claimed by the plaintiff. The learned judge was of the view that the plaintiff had satisfactorily explained the amounts set out in the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and that",

    "text": "there was no reason why the High Court should not accept the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness in this regard. However, the learned trial judge mentions that, there was no need to closely examine these amounts since the Court had previously held that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated. With regard to the defendants\u2019 claim that the Lease Agreement had not been duly stamped, the learned trial judge observed that neither party had produced a Gazette which set out the Stamp Duty which was payable. Here too, the learned trial judge mentions that, there was no need to further examine this issue in view of the Court\u2019s determination that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated. The learned trial judge then proceeded to answer, in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, the plaintiff\u2019s issues with regard to whether the 1st and 2nd defendants had agreed to the terms and conditions set out in the Lease Agreement but failed to pay the monthly rentals due from them and whether the Lease Agreement had been terminated. However, presumably in view of the determination that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated, the High Court answered, in the negative, the plaintiff\u2019s other issues with regard to whether the monies claimed in the plaint are due and owing from the defendants to the plaintiff upon the Lease Agreement and whether the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the 1st and 2nd defendants. Thereafter, the learned trial judge has answered the defendants\u2019 issues with regard to the alleged inaccuracy of the Statement of Account and the alleged lack of due stamping of the Lease Agreement, against the defendants. Since the learned trial judge had, earlier on in the judgment, taken the view that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated, he answered the two additional issue no.s [12] and [13] in the affirmative and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s case, with costs. It is immediately clear that, the central questions to be decided in this appeal are: firstly, whether the learned trial judge erred when he framed the two additional issues at the stage of judgment and immediately proceeded to answer these two issues; and secondly, whether in any event, the learned trial judge erred when he answered those two additional issues in the affirmative. With regard to the first question, although section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code was not cited in the judgment of the High Court, it is apparent that, the learned trial judge was relying on section 149 as giving the Court authority to frame the two additional issue no.s [12] and [13]. Section 149 states, \u201cThe court may, at any time before passing a decree, amend the issue or frame additional issues on such terms as it thinks fit\u201d. No doubt, this provision permits a trial judge to frame additional issues at any time before passing the decree if he is of the view that such additional issues are required to enable the Court to arrive at \u201cthe right decision of the case\u201d in terms of section 146 of the Civil Procedure Code. However, unlike section 146 which gives clear pointers to the procedure to be followed when framing issues at the commencement of the trial, section 149 is silent on the procedure to be followed when a trial judge decides, in the course of a trial, that additional issues are necessary.",

During the course of his judgment, the District Judge framed an additional issue on whether the plaintiff could have and maintain the action in view of the provisions of section 22 (7) of the Rent Act. The plaintiff appealed. In appeal, counsel for the plaintiff contended that, the District Court was not entitled to raise an additional issue at the stage of judgment.

It is not necessary that the new issue should arise on the pleadings. A new issue could be framed on the evidence led by the parties orally or in the form of documents.

    "text": "I would, with respect, entirely agree with this cautionary restriction which Ranaraja J placed on the exercise of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to frame additional issues at the stage of judgment. This restriction is necessary since the scope and ambit of the trial had been defined by the admissions and issues which were framed at the commencement of the trial, in terms of section 146 of the Civil Procedure Code. The parties are only aware of those issues and have presented their cases for adjudication, based on those issues. Those admissions and issues have identified and mapped what the parties believed was the battle field on which they are to contest the trial. In STATE OF GUJARAT vs. JAIPALSINGH JASWANTSING ENGINEERS AND CONTRACTORS [1994 1 Guj. LR 258 at 261], Vaidya J in the High Court of Gujarat used a different metaphor to make a similar observation and said \u201c\u2026.. issues are backbone of a suit. They are also the lamp-post which enlightens the parties to the proceedings, the trial court and even the appellate court \u2013 as to what is the controversy, what is evidence and where lies the way to truth and justice.\u201d. Therefore, a trial judge who intends to frame additional issues at the time of judgment, must be conscious of the fact that the framing of these additional issues may result in the case being decided on issues the parties did not contemplate when they led evidence. To use the metaphors mentioned earlier, the additional issues could shift the battle to a new field which the parties had not been asked to march upon or push the contest to an alley which had not been lit by the issues the parties could see. Thus, while a trial judge does have the discretion to frame additional issues at the stage of judgment, that is a discretion which would, usually, be exercised sparingly and only in circumstances where it is necessary to do so to ensure that justice is done and the correct decision is reached by the Court. Other than in such circumstances, additional issues would not be raised at the stage of judgment. Thus, in JASRAJ FAOJI vs. MT. SUGRABAI [AIR 30 1943 Sind 242], the Sind Chief Court recognised that a Court should, usually, refrain from framing new issues after the parties had closed their cases. Davis CJ stated [at p. 243-244] \u201cNow, the procedure adopted by the learned Judge in resettling issues after the evidence was led and the arguments in large part heard, was not, we think, the correct procedure.\u201d. Similarly, in the case of NAGUBAI AMMAL vs. B.SHAMA RAO [1956 AIR SC 593 at p.598] decided by the Supreme Court of India, Venkatarama Ayyar J stated, \u201cThe true scope of the rule is that evidence let in on issues on which the parties actually went to trial should not be made the foundation for decision of another and different issue, which was not present to the minds of the parties and on which they had no opportunity of adducing evidence.\u201d.",

    "text": "that issue and make submissions thereon. The preparation of the judgment may be resumed only after these steps are concluded. Ranaraja J expressed similar views in HAMEED vs. CASSIM [at p.33] when His Lordship stated, \u201c\u2026.. the Judge must ensure that when it is considered necessary to hear parties to arrive at the right decision on the new issue, that they be permitted to lead fresh evidence or if it is purely a question of law, that they be afforded an opportunity to make submissions thereon.\u201d A Court has ample jurisdiction to follow this procedure. In fact, section 165 of the Civil Procedure Code permits a Court to recall any witness \u201cwhenever in the course of the trial it thinks it necessary for the ends of justice to do so.\u201d While considering the comparable provision in India, the Delhi High Court in SURESH KUMAR vs. BALDEV [AIR 1984 439] stated that, a Court has the discretion to recall a witness at any stage before the judgment is pronounced. In MADUBHAI AMTHALAL vs. AMTHALAL NANALAL [AIR 1947 156], the Bombay High Court held that, a Court which is considering its judgment may recall a witness to clear up an ambiguity or omission. In any event, quite apart from section 165 which permits a Court to call a witness at any stage, there is no provision in our Civil Procedure Code which expressly prohibits or militates against a trial judge hearing evidence and submissions on additional issues which are framed at the time he is preparing the judgment. Therefore, a Court will also have the inherent power to adopt this procedure to achieve the ends of justice, in terms of section 839 of the Code. In this connection, it hardly needs to said that, a failure on the part of the trial judge to take these precautions will cause grave injustice. Further, a trial judge who fails to give the parties an opportunity to lead evidence on and be heard on additional issues raised in the judgment, will be ignoring the audi alteram partem rule. Finally, for the sake of completeness, it should also be mentioned that, there may be some limited instances in which, because the record makes it manifestly clear that the facts and law underpinning additional issues which are raised at the time of judgment, were at the forefront of the minds of both parties at the trial and that both parties were fully aware of the need to lead evidence and address the law on matters relating to those additional issues, a Court has the discretion to proceed to answer those additional issues without suspending the preparation of the judgment and giving the parties a further opportunity to be heard on those additional issues. This limited exception was referred to by Venkatarama Ayyar J in NAGUBAI AMMAL vs. B.SHAMA RAO, when the learned Judge, having outlined the general rule cited above, went on to mention, [at p.598], \u201cBut that rule has no application to a case where the parties go to trial with knowledge that a particular question is in issue, though no specific issue has been framed thereon, and adduce relating evidence thereto.\u201d. SUNDERSINGH vs. RAJARAM [AIR 1991 MP 59] and AGRAWALLA vs. BHARAT COKING COAL LIT [AIR 1989 SC 1530] are other decisions where this exception was referred to. However, this limited exception will apply only where it is indisputably clear from the record that, both parties were fully aware that the questions raised in the additional issues framed in the judgment, were in issue at the",

    "text": "trial but the parties have omitted to proceed to frame specific issues thereon. It is fitting to reiterate and emphasise that, the general rule is that parties must be given an opportunity to be heard on additional issues framed at the time of judgment. When the principles set out above are applied to the present case, it is clear that, the two additional issues framed in the judgment regarding whether the Lease Agreement had been frustrated, were issues of both fact and law. It is also clear from a perusal of the evidence that, a claim that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated had not been expressly put to the plaintiff\u2019s witness and had not been expressly made by the 1st defendant when he testified. Further, the proceedings establish that, a question whether the Lease Agreement had been frustrated was not specifically raised or considered during the course of the trial before the parties closed their cases and the case was reserved for judgment. Thus, the plaintiff cannot be said to have been aware that a question of whether the Lease Agreement was frustrated, was in issue. This is not a case falling within the limited exception described earlier and referred to by Venkatarama Ayyar J in NAGUBAI AMMAL vs. B.SHAMA RAO. Despite these circumstances, the learned trial judge has answered the two additional issues on frustration of the Lease Agreement, which were framed by him at the time the judgment was written, without giving the parties an opportunity to lead evidence on these two additional issues or to make submissions thereon. That has caused injustice to the plaintiff who, as entitled to, had presented its case guided by the eleven issues framed by the parties at the commencement of the trial, which did not include an issue on whether the Lease Agreement had been frustrated. Further, since a claim that the Lease Agreement had been frustrated had not been raised or considered during the trial, the plaintiff had no cause to think that there would be any issue for determination with regard to whether the Lease Agreement had been frustrated or to lead evidence or make submissions on that question. The plaintiff was entitled to have believed that, the High Court would deliver its judgment in conformity with De Silva CJ\u2019s observation in HANAFFI vs. NALLAMA [1998 1 SLR 73 at p.77] that, \u201c\u2026.. once issues are framed, the case which the court has to hear and determine become crystallized in the issues.\u201d. In these circumstances, the failure of the High Court to give an opportunity to the parties to present evidence and be heard on the two additional issues framed at the stage of writing the judgment, has caused a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, these two additional issue no.s [12] and [13] must be struck out by this Court and, the answers to these two issues, must be set aside. Although the two additional issues have been struck out by this Court, it is, nevertheless, incumbent on this Court to examine whether there was sufficient evidence to indicate that the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d had been frustrated. This has to be done since, the existence of such evidence may require this case to be sent back to the High Court to determine an issue on frustration of the Lease Agreement, after the parties are given an opportunity to be heard on that issue.",

    "text": "In this regard, a perusal of the judgment makes it clear that, the learned trial judge relied heavily on the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witness at p.19 of the proceedings of 08th February 2005, when the High Court reached the conclusion that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated. However, a reading of the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness shows that, the witness has not admitted that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated. Instead, what occurred was that, while this witness was being cross examined by the learned counsel for the defendants, he was shown the letter dated 13th January 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d written by the defendants and asked whether it states that the chassis and the body of the vehicle has separated while it was being driven. The witness has replied stating that such a claim is made in the letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d but, the witness has not admitted the truth of that claim - vide: the following evidence at p.19 of the proceedings of 08th February 2005 soon after the letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d, which stated \u201cAt 9.00 a.m. the said bus broke down at Avissawella with the body separating from the chassis with the passenger load luckily no casualties.\u201d, was shown to the plaintiff\u2019s witness: \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb: \u0d92 \u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0db6\u0db1\u0dd9\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0db8\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dca\u0db6\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4 \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0db8\u0dca \u0db8\u0dad \u0dbd\u0db6\u0dcf \u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad \u0dd9\u0dcf \u0db1\u0dba \u0d86\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dd4 \u0dd9\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0db1\u0dca\u0db0\u0dd9 ? \u0d8b : \u0d94\u0dc0\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb: \u0dad\u0dd9 \u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0da7\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0db6\u0db1\u0dd9\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0db8\u0dca \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0db0\u0dcf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dae\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dc0\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd3 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dc0\u0dda \u0dc0\u0db6\u0dcf\u0da9\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dc3 \u0da0\u0dd0\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dcf? \u0d8b : \u0d94\u0dc0\u0dca. This evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness only establishes that the defendants claimed in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated while the vehicle was being driven. This evidence does not establish the truth of that claim or that the plaintiff admitted that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated. With regard to the 1st defendant\u2019s evidence, apart from making a claim in the aforesaid letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated and a similar claim when the 1st defendant gave evidence, the defendants did not adduce any reliable material to prove that such an incident occurred. Further, in their subsequent letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d, the defendants have modified the aforesaid claim made in their first letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201dand have stated \u201cAt about 9.00 a.m. the bus broke down at Avissawella with the body almost separating from the chassis,\u201d [emphasis added by me]. There is a significant difference between the claim made in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and the claim made in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d. The inference is that the first claim was exaggerated. Further, in both letters, the defendants say that, \u201cThe bus was brought down to Colombo\u2026.\u201d . This would suggest that the vehicle was capable of being driven back to Colombo or, at worst, being towed back to Colombo. It is highly unlikely that a vehicle which is \u201calmost separating\u201d as claimed in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d, can be driven or even towed on a highway. In these circumstances, it can be reasonably inferred that, the second claim in the letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d was also in the nature of an exaggeration. In any event, the defendants have admitted that, the alleged defect they referred to in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d was repaired and that, thereafter, the defendants used the vehicle on the Colombo-Badulla route. Thus, in their letter dated 27th May 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d, the defendants state, \u201cAfter the bus was repaired and handed to me,",

    "text": "we operated it on the Colombo-Badulla route\u2026..\u201d. Further, if the chassis and the body of the vehicle had, in fact, separated while the vehicle was being driven, the defendants would have had ample evidence such as police entries, the driver\u2019s evidence and repair estimates to prove the occurrence of an event of that nature. The inability of the defendants to produce any such evidence, casts substantial doubt on the claim made by them. For these reasons I am not inclined to place much credence on the defendants\u2019 claim that the chassis and the body of the vehicle had separated. Next, it is useful to examine the letters marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d to \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd211\u201d produced by the defendants. These letters have been marked and produced out of their chronological order. The result of this stratagem is that these letters do not present a clear picture at first glance. Perhaps, that was inadvertent. On the other hand, it may smack of a deliberate ploy to create a measure of confusion. Either way, an examination of these letters marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d to \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd211\u201d in the order in which they were written, reveals the history of this transaction. When these letters are looked at in chronological order, it is seen that the defendants had paid the first monthly rental in December 1997. Thereafter, the vehicle broke down in Avissawella on 11th January 1998 and was returned to the manufacturer for repairs. The defendants then wrote their letter dated 13th January 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d, asking the plaintiff to give them an extension of time to pay the second monthly rental. Thereafter, by their letter dated 16th February 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd26\u201d, defendants requested the plaintiff to reschedule the payment of the monthly rentals since the defendants claimed that the vehicle was not fit to ply the Colombo- Badulla route and had to be, instead, used on short distance routes. Next, by their letter dated 02nd March 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d, the defendants have stated that the vehicle needs extensive repairs and have offered to return the vehicle to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has replied by its letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d [the date is not legible] and letter dated 06th March 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd27\u201d, inviting the defendants to a discussion with regard to the defendants\u2019 request. After that discussion, the defendants have written their letters dated 25th March 1998 and 27th May 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d and \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd29\u201d stating that they had handed over the vehicle to the manufacturer on 23rd March 1998 and requested the plaintiff to make a new vehicle available to the defendants, but that a new vehicle has not been provided. This evidence establishes that, prior to the defendants handing over the vehicle to the manufacturer on 23rd March 1998, the defendants were using the vehicle. Thus, the defendants\u2019 letter dated 02nd March 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d reveals that the defendants were plying the vehicle on the Chilaw-Kurunegala route while the defendants\u2019 letters dated 16th February 1998 and 25th March 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd26\u201d and \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd28\u201d state that the defendants had been plying the vehicle on \u201cshort distance routes\u201d. After the defendants handed the vehicle to the manufacturer on 23rd March 1998, the manufacturer completed the repairs to the vehicle and wrote its letter dated 01st",

    "text": "July 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd210\u201d to the defendants, notifying that the vehicle had been repaired and is now \u201cin very good running condition\u201d and requesting the defendants to collect the vehicle. It is apparent from the evidence that, the defendants took delivery of the repaired vehicle. In this connection, the 1st defendant has stated \u201c\u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dd9 \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0dbd\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd4\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dae\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dc0\u0dca 1998.07.27 \u0dd9\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0dd2\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0dda \u0db6\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dae\u0dba \u0db6\u0dcf\u0dbb \u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca.\u201d The reasonable assumption is that the defendants commenced using the vehicle after that. The defendants have not led any evidence to the contrary. However, the defendants have not paid a single monthly rental after they paid the first rental in December 1997. It was in these circumstances that, the plaintiff sent the Letter of Termination dated 17th August 1998 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd04\u201d terminating the Lease Agreement and demanding payment of the monies due thereunder. The defendants replied by their letter dated 29th August 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd211\u201d denying liability to pay any monies to the plaintiff. Later, there was a further discussion between the parties after which the plaintiff wrote its letter dated 13th October 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d stating that, the plaintiff will release the defendants from all liabilities under the Lease Agreement if the defendants returned the vehicle. The defendants then wrote their letter dated 15th October 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd25\u201d addressed to the manufacturer and copied to the plaintiff, stating that the defendants would hand over the vehicle to the manufacturer. But, the defendants did not return the vehicle. Thus, the defendants chose not to make use of the plaintiff\u2019s offer, made in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d, to release the defendants from their liabilities under the Lease Agreement provided the defendants hand over the vehicle. Instead, the defendants chose to continue to use the vehicle after it was repaired and handed over to them on 27th July 1998. It was in these circumstances and long after the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement on 17th August 1998 by the letter marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 4\u201d that, the plaintiff repossessed the vehicle in March 1999 and instituted this action for the recovery of the balance monies due under the Lease Agreement. Next, to consider the defects in the vehicle, the letters written by the defendants refer to the vehicle breaking down on 11th January 1998 after which is was repaired and returned to the defendants. The letters also refer to defects in the lights, the front and rear windscreens not being properly fixed, repairs to the front hub, oil leaks, and defects in the front shock absorbers. These are all defects which can be repaired. As mentioned earlier, the evidence is that, these defects were repaired and the vehicle was handed back to the defendants on 27th July 1998. The evidence indicates that the defendants continued to use the vehicle after that. In these circumstances, it is not possible to reasonably conclude that, the defects in the vehicle rendered the vehicle unusable. Weeramantry [Law of Contract, para 791] commenting on instances where a contract may be frustrated by the destruction or damage to the subject matter of the contract, states, \u201cFor this purpose, it is not necessary that there should be a total or",

    "text": "complete destruction of subject matter of the contract. It is sufficient, if the subject matter is affected in such a way that the main purpose of the contract is defeated or cannot be performed. Thus even where there is an impairment or destruction not of the entirety but of some attribute or quality which is essential to the particular contract, the contract is discharged in the same way for the reason that performance is impossible.\u201d. When this principle is applied to the present case, it has to be kept in mind that, the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants was nothing more than a contract by which the plaintiff leased the vehicle to the 1st and 2nd defendants subject to the \u201cterms, covenants and conditions\u201d set out in the Lease Agreement. The vehicle was the subject matter of the contract. The evidence establishes that, the defects in the vehicle were repaired and the vehicle [ie: the subject matter of the contract] was usable. In fact, the defendants themselves have said that they were using the vehicle on the Chilaw-Kurunegala route and \u201cshort distance routes\u201d. The Lease Agreement did not contain any term or condition specifying a specific route that the vehicle was required to ply on or make it a condition of the Lease Agreement that the vehicle must be able to ply the Colombo-Badulla route. Thus, evidence establishes the subject matter of the contract [ie: the vehicle] was not affected in a manner which prevented the performance of the Lease Agreement. Accordingly, upon an application of the principle set out by Weeramantry, the Lease Agreement cannot be considered to have been frustrated. The learned trial judge appears to have also taken the view that, the plaintiff\u2019s letter dated 13th October 1998 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d establishes that, the plaintiff was willing to take the vehicle back because the plaintiff had recognized that defects in the vehicle made it unusable. However, with great respect to the learned judge, I am unable to agree that such a conclusion can be correctly drawn. This letter was written after the Lease Agreement was terminated and before the plaintiff repossessed the vehicle. By this letter, the plaintiff has only stated that, if the defendants hand over the vehicle, the plaintiff will release the defendants from their liability to pay the balance monies payable under the Lease Agreement, which had been demanded by the Letter of Termination marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd04\u201d. The plaintiff has gone to specify in \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d that the monies paid till then by the defendants, will not be refunded. Thus, in the light of the history of this transaction, it is clear that \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d is a letter by which the plaintiff offered a concession to the defendants in terms of which the plaintiff offered to release the defendants from their liability to pay the balance monies payable under the Lease Agreement provided the defendants return the vehicle as demanded the Letter of Termination marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd04\u201d. Presumably, if the defendants had returned the vehicle as requested by \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d, the plaintiff could have sold the vehicle and recovered all or most of the balance monies which were then due under the Lease Agreement. However, as stated earlier, the defendants did not make use of this concession offered by the plaintiff and did not return the vehicle. Thus, the letter marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d cannot be regarded as evidence that the plaintiff had recognised that the contract was frustrated.",

    "text": "Further, it is necessary to mention the established principle that, where parties to a contract make an express provision with regard to the party who is to bear the risk of the occurrence of a specified event, the occurrence of that event will not result in the frustration of the contract, unless there is supervening illegality. Thus, Weeramantry [Law of Contract, para 793] states, \u201cThe parties are at liberty to make express provision in the contract for allocating the risk of unforeseen events. Where such provision is made, the risk of unforeseen events will be borne by the party who undertakes it in terms of the contract, and the contract is not deemed frustrated by the happening of the event expressly provided for.\u201d. When the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d is examined in the light of this principle, it is seen that, Clause 3 of the Lease Agreement specifies that, the defendants shall be responsible \u201cfor the selection of the Supplier\u201d of the vehicle \u201cand all other matters on connection with the obtaining and use of\u201d of the vehicle [which the defendants requested the plaintiff to purchase and then lease to the defendants under the Lease Agreement]. In fact, when he gave evidence, the 1st defendant admitted that he chose the vehicle after examining it. Thereafter, Clause 4.1 of the Lease Agreement, places the onus on the defendants to \u201cinspect\u201d the vehicle before issuing the Acceptance Receipt. The 1st defendant has signed the Acceptance Receipt marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d by which he stated, inter alia, that, the defendants acknowledged receipt of the vehicle \u201cin good order and condition\u201d. Clause 4.2 stipulates that, in the event of the defendants issuing an Acceptance Receipt, that document would be conclusive evidence that the defendants have examined the vehicle and \u201cfound it to be complete and satisfactory and fit for such purpose for which it may be required.\u201d. Clause 4.2 goes on to make it clear that, the defendants agreed that the plaintiff is not liable for any defect or fault in the vehicle. Clause 5 further states that the defendants agrees that, the plaintiff does not lease the vehicle \u201c\u2026.. subject to any condition or warranty express, implied or statutory which are hereby expressly excluded and extinguished\u2026..\u201d and that, the plaintiff \u201cmakes no representation with regard to the quality or fitness\u201d of the vehicle. Next, by Clause 6 (a), the defendants have agreed that, the defendants are responsible for maintaining the vehicle in good repair and proper working condition and that the defendants are responsible for any \u201cdamage thereto howsoever occasioned (including fair wear and tear).\u201d. Clause 6 (a) also stipulates that, any loss or damage to the vehicle shall not impair the defendants\u2019 obligations and liabilities under the Lease Agreement and that the defendants\u2019 obligations and liabilities under the Lease Agreement \u201cshall continue in full force and effect\u201d notwithstanding any damage to the vehicle. Clause 8.1 states that, the defendants \u201c \u2026.. shall bear the entire risk of loss or damage to the equipment or any part thereof from whatsoever cause arising (including wear and tear)\u201d. Thus, by these contractual provisions, the defendants have not only acknowledged the fact that they chose the vehicle but have agreed that the plaintiff is not liable for any defect or shortcoming with regard to the quality of that vehicle or its fitness for use that may later become apparent. The defendants have agreed to bear the risk of any such defects or shortcomings with regard to the quality of the vehicle or its",

    "text": "fitness for use. The defendants have also agreed that, any defects in the vehicle will not affect their liability under the Lease Agreement. To sum up, the evidence referred to above does not suggest that the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d was frustrated. Further, the principle of law referred to above precludes the defendants from raising a defence of frustration of the Lease Agreement on the basis of alleged defects in the vehicle. Therefore, there is no need for this case to be sent back to the High Court for determination of an issue as to whether the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d was frustrated. Further, for purposes of record, I hold that, the learned trial judge erred when he answered the two additional issue no.s [12] and [13] in the affirmative. With regard to the other issues before the High Court, the learned trial judge has correctly answered, in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, the plaintiff\u2019s issues with regard to whether the 1st and 2nd defendants were bound by the Lease Agreement, whether the 1st and 2nd defendants had failed to pay the monthly rentals and whether the plaintiff has terminated the Lease Agreement. Next, with regard to the amount claimed by the plaintiff and set out in the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and the defendants\u2019 issues alleging that this amount was incorrect, the learned trial judge was of the view that the plaintiff had satisfactorily explained the amounts set out in the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and that there was no reason why the Court should not accept the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness in this regard. Accordingly, he answered the defendants\u2019 issue in the negative. However, since the judgment of the High Court states that, the amount claimed by the plaintiff was not closely examined because the High Court had held that the Lease Agreement was frustrated, it is necessary to examine whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum prayed for in the plaint. When the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d is scrutinised, it is seen that, although the plaintiff\u2019s witness stated in his evidence that the plaintiff repossessed the vehicle in 1999, the plaintiff has not given credit for the value of the vehicle in the Statement of Account. In the absence of any claim by the plaintiff to the contrary, it is fair to assume that, in the ordinary course of business, the plaintiff has sold the vehicle after it was repossessed. The plaintiff\u2019s reticence to reveal the sum received upon the sale, leads me to consider it reasonable to assume that the plaintiff would have received a sum of Rs.1,458,000/- which is the \u201cStipulated Loss Value\u201d of 90% of the \u201cCost of Equipment\u201d of Rs.1.620,000/- as mentioned in the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d read with the Item (9) of the Schedule to the Lease Agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d. Therefore, this sum of Rs.1,458,000/- has to be deducted from the sum of Rs.2,770,022/- which the Statement of Account marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d states is the sum due under the Lease Agreement as at 18th August 1998. The net sum due will then be Rs.1,312,022/-. In terms of the contract, the plaintiff is entitled to recover interest on this sum at 23.725% per annum from 18th August 1998 onwards. However, it is seen",

    "text": "that, as a result of the delay in the final determination of this case, the interest that will become due on Rs.1,312,022/- from 18th August 1998 onwards will be far in excess of the capital sum of Rs.1,312,022/-. Although the general rule is that, a plaintiff is entitled to recover interest from the date of decree till the date of payment, I am of the view that, in the circumstances of this particular case, it is fit and proper and equitable to limit the interest that may be recovered to a sum equivalent to the capital sum of Rs.1,312,022/-. Thus, the total sum which the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the 1st and 2nd defendants will be Rs. 2,624,044/-. Lastly, with regard to the defendants\u2019 issue suggesting that the Lease Agreement had not been duly stamped, the defendants led no evidence to substantiate that claim. The learned trial judge correctly answered that issue against the defendants. For the aforesaid reasons, the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. Judgment is entered for the plaintiff-appellant and against the 1st and 2nd defendants-respondents in a sum of Rs.2,624,044/- together with costs in the High Court. The High Court is directed to enter decree accordingly. In the circumstances of this case, each party will bear their own costs of appeal. Judge of the Supreme Court S.Eva Wanasundera, PC. J.
