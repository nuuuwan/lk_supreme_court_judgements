GOONERATNE J. Action was filed in the District Court of Galle by Plaintiff-Appellant-

Respondent against the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter called

the Defendant) praying for the following relief:

(a) A declaration that the land morefully described in paragraph 2 of the

plaint and the building standing thereon belongs to the Respondent.

(b) The ejectment of the Appellant from the said land and the building

standing thereon and for peaceful vacant possession thereof to be given

to the Respondent; and

(c) Damages in a sum of Rs.10,000,00 together with Rs.750,00 per mensum

from 01.10.1995 until restoration of the Respondent to vacant and

peaceful possession of the premises in suit.

Plaintiff inherited the premises in dispute. In or about 1946 father of the

Appellant was permitted to live in order to look after the plantation, on the basis

that he would handover vacant possession and building when requested to do

so. On the demise of Appellant’s father the Defendant continued to live and

occupy the land with his wife and children. It was, as stated by Plaintiff with the

leave and license of Plaintiff’s father. On 05.07.1995 Appellant built an extension

to the house already built. Plaintiff lodged a complaint with the Galle police.

Appellant failed to hand over possession. On or about 22.08.1995 Plaintiff sent

4

a quit notice, through his Attorney-at-Law. The Appellant ignored the notice and

continued to occupy.

The Plaintiff has good/sound title to the property in dispute. Land

in question is identified as lot 2 in plan 421A of Surveyor Gunasekera in D.C Galle

23536 in extent of 1 Rood 5.8 perches, a divided portion of a land called Mulane

Ketakalagahawatta”. Plaintiff traces his title to a partition decree in D.C. Galle

23536. Defendant was in occupation of a portion of land described above.

Defendant was a caretaker. Attention of this court has been drawn to the

following points by the learned President’s Counsel.

(a) Identity of corpus

(b) Plaintiff’s title

(c) Defendant’s wrongful occupation

(d) Damages caused to Plaintiff

This court takes the view that, Plaintiff having established above (a)

to (d), has satisfied court that the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of title and

ejectment of the Defendant and all those holding under the Defendant.

Defendant could be described as in permissive occupation, which

later turned out to be unlawful occupation. In fact in evidence Defendant has

admitted title of Plaintiff. Defendant has not placed material to show any

adverse possession which is a requirement under Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance.

I don’t see a basis to interfere with the High Court Judgment.

Corpus has been identified very clearly. Vide Jayasuriya Vs. Ubaid 61 NLR 352 at

353. Lathiff and Another Vs. Mansoor. 2001(BLR) 189 at 197. Plaintiff has

established paper title. Vide Loku Menike and another Vs. Gunasekera 1997 (2)

SLR 281; Leisa and another V. Simon 2002 (1) SLR 148 at 151 – 153. It was also

established the termination as an revocation of Defendant’s leave and licence.

Vide Ahriff Vs. Rasik 1985 (1) SLR 162 at 166.

In all the above circumstances, I affirm the Judgment of the High

Court and dismiss this appeal without costs.
