UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

At the hearing of the evidence for the case of the Plaintiff Respondent

before the Commercial High Court of Colombo, the 2nd Defendant Appellant made

an application to issue a commission to ascertain the market value of the property

of the mortgage bond bearing No 27 dated 04.04.1997. The said property had been

sold in auction and the mortgage bond had been released by the Plaintiff

Respondent. After hearing the objection raised by the Plaintiff Respondent the

learned High Court Judge of the Commercial High Court has refused the said

application. This appeal is from the said order dated 10.06.2011.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the grounds set out in paragraph

10 (b) and (e) of the petition of appeal dated 28.06.2011. In the said paragraphs,

4

the Appellant has averred that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

the vital importance and relevance of evidence obtain through a commission for

valuation of the mortgaged property in adjudication of the dispute between the

parties and has failed to evaluate the true purpose of a commission in arriving at a

conclusion.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent)

instituted an action in the Commercial High Court of Colombo against the 1st and

2nd Defendant seeking for a judgment inter alia to recover a sum of Rs

17,093,036.95 with interest as prayed for and auction the property described in the

Mortgage Bond bearing No 177 produced with the plaint marked ‘C’. The 2nd

Defendant Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has admitted the

signing of the mortgage bond bearing No 177 dated 18.06.1996. The 1st Defendant

Respondent has admitted the current account referred to in paragraph 3 of the

plaint.

The Appellant in his answer averred that subsequent to executing the

mortgage bond bearing No 177, the 1st Defendant Respondent on the request of the

Plaintiff Respondent had executed mortgage bond bearing No. 27 dated

04.04.1997. On the said premise the Appellant contended that the consequent to

entering in to the 2nd mortgage bearing No. 27, by novation of contract between the

Appellant and the Plaintiff Respondent, the rights of the Plaintiff Respondent Bank

has been restricted the said mortgage No 27. The Appellant’s contention is that

since the Plaintiff Respondent Bank has chosen the said mortgage bond No. 27 to

recover the dues of the Appellant, the Bank is not entitled to sell the mortgaged

property in the mortgage bond bearing No 177.

5

It was the position of the Plaintiff Respondent that the mortgage bond

bearing No 177 marked ‘C’ is in the nature of a continuing security up to a value of

Rs. 15 million. I carefully examined the said mortgage bond bearing no 177 dated

18.6.1996. The said mortgage bond 177 clearly states that Construction & Personal

Services (Pvt) Limited as the Obligor and Madhavan Lanka (Pvt) Limited as the

Mortgagor have entered in to the said mortgage bond with the Plaintiff Respondent

Bank. In terms of clause (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the said mortgage bond, the

Defendant Respondent have agreed to have the said mortgage bond as a continuing

security for the purposes stated in the said clauses.

Clause (a) of the said mortgage bond No 177 reads thus;

“All and every the sums and sum of money which shall or may at any

time and from time to time and at all times hereafter be or become the

owing and payable to the Bank by the Obligor/Mortgagor upon or in

respect of any and every overdraft or overdrafts of or on the said

current account now had by the Obligor/Mortgagor with the Bank at

its Colombo office or branches or which hereafter may be opened by

the Obligor/Mortgagor with the Bank whether at its Colombo office

aforesaid or at any of its other officers or branches and whether in the

name of the Obligor/Mortgagor or otherwise and the floating balance

from time to time due upon all or any such accounts current or current

account and the sum or sums of money which upon the closing of

such accounts current and current account shall be found to be due

owing and payable to the Bank”.

Said clause and also clauses (b), (c), (d), € and (f) clearly stipulates

that until the said bond No 177 is discharged, the bond is still valid. The mortgage

6

bond bearing No 27 does not contain any clause invalidating the effect of the said

clauses of mortgage bond No 177 or restricting its scope to any sum of money

which may due upon the Appellants’ current accounts subsequent to entering of

mortgage bond bearing No 27. The mere execution of the subsequent mortgage

bond No 27 can in no way extinguish the rights under the mortgage bond bearing

No 177.

It must be noted that the mortgage bond bearing No 27 marked ‘2 V 1

(G 1)’ too is in the nature of a continuing security up to a value of Rs. 5 million. I

examined the said mortgage bond bearing no 27 dated 04.04.1997. It is clearly

seen from the said mortgage bond that Construction & Personal Services (Pvt)

Limited as the Obligor and one Suppiah Alagaswamy Kandaswamy Naidu as the

Mortgagor have entered in to the said mortgage bond with the Plaintiff Respondent

Bank. In terms of clause (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the said mortgage bond, the

Defendant Respondent have agreed to have the said mortgage bond as a continuing

security for the purposes set out in the said clauses.

It is clear from the terms and conditions of the of the said two

mortgage bonds that both are two separate securities provided for by the 1st and 2nd

Defendant and one Suppiah Alagaswamy Kandaswamy Naidu in respect of the

overdraft facilities obtained and to be obtained by them in future from the Plaintiff

Respondent Bank. In fact, property in mortgage bond bearing No 27 had been sold

and the proceeds of sale have been credited to the relevant account in a sum of Rs

4,750,000/=. The 2nd Appellant was not a party to the said mortgage bond No 27.

Neither the sale of mortgaged property in mortgage bond No 27 nor the sale

proceeds or the value of the said property has been disputed by the parties to the

said mortgage bond.

7

On the other hand, according to Clause (b), at page 11 of the said

mortgage bond No 177, the Appellant has specifically agreed that the mortgage

bond No 177 will not be affected by any security that the Bank may at any time

and from time to time thereafter hold.

Hence the 2nd Appellant has no status to call in question the said

transaction or to seek permission of court to issue a commission to ascertain the

market value of the property in the said mortgage bond No 27.

In the circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 10.06.2011. Hence, I dismiss the appeal of the

appellant with costs. The learned High Court Judge is directed to proceed with the

trial.

Appeal dismissed.
