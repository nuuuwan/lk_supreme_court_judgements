UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The Petitioner has complained to this court that his fundamental right

to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka has been

infringed by the 1st Respondent, by refusing admission of his son, A. B. Abishek

Anuhas to Grade 01 of Kingswood College, Kandy.

The Petitioner, in his application dated 6th October, 2016, has averred

that he was baptised as a Cristian on 15th April 1979 and his wife Samanthika

Swarnamali was baptised on 16th October 1994. Their son, A. B. Abishek Anuhas

who was born on 17th April 2011, who was baptised on 12th June, 2011. Their

place of residence placed within the limits of administrative district of Kandy. He

had averred that his son A. B. Abishek Anuhas possesses the basic qualifications

necessary to gain admission to Kingswood College, Kandy in accordance with

Paragraphs 2.0 and 3.6 of the Instructions and Regulations regarding admission of

Children to Grade 01, 2017. On 23.06.2016, the Petitioner had submitted a school

admission application to the 1st Respondent, for admission of his son to Grade 01

in Kingswood College in 2017 under the quota allocated to Christian students.

3

After the interview, on 30.09.2016, a list of selection was posted on the school

notice board indicating that his son had not been selected for admission but had

been placed as No. 6 on a '‘waiting list’.

The Petitioner contended that his son was entitled to gain admission to

Grade 01, of Kingswood College in 2017 upon the document produced with the

petition marked P 11. The Petitioner has produced P 11 in order to consider his

application in terms of Regulation 3.2 of the Instructions related to the admission

of children to Grade 01 in the Government Schools for the year 2017. Said

Regulation 3.2 stipulates that “In filling vacancies in schools vested to government

under Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act No 05 of

1960 and Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary Provisions) Act

No 08 of 1961, the proportion of children belonging to different religions at the

time of vesting the school to the government will be taken into consideration and

the number of vacancies in the said school shall be accordingly divided among

different religions and categories. ….”

The 1st Respondent, in paragraph 10 of the statement of objection,

answering the paragraph 13 of the petition which has been set out on P 11, has

averred that there was no record or log entry available in the school which shows

the number of Christian students who were studying at the Kingswood College in

the year 1961. In the absence of confirmed statistics relating to the religious

composition of students enrolled at Kingswood College in the year 1961, the

school is unable to implement Clause 3.2 of the School Admission Circular marked

R 1.

Accordingly, the 1st Respondent has admitted that he was unable to

implement Clause 3.2 of the Instructions related to the admission of children to

4

Grade 01 in the Government Schools for the year 2017 due to the absence of

confirmed statistics relating to the religious composition. This is not a justifiable

answer. He has neither challenged nor denied the contents in P 11. In the

circumstances, I have no option but to consider the Petitioner’s application on the

strength of the material provided by the Petitioner. According to P 11, the

Petitioner should not have been denied admission to Grade 01 of Kingswood

College because he was well within the percentage set out in P 11. The

Respondents have failed to consider the said position in dealing with the

application of the Petitioner.

Therefore, I am of the view that by not considering the said clause 3.2

in accordance with the relevant percentage, the 1st Respondent has acted arbitrarily

and unreasonably and thereby infringed the Petitioner’s fundamental rights.

Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been violated by the 1st Respondent. I

therefore direct the 1st Respondent to admit the Petitioner’s son A. B. Abishek

Anuhas to Grade 01 of Kingswood College, Kandy. I make no order with regard to

costs.
