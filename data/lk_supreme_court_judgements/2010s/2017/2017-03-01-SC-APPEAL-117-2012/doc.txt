This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal wherein it

affirmed the judgment of the learned District Judge who held in favour of the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent. This court by its order dated 6.7.2012,

granted leave to appeal on questions of law stated in paragraphs 22(a), (b) and

(c) of the Petition of Appeal dated 4.1.2012 which are set out below.

a. Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law by failing to identify the District

Judges failure to evaluate evidence to attendant circumstances of the transaction with a view to establish a constructive trust? b. Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law by affirming the judgment of

District Court entered on the basis of that the non-notarial agreement V1 could be treated as a supplement to deed P1? c. Has the court of Appeal erred in Law by considering document V1 as a

supplement to P1 in order to create a conditional transfer between the parties, since V1 was contrary to Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance?

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows.

The Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant-Appellant) by deed No.6261 dated 26.2.1990 attested by SP

Gunawardene Notary Public transferred the property in suit to the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

3

Respondent) in a sum of Rs.110,000/- The deed No.6261 was marked as P1 at

the trial. On the same day that the deed No.6261 was executed (26.2.1990), the

Plaintiff-Respondent, by a letter dated 26.2.1990 marked P1, agreed to retransfer

the property that he purchased by deed No.6261to the Defendant-Appellant if a

sum of Rs.110,000/- is paid by Defendant-Appellant to the Plaintiff-Respondent

within a period of one year from 26.2.1990. Thus it is clear that if the

Defendant-Appellant wants to get the property back, he will have to pay

Rs.110,000/- to the Plaintiff-Respondent within one year from 26.2.1990.

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant contended that the

Defendant-Appellant had borrowed a sum of Rs.80,000/- from the Plaintiff-

Respondent and the deed No.6261 was executed only to provide security for the

said amount and the interest. The interest for Rs.80,000/- was calculated to be

Rs.30,000/-. He therefore contended that the Defendant-Appellant, by deed No

6261, had not transferred the property to the Plaintiff-Respondent. I now advert

to this contention. It is in evidence that the Defendant-Appellant, after the

execution of deed No.6261, made an application to the Debt Conciliation Board

to get relief regarding this transaction but the Debt Conciliation Board rejected

the said application. In deed No. 6261 there is nothing to suggest that it was

executed to provide security for a sum of Rs.80,000/- that the Defendant-

Appellant had borrowed from the Plaintiff-Respondent. Even in the document

marked V1 there is no such indication. There is also no clear evidence by the

Defendant-Appellant on this matter. When I consider all the above matters, I am

unable to agree with the above contention of learned counsel for the Defendant-

Appellant. Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant next tried to contend

that the learned District Judge should not have considered document marked V1

as it is contrary to Section 2 of the Prevention of Fraud Ordinance. It has to be

4

noted here that the document marked V1 was produced by the Defendant-

Appellant himself at the trial and that the Defendant-Appellant also, on the

strength V1, relied on a constructive trust between him and the Plaintiff-

Respondent. One of the important questions that must be considered here is that

whether the court cannot consider the document marked V1 when the

Defendant-Appellant relies on a constructive trust between him and the Plaintiff-

Respondent. It is undisputed that the document marked V1 is not a document

executed by a Notary Public and it relates to the property in suit. In considering

the above contention of learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant, I must

consider the following question. In order to prove a constructive trust, is parole

evidence permitted in view of the principles set out in Section 2 of the

Prevention of Fraud Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance? This

question was discussed in the case of Dayawathi and Others Vs Gunasekara and

Another [1991] 1 SLR 115. Before I discuss the said judicial decision, I would

like to consider Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance which reads as follows.

"Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot

reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that

he intended to dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or

legatee must hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative."

The facts set out in the head note of Dayawathi and Others Vs Gunasekara and

Another (supra) is as follows.

“The Plaintiff bought the property in suit in 1955. He started construction

work in 1959 and completed in 1961. The Plaintiff, a building contractor,

needed finances in 1966 and sought the assistance of the 2nd defendant

5

with whom he had transactions earlier. This culminated in a Deed of

Transfer in favour of the 1st Defendant, who is the mother of the 2nd

Defendant and the 2nd Defendant being a witness to the Deed. The

property was to be re-transferred within 3 years if Rs. 17,000/- was paid.

The Plaintiff defaulted, in his action to recover the property, the Plaintiff

succeeded in the trial Court in establishing a constructive trust. The

Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on the sole ground that the

agreement was a pure and simple agreement to re-transfer.”

His lordship Justice Dheeraratne in the above case held as follows:

“(i) The Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance do not bar parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and

that the transferor did not intend to pass the beneficial interest in the

property.

(ii) Extrinsic evidence to prove attendant circumstances can properly be

received in evidence to prove a resulting trust.”

In order to establish legal principles discussed in Section 83 of the

Trust Ordinance, in my view, it is necessary to lead parole evidence between the

parties. If this evidence is shut out, the purpose of Section 83 of the Trust

Ordinance would be rendered nugatory. Applying the principles laid down in the

above legal literature, I hold that Section 2 of the Prevention of Fraud Ordinance

and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance do not operate as a bar to lead parole

evidence to prove a constructive trust between the parties. Considering all the

above matters, I hold that the learned District Judge was correct when he

6

considered the document marked V1 and that the court should consider the

document marked V1. I therefore reject the above contention of learned counsel

for the Defendant-Appellant.

The next question that must be considered is whether the Plaintiff-

Respondent held the property in suit on behalf of the Defendant-Appellant on a

constructive trust. In considering this question the document marked V1 is

relevant. I have earlier discussed the contents of the document marked V1. It is

important to note that the Defendant-Appellant did not, after the execution of

deed No.6261, hand over the possession of the property in suit to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. I have earlier held that the learned District Judge was correct when

he considered the document marked V1. When I consider the contents of the

document marked V1 and the fact that the Defendant-Appellant did not, after the

execution of deed No.6261, hand over the possession of the property in suit to

the Plaintiff-Respondent, I hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent held the property

in suit on behalf of the Defendant-Appellant on a constructive trust for a period

of one year from 26.2.1990 to 26.2.1991. The Plaintiff-Respondent, by the

document marked V1, has agreed to retransfer the property in suit to the

Defendant-Appellant if a sum of Rs.110,000/- is paid to the Plaintiff-Respondent

by the Defendant-Appellant within a period of one year from 26.2.1990. But the

Defendant-Appellant has failed to pay the said sum of money within the said

period. When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the

aforementioned constructive trust has come to an end on 26.21991 and was not

in operation when the case was filed on 28.5.1992.

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant relied on the judicial

decision in the case of Premawathi Vs Gnanawathi [1994] 2SLR 171. In

Premawathi’s case (supra) the plaintiff, in her evidence, admitted the following

7

facts. (i) that she was in hospital for about 2 months from August 1976; (ii) that

while in hospital the defendant came to see her and discussed with her the

question of the retransfer of the property; (iii) that the hospital authorities did

not permit the notary to come to the hospital and the deed of retransfer could not

be executed; (iv) that she was willing to retransfer the property within the

stipulated period of 6 months; (v) in answer to court, that the value of the

property was about Rs. 15000/- in 1976. His Lordship GPS de Silva CJ held as

follows.

“An undertaking to reconvey the property sold was by way of a

non-notarial document which is of no force or avail in law under section

2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. However the attendant

circumstances must be looked into as the plaintiff had been willing to

transfer the property on receipt of Rs. 6000/- within six months but could

not do so despite the tender of Rs. 6000/- within the six months as she was

in hospital, and the possession of the land had remained with the 1st

defendant and the land itself was worth Rs. 15,000/-, the attendant

circumstances point to a constructive trust within the meaning of section

83 of the Trusts Ordinance. The "attendant circumstances" show that the

1st defendant did not intend to dispose of the beneficial interest.”

The facts of the said case are different from the facts of the present case. I

therefore hold that the decision in Premawathi’s case (supra) has no application

to the present case.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the above questions of law in the

negative and hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to the relief calmed in

8

the Plaint. I affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge and the Court of

Appeal and dismiss this appeal with costs.
