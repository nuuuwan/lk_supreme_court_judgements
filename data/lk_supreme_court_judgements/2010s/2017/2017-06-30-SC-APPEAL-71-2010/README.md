Sisira J De Abrew J

This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court dated

04.11.2009 wherein he acquitted the accused-appellant-respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the accused-respondents).

10

The accused-respondents were convicted by the learned Magistrate

on Charge No.1 (a charge of trespass punishable under Section 433 read with

Section 146 of the Penal Code), on Charge No.2 (a charge of mischief

punishable under Section 409 read with Section146 and 408 of the Penal Code)

and on Charge No.3 (a charge of being members of an unlawful assembly

punishable under Section 140 read with Section 138 of the Penal Code). They

were, on Charge No.1, ordered to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-. On Charge No.2 they

were ordered to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-. On Charge No.3 they were sentenced

to 6 months rigorous imprisonment suspended for 10 years.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Magistrate the

accused-respondents appealed to the High Court. High Court, by its judgment

dated 04.11.2009, set aside the conviction and the sentence. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment of the High Court, the aggrieved party has appealed to

this Court. This Court by its order dated 21.07.2010, granted leave to appeal

on questions of law set out in paragraph 30(a) to 30(f) of the petition of appeal

dated 14.02.2009 which are stated below-

a. Where the charge sheet in a Magistrate‟s Court contains a charge of

unlawful assembly or being a member of an unlawful assembly (in terms

of s.138 read with 140 etc) does it become a legal requirement for the

prosecution to file a non-settlement certificate under the Mediation

Boards Act No 72 of 1988 (as amended) in order to maintain their action?

b. In the course of a trial before the Magistrate‟s Court, if a charge against

the accused is amended by the Magistrate on his own accord, is it

11

imperative that a fresh charge sheet with a fresh plaint should be

annexed to the record?

c. In the course of a trial before the Magistrate‟s Court, if a charge against

the accused is amended by the Magistrate on his own accord, is it

imperative that the Magistrate shall order a fresh trial?

d. Did the charge sheet in the instant matter contain a charge where it was

averred that an offense punishable under s.138 read with 140 of the

Penal Code has been committed?

e. At all events, is it possible in law to convict an accused, even in a

situation where the charge sheet mentions only the section which spells

out the definition (without mentioning the punitive section)?

f. When there is a change of Magistrate midway in the course of a trial, in

terms of the proviso to s.267 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is there a

burden on the trial judge to offer the option of a fresh trial to the accused

person or is it a right which the accused or his counsel could exercise by

demanding a fresh trial?

This Court also allowed the following question of law raised by learned

President‟s Counsel appearing for the accused-respondents.

„„Is the aggrieved party virtual complainant–petitioner entitled in law to

seek appeal against the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge

made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction?‟‟

I would first like to consider the question of law raised by the learned

President‟s Counsel for the accused-respondents. In considering the said

12

question of law it is relevant to consider Section 9 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of 1990 which reads as follows:-

9 “Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person

aggrieved by-

(a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the

appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article

154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act or any other law, in

any matter or proceeding whether civil or criminal which involves a

substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme

Court if the High Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court

ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved party to such

matter or proceedings:

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant

special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or

interlocutory order, judgment, decree or sentence made by such High

Court, in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by

paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of

this Act, or any other law where such High Court has refused to

grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, or where in the opinion

of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for review by the

Supreme Court:

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to

appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the

question to be decided is of public or general importance; and

13

(b) a final order, judgment or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction

conferred on it by paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P of the

Constitution may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal.”

Article 154P (3) (b) reads as follows:-

(3) “Every such High Court shall –

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any

law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts any Primary Courts within the Province;”

The impugned order of the High Court in the present case was made in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, it is an order made after

invoking the jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution. When

this Court granted leave to appeal, this Court had decided that this case was fit

for review by the Supreme Court. When I consider the above legal literature I

hold that an aggrieved party complainant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as

aggrieved party petitioner) is entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court against

the impugned order. I answer the above question of law in the following

language.

„„The aggrieved party virtual complainant-petitioner is entitled in law to

appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Provincial High

Court made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction‟‟

14

The charge sheet in this case was amended. The learned High

Court Judge concluded that the amended charges were not read out to the

accused by the learned Magistrate. Section 167 (1) and (2) of the Criminal

Procedure Code reads as follows:-

167 (1) Any court may alter any indictment or charge at any time

before judgment is pronounced or, in the case of trials before

the High Court by a jury, before the verdict of the jury is

returned.

(2) Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the

accused.

It is a requirement under the law when the charge sheet or indictment is

amended, amended charge sheet or the indictment should be read and

explained to the accused. Although the learned High Court Judge concluded

that the amended charge sheet had not been read out to the accused-

respondents, page 125 of the appeal brief reveals that the learned Magistrate

had read out the amended charge sheet to the accused-respondents and they

had pleaded not guilty to the charges. Therefore the learned High Court Judge,

in my view, was in error when he reached the above conclusion.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment concluded that the

learned Magistrate under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot

change a portion of the charge. Under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure

Code amendment of a charge or an indictment is permitted. Can an

amendment of a charge be effected without changing a portion of a charge?

15

This question has been answered in the negative. The High Court Judge has

fallen into error when he reached the above conclusion. What was the

amendment effected in this case? The learned Magistrate deleted Section 32 of

the Penal Code and inserted Section 146 of the Penal Code. Thus, this

amendment cannot cause prejudice to the accused-respondents. In Doole v.

Republic of Sri Lanka (78-79) 2 SLR page 33 the Court of Appeal held –

„„As a rule an amendment or an indictment should be allowed if it

would have the effect of convicting the guilty or securing the

acquittal of the innocent but it should not be allowed if it would

cause substantial injustice or prejudice to the accused.‟‟

In my view the learned High Court Judge would not have fallen into the above

error if he considered the principles enunciated in the above judicial decision.

The learned High Court Judge concluded that failure to order a new trial under

Section 169 of the Criminal Procedure Code by the learned Magistrate when

the charge sheet was amended had caused prejudice to the accused-

respondents. Section 169 of the Criminal Procedure Code reads as follows:-

169. “If the alteration made under section 167 is such that proceeding

immediately with the trial is likely in the opinion of the court to prejudice

the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the court may either direct a

new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.”

16

As I pointed out earlier amendment to the charge sheet had not

caused prejudice to the accused-respondents. When amended charge sheet

was read out to the accused, the lawyer appearing for the accused-respondents

had not even asked for a new trial or an adjournment of the trial. Thus, what

is the basis on which the learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion

that the failure on the part of the Magistrate to order a fresh trial had caused

prejudice to the accused-respondents? There is no basis. When I consider the

above matters, I hold that the learned High Court Judge had fallen into grave

error when he reached the above conclusion.

The learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion that the

identity of the accused-respondents has not been proved by the prosecution.

But Rathnayake Koralage Danny in his evidence had identified all the accused

in Court. His evidence with regard to the identity of the accused was

corroborated by Lunuhewage Sirisena. When I consider the above evidence I

hold the view that the learned High Court Judge had fallen into grave error

when he reached the above conclusion. The learned High Court Judge

concluded that as the accused-respondents have been charged under Section

433 and 409 of the Penal Code the case should have been referred to the

Mediation Board and a non-settlement certificate under Section 14 (A) and/ or

12 should have been produced before the Magistrate and that the Magistrate

did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the case without the said non-

17

settlement certificate being filed in Court. I now advert to this contention. The

second schedule of the Mediation Board Act No.72 of 1988 does not include

offence under Section 140 of the Penal Code. The 3rd Charge leveled against

the accused-respondents is a charge under Section 140 of the Penal Code.

When one charge of a charge sheet comes within the schedule of the Mediation

Board Act and the other charge does not come within the schedule of the

Mediation Board Act, should such a case be referred to the Mediation Board?

If this question is to be answered in the affirmative when an accused person is

charged for robbery of a bank and for causing mischief (a charge under Section

409 of the Penal Code) the case should then be referred to the Mediation Board

and a non-settlement certificate should be filed. Robbery of a bank cannot be

settled by Mediation Board. If the accused is convicted for robbery of a bank

the Magistrate or the High Court Judge as the case may be will have to impose

a punishment. In a case of this nature, if Mediation Board Act procedure is

adopted it will be a waste of time and would contribute to the laws delays in

the country. In my view this is not what the legislature intended and the

Mediation Board Act was enacted. Therefore the above question cannot be

answered in the affirmative. Considering the above matters, I hold that when

one charge of a charge sheet comes within the schedule of the Mediation Board

Act and the other charge does not come within the said schedule, such a case

need not be referred to the Mediation Board and a non-settlement certificate

from the Mediation Board is not necessary. For the above reasons I hold that

the learned High Court Judge had fallen into grave error when he reached the

18

above conclusion. For the aforementioned reasons I answer the questions of

law raised in paragraphs 30(a) to 30(c) in the negative. The questions of law set

out in paragraphs 30(d) to 30 (f) do not arise for consideration.

For the aforementioned reasons I hold that the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge cannot be permitted to stand. I therefore set aside

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 04.11.2009 and affirm the

judgment of the learned Magistrate dated 17.01.2005.

Judgment of the High Court Judge set aside.

Judgment of the Magistrate affirmed.
