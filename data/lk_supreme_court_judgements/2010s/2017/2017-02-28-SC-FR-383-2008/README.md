GOONERATNE J. The Petition dated 23.09.2008 states the Petitioners served as

Wharf Field Officers of the Department of Food and are now retired. Thereafter

caption had to be amended and the Petitioners have filed amended petition. It

is averred that this application relates to the wilful failure of the Public Service

Commission (1st to 9th Respondents) to implement the order of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is pleaded that the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal has been established by Article 59(2) of the Constitution which is final

in terms of Section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002.

This case has a history and the facts need to be ascertained carefully firstly from

the petitioners.

It is stated that the Petitioners joined the Department of Food as

Casual Wharf Clerks and thereafter appointed as Wharf Clark. Letter of

appointment is dated 08.02.1967 (P2). In 1975 Wharf Service of the department

was re-structured and three classes were created. Scheme of recruitment is

produced marked P3. In the manner pleaded in paragraph 7 of the petition, the

Petitioners were absorbed to Class II (b) of the service and thereafter promoted

to Class II (a). They also state that their promotions were back dated to

01.04.1975. Letter P4, P5 & P6 annexed to the petition seems to support this

8

position but some of these documents are not legible and back dating cannot be

clearly ascertained. The next promotion was to the post of Field Officer–Class I

(paragraph 5:5 & 5:6 of P3). The Wharf Field Officers in Class II (a) and who have

passed the Efficiency Bar Examination and are placed in the Rs. 5880/= salary

scale, are eligible to be promoted to Class I upon facing an interview. The

Efficiency Bar Examination was scheduled to be held on 19.11.1977 but

postponed on several occasions (P7A to P7D) for various reasons.

Petitioners allege that postponement of the Efficiency Bar

Examination was done to enable 12 Wharf Field Officers who reached the age

of 45 and who had not passed the Efficiency Bar Examination, to be promoted.

By letter P8, Food Commissioner sought the approval of Director Establishments

and the Director by letter P9 approved the promotions of 12 Wharf Field Officers

on the conditions that such promotions should not be a precedent. However the

Efficiency Bar Examination was ultimately held on or about 1982, but Petitioners

were not promoted to Class I though there were vacancies. Several requests

were made to the relevant authorities to promote the Petitioner to Class 1.

A letter that seems to help the Petitioners is produced marked P11. By P11 Food

Commissioner informs the Petitioners that in respect of Wharf Field Officers

Class II (a) who applied for Efficiency Bar, in 1977 and who sat the examination

in 1982, the year of passing the examination will be considered as 1977. By letter

9

P12 of 12.03.1994 the 3rd Petitioner was promoted. In the same way 1st to 10th,

12th, 16th, 18th, 21st and 22nd Petitioners were promoted to Class I with effect

from 15.01.1992. The rest of the Petitioners to this application were not

promoted as they had retired by that time.

The Petitioners in view of letter P11 issued by the Food

Commissioner, had requested the authorities concerned that their promotions

to Class I be back dated to 1978 on a Supernumerary basis (vide P13A to P13 D).

Petitioners get more support for their plea to back date the appointment, also

from the Food Commissioner by letter P13 E of ‘05.11.1993. P11 & P13 E fortify

the position of Petitioners’.

Petitioners aver that they made further requests to the authorities

concerned as stated above that their promotions to Class I be back dated to 1978

on a supernumerary basis and state that the Director, Establishment by his letter

of 29.08.1994 informed the Secretary to the Department of Food that such an

approval cannot be granted to the Petitioners in the manner requested by them,

as stated above (P13F). The Public Service Commission by its letter of

08.07.2002, (P13G) informs the Secretary, Ministry of Co-operatives that the

requests as above by the Petitioners were considered and directed that those

officers who passed the Efficiency Bar Examination in 1982, can be promoted to

Class I on the basis they passed the Efficiency Bar Examination in 1977, if they

10

have 10 years’ service and other necessary qualifications. Thereafter the

Petitioners informed the relevant authorities that they have fulfilled all the

requirements as per the scheme of recruitment and to back date their

promotions to 1978. However the PSC by their decisions P14 & P15 refused to

do so as the Petitioners have not fulfilled the necessary qualifications as per the

scheme of recruitment.

Details of the employment of the Petitioners are produced marked

P15A. It is also disclosed by the Petitioner in paragraph 22 of the petition that

the 2nd Petitioner filed a Fundamental Rights Application bearing No. SC

299/2005 alleging that the PSC has violated the Fundamental Rights of the 2nd

Petitioner by their aforesaid decisions. But the Supreme Court refused to grant

leave to proceed. Thereafter 33 Wharf Field Officers including the Petitioners

appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision of the PSC

on 22.08.2005 (P16). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal having heard the

appeal held in favour of the Petitioners, and the tribunal made order rescinding

the above decision of the PSC and made order that all 33 Appellants in Class I of

the Wharf Field Service be promoted by antedating their appointment to

01.05.1978 and that they would be entitled to all consequential benefits (P17).

In spite of the order P17 by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Public

Service Commission failed to give effect to the above order dated 19.07.2006

11

(P17) to date. Though numerous requests were made to the PSC, the PSC failed

and rejected to take action as required by order P17 of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal.

It is also pleaded that the Petitioners informed the PSC to

implement the order P17 and also at a meeting by some of the Petitioners with

officers of the PSC, the Petitioners were informed that the matter has been

referred to the Hon. Attorney General to whom the Petitioners made several

requests. Hon. Attorney General by P20A, P20B & P20C referred the matter to

the PSC for consideration and necessary action.

It is not incorrect to state that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

(AAT) is the Appellate Body and the PSC will be bound to abide by a decision of

the AAT. The AAT which is established under Article 59(1) of the Constitution

and in terms of Article 59(2), the AAT has the power to alter, vary or rescind any

order or decision made by the commission. Article 59(3) states the Constitution,

powers and procedure of the AAT is to be provided for by law and the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002 was enacted for that purpose.

Section 3(a) of the said Act, AAT has the power to hear and determine any

appeal preferred to it from any order or decision made by the PSC in the exercise

of powers under Chapter IX of the Constitution. Further Section 8(2) provides

12

that a decision made by the tribunal (AAT) shall be final and conclusive and shall

not be called in question in any suit or proceedings in a court of law.

The preclusive clause has been included in the said Act with regard

to challenging the decision of the AAT and the legislature has done so to ensure

that a decision of the AAT must have finality. As such PSC will be bound to abide

by a decision of the AAT.

I have also perused the affidavit of the then Chairman (1st

Respondent) of the PSC. It is pleaded that Wharf Field Officers in Class II (a), who

have passed their Efficiency Bar Examination and placed in the Rs.5880/- salary

scale are eligible to be promoted to Class I, upon facing an interview. On a

perusal of the affidavit of the 1st Respondent I find that very many factual

positions taken up by the Petitioner are admitted by the Respondents. It is

admitted that the Petitioners on several occasions requested that their

promotion to Class I be antedated to 01.05.1978, and such requests were made

on the basis that on previous occasions, certain officers had been promoted to

Class I though they did not satisfy the eligibility criteria for promotions. Such

promotions were made on the basis that there should not be a precedent.

It is further pleaded by the 1st Respondent that requests made by

the Petitioners have been turned down by the Director, Establishments by

letters of 31.03.1992 & 29.08.1994 (P13F). Repeated requests of these officers

13

were submitted to the relevant Minister who submitted a Cabinet

Memorandum and called for a report from Salaries and Cadre Committee. The

resulting position was that the Cabinet as well as the Salaries and Cadre

Committees pointed out that these officers are not entitled to be promoted and

thus the Cabinet of Ministers had not approved such manner of promotions. In

this regard letter 1R4, 1R5, 1R6 & 1R8 are produced. What is emphasised is that

the eligibility criteria for promotions and that the promotions can only be

granted if there were substantive vacancies at the relevant time. Petitioners

sought appointments on a supernumerary basis very well knowing that there

were no vacancies as at that date, and knowing that previously it was due to

certain officers which were not to be relied upon as a precedent. All 17 officers

promoted in 1978 were senior to the Petitioners. Thereafter there was only one

(1) promotion to Class I in 1983 and four (4) promotions in 1986. As such there

were no vacancies to promote the Petitioners though they passed the Efficiency

Bar Examination in 1982.

The Director General of Establishment by letter of 31.03.1999 (1R7)

stated that promotions to Class I, should be on seniority in service and

availability of vacancies. 1st Respondent specifically aver that the Administrative

14

Appeals Tribunal had not considered the above matters in arriving at its finding.

Finally the 1st Respondent, plead that it is not possible to implement the said

decision of the AAT, taking into consideration the serious repercussions that

would have followed if such decision of AAT was implemented.

This seems to be a long standing issue. The law on the point of

constitutional provisions need not be disturbed by this court. There is finality

attached to the AAT order P17. The Public Service Commission should have

canvassed this order and placed the matters pleaded by the 1st Respondent in

this application before a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. It was not done. It is

stated that this court refused to grant Leave to Appeal to the 2nd Petitioner on

the same issue. That was prior to the AAT order. Perhaps if the PSC took the step

to canvass the AAT order the position may have been different. i.e this court

should not disturb the regular procedure pertaining to appointments,

promotions, transfer, dismissal etc. of the Public Service. In fundamental Rights

Applications this court has wide powers to make just and equitable orders.

Petitioners have with them a valid unchallenged order (P17). Thereby acquired

15

a right to enjoy the fruits of the order. As such I hold that the Petitioners are

entitled to relief as per sub paragraphs (b) and (c ) of the prayer to the last

Amended Petition.

Application allowed, without costs.
