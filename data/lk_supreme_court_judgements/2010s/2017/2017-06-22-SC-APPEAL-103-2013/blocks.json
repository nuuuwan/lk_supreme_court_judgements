Further, the Court of Appeal transferred the case to the District Court of Ratnapura and directed that the trial be heard de novo with the parties having the right to amend their pleadings if they so desired. The Court of Appeal did not make an Order setting aside the judgment dated 08th December 1998 entered by the District Court. However, the fact that, the Court of Appeal ordered that the trial be heard de novo would result in that judgment of the District Court being deemed to have been set aside by the Court of Appeal.",

As mentioned earlier, Somawathie Hamine was Madduma Appuhami\u2019s daughter; Somawathie Hamine became solely entitled to the premises after the death of Wijewardena Appuhami; In the meantime, Madduma Appuhami had given the premises on lease to the defendant\u2019s husband upon a lease agreement no. 222 dated 08 November 1967.At the end of term of that lease agreement, the defendant\u2019s husband continued to remain in the premises as a monthly tenant; After the death of the defendant\u2019s husband, the defendant had attorned as tenant to Somawathie Hamine and paid monthly rent to Somawathie Hamine; the premises were later transferred by Somawathie Hamine to the plaintiff, by deed of transfer no. 1562 dated 03rd December 1990 and, thereby, the plaintiff obtained sole title to the premises. It should be mentioned that, the plaintiff was Somawathie Hamine\u2019s son-in-law; By a letter dated 31st January 1991, the plaintiff had requested the defendant to attorn as tenant to the plaintiff and pay the monthly rent to the plaintiff; However, the defendant had not done so; Further, the defendant had failed to quit the premises though requested to do so; The defendant\u2019s failure to quit the premises had caused loss and damage to the plaintiff in a sum of Rs.9,000/- with further loss and damage at the rate of Rs.500/- per month until the plaintiff obtained possession of the premises; On the aforesaid basis, the plaintiff prayed for a declaration that he is entitled to the premises described in the schedule to the plaint, for the ejection of the defendant from the premises and for the recovery of damages.",

The first and fourth questions of law set out above raise the question as to whether the plaintiff cannot have and maintain this action because the corpus which is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s action had not been adequately identified. The second, third and fifth questions of law raise the issue whether the plaintiff cannot have and maintain this action since the plaintiff and the substituted defendants-appellants are co-owners of a larger land and the co-ownership has not been terminated. With regard to the first and fourth questions of law, when the plaintiff gave evidence, he clearly identified the land and premises described in the schedule to the plaint and described its metes and bounds in the manner set out in the schedule to the plaint. The plaintiff stated that, the land and premises described in the schedule to the plaint was a shop room which is 18 feet in length along the Southern boundary, which was the Nedola Road. The plaintiff went on to state that, the Western boundary was the wall of Hendrick Appuhami\u2019s house [Hendrick Appuhami was the defendant\u2019s husband] which is now the shop room occupied by the defendant, which is 40 feet in length and 24 feet in width and that the Southern boundary of the defendant\u2019s premises was also the Nedola Road. The plaintiff pointed out that the Eastern boundary of the land and premises described in the schedule to the plaint, was the Embilipitya-Suriyakanda Road. It is apparent from the schedule to the amended plaint that, this Eastern boundary is 12 feet in width. The plaintiff emphasised that the substituted defendants-appellants had not claimed any land or premises which bordered the Embilipitya-Suriyakanda Road. The plaintiff stated that, the Northern boundary was the wall of the shop now occupied by Wijaya Mudalali - vide: the evidence at p.352-354 and p.400-401 of the record. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence clearly identified the land and premises described in the schedule to the amended plaint, stated its precise dimensions and extent and clearly stated its boundaries. The plaintiff was cross examined over three days by counsel for the defendant who repeatedly questioned the plaintiff on the identification and description of the land described in the schedule to the plaint. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence remained clear, consistent and unshaken. When the defendant\u2019s Attorney, Manamperi gave evidence, he admitted in cross examination that the corpus claimed by the plaintiff was correctly described in the schedule to the amended plaint \u2013 [vide: the evidence at p.421-423 and at p.435 of the record].

A: \u0d94\u0dc0\u0dca. The identity of the corpus is further established by the fact that, the land which is the subject matter of this action bounded on the East by the Embilipitya-Suriyakanda Road and on the South by the Nedola Road, which are both public roads. Next, the Western boundary is the premises which are admittedly owned by the substituted defendants-appellants and there is no dispute about the fact that, the Northern boundary of the land is the land previously owned by John Singho and now owned by Wijaya Mudalali. Thus, the evidence placed before the District Court including the admission by the defendant\u2019s Attorney who gave evidence on behalf of the 1A substituted defendant-appellant-petitioner/appellant, clearly identified the land which is the subject matter of this action. In appeal, the learned High Court Judges carefully examined the evidence relating to the identity of the corpus and held that the learned District Judge had correctly determined that, the identity of the corpus had been proved. In the light of the evidence of the plaintiff, the admission made by the defendant\u2019s Attorney and the aforesaid boundaries of the corpus, I see no reasons to disagree with the determination of the High Court. Accordingly, the first and fourth questions of law, are answered in the negative. The second, third and fifth questions of law raise the issue of whether the plaintiff cannot have and maintain this action since the plaintiff and the substituted defendants-appellants are co-owners of a larger land and the co-ownership has not been terminated. Interestingly, the substituted defendants-appellants did not make out a case on these lines in the District Court. No issues were raised at the trial with regard to whether the plaintiff and the substituted defendants-appellants are co-owners of a larger land and the co-ownership has not been terminated. In any event, a perusal of the deeds relied on by the parties and the evidence makes it abundantly clear that there is no merit or substance in the appellant\u2019s contentions which have been embodied in the second, third and fifth questions of law. In this connection, it is common ground that the land and premises which are claimed by both parties were part of the larger land named \u201cBogahaliyadde\u201d which was owned by V.Sinnadorai and S. Ponnamma. It is evident from the deed no. 14443 dated 03rd December 1916 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/ \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d and its schedule, that V.Sinnadorai and S. Ponnamma sold and transferred, to P.A.John Singho and D.Hinnihami, a 5/48th of that larger land on which was situated (i) a thatched two roomed shop premises and (ii)",

P.A.John Singho and D.Hinnihami were husband and wife and D.Hinnihami was the mother of Madduma Appuhami from whom the plaintiff claims title. Thereafter, P.A.John Singho and D.Hinnihami sold and transferred only the aforesaid thatched two roomed shop premises [described in (i) above] to H.J.Martin Appuhamy by deed no.1519 dated 15th June 1917 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d, as set out in schedule of this deed which shows that the land and premises sold to H.J.Martin Appuhamy was 26 feet in length and 24 feet in width and that the Eastern boundary of that land and premises was the shop room with a tiled roof and that the Southern boundary was the Nedola Road. Thus, it is clear that the shop room with a tiled roof situated on the Eastern boundary of the thatched two roomed shop premises sold and transferred to H.J.Martin Appuhamy and referred to in the schedule to deed no.1519 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d, is the shop room bearing no.51 which is described in (ii) of the aforesaid schedule to deed no. 14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. Thereafter, by the deed of transfer no .7404 dated 19th November 1940, marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d, H.J.Martin Appuhamy sold and transferred, to the defendant\u2019s husband, the land and premises he had obtained under the aforesaid deed no. 1519 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd2 3\u201d \u2013 ie: the shop premises which are 26 feet in length and 24 feet in width and with an Eastern boundary which is the shop room bearing no.51 with a tiled roof which is described in (ii) of the aforesaid schedule to deed no. 14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/ \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d referred to earlier. The 1A substituted defendant-appellant-petitioner/appellant claims title under and in terms of this deed no. 7404 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d and when he gave evidence, he expressly said so. Manamperi also stated the same fact. P.A.John Singho and D.Hinnihami continued to jointly own the shop room bearing no.51 with a tiled roof which is 18 feet in length and 12 feet in width and the adjacent shop room with a tiled roof which is 18 feet in length and 14 feet in width, which are described in (ii) and (iii) of the schedule to deed no. 14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. The plaintiff testified that, subsequently, P.A.John Singho and D.Hinnihami divided these two shop rooms between them with P.A.John Singho having sole ownership of the shop room with a tiled roof which is 18 feet in length and 14 feet in width \u2013 ie: (iii) of the schedule to deed no.14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d - and D.Hinnihami having sole ownership of the shop room bearing no.51 with a tiled roof which is 18 feet in length and 12 feet in width - ie: (ii) of the schedule to deed no.14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d.

Later, Madduma Appuhami transferred that shop room to his daughter, Somawathie Hamine and Wijewardena Appuhami by the deed of transfer no. 8520 dated 09th June 1943 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d.

    "text": "death of Wijewardena Appuhami. Later she has transferred that shop room to the plaintiff by deed no.1562 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d. As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff has given clear evidence that the land which is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s action is the shop room bearing no.51 which is 18 feet in length and 12 feet in width and has a tiled roof, which is described in (ii) of the schedule to deed no.14443 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d/\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d, and which was transferred to the plaintiff by the deed no.1562 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d. He also stated that, the boundaries of that shop room are those described the schedule to the amended plaint, which were described above. It is clear from the evidence that, the land and premises which are the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s action and are described in the schedule to the amended plaint, have been held and owned as a distinct and divided allotment of land for several decades prior to the institution of this action. The fact that, the defendant\u2019s husband and predecessor in title recognized and accepted this fact is proved by the lease agreement no.222 dated 08th November 1967 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d by which Madduma Appuhami has leased the land and premises which are the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s action to the defendant\u2019s husband for a period of 30 months at a monthly rent of Rs.381/08.The description of the land and premises in the schedule to that lease agreement is the same as the description of the land and premises set out in the schedule to the amended plaint. The boundaries and the extent are identical. The lease agreement no.222 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d also records the fact that, the said land and premises had come to Madduma Appuhami from his mother, D.Hinnihami who had owned and possessed the said land and premises. Thus, it is clear that, the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title recognized and accepted the fact that, the land and premises which are the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s action are a divided and distinct land and premises. It is also evident that, the land and premises claimed by the defendants are another and separate premises as set out in the deed no.1519 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd23\u201d and deed no. 7404 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d which the 1A substituted defendant-appellant-petitioner/appellant relies on. To sum up, the land and premises claimed by the plaintiff and described in the schedule to the amended plaint and the land and premises claimed by the 1A substituted defendant-appellant-petitioner/appellant and described in the second schedule to the amended answer, are two divided and distinct properties which have been separately owned and possessed for several decades. The defendant\u2019s predecessor in title has recognized and accepted that fact when he took the land and premises claimed by the plaintiff on rent from the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title upon the lease agreement marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d. In fact, the long history of this case shows that, the defendant too initially accepted this fact and admitted that she was the tenant of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in",
