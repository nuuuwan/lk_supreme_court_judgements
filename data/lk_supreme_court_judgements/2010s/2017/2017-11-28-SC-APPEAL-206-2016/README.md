Notices have been sent to the2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent and the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent on 9.9.2015

and 19.11.2015. But they have not responded to the said notices. The 1st Plaintiff-

3

Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the1st Plaintiff-Appellant)

and the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the 2nd Plaintiff) filed action bearing Number 2057/L in the District Court of

Mathugama to get a declaration that the road described in the 2nd schedule to the

Plaint is a private road and the to prevent the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondent) from using the

said road.

The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 6.1.2009 dismissed the

Plaint. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant appealed

to the Civil Appellate High Court (hereinafter referred to as the High Court). The

High Court by its judgment dated 29.7.2015 dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment of the High Court, the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant appealed to this

court. This court by its order dated 2.11.2016 granted leave to appeal on questions

of law stated in 18(a) and 18(e) of the Petition of Appeal dated 30.8.2015 which

are set out below.

1. Did the High Court err by holding that the disputed road way is to be

considered as a public road as the said right of way is being used by the

Public?

2. Did the High Court err in failing to consider that for a road to be a public

road it should either be used as such from time immemorial or that there

should be clear evidence of vesting such road way in a local authority.

The Defendant-Respondent in the District Court took up the position that the

disputed road was a public road. Therefore, the most important question that must

be decided in this case is whether the disputed road is a public road or a private

road. The 1st Plaintiff-Appellant in her evidence took up the position that the

4

disputed road was shown as Lot No.6 and 7 in plan No.1254 of H.S Samarasekara

Licensed Surveyor marked as P2(a) which had been produced in DC Mathugama

Case No.404. The No. 6 and 7 were declared as a common road among allottees in

Partition Case No.404 in DC Mathugama (marked as P9). If it is a public road, this

road would have been excluded in the Partition case. But no such thing was done.

In DC Kalutara L202, parties entered a settlement to the effect that the disputed

road in this case was a private road. The above evidence was given by the 1st

Plaintiff-Appellant. The Defendant-Respondent in his answer filed in this case

(page 58) took up the position that the disputed road was a portion of a public road

known as Devamulla-Kurunduwatta-Diyagantota Road which has been vested with

the Village Council by Gazette No.12182 dated 12.8.1960 marked V2 (page 399).

A perusal of the aforementioned gazette reveals that the Local Authority had

resolved to repair and maintain the Devamulla-Kurunduwatta-Diyagantota Road.

But this road has not been vested with the Local Authority. Senadheera Archchige

Pathmasiri who is an officer attached to the Local Authority Bulathsinhala at page

295 and 296 sated in evidence that Devamulla-Kurunduwatta-Diyagantota Road

had not been vested with the Local Authority. Therefore, it appears that the stand

taken up by the Defendant-Respondent is not correct. The learned Judges of the

High Court have observed that the disputed road was being used as a Public Road.

But it is to be noted that no such vesting was done by the aforementioned gazette.

The learned District Judge has observed that even without a vesting order with

consent of parties a private road can be converted to a Public Road. Where is the

consent of parties in this case? The1st Plaintiff-Appellant and the 2nd Plaintiff seek

a declaration in this case to the effect that the disputed road is a public road. In this

connection it is relevant to consider the judicial decision in Allishamy Vs

Arnolishamy (1898) I Thambya Reports 26 which was quoted with approval in the

case of Samarasinghe Vs Chairman VC Matara 34 NLR 39 wherein it was

5

observed thus: “No amount use by the public is sufficient to make a road a public

road where road was made within the memory of man.”

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the1st Plaintiff-Appellant and

the 2nd Plaintiff have proved their case on a balance of probability and that the

Defendant-Respondent has not proved that the disputed road was a public road. I

further hold that both courts below have reached wrong conclusions. For the

aforementioned reasons, I answer the above questions of law in the affirmative and

grant reliefs claimed by the the1st Plaintiff-Appellant and the 2nd Plaintiff in their

Plaint. I set aside both judgments of the District Court and the High Court and

allow the appeal with costs. I direct the learned District Judge to amend the decree

in accordance with this judgment.

Appeal allowed.
