Papeteries De Maudit No. 07, Avenue Ingres, 76016, Paris, France. PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT BEFORE: S. E. Wanasundera P.C., J. Anil Gooneratne J. & Nalin Perera J. COUNSEL: Hiran de Alwis with Chanaka Jayamaha and Heshan Thambimuttu for the Defendant-Appellant Geoffray Alagaratnam P.C. with Senuri de Silva For the Plaintiff-Respondent WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT FILED ON: 12.08.2014 WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT FILED ON: 05.01.2015 ARGUED ON: 16.02.2017 DECIDED ON: 02.06.2017 GOONERATNE J. This is a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Plaintiff Company, a

company in France filed action against the Defendant Company for monies due

3

to the Plaintiff Company for goods described ‘as tea bag filter papers’ being

provided to the Defendant Company and for the reason money due on same

have not been settled. The Plaintiff-Respondent Company having its business

concern in France had by a power of Attorney holder, authorised to collect and

file action on behalf of the Plaintiff Company. A Managing Director of a private

firm called Russel Fredricks Weerappah was the power of Attorney holder of the

Plaintiff Company (X2 dated 17.11.2005) and by resolution of the Plaintiff

Company (X 2a). He gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff Company and claim

the amount of money described in prayer (a) of the prayer to the plaint.

Defendant by a claim in reconvention as pleaded prayed for same but the

learned High Court Judge held that the Defendant did not prove the counter

claim and dismissed the counter claim as no evidence was led to prove the

counter claim.

The main points urged inter alia before the Supreme Court by the

Defendant-Appellant was that the action was prescribed and that there was no

written agreement. Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant demonstrated

to court that this was a case of goods sold and delivered and that there was no

account stated as submitted by Plaintiff and accepted by the High Court. As such

the action was prescribed. Parties proceeded to trial on six (6) admissions and

29 issues. I will refer to some of the admissions only as it has a bearing to the

4

appeal before this court. It was admitted that documents annexed to the plaint

X4, X9, X14 and X19 were sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff Company. These

are all orders placed by the Defendant Company requesting the Plaintiff to sell

the goods but the High Court has in the Judgment considered same to be an

admission. What was admitted was sending of the purchase orders. But

whatever it may be exchange of correspondence between parties on X24, X25,

X26 X27 and X30 were also admitted.

X24 is a request for payment by Plaintiff. X25 Managing Director of

the Defendant Company apologize for the delay in payment and states that he

will remit the sum as early as possible. X 26 dated 27.11.2002 Plaintiff states

partial payment was received and request for balance. X 27 Defendant apologise

for delay (letter dated 29.11.2002). By X30 dated 25.04.2003, Defendant accept

that they have to pay for some invoices but states fair part of the filter papers

are inferior quality and unfit for human consumption. Plaint filed on or about

28.11.2005.

Documents X25, X27, X30 are letters where the Defendant

Company admit liability for the goods imported, and states amounts due would

be settled. X3A is a statement of accounts for the transaction during 2001-2002.

There is no doubt that the amount due need to be settled by the Defendant. The

question is whether the action is prescribed? If the case falls within Section 6 of

5

the Prescription Ordinance based on written contract etc., the period would be

6 years and Plaintiff would be entitled for Judgment

If the case falls within Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance for

goods sold and delivered prescriptive period would be a period of one year to

institute action. Learned High Court Judge gives his reasons and consider the

transaction based on 4 Purchase Orders where the goods were delivered to the

Defendant Company. It is stated that the invoices, packing lists and the bill of

lading in respect of those 4 orders were marked in evidence and produced in

court. It is also stated that the above documents are admissible in evidence

though the Defendant takes the view that there is no proof of such documents

and or the documents were not proved. I do not think it is correct since a witness

from the Commercial Bank, one Somananda gave evidence on invoices, packing

lists and the Bills of Lading as those documents were produced to the Bank and

goods cleared from the warehouse as the goods imported on D/A terms. As such

goods were delivered to the Defendant Company. I am inclined to accept the

reasoning of the High Court on this aspect where provisions of Section 65 of the

Evidence Ordinance has been considered, in circumstances where secondary

evidence could be led.

6

I do agree that invoices, packing list and Bills of Lading are evidence

before the trial court and secondary evidence of same could be led without any

doubt (Section 65(1) and (7) of the Evidence Ordinance)

Defendant-Appellant argued that this is a series of transactions,

between parties of goods sold and delivered and each item of purchase

constitutes a separate transactions, and attempted to establish that it is a

transaction of goods sold and delivered. The action is prescribed in one year.

Entirety of the facts and circumstances and conduct of parties,

admission of liability are all matters to be considered, in order to decide the

nature of the transaction. It is a written contract, and an action would be

prescribed in 6 years. Even though the case in hand is based on 4 Purchase

Orders, Plaintiff’s claim is based on all orders. I have considered the lengthy

written submissions of the Defendant. I am not inclined to accept the argument

that this is only a case of goods sold and delivered.

Defendant Company made no payments and the goods had been

shipped on four consignments subsequent to the said purchase orders which

were accepted. Based on the orders, invoices, packing list and Bills of Lading are

all written documents on which the transaction proceeded and which was

between parties. I am more inclined to accept the argument of the Plaintiff

Company that having taken the entirety of the facts of the case into

7

consideration and not in isolation, I do agree that the transaction emanated

from a written contract and not on a running account. In order to constitute a

written promise contract, bargain or an agreement, no specific form of writing

is required. Vide Ceylon Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Diesel and Motor Engineers

Co. Ltd. 79(1) SLR 5.

I note that the claim of the Plaintiff as pleaded and in the

correspondence is for the four transactions based on orders, invoices, packing

lists and Bills of Lading. I am also fortified in my views having perused the

authority cited from ‘The Law of Contracts’ - Prof. Weeramantry Pg. 826

Prof. Weeramantry in his book titled the ‘Law of Contract’ at page 826 stated that, Instances

of writing which have been held to constitute written agreements are;

 “an acknowledgement of liability to pay a sum due for goods bought on credit

followed by a statement”,

 “we shall definitely pay this bill by the end of this month”

 a written contract to supply a specified quantity of goods at a specified price, and

containing other conditions as to the payment of an advance and the recovery of

damages and an offer in writing to a person to pay certain charges for the supply of a

service or commodity on the faith of which the supplier makes the supply”.

There was another point on the question of locus standi urged on

behalf of the Defendant-Appellant. Chapter V of the Civil Procedure Code deals

with recognised agents and Attorney-at-Law. An agent with a special authority

to represent his principle in matters in connection with a particular trade or

8

business is a recognised agent within the meaning of Section 25(b) of the Civil

Procedure Code. Section 25(b) was not intended to refer only to persons who

hold general powers of Attorney authorising them to represent the principle in

every conceivable kind of transactions and in connection with every kind of legal

proceeding. Lanka Estate Agency Vs. Corea 52 NLR 477.

Section 25(b) and (c ) of the Civil Procedure Code reads thus:

(b) persons holding general powers of Attorney from parties not resident

within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court within which limits

the appearance or application is made or act done, authorising them to

make such appearances and applications, and do such acts on behalf of

such parties; which power, or a copy thereof certified by an Attorney-at-

Law or notary, shall in each case be filed in the Court.

(c) persons carrying on trade or business for and in the names of parties not

resident within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court within which

limits the appearance or application is made or act done, in matters

connected with such trade or business only, where no other agent is

expressly authorised to make such appearances and applications and do

such acts.

The documents relating to power of Attorney X2 and X2(a) were

produced in evidence without an objection. As such in view of the above

9

provisions of law I have to conclude that the witness for the Plaintiff Weerappa

holds a valid Power of Attorney to act on behalf of the Plaintiff Company.

The first purchase order is dated 21.09.2001. Plaint filed on

28.11.2005. This is well within time. There are three letters of the Defendant

Company admitting liability. By X25 Defendant having admitted liability states

we will be starting to make payment from next week. X27 Defendant states they

will do their best to remit the sum as early as possible. X 30 as mentioned above,

Defendant admit that they have to pay for some invoices but attempt to

complain of the quality of goods. It was the position in the High Court that the

Defendant did not lead any evidence to prove their counter claim, and it was

dismissed by court. Further after a lapse of time by X30 dated 30.05.2003 quality

problems were raised for the first time and Defendant had not substantiated

such a quality issue. This is an after thought and the Defendant could not place

any evidence before the High Court to establish any such quality issue. Further

the claim of the Plaintiff was for the entire sum due. I note that issue Nos. 17 to

23 relating to quality issue raised by the Defendant, has been answered by the

learned High Court Judge as ‘not proved’.

The correspondence between parties indicate the true nature of

the transaction. X25 and X27 concedes the total sums due on the transaction.

X26 makes reference to two invoices 15, 922 and 16754 and the amount due is

10

indicated. Further X26 dated 22.11.2002 refer to the other two invoices already

due for an urgent payment. X27 is a reply to X26, and X27 refer to the date in

X26 vide 27.11.2002. By X27 the Defendant whilst acknowledging X26 apologise

for the delay and promise to pay. At this stage there is no complaint of bad

quality but an independent written promise to pay. An acknowledgment of a

debt in terms of Section 12 of the Prescription Ordinance may also give rise to

creation of a new contract, and take the case out of prescription.

This court having considered the material placed before court more

particularly, correspondence between parties at the relevant time would

indicate the true nature of the transaction.

As such I affirm the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge and

dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
