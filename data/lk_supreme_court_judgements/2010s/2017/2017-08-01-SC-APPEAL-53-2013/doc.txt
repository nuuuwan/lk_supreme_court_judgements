UPALY ABEYRATHNE, J.

The Plaintiff Respondent Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) has preferred this appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Civil

Appeal of the Sabaragamuwa Province, holden at Kegalle dated 04.10.2012. By

the said judgment, the High Court has set aside the judgment of the learned

4

Additional District Judge of Kegalle dated 29.08.2011, which was delivered in

favour of the Plaintiff Appellant.

When the matter was supported for leave to appeal, this court has

granted leave on the following questions of law raised by the Appellant and the

Respondents respectively:

1. Whether the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in holding

that the 1st Defendant was a co-owner of the subject matter of the

Action?

2. Whether the Plaintiff can maintain this action for the ejectment of

the Defendant from an undivided 01 (one) acre out of a land of 07

(seven) acres in extent?

The Appellant has instituted the said action against the 1st and 2nd

Defendant Appellant Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) in

the said District Court seeking declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the Respondents therefrom. The Appellant

has averred that her father Bandiya, the predecessor in title to the said land, by

deed of gift bearing No 45595 dated 11.06.1984, gifted 01 acre of undivided land

and the house standing thereon out of a land in extent of 07 acres subject to the life

interest of said Bandiya and his wife. After the death of said Bandiya and his wife

the Appellant became the sole owner of said 01 acre and lived there. She separated

the land by a fence. On or about 12.05.1987, the Respondent having no title to the

said land had forcibly entered in to possession of the said land.

The Respondents have filed their answer denying the averments

contained in the plaint and praying for a dismissal of the Appellant’s action. They

have averred that they were living in the house on the said land permanently and

5

the Appellant’s said title deed bearing No 45595 was a forged deed. They have

further averred that the Appellant, after her marriage, did not live in the house on

the said property. However, in their answer, the Respondents have not claimed title

on deeds or by inherutance to the said land in dispute.

Prior to the trial of the case an inquiry had been held in to the

application for interim injunction sought by the Appellant restraining the

Respondents from interfering with the Appellant entering in to the said land in

dispute and taking the produce of the said land. Accordingly, an interim injunction

had been issued in favour of the Appellant.

The case has proceeded to trial on 19 issues. The Respondents have

raised issues No 9 to 17. However, issues they have not challenged the said deed of

gift bearing No 45595 in the said issues, which was referred to in their answer as a

forged deed. The Appellant and her husband had given evidence at the trial. They

had produced documents marked P 1 to P 8 inclusive of the said title deed No

45595 of the Appellant and also their marriage certificate to establish that the

Appellant had gone on a binna marriage. The Respondents have not challenged the

said binna marriage certificate too. In her evidence, the Appellant has stated that

after the said marriage, she was living in her father’s house put up on the said land

in dispute with her husband. Later, her father gifted the said land to her by the said

deed of gift bearing No 45595. Upon the death of her father, said Bandiya, the

Respondents came to the said house in order to attend the funeral. After the

funeral, she became unconscious very often due to a ghostly influence and therefor

she moved to her husband’s house situated at Meepitiya on 07.05. 1987 for

medical treatment. Hence, she had requested the Respondents to stay in the said

house to look after the house during her absence. On 12.05.1987, when she

6

returned to her said house subsequent to treatments she was chased out by the

Respondents from the said house. Appellant’s husband, Gunasinghe too has given

evidence.

The Respondents have closed their case leading the evidence of the 1st

Respondent Malani. They have not produced any documentary proof of the facts

alleged by them. In her evidence, the Respondent has admitted that she had gone

on a diga marriage whilst the Appellant had gone on a binna marriage. The 1st

Respondent has further stated that after her marriage, in 1979, she came in to the

occupation of the said house and the Appellant was residing at Meepitiya. Whilst

taking the said position, the Respondent has admitted the extract of the electoral

register produced marked P 8. According to P 8 her residence was at Dampella.

She has further admitted that consequent to the death of her father said Bandiya the

Appellant fell ill and went to Meepitiya for treatment and returned to the premises

in dispute. Although the issue No 17 has been raised on prescriptive title, the 1st

Respondent has not given evidence on that basis. The 1st Respondent whilst

admitting her diga marriage has claimed the title of the said property on the basis

of her binna marriage. She said that she is living in the said house in dispute with

her father and she is entitled to the said property on inheritance.

In this regard, the Respondents should have adduced evidence to

prove that the 1st Respondent had gone on a binna marriage and thereby she

became entitled to her father’s property on inheritance according to Kandiyan Law

and therefore, she is a co-owner of the said property. However, the 1st Respondent

has not produced her marriage certificate in her evidence to establish whether her

marriage was binna or diga.

7

It is interesting to note that the 1st Respondent, in her evidence has

admitted that she went on a diga marriage with Wimalaratne and moved in to

occupation of said Wimalaratna’s house. However, P 8, the extract of the electoral

register indicated that she was residing at Dampella.

On the other hand, the Respondents having led evidence on the said

basis have failed to raise issues on the said matters. Whether the 1st Respondent has

regained binna rights has to be decided on evidence. It is not a pure question of

law. Hence such matters should be raised at the trial stage. The Respondents have

failed to do so. Therefore, the Respondents are not entitled to raise such matters for

the first time in appeal.

In the case of Punchi Menike vs. Appuhamy (1917) 19 N.L.R. 358,

De Sampayo J. said: " The point to be kept in view in all cases, I think, is that the

essence of a diga marriage is the severance of the daughter from the father's family

and her entry into that of the husband, and her consequent forfeiture of any share

of the family property ; and the principle underlying the acquisition of binna rights,

as I understand it, is that the daughter is re-admitted into the father's family and

restored to her natural rights of inheritance. This of course is not a one-sided

process; the father's family must intend or at least recognize the result.”

Therefore, when there are no issues raised at the trial on the point

urged for determination, this court cannot go in to such matters at the appeal stage.

In the circumstances, the respondents’ possession of the land in dispute has

become unlawful. The Appellant, therefore, is entitled to a decree for declaration

of title against the Respondents since the Respondents are remaining in the

8

possession of the land in dispute in the capacity of trespassers. Hence, I answer the

said questions of law in favour of the Appellants.

Therefore, I set aside the said judgment of the learned High Court

Judges dated 04.10.2012 and up hold the judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge dated 29.08.2011. I allow the appeal of the Appellant with costs.

Appeal allowed.
