This is the only time the Petitioner implicates the 5th Respondent to this incident. In addition to the assault the Petitioner alleges that it was the 5th Respondent who humiliated him by showing the Petitioner to the crowd saying \u2018this is the grease devil\u2019. Thereafter the Petitioner was taken before the Medical Officer Baddegame District hospital before producing to the Magistrate, Baddegama.. According to the Petitioner he was taken in a three wheeler and he informed the Doctor that the police have assaulted him. This was brought to the notice of the 5th Respondent and he was taken back to the police station. And on their way to the police station the three wheeler was stopped at various places and he was displayed to passers-by as the \u2018grease yaka\u2019. At the police station he noticed a massive crowd was gathered there and he was again shown to the crowd stating that he is the \u2018grease yaka\u2019. On the same day (24.08.2011)at about 3.30 p.m he was taken to Baddegama Courts and again on their way to courts at Dodangoda and Sandarawala Juncions the police jeep was stopped and he was shown to the people as the \u2018grease yaka\u2019.",

The 5th Respondent was the Officer-in Charge of the police station Thelikada. When one considers the affidavit filed by the petitioner it gives the impression that the other officers were encouraged by the act of the 5th Respondent and the 5th Respondent has done nothing to prevent it. It is the Petitioner\u2019s position that when he was produced before the Doctor he complained about the assault to him. This was conveyed to the 5th Respondent by the other officers who brought the Petitioner to Doctor and they were instructed by the 5th Respondent to bring the Petitioner back to the police station without producing him before the Magistrate. Thereafter on the way back to the police station he was shown or displayed as \u2018grease yaka\u2019 to people at various places. Then again at the Thelikada police station and on the way from the police station to Courts the Petitioner was again displayed to the people at the Dodangoda Junction and Sandarawala Junctions as the \u2018grease devil\u2019. The ordeal faced by the petitioner undoubtedly is of an aggravated nature. He was made to face the public as though he was a criminal. There is no evidence placed before this court as to who was referred to by the people of this particular area as \u2018grease yaka\u2019. But the court was made to understand that the people in the said area especially the young girls and ladies were frightened by a man who came to their premises and peeped into their rooms and houses in the dark especially when they were alone in their houses. In short people in the area referred to a pervert who peeped into the rooms of the ladies at night when they were alone for sadistic pleasure. The very purpose of showing the petitioner as \u2018grease yaka\u2019 at such highly crowded places was to identify and label the Petitioner as the said pervert to the public and humiliate the petitioner. And this was done several times. The Petitioner has stated that the 1st to 4th Respondents showed him as \u2018grease yaka\u2019 to the people gathered",
