    "text": "The Defendant\u2013Respondent has in this instant very clearly established by his conduct that he did not wish to be a tenant of the Plaintiff-Petitioner. In this case the conduct of the Defendant-Respondent has been fundamentally inconsistent with a contract of tenancy, and amounts to a repudiation of that presumed contract, therefore the Plaintiff-Petitioner has the right to accept the Defendant\u2019s repudiation of the tenancy and to proceed against him as a trespasser. The Learned Judges of the Civil Appellate Court has erred in law when they held that the Plaintiff-Petitioner\u2019s action of rei vindication is misconceived in law and that the Plaintiff-Petitioner would have filed an action under the rent Act against the Defendant-respondent who has repudiated the contract of tenancy.",
