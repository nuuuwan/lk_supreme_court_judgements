And the Court of Appeal judgment had been delivered on 31.07.1981.

The 3rd Defendant-Appellant\u2019s evidence clearly establish the fact that she had tried to effect the re-transfer of the land upon complying with the conditions and failed. Thereafter the Debt Conciliation Board decided P8 to be a Mortgage, which decision was quashed by the Court of Appeal on 31.07.1981. The 4th deceased Defendant and the 3rd Defendant-Appellant claimed rights from the deed marked 3V1 written in 1983 after the said judgment of the Court of Appeal. They continued to possess a part of the corpus claiming rights from the said deed marked 3V1.
