However the findings of fact of the Civil Appellate High Court are based on evaluation of facts. No sanctity attaches to such findings of fact by the said Court. In my view the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had misdirected themselves in holding that the Plaintiff had been ejected from lot No1 in Plan 12643 and that the plaintiff was ejected from the said premises due to the gross negligence or bad faith of the Defendant. The inferences drawn by the Civil Appellate High Court are not supported by evidence. (Gunewardene V.Cabral and others (1980) 2 Sri.L.R 220). On an examination of the evidence and the judgments, I am of the view that the findings of the District Judge were not unreasonable. He had the advantage of seeing and hearing witnesses giving their evidence. The Civil Appellate High Court should not have disturbed the findings of the learned District Judge and consequently should not have reversed his decision.",
