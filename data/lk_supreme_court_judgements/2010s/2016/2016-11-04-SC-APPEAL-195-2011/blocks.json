Herath Singho (1948) 49 N.L.R 108, it was held that in Section 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code the word \u201ccomplainant\u201d must mean the person who makes the \u201ccomplaint\u201d to the Magistrate. The aggrieved person or persons or the police, who have been induced by the aggrieved person or persons, could take up the grievance before Court. It was further held by Dias, J. that if the aggrieved person or persons desire to be the \u2018Complainant\u2019, section 148 (1) (a) gives him or them the right to make a \u201ccomplaint\u201d orally or in writing provided that such \u201ccomplaint\u201d , if in writing, shall be drawn and countersigned by a pleader and signed by the complainant. If the aggrieved person or persons desire to be the \u2018complainant\u2019 the Code of Criminal Procedure Act would give him the right to make a \u2018complaint\u2019 making himself the \u2018complainant\u2019. \u2018Complainant\u2019 means the person, who makes the complaint before Court. Considering the applicability of the word \u2018complainant\u2019 defined in Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to other relevant sections of the Code ,Dias ,J was of the opinion that the \u2018Aggrieved person or persons, could take up the grievance before Court. On the other hand the aggrieved person or persons may, without exercising their right to make a complaint in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, state their grievances to the police, who after inquiry decides to take up the case and institute proceedings on their own, the said police would file their \u2018complaint\u2019 and is clear that the police officers, who instituted the proceedings would become the complainant. The aggrieved person would cease to be the \u2018complainant\u2019 in such situations.",
