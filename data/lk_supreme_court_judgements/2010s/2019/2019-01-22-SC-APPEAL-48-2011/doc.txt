ARGUED & DECIDED ON : 22.01.2019

Sisira J. de Abrew, Acting CJ.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective

cases.

This is an appeal filed against the Judgment of the

learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court Judge dated 14.05.2009

wherein they affirmed the order of the learned District Judge dated

27.03.2007.

Learned District Judge in this case by the said order

refused the application to purge the default by the Defendant. This Court

by its order dated 31.03.2011 granted leave to appeal on questions of law

set out in paragraph 13 of the petition of appeal dated 16.06.2010 which

are stated below:-

(i) Did the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellate High

Court err on law when it came to the finding that there was

SC. Appeal No. 48/2011

3

no due diligence displayed on the part of the Attorney-at-Law

on behalf of the Petitioner who was assigned to appear in the

District Court of Colombo on the said date?

(ii) Did the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellate High

Court err on law when it came to the finding that filing of a

proxy on behalf of a relevant party amounts to a legal

representation in Court?

(iii) Did the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellant High

Court err in law when it did not take cognizance of the

motion dated 03.12.2004, which encompassed the proxy of

the Petitioner?

(iv) Did the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellate High

Court misdirect themselves in rejecting the bona fide

conduct of the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner who had

filed a motion dated 03.12.2004 along with the proxy (P2)?

(v). Did the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellate High

Court misdirect themselves that filing of the motion (P2) was

a clear indication that the Petitioner never intended the trial

to proceed by default?

Learned District Judge on 07.12.2004 noted that

summons had been served on the Defendant and the Defendant was

SC. Appeal No. 48/2011

absent and unrepresented. He therefore made an order to the following

effect. “The case is fixed for ex-parte trial against the Defendant. In order

to fix the case for ex-parte trial, call the case in Court No. 06 on

25.01.2005.”

According to the journal entry No. 03, the Attorney-at-

Law for the Defendant has filed a motion with a proxy. The date,

according to the said journal entry is 07.12.2004/03.12.2004. The

District Judge has noted that the Attorney-at-Law had failed to fix

relevant stamps to the proxy. However, according to journal entry No. 04,

dated 07.01.2005, the Attorney-at-Law for the Defendant has, by way of a

motion, filed a proxy with correct stamps. The learned District Judge on

the said motion has made an order to call the case on 27.01.2005 for the

answer as prayed for by the said motion. This order has been made on

07.01.2005. According to the said order in journal entry No. 04 dated

07.01.2005, the case has to be called on 27.01.2005. However, the

learned District Judge has called the case on 25.01.2005. According to

journal entry No. 05 dated 25.01.2005, the case was being called in order

to fix the matter for ex-parte. The learned District Judge has, on

25.01.2005, noted that the Defendant has filed proxy and moved for time

to file the answer.

When considering all the above matters, the most

important question that must be decided by this Court is whether the

learned District Judge fixed the case for ex-parte trial on 07.12.2004 or

25.01.2005. I now advert to the said question. According to journal entry

No. 04 dated 07.01.2005, the Attorney-at-Law for the Defendant has

moved permission of Court to file the answer and the Judge has granted a

date to file the answer. The said date was 27.01.2005.

SC. Appeal No. 48/2011

According to journal entry No. 05 dated 25.01.2005,

the case was being called in order to fix for ex-parte trial. Even according

to journal entry No. 02 dated 07.12.2004, there is an order to the effect

that the case will be called in Court No. 06 on 25.01.2005 in order to fix

the matter for ex-parte trial.

When we consider all the above matters, we hold the

view that the learned District Judge has decided to fix the case for ex-parte

trial on 25.01.2005 and not on 07.12.2004. If the learned District Judge

took a decision on 25/01/2005 to fix the case for ex-parte trial, how did

he ignore his own order made on 07.01.2005 giving a date to the

Defendant to file the answer on 27.01.2005? Therefore, fixing the case for

ex-parte trial even on 25/01/2005 is wrong.

When we consider the above matters, we hold the view

that the order made by the learned District Judge on 25.01.2005 fixing the

matter for ex-parte is wrong and cannot be accepted. Learned District

Judge however, by order dated 27.03.2007 has rejected the application of

the Defendant to purge the default. He has made the said order on the

basis that he fixed the matter for ex-parte trial on 07.12.2004. This is an

error on the part of the learned District Judge.

Learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

unfortunately too have fallen into the same error. We have earlier held

that the learned District Judge has fixed the case for ex-parte trial on

25.01.2005 and not on 07.12.2004.

SC. Appeal No. 48/2011

For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that both the

learned District Judge and the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

were wrong when they rejected the application of the Defendant to purge

the default. For the purpose of clarity, we hold that the learned District

Judge has made the order fixing the matter for ex-parte only on

25.01.2005. Therefore, the learned District Judge could not have ignored

his own order dated 07.01.2005 giving a date for the Defendant to file

answer on 27.01.2005. We have earlier pointed out that fixing the case

for ex-parte trial even on 25/01/2005 is wrong.

For the reasons, we answer questions of law Nos. 3

and 5 in the affirmative. The question of law Nos. 1, 2 and 4 do not arise

for consideration.

For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside the ex-

pate order of the learned District Judge dated 27.03.2007 and the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court Judge dated 14.05.2009.

Learned District Judge by ex-parte judgment dated

13.09.2005 has held the case in favour of the Plaintiff.

For the reason stated above, we are unable to permit

the said judgment dated 13.09.2005 to stand. We set aside the said

judgment dated 13.09.2005 as well.

SC. Appeal No. 48/2011

We direct the learned District Judge to grant an

opportunity to the Defendant to file answer and expeditiously conclude

this case.
