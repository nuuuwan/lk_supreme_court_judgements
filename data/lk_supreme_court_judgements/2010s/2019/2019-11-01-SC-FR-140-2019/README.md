4 P Padman Surasena J

The 1st Petitioner is the father of the 2nd Petitioner who is a minor and whose

admission to Grade 1 of Royal College Colombo, was sought by an

application1 made by the 1st Petitioner to the said school. Upon the 2nd

Petitioner becoming unsuccessful in securing the admission to the said

school, the 1st Petitioner has appealed to the Appeals Panel appointed by the

School authorities. The Petitioners have not been successful at the said

appeal too.

At the outset, this Court needs to bear in mind that the process of selection

of children to Public schools is conducted in accordance with the provisions

of the circular dated 31st May 2018 produced marked P 2 by the Petitioners.

The 1st Respondent also has produced the said circular marked R 1. The said

process envisaged by the said circular is a competitive process. According to

clause 6.0 of this circular, a specified percentage of children are admitted to

Grade 1 in public schools in each year, from each of the six categories set

out below.

I. 50% of children of residents in close proximity to the school,

II. 25% of children of parents who are Past Pupils of the school,

III. 15% of children who are brothers/sisters of students already studying

in the school,

IV. 05% of children of parents who are employed in an institution engaged

in work directly related to public school education under the Ministry

of Education,

V. 04% of children of parents of Government

institutions/corporations/Statutory Boards/State Banks, who are

5

transferred on the exigencies of Government service or on annual

transfer schemes,

VI. 01% of children of parents returning to the country after been abroad

for some time.

As the process of admission of children to Grade 1 in public schools is a

competitive one, the circular has devised a marking system2 relating to each

of the above categories. The school authorities, after evaluation according

to the marking scheme, prepares a list placing all the applicants according

to the marks they have scored. It is thereafter that the school authorities

decide on a cut-off mark and admit only the children who are placed above

the said cut-off mark.

In the instant case, the 1st Petitioner (father) had sought admission of his

son (the 2nd Petitioner) under the category of applicants who reside in close

proximity to the school. It would be convenient as requested by the learned

counsel for the Petitioners, to turn at this stage to some of the averments in

the affidavit dated 20th September 2019, filed by the 1st Respondent who is

the Principal of the school relevant to this application. Paragraph 11 and 12

are reproduced below for convenience.

Paragraph 11

“In terms of proximity, marks were deducted for two schools more proximate

to the Petitioner than Royal College; (i) Mahanama College and (ii) Thurstan

College Colombo. Thus the Petitioner was awarded 32 marks for proximity.”

Paragraph 12

2 Clauses 6.1 to 6.6 of P 2 (also marked R 1 by the 1st Respondent).

6 “In total, the Petitioners’ school admission application was awarded 55.2

marks. The cut off mark was 57.15 marks and hence the 2nd Petitioner was

not selected for admission to Grade 1, Royal College.”

This Court can observe that the marking scheme embodied in this circular is

designed to pave the way for the parents to admit their children to the Public

school closest to their residence more conveniently than to the others.

However, if a parent wishes to admit the child to a school of his or her choice

which is not the public school closest to his residence, then he will lose four

marks each in respect of each of the other public school situated closer to

the residence of such parent than the school of his or her choice. 3

According to paragraph 11 of the affidavit filed by the 1st Respondent the

Petitioners’ marks have been deducted in respect of two schools namely;

(i) Mahanama College and

(ii) Thurstan College Colombo.

This was on the basis that the said two schools are situated closer to the

Petitioners’ residence than Royal College. It is in this manner that the school

authorities have calculated and awarded 32 marks to the Petitioners for the

close proximity of their residence to Royal College.

However, as has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the Petitioners,

clause 7.2.4 of the circular marked P 2,4 has specified the criteria to be

adopted when making a decision to deduct marks for the presence of other

public schools situated closer to the residence of the applicant than the

school of such applicant’s choice. (i.e. the school, such applicant has applied

for). It is important to note that the said clause 7.2.4 does not authorize

3 Clause 7.2.4 of P 2 (R 1) 4 (Also marked R 2 by the 1st Respondent).

7 deduction of marks for the mere presence of other Public schools closer to

the residence of the applicant than the school of such applicant’s choice.

Accordingly, marks must be deducted only in respect of any public school

to which the child of such applicant could be admitted as per the criteria set

out in the said clause. In the instant case, marks can be deducted only in

respect of any public school to which the 2nd Petitioner could be admitted as

per the criteria set out in the said clause (clause7.2.4).

This Court bearing in mind, the provisions in clause7.2.4 must now consider

whether the deduction of four marks when evaluating the Petitioners’

application by the school authorities for the presence of Mahanama College

in closer proximity to the Petitioners’ residence than Royal College.

As has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the Petitioners, letter

dated 02nd August 2018 produced by the Petitioner marked P 27 (a) has

confirmed that Mahanama College admits only the Buddhist children.

According to the said letter, that is the reason given by Mahanama College

for the rejection of the Petitioners’ application for that school. Thus, it is clear

that Mahanama College would not have admitted the 2nd Petitioner to Grade

1 of that school under any circumstance due to the sole reason that the

Petitioners are not Buddhists. Therefore, it is clear that the deduction of four

marks from the marks of the Petitioners for the presence of Mahanama

College in closer proximity to the Petitioners’ residence than Royal College is

unlawful. This is because Mahanama College cannot be considered in terms

of clause 7.2.4 of the circular, as a school falling under the category of

schools specified in that clause for the purpose of deducting such marks.

It was the position of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that he is able

to advance several arguments to show that there are several instances

8 where School authorities have unlawfully deprived the Petitioners marks

which should have been otherwise lawfully awarded to them. However, in

view of the fact that it is less than two more marks which the Petitioners

need, to secure the admission of the 2nd Petitioner to Royal College, the

learned counsel for the Petitioners informed Court at the very

commencement of the argument, that he would be content if the Court

upholds his argument that the school authorities should not have deducted

four marks in respect of Mahanama College on the basis that Mahanama

College is situated in closer proximity to the residence of the Petitioners than

Royal College and held that Mahanama College is a school falling under the

category of schools specified in clause 7.2.4 of the circular for the purpose

of the application of the Petitioners.

As the deduction of four marks from the marks of the Petitioners for the

presence of Mahanama College in closer proximity to the Petitioners’

residence than Royal College is unlawful, the total of the marks scored by

the Petitioners in respect of their application should have been 59.2 marks.

This is well above the cut-off mark of 57.15 marks. This means that the

school authorities are obliged to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Royal College

Colombo 07.

Although the Petitioners have advanced strong arguments to establish that

they are in fact residing in the address No. 562/16 and that the premises

bearing No. 562/16 and the premises referred to as 562/16 B are one and

the same and that the Petitioners have used both numbers inter-changeably,

it would be unnecessary for this Court to make any pronouncement in that

regard as this Court is able to grant the relief prayed for by the Petitioners

in the instant application only upon the above conclusion.

9 This Court on 30-05-2019 having heard the submissions of the learned

counsel for the Petitioners and the submissions of the learned Senior State

Counsel who appeared for the Respondents, had decided to grant leave to

proceed in respect of the alleged violations of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows;

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection

of the law”.

The above facts demonstrate that the school authorities have failed to apply

the law in its correct perspective in respect of the application of the 1st

Petitioner seeking to admit his son (the 2nd Petitioner) to Royal College

Colombo 07. The respondent school authorities are obliged to adopt the

same method, the same marking system and the same yardsticks set out in

the circular marked P 2, to evaluate the application of the Petitioners also

when they select students to the classes of that school in Grade 1.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that

the Petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution have been infringed. Therefore, the Petitioners are entitled to

the declaration they have prayed from this Court.

Hence, this Court decides to;

I. declare that the failure of the 1st to 10th Respondents to admit the 2nd

Petitioner to Grade 1 of Royal College Colombo 07 has infringed the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution;

10

II. direct the 1st to 10th Respondents to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade

1 of Royal College Colombo 07 on the basis that they have scored more

marks than the cut-off mark as pointed out above.

In all the circumstances of this case, this Court decides to award neither

compensation no costs.
