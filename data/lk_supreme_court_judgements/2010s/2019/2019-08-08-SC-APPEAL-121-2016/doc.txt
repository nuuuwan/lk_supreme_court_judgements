Written submission tendered on : 9.8.2016 by the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant 6.8.2017 by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Decided on: 8.8.2019 Sisira J. de Abrew, J This is an appeal against the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated

1.7.2014 wherein the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

affirmed the order of the District Judge of Colombo dated 28.1.204 wherein he

fixed the matter for ex-parte trial. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the

Civil Appellate High Court the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant has appealed to

the court. This court by its order dated 14.6.2016 granted leave to appeal on

questions of law set out in paragraphs 41(a),(b),(c) and (e) of the Petition of

Appeal dated 11.8.2014 which are set out below.

1. 41 (a)(i) - Has the learned trial Judge made a grave procedural error in

fixing DC Colombo Case No.6693/Spl for ex-parte trial on 28.1.2004?

2. 41(a)(ii) – In any event, did the learned trial Judge not have jurisdiction

to fix DC Colombo Case No.6693/Spl for ex-parte trial on 28.1.2004?

3. 41(a)(iiI) – If so, are the proceedings in Case No.6693/Spl subsequent to

28.1.2004, a nullity?

4. 41(b)(i) – Are the circumstances pleaded in the Petition of the Petitioner

filed in WP/HCCA/COL/33/2012/RA constitute special and/or

extraordinary circumstances shocking the conscience of court warranting

SC Appeal 121/2016

the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by Their Lordships of the High

Court of Civil Appeal in favour of the Petitioner?

5. 41(b)(ii) – Do the circumstances pleaded in the Petition ex facie

establish that a positive miscarriage of justice has been caused to the

Petitioner due to fundamental procedural error caused due to the Order

of the learned trial Judge in fixing the DC Colombo Case No.6693/Spl

for ex-parte trial on 28.1.2004?

6. 41(b)(iii) – If so, have Their Lordships of the High Court of Civil

Appeal erred in law in holding that the Petitioner is not entitled to

exercise revisionary jurisdiction due to the alleged delay on the part of

the Petitioner?

7. 41(c) – Was the Respondent bound and obliged in law to establish the

case against the Petitioner on a balance of probability, even in an ex-

parte trial?

8. 41(e) – Is the judgment of Their Lordships of the High Court of Civil

Appeal dated 1.7.2014, contrary to well established legal principles?

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Respondent) filed a case in the District Court of Colombo moving court to

issue an interim injunction and an enjoining order preventing the Defendant-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Petitioner)

selling the bus bearing Registration Number 62-4959. The learned District

Judge by order dated 3.10.2003 refused to grant an interim injunction and fixed

SC Appeal 121/2016

5

the matter for answer on 3.12.2003. On 2.12.2003 the Plaintiff-Respondent

filed a motion requesting permission of court to file an amended plaint on

3.12.2003. The learned District Judge on 2.12.2003 made an order to file the

motion and mention on 3.12.2003. It has to be stated here that no amended

plaint was filed on 2.12.2003. The journal entry dated 3.12.2003 carried the

following matters. “Amended plaint is being filed. Objections (if any) and

answer on 28.1.2004.” According to the above journal entry the answer should

be filed on 28.1.2004. On 28.1.2004, the learned District Judge accepted the

amended plaint and fixed the case for ex-parte trial. The journal entry dated

28.1.2004 carries the following material. “Objection and answer – No (not

filed). The defendant is absent. No legal representation for the defendant.

Amended plaint is accepted. Case is fixed for ex-parte trial. Ex-parte trial is

fixed for 5.3.2004.” There is nothing to indicate that the amended plaint was

accepted on 3.12.2003. According to the above journal entry the amended

plaint was accepted only on 28.1.2004. What is the basis on which that the

learned District Judge on 28.1.2004 fixed the case for ex-parte trial? If the

answer had been filed when the case was called on 28.1.2004, the learned

District Judge could not have fixed the case ex-parte trial even if the

Defendant-Petitioner was absent and unrepresented. If the answer had been

filed when the case was called on 28.1.2004, it would have been the duty of the

learned District Judge to fix the case for trial even if the Defendant-Petitioner

was absent and unrepresented. Then what was the basis on which the case was

fixed for ex-parte trial when it was called on 28.1.2004? It appears that the

basis was the failure to file the answer. Could the Defendant-Petitioner have

filed the answer on 28.1.2004? Since the amended plaint has been accepted by

SC Appeal 121/2016

6

court on 28.1.2004, the Defendant-Petitioner could not have filed an answer on

the amended plaint on 28.1.2004. Since the court has accepted the amended

plaint on 28.1.2004, it was the duty of court to have given an opportunity to the

Defendant-Petitioner to file an answer on the amended plaint. But the learned

District Judge did not give this opportunity to the Defendant-Petitioner and

fixed the case for ex-parte trial. Therefore it is seen from the above material

that the answer on the amended plaint was not due on 28.1.2004. The learned

District Judge on 28.1.2004 could not have fixed the case for ex-parte trial

even on the basis that the Defendant-Petitioner was absent and unrepresented

because the acceptance of the amended plaint has taken place only on

28.1.2004. When the amended plaint is accepted, the original plaint does not

exist. Then it becomes the duty of court to act under Section 55 of the Civil

Procedure Code and serve summons on the defendant if the defendant is absent

in court. If the defendant is present in court, the court should give him an

opportunity to file his answer on the amended plaint. The learned District

Judge has not taken the above steps. Therefore it is seen from the above

material that the District Court has not fixed a date to file answer on the

amended plaint. The learned District Judge on the day that the amended plaint

was accepted without fixing a date to file an answer, has fixed the case for ex-

parte trial which is wrong. At this stage it is relevant to consider section 84 of

the Civil Procedure Code which reads as follows.

If the defendant fails to file his answer on or before the day fixed for the filing of the

answer, or on or before the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the answer or

having filed his answer, if he fails to appear on the day fixed (or the hearing of the

action, and if the court is satisfied that the defendant has been duly served with

summons, or has received due notice of the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the

SC Appeal 121/2016

7

answer, or of the day fixed for the hearing of the action, as the case may be, and if,

on the occasion of such default of the defendant, the plaintiff appears, then the court

shall proceed to hear the case ex parte forthwith, or on such other day as the court

may fix.

Under Section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code, the court is empowered to fix a

case for ex-parte trial if the defendant fails to file his answer on or before the

day fixed for the filling of the answer or on or before the day fixed for the

subsequent filing of the answer. This is one of the grounds discussed in Section

84 of the Civil Procedure Code. After the amended plaint was accepted, did the

court fix a date for filing of the answer? The answer is clearly in the negative.

It has to be noted here that after accepting the amended plaint on 28.1.2004, the

court without fixing a date to file the answer, fixed the case for ex-parte trial.

There was no opportunity for the Defendant-Petitioner to file his answer on the

amended plaint since the court has failed to fix a date for the answer on the

amended plaint. Therefore the argument that the Defendant-Petitioner has

failed to file his answer on or before the day fixed for filing of the answer or on

or before the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the answer cannot be

accepted. For the above reasons I hold that the Defendant-Petitioner has not

violated Section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code; that the learned District Judge

on 28.1.2004 could not have fixed the case for ex-parte trial; and that the order

made by the learned District Judge on 28.1.2004 fixing the case for ex-parte

trial without giving an opportunity for the defendant to file his answer is

wrong, a nullity and has violated a fundamental rule. Failure by the District

Court to give an opportunity for the Defendant-Petitioner to file his answer

upon acceptance of the amended plaint is a violation of a fundamental rule.

SC Appeal 121/2016

For the benefit of the trial Judges and legal practitioners of this country I would

like to set down here the following guidelines.

1. When an amended plaint is accepted by court, the court cannot on the

same day fix the case for ex-parte trial on the basis that the defendant is

absent or he did not file the answer.

2. When an amended plaint is accepted by court, the court must give an

opportunity for the defendant to file his answer.

3. When an amended plaint is accepted by court, it becomes the duty of

court to summon the defendant if he is absent in court because the

amended plaint has to be considered as a new plaint.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Petitioner admitted in court that

the application filed by the Defendant-Petitioner to purge the default under

Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code has been rejected by the District

Court. For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that the order made by the

District Court on 28.1.2004 fixing the case for ex-parte trial is wrong and a

nullity.

The learned District Judge took up the ex-parte trial and delivered the judgment

dated 20.4.2004 giving relief prayed for in paragraph (a) of the amended plaint.

Then the learned District Judge by the said judgment ordered the Defendant-

Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.1,344,192/- and Rs.3000/- per day from

4.12.2003 until vehicle bearing registration No.62-4959 is returned to the

Plaintiff-Respondent. The learned District Judge by the said Judgment dated

20.4.2004 has not granted the other reliefs claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent.

SC Appeal 121/2016

The reliefs claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent that he (the Plaintiff-

Respondent) is the registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration No. 62-

4959 and that the order compelling the Defendant-Petitioner to hand over the

said vehicle to the Plaintiff-Respondent were not granted.

It is undisputed that the Plaintiff-Respondent purchased the vehicle on a hire

purchase agreement signed with the Defendant-Petitioner and that the

Defendant-Petitioner seized the said vehicle from the possession of the

Plaintiff-Respondent as he failed to pay the monthly installments. This has

been admitted by the Plaintiff-Respondent in her evidence. The interim

injunction claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent in her original plaint directing

the Defendant-Petitioner not to sell the above vehicle was rejected by the

learned District Judge by his order dated 3.10.2003. Learned President’s

Counsel for the Defendant-Petitioner submitted that the Defendant-Petitioner

sold the vehicle since the above relief claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent had

been rejected by court and as such the said vehicle is not in the possession of

the Defendant-Petitioner. Learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-

Petitioner submitted that in terms of the ex-parte judgment of the District

Court, the Defendant-Petitioner has to give Rs.3000/- per day to the Plaintiff-

Respondent until the vehicle is returned to the Plaintiff-Respondent but the

Defendant-Petitioner is not in a position to hand over the vehicle since it has

been sold. Thus it is seen that if the ex-parte judgment of the District Court

dated 20.4.2004 is affirmed, the Defendant-Petitioner has to pay Rs.3000/- per

day to the Plaintiff-Respondent without any terminal date. This ex-parte

judgment of the District Court dated 20.4.2004 has been delivered as a result of

the order of the District Court dated 28.1.2004 fixing the case for ex-parte trial.

SC Appeal 121/2016

I have to ask the question whether the order dated 28.1.2004 and the ex-parte

judgment dated 20.4.2004 shock the conscience of court. I have to answer this

question in the affirmative. If an order or a judgment of the trial court shocks

the conscience of court, the appellate court should, in revision, interfere with

such an order or judgment. This view is supported by the following judicial

decisions.

Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel and Others [2004] 1 SLR 284 at page 287(CA) it

was held as follows.

“In any event, for this Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged

must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly

react to it. In other words the order complained of is of such a nature which would

have shocked the conscience of Court.”

Vanik Incorporation Ltd Vs Jayasekara [1997] 2 SLR 365 (CA) Justice

Edussuriya held as follows.

“Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred

due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only when a strong case

is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.”

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have concluded that

failure on the part of the learned District Judge to give an opportunity for the

Defendant-Petitioner to file an answer has caused a grave injustice but refused

to intervene with the order of the learned District Judge on the ground of delay

on the part of the Defendant-Petitioner. I note that the revision application has

been filed in the Civil Appellate High Court after eight years of the order fixing

SC Appeal 121/2016

11

the case for ex-parte trial. As I pointed out earlier, the Defendant-Petitioner, in

terms of the ex-parte judgment, has to pay Rs.3000/- per day to the Plaintiff-

Respondent without any terminal date. As a result of a judgment or an order in

the lower court if a party in a case has to make payments without a terminal

date, delay in seeking revisionary jurisdiction of the Appellate Court should not

operate as a bar for the Appellate Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction.

This view is supported by the judgment of the GPS de Silva CJ in the case of

Gnanapantithen and Another Vs Balanayagam and Another [1998] I SLR 391

wherein His Lordship held as follows.

“There was a total want of investigation of title. The circumstances were strongly

indicative of a collusive action. In the result, there was a miscarriage of justice in the

case, and the appellants were entitled to a revision of the judgment of the District

Judge notwithstanding delay in seeking relief.

The question whether delay is fatal to an application in revision depends on the facts

and circumstances of the case. Having regard to the very special and. exceptional

circumstances of the case the appellants were entitled to the exercise of the

revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal.”

I have earlier held that the order of the learned District Judge fixing the case

for ex-parte trial is a nullity. If an order of lower court is a nullity, the

Appellate Court should interfere with such an order in the exercise of its

revisionary jurisdiction. In the present case the Civil Appellate High Court

having observed the fact that failure on the part of the learned District Judge to

give an opportunity for the Defendant-Petitioner to file his answer has caused

grave injustice to the Defendant-Petitioner refused to intervene on the ground

SC Appeal 121/2016

12

of delay. When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the

learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court were wrong when they

refused to interfere with the order of the learned District Judge dated

28.1.2004. For the above reasons, I hold that the judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court dated 1.7.2014 is wrong and should be set aside.

For the aforementioned reasons, I exercising the appellate powers of this court,

set aside the order of the learned District Judge dated 28.1.2004 fixing the case

for ex-parte trial. Since I set aside the said order of the learned District Judge,

the ex-parte judgment of the District Court dated 20.4.2004 should also be set

aside and is hereby set aside. Since the order dated 28.1.2004 of the learned

District Judge fixing the case for ex-parte trial is set aside, the judgment of the

Civil Appellate High Court dated 1.7.2014 which has the effect of affirming

the said order of the District Court is also set aside.

I direct the learned District Judge to give an opportunity to the Defendant-

Petitioner to file his answer on the amended plaint and proceed with the trial

without delay.

The Defendant-Petitioner in his petition of appeal filed in this court has moved

for an order to return the money that the he has paid to the Plaintiff-Respondent

in terms of the ex-parte judgment dated 20.4.2004. Since we set aside the ex-

parte judgment dated 20.4.2004 the payments made in terms of said judgment

should also be returned by the Plaintiff-Respondent to the Defendant-

Petitioner. We are unable to determine the amount paid by the Defendant-

Petitioner to the Plaintiff-Respondent as the relevant material has not been

attached to the petition of appeal. Therefore we cannot state the amount in this

SC Appeal 121/2016

13

judgment. The Defendant-Petitioner is entitled to recover the amount he had

paid to the Plaintiff-Respondent in terms of the ex-parte judgment. The learned

District Judge at the end of the main trial is directed to calculate this amount on

the evidence led before the District Court and make an appropriate order. I

would like to state here that this judgment should not be considered as a licence

to cure defects in cases where there is delay in seeking revisionary jurisdiction

of the Appellate Court because each case must be considered on its own merit.

In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the above questions of law

as follows.

The questions of law set out in paragraph 41(a) (i) and (ii) of the petition of

appeal are answered in the affirmative.

The questions of law set out in paragraph 41(a)(iii) of the petition of appeal are

answered as follows. “The orders of the learned District Judge dated 28.1.2004

and 20.4.2004 are wrong.”

The questions of law set out in paragraph 41(b)(i) are answered as follows.

“The orders of the learned District Judge dated 28.1.2004 and 20.4.2004 shock

conscience of court.”

The questions of law set out in paragraph 41(b)(ii) and (iii) are answered in the

affirmative.

The question of law set out in paragraph 41(c) does not arise for consideration.

The question of law set out in paragraph 41(e) is answered as follows. The

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 1.7.2004 is wrong.
