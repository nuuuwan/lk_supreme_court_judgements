The Plaintiff - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Plaintiff) filed in the District Court of Chilaw, a plaint in terms of

provisions in chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code. This is to recover a

sum of money amounting to Rs. 4,000,000/= form the Defendant

Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Defendant). The said amount is the amount mentioned in the cheque

dated 1998-10-21 bearing No. 205090 handed over to the Plaintiff by the

Defendant as a settlement of a debt obtained by the Defendant from the

Plaintiff.

The Defendant had thereafter sought leave of Court in terms of the

provisions contained in the said chapter of the civil Procedure Code, to

appear and defend the action without any condition. However, the learned

Additional District Judge by his order dated 16th August 2006 had only

granted the Defendant leave of Court to appear and defend the action

subject to the condition of depositing in Court, the full amount (Rs.

4,000,000/=) claimed by the Plaintiff. The said order dated 16th August

2006 has been produced marked (P 4) in this Court.

Admittedly, the Defendant has never challenged the above order. Thus,

the said order dated 16th August 2006 pronounced by the learned

Additional District Judge remains valid to date.

Perusal of the journal entries1 of the District Court case record clearly

shows that the learned District Judge has granted on the application of

the Defendant, several further opportunities for the Defendant to deposit

the said amount of money and file answer in order that he could defend

the action. However, the Defendant without making use of the said

opportunities (granted to him by the learned Additional District Judge)

had thereafter chosen to default appearing in Court. It was in these

circumstances that the learned Additional District Judge on 2007-03-28,

had proceeded to enter a decree in favour of the Plaintiff as per the

prayers of the plaint.

The Appellant had thereafter, up until the year 2013, for the reasons only

known to him had maintained a stoic silence. It was on 27 - 08 - 2013,2

that the appellant had filed the revision application bearing No. NWP/

HCCA/ KUR/ 20/ 2013 (Rev), in the Provincial High Court of North

Western Province holden at Kurunegala to challenge the order dated 16th

August 2006 pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge. Upon

the said revision application being supported, the Provincial High Court by

its order dated 22nd October 2013 has refused to issue notices on the

Respondent. The Provincial High Court has based the said refusal on the

following grounds.

i. The Petitioner has not placed any exceptional circumstance, which

warrants the Provincial High Court to invoke its revisionary

jurisdiction.

ii. There is no merit in the said application.

1 Journal entries dated 2006-10-04, 2006-11-08 and 2007-01-10. 2 According to the order dated 22-10-2013 of the Provincial High Court.

iii. There is an undue delay in filing the said revision application.

This Court by its order dated 03-12-2014 has granted special leave to

appeal on the following questions of law.

i. Their Lordships in the Civil Appellate High Court of North Western

Province erred in law by coming to a wrong conclusion that they are

barred by its predecessors decision as exceptional circumstances

have not been established.

ii. Have their Lordships in the Civil Appellate North Western Province

erred in law by not judicially evaluating the facts pertaining to this

case.

iii. Has the learned Additional District Judge of Chillaw erred in law by

making judgment dated 16th August 2006 as it was not supported

by evidence?

Before this Court lays its hands on the above questions of law, it would

be prudent to briefly consider some of the provisions in chapter LIII of

the Civil Procedure Code under which the learned Additional District Judge

had made the order dated 16th August 2006. Section 704 of the Civil

Procedure Code states as follows;

Section 704

(1) In any case in which the plaint and summons are in such forms

respectively, the defendant shall not appear or defend the action

unless he obtains leave from the Court as hereinafter mentioned

so to appear and defend; and in default of his obtaining such

leave or of appearance and defence in pursuance thereof, the

Plaintiff shall be entitled to a decree for any sum not exceeding

6

the sum mentioned in the summons, together with interest to

the date of the payment, and such costs as the Court may allow

at the time of making the decree.

(2) The defendant shall not be required, as a condition of his being

allowed to appear and defend, to pay into Court the sum,

mentioned in the summons, or to give security therefor, unless

the Court thinks his defence not to be prima facie sustainable, or

feels reasonable doubt as to its good faith.

This Court has perused the affidavit filed (in the District Court) by the

Plaintiff, the copies of the documents the Plaintiff had referred to in his

affidavit, the affidavit filed by the Defendant seeking leave of Court to

appear and defend the action without any condition and the order dated

16th August 2006 made by the learned Additional District Judge only

granting the Defendant leave of Court to appear and defend the action

subject to the condition of depositing the full amount (Rs. 4,000,000/=)

claimed by the Plaintiff in Court. It is the view of this Court that the learned

Additional District Judge is correct when he made the order dated 16th

August 2006 as the material the Plaintiff has produced before Court and

the contents of the affidavit filed by the Defendant enable the Court to

form a view;

a) that the defence advanced by the Defendant is not prima facie

sustainable, and

b) that there is a reasonable doubt as to its good faith.

It would suffice for this Court to stop at that since this is only an appeal

against an order of refusal by the Provincial High Court to issue notices

7

in a revision application when it was supported before Court and not

an appeal against a final judgment.

In these circumstances, this Court answers the question of law No. (iii) in

the negative.

This Court has also perused the order dated 22nd October 2013 made by

the Provincial High Court refusing to issue notices on the Respondent.

The basis upon which the Provincial High Court has refused to issue

notices on the Respondent has already been stated in this judgment. The

Provincial High Court has given detailed reasons for refusing to entertain

the revision application. The Defendant has not adduced before this Court

any valid basis for this Court to interfere with the said Provincial High

Court order. Thus, it is the view of this Court that this is a frivolous appeal

lodged by the Defendant for collateral purposes. Thus, in the above

circumstances this Court answers the question of law No. (ii) also in the

negative.

This Court observes that the question No. I formulated by the Defendant

is not sufficiently clear. On the other hand this Court is of the view that

the nature of question No (i), despite whatever its real meaning, would

not be directly relevant for the disposal of this appeal and that answering

the questions of law No I and II would be more than sufficient to dispose

this appeal. Therefore, this Court would not proceed to answer the

question of law No. (i).

In these circumstances, this Court affirms both the order dated 22nd

October 2013 pronounced by the Provincial High Court of North Western

Province holden at Kurunegala and order dated 16th August 2006

8

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Chillaw. This Court

proceeds to dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/= payable

by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.
