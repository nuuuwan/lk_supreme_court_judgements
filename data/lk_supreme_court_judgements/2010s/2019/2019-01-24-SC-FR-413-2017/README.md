ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 24.01.2019.

SISIRA J. DE ABREW, ACTING CJ.

The Petitioner by his petition dated 15.11.2017 has complained to this Court

that his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution

have been violated by the 1st Respondent. This Court by its order dated

28.03.2018 granted Leave to Proceed for the alleged violation of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution. Petitioner complains that his child was not admitted to

Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo in the year 2014. We note that the 2nd

Respondent the Secretary to the Ministry of Education has made a direction to

the Principal, Vishaka Vidyalaya (the 1st Respondent) by letter dated

22.06.2014 to admit the Petitioners child to Vishaka Vidyalaya. This

document has been produced as P7. However, the Principal of Vishaka

Vidyalaya( the 1st Respondent) did not admit the Petitioners child as directed

by the 2nd Respondent. The 1st Respondent has made an endorsement on the

letter marked P7 as a suggestion to the 2nd Respondent that she would admit

the Petitioners child to Grade II in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2015, as the

child has, at that time, been admitted to Musaeus College. We note that the

1st Respondent has failed to comply with the direction given by the 2nd

Respondent who is the Secretary to the Ministry of Education. Although, the

1st Respondent has made an endorsement which is reflected in P7 that she

would take the petitioners child to Grade II in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year

2015, she has failed to comply with the said endorsement. Although, the 1st

Respondent failed to admit the petitioners child to Grade II in Vishaka

Vidyalaya in the year 2015, she has admitted a child named Samaratunga to

Grade II in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2015. This is evident by document

marked P16a which is a letter addressed to the 1st Respondent by the 2nd

Respondent. The date of P16a is 23.04.2015. The date of P7 is 22.06.2014. If

the 1st Respondent complied with her own endorsement made on P7, she would

have admitted the Petitioners child in January 2015 itself. But she did not do

so. For the above reasons we hold that the 1st Respondent has violated the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

For the above reasons, we direct the 1st Respondent to admit the Petitioners

child to Grade VI in Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo in the year 2019. The 1st

Respondent is directed to comply with this direction within one month from the

date of this judgment.
