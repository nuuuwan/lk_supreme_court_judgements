The Provincial Director of Health Services has stated in his affidavit that a letter dated 08th October 2012 marked \u201c2R3\u2019 had been sent by his predecessor to the petitioner advising that the petitioner or his defence officer could examine the documents and take copies on 15th October 2012. I see no reason to disbelieve this categorical statement affirmed to by the Provincial Director of Health Services that the letter marked \u201c2R3\u201d was sent to the petitioner. However, in his counter affidavit, the petitioner denies having received \u201c2R3\u201d and states \u201cno such letter was received by me\u201d. That denial has a ring of truth since it is seen that \u201c2R3\u201d was sent to the petitioner\u2019s home address and, by that time, the petitioner was in remand custody, as narrated later on. But, it should be mentioned that the petitioner\u2019s defence officer had sent the letters dated 05th September 2012, 16th September 2012, 26th October 2013, 06th December 2013 and 13th January 2014 marked \u201cP21\u201d to \u201cP25\u201d asking that an opportunity be given to examine the documents and take copies. The Provincial Director of Health Services has admitted receiving several of these letters. In those circumstances, he should have replied the letters sent by the defence officer and informed him that the letter marked \u201c2R3\u201d had been sent giving an opportunity to examine the documents and take copies. The Provincial Director of Health Services should have also fixed another day on which the defence officer could examine the documents and take copies. In any event, as mentioned later on, the petitioner was given another opportunity to examine the documents and take copies on 28th May 2015.",

In this regard, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the officers of the Department of Provincial Internal Audit and Investigation have not obtained the statements of relevant persons or verified the facts by questioning the medical officers who signed the \u201cGovernment Order (Diesel)\u201d Forms. It has also been submitted that \u201cP57\u201d does not include details of readings from the odometer of the ambulance. However, a perusal of \u201cP57\u201d shows that a statement from the petitioner was obtained before \u201cP57\u201d was prepared. In fact, the petitioner has admitted making a statement to an officer of the Department of Provincial Internal Audit and Investigation. \u201cP57\u201d records that the officers of the Department of Provincial Internal Audit and Investigation examined the individual \u201cGovernment Order (Diesel)\u201d Forms. These documents bear the signatures of the medical officers who authorised the purchase of diesel and the identity of these medical officers is ex facie evident on the documents. The fact that the petitioner prepared these \u201cGovernment Order (Diesel)\u201d Forms and that he has signed them, is also ex facie evident on the documents. \u201cP57\u201d makes it clear that \u201cDaily Running Sheets\u201d of the ambulance were examined and, in the normal course of business, these documents would have contained readings from the odometer of the ambulance. To sum up, a reading of \u201cP57\u201d leads me to take the view that it sets out a comprehensive report of the alleged fraud said to have been committed by the petitioner. \u201cP57\u201d contains a considerable amount of detail and refers to a large volume of documents which were examined prior to issuing the report. In this connection, it has to be also kept in mind that section 13:1 is only a broad description of what would constitute a `preliminary investigation\u2019 as envisaged in the Establishments Code. Section 13:1 is only a guide. It is not a rigid list of mandatory instructions which will vitiate a `preliminary investigation\u2019 simply because one or even a few of the steps referred to in section 13:1 have not been taken. What is important and what is stressed in section 13:1 is that the `preliminary investigation\u2019 should encompass an investigation of the facts relating to a complaint or a suspicion that a public officer has committed an act of misconduct and that this investigation should be sufficient to ascertain and report on whether or not there is sufficient material and evidence to establish a prima facie case which justifies issuing a Charge Sheet and proceeding to",

However, this Court is not in a position to act on these hypotheses when considering the present application. It would be inappropriate for us to place ourselves in the position of the Internal Audit Officers who carried out the investigation. Our function in the present application is to assess whether an objective, unbiased and reasonable preliminary investigation [or its equivalent in terms of section 29 of the Code] was carried out and whether the outcome of that exercise was a finding that a prima facie case of misconduct had been established against the petitioner. As held earlier, the answer to that question is in the affirmative. For the reasons set out earlier, the petitioner\u2019s first contention fails. It is necessary to now consider the petitioner\u2019s second contention that the respondents have failed to comply with the provisions of the Establishments Code with regard to procedural steps prior to the commencement of the Disciplinary Inquiry.",

However, there are two exceptions to the aforesaid general rule set out in the second limb of section 22:1:1 The first exception is in the case of a public officer facing a disciplinary inquiry in respect of Charges framed in respect of one or both types of misconduct falling within the ambit of section 31:11 of the Code and is under interdiction. Section 22:1: 1 provides that such a public officer need not be reinstated in service and paid his salary even if the disciplinary inquiry continues after the lapse of one year from the issue of the Charge Sheet. The second exception is in the case of a public officer who is under interdiction pending the conclusion of a disciplinary inquiry against him and whose own acts or omissions cause the disciplinary inquiry to spill over the specified period of one year. Section 22:1:1 provides that in such cases, the public officer need not be reinstated in service and paid his salary even if the disciplinary inquiry continues after the lapse of one year from the issue of the Charge Sheet. Accordingly, in the present case, the first limb of section 22:1:1 of the Code placed a duty on the Disciplinary Authority [ie: the Provincial Director of Health Services] to conclude the disciplinary inquiry and issue a disciplinary order within a period of one year from the issue of the Charge Sheet dated 20th June 2012 marked \u201cP15(b)\u201d - ie: on or before 20th June 2013.",

As mentioned earlier, the Disciplinary Authority had sent the letter dated 08th October 2013 marked \u201c2R3\u201d to the petitioner advising him that he could examine the documents and take copies on 15th October 2012 but the petitioner states he did not receive \u201c2R3\u201d. The truth of the petitioner\u2019s claim is supported by the fact that the petitioner was in remand custody when \u201c2R3\u201d was sent to his home address. In these circumstances, as mentioned earlier, the Provincial Director of Health Services should have replied the letters marked \u201cP21\u201d to \u201cP25\u201d sent by the petitioner\u2019s defence officer and fixed another day on which the defence officer could examine the documents and take copies.

Fernando J held [at p.85-86] \u201cThe Petitioner's complaint is not that he was directly deprived of those safeguards: but only of the delay in the proceedings. It is trite, but nevertheless true, that justice delayed is justice denied: for the very good reason that delay may result in the denial of the substance of a fair trial, although all the forms are solemnly observed. Delay may result in essential witnesses and documents becoming unavailable, in recollections slowly fading, in legal expenses gradually becoming ever more unbearable, and in sapping the will to fight on for justice. All the safeguards may be there as a matter of form, but the substance of the protection of the law will be lacking. The aim of the protection of the law is to ensure justice, and so when there is inordinate delay, it can equally truly be said: protection delayed is protection denied. All delay is unacceptable, but that is not enough. What amount of delay is to be regarded as inordinate ?\u201d",

The fact that the Charges against the petitioner were of misconduct involving dishonesty falling within the ambit of section 31:11 of the Code does, where necessary and particularly where the collation and production of comprehensive evidence at the disciplinary inquiry is time consuming, give a Disciplinary Authority a reasonable period time beyond the usual twelve months to conclude disciplinary proceedings.
