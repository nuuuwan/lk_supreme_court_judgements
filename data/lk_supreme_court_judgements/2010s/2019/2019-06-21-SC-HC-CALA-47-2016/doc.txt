action against the 1st and 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Respondents’) seeking damages for pain of mind,

loss of reputation and harassment caused by malicious prosecution, before the

District Court. The case was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge by

his judgment dated 25th January 2010.

Being aggrieved by the said decision the Plaintiff filed an appeal in the High Court

of Civil Appeal. The said appeal to the High Court was also dismissed. Thereafter,

seeking to set aside the said judgement, the Plaintiff filed the present Leave to

Appeal Application in the Supreme Court.

On 02nd March 2016, while the said Application was pending before this Court,

the Plaintiff passed away. The heirs of the Plaintiff, the Petitioners abovenamed,

filed a Petition seeking permission to substitute themselves in room and place of

the Plaintiff, in order to prosecute the Leave to Appeal Application. The learned

President’s Counsel for the 2nd Respondent objected to the substitution and raised

a preliminary objection on the basis that the cause of action, being an action based

on personal nature, cannot survive after the death of the Plaintiff.

Counsel representing all parties agreed that the order on the preliminary

objections could be decided on the written submissions filed by the respective

parties.

Positions taken by the respective parties:

It is common ground that no judgment in favour of the Plaintiff has been entered

at any point and it has not been disputed that the Petitioners are the lawful heirs

of the deceased Plaintiff.

It is the position of the 2nd Respondent that, the Petitioners would have been

bestowed with the right to be substituted in place of the deceased Plaintiff as his

legal representatives, only had there been a judgement in favour of the Plaintiff at

the time of his death, since the action of the Plaintiff is an action in personam i.e.

a personal action.

6

On the other hand, the Counsel for the Petitioners has submitted that the action-

even though of a personal nature-survives as the stage of litis contestatio has been

reached. In support of this contention, the decision in Malalage v Weerakoon,

Inspector of Police, Anuradhapura Police Station (SC FR Application No.

278/2008) which followed the precedent set in Atapattu v People’s Bank (1997 1

SLR 208, 218, 219) has been cited. In Atapattu v People’s Bank it has been held

that the rule against substitution in personal actions is subject to the qualification

that there has not been litis contestatio before the death. In the said judgment

Fernando J. cited ‘Law of Delict’ by McKerron where it is stated that “for the effect

of litis contestatio, which in modern law is deemed to take place at the moment the

pleadings are closed, is to freeze the Plaintiff’s rights as at that moment, and thus,

in the event of his dying before the action is heard, to confer upon his executor all

the rights which he himself would have had if he had lived. ” (Mc Kerron, law of

Delict, 6th Edition pg.132)

It has also been pointed out on behalf of the Petitioners that, the stage at which litis

contestatio is achieved is at the closure of pleadings rather than at the time of

entering a judgment. The decision in Muheeth v Nadarajapillai (19 NLR 461 at

462) lucidly draws the distinction; the point at which litis contestatio is reached in

action in rem vis a vis action in personam. The court held;

“An action became litigious, if it was in rem, as soon as the summons

containing the cause of action was served on the defendants, if it was in

personam, on litis contestatio, which appears to synchronize with the

joinder of issue or the close of the pleadings”

The above rational was also followed in the Malalage judgment (supra).

On the strength of this position, the Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the

absence of a judgment in favor of the deceased is immaterial for the question of

‘substitution’ as the pleadings have already been concluded at the trial stage in the

District Court. The case having reached litis contestatio, there is no ambiguity with

7

regard to the parties’ respective rights and therefore there is no bar against the

Petitioners from claiming those rights.

The 2nd Respondent, however, contests this position relying on the decision of

Stella Perera and Others v Margaret Silva (2002 1 Sri LR 169). In the said case the

Plaintiff who had been gifted the property in suit by her husband, gifted the same

to two of her nephews. Then she sought to evict her husband, (the 1st Defendant)

and her adopted daughter and the daughter’s husband, (the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

respectively), from the said premises by an action filed in the District Court. The

1st Defendant in turn sought the revocation of his gift of the property to the Plaintiff

on the ground of ingratitude and a declaration that the gift made to the nephews

were null and void. The learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiff’s action and

allowed the revocation of the deed of gift by the 1st Defendant to the Plaintiff. The

Court of Appeal however, set aside the orders of the District Judge. While the case

was before the Court of Appeal, the 1st Defendant passed away. Their Lordships of

the Supreme Court held that, “However, by that time he had a judgment in his

favour in respect of his claim to have the donation to his wife revoked and for

possession. The stage of litis contestatio having been reached, the first defendant's

action did not die with him.” and that the maxim actio personalis moritur cum

persona or ‘personal right of action dies with the person’ was not applicable to the

case and that the action was not extinguished by the death of the 1st Defendant for

the reason that the stage of litis contestatio had been reached. However, in the

particular case ‘litis contestatio’ was taken to be the point at which the Judgment

was given in favor of the 1st Defendant at the time of his death.

Consequently, the 2nd Respondent has argued that as “very many actions in

personam like defamation, medical negligence (subject to certain limitations),

slander, libel… would be determined by death” (Ariyaratne v Ariyaratne in SC

Appeal No. 28/2013), the Plaintiff’s action too would not survive beyond his death

8

given that an action for malicious prosecution is an action in personam and that

in the present case it has not reached the point of litis contestatio.

The survival of an Action for Malicious Prosecution

In terms of Section 392 of the Code of Civil Procedure, “the death of the plaintiff

or defendant shall not cause the action to abate if the right to sue on the cause of

action survives.” In order to decide whether the Petitioners can be substituted in

the room and place of the Plaintiff it has to be first determined whether or not the

action in question is extinguished by the death of the original Plaintiff. Substitution

can take place only if the action survives the death of the Plaintiff.

For this purpose, it is pertinent to advert to the law relating to the survival of an

action for malicious prosecution.

“Injuria, is used in the sense of contumelia, that is, damage to reputation, honour

and good name and the appropriate action for an injuria is actio injuriarum” (A

Modern Treatise on The Law of Delict, U. L. Abdul Majeed, p 65). It is trite law

that the action for malicious prosecution is based on actio injuriarum.

An action for malicious prosecution is a personal action or an action in personam.

A personal action can be defined as “an action in which the cause of action or

complain or injury is one affecting solely a person and the cause of action, which

is personal in nature, dies with the death of the person… the right to sue and the

liability to be sued is personal to the deceased and is not transmitted to or against

his estate after his death” (A Modern Treatise on The Law of Delict, Abdul Majeed,

p 331).

Under the Roman Dutch Law, Aquilian actions do not lapse by the death of either

party. In contrast, however, in cases of actio injuriarum the action, being personal,

9

does not survive the death of the Plaintiff or the Defendant. In the common law,

by the application of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona, a personal

action does not survive the death of the person whom it is attached to.

However, an exception is made to this rule if the action has reached the stage of

litis contestatio prior to the death. This position has been illustrated in the South

African case of Gillespie vs Toplis (1951 (1) SA 290 at 293) where inter alia the

Plaintiff, filed an action for personal satisfaction (for the hurt to his feelings and

dignity) against the Defendant, for violating a grave by removing the tombstone

over the grave with the railing around it, situated on a land. The Defendant passed

away before summons was issued and the plaintiff issued summons against the

Defendant’s estate. Since actio injuriarum encompassed actions for personal

satisfaction, it was considered non-transmissible against the estate of the

wrongdoer nor in favour of the estate of the person wronged, unless litis

contestatio had been reached. The court held that;

“the unlawful conduct alleged grounded no action in law against the

deceased P’s (the defendant) estate and that on P’s death before litis

contestatio, the claim against P had become extinguished.”

The Sri Lankan appellate courts have accepted and followed this litis contestatio

exception. (Atapattu v People’s Bank, Muheeth v Nadarajapillai as well as in

Associated Newspapers of Ceylon v Felicia Kariyakarawana 2006 2 Sri LR 361,

John Fernando and Attorney General v Satarasinghe 2002 (2) SLR 113.) It is

worthy of mention that the litis contestatio exception applies to situations of insult,

libel and slander which are focused on seeking reparation for sentimental hurt,

rather than the recovery of patrimonial losses.

The Stella Perera and Others v Margaret Silva (Supra) case which has been cited

by the 2nd Respondent to support the position that litis contestatio can be

considered to have been reached only if there is a judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff, intrinsically fortifies the view that where litis contestatio has been

10

reached, even an action of a personal nature may survive the death of the parties.

Furthermore, perusal of the said Stella Perera case reveals that their Lordships of

the Supreme Court have not stated that litis contestatio can only be reached when

there is a judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. Therefore, it is an overtly narrow

interpretation of the said judgment to assume that a personal action can survive

only if there is a previous judgment entered in favour of the Plaintiff.

In this backdrop, the submissions made by the respective parties must be

appreciated. The crux of the submission of the Petitioners was that, a personal

action in respect of which litis contestatio has taken place is not barred from being

substituted in favour of the original litigant’s representative, and that litis

contestatio takes place upon the conclusion of pleadings. The 2nd Respondent’s

argument was that the substitution is not permissible due to the lack of a judgment

in favour of the plaintiff.

The development of jurisprudence over the years has been to the effect that litis

contestatio is considered to take place at the moment when pleadings are closed.

(Milne v Shield Insurance Co. Ltd 1969 (3) SA (AD)352 at 358-359) This view

has been followed locally as well in cases such as Muheeth v Nadarajapillai (19

NLR 79) and Atapattu v People’s Bank (supra) which have been referred to in the

submissions of the Petitioners. In Banda et al. v Cader (16 NLR 79) pleadings were

deemed to conclude after filing of the defendant’s answer.

The law as it stands today and the rationale of the judgements referred to above,

clearly points to the proposition that the exceptional circumstances under which

substitution in a personal action, after the death of the Plaintiff takes place, can be

permitted at the conclusion of pleadings rather than at the delivery of a judgment.

The reason for the point of conclusion of pleadings to be considered as the point at

which litis contestatio is reached is to ensure that the positions of the respective

parties have been set out by them at this point and there can be no further

amendments. The practical considerations behind the point of litis contestatio

11

being the conclusion of pleadings, were illustrated in the Court of Appeal’s decision

in Ariyadasa v Weerasinghe, (Western) Provincial Housing Commissioner by His

Lordship Justice U. De Z. Gunawardena as follows;

“It is evident that the very ratio leges or the rationale of the rule that rights

of parties are frozen or fixed, at the latest, as at the point of time of litis

contestatio, is to prevent the parties from shifting or moving from one

position to another.”

Therefore, if the rationale behind this rule is to be maintained, the conclusion of

the pleadings that should be considered in the present case for the purpose of

ascertaining whether litis contestatio has in fact been reached, would be the

pleadings that were concluded at the District Court. If I were to quote further from

Justice Gunawardena’s decision in Ariyadasa v Weerasinghe (Supra) “…the rights

of parties, in particular those of the Plaintiff, must be examined usually with

reference to the point of time at which the action was commenced, if not, at the

point of time that the stage of litis contestatio was reached which stage was marked

by the filing of the Defendant’s answer as had been held in Banda v Cader 16 NLR

79 as well.”

The Petitioners’ contention that litis contestatio regarding the present action for

malicious prosecution took place at the conclusion of the pleadings more than ten

years ago is the correct position to be upheld. As far as the proceedings before the

Supreme Court is concerned, at the time of the Plaintiff’s death, apart from the

issuing of notices to the Respondents, no further pleadings had taken place in the

present Leave to Appeal Application. Therefore, the pleadings that have to be

considered for the present purposes, are those that took place at the District Court.

There is no repugnance in such construction as it is common ground that an

Appeal is not an independent action severed from the original action. As clearly set

out by Chief Justice Sharvananda in Sudharman De Silva v Attorney General

(1986) 1 Sri LR 9, at Page 13 “An appeal is not a fresh suit but is only a

12

continuation of the original proceedings and a stage in that suit itself.”

Accordingly, the pleadings that are relevant are the original proceedings that took

place at the District Court.

As the exceptional circumstance of litis contestatio has been reached by the

conclusion of the pleadings at the District Court, there is no impediment to the

survival of the action. Therefore, the right to sue on the cause of action survives,

and as such I hold that the substitution of the deceased Plaintiff Appellant-

Petitioner is permissible.

The preliminary objection is overruled.
