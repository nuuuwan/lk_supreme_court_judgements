Thus, the appeal before us, revolves around Sections 10 and 33 of the Land Acquisition Act pertaining to determination of claims for compensation in respect of land acquired by the State. The factual matrix of this Appeal is as follows: - The land in question was acquired by the State for the construction of the Southern Expressway. By Gazette notification dated 05.05.2003, Section 7 notice was published under the Land Acquisition Act calling for claims pertaing to the acquired land. On 08.07.2003 an inquiry under Section 9 was held by the Divisional Secretary. The decision under Section 10(1)(a) of the Act was made and communicated to the claimants, the appellant LRC and Agalawatte Plantations Ltd, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (\u201cAgalawatte Plantations\u201d). In the said Section 10(1)(a) Order, LRC was declared the claimant for the land and Agalawatte Plantations, for the cultivation and improvements.",
