Decided on: 28.05.2019. E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J. The Petitioners by their Petition dated 22.01.2018 have complained to this Court that

their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12 and 12(1) of the constitution were

infringed by the Respondents when the 1st Respondent refused to admit the 1st

Petitioner’s son (1a Petitioner) to Dharmaraja College Kandy by the letter dated

15.12.2017. The reason given for this refusal appears to be that the petitioners had failed

to obtain required minimum marks under the applied category. The Petitioners state that

the appeal board also later confirmed the said refusal. This court by its order dated

14.05.2018 granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the constitution.

The 1st Petitioner who is the mother of the 1a Petitioner tendered an application to

Dharmaraja College Kandy to get 1a Petitioner admitted to Grade 1. The said

application was made under the category “Children of residents living in close

proximity to the school”. The Petitioners’ stance is that they had submitted ample

documentary evidence to show that the 1st Petitioner was an eligible resident who could

get her child, 1a Petitioner admitted to Dharmaraja College Kandy.

Though the Petitioners, in their Petition, have referred to the circular No. 17/2016 as

the relevant circular, the Respondents have correctly pointed out that the relevant

circular is No. 22/2017. The Petitioners have admitted in their written submissions that

they erroneously assumed that the admissions to schools in 2018 were based on circular

No. 17/2016 (P 22) but the marking scheme for grade 1 was based on circular

No.22/2017 marked as IR2.

4

As per the said circular marked as IR2, the Petitioners’ application for the admission to

grade 1 in 2018 is governed by clause 7.2 of the said circular. Under this clause marks

are designed to be awarded under four different headings as detailed by its clauses 7.2.1

to 7.2.3., namely;

1. Proving the place of residence by evidencing the registration in the electoral

register—Maximum 30 marks (Clauses 7.2.1 to 7.2.1.3).

2. Documents in proof of residency—Maximum 15 marks (Clauses 7.2.2 &

7.2.2.1).

3. Additional documents to confirm the place of residence—Maximum 5 marks

(Clause 7.2.2.2).

4. Proximity to the school from the place of residence—Maximum 50 marks

(Clause 7.2.3).

Clauses 7.2.1 to 7.2.1.3 – Proving the place of residence by evidencing the registration

in the electoral register

Maximum of 30 marks is given under the provisions of clauses 7.2.1 to 7.2.1.3 for the

proof of residence within the feeder area when it is proved by the registration in the

electoral register. The Petitioners have tendered the applicable registration indicating

that both the parents were registered in the electoral register for the relevant area for

five years and they have obtained the maximum 30 marks allocated for proof of

residence through the registration in the electoral register. Thus, there is no allegation

about the marks given under the provisions of clauses 7.2.1 to 7.2.1.3.

Clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.2.1—Documents in Proof of Residency

The clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.2.1 provide how marks should be given for the documents or

deeds that prove the title or entitlement of the relevant person to the place of residence.

5

A careful perusal of the said clauses shows that the relevant person referred to in the

clause 7.2.2 has to be one of the following persons;

• The applicant - (As per clause 5.1, an application can be tendered by the parents

or legal guardian of the child. In other words, the applicant has to be one of the

parents or legal guardian).

• The spouse of the applicant.

• The father or mother of the applicant.

• The father or mother of the applicant’s spouse.

The clause 7.2.2 allocates marks for the documentary proof of title or entitlement to the

place of residence in the following manner;

▪ If the document in proof of residency shows the title or entitlement of the relevant

person to the place of residence for five years or more as at the final date given

to tender applications – Full marks (100%).

▪ If it is less than five years and more than three years—75% of the full marks.

▪ If it is less than three years and more than one year – 50% of the full marks.

▪ If it is less than one year and more than six months – 25% of the full marks.

▪ If it is less than six months and more than 3months – 10% of the full marks.

▪ If it is less than three months -- 05% of the full marks.

As per the said clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.2.1, the maximum one can gain under this

heading ‘Documents in proof of residency’ is 15 marks. However, when one

reads clause 7.2.2 with clause 7.2.2.1 (i), (ii) and (iii), it is clear that;

a. If the ownership or entitlement to the place of residence is in the name

of the applicant/spouse, the applicant can gain the maximum of 15 marks

subject to the percentages referred to above in relation to the period of

ownership.

6

b. If the ownership or entitlement is in the name of the mother/father of the

applicant/spouse, the applicant can gain only 10 marks out of the

maximum of 15 marks, which is further subject to the percentages

referred to above in relation to the period of ownership.

c. If the applicant's residency is based on a registered leasehold right or as

an occupant of a government quarters or as a tenant under the Rent Act,

the applicant can gain only 6 marks out of the maximum 15 marks subject

to the percentages referred to above in relation to his entitlement to the

resident property.

However, the 1st Petitioner alleges that she was given only 11.25 marks out of 15 marks

under the clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.2.2 for the proof of title to the place of residence though

she produced her title deeds marked as P5 (wrongly referred to as P4 in the petition)

and P6 when she should have been given the maximum of 15 marks. P5 shows

ownership in the name of the Petitioner only for 3 years and few months which is less

than five years. As per clause 7.2.2, she is entitled only to 75% of the maximum 15

marks for this deed. However, the Petitioner’s contention is that since the previous deed

in the chain of title marked as P6 is in the name of her father she should have been given

the maximum 15 marks. This contention of the Petitioner cannot be accepted since

clause 7.2.2 gives marks to the document in proof of residency which is in the name of

the relevant person. It contemplates only one relevant person not many. In the instant

case, it is the Petitioner not her predecessors in title.

Furthermore, to give marks time is counted from the date the ownership or entitlement

was transferred to the name of the relevant person to the final date given to tender

applications. Since the time is counted until the final date given for applications, it

impliedly indicates that the relevant person aforementioned is the person who holds the

7

relevant document in his/her name as at the final date given to tender applications. The

father of the 1st Petitioner, the predecessor in title, did not hold the ownership in his

name at the final date given to tender applications, since he gifted his right to the

Petitioner by executing deed marked as P5. Therefore, I cannot accept the stance taken

up by the 1st petitioner that she should have been given maximum 15 marks for the

documents in proof of residency, which has to be in the name of the relevant person.

On the other hand, there is no allegation that for any of the applicants, marks were given

for his/her or his/her spouse’s title documents as well as for the title documents of the

father/mother of the applicant or his spouse causing discrimination.

Clause 7.2.2.2—Additional documents to confirm the place of residence

Maximum of 5 marks, i.e. at the rate of 1 mark for each document up to 5 documents,

is given for the additional documents tendered to confirm the place of residence under

the above clause. The Petitioner has been given the maximum marks under this heading.

Thus, there is no allegation about the marks given under this heading.

Clause 7.2.3 - Proximity to the school from the place of residence

Maximum of 50 marks is given under this heading only if the applicant’s place of

residence is proved, and if there are no other Government Schools with primary sections

located closer to the place of residence than the school applied for. In the event of

having other Government schools with primary sections for the admission of the child

which are closer to the place of residence than the school applied for, marks are

deducted at the rate of 5 marks from the maximum marks for each such closer school.

As per the parenthesis of this clause, to reduce marks, other government primary

school/schools which are closer to the place of residence must;

• have the learning medium the child has applied for,

8

• be a girls’ or boys’ school or a mixed school appropriate for the child and

• be able to admit 10% or more children of the religion to which the child belongs

to.

The 1st Petitioner alleges that she should have been given 40 marks out of maximum 50

marks under this heading but was given only 30 marks. Her position is that marks

should not have been deducted for D.S. Senanayake Vidyalaya, since it is not closer to

the petitioner's residence when compared with the distance to Dharmaraja College. She

further has taken up the position that the respondents have not been able to maintain a

consistent policy, since in 2017 1st Respondent informed the Human Rights

Commission that the interview board of that time had reached a common decision not

to deduct marks for Sirimalwatte Vidyalaya on different reasons even when it was

closer to the applicants who had applied for Dharmaraja Vidyalaya. She further states

that the said Sirimalwatte Vidyalaya is situated in Kundasale Pradeshiya saba limits

while the applicant resides and Dharmaraja college is situated at Kandy Municipal

limits.

However, it appears that by the application marked as P1 with the petition, though the

petitioners have claimed the maximum 50 marks, the 1st Petitioner herself has identified

four schools as schools that are situated in closer proximity to the 1st Petitioner’s

residence which allows deducting 5 marks each totalling up to 20 marks out of 50 marks

as per the marking scheme. Those four schools are Dharmashoka Vidyalaya, D.S.

Senanayake Vidyalaya, Sangamitta Vidyalaya and Sirimalawatte Vidyalaya. Thus, on

the face of the application, the respondents are entitled to reduce 20 marks out of the 50

marks given under this grouping. Anyhow, the petitioner now argues that the deduction

of 10 marks for D.S. Senanayake College and Sirimalwatta Maha Vidyalaya was made

in an arbitrary manner. In support of the petitioners’ present argument that Dharmaraja

9

College is situated closer to her residence than D.S. Senanayake College, the 1st

Petitioner has marked two letters issued by the Head of Land Division, Kandy

Municipal Council marked as P17 and P18. P17 states that the aerial distance between

1st Petitioner’s residence and Dharmaraja College is 1.25 Km., and as per the said letter

P18, the distance between 1st Petitioner’s residence and D.S. Senanayake Vidyalaya is

1.28 Km. The Petitioners complain that irrespective of such evidence five marks were

deducted for the closer proximity of D.S Senanayake College. If members of the

interview board have to rely on survey reports tendered by each applicant, the allocation

of marks would be affected by and subject to the reliability, skills and experience of

each surveyor giving others an opportunity to question the propriety of such reports. It

is always prudent to use a common map or method to measure the distance between

places of residence and the relevant schools. The clause 7.6.1 of the relevant circular

provide proper guidance in this regard. As per the said clause, when considering

proximity from the place of residence, the aerial distance shall be taken, and the map

prepared by the Department of Surveyor General shall be used for this purpose.

Furthermore, the circle with the radius from the main door of the applicant’s house to

the main office of the school or the primary office if the primary office is on a separate

place from the main school shall be drawn and if there are schools where child could

be enrolled within the said circle, marks shall be deducted. However, even if any such

school is located within the said circle, if it is difficult to access the said school due to

natural barriers such as rivers, lagoons, marshlands, forests etc. marks shall not be

deducted for such schools. The 1st petitioner does not complain that the relevant

authorities did not use the aerial map prepared by the Department of Surveyor General

or the calculation of distance is wrong according to such map prepared by the Surveyor

General’s Department. In her petition, she states that she was not informed how the

marks were allocated or deducted indicating that she was not aware of how it was done,

10

but in contrast she avers that the methods adopted by the interview board to measure

the distance between one's residence and the particular school were not based on a

scientific and/or rationale method.-vide Paragraphs 30 and 32 of the Petition. However,

the 1st Respondent has stated in his affidavit that in measuring the distance he adhered

to the criteria stipulated in the relevant circular 22/2017.

The Petitioners do not allege that the schools which are in closer proximity cannot

admit 10% or more children of the same religion to which the 1a Petitioner belong.

Neither is there any allegation that natural barriers are making access to such schools

difficult. The 1st Respondent asserts that the aerial distance was measured as per the

criteria stipulated by the aforesaid clause 7.2.3. In fact, the aerial map was submitted to

the court during the oral argument without objections, which clearly shows that the

straight distance to D.S Senanayake Vidyalaya is less than the distance to Dharmaraja

College. All other schools including Sirimalwatta Vidyalaya mentioned in the

application marked as P1 are closer to the resident of the 1st Petitioner as per the said

aerial map.

As far as Sirimalwatta Vidyalaya is concerned, it may be true that it is situated within

the Kundasale Pradeshiya Saba area. As per clause 4.7, the feeder area of a school is

the administrative district in which the school is situated, and when the school is situated

on a border of an administrative district, nearest divisional secretary's division of the

neighbouring administrative district is also considered as the feeder area of the given

school. The 1st petitioner has not placed any material to indicate that the residence of

the 1st petitioner does not fall within the feeder area of Sirimalwatta Vidyalaya. In the

backdrop mentioned above, I do not see that there is any valid reason as per the relevant

circular presented before this court to show that reduction of marks is not in accordance

with the said circular marked as IR1.

11

As mentioned before, based on the documents marked P19 and P19a the Petitioners

state that in 2017 1st Respondent informed the Human Rights Commission that the

interview board had reached a common decision not to deduct five marks for

Sirimalawatte Vidyalaya and admitted a student under application No. 182 to the school

without deducting marks for Senanayake Vidyalaya and Sirimalwatte Vidyalaya.

Petitioner submits that a cardinal principle in equal protection is that it does not mean

all persons and things that are subject to classification should be treated alike. It means

that persons or things similarly circumstanced must be similarly treated. In that sense,

the Petitioners argue that it is difficult to categorise Dharmaraja College in Kandy

Municipality and Sirimalwatte Vidyalaya in Kundasale Division as equally

circumstanced schools in relation to socio-economic and geographical reasons.

Petitioner states this is the reason why in the previous year education authorities have

taken a common decision not to deduct five marks for Sirimalwatte Vidyalaya. The

present application is not based on alleged discrimination or inequality before the law

between Dharmaraja College or Sirimalwatta Vidyalaya but with regard to the rights of

the Petitioners. In relation to the matters complained in the petition, the similarly

circumstanced persons in comparison to the Petitioners have to be identified among the

applicants for the year 2018 but not from the applicants for the previous year 2017.The

number of vacancies, number of applicants and the relevant circulars and guidelines

would have been different in the previous year. As such, methods used in selecting

students in the previous year cannot be considered in deciding whether any

discrimination or inequality before the law took place in selecting students for the year

2018.

The 1st Petitioner also states that the 1st respondent in an arbitrary manner made the 5th

and 6th respondents to get more marks than the petitioner even when they do not reside

12

closer to Dharmaraja College compared to 1st Petitioner’s residency causing

discrimination-vide paragraph 34 and 35 of the Petition. In reply to this allegation, the

1st Respondent has explained that the 5th and 6th Respondents got more marks since there

were no schools within the circle drawn in favour of the 5th Respondent and only one

school within the circle drawn for the 6th Respondent. 5R1 tendered by the 5th

respondent shows that he got 91 marks including the maximum 50 marks for the

proximity of his residence to the school. Other than mere statements of the 1st Petitioner

no material is placed before this court to show that the marks given to the 5th and 6th

Respondents were not in accordance with the relevant circular.

It is clear that the total of 76.25 marks given to the petitioners was in compliance with

the relevant circular and it was insufficient since the threshold was 85marks.

The Petitioners have submitted that the 1st Petitioner has based her case on the particular

executive action that had been engaged with an unreasonable classification but not on

an error on admission scheme itself-vide paragraph 20 of the written submission. Thus,

the Petitioners’ action is to challenge the decision of the 1st Respondent and/or interview

board and/or appeal board alleging that they wrongly construed and applied the relevant

circular in giving marks in relation to the admission of 1a petitioner to Dharmaraja

College Kandy. What the petitioners allege is that the 1st Respondent failed in adopting

proper principles to administer stipulated classification provided by the circular-vide

paragraph 16 and 17 of the written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioners. The

Petitioners further have cited Budhan Choudhry Vs State of Bihar AIR 1995 SC 191,

Palihawadana Vs Attorney General 1978 (1) SLR 65, Ram Krishna Dalmia Vs

Justice Tendolkar AIR 1958 SC 538, Tuan Ishan Ruban et al Vs T.I.de Silva

(acting IGP) case No.SC/FR/599/2003 and bring to the attention of this court that to

pass the test of permissible classification following two conditions have to be satisfied.

13

• The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which

distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left

out of the group, and

• The differentia must have a reasonable or a rationale relation to the object

and effects sought to be achieved.

The counsel for the petitioner argues that a classification to come within the framework

of Article 12(1) of the constitution there must, therefore, be some rational nexus

between the basis of classification and the objects to be achieved by such classification.

However, as elucidated before in this judgment the Petitioners failed in establishing that

the Respondents wrongly applied the relevant circular and its clauses in the selection

process and had been engaged with an unreasonable classification. The respondents, on

the other hand, have explained that they have correctly followed the classifications and

the marking scheme contained in the relevant circular. The Petitioners’ case, as

mentioned before, is not filed to challenge the classifications contained in the circular

or its marking scheme. In fact, he failed to refer to the relevant circular and based his

petition on the circular that was relevant to the admissions to grade 1 in the previous

year. In that backdrop, I do not see any reason to apply the ratio decidendi of aforesaid

cases in favour of the petitioners.

The Respondents have raised two preliminary objections as,

1. Members of the interview board or the appeal board have not been made parties

to this application, and,

2. Petitioners have not appended the applicable circular No. 22/2017.

14

The Petitioners state that such omissions were due to lack of proper information.

Whatever the reason for such omissions, even the merits of the case as elucidated above

do not support the application of the Petitioners. Thus, the application of the Petitioners

is dismissed without costs.
