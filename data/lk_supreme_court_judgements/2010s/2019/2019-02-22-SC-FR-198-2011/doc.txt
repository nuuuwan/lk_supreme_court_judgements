BEFORE: Buwaneka Aluwihare, PC, J. Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J. & H.N.J Perera, J. COUNSEL: Shyamal A. Collure with Rassim Hameed for Petitioner. Anura Meddegoda with Nadeesha Kannangara for the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Madhawa Thennakoon, SSC for the 3rd and 4th Respondents. ARGUED ON: 21.03.2017 DECIDED ON: 22.02.2019 Aluwihare PC. J., This is an application under Article 126 of the Constitution and the court

granted leave to proceed for the alleged violations of Articles 11, 12 (1),

13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Constitution against the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The facts that gave rise to the violations alleged, are as follows:

According to the Petitioner, on the 24th April, 2011 four persons in

civvies had come to the meat stall he runs at the Willaththewa Sunday

fair. Handcuffed and blindfolded, the petitioner had been taken away in

a vehicle by the four persons. The Petitioner was taken to a thicket and

had been subjected to assault intermittently. Sometime later in the day,

he had been brought to a building and the blindfold had been removed.

At that point the Petitioner had realized that he was at a police station.

1st and 2nd respondents as well as the other three persons who

accompanied the 1st Respondent to his meat stall had been present.

The Petitioner alleges that he was assaulted by the 1st Respondent with a

club that resembled a walking stick. The Petitioner further alleges that

3

the blows alighted on his shoulders and the head. In addition, the

Petitioner alleges that the 1st Respondent took him to the Crimes Branch

of the Police Station and was assaulted again with the club.

Around 8.00 in the evening, again, the Petitioner had been taken in a

vehicle, handcuffed and blindfolded, and they had demanded him to

hand over the ‘items that he had stolen’. This routine had been repeated

on the following day i.e. 25th April, 2011. The Petitioner alleges that he

was subjected to assault during these journeys, in spite of his denial of

any involvement in the alleged incidents of burglary. According to the

Petitioner, he had been forced to spend the nights of both 24th and 25th

April at two houses, he gathered, which had been burgled. On the 26th

morning while travelling in the vehicle the 1st Respondent had received

a telephone call from the 2nd Respondent who had told the 1st Respondent

not to assault innocent people and bring the Petitioner back to the police

station. The Petitioner claims that as instructed by the 2nd Respondent,

he was brought back to the police station and put in the police cell.

According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent had intermittently taken

the Petitioner out of the cell and had subjected him to assault.

On 27th April, the 1st Respondent had recorded his statement and, on 28th

April, he had been produced before a Medical Officer at the Madampe

District Hospital. As he had been threatened by the 1st Respondent who

accompanied him, not to divulge the fact that he was assaulted, he had

kept silent when he was questioned by the doctor. After having the

Petitioner brought back from the hospital, he had been released on police

bail on the same day (i.e. 28th April) that was four days after his arrest.

According to the Petitioner, he had not been produced before a magistrate

from the point of his arrest up to the release.

4

The Petitioner further alleges that the 1st Respondent handed over to him

a piece of paper on which the telephone number of the 1st Respondent

was written and demanded that he be paid Rs.50, 000/-if charges are

not to be pressed against him. A copy of the said document is marked

and produced as P3 which carries the numbers 0779864774 and the

writing in Sinhala the name “Ananda”. It appears that the number and

the letters were scribbled on a piece of paper torn from a prescribed form

used by the Police Department, in their official work.

On the very day he was released, he had gone to the Police Head Quarters

and had lodged a complaint and the acknowledgement issued by the

Police Headquarters is pleaded in these proceedings as P4.

On the following day (i.e. 29th April) the Petitioner had also complained

to the Inspector General of Police (the 3rd Respondent) who had directed

the Superintendent of Police Chilaw, to conduct an inquiry into the

complaint lodged.

On 29th of April, the Petitioner had got himself admitted to the Chilaw

General Hospital and on 1st May had been examined by the Judicial

Medical Officer. The fact remains that the Petitioner had neither been

produced before a court in relation to any offence alleged to have been

committed by him, nor had he been charged in relation to any criminal

offence.

On a direction given by this court, the Director of the General Hospital,

Chilaw had forwarded the Medico Legal Report (MLR) and other medical

records pertaining to the Petitioner.

According to the MLR, the Petitioner had given a history identical to the

narration of events he had placed before this court by his Petition. In the

5

history given, however, the Petitioner had not referred to the 2nd

Respondent as a person who assaulted him, but had said “Ananda and

another policeman hit him.”

The doctor had observed, apart from hand cuff marks, seven contusions

and one abrasion. The doctor had opined that the injuries are non-

grievous in nature and probably caused with a blunt weapon. When one

considers the seat of the injuries coupled with the medical opinion; that

the injuries have resulted due to blunt trauma, the injuries are

undoubtedly compatible with the version of the Petitioner. The Bed Head

Ticket indicates that the Petitioner had been rational at the time of

admission and no signs of any impairment of the limbs nor had there

been any chest or abdominal trauma. The doctor also had noted that the

Petitioner had no external injuries.

The 1st Respondent had admitted that he placed the Petitioner in custody

because he could not satisfactorily explain his presence at the location

where he was arrested and the contradictory answers given by him with

regard to his identity and the place of residence. Although the 1st

Respondent alleges that he arrested the Petitioner in accordance with the

procedure established by law, the 1st Respondent had failed to disclose

the alleged offence or offences for which he took the Petitioner into

custody.

Every arrest by a police officer, attracts Section 23 (1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act and it is mandatory that the person arrested

should be informed of the nature of the charge or allegation upon which

he is arrested. A bare assertion that the arrest is in accordance with the

procedure established by law, falls far short of the standard expected of

the applicable legal provision.

6

In the case of Malinda Channa Pieris 1994 1 SLR pg. 1, it was pointed

out by the Court;

“a reason for arrest, a reason to deprive a person of his personal liberty

within the meaning of Article 13 (1) of the Constitution must be ‘a

ground for arrest’. There can be no such ground other than a violation of

the law or a reasonable suspicion of the violation of the law.

Furthermore, personal liberty of a citizen of this country is guaranteed

by the Constitution and State has an obligation towards its subjects to

ensure that citizens are free to enjoy that right without any fetters,

subject, however, to exceptions laid down under the law where that

freedom can be restricted and as such, strict compliance of the law is

required if the freedom guaranteed under the Constitution is to be

curtailed; and there cannot be any derogation from the requirements laid

down in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The right to be informed of

the reasons to arrest is one of the principles of ordinary law which is

restated in the second part of Article 13 (1) of the Constitution and

provides that “Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for

his arrest”.

Former Chief Justice Sharvananda, in his treatise on Fundamental Rights

in Sri Lanka (page 141) observed as follows;

“The requirement that the person arrested should be

informed of the reason for his arrest is a salutary

requirement. It is meant to afford the earliest opportunity

to him to remove any mistake, misapprehension or

misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting authority

and to disabuse the latter’s mind of the suspicion which

triggered the arrest and also for the arrested person to

know exactly what the allegation or accusation against

7

him is so that he can consult his Attorney-at-Law and be

advised by him……. A bold statement that the arrestee is a

terrorist falls far short of the required standard.”

The 1st Respondent has taken up the position that he took the Petitioner

into custody on 27th April as opposed to the 24th, the date the Petitioner

alleges that he was arrested. In support of the Petitioner’s contention,

both Sunil Jayantha and A.S. Mohamed Rizvi who were running meat

stalls at the same Sunday fair along with the Petitioner, had sworn

affidavits (P1 and P2) to the effect that the Petitioner was arrested on the

24th April by four persons around 1.30 p.m. and that they had taken him

in a white van which did not carry a Registration plate. Both have stated

that the Petitioner was handcuffed and blindfolded.

Interestingly, the 1st Respondent takes up the position that the Petitioner

is a person prone to criminal disposition. The position of the 1st

Respondent is that he was investigating into a series of cases relating to

house breaking and theft that had taken place on the 20th and 21st of

April and he was conducting investigations in order to ascertain the

identity of the persons responsible for these crimes. In this backdrop, it is

quite probable that the 1st Respondent entertained a suspicion with

regard to the Petitioner, given the background knowledge the 1st

respondent had of the Petitioner. Even if that may have been the case, yet

the Respondent had no right to place the Petitioner in custody in the

absence of any evidence indicative of any complicity on the part of the

Petitioner in the alleged crimes. The Petitioner had pleaded in these

proceedings, that he was repeatedly abused both physically and verbally

calling upon him to hand over what he is alleged to have removed from

the houses that were burgled. On the other hand the 1st Respondent was

8

conducting investigations into a series of house burglaries. In this

backdrop, because of the 1st Respondent’s notion that the Petitioner is a

person who has a propensity towards criminality, it was very probable

that the 1st Respondent would have taken the Petitioner into custody on

the assumption that he was involved or had had some complicity in the

instances of house breakings which were being investigated. The

Petitioner’s version that he was repeatedly questioned about the articles

removed from the houses that were burgled and the fact that he was

taken to a few houses that were burgled, blends with the very

investigation the 1st Respondent was conducting at that point of time,

thus giving credence to the version of the Petitioner.

On the other hand, if the Petitioner was merely taken into custody on

suspicion and was released after questioning without being charged with

an offence, rationally would one expect such a person to take the

measures the Petitioner had followed? As referred to earlier, on the day

he was released, he lodged a complaint with the Police Headquarters, the

following day he made complaints to both the IGP the 3rd Respondent,

and followed it by a prompt complaint to the Human Rights Commission.

All these prompt measures cry the pleas of a person who had suffered at

the hands of the police.

Over the years, this Court, in innumerable judgements, had laid down

the legal requirements that a police officer is expected mandatorily to

follow, when placing a citizen in custody. However, it is regrettable to

note that even in this day, it is practiced in the breach. In this context, I

wish to cite the case of Christie v. Leachinsky 1947 AC 457 decided by

the House of Lords more than half a century ago and which is very much

relevant today.

9

In the case referred to Viscount Simon held:

“Police officers must at common law give a detained person a reason for

his arrest at or within a reasonable time of the arrest. Under ordinary

circumstances, the police should tell a person the reason for his arrest at

the time they make the arrest. If a person’s liberty is being restrained, he

is entitled to know the reason. If the police fail to inform him, the arrest

will be held to be unlawful, with the consequence that if the police are

assaulted as the suspect resists arrest, he commits no offence, and if he is

taken into custody, he will have an action for wrongful imprisonment.

In the said case, Viscount Simon summarised a police officer’s powers of

arrest at common law: ‘(1) If a policeman arrests without warrant upon

reasonable suspicion of felony, or of other crime of a sort which does not

require a warrant, he must in ordinary circumstances inform the person

arrested of the true ground of arrest. He is not entitled to keep the reason

to himself or to give a reason which is not the true reason. In other words,

a citizen is entitled to know on what charge or on suspicion of what crime

he is seized. (2) If the citizen is not so informed, but is nevertheless seized,

the policeman, apart from certain exceptions, is liable for false

imprisonment. (3) The requirement that the person arrested should be

informed of the reason why he is seized naturally does not exist if the

circumstances are such that he must know the general nature of the

alleged offence for which he is detained. (4) The requirement that he

should be so informed does not mean that technical or precise language

need be used. The matter is a matter of substance, and turns on the

elementary proposition that in this country a person is, prima facie,

entitled to his freedom and is only required to submit to restraints on his

freedom if he knows in substance the reason why it is claimed that this

10

restraint should be imposed. (5) The person arrested cannot complain

that he has not been supplied with the above information as and when

he should be, if he himself produces the situation which makes it

practically impossible to inform him, e.g., by immediate counter-attack

or by running away. There may well be other exceptions to the general

rule in addition to those I have indicated, and the above propositions are

not intended to constitute a formal or complete code, but to indicate the

general principles of our law on a very important matter.”

When the versions of the Petitioner and the 1st and 2nd Respondents

placed before this Court are considered, I am firmly of the view that the

version of the Petitioner is more probable and there is no cogent reason

to reject it. Thus, I hold that the arrest of the Petitioner, which led to his

detention are both illegal and that the Petitioner has established the

violations of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 13 (1) and

13 (2) of the Constitution.

The assertion of the Petitioner that he was assaulted with a staff is amply

substantiated by the medical records pertaining to him, pleaded in these

proceedings.

The history given by the Petitioner and the injuries sustained by him is

compatible with the version of the Petitioner. Thus, I hold that the

Petitioner was subjected by the police to physical and mental pain as

amounted in law to inhuman and degrading treatment and consequently

the Petitioner is entitled to a declaration that the State has acted in

violation of his Fundamental Right under Article 11 of the Constitution.

11

It is alleged that it was the 1st Respondent who arrested the Petitioner,

produced him at the police station for further detention and assaulted

him on numerous occasions during the period he was kept in custody.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the 1st Respondent has violated

the Petitioner’s Fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 13 (1)

and 13 (2).

As far as the 2nd Respondent is concerned, he had taken no part in the

arrest, however, the Petitioner would not have been detained at the police

station from the 24th to the 28th if the detention was not sanctioned by

the 2nd Respondent who was the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station

and he was under a duty to satisfy himself that there were sufficient

reasons to do so. In addition, the period of detention with the police

exceeds the period prescribed by law to keep a person arrested in custody;

As such I hold that the 2nd Respondent has violated the Fundamental right

of the Petitioner guaranteed under Article 13 (2) of the Constitution.

At this point I wish to consider the material in respect of the 2nd

Respondent in relation to violation of Article 11 of the Constitution.

The Petitioner in the history given to the Medico legal officer had stated

that he was assaulted by a person called “Ananda” (the 1st Respondent)

and another police officer, but had not disclosed the name or the

credentials of the ‘other officer’. According to the Petitioner, he was

arrested by four persons. On the other hand, when the Petitioner, as

alleged by him, was taken by the 1st Respondent in a vehicle, the 2nd

Respondent had instructed the 1st Respondent ‘not to assault innocent

persons and to bring the Petitioner back to the police station’ although

12

the Petitioner has pleaded in these proceedings that the 2nd Respondent

assaulted him when he was taken to his cubicle.

According to the Petitioner, he had been severely beaten even before he

was brought to the police station for about two hours with clubs and

again when he was taken out of the police station subsequently, the 1st

Respondent is alleged to have assaulted him repeatedly while travelling

in the vehicle.

The Petitioner also states that after he was brought back to the police

station and put in a cell, the 1st Respondent had taken him out and

assaulted him with fists and a club.

However, the medical evidence does not support the Petitioners version

to that extent, specifically when one considers the few non-grievous

contusions the Petitioner had sustained. This court has held that there

should be substantial material before court, to hold a violation under

Article 11 of the Constitution.

I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish a violation under

Article 11 of the Constitution as against the 2nd Respondent.

Accordingly, I grant the Petitioner the following reliefs:

(1) A declaration that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

under articles 13 (1), 13 (2) and 11 were infringed by the 1st

Respondent by the reason of unlawful arrest on 24th April 2011

his detention from the 24th to the 28th April 2011 and

degrading treatment;

(a) Compensation in a sum of Rs. 25, 000 to the Petitioner

payable by the State

(b) Compensation in a sum of Rs. 75, 000 to the Petitioner

payable by the 1st Respondent.

13

(2) A declaration that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner

under Article 13 (2) was infringed by the 2nd Respondent by

reason of unlawful detention from 24th April 2011 to the 28th

April 2011

(a) Compensation in a sum of Rs. 30, 000 to the Petitioner

payable by the 2nd Respondent.
