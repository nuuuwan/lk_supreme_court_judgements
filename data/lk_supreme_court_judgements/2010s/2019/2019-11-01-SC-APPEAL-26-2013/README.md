In addition to the above Respondent suggested the following questions of law.

Is the Defendant- Respondent-Appellant is entitled to seek possession of the

subject matter of this case without an order nullifying the permit marked as P1

Both Counsel have filed their written submissions and the matter was argued before

this bench and both Counsel have filed additional written submissions.

According to the facts of this case, Hennakatchi Gedara Kiribanda (hereinafter

referred to as the original Grantee) was given a State Grant in respect of a paddy

land bearing No. fmd$m% 1436 dated 26/01/1982 containing in extent 4A- 0R- 23P

under Section 19(6) to be read with Section 19(4) of the Land Development

Ordinance. Thereafter Original Grantee namely Hennakatchi Gedara Kiribanda passed

away intestate in 1998 without nominating a successor to the land. His wife

Meragammana Gedara Heenamma was given life interest over the said land. The

deceased Hennakatchi Gedara Kiribanda had one son and ten daughters. Grandson,

Hennakatchi Gedara Rasika Kumara Prematilaka Bandara (son of the sole son of the

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 10

deceased) claimed permit to the said land from the State. After an inquiry, upon the

death of the said Kiribanda, by letter of the Divisional Secretary of Lankapura bearing

reference No.NCP/LP/LD/.,A$722 the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent, Hennakachchi

Gedara Rasika Kumara (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) became the

permit holder/ successor to the said paddy land.

Respondent claimed that, the Appellant, H.G. Gnanawathie (a daughter of the

original grantee) at the material time to this action, without leave and licence of the

Respondent, was in forcible possession in respect of the said paddy land standing to

the North of the entire land. The Respondent filed an action at the District Court of

Polonnaruwa and asked for a declaration that,

i. the Respondent was the Grant Holder and/or owner of the land

described in the First Schedule to the Plaint,

ii. ejectment of the appellant and the persons holding under her from the

land described in the Second Schedule to the Plaint and the delivery of

undisturbed possession to the Respondent,

iii. damages in a sum of Rs. 150/- per season from June 2006.

The Respondent in his Plaint dated 16/11/2006 had averred inter alia as follows.

i. That under the Land Development Ordinance Grant bearing No. fmd$m%

1436 dated 26/01/1982 was issued in favour of the Hennakachchi

Gedara Kiribanda in respect of the paddy land containing in extent

04A-00R-23P and morefully described in the First Schedule to the

Plaint.

DivisionalSecretary of Lankapura bearing reference No. NCP/ LP/ LD/

.,A$722 the Respondent became owner of the said land.

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 10

and the Appellant in respect of the subject matter in the instant action

Appellant demanding her to quit the land in dispute.

The Appellant filed her answer dated 25/02/2008 stating inter alia as follows.

i. That the Appellant with leave and licence of her father came to the

possession of the land referred to in the Grant bearing No. fmd$m% 1436

during the life of her father and the Appellant allowed the Respondents

father to posses 2 Acres of the land.

ii. That the father had eleven children and the Respondents son was the sole

male child of her family.

iii. That the Appellant was restored to the possession of the land in dispute by

order dated 04/01/2006 in the proceedings held in Hingurakgoda Primary

Court between the Appellant and the Respondents mother.

iv. That the life interest in the Grant bearing No. fmd$m% 1436 was passed to

her mather, Meeragammana Gedara Heenamma after the death of her

father and the said Heenamma had not relinquished her life interest to the

property in suit.

v. That upon the delivery of the order in case No.16910 in favour of the

Appellant, several inquiries were held before the Divisional Secretary of

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 10

Lankapura and the Appellant objected to the change of the original title in

respect of the Grant bearing No. fmd$m% 1436'

vi. That the Divisional Secretatry of Lankapura had not complied with the

provisions of the Land Development Ordinance at the time of the issue of

document marked me 1 and hence the said document was null and void.

vii. That the Appellant had made improvements to the value of Rs. 200,000/-

to the land referred to in the Grant bearing No. fmd$m% 1436'

After the trial learned District Judge delivered the judgment on 23/07/2010 in favour

of the Appellant and dismissed the Respondents action. Learned District Judge,

among other grounds, based her decision on the following grounds.

i. That as per the evidence, all the parties were not present at the inquiry

held in order to transfer the right to the Respondent and a statement had

not been recorded from the Appellant at the said inquiry.

ii. That the document marked me 1 had no validity in law by reason that it

was not issued in compliance with the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.

iii. That the Respondent had failed to establish his title based on a valid

document issued in terms of the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.

Being aggrieved with the said judgment Respondent appealed to the Provincial High

Court of North Central Province (hereinafter referred to as the High Court).

Thereafter High Court delivered the judgment on 13/03/2012 and allowed the

appeal. Learned High Court Judges among other things based their decision on the

following grounds;

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 10

i. That the Respondent had established his title upon documents

produced and the evidence led at the trial and hence action should be

decided in favour of the Respondent

ii. That the Appellant had failed to challenge the evidence to the effect

that, Heenamma had transferred her rights to the land in dispute to the

Respondent.

iii. That the Appellant could not challenge the validity in relation to the

transfer of title to the Respondent in the District Court and the

Appellant could have challenged the validity thereof only by way of writ

in a competent court namely Court of Appeal.

Being aggrieved with the said, the Appellant had filed this appeal before this Court.

I have carefully considered the material before the District Court and the learned

Judges of the Provincial High Court, I observed that, the Divisional Secretary who

issued the said permit and his officials had given evidence before the Learned District

Judge (appear at pages 60-109 of the appeal brief). There it was stated and

evidenced that, all the relevant parties namely, the Appellant and the other

daughters were summoned for an inquiry and relevant parties did not object and

gave their consent to grant the leave and licence to the Respondent. Being

convinced with the materials before him the Divisional Secretary using his authority

had decided that the Respondent is entitled to succeed under Section 72 of the Land

Development Ordinance which is read with Rule 1 of the third Schedule of the

Ordinance as amended.

Third schedule to the Section 72 reproduced as follows;

72. If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to

succeed, or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of this

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 10

Ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder who at

the time of his or her death was paying an annual sum by virtue of the

provisions of subsection (3) of section 19At or to the holding of an owner shall,

upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without leaving behind his or

her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind his or

her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to that land or holding,

or upon the death of such spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule I of the Third

Schedule.

I. (a) The groups of relatives from which a successor may be nominated for the

purposes of section 51 shall be as set out in the subjoined table.

(b) Title to a holding for the purposes of section 72 shall devolve on one only of

the relatives of the permit holder or owner in the order of priority in which they

are respectively mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred to

the younger where there are more relatives than one in any group.

i. Sons.

ii. Daughters

iii. Grandson

iv. Granddaughters.

v. Father.

vi. Mother.

vii. Brothers.

viii. Sisters.

ix. Uncles.

x. Aunts.

xi. Nephews.

xii. Nieces.

In this rule, relative" means a relative by blood and not by marriage.

Respondent has proved before Court on balance of probability that he is the lawful

successor to the disputed land.

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 10

Under the Declaration of Title action a person is expected to submit a title if

available. There, the Respondent had submitted the letter of Grant, granted by the

Divisional Secretary of Lankapura to him.

In Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe and other (2002) SLR Vol 2, page 242 it was held that,

Issuance of a grant changes the status of a permit holder to that of a 'owner'

who derives title to the land in question. The owner - includes the permit holder

who has paid all sums which he is required to pay. The satisfaction of paying all

sums and complying with all conditions entitles that permit holder to a grant

which 'shall' be issued in terms of s. 19 (4).

In Bandaranayake vs. Karunawathie (2003) SLR Vol 3 page 295 it was held that,

Permit-holder under the Land Development Ordinance enjoys sufficient title to

enable him to maintain a vindicatory action against a trespasser.

It is settled law that in Declaration of title actions the plaintiff must prove his title. In

establishing his title the plaintiff cannot rely on the weakness of the defendants title.

In this appeal I have to consider whether the plaintiff has established his title or not

and I am of the view that, Respondent had established his title.

The Judgment of the learned District Judge questioning the validity of the succession

of the plaintiff to this land has no acceptable basis. The learned Judge of the High

Court correctly held that, the learned Judge of the District Court has erred. Hence, I

answer the first question of law negatively.

The question of law raised by the Respondent namely, whether the Defendant-

Respondent is entitled to seek possession of the subject matter of this case without

SC Appeal 26/2013 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 10

an order nullifying the permit marked as P1, will not arise on considering the above

circumstances. Hence, I find this question need not be answered.

Considering all facts and circumstances I find that, all these questions of law raised

before this Court cannot be sustained hence all are answered in the negative. I find

there is no merit in this appeal. Therefore, I dismiss the appeal with costs and I fix the

cost at Rs. 25,000/.

Appeal dismissed.
