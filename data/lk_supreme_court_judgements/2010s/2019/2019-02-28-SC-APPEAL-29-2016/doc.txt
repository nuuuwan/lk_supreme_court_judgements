Facts of the case

The plaintiff – petitioner – petitioner – appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “appellant”)

filed an action in the District Court of Homagama seeking to partition a land.

Being aggrieved by an interlocutory order made in the said case, the appellant had preferred a

revision application to the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo, established

under Article 154P of the Constitution which exercises civil appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction within the Western Province.

When the said revision application was taken up for support, a preliminary objection had been

raised on behalf of the 5A substituted – defendant – respondent in respect of the jurisdiction of

the said High Court holden in Colombo exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

on the basis that the said High Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the

aforementioned revision application, as the impugned order was delivered by the District Court

of Homagama.

Further, the 5A respondent had submitted that the said revision application should have been

filed in the High Court holden in Avissawella, exercising civil appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction, since the application was against an interlocutory order delivered by the District

Court of Homagama.

The appellant had taken up the position that in view of Section 5A (1) of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended, any High Court exercising

civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction situated within the province has appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any

District Court within such Province.

After hearing the submissions made by the parties on the said preliminary objection the said

High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo had upheld the said preliminary

objection and dismissed the said revision application. Further, the said High Court had held

that the said revision application should have been filed in the High Court holden in

Avissawella exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellants filed an application seeking leave to

appeal and accordingly, this court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law.

8

(i) Did the High Court err in holding that the High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo had no jurisdiction to revise a judgment or order of the District

Court of Homagama?

(ii) Was the High Court misdirected, and err in law by failing to properly consider and

interpret Section 5A (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 as amended by the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006 read with Article 154P (1) and Article 154P (3)

of the Constitution?

(iii) Was the High Court misdirected, and err in law in upholding the objection made by

the respondent in respect of the jurisdiction of the High Court of Colombo

established by Article 154P of the Constitution?

Did the High Court err in holding that the High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo had no jurisdiction to revise a judgment or order of the District Court of

Homagama?

According to Section 5A (1) of the said Act as amended, a High Court established in a province

under Article 154P of the Constitution is conferred with jurisdiction to exercise appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any

District Court within such province.

Section 5A (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as

amended states as follows;

“A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province, shall

have and exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments,

decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a Family Court

within such province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors

in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such District Court or Family

Court, as the case may be.” [Emphasis added]

There are nine provinces in Sri Lanka. For the purpose of administration of justice, several

High Courts exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction have been established in

each province, taking into consideration the population of each province and the number of

cases filed in those provinces. Under and in terms of the said section, the said High Courts are

9

conferred with jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals and revision applications arising from

the judgments and orders by any District Court and Family Court situated within such province.

At present, the High Courts of the Western Province exercising appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction are established in Colombo, Avissawella, Kalutara, Gampaha, Negombo,

Homagama and Mount Lavinia. There are similar arrangements in the other provinces as well.

The appellant submitted that the District Court of Homagama is situated within the Western

Province and the High Court holden in Colombo exercising civil appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction has jurisdiction to hear the revision application under reference.

This requires the consideration of the phrase “within such province” referred to in Section 5A

(1) of the said Act as amended.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition), at Page 456, the word ‘within’

is defined as follows;

“In the limits of, or in the inner part of, a space or region, especially a city or

country, in the place or realm.”

Furthermore, Collins English Dictionary and the Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines

the word ‘within’ as;

“Not beyond the limits of”, and

“Inside the range or bounds of” respectively.

Therefore, any High Court established in a Province under section 5A (1) of the said Act as

amended, has jurisdiction to hear appeals and revision applications in respect of judgments and

orders delivered by any District Court or Family Court within the boundaries of such province.

Thus, I am of the view that any such High Court situated within the Western Province has

jurisdiction to hear all appeals and revision applications arising from the judgments and orders

delivered by any District Court or Family Court situated within the Western Province.

In the circumstances, I hold that the High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo

exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction established under and in terms of section

5A (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended,

has jurisdiction to hear appeals and revision application in respect of judgments and decrees

10

delivered by the District Court of Homagama as the District Court of Homagama is situated

within the Western Province.

Accordingly, the aforementioned question of law is answered as follows;

Did the High Court err in holding that the High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo had no jurisdiction to revise a judgment or order of the District

Court of Homagama? - Yes

In view of the above conclusion, it is not necessary to consider the other questions of law in

this appeal.

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and direct the High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction to consider the said revision

application according to law and deliver a judgment.

No costs.
