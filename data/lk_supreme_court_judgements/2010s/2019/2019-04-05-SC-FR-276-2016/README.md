1st 15th Respondents on 20th February 2019.

16th-26th Respondents on 26th February 2019.

DECIDED ON : 05th April 2019.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J. The petitioners above named filed a Fundamental Rights Application and leave was

granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Thereafter 16th to 26th Respondents

intervened with the permission of the Court, those who are qualified to apply for the

post of Assistant Director in the Scientific Service in respect of the Department of

National Botanical Gardens in terms of the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR). All parties

filed written submissions and made their respective oral submissions.

Petitioners were originally joined as Graduate Development Programme and

absorbed into the Department of Agriculture as Agricultural Programme Officers.

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 13

Subsequently, they were assigned to Department of National Botanical Gardens. The

complaint of the petitioners is that, they were not absorbed in to Grade III-in the Sri

Lanka Scientific Service, as per the Scheme of Recruitment marked as P4 dated 11th

June 2015 by the petitioners.

Senior State Counsel had submitted all relevant documents regarding these

positions. She submits that, the government had taken a policy decision in

consultation with necessary State agencies to make the Department of National

Botanical Gardens efficient, and several positions were categorized under Sri Lanka

Scientific Services. Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Scientific Services was approved

and gazetted by the Secretary to the Public Service Commission on 28th August 2014

under Reference No.1877/27 (which is marked as 1R4). Accordingly, an internal

circular- 1R5 (Scheme of Recruitment- SOR) was issued by the Director General of

Department of National Botanical Gardens dated 11th June 2015 marked as 1R5.

According to the internal circular marked as 1R5, it clearly described the mode of

recruitment. As far as the Department of National Botanical Gardens is concerned,

70% of candidates will be selected under the open category and 30% of the

vacancies to be filled from the officers serving in the Department under the closed

category. It is observed that, if the officers serving in the Government Department of

National Botanical Gardens, posses relevant qualifications, they can compete either

under the open category or closed category. However other candidates who are not

currently serving in the government departments comes under the Scientific Service,

can contest under the closed category.

As was evidenced by the communication between the petitioners and other relevant

authorities, it clearly reveals that, they were aware of 1R4 (Service Minute) and 1R5

(SOR) at least by May 2016 (as per the amended petition). As per the letter dated 9th

of June 2016, sent by the Secretary to Agriculture and Science Graduates Association

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 13

of Department of National Botanical Gardens addressed to the Director General of

Department of National Botanical Gardens marked as P5 (b), they had made

representation to the Director General and complained of the allocation of 30% and

they wanted the limit to be increased from 30% to 90% for the closed category.

The complaint before this Court is regarding the Service of Recruitment (SOR).

Therefore, it can be comfortably presumed that the Petitioners were well aware of

the said SOR at least by May 2016, i.e. well before the Gazette (P6) calling for

applications for the Sri Lanka Scientific Service.

The first approval for the said SOR has been received in 2011, and followed by

consecutive approval process for the same in 2012, 2013 and 2014. All this time, the

Petitioners were employed at the Department of National Botanical Gardens.

In K.H.G. Kithsiri vs. Hon. Faizer Musthapha and Five Others (SC/FR Application

No.362/2017), it was held that,

If the facts and circumstances of an application make it clear that a petitioner,

by the standards of a reasonable man, should have become aware of the

alleged infringement by a particular date, the time limit of one month will

commence from the date on which he should have become aware of the alleged

infringement..

This Court, however in exceptional circumstances where the Petitioner was

prevented, by reason beyond his control, from taking measures which would

enable the filing of a Petition within one month of the alleged infringement and

if there had been no lapse on the part of the Petitioner, has exercised its

discretion in entertaining fundamental rights applications and had not hesitated

to apply the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia.

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 13

The Senior State Counsel who appeared for 1st-15th Respondents and the Counsel for

the 16th- 26th Respondents takes up a preliminary objection that, the fundamental

rights application of the Petitioners is time barred. Hence, the Respondents moved

this Court not to entertain this Fundamental Rights Application.

With respect to this, under Article 126 (2) of the Constitution requires any person

alleging the violation of any Fundamental Right or Language Right or of the

imminent violation of such rights by executive or administrative action, to prefer an

application to the Supreme Court within a period of one month thereof.

In Illangaratne vs. Kandy Municipal Council [1995 BALJ Vol. VI Part1page10],

Hon. Kulatunge J. explained that,

the result of the express stipulation of one month time limit in Article 126 (2) is

that, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application which is filed out

of time.

In this connection, Fernando J. commented in Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena [1988 1

SLR 384 at page 401] stated that, ... there is a heavy burden on a petitioner who

seeks that indulgence..

The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th and 11th Petitioners filed their respective complaints

before the Human Rights Commission on 7th July 2016. The petitioners relying on the

Section 13 of the Human Rights Commission Act No.31 of 1996 to overcome the

time bar of one month.

As per paragraph 13 of the Amended Petition of the Petitioners, they became aware

of the SOR in or about May 2016. As per the paragraph 14 of the Amended Petition,

Petitioners further contended that immediately thereafter, they had obtained a copy

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 13

of the said SOR. Petitioners relied upon to bridge further time gap between their

contentions of the knowledge of SOR in May 2016 and Petitioners filed their original

Petition on 16th August 2016, which is more than one month after by May 2016.

In Alagaratnam Manorajan vs. Hon. G.A. Chandrasiri, Governer, Northern

Provoince [SC Application No. 261/2013 (F/R)] decided on 11th September 2014,

Wanasundera J. held as follows,

I am of the opinion that, Section 13 of the Human Rights Commission Act

No.31 of 1996 should not be interpreted and/or used as a rule to suspend the

one months time limit contemplated by Article 126(2) of the Constitution... The

provisions of an ordinary Act of Parliament should not be allowed to be used to

circumvent the provisions in the Constitution...

Petitioners have not filed any further documents with regard to the applications to

Human Rights Commission other than the documents marked as P-7(a) to P-7(m), to

establish that the Human Rights Commission were inquired into and/or the inquiry is

pending before the Human Rights Commission to overcome the time bar of one

month.

As held by this Court, both in the Case of Subasinghe vs. The Inspector General of

Police [ SC Special 16/99 SC Minutes of 11.09.2000] and the case of Divalage

Upalika Ranaweera and others vs. Sub Inspector Vinisias and others [SC

Application 654/2003 SC Minutes 13.05.2008],

A party seeking to utilize Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act to

contend that, the period within which the inquiry into such complaint is

pending before the Commission shall not be taken into account in computing

the period of one month within which an application may be made to the

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 13

Supreme Court is obliged to place material before this Court to show that an

inquiry into his complaint is pending before the Human Rights Commission.

This application being a Fundamental Right Application, prior to considering the

objections taken by the Counsels for the Respondents, it is appropriate to consider

the merits of this application. In the present circumstances, Petitioners were recruited

under the Graduate Development Programmes and placed at the Agricultural

Department. When, the National Botanical Garden Department was created and

these Petitioners were absorbed in to the said Department with additional perks and

privileges. Subsequent to consultation with all necessary parties, the government had

decided to convert certain positions as scientific services and to attach them to Sri

Lanka Scientific Service.

We perused the available documents and find various departments were considered

for this conversion and the recruitment ratio was decided after the due process.

Under this recruitment to Scientific Services, some departments recruited 100% of

their officers from the open category and very few departments called for

applications for the recruitment of their officers from closed category. In this respect,

following examples of Departments can identified falling within the Sri Lanka

Scientific Service, offered lesser percentages for Limited Category.

As per 16R-14(a)- Export Agriculture SOR- Open 75: Limited 25.

As per 16R-14(b)- Metereology SOR- Open 75: Limited 25.

As per 16R- 14(c)- Zoological Gardens SOR- Open 75: Limited 25.

As per 16R-14 (d)- Government Analyst SOR- Open 100%.

As per 16R-14 (e)- Museums SOR- Open 100%.

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 13

In the Petitioners Department, 30% of officers were allocated under the closed

category, which is higher than the allocation given to other Departments to recruit to

their department from the closed category. Clearly, therefore the Petitioners have

been provided with an allocation of 30%, is higher than all of the above.

The Petitioners emphasized the fact that, the open category has a higher

requirement and age limit for the selection processes; thereby the Petitioners

complaint is that the Petitioners wanted to be increased to 90% from 30% of their

allocation.

Considering the required qualifications for the post advertised and the qualifications

of the candidates from open and closed category reveals that, this process bring

betterment to the public at large.

However, since this matter is dealing with a government Policy of the State, Courts

are reluctant to intervene with the said policy, unless it is seriously warranted.

In Wasantha Disanayake and others vs. Secretary, Ministry of Public

Administration (SC/FR/ 611/2012) decided on 10th September 2015, it was

observed that,

What is meant here is that equals should be treated equally and similar laws

and regulations should be applicable to persons who are similarly

circumstanced. In reference to Article 12(1) of the Constitution, it would be

necessary to show that there had been unequal treatment and therefore there

exist discriminatory action against the Petitioners.

The other institutions which were considered under this scheme have concluded their

recruitment well ahead and those departments are up and running in their work.

SC FR Application 276/2016 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 13

Unfortunately, due to the undertaking obtained by the Respondents, recruitment for

the positions in their Department is still pending which adversely affects the day-to-

day running of the said Department.

Considering the preliminary objections taken by the Respondents, we find that the

Petitioners failed to file their petition within the stipulated time period. Hence, we

hold with the Respondents and accept the preliminary objections. Accordingly, we

find that, the Petitioners are not entitled to maintain this application.

Application Dismissed with cost. Application dismissed.
