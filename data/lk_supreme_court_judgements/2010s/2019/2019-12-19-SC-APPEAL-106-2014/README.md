S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The instant Appeal was filed by the Respondent-Appellant-Appellant, Paradigm

Clothing [Private] Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Employer’/’Appellant’) against

the Judgment of the Learned Judge of the Galle High Court dated 04.06.2013, who had

affirmed the Order of the Labour Tribunal, dated 24.09.2010

I find it pertinent to produce the material facts of the case, prior to addressing

the issues before us.

The Applicants-Respondents-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

‘Employees’/’Respondents’) are residents of Niyagama and were employed as blue-

collar workers at the Niyagama Branch of the Appellant Company. According to the

submitted documents, the employees were granted their New Year’s Holidays by the

Employer from 08.04.2009 till 27.04.2009. During the period of the said holidays, the

Employer posted letters of transfer dated 15.04.2009 (1st letter of transfer), transferring

the Employees of the Niyagama factory to the factories at Dehiwala and Karandeniya

with effect from 27.04.2019.

In the meantime, the Employer had sought a notice of injunction and an

enjoining order from the District Court on 20.04.2009, against all the Employees (who

were 413 in number) from entering the factories at Niyagama and Karandeniya, on the

alleged basis of a reasonable suspicion that there could be a possibility of unrest. On

23.04.2009, an ex-parte enjoining order was granted by the District Court of Elpitiya,

restricting the Employees from entering the said factories.

On 24.04.2009, a mediation process was attempted. During the said mediation

process, the Employer suggested a slightly higher payment, if the Employees agreed to

report at the new workplace and the Employer, upon Board Approval further agreed,

that compensation could be paid to those who do not report to the new workplace. For

that purpose, another meeting was fixed on 12.05.2009. However, the Employer posted

letters of warning dated 30.04.2009 (2nd letter of transfer), in which it was notified that

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 113 of 131

an opportunity had been given to the Employees to report for duty at the relevant place

of duty, on or before 11.05.2009 and it was further notified that, the services of any

employee who fails to report for duty on or before the said date, would be terminated.

On 12.05.2009, as agreed to previously, both parties were present before the

Commissioner of Labour, wherein it was informed that the employees were unwilling to

report to the new workplace. Further, discussions were held to reopen the factory with

250 employees and for that, the Employer had to obtain approval of the Board.

Therefore, another meeting was fixed on 15.05.2009 and on the said date, the

Employees were present while the Employer was absent and unrepresented.

Upon notices being served on the Employees, they had appeared at the District

Court of Elpitiya but the Employer was absent and unrepresented. Therefore, the

enjoining order was dissolved. Thereafter, the Employer issued letters dated 19.05.2009

(3rd letter of transfer), in the form of a notice of vacation of post, stating that, the

Employees would be treated as having vacated their posts, if they fail to report to duty

by 01.06.2009.

Following the above events, the Employees had filed their respective Applications

in the Labour Tribunal of Galle on 06.05.2009 against the Appellant, seeking

reinstatement in service with back wages or in the alternative, compensation in lieu of

reinstatement. The President of the Labour Tribunal of Galle consolidated the

Applications and heard the matters together. The President of the Labour Tribunal held,

by order dated 24.09.2010, that there was a constructive termination of employment

and directed the Employer to pay Rs. 26,668,995/- in respect of all employees

(breakdown of the details of payment were provided). The Applications before the

Labour Tribunal were filed by 413 workmen, but the Order of the Labour Tribunal is

limited to the 224 workmen who had participated in the Trial.

Aggrieved by the order of the Labour Tribunal, the Employer filed an Appeal

dated 27.10.2010, before the High Court of Galle. After considering the submissions

made by both parties, the Learned Judge of the High Court dismissed the Appeal on

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 114 of 131

04.06.2013 and further, awarded costs at the sum of Rs. 1000/- to each of the

Respondents. Thereafter, the Employer had preferred the present Appeal before us.

Having heard the Counsel in support of the present Appeal, this Court had

granted leave on the questions of law set out in paragraph 13(b), (e), (h), (l), (m) and (q)

of the Petition dated 12.07.2013, which have been reproduced for easy reference.

“(b) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to

appreciate the fact that the Transfer of the Respondents were prima facie

lawful and justified?

(e) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law and misdirected

himself in holding that the Transfer of the Respondents amounts to

constructive termination of their services, particularly when the same is

not supported by reasons in the impugned order?

(h) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in holding that the

Petitioner had acted mala fide in obtaining an enjoining order from the

District Court of Elpitiya, especially in view of the finding by the Labour

Tribunal that the Petitioner did so to safeguard the property of the

Petitioner Company?

(l) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to consider

that, the Respondents had not proved their losses and/or established any

basis for the award to them of compensation?

(m) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to consider

the established authorities of the superior courts as regards the grant of

compensation, and, contrary to law awarded compensation

‘mechanically’ to all employees regardless of age, employability, skill etc.

of the Respondents and affordability of the Petitioner?

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 115 of 131

(q) Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to make a

just and equitable order?”

In addition to the aforesaid, the following question of law was raised by the

Counsel for the Respondents on 02/07/2014.

“Is the Appellant entitled to any relief in these proceedings in view of the

findings of fact made by the Learned Labour Tribunal President?”

Both Counsels have filed their written submissions and the matter was argued

before us. The stance taken by the employees is that, their services were constructively

terminated, but on the contrary, the Employer had submitted that, there was no

termination and that, it was only a transfer order.

I find that, the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal, in his judgment made a

specific finding that, the transfers were mala fide on 8 grounds (vide pages 3452 to

3456). The same has been reproduced for easy reference.

“i. The instant transfers were mass scale transfers without sufficient prior

notice.

ii. Convenience of the workmen and individual issues of the individual

workmen should have been considered individually and it is the duty of

the employer to give a platform to submit appeals setting out their

grievances.

iii. The employer has offered to pay Rs. 2000/- for those who have been

transferred to Dehiwala, but the evidence show that, this amount is

anyway not sufficient for accommodation and meals.

iv. In making transfers, the employer has not considered the financial

challenges that might arise in respect of those employees, especially since

the employees were earning very low salaries, approximately Rs. 6300/- a

month.

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 116 of 131

v. Had there been a genuine economic reason to close down the factory,

such closure would have been justified and the employer should have

followed the Termination of Employment (Special Provisions) Act No. 45

of 1971;

vi. The Employer had made use of the New Year vacation to transfer

employees and to resort to a District Court for Enjoining Order preventing

them from entering the factory. It is very clear that, there was no actual

evidence, but only reasonable suspicion that any disturbance would

happen.

vii. The transfers were effected for a long distance, but sufficient notices

were not given.

viii. The workmen had not been given any opportunity to appeal against

the transfer.”

As per the above findings, the President of the Labour Tribunal had stated that,

the said transfers are tainted with malice and unfair labour practices and are therefore,

unjustified.

The Counsel for the Appellant had contended that, the transfer was lawful since

there was a specific clause in the letters of appointment, providing that the employment

of the Respondents was transferable. It was further contended that, the letters of

appointment were signed and accepted by the Respondents, thereby constituting a

‘Contract of Employment’ between the Appellant and each of the Respondents.

With regard to the above contention, I find it apposite to produce the relevant

excerpts from the below-mentioned cases.

In the case of United Engineering Workers’ Union v. Devanayagam, 69 NLR

289, it was observed that-

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 117 of 131

“A Labour Tribunal, an arbitrator and an Industrial Court are required to

do what is just and equitable and it is expressly provided that a Labour

Tribunal when dealing with an application is not restricted by the terms

of the contract of employment in granting relief or redress.”

(Emphasis added)

In the case of National Radio Corporation v. Their Workmen 1963, (1) LLI 282

SC, it was held that-

“Even if there is provision made in the contract of employment, if any

transfer is done “mala fide” that transfer is not a legitimate transfer.”

In the case of Ceylon Estates Staff’s Union v. The Superintendent,

Meddecombra Estate, Watagoda, Wattagoda, (1986) 1 calr 102/73 NLR 278, it was

observed that-

“There is of course no general principle that an employee is in all cases

bound to accept such a transfer order under protest, for there may be cases

where the mala fides prompting such an order is so self-evident … the right to

transfer has been conceded as a right inherent in the employer … the only

grounds on which the transfer in this case has been resisted namely that the

exercise of the power was not bona fide and that it should not in any event

harm the employee, have not, as already observed, been proved.”

(Emphasis added)

In the aforesaid Judgment, Justice Weeramantry (as he was then) firmly

established that although the employer has an inherent right to transfer an employee, it

should not be mala fide and that, it should not in any event harm the employee.

I have observed that, the employees transferred from the Niyagama Factory had

been prohibited from entering the premises of the Niyagama Factory and the

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 118 of 131

Karandeniya Factory, by virtue of the injunction that was obtained by the Employer. The

Employer should have sought the injunction only if there was scope for reasonable

suspicion that, there existed anxiety amongst the Employees such that it could have

resulted in them indulging in a conduct that ought to have been restrained. However, I

find that, there is no evidence of violence or industrial unrest among the Employees,

some of whom have been employed for more than 10 years.

It is evident from the 3rd letter of transfer that, the Employer has stated that the

Employees would be treated as having vacated their posts, if they fail to report to duty

by 01.06.2009. I am of the view that, the concept of vacation of post involves two

aspects- one, is the mental element i.e. the intention of the Employee to desert and

abandon the employment and the second, is the physical absence i.e. the failure of the

employee to report at the designated workplace, which in this case is the Factory at

Dehiwala or Karandeniya. To constitute the mental element, it must be established that

the Employee who had refrained from reporting at the work place was actuated by an

intention to voluntarily vacate his employment.

Moreover, the view that the physical absence and the mental element must co-

exist for there to be a vacation of post in law, was affirmed in the case of Nelson De

Silva v. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation (1996) 2SLR 342(CA case) wherein,

it was observed-

“A temporary absence from a place does not mean that the place is

abandoned; there must be shown also an intention not to return. So, to

the physical failure to perform a contractual duty there must be added

the intention to abandon future performance. A reasonable explanation

may negative the intention to abandon. A bonafide challenge to the

validity of an order is a satisfactory explanation for not complying with it.

By challenging the order the complainant was affirming the contract not

abandoning it.”

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 119 of 131

I find that, in the present case, there is no evidence of the presence of the mental

element i.e. the intention of the Employee to desert and abandon the employment.

Therefore, I am of the view that, in the given circumstances, the failure to comply with

the letters of transfer does not amount to a vacation of post.

Moreover, I find that, the Employer has failed to comply with the legal provisions

relating to the transfer and these transfers were made stealthily and without considering

the economic and social hardships faced by the employees. With the given facts, it can

be observed that the Employer-Employee relationship was seriously breached by the

Employer. Accordingly, I conclude that the act of the Employer is deemed to be a

constructive termination of service.

In light of the above analysation, I am of the view that, the learned High Court

Judge has not erred in his observations regarding the questions of law, marked as (b),

(e) and (h).

Answering the question of law marked as (l), I am of the view that, the Appellant

Company has failed to prove its losses as a result of “Global Financial Downturn” before

the Labour Tribunal. The Appellant produced Audited Accounts of Paradigm Clothing

[Private] Limited as a whole and that cannot be considered as the separate Accounts of

the Niyagama Factory. It is stated and observed that, in page 45 of the order of the

Learned President of the Labour Tribunal,

¶'' tA wkqj i;H jYfhkAu foysj," lrkAfoksh" ksh.u hk l¾udkA;Yd,d ;=ku mdvq

,enqfõo@ bkA tllA mdvq ,enqfõo@ hkAk fidhd .ekSug idlAIshlA úksYAphdêldßhg

bosßm;A ù fkdue;'¶

Answering the questions of law (m) and (q), I am of the view that, the order of the

President of the Labour Tribunal is just and equitable and well considered. In page 69 of

the order of the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal stated that,

¶f˜ysoS fiajlhkaf.a fiajd ld,h " jegqma i,ld ne,SfïoS úúO fiajd ld,hka tkï"

udi 11 isg jir 9"10 jeks fiAjlhkA isák nj fmfkA'¶

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 120 of 131

It is evident that, the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal considered the

age, salary and period of service of the employees while preparing the breakdown of

compensation, which was considered and affirmed by the Learned High Court Judge.

For the reasons already enumerated by me, I answer the questions of law set out

in paragraph 13, marked as (b), (e), (h), (l), (m) and (q) in the negative. Accordingly, I

agree with the order of the Learned High Court Judge and the findings of the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal. Further, in response to the question of law raised by

Counsel for the Respondents on 02.07.2014, as reproduced previously, I am of the view

that, the Appellant is not entitled to any relief in these proceedings and therefore,

answer the same in the negative.

Appeal dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

BUWANEKA ALUWIHARE, PC, J.

I have had the benefit of reading the judgement of his Lordship Justice Thurairaja

PC. I am in agreement with the reasoning and the conclusions reached by his Lordship

in this matter, in particular that the termination of employment of the workers (the

Respondents) concerned, amounts to constructive termination and that it was unjust.

Lately, however, this court has observed that there had been failures on the part

of the learned Presidents of the Labour Tribunals to adhere to well-settled principles in

awarding compensation to Applicants, who invoke the jurisdiction of the Labour

Tribunals.

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 121 of 131

It is in this context that leave was granted by this court on the following question

of law:

“Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing to consider the

established authorities of the superior courts as regards the grant of

compensation, and, contrary to law awarded compensation ‘mechanically’

to all employees regardless of age, employability, skill etc. of the

Respondents and affordability of the Petitioner? ” (Subparagraph “m” of

paragraph 13 of the Petition, emphasis added).

In this backdrop, I wish to state my own observations on the aspect of awarding

compensation by the Labour Tribunals.

The provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of 1950 equip the Labour

Tribunals with broad powers for awarding relief in general, and compensation in

particular, for unjust terminations.

Under powers vested with the Labour Tribunals to grant relief in general, Section

31B(4) of the Industrial Disputes Act provides that a Labour Tribunal may grant “relief or

redress” to a workman notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any contract of

service between him and his employer. Tambiah J. in Walker Sons & Co Ltd v. Fry 68

NLR 73 at page 113 stated that “Relief may be given to a workman although the

employer has adhered to the terms of the contract and has fulfilled his legal

obligation” (emphasis added).

Further expanding the powers of a Labour Tribunal to grant relief, Section

31C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act provides that when an application is preferred to a

Labour Tribunal under the Act, a duty is imposed upon it to make all such inquiries

into that application and hear all such evidence, and make a “just and equitable

order”.

In the landmark case, Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber and Estates Ltd v.

Hillman [(1977) 79 (1) NLR 421] at page 429, Sharvananda J.(as he then was) has

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 122 of 131

encapsulated the gist of both these provisions as follows: “[T]he question …is not

whether the employment has been terminated in terms of the contract between the parties

or according to law, but whether the employee has … a claim, in justice and equity,

to compensation or other benefit for the loss of career resulting from the

termination (emphasis added).” In the above case, Sharvananda J. further stated that a

Labour Tribunal is entitled to grant compensation in just and equitable terms, even

where the termination is consequent to the exercise by the employer of his fundamental

right to close down the business.

Therefore, it can be established at the outset that despite the claim by the

Appellant Company that the Letters of Appointment (which are in effect the contracts of

employment) of the workmen, contained their agreement to accept and obey any

transfer order, the Labour Tribunal can order relief disregarding such contractual terms,

if in its view, it is just and equitable to do so.

As regards the power of a Labour Tribunal to grant compensation in particular,

Section 33(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act provides that any award of the Labour

Tribunal may contain decisions “as to the payment by any employer of compensation to

any workman, the amount of such compensation or the method of computing such

amount, and the time within which such compensation shall be paid.”

Further, Sections 33(5) and 33(6) respectively provide for a Labour Tribunal to

make an order for compensation in lieu of reinstatement if the workman so requests,

and as an alternative to reinstatement where the Tribunal thinks fit so to do.

The impugned Labour Tribunal order, refers (at page 49) to the letter dated

24.04.2009 issued by the Labour Commissioner (Labour Relations), marked ‘A14’, which

contains the terms to which the two parties agreed consequent to a mediation process,

including inter alia the agreement, that those who do not wish to resume work upon

the transfers will be paid compensation. It is also mentioned in the order, that this

fact was not contested by the Respondent Company (the ‘Appellant’ in the present

case). The mediation process pursuant to which the parties agreed to pay and receive

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 123 of 131

compensation, did not specify the criteria for calculating the quantum, nor does the

Industrial Disputes Act. However, jurisprudence in this regard, has introduced several

criteria which should be taken into consideration in the assessment of the quantum of

compensation.

I am firmly of the view that there is a duty cast on the learned Presidents of the

Labour Tribunals to give due regard to the criteria when awarding just and equitable

compensation.

In the case of The Ceylon Transport Board v. Wijeratne (1975) 77 NLR 481, this

Court analysed the concept of compensation in detail and listed down several aspects

that ought to be factored in, when determining the quantum of compensation. These

include: nature of the employer’s business and his capacity to pay, the employee’s age, the

nature of his employment, length of service, seniority, present salary, future

prospects, opportunities for obtaining similar alternative employment, his past conduct,

manner of the dismissal, effect of the dismissal on future pension rights, any sums paid or

actually earned or which should also have been earned since the dismissal took place

(emphasis added).

Quite apparently, ‘quantum of compensation’ involves a whole gamut of issues

that range from the solvency of the employer, moral entitlement of the employee, to the

immediate aftermath of termination. The reason for injecting such an expansive formula

into this equation is to ensure that a Court in awarding compensation would not

haphazardly disturb the business equilibrium. The field of labour law has striven at every

step to offset the uneven bargaining power between the parties equitably; however

‘equity’ does not invite selective application of law, nor does it promote the interests of

one party to the complete exclusion of the other.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal has, (as stated on pages 69 and 71

of the LT order), incorporated only the distinctions among the employees in length of

service, terminal/present salary and the nature of employment (designation), for the

purpose of constructing the formula for calculating the amount of compensation

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 124 of 131

payable to each employee. The factors; Opportunities for obtaining alternative

employment, the nature of the employer’s business, employer’s ability to pay, employees’

age and the manner of dismissal, although mentioned in the order, have been

conveniently overlooked by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal in determining

the quantum of compensation.

I cite with approval the observations made in the case of Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka

State Plantations Corporation (1995) 2 Sri LR 379 at page 413, where it was held that

“it is not sufficient to recite a sort of litany of factors to which Presidents of Labour

Tribunals who are making computations are supposed to respond… and be merely

mentioned and left, as it were, in the air”. In the present case too, dismayingly, the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal has limited herself to the mere itemization of

the above factors, and failed to consider at all, several other key criteria in computing

compensation.

The Appellant is a business establishment engaged in the manufacture of

clothing for export. Necessarily, the success of the business is contingent upon market

forces, to be precise the ‘demand’ for clothing in the overseas markets. The learned

counsel for the Appellant in the course of his submissions contended that due to the

global economic downturn in 2006, the orders placed with the Appellant for finished

garments dwindled and as a result, manufacturing of garments had to be drastically

reduced. The fact that the Appellant suffered losses during 2006-2008, albeit for

different reasons, had been admitted to a certain extent by the Respondents, as per the

LT order (page 47). It was in this backdrop, the learned counsel submitted, that the

management of the Appellant company decided to close down the factory at Niyagama

and to transfer the workforce of the said factory to their other two factories at Dehiwela

and Karandeniya, with an offer of an additional allowance amounting to Rs. 2000 to

each employee, in order to offset the additional expenses they may have to incur in

reporting to work at far off places from their homes. Although many employees did take

the offer, the Respondents refused to do so, and the Appellant had treated the

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 125 of 131

Respondent as having vacated their employment. These are factors, the learned

President ought to have considered in arriving at the quantum of compensation to be

ordered.

In this regard the case of Jayasuriya (supra) is of significance. The employee’s

duty to mitigate his/her loss was supported in that case, (at pages 411 and 412) where it

was held that an employee must mitigate his/her loss by taking an offer of

employment reasonably offered to him/her, acting as if he/she had no hope of seeking

compensation from the previous employer. A similar practice of the U.K. Industrial

Courts is reflected in Scottish and Newcastle Breweries plc v. Halliday [1986] ICR 577,

where it was stated that the applicant employee is under a duty to mitigate his/her loss

so far as possible, in the sense that he/she should take reasonable steps to obtain other

employment. Whether in the present application the employees had breached this duty

of mitigating their losses, is not known, due to the absence of evidence regarding

employees’ acceptance or refusal of alternative employment.

Similarly, the Labour Tribunal has overlooked Justice Vythialingam’s criterion laid

down in Wijeratne (supra), i.e. compensating the loss of employment and legitimate

expectations for the future in that employment. In the present case, the workmen

who unsuspectingly left the factory for the usual Sinhala New Year vacations had no

knowledge of any urgent need to abruptly close down the factory wherein they were

employed for many years, and entertained legitimate expectations of continuing to work

there. The impact of these unfavourable circumstances on the employees should have

been taken into account by the learned President of Labour Tribunal in computing the

sum of compensation.

This Court held in the case of Jayasuriya (supra) that it is preferable to have

compensation computed based on specific headings and items of loss. These

headings are namely; 1) approximate computation of immediate loss (loss of wages

from the date of dismissal to the final judgment), 2) prospective future loss and 3)

loss of retirement benefits. These factors were considered in that case as the “data

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 126 of 131

which is necessary to determine the orbit of every Tribunal, so as to prevent it from

straying off its course” [page 409].

However, in the present impugned order by the Labour Tribunal, the LT had

strayed away, by failing to accurately assess the immediate loss/actual financial loss

suffered by the employees, which was claimed by the learned President as the sole basis

for granting compensation [page 71 of the order]. In calculating financial loss, firstly, the

loss of earnings has to be calculated from the date of dismissal to the final

determination of the case. From this amount, the Tribunal should deduct any wages or

benefits paid by the employer after termination, as well as remuneration from fresh

employment.

It has been held that if the employee had obtained equally beneficial or

financially better alternative employment, he should receive ‘no compensation’ at all, for

he suffers no loss; if it’s a less remunerative job, compensation should be ‘reduced by

such amount earned’. The whole basis of such quantification of immediate loss, was the

principle that the ‘employee is entitled to indemnity but not profit’. [Jayasuriya at page

411].

Similarly, in Liyanage v. Weeraman (SC 235/72 – SC Minutes of 31.01.1974), it

was held that the amount earned by a workman after his dismissal (through

alternative employment) is deductible from the compensation otherwise awardable to

him.

Even though in Jayasuriya (supra) and Nidahas Karmika Saha Velenda

Sevaka Vurthiya Samithiya v. Continental Motors Ltd. ID 32 CGG 11,224 of 27.12.57

at para 5, it was noted that if an employee obtains equally beneficial or financially better

alternative employment after dismissal, he should receive ‘no compensation’, as no loss

is caused to the employee, the Industrial Courts of the U.K. have not gone to that extent.

It was held in Fentiman v. Fluid Engineering Products Ltd [1991] ICR 570 that if an

employee obtains new employment at a higher rate of pay, then the Industrial Tribunal

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 127 of 131

should calculate the compensatory award on the basis of the loss suffered from the date

of dismissal up to the date when the new employment commenced.

In the present case, the Labour Tribunal has resorted to a mechanical formula of

3 months’ salary for each year of service in calculating compensation for all 224

Respondents. The employees’ respective losses of earnings from the date of dismissal to

the date of the LT order had not been calculated, nor has remuneration obtained from

fresh employment been deducted from that sum, as no evidence had been adduced by

the Applicants regarding the securing of alternative employment. Therefore, no

mitigating effect on the employees’ loss of earnings was considered, nor was it

considered whether any unemployed worker remained so through a fault of his/her

own.

As regards the absence of evidence on a key factor in calculating the immediate

loss, such as the securing of alternative employment, in Jayasuriya (above), it was

determined that the burden is on the employee to adduce sufficient evidence to

enable a Labour Tribunal to decide the loss. But such failure to provide evidence

should be considered against the employee, and not as a ground to award an enhanced

amount of compensation, by disregarding any remuneration he/she earned from

alternative employment. As the Employment Appeal Tribunal observed in Adda

International Ltd. V Curcia [1976] 3 All ER 620, 624 as cited in Jayasuriya on page

415, "The tribunal must have something to bite on and if an applicant produces nothing

for it to bite on, he will have only himself to blame if he gets no compensation". Therefore,

the failure on the part of the employees to adduce such evidence, should have been

factored in to prevent possible overcompensation or under-compensation.

In terms of Section 31C(1) of the IDA, it is the duty of the Tribunal to make all

such inquiries into the application and hear all such evidence as it may deem

necessary, untrammelled by the rules of evidence and after adopting such procedure, to

make such order as may appear to the Tribunal to be just and equitable. [Wijeratne,

page 488]

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 128 of 131

Substantiating the above view, Nigel Hatch in “Commentary on the Industrial

Disputes Act of Sri Lanka” (1989) at page 271, reiterates the procedure provided in

Section 31C(1) of the IDA, and at page 272 states that “the requirement to record…

tendered evidence is no bar to the adjudicator calling in addition any “necessary”

evidence.” [emphasis added]

However, in the impugned Labour Tribunal order, it is deemed that the learned

President had failed to make “all such inquiries” and call all “necessary” evidence, in

order to avoid placing the employees in a more favourable position than they ought to

be in. In the order, a question lingers as to whether the Labour Tribunal has not correctly

calculated the actual financial loss and has not called for evidence of the reception or

otherwise of alternative employment by the employees, and of the remuneration

received by them after securing such employment.

The additional criteria of considering the employee’s advanced age, and the

type of work he was engaged in, which would render it improbable for him to obtain

employment in the same capacity, was elaborated on in Raymond v Ponnusamy (SC

57/69 – SC Minutes of 10.12.1969). Accordingly, the monetary value of a workman’s

balance work-span has to be taken into account, which the learned President of the LT

had apparently unheeded in the present case, but had only cursorily mentioned ‘age’ as

a relevant consideration at Page 69 of the Order.

As the foregoing discussion of relevant criteria points out, any award of

compensation must consider each employee separately and the tests must be applied to

each employee, when deciding the loss that each has suffered. In this respect, there

must be separate evidence relating to each Respondent. In the absence of such

evidence, the Tribunal cannot award compensation as it cannot assume or hypothesize

the loss that each has made.

In Jayasuriya (supra) at page 407, Dr. Amerasinghe J. stated that, “while I

respectfully agree that the amount of compensation should not be “mechanically”

calculated and that Labour Tribunals have a wide discretion, there is… no power

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 129 of 131

conferred by the Legislature on Labour Tribunals to act without unhampered

restraint” (emphasis added). Although restraint must be accordingly exercised, it must

be reiterated that in the instant case, the formula for compensation constructed by the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal can be deemed a strictly mechanical formula

through which 3 months’ salary for each year of service as compensation has been

awarded to all 224 Respondents. Any consideration of the criteria subjective to each

employee, discussed above in detail, is absent. Hence, compensation awarded in the

present case- which was calculated mainly based on the past services of the employees-

as pointed out by Alles, J. in Uplands Tea Estates Ltd. Vs. The Ceylon Workers'

Congress (72 N. L. R. 68), was more akin to the payment of gratuity than compensation.

In calculating the ‘actual financial loss’ suffered by each employee for the

purpose of indemnifying it, merely taking into consideration the three criteria; the length

of service, present salary and the designation, may cause unfairness and inequity in the

absence of consideration of the other criteria enumerated above.

In the case of Hayleys Ltd. v. de Silva (64 NLR 130 at page 131) Weerasooriya J.

opined that, a similar duty is cast on the Industrial Court, as on the Labour Tribunal to

“take such decision or make such award as may appear to the Court just and equitable”

(which) by necessary implication requires the Court to consider and decide every

material question involved in a dispute… A failure on the part of the Industrial Court

to consider and decide a question which the statute (IDA) requires the Court to decide

would be an error of law” (emphasis added). The failure of the learned President of

the Labour Tribunal to consider the above criteria, which are subjective to each

employee, in constructing the compensation formula, is therefore an omission of

material concerns, leading to an error of law.

The High Court judgment, however, had simply affirmed the sums of

compensation ordered by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal.

In these circumstances, it is clear that the Labour Tribunal has overlooked several

of the established criteria, material to the computation of compensation, which could

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 130 of 131

either reduce and/or increase the sum awardable as compensation. As pointed out in

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (1) (1940-1942) 24 TC 498 at 501, “Court

has always jurisdiction to intervene if it appears... that the Tribunal has made a finding for

which there is no evidence”.

It must also be borne in mind that as commendably observed in Jayasuriya

(supra) at page 407, a Labour Tribunal in calculating the quantum of compensation is

expected to, “after a weighing together of the evidence and probabilities in the case…form

an opinion of the nature and extent of the loss, arriving in the end at an amount that a

sensible person would not regard as mean or extravagant, but would rather

consider to be just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case” (emphasis

added).

Considering the above, I answer the question of law raised in paragraph “m”

referred to above, in the affirmative. As I have stated above, the employees would

legitimately be entitled to compensation and the only issue that is to be decided is the

quantum of compensation applying the criteria referred to herein before.

Having answered the question in the affirmative, I make haste to observe that this

litigation has run its course since 2012. The long delay attached to this case, taken

together with the admission by the employer, that the Respondents are entitled to

compensation, warrants that there be an end to the litigation with an outcome that

serves justice to both parties. It is possible that the Respondents may be entitled to

more compensation than what was awarded to them by a mechanical formula. It is also

possible that the Appellant may have been able to contest that amount, had they

adduced substantial evidence with regard to their capacity to pay. The absence of such

evidence in the judgment is as much a failure by the respective parties as it is by the

Labour Tribunal. However, taking into account the concerns of the Respondents and the

fact that the Appellant business had several branches which speaks of the availability of

the resources, I am of the view that it is reasonable, in the unique circumstances of this

case, that the Appellant company pay Rs. 26,668,995/- to the Respondents minus the

SC Appeal 106/2014 JUDGMENT Page 131 of 131

accrued interest. Accordingly, I make order directing the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal to have the monies deposited by the Appellant be paid to the Respondents

(employees), and the interest accrued on the sum of Rs.26,668,995/- be paid to the

Appellant.

Appeal dismissed subject to the variation referred to.
