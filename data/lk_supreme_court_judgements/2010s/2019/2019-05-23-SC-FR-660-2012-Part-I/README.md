JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The facts pertaining to this case could be summarized as follows. The

Petitioner’s son Mariyadas Nevis Delrokson was arrested by the CID in

5 Vavuniya on 17th October 2009. He was 36 years of age and an unmarried

person.1

Thereafter, the Petitioner’s son was indicted before the Vavuniya High

Court on three separate indictments, copies of which have been produced,

marked P4 A, P4 B and P4 C.2 He was kept in remand custody in

Vavuniya Prison.

On or about 2012-06-26, the inmates of Vavuniya prison in which the

Petitioner’s son was also kept, had commenced a protest campaign and a

hunger strike, protesting against the transfer of the prisoner by the name

of Nadaraja Saravanapavan to Boossa detention camp. The protesting

inmates had demanded that the said transferred prisoner be brought back

to Vavuniya prison.3

The reasons given by the Petitioner in his affidavit4 for the said protest

campaign and the hunger strike are as follows.

i. ‘The Boossa detention camp is known to be notorious for the

infliction of extreme physical and mental torture on prisoners and

1 Paragraph 5 of the affidavit of the Petitioner. 2 Paragraph 7 of the affidavit of the Petitioner. 3 Paragraph 8 of the affidavit of the Petitioner. 4 Paragraph 8 of the affidavit of the Petitioner.

6

that it will adversely affect the prisoner and his fundamental right to

a fair trial.’

ii. ‘The prisoners also consider that the said Boossa camp is an illegal

detention camp.’

Perusal of the material adduced before this Court in this case, clearly

shows that the Petitioner has not proved by any yardstick, the veracity of

the above two assertions. The Petitioner has not even explained as to how

he was able to ascertain the above information and the basis upon which

he gives them as the reasons behind the protest campaign and the hunger

strike launched by the inmates of Vavuniya prison.

It is to be borne in mind that the Petitioner was not amongst the inmates

of Vavuniya prison at that time. In the absence of any indication by the

Petitioner regarding the source of the above information, this Court has to

conclude that the above assertions by the Petitioner are either based

purely on hearsay material or mere speculations by him. This Court cannot

treat such material as evidence and hence cannot act upon the Petitioner’s

above assertions.

Although, the Petitioner in the prayers of his petition has prayed for a

declaration by this Court that his fundamental rights guaranteed under

7 Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Constitution have been violated, this Court

when this application was supported on 03-10-2014, having heard the

submissions of the learned counsel for the Petitioner and the submissions

of the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Respondents,

had decided to grant leave to proceed only under Article 11 of the

Constitution. Thus, the task of this Court at this moment must be restricted

only to a probe to ascertain whether the Respondents have infringed the

fundamental rights of the petitioner (or his deceased son) guaranteed

under Article 11 of the Constitution. With that in mind, it would be

opportune at this moment to turn to the position taken up by the

Respondents regarding the incident relevant to this case, which occurred in

Vavuniya prison.

According to the affidavit5 filed by the 4th Respondent (Commissioner

General of Prisons) following positions have been revealed.

1) The prisoner Nadaraja Sarawanapavan was transferred to Boossa

detention camp on the 26th June 2012 consequent to an order made

5 Affidavit dated 30th March 2015.

8

by the High Court of Vavuniya on 25th June 2012.6 (A copy of this

order produced marked R 2 has confirmed this position).

2) On or about 26th June 2012, several inmates of Vavuniya prison

including the Petitioner’s son (Delrokson) commenced engaging in a

hunger strike demanding the said transferred suspect be brought

back to the Vavuniya prison.

3) Certain inmates in pursuance of the said demand and in the process

of their protest campaign,

i. had vandalized the visitors area of the Prison7 and

ii. had taken three prison guards namely S K G Chandrasiri, N M

Rohitha and S B Rathnayaka hostage and continue to hold the

said prison guards and a number of other prisoners in their

captivity within the Vavuniya prison premises.8

4) All attempts to negotiate with the hostage takers and persuade them

to release the hostages who were in their custody and all attempts to

regain official control of the prison premises and restore order within

the prison premises had failed. 9

6 Paragraph 12 of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 7 Paragraph 24(a) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 8 Paragraph 24(d) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 9 Paragraph 24(f) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent.

9

5) Consequently, as the tension in the Vavunia Prison had increased,

the prison authorities were compelled to seek the assistance of the

Special Task Force to conduct a rescue operation on the 29th June

2012. 10

6) Owing to the stiff resistance by the hostage takers, the officers

engaged in the rescue operation were compelled to use force to

rescue the prison guards and other inmates held hostage in the

captivity of the rioters as well as to regain official control and restore

law and order within the Prison. 11

7) Subsequent to the rescue operation, Vavunia Prison was closed and

all the inmates were transferred to Anuradhapura and Mahara prisons

as the authorities thought it fit to take steps to split up the

prisoners/remandees with a view of preventing any possible re-

grouping of the hostage takers.12

8) The persons requiring medical attention were taken to the hospital

and the Petitioner’s son was warded in the Ragama hospital. 13

10 Paragraph 24(f) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 11 Paragraph 24(h) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 12 Paragraph 24(i) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent. 13 Paragraph 24(j) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent.

10 It is the position of the 4th Respondent that any injury sustained by the

Petitioner’s son may have been caused during the exchanges that had

taken place during the rescue operation. 14

The prison authorities had subsequently (on 4th July 2012) conducted an

inquiry into the relevant incident. The 4th Respondent has produced a copy

of the report of the said inquiry marked R1, along with his first affidavit

dated 23rd June 2014.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner in the course of his

submissions made clear to this Court that he is not challenging the

existence of a necessity to conduct a rescue operation by the Respondents

inside the prison to free the three prison guards taken hostage by the

rioting inmates. His complaint was limited to the allegation that the

authorities had used excessive force during this incident and that resulted

in serious injuries being caused to the Petitioner’s son who later

succumbed to the said injuries.

The Petitioner has alleged that the said use of excessive force was done

deliberately to punish or torture the Petitioner’s son whom the Petitioner

14 Paragraph 25 of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent.

11 states has been identified as one of the masterminds behind the protest

and hunger strike launched by the inmates of Vavuniya prison. It is on that

basis that the learned President’s Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

sought to argue that the Respondents had infringed the Petitioner’s (or his

son’s) fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution.

The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer of District General Hospital

Gampaha has conducted a post mortem examination of the body of the

Petitioner’s son Mariyadas Nevis Delrokson at the mortuary of Teaching

Hospital Ragama. Both the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner

and the learned Senior State Counsel who appeared for the Respondents,

relied on the findings contained in the said post mortem report. Thus, this

Court would now briefly refer to some of the relevant features contained in

the said post mortem report.

Following facts revealed from the said post mortem report would be

relevant and useful for the evaluation of the arguments advanced before

this Court by both parties in this case.

i. Petitioner’s son has died on 2012-08-08.

12

ii. It was the Petitioner (Christopher Mariyadas Thevis) who had

identified the body.

iii. The opinion of the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer regarding the

cause of death of Petitioner’s son is (i) septicaemia, (ii) prolonged

unconsciousness, (iii) head injury.15

Comments made by the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer regarding the

cause of death of Petitioner’s son set out in the last page of the said report

would be crucial to the final decision by this Court in this case.

The said comments are as follows;

I. Deceased was admitted to the Teaching Hospital Ragama on 30th

June 2012 in an unconscious state. According to the Bed Head Ticket

(BHT No. 67462/12), deceased had a tramline contusion on the

forehead and a wound on the left knee. X-rays taken at the hospital

revealed a fracture in distal part of left ulna. CT scans revealed

cerebral oedema and fracture in zygomatic bone of right side of the

face. MRI scans showed features of shearing injuries in brain.

15 Clause 20 of the post mortem report.

13

II. Autopsy revealed evidence of diffuse axonal injuries and evidence of

septicaemia. These findings are consistent with both ante mortem

clinical state and investigations findings.

III. Diffuse axonal injury of the brain is used to describe a condition

characterized by immediate prolong coma (greater than 6 hours)

occurring after head trauma, not associated with intracranial

haemorrhage or mass lesion. This is produced by a sudden

acceleration - deceleration motion of the head (assault, violent

shaking of head or fall) which causes stretching and/ or shearing of

nerve fibers. In diffuse axonal injury, the patient becomes

unconscious and survives for a long period in vegetative state and

death supervenes due to complications of the unconscious state.

Fracture zygomatic bone in right side of the face as indicated in CT

scan and BHT finding of tramline contusion on the forehead confirm

that the deceased had sustained head injury caused by blunt forces

resulting diffuse axonal injury before admit to the hospital.

IV. Autopsy revealed that the both healed and healing abrasions (injuries

1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 19). Considering the

14

external appearance, all these injuries are recent injuries and could

have been sustained during hospital stay in unconscious state.

V. In summary, the deceased was admitted to the Colombo North

Teaching Hospital, Ragama on 30th June 2012 in an unconscious

state and died on 08th August 2012 following septicaemia developed

as a complication of prolong unconsciousness due to diffuse axonal

injury caused by blunt force trauma to the head.

This Court observes that the post mortem examination has revealed the

existence of 19 external injuries (injuries Nos. 1-19) and two internal

injuries (injuries Nos. 20-21) on the body of the deceased. The Consultant

Judicial Medical Officer was of the considered opinion that the both healed

and healing abrasions found on the body of the Petitioner’s son (injuries 1,

4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 19) could have been

sustained during the hospital stay in unconscious state.16 This means that

the Petitioner’s son could not have sustained the above set of injuries

before his admission to the hospital. One has to bear in mind that the

Petitioner’s son was admitted to the hospital in an unconscious state.

16 Last page of the post mortem report. (clause 20.4)

15 In the above circumstances, this Court has to conclude that the Petitioner’s

son could not have sustained the said set of injuries during the rescue

operation conducted in the Vavunia prison.

The external injuries left out from the above list would be the external

injuries numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, and 15 only. The said injuries have been

described in the post mortem report in the following manner.

Injury No. 02 - a healing wound with a red surface, measuring 3x3 cm,

situated on the outer aspect of left leg 15 cm above the heel.

Injury No. 03 - a healing wound with a red surface, measuring 3x1 cm,

situated on the left shin 25 cm above the heel.

Injury No. 06 - a triangular slightly curved healing wound with a pigmented

surface over the distal part and reddish surface over the proximal part,

measuring 4x1 cm, situated on the front and inner aspect of left thigh 53

cm above the heel.

Injury No. 07 - a healed tramline contusion measuring 7x2 cm with a pale

center surrounded by a dark pigmented area situated obliquely on the left

calf 33 cm above the heel.

16 Injury No. 15 - a healed tramline contusion measuring 14x2 cm with a pale

center surrounded by dark pigmented area situated in the back of the left

elbow and forearm.

A notable feature of the above set of injuries is that all of those injuries

were found on the heel and the forearm of the deceased.

The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer, upon dissection of the skin and

subcutaneous tissues has found two internal injuries. It would be useful at

this stage to consider the nature of the said two internal injuries found on

the body of the deceased. They have been described in the post mortem

report as follows.

Injury No. 20 - A resolving intramuscular contusion measuring 5x4 cm

situated in the left buttock.

Injury No. 21 - A healing fracture was found in distal part of left ulna.

However, according to the post mortem report, the fracture of zygomatic

bone in right side of the face as indicated in CT scan and BHT finding of

tramline contusion on the forehead has confirmed that the deceased had

sustained head injury caused by blunt forces. This had caused diffuse

axonal injury before the deceased was admitted to the hospital. Thus, it is

17 clear that the above injury is the only serious injury the Petitioner’s son had

sustained in the course of the rescue operation.

This Court observes that the Magistrate along with Mr. Anton

Pulithanyagam Attorney-at-Law had taken steps with the help of a ladder

to climb down into the area where the rioting inmates had been continuing

with their protest campaign. They had then urged the rioting inmates to

release the three prison guards held hostage by them. According to the

inquiry report (R 1), the rioting inmates at that time had shown the three

prison guards held in their captivity to the Hon. Magistrate and Mr. Anton

Pulithanyagam Attorney-at-Law who had climbed down to that area.

Respondents have admitted that the officers of the Special Task Force had

gone into the prison to rescue the three prison guards and the other

inmates kept as hostages. The Petitioner does not allege that the officers

involved in the rescue operation were either armed or had used firearms.

Indeed the Petitioner does not allege that there was any shooting inside.

The post mortem report also does not reveal any gunshot injuries.

18 Perusal of the material adduced before this Court shows clearly that the

rioters were not prepared for a peaceful settlement of any grievance they

may have had. On the other hand, as has been mentioned before,

Petitioner has not convinced this Court that any of those inmates has had

any substantial grievance for their questionable behaviour, which had

sparked off the whole incident.

The Petitioner has not denied the fact that the rioters within the prison

premises had continued to hold three prison guards hostage in their

captivity. Thus, this Court cannot reject the position taken up by the

Respondents that it has become necessary for them to launch a rescue

operation.

In view of the observations made by the Consultant Judicial Medical

Officer, and in the light of the circumstances that prevailed in the prison at

that point of time, there is no justification for this Court to hold that the

Respondents have used more force than necessary at this instance to curb

the then prevailing situation.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner also complained that the

chaining of the leg of the Petitioner’s son to the hospital bed amounts to a

19 degrading treatment, which violates the fundamental rights, guaranteed

under Article 11 of the Constitution.

According to section 252 B (1)(c) of the Prisons Ordinance, a light chain

with single wrist cuff may be used in order to secure any prisoner who may

at any time be an inmate at a civil hospital.

In terms of the Department of Prisons standing order 732 produced

marked 4R A it is lawful for a prisoner to be chained to a bed when the

prisoner is warded in a civil hospital. In this instance, the Petitioner’s son

was in an unconscious state in the hospital. As this is something authorized

by the law and as the Respondents had not done this deliberately to

humiliate the Petitioner’s son, this Court does not see any merit in the

above argument advanced by the learned President’s Counsel for the

Petitioner.

Considering all the above material in its totality, this Court is of the view

that the Respondents in the given situation had not acted outside the law

and hence had not violated, the fundamental rights guaranteed to the

Petitioner’s son under Article 11 of the constitution.

20 In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides

that the Petitioner is not entitled to a declaration by this Court to the effect

that his fundamental rights under Article 11 of the Constitution have been

infringed by the Respondents. Hence this Court decides to refuse this

application.

This Application should therefore stand dismissed without costs.
