Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Plaintiff Respondent Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted proceedings

before the District Court of Kandy for declaration and ejectment of one Lazarus Peter George from

premises bearing assessment Number 19/4 Vihara Mawatha, Suduhumpola, Kandy. When the said

matter was pending before the District Court of Kandy, one Chandra Gunasekara claiming to be the

wife of one Gunasiri Rubasinghe sought intervention to the above case. When court permitted the

said intervention, the Plaintiff, with permission of court filed an amended plaint making the said

Chandra Gunasekara the 2nd Defendant to the case and praying a declaration that the Plaintiff is

entitled to the possession of the property in the schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the 1st

Defendant and/or any other person holding under him from the said premises.

At the beginning of the District Court Trial the learned Counsel who appeared for the 1st Defendant

had taken up the position that his client the 1st Defendant will not claim the property in question and

is willing to handover the property to the party whose rights are affirmed by the District Court. Based

on the above position taken up by the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant proceed to

trial recording one admission and raising 1-5 and 13-16 issues on behalf of the Plaintiff and 6-12 on

behalf of the 2nd Defendant.

As revealed before this court the trial before the District Court was limited to a single witness

summoned by the Plaintiff namely Kotapitiyegedara Appuhamy Maldeniya, Manager National

Housing Development Authority (NHDA) Kandy.

During the trial before the District Court the Plaintiff marked document from P-1 to P-7 through the

above witness and the defendant too had produced document 2D1 to 2D7 through the same

witness.

When the said witness was under cross examination, the 2nd Defendant had produced several

documents to establish that the property in question i.e. No 19/4 Vihara Mawatha, Suduhumpola

was offered to one Gunasiri Rubasinghe by the NHDA and thereafter a payment of Rs. 45,000/- had

been accepted from the said Gunasiri Rubasinghe. Even though the witness did not have the office

copies of those documents in the file he produced before the District Court, witness had admitted

those documents in his evidence. However the position taken by the witness before the District

Court was that, after the death of the said Gunasiri Rubasinghe a request had been made by his sister

Wimala Rubasinghe for the same property. An inquiry was held at the Head Office and during the

inquiry it was revealed that Gunasiri Rubasinghe was unmarried at the time of his death and his

father, mother and the other remaining sister had no objection for the property being given to the

said Wimala Rubasinghe. Accordingly an agreement was signed between Wimala Rubasinghe and the

NHDA to transfer the property to her after accepting Rs. 45,000/- from the said Wimala Rubasinghe.

During the trial before the District Court, the agreement between Wimala Ruibasinghe and NHDA,

affidavits received for the family members of deceased Gunasiri Rubasinghe, the request made by

Wimala Rubasinghe and the payment receipt issued in the name of Wimala Rubasinghe were

produced through witness Maldeniya.

When the witness was under cross-examination on behalf of the 2nd Defendant, it was brought to his

notice that, the property referred to in the said agreement cannot be identified since the schedule

has not been filled.

The witness whilst admitting that the schedule of the said agreement is not filled, submitted that

there is no other agreement signed in respect of the property in question and the property which

was allocated to Gunasiri Rubasinghe was granted to Wimala Rubasinghe based on the said

agreement produced (marked P-1) after an inquiry held with regard to the same property. At the

5

conclusion of the trial before the District Court, the learned District Judge whilst answering the issues

infavour of the Plaintiff had entered the judgment infavour of the Plaintiff.

Being dissatisfied with the above decision of the learned District Judge, the 2nd Defendant had

preferred an appeal before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals of the Central Province holden

in Kandy. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals had allowed the said appeal and dismissed the action of the plaintiff.

The Plaintiff Respondent before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal had preferred the present

appeal before this court, and this court on 4th May 2016 granted leave on the following questions of

law.

a) Was the High Court in err by not taking into consideration the evidence adduced by the

official from the National Housing Department to the effect that the Authority had

transferred the rights thereof to the Plaintiff as borne out by the documents contained in the

file maintained by the Authority?

b) Did the High Court err in law by ignoring the fact that the Plaintiff became entitled to the

property in suit upon the sales agreement marked me'1 which was followed by the allocation

of the premises described in the schedule of the plaint to the plaintiff?

c) Were the learned High Court Judges in error in reversing the findings arrived at by the learned

District Judge upon the evaluation of evidence adduced by the witness called by the Plaintiff

at the trial?

d) Did the High Court err in law by its failure to take into account that the contest raised by the

2nd Defendant was with regard to her right to be in possession as a mistress of the original

allottee, Gunasiri Rubasinghe and not the identity of the corpus?

6

When going through the grounds on which the leave had been granted by this court it is important to

consider the issues raised before the District Court, since the decision of the District Court will be

based on those issues raised by the parties.

As referred to in this judgment earlier, there was one admission recorded at the trial and in the said

admission both parties admitted that the property in question was belonging to the National Housing

Development Authority. When considering the above admission recorded before the District Court, it

is observed by this court that both contesting parties before the District Court had no doubt with

regard to the property in question and the said property was belonging to the NHDA.

The 2nd Defendant had raised the following issues before the District Court,

06. The property said to have acquired by the Plaintiff was sold and handed over to one

Gunasiri Rubasinghe by NHDA previously

07. Did Gunasiri Rubasinghe and the 2nd Defendant lived as husband and wife and

invested their money for the said Gunasiri Rubasinghe to purchase the said property?

08. Even though the property was in Gunasiri Rubasinghe’s name, it belongs to both the

2nd Defendant and Gunasiri Rubasinghe

09. The relationship the 2nd Defendant had with the said Gunasiri Rubasinghe amounts to

a marriage between the two under the Common Law

10. Did Gunasiri Rubasinghe died on 23.03.1993?

11. After the death of Gunasiri Rubasinghe, did the 2nd Defendant become entitled to the

his share of the properly

7

12. If the said questions are answered infavour of the 2nd Defendant, did the 2nd

Defendant entitled to the relief claimed by her in her amended answer.

When going through the above questions raised on behalf of the 2nd Defendant, it is clear that there

was no doubt with regard to the identity of the corpus and the property that is allocated to the

Plaintiff as claimed by her in her plaint was once allocated to Gunasiri Rubasinghe. As further

observed by this court, the 2nd Defendant’s case before the District Court was that, she lived with the

deceased as husband and wife prior to his death and invested their money to purchase the said

property. Therefore she too is entitled for a share of the said property and due to her marriage with

the deceased Gunasiri Rubasinghe, she is entitled to his share as well.

However when going through the proceedings before the District Court I cannot see any evidence led

before the District Court to establish the said position. Even though the 2nd Defendant had produced

some documents through the same witness (who was summoned by the Plaintiff) to establish that

the property in question was allocated to the said Gunasiri Rubasinghe by NHDA and that he paid Rs.

45,000/- to the said NHDA, the 2nd Defendant had failed to lead any evidence before the District

Court to establish that there was a marriage between Gunasiri Rubasinghe and her and the money

spent to purchase the property in question is not only belongs to the deceased Gunasiri Rubasinghe

but belongs to both.

As further observed by this court, the evidence placed before the District Court clearly established

that the property in question which was previously allocated to the Gunasiri Rubasinghe was

allocated to the Plaintiff after a full inquiry held at the Head office when the Plaintiff made a request

to allocate the said property to her after the death of the previous allottee. When allocating the said

property, the inquiry officer was satisfied that the deceased Gunasiri Rubasinghe was not married at

8

the time of his death and all the other family members had no objection for the property being

allotted to Wimala Rubasinghe who is a sister of the deceased Gunasiri Rubasinghe.

As observed by this court, the learned District Judge after analyzing the above evidence which was

placed before him during the trial was satisfied with regard to the identity of the property in question

and the failure to include the schedule to the property in me'1 has not considered as a serious laps on

the part of the Plaintiff’s case in the light of the evidence placed before him by the Plaintiff and

answered issue 1 to 5, 15 and 16 raised on behalf of the Plaintiff infavour of him.

However during the appeal before the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal, the Hon. Judges who

heard the appeal whilst analyzing the case for the Plaintiff had observed that,

“It is common ground between the parties the premises in dispute was owned by the NHDA.

The position of the Plaintiff is that she is entitled to possess these premises in terms of the

agreement to sell entered into between her and the NHDA. The said agreement is evidence

marked as P1 it was submitted by the learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant that the

aforesaid agreement was not in respect of the premises in suit.

……………………….

It does not describe the premises in respect of which the agreement was entered into

between the Plaintiff and the NHDA. Therefore the learned District Judge was not correct in

holding that the Plaintiff was entitled to possess these premises on this agreement.

and decided to allow the appeal and dismiss the action of the Plaintiff.

However as observed by this court the learned District Judge was mindful of the above position when

deciding the trial before him but he has analyzed the evidence placed before him correctly and

9

observed that property referred to in the Plaint as claimed by both parties before him is one and the

same and there is no doubt that the said property had been now granted to the Plaintiff by the NHDA

after death of Gunasiri Rubasinghe.

As further observed by this court the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal too

had concluded that the premises in dispute was owned by the ‘NHDA’ but failed to appreciate the

evidence placed before the Trial Judge and as to how the learned Trial Judge analyzed the said

evidence and answered the issues raised by both parties before him, in the absence of any contest as

to the identity of the corpus.

When considering the matters already discussed by me in this judgment, I answer the questions of

law raised before this court infavour of the plaintiff Respondent Appellant and hold that the learned

Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal had erred when they decided to allow the appeal

before them.

The appeal before this court is allowed and the Judgment of the learned District Judge Kandy is

affirmed.

Appeal allowed with costs.
