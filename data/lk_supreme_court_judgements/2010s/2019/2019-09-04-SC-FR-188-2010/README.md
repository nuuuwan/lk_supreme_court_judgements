Petitioners

Rajiv Goonetillake, SSC for the Attorney General

Argued on: 04.06.2019

Judgment on: 04.09.2019.

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioners to the present application were Sub-Inspectors of Police at the time the application

was filed before the Supreme Court. When filing the application before the Supreme Court, the

Petitioners alleged that their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution had been violated by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents, by appointing the 4th to the

17th Respondents as Inspectors of Police who do not have the 08 years of service in the rank of

Sub-Inspector as required by circular RTM 252 dated 08.02.2010.

As submitted by the Petitioners, all 109 Petitioners had joined the regular force of the Police

Department as Police Constables at various points and were promoted in their ranks and finally

promoted to the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police between 23.02.2002 and 28.02.2006.

Out of the 109 Petitioners before the court, except for 8th,14th,20th, 23rd and 29th Petitioners, all

the other Petitioners had received their promotions to the rank of Sub-Inspector by way of a

“Time promotion scheme” dated 23.02.2006.

17 By circular dated 24.02.2006 a scheme was introduced for the absorption of Reserve Police

Officers into the regular cadre with effect from 24.02.2006.

With regard to the calculation of seniority of the reservists who had been absorbed into the

Regular Service, the Petitioners, relied on two documents which were produced marked D and

F to the petition, and submitted that,

according to paragraph 5 of document D (IG’s circular 24.02.2006)

“The Reservists who are absorbed will be placed in their seniority just below their

counterparts of the Regular Cadre in the respective years in which they have been

enlisted and also as per the date on which they have been promoted to the respective

ranks”

and also according to sub paragraph (i) of National Police Commission letter dated 2nd

August 2007 addressed to IGP produced marked F,

“Seniority of officers in their respective ranks shall be determined from the date of

absorption; and they will placed junior to all officers of the Regular Police Service on

that date”

Whilst relying on the above provisions in the absorption circular and the NPC decision, the

Petitioners argued before this court that the Reserve Sub-Inspectors who were absorbed in to

the Regular Service based on the above circular will be placed junior to all officers in the

Regular Force as at 24.02.2006. The Petitioners further relied on a telephone message send on

02.08.2007 from the Inspector General of Police (TP-100), where both these appointments

namely the time promotions given to the Petitioners and absorption of the 4th -17th

Respondents had been back dated as follows;

18

a) Absorption of reserve officers to the permanent cadre on 24.02.2006 to be backdated

with effect from 01.02.2006 and

b) Time promotions given with effect from 23.02.2006 to be back dated from 01.01.2006

and further submitted that the reason behind the said message was to keep the

seniority of those who received time promotions, above those who were absorbed from the

reserve cadre.

During the argument before this court the Petitioners brought to our notice of the Supreme

Court decision in SC FR 650/2003 Manneththiyalage Pradeep Priyadarshana and 20 others Vs.

Ranjith Abeysuriya Chairman National Police Commission and 8 others SC minute dated

05.07.2006 and heavily relied on the following passage of her Ladyship Shirani Bandarayake’s

judgment in the said case,

“On a careful comparison of the characters of the Reserve Police Force and the Regular

Police Force, on the basis of the aforementioned analysis, it is evident that they belong

to two different categories without any rational nexus to link the two groups for the

purpose of putting them together.

In such circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the officers of the Regular Force and

the Reserve Force belong to two different categories and therefore the decision of the

Respondents to include clause 2.I.III in the undated circular P-1 cannot be regarded as

unequal, unfair, arbitrary or violative of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed

in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution”

As observed by this court, the crux of the argument raised on behalf of the Petitioners were

that, there was a difference between the officers of the Regular Force and Reserve Force of the

19 Police Department which is acknowledged by the department itself and the fact that telephone

message 100 was sent from the Inspector General’s Office was a clear indication of this

difference.

Whilst challenging the above position taken by the Petitioners, the 1st and 2nd Respondents

explained the difference between the Reserve Service referred to in the Supreme Court

decision in Manneththiyalage Pradeep Priyadarshana and 20 others Vs. Ranjith Abeysuriya

Chairman National Police Commission and 8 others and the reserve officers referred to in

circular RTM 252 dated 08.02.2006.

The attention of this court was drown to a Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the then

President, as the Minister of Defence and Law and Order where it was recommended to the

Cabinet that,

20 The Petitioners have submitted the corresponding Cabinet decision marked F before this court.

Whilst submitting the above Cabinet Memorandum the 1st and 2nd Respondents have taken up

the position that, those who will be absorb to the permanent cadre under the said Cabinet

decision have to satisfy that they possess all the requirements necessary to join the Regular

cadre, if they are to be absorbed to the Regular cadre on their qualifications. Those who does

not possess the basic academic qualifications need to serve 8 years in the Reserve cadre to

become eligible to be absorbed into the Regular cadre (R-2, and D)

In the circumstances it is clear from the documents produced before this court marked R-2 and

R-3 by the Respondents that, the absorption of the Reserve officers to the Regular cadre were

based on two criterias’ namely,

a) Those with required educational qualifications

b) Those with 8 years’ service

And therefore it is not correct to say that the rational identified by her Ladyship Justice Shirani

Bandaranayake in the case of Manneththiyalage Pradeep Priyadarshana and twenty others

Vs. Ranjith Abeysuriya Chairman National Police Commission and 8 others had been violated

by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents in the present case. As observed by this court, those who did

not possess the required educational qualifications were clearly identified as a different

category without putting them together with those who had the required educational

qualifications to be absorbed into the permanent cadre.

As further revealed before this court, the 4th to the 17th Respondents had joined the Reserve

cadre of the Police Department as Sub-Inspectors with the required qualifications to become a

Sub-Inspector of Police in the regular cadre and had fulfilled the required qualifications to be

21 promoted to the rank of Inspector based on RTM 252 but the 109 Petitioners before this court

had joined the Regular cadre of the Police Department as Police Constables and were promoted

to the rank of Sub-Inspector in the Regular cadre between 23.02.2002 and 01.02.2006, and had

not completed the 8 years’ of service as required by RTM 252.

In the case of C.W. Mackie Vs. Hugh Molagoda Commissioner General Inland Revenue and

others 1986 1 Sri LR 300 Sharvananda CJ concluding that “Illegality and equity are not on

speaking terms” had observed,

“Article 12 (1) of the Constitution provides “all persons are equal before the law and are

entitled to the equal protection of the law.” The essence of the right of equality

guaranteed by Article 12 (1) and the evil which the article seeks to guard against is the

avoidance of designed and intentional hostile treatment or discrimination on the part of

those entrusted with administering the law. In order to sustain the plea of

discrimination based upon Article 12 (1) a party will have to satisfy the court about two

things, namely (1) that he has been treated differently from others, and (2) that he has

been differently treated from persons similarly circumstanced without any reasonable

basis.

But the equal treatment guaranteed by Article 12 is equal treatment in the performance

of a lawful act. Via Article 12, one cannot seek the execution of any illegal or invalid act.

Fundamental to this postulate of equal treatment is that it should be referable to the

exercise of a valid right, founded in law in contradistinction to an illegal right which is

invalid in law.”

22 The 109 Petitioners who had not completed 8 years in the rank of Sub-Inspector as required by

RTM 252 are not entitled to be promoted to the rank of Inspector of Police and thereby they

have failed to establish violation under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners’ application fails and is dismissed.

I make no order with regard to costs.
