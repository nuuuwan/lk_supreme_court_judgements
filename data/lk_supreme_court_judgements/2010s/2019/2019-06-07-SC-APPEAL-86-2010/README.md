P Padman Surasena J

In this case, Hon. Attorney General had indicted the 1st Accused - Appellant

- Appellant who was named as the 1st Accused in the indictment

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Accused), the 3rd Accused -

Appellant - Appellant who was named as the 3rd Accused in the indictment

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd Accused), along with another

who was named as the 2nd Accused in the indictment (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 2nd Accused) in the High Court of Galle under

two counts.

The first count has alleged that the said accused, on or about 9th

September 1998, at Gulugahakanda, had committed the murder of one

Govindan Sevanu, an offence punishable under section 296 read with

section 32 of the Penal Code.

The 2nd count has alleged that the said accused, at the same time and in

the course of the same transaction, had caused injuries to one Sevanu

Nagaiya, an offence punishable under section 315 of the Penal Code.

The said Accused, upon the charges in the indictment being read over and

explained to them, had pleaded not guilty to the said charges.

Learned High Court Judge thereafter having conducted the trial against

them, by his judgment dated 30th June 2008 had convicted the 1st and 3rd

Accused for both counts in the indictment and had proceeded to acquit the

2nd Accused from both counts in the indictment.

Learned High Court Judge having pronounced his judgment, has

accordingly sentenced the 1st and 3rd Accused. Since the 1st and 3rd

4 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

Accused were convicted for the 1st count, which is a charge of murder, the

learned High Court Judge has imposed the death sentence on both of

them.

Being aggrieved by this conviction, 1st and 3rd Accused had appealed to the

Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal after the argument of the case, by its

judgment dated 16th December 2009 has held that there is no merit in that

appeal and had proceeded to affirm the conviction and the sentence

imposed on the said accused by the High Court. Accordingly, the Court of

Appeal had dismissed that appeal.

It is the said conviction that the 1st and 3rd Accused are seeking to canvass

before this Court in this appeal.

Upon supporting the special leave to appeal application relevant to this

appeal, this Court by its order on 30th August 2010 had granted special

leave to appeal on the following question.

Did not the nature of the evidence relating to the manner in which the

incident commenced, make it unrealistic to have merited a finding of

murder as the alleged killing had taken place on the spur of the moment,

devoid of any trace of deliberation?

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st and 3rd Accused submitted before

this Court that the incident relevant to this case is an incident occurred in

the course of a sudden fight between two neighbors. It is therefore his

contention that the dismissal of the appeal by the Court of Appeal and

affirming the conviction for the offence of murder is not justifiable. He

further submitted that the Court of Appeal should have substituted a

verdict of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under

5 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

section 297 of the Penal Code against the 1st and 3rd accused on the basis

that the relevant incident had occurred in the course of a sudden fight. It

would be necessary for this Court to briefly refer to the evidence led at the

trial in order to evaluate the above argument.

Evidence of witness Sevenu Nagaiyya

Sevenu Nagaiyya who is an eyewitness to the incident giving evidence

before the High Court has narrated the sequence of events relevant to this

incident. Some of the facts revealed from his evidence, which would be of

some use for the disposal of this appeal, could be encapsulated as follows.

i. the 2nd and the 3rd Accused are husband and wife;

ii. the 1st Accused is the son of the 2nd and the 3rd Accused;

iii. the incident occurred at about 6.30 PM on 1998-09-09;

iv. the Accused had built a kitchen adjoining their line room about a

week before this incident obstructing the pathway used by the family

of the deceased to access their line room;

v. at about 6.30 PM on the relevant day this witness went to the

boutique to purchase sugar;

vi. the 2nd accused had assaulted this witness with a hard broom;

vii. when he raised cries at that time his elder sister (Sevanu Muni

Amma) had come and prevented the said assault, and his father

(deceased) too had followed his sister;

viii. at that time the 1st accused had stabbed this witness twice with a

rubber tapping knife.

6 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

This witness has only seen his father (deceased) coming as he had become

unconscious because he had sustained stab injuries.

Evidence of witness Sevanu Muni Amma

Sevanu Muni Amma is the elder sister of the previously mentioned witness

(Sevenu Nagaiyya) who came to his rescue when he raised cries. She has

stated in her evidence;

1) that they have to pass the courtyard of the line room of the accused

to gain access to their line room;

2) that the accused had built a kitchen in their courtyard;

3) that a dispute had arisen when the deceased had knocked his head

on a rafter fixed to the newly built kitchen presumably when he was

walking pass the courtyard of the accused (not on the day of the

incident of murder occurred);

4) that this incident had occurred at a later stage;

5) that in the morning of 1998-09-09 also the 2nd and the 3rd accused

had abused the deceased;

6) that she and her father (deceased) had rushed when they had heard

his brother (Sevanu Nagaiya) raising cries;

7) that she had seen the 1st accused armed with a rubber-tapping knife

and the 3rd accused armed with a club;

8) that she had seen the 1st accused stabbing her brothers back

(Sevanu Nagaiyas back) with a rubber-tapping knife;

7 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

9) that her deceased father who was 62 years of age came there at that

time; and

10) that she had also seen the 1st accused stabbing the deceased

with a rubber-tapping knife and the 3rd accused assaulting the

deceased with a club.

According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer, there had been

ten external injuries on the body of the deceased. For the purpose of easy

comparison, the said injuries described in the post mortem report could be

arranged into a table in the following manner.

Injury No. Description Categorization by JMO

01 Cut injury of 7 cm long on the right

side of forehead 5 cm above the

eyebrow longitudinally placed

9 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

It would be of paramount importance to observe that the cause of death of

the deceased according to the Post Mortem Report is haemorrhage and

shock following stab injuries to the chest.

In the light of the above question of law to which this Court has granted

special leave to appeal and in the light of the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the accused, the issue that this Court needs to address

in this case is whether the learned High Court Judge should have convicted

the accused for an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder

on the basis that the incident relevant to this case falls under the exception

4 to section 294 of the Penal Code. The said exception is as follows.

Exception 04;

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in

a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without

the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual

manner.

The above provision clearly indicates that primarily two requirements must

be satisfied for an incident to fall under the above exception. It would not

be difficult to draw this inference due to the presence of the word and

which has clearly conjoined the phrases committed without premeditation

in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and

without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or

unusual manner.

Thus, it is clear that the followings must be proved if the conviction of the

instant case is to be brought under the above exception,

10 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

i. that the accused had acted without premeditation,

ii. that the injuries were inflicted in the course of a sudden fight,

iii. that it happened in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel,

iv. that the accused did not take any undue advantage or acted in a

cruel or unusual manner.

In the instant case the prosecution evidence does not shed even a

semblance of light on any fight. The evidence led by the prosecution and

the material elicited by the learned counsel for the accused through the

cross examination of the witnesses do not justify any inference as to the

presence of any sudden fight.

It would be in order at this stage to turn to section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance, which reads as follows;

When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general

exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the

offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances.

The legislature has proceeded to provide some examples of the instances

where the above provision comes into play. This is by setting out several

illustrations under the said provision. Thus, for the purposes of the instant

case, it would be relevant to reproduce below, the illustrations (a) and (b)

of section 105.

11 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

Illustrations

(a) A, accused of murder, alleges that, by reason of unsoundness of

mind, he did not know the nature of the act.

The burden of proof is on A.

(b) A, accused of murder, alleges that, by grave and sudden

provocation, he was deprived of the power of self-control.

The burden of proof is on A

Since section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance is specifically referring to the

special exceptions set out in the Penal Code and casting the above burden

of proof on the accused, it would not be legal for Courts to ignore the

above provisions. Further, one must bear in mind that the Courts must

presume the absence of such circumstances until and unless the accused

discharges that burden to the satisfaction of Court according to law.

In the instant case, the accused neither gave evidence no made a dock

statement. They also did not call any other witness on their behalf.

Moreover, there is not even iota of evidence elicited from the witnesses

although the said witnesses had been subjected to lengthy cross

examination by the learned Counsel who had appeared for the accused.

When two of the accused attacked the unarmed deceased who was sixty

two years of age, with a knife and a club, it stands to reason to hold that

the accused have taken an undue advantage or have acted in a cruel or

unusual manner. Thus, it is not difficult for this Court to hold that this

incident where two accused persons had attacked the unarmed deceased

person using dangerous weapons at an instance where there is no

12 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

evidence of any sudden fight, would not be within the limits of exception 4

above mentioned.

It is the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer that the haemorrhage and

shock following the stab injuries inflicted on the chest area had caused the

death of the deceased. This Court observes that there are six stab injuries

on the chest area of the deceased. Two of those stab injuries (injuries No.

04 and 05) are injuries, which are sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause the death of the deceased.

Further, the medical evidence as a whole too suggests that the accused

had taken an undue advantage and had acted in a cruel manner. This is

particularly so because there is not even an iota of evidence that any of the

accused had sustained any injury; not even a single superficial abrasion.

Perusal of the judgment of the High Court shows to the satisfaction of this

Court that the learned High Court Judge had carefully considered all

aspects he ought to have considered before concluding that the 1st

Accused and the 3rd Accused should be convicted for the offence of murder

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. Thus, this Court cannot

find any basis to deviate from the course of action that was adopted by the

Court of Appeal when it decided to affirm the judgment of the High Court

and dismiss the appeal filed before it by the said accused.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that it has no basis to

interfere with either the judgment of the Court of Appeal or that of the

High Court.

13 SC Appeal 86 / 2010

This Court answers the question of law mentioned above in the negative.

Thus, for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to affirm the judgment

of the High Court dated 30th June 2008 and the judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 16th December 2009. This appeal should therefore stand

dismissed.

This Court makes no order for costs.

Appeal is dismissed.
