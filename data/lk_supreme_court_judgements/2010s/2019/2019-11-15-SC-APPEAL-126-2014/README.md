Aluwihare PC J.

The instant Appeal arises from an order relating to an application for the payment

of maintenance to a spouse. The Applicant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes also referred to as the Applicant) made an application to the

Magistrates Court for maintenance for the child born out of her marriage to the

Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes also referred

to as the Respondent-Appellant) and for herself. On 28th March 2008, When the

Maintenance Application No. M-3938 was taken up before the Court, the parties

had entered into a settlement. The settlement was to the effect that the Respondent-

Appellant would pay Rs. 15,000/- as maintenance for the child, with Rs. 3,000/-

out of the said amount to be deposited in the Bank Account of the child and the

remainder to be handed over to the Applicant. Consequent to the said settlement

the Applicant had withdrawn the application for Maintenance for herself. Four

months after the aforesaid settlement was entered, on 28th July 2008 the Applicant,

by a fresh application (Application No.M-5240) sought to obtain maintenance for

herself in a sum of Rs. 25,000/-. The learned Magistrate, by order dated 18th

February 2011, held that the Applicant is a spouse who is capable of maintaining

herself in terms of Section 2 (1) of the Maintenance Act and proceeded to dismiss

her application for maintenance.

4

Aggrieved by the said order, the Applicant appealed to the Provincial High Court

on the grounds that the Learned Magistrate had wrongfully interpreted, both the

Section 2 of the Maintenance Act and the principles of law relating to the granting

of maintenance under the Act. The High Court by its order dated 28th March 2014,

ordered the Respondent-Appellant to pay Rs. 20,000/- as maintenance to the

Applicant with effect from 28th July 2008, the date on which the maintenance

application was originally filed in the Magistrates Court. The quantification of

compensation was based on the consideration that the Respondent required Rs.

10,000/- to pay the monthly rent for the house she and the child were living in

and that a further Rs. 10,000/- would be needed for the Applicant to maintain the

same standard of life that she maintained while living with the Respondent-

Appellant. Aggrieved, the Respondent-Appellant moved this Court seeking to set

aside the decision of the Provincial High Court.

Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law;

1. Did the High Court err in law by reversing the order of the Learned

Magistrate on facts, when the analysis of the facts by the Learned Magistrate

was not perverse?

2. Did the High Court err in law by failing to consider that the Respondent (the

Applicant) had failed to adhere to new grounds for claiming maintenance

after the dismissal of an earlier application for maintenance bearing No. M-

3938?

3. Did the High Court err in law in failing to consider the capacity of the

Respondent (the Applicant) to earn her living and the Petitioners means?

(The emphasis is mine.)

In answering the questions, which this court is called upon to do, consideration of

Sections 2 of the Maintenance Act (hereinafter also referred to as the Act) would

be necessary. Section 2 (1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1990 reads as

follows:-

5

Where any person having sufficient means, neglects or unreasonably refuses to

maintain such persons spouse who is unable to maintain himself or herself, the

Magistrate may, upon an application being made for maintenance, and upon proof

of such neglect or unreasonable refusal order such person to make a monthly

allowance for the maintenance of such spouse at such monthly rate as the

Magistrate thinks fit having regard to the income of such person and the means

and circumstances of such spouse. Provided, however, that no such order shall be

made if the applicant, spouse is living in adultery or both the spouses are living

separately by mutual consent.

Hence, by the operation of the proviso to section 2 (1), even in instances where an

Applicant had established that the spouse is unable to maintain herself or himself,

the Applicant would not be entitled to a favourable order of maintenance, if;

(a) the Applicant was living in adultery;

or

(b) the Applicant and the Respondent were living separately by mutual

consent;

In terms of the provisions of the Act, in every application made for maintenance,

there is a primary duty cast on the Magistrate to address his or her mind to the

statutory disqualifications referred to above before making an order either in

granting or refusing maintenance. Whilst in relation to (a) above, the

Respondent may have to adduce material to satisfy the court that the spouse (the

applicant) is living in adultery, in relation to (b), however, the policy of the

Maintenance Act demands that the Magistrate plays a pro- active role rather than

a passive one in arriving at his decision.

The first question of law on which leave was granted is, whether the High Court

erred in law by reversing the order of the Learned Magistrate on facts, where, it

was contended that, the analysis of the facts by the Learned Magistrate cannot be

said perverse.

6

The Magistrate in refusing the application of the Applicant for maintenance, had

observed that the Applicant has not submitted any evidence to substantiate the

allegation that the Respondent- Appellant had either ill-treated her or he

committed adultery. b,a,qusldrsh ish b,a,qus m;%fhka j.W;a;rlre lDDr iy.;

lreKq 2 isnkaOfhka lsis idlaIshla bosrsm;a lr fkdue; The Magistrate has

further observed that the Applicant is living separately from the Respondent-

Appellant due to a minor disagreement over where they should reside. Therefore,

the Magistrate has concluded that she has been living separately since 2003 for

reasons not revealed to the Court and that the Respondent-Appellant has not

refused or neglected to pay the maintenance ordered under case No. M-3938 (in

respect of the child).

The Magistrate made a fundamental error when she concluded that the Applicant

had not placed any evidence on the aspect of ill treatment or adultery, the

main reasons the Applicant had asserted, for living separately. The learned

Magistrate had overlooked the fact that the Applicant had filed an affidavit along

with the Petition in compliance with Section 11 of the Act and it is trite law that

the contents sworn to, in an affidavit, is evidence.

In terms of Section 11 of the Act, the Magistrate is required to issue summons on

the person against whom the Application is made, only in instances where the

Magistrate is satisfied that the facts set out in the affidavit are sufficient. In the

instant case, the Magistrate having considered the affidavit of the Applicant, had

thought it fit to issue summons on the Respondent-Appellant.

In terms of Section 11, once summons is issued, the burden shifts to the person

against whom the Application is made, to appear and show cause.

The procedure that should be adopted by the Magistrate when deciding to issue

summons, is succinctly elaborated by Justice R.B. Ranarjah in an article, under the

7

title Maintenance. His Lordship states that, The procedure a Magistrate should

follow upon the Defendant (Respondent) appearing on summons is, when he

admits marriage to the Applicant, to inquire from him whether he is inviting the

Applicant to live with him on his undertaking to maintain her. Where the

Defendant (Respondent) offers to do so, the Magistrate should then inquire from

the Applicant whether she is prepared to accept the Defendants offer. If the reply

is in the affirmative, the court should do whatever possible for a successful

reconciliation. Where the Applicant refuses to accept the offer of the husband, the

Magistrate on the evidence placed before the court, consider the reasons for the

refusal given by her.

In the instant case no such offer did forth come from the Respondent- Appellant.

In paragraph 7 of the affidavit of the Applicant, she had sworn to the effect that:

Due to acts of cruelty and illicit love affair on the part of the Respondent- I live

separately. Hence it would be reasonable to conclude that, when it was decided

to issue summons on the Appellant Respondent, the said decision was taken only

upon the magistrate having formed the view, that the facts set out in the affidavit

of the Applicant were sufficient to have a summons issued.

In terms of the Proviso to Section 2 of the Act, the Magistrate only needs to be

satisfied that the Applicant and the Respondent-Appellant was not living separately

by mutual consent. The old Maintenance Ordinance, which was repealed when

the new Act came into operation in 1999, however, carried an additional

disqualification in instances where the applicant (wife) without sufficient reasons

refuses to live with her husband. One of the grounds for the magistrate to reject

the application for maintenance was that the Applicant was living separately due

to minor disagreements over the house they were living in. Under the provisions

of the Act, the nature or the gravity of the disagreement for living separately is

immaterial as the disqualification for maintenance under Section 2 (1) of the Act

has to stem only from a separation that is mutual.

8

The Respondent-Appellant had given evidence under oath at the Inquiry but had

not refuted the assertion referred to in paragraph 7 of the Applicants affidavit

referred to above, nor has he, in the course of his testimony, challenged the

assertions made by the Applicant and as such, the said assertions made by the

Applicant remain unassailed. Furthermore, under cross examination, the

Applicant had stated that she was engaged in business prior to her marriage and

that she transferred the business to the Appellant Respondent. After the business

was transferred, the Appellant Respondent did not allow her to attend to any

matters relating to the business.

As observed earlier as well, when considering the scheme of granting maintenance

in terms of the provisions of the Act, other than the two instances referred to in the

Act where if the spouse is disqualified from obtaining maintenance, the Magistrate

is vested with wide discretion in granting maintenance to a spouse.

The Magistrates, however, should exercise caution in drawing inferences and

should avoid doing so, in the absence of any material to arrive at conclusions. In

the instant case, the learned Magistrate in her order has also misdirected herself

by holding that, the Applicant could have engaged in some employment by leaving

the child with her mother. However, no evidence had been led at the inquiry with

regard to the capacity of the Applicants mother to look after the child. The age of

the Applicants mother, her condition of health, her willingness to take the

additional responsibility to look after a young girl are matters the court ought to

have considered before drawing such an inference. Bereft of any such material, I

do not think the Magistrate was justified in drawing the inference that the child

could have been entrusted to the Applicants mother, to be looked after. The High

Court Judge has correctly observed that the Magistrate has also erred in stating

that the Applicants mother or her sisters could take care of the child while the

Applicant engages in some form of employment.

9

Another matter that ought to have been considered was, the fact that the Applicant

is a single parent who was encumbered with the duties of a father as well as those

of a mother in bringing up a young girl.

The fact that both the Applicant and the child were suffering from illnesses had

been conceded by the Respondent-Appellant. Given her ill health and the necessity

of looking after the child after school and attending to matters that are ancillary to

her education in the best interests of the child, the High Court has decided that the

Applicant is unable to engage in full-time employment and therefore the

Respondent-Appellant is liable under the provisions of the Act to pay maintenance.

The learned Magistrate had failed to consider any of these matters before refusing

the Application of the Applicant for maintenance and I am of the view that the

learned High Court judge was justified in reversing the order of the learned

Magistrate and the order of the learned High Court Judge cannot be considered as

perverse.

The second question of law that the Court is called upon to answer is whether,

after the dismissal of the earlier application for maintenance No. M-3938, the

Applicant could have maintained the present action without adducing evidence

with regard to change of circumstances. It was contended on behalf of the

Respondent-Appellant that the Applicant withdrew the earlier application for

maintenance on her behalf (Case No. M3938) and that the Applicant pleaded

similar grounds as in Case No. M3938 in her subsequent maintenance application,

which is germane to the case before us.

With regard to an application for maintenance, the prerogative is with the spouse

in deciding as to whether the spouse wishes to avail herself of the provisions of the

Act to obtain maintenance. It must be noted that the Applicant, initially having

asked for an order for maintenance for the child as well as for herself, did not

10

pursue the application for maintenance on her behalf in Case No. M3938 when

the Respondent-Appellant agreed to pay maintenance for their child.

Thus, the issue is, in view of the withdrawal of the initial application for

maintenance, whether the Applicant could have filed a fresh application

subsequently. It was contended on behalf of the Respondent-Appellant that a fresh

application can only be permitted if new grounds are averred. Although the

learned Counsel for the Appellant-Respondent relied on the provision embodied in

Section 8, the provisions of the Act, however, do not stipulate such a restriction. In

terms of the said provision (Section 8), the Magistrate is empowered to make an

alteration in the allowance already ordered, upon proof of a change in the

circumstances.

As held in the case of Anna Perera v Emaliano Nonis and Justina v Arman 12 NLR

263, the policy of the then Maintenance Ordinance was that applications for

maintenance should not be disposed of otherwise than upon adjudication on the

merits. As referred to earlier, M-3938 was disposed of without adjudicating on the

merits. On the other hand, it is the prerogative of the applicant to decide as to

whether maintenance should be asked for and if so when.

The learned counsel for the Respondent- Appellant drew the attention of the Court

to Section 8 of the Maintenance Act which states that; On the application of any

person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under the provisions of

this Act and on proof of a change in the circumstances of any person for whose

benefit or against whom an order for maintenance has been made under this Act,

the Magistrate may either cancel such order or make such alteration in the

allowance ordered as he deems fit: Provided that such cancellation or alteration

shall take effect from the date on which the application for cancellation or

alteration was made to such Court, unless the Magistrate for good reasons to be

recorded, orders otherwise. Accordingly, it was argued that the burden of

establishing new and changed circumstances, is on the Applicant.

11

The Respondent- Appellants contention that where a change of circumstances has

not been adduced, the Applicant is barred from obtaining maintenance by a fresh

application on the principle of res judicata, in our view, is not the correct position

of the law in relation to application for maintenance.

This position was elaborated in the case of Ranjith v Piyaseeli (2006) 2 SLR 325)

The Court held;

Provisions of Sections 34, 207 and 406 of the Civil Procedure Code, which

embody the principles of Res Judicata will not apply to maintenance

proceedings.

The Maintenance Act does not contemplate decrees. It deals with orders.

Therefore, an order made under the Maintenance Act is not a decree that

comes under the expression all "decrees" in section 207. Unlike in section

188 of the Code, the Maintenance Act does not provide that after the

judgment is pronounced, a decree be drawn up by the court.

In application M-3938, the Applicant has not referred to any expenses she had to

incur for medication and has stated that she is living with her child at her parents

house. However, the Magistrate has observed that in application M-5240 (marked

P1) she has stated that she is incurring more than Rs. 4,500/- as medical expenses

for herself and is currently living in a rented house (at Paragraph 8 of P1), thereby

indicating a change of circumstances. Considering the above, this Court is of the

view that the second question on which leave was granted also should be answered

in the negative.

In any event Section 8 of the Maintenance Act has no application here as it can

only be invoked by any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance

under the provisions of this Act. The applicant was not a person receiving a

monthly allowance as referred to in the provision of the Law.

12

The final question is whether the High Court erred in law in failing to consider the

capacity of the Applicant to earn her living and the sufficient means of the

Respondent-Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent-Appellant drew the attention of this court

to the principles laid down in the case of Fonseka v Candappa 1988 2 SLLR 11.It

has been held that It becomes a question of law, where the relevant evidence

bearing on a fact has not been considered or irrelevant matters have been given

undue importance or the conclusions rest mainly on erroneous considerations or

is not supported by sufficient evidence.

This court is also mindful of the decision in the case of Collettes Limited v Bank of

Ceylon 1984 2 SLLR 253 where the special circumstances when a higher Court

has the jurisdiction to revise the findings of fact of a lower Court were recognized.

It was observed that ordinarily, with regard to a finding of a lower Court, a higher

Court will not interfere with findings of fact based upon relevant evidence

except in special circumstances, such as, for instance, where the judgment of the

lower court shows that the relevant evidence bearing on a fact has not been

considered or irrelevant matters have been given undue importance or that the

conclusion rests mainly on erroneous considerations or is not supported by

sufficient evidence. When the judgment of the lower court exhibits such

shortcomings, this court not only may, but is under a duty to examine the

supporting evidence and reverse the findings.

Bearing in mind the principles laid down in the cases referred to above, I now

proceed to consider whether the High Court erred in law in the considerations it

made regarding the Applicants capacity to earn a living and the Respondent-

Appellants means.

The High Court has observed that although the Respondent-Appellant, has

conceded that he is earning an income of Rs. 50,000/-. (Page 17 of the proceedings

of 08 March 2010 before the Magistrate) he had subsequently (on 07 June 2010)

13

stated that he has lost employment due to Tandon Lanka Pvt. Ltd. where he was

employed being closed down. The learned Magistrate had been of the opinion that

even though he has lost his employment, as a mechanical engineer he would have

no difficulty finding new employment. In fact, he had admitted in evidence, that

he has the potential to find work. According to his evidence, he had been involved

in developing memory chips for computers. It is common knowledge that there is

a great demand for experts in the field of Information Technology (IT) in Sri Lanka,

and the learned Magistrate, in my view, was justified in drawing such an inference

in terms of Section 112 of the Evidence Ordinance. The Applicant in her evidence

had stated that the Respondent-Appellant does private work during his free time

in repairing computers and makes an income of about Rs. 100,000/- a month.

The Respondent-Appellant, however, has denied that he earns such an income.

A reading of Section 2 (1) shows that the Act contemplates the payment of

maintenance by a spouse who has sufficient means. It is sufficient that if the

Respondent spouse has some mode of income or has funds at his disposal to pay

maintenance to the Applicant spouse, without having to forgo funds necessary for

his expenses. Going by the evidence placed at the inquiry, if the Applicant is to be

believed, the Respondent-Appellant had been earning a considerable sum through

computer repairs and it appears that he is in a position to pay the sum of Rs.

20,000/- ordered by the High Court, and still be left with sufficient means to

provide for himself at the same time. It is also pertinent to note that even though

the Respondent-Appellant had stated that he lost employment, he has not made

any application declaring a difficulty to pay maintenance for the child, which he

could have done in terms of Section 8 of the Act, if he had lost his income.

On whom does the burden of proof lie, regarding the sufficient means of the

Respondent spouse, is another relevant consideration when answering the third

question of law. I wish to cite with approval, the observation made in relation to

Section 11 of the Act in the case of Ruhunuge Sirisena v Hewa Kankanamage

14

Pushpa Rajani SC Appeal No 117/2010 SC Minutes, 08. 05. 2013 Their Lordships

held that Section 11 of the Maintenance Act places the burden of proof on the

Respondent to show cause why the application should not be granted. In other

words the burden of proof of showing that the Respondent does not have sufficient

means is on the Respondent.

In the instant case, refusal by the Magistrate to grant maintenance to the Applicant

was not because the Respondent-Appellant had no capacity to pay, but on the basis

that the Applicant is a healthy person who had the capacity and possessed the

requisite experience to engage in a business and therefore not a person who is

unable to maintain herself in terms of the Act.

The learned Magistrate in fact had rejected the assertion of the Respondent-

Appellant that he was not employed. j. W;a;rlre bxcsfkare Wmdhla ,ndf.k

fkdlrkafkah hkqfjka lrkq ,nk ;lh ms<s.; fkdyel. (Page 8 of the Order)

Therefore, even though the High Court has not referred to the loss of employment

of the Respondent-Appellant nor his income through computer repairs, upon

considering the evidence adduced regarding the financial situation of the

Respondent-Appellant, I see no reason to alter the order to pay Rs. 20,000/- made

by the High Court. It is to be noted that both the Applicant and the child were living

in rented premises at a monthly rent of Rs.10, 000/-. It is also to be noted that not

only the Applicant, but the child also needs decent living space for herself as well.

The learned High Court Judge had weighed a number of facts admitted in evidence

in deciding whether the Applicant had the capacity to earn a living. The Applicant

being compelled to stay with the child and having to attend to her various needs,

primarily her educational pursuits and matters attendant to it, were held as

justifiable reasons for the Applicants inability to engage in any employment.

Therefore, there was no failure on the part of the learned High Court Judge to

consider the Applicants capacity to earn an income or to be gainfully employed.

15

In view of the above, the Court is of the view that the third question on which leave

was granted also should be answered in the negative.

Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed.
