COUNSEL : Athula Perera with Vindya Divulwewa for the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant.

Mrs. K. Sivapathasundaram with Daya Guruge for the

Defendant-Appellant-Respondent.

ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 27.02.2019.

SISIRA J. DE ABREW, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. This is an appeal

against the judgment of the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

dated 12.11.2015 wherein, they set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge dated 07.10.2010. Learned District Judge by the said judgment held

the case in favour of the Plaintiff. Learned High Court Judges however, by the

said judgment set aside the judgment of the District Judge. When we read the

judgment it appears that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

have set aside the judgment of the District Judge on the basis that the corpus

had not been properly identified. Mr. Athula Perera who appears for the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant too submits that the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court have set aside the judgment on the basis that the corpus

had not been properly identified.

Mrs. Sivapathasundaram who appears for the Defendant-Appellant-

Respondent too admits this position. Therefore, the most important question

that must be decided is whether the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court were correct when they set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge. The Defendant-Appellant-Respondent ( hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant-Respondent) at the trial has raised issues of prescription relating to

the disputed land. The disputed land is shown as Lot 3 in Plan No.10164

dated 22.04.2008. This Plan was prepared on a commission issued by the

learned District Judge. The most important question that should be

considered is whether the Defendant-Respondent is entitled to raise the point

that the corpus had not been identified when the Defendant-Respondent has

claimed prescriptive title to the corpus. In my view, when the Defendant-

Respondent claims the disputed land (the corpus) on the basis of prescription,

he is not entitled to raise the question of non- identification of the disputed

land (the corpus) because when he raises the plea of prescription, he has

impliedly admitted the identification of corpus. Therefore, the question that the

corpus had not been properly identified cannot be raised in this appeal.

Unfortunately, learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have set aside

the judgment of the learned District Judge on the basis that the corpus had

not been properly identified. As I pointed out earlier the Defendant-

Respondent has impliedly admitted that he has identified the corpus. When we

consider all the above matters we are unable to permit the judgment of the

Civil Appellate High Court to stand. Further, we note that the Defendant has

not disputed the identification of corpus in the District Court. This Court by

its order dated 27.10.2016 has granted leave to appeal on questions of law set

out in paragraph 22(a)(b)(c)(d) and (e) of the Petition of Appeal dated

18.12.2015 which are set out below,

(a) In the circumstances of the case, has the defendant disputed the

identification of the corpus, in that whether lot 3 in plan 10164 dated

06.06.2008 is the portion of land encroached by the defendant from the

land described in the 1st schedule to the amended plaint?

(b) Are lots 1, 2, 3 in plan 10164 dated 06.06.2008 form the subject matter

of this case?

(c ) Is the plan 10164 dated 06.06.2008 a valid plan, in that has the

Commissioner of Surveyor had prepared the said plan according to

available information?

(d) In the circumstances pleaded is the judgment of the High Court

according to law and according to the evidence adduced in the case?

(e ) In the circumstances pleaded is judgment of the District Court according

to law and according to evidence adduced in the case?

For the above reasons, we answer the question No.1 as follows.

The Defendant has not disputed the identification of the corpus. When we

answer the question No.1, we hold that the question No.2 & 3 do not arise for

consideration.

We answer question No.4 as follows,

The judgment of the High Court is not according to the law.

We answer question No.5 in the affirmative.

For the above reasons, we set aside the judgment of the learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court dated 12.11.2015 and affirm the judgment of the

learned District Judge.
