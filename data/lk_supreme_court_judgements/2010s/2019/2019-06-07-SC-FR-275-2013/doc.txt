BEFORE : L.T.B. DEHIDENIYA, J.,

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J. AND

E.A.G.R. AMARASEKARA, J.

COUNSEL : Rajeev Amarasuriya with Ms. Anne Devananda for Petitioner.

Rajiv Goonetilleke, SSC for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 6th February 2019.

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS : Petitioner- 14th January 2019.

Respondents- 13th March 2019.

DECIDED ON : 7th June 2019.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

This is a Fundamental Rights application filed by the Petitioner above named,

complaining that he has been discriminated for the appointment of Assistant

Superintendent of Police (ASP) on the basis of his marriage under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

As per the available material before this Court, the Appellant had applied for the post

of ASP (Ordinary Police Office category). He was successful in the 1st written test and

SC FR Application 275/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

the 2nd interview. Before the final interview and the appointment, he had contracted

his marriage. The appointing authority had disqualified him on the basis of married

persons are not eligible to be appointed as ASP (Ordinary Police Service Category).

The petitioner had submitted two principal matters to be determined by the Court.

(a) Whether discriminating the Petitioner because he “married” at the age of 34

years and therefore denying him appointment to the rank of ASP (which he

was duly selected for)(on this basis alone), is unconstitutional and in violation

of inter-alia the equality and equal protection provision of the Constitution.

(b) In any event, whether there was a prohibition at all, for married persons to be

denied appointment.

The Petitioner advances his argument on the basis of International Covenant for Civil

and Political Rights (ICCPR), Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), our

Constitution and General Marriages Ordinance. Further the Petitioner is relying on

judgments of other jurisdictions namely USA and Nigeria.

Cases cited by the Petitioner are not directly relevant to the issue before us. Further it

is observed that, said judgments are in jurisdictions which are completely different

from the social, economical, welfare and disciplinary services in Sri Lanka. Here, we

basically followed the discipline in the military services from British with more

specialization in domestic values. Hence, the order of discipline in uniformed services

cannot be easily compared with other jurisdictions.

Respondents, represented by the Attorney General, submit that, the classification is

based on rational and disciplinary matters of uniformed service. Further they submit

that, the classification is warranted for the better training and service of the Police

Officers.

SC FR Application 275/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution assures to all citizens, Freedom to engage by

himself or in association with others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade,

business or enterprise.

The Petitioner had applied for the post of ASP under the Ordinary Police Service

category and he had for the 1st interview obtained required marks to call for the 2nd

interview. He attended the 2nd interview and he was successful. He was listed in the

final selection list. Before the appointment is given, the Petitioner had contracted his

marriage. When he submitted his marriage certificate for authorities, had found him

disqualified for selection.

Now the Petitioner complains that marriage is his fundamental right and

disqualifying him is amount to be a discrimination which tantamount to violation of

fundamental rights enshrined under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The

Respondents submits that, the Petitioner had applied on an advertisement published

in Gazette No. 1664 dated 23/07/2010. According to the said gazette, the Open

Competitive Examination for the Selections of Assistant Superintendent of Police was

called under several categories.

2.1 describe the Ordinary Police Service. Among many, one of the requirements is be

an unmarried person. In the meantime 2.2 ASP (Medical Officer) which says may be

married or unmarried. Similarly 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10 which are for ASP

(Information Technology), ASP (Civil Engineer), ASP (Architecture), ASP (Electrical

Engineer), ASP (Mechanical Engineer), ASP (Electronic Engineer), ASP (Veterinary

Medicine), ASP (Western Music) respectively. Except the Ordinary Police Service

Category at 2.1 other positions are more technical and specialised in certain field of

work. Further it is observed that, those are open to female candidates too.

SC FR Application 275/2013 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

State Counsel submits that, this classification is for a specific purpose which is

permitted under the Constitution. As submitted by the State, Assistant

Superintendent of Police who is selected under the ‘Ordinary Police Service category’

is in-charge of the law and order, which obviously needs strenuous physical and

weapon training. That is the reason why the appointing authorities had specified

that, these candidates should be unmarried with less or no family commitment for

the purpose of training.

In Perera vs Jayawickrema [1985 1 Sri LR 285], Sharvananda CJ, delivered the

majority opinion of the Court. The Hon. Chief Justice stated that a person claiming to

be discriminated against must show that there was at least one other person similarly

situate or equally circumstanced; that he had been treated differently from others

and that there was no reasonable basis for such differential treatment.

The Petitioner brings an argument that, the word “candidate” will not be applicable

for the Petitioner, because he is already been selected, hence he can marry. The

requirement of unmarried is for the purpose of training after the appointment.

Therefore this requirement is applicable until the conclusion of selection, training and

the probation period or until the period specified by the appointing authority.

The State refers to AIR India v. Meerza [1981 Vol 1 pp 438-503 also reported as

1981 AIR SC 1829] held that,

“Based on reasonable classification that requiring air hostesses to be unmarried

for period of four years after getting employment was not a violation of the

equality provision, however that requiring them to leave employment after

having children was against the equality provision.”

It is noteworthy that the Article 14 of the Indian Constitution which grants the right

to equality is similar to Article 12(1) of the Sri Lankan Constitution. Article 14 of the

SC FR Application 275/2013 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

Indian Constitution reads; “the State shall not deny to any person equality before the

law or the equal protection of the law in the territory of India..”

It is also to be noted that, based on this similarity between Article 14 of the

Constitution, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka had referred to Indian case law to elicit

the meaning of equality as it did in Perera vs. UGC [1978-80 1 SLR 103,

Seneviratne vs. UGC [1978-80 1 SLR 182, Ramupillai vs. Festus Perera [1991 1

SLR 11] and many other cases over the years.

Considering all, we find that the classification is reasonable in the given

circumstances. Hence, we find that, there is no violation of the fundamental rights of

the Petitioner.

Accordingly, we dismiss the Application.

Application dismissed.
