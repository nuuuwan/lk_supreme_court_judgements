The judicial dicta referred to earlier clearly states that dominium to the land should be established by the plaintiff on his own accord and not on the weaknesses of the defence. Similarly, consequential rights flowing from dominium to a property, should also be established by the plaintiff on a balance of probability. The burden is clearly on the plaintiff to prove it\u2019s case. The weaknesses and the inability of the defendant to prove it\u2019s claim is immaterial and has no bearing.

The plaint only indicates that the defendant unlawfully filled a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s land. The evidence led, especially the proceedings in the Section 66 application indicate that the plaintiff has blocked the road way and the water course in December 1995 and the Primary Court restored the possession to the defendant in September 1996. The plaint upon which this appeal lies has been filed in May 2000, four and a half years after the said Section 66 order and does not indicate the date upon which the plaintiff was dispossessed from the land. Was it the date of the Section 66 notice or some other date? The plaintiff has also not prayed for ejectment of the defendant. The record further bears out that in 2001, whilst the District Court case was pending once again the Primary Court has made order to restore the possession of the defendant, as the plaintiff has blocked the water course and impeded cultivation of the defendant\u2019s fields. Hence, it is observed that the nondisclosure of the date of dispossession of the plaintiff is a material omission. More over the statement that the date is not relevant in a rei vidicatio action is a clear misdirection by the District Court. In the said circumstances, we hold that the District Court has failed to appreciate the ingredients and the burden of proof in a rei vindicatio action. Thus, the High Court correctly",
