S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Accused-Appellant, Ranathunga Arachchige Ranjith Chandrathilaka

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as Appellant) was indicted at the High Court of

Colombo on three counts namely, Section 367 of the Penal Code to be read with

Section 3 of the Offences against Public Property Act and Section 395 of the Penal

Code.

The indictment was read and explained to the Appellant and he pleaded not

guilty. When the trial commenced, the prosecution led the evidence of Mayadunna

Mudiyanselage Chandrasiri Mayadunna, Walimuli Nishantha Amaranath,

Hettiarachchige Sampath Sri Lal Harischandra, Sabhadevan Parameswaran, Inspector

of Police Aththaragama, Sub-Inspector of Police Premanath and closed the case.

Being convinced of a prima facie case being established, the trial court called the

defence. The Appellant opted to make a statement from the dock.

Upon hearing the submissions of both counsel, the learned High Court Judge

delivered the order and found the Appellant not guilty on the 1st and 2nd counts

and found guilty on the 3rd count. Both the prosecuting and defence counsel were

invited to make submissions before sentencing the Appellant and the learned trial

judge, after giving reasons, imposed 5 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

50 000/- in default 4 year’s rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal after

giving reasons.

Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the

appellant preferred an appeal to this Court. On the 24th of July 2019, after the

learned Counsel made submissions in support of his appeal, this Court granted leave

on the following question of law.

(i) Whether the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is excessive?

DRAFT

SC Appeal No. 134/2019 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 5

Heard the submissions of both counsel and considered the written

submissions filed by both parties. The Counsel for the Appellant submitted the

following factors to be considered in favour of the Appellant.

a) The Appellant is a first offender

b) Married and has school going children

c) Sole breadwinner

The Appellant is not challenging the conviction and submissions were made

regarding the quantum of the sentence only. The Senior State Counsel submitted to

Court that the conviction is well-founded and that in the given circumstances,

sentence is reasonable.

I carefully perused the proceedings before the original court – namely the

High Court. Considering the evidence before the Court and the reasons stated by the

learned judge, I find that the conviction is well-founded. Therefore I am not inclined

to interfere with the said conviction.

Regarding the sentence, the learned trial judge before passing the sentence

had invited both Counsel to make their submissions. The Appellant had submitted

the same submissions before the learned trial judge. After considering their

submissions, the learned High Court judge had imposed the sentence stated above.

Considering the submissions, I find that the Appellant was an employee

attached to the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation as a technical officer and he was

found guilty on selling copper transmission cables that probably belonged to the

said Corporation, to a scrap metal dealer. The said vendor gave evidence to the fact

that he had dealt with the Appellant on several occasions with regard to similar

cables.

I have observed that when those who work in government institutions are

found guilty on criminal offences, they plead ‘first offender’ as a mitigating factor. It

is obvious that a person in government service cannot be a convicted criminal.

DRAFT

SC Appeal No. 134/2019 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 5

Therefore, a plea of ‘first offender’ should not be acceptable. It is the duty of

government employees to protect their institutions. Acts causing loss to state

property especially at their institution cannot be pardoned or condoned.

In view of the fact that the offence of habitually dealing with stolen items

punished under Article 395 of the Penal Code carries a maximum punishment of 20

years Rigorous Imprisonment, I find the imposition of 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment

by the learned trial judge to be reasonable. The reasons of the learned trial judge

were expressed after hearing the evidence of all witnesses before him. Further he is

the best judge to evaluate the deposition and demeanour of all witnesses and the

Accused. In this case, I have no reason to interfere with the sentence.

Considering all of the above, I answer the question of law in the negative.

Appeal dismissed.
