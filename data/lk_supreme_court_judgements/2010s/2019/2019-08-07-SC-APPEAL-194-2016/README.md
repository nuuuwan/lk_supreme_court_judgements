S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

This is an Appeal filed by K. Mahendran i.e. the Applicant-Respondent-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Employee-Appellant’) against the Respondent-

Appellant-Respondent i.e. Deutsche Welle Radio and TV (hereinafter referred to as

the ‘Employer-Respondent’).

The Employee-Appellant was employed as a Transmitter Mechanic in 1985 by the

Employer-Respondent. Upon reaching fifty five years of age, the Employee-Appellant

retired from service on 2nd November 2011. The Employee-Appellant was re-

employed on the basis of two consecutive fixed term employment contracts, each for

six months, with the period of the first contract being from 01.11.2010 to 30.04.2011

and the second contract being from 01.05.2011 to 31.10.2011. During the period of

the second contract, the Employee-Appellant was informed by the Employer-

Respondent that, he is to be suspended from 31st August 2011 till the 31st of October

SC/ APPEAL/ 194/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 8

2011 due to his conduct inside the workplace. He was further informed that his salary

will be paid and that his services will not be required after October 2011.

On 23.04.2012, the Employee-Appellant filed an Application bearing No.

LT/TC/121/12 in the Labour Tribunal of Trincomalee on the grounds of unjust and

wrongful termination of his service. Further, he pleaded that he be re-instated in

service and be paid with his gratuity and additional bonus.

The learned President of Labour Tribunal, after hearing the parties ruled in favor of

the Employee-Appellant by order dated 18.12.2013. The President of the Labour

Tribunal came to a conclusion that his termination was unfair and that, he be paid

compensation equivalent to forty four months’ salary, which was totaled to Rs. 1,452,

000/-

Being aggrieved with the said order, the Employer-Respondent filed an Appeal to the

Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province by Petition of Appeal dated 22.01.2014.

The learned Judge of the High Court, after giving reasons, by order dated 10.12.2015

allowed the Appeal and set aside the order of the President of the Labour Tribunal.

Being unsatisfied with the said order, the Employee-Appellant preferred the present

Appeal to this Court. When the matter was supported for notice on 24.10.2016, leave

was granted on the following questions marked (a) and (e) in paragraph 8 of the

Petition dated 21.01.2016-

“a) Did the Learned Judge of the High Court of the Eastern Province

err in law in coming to the finding that the Petitioner’s application to

the Labour Tribunal was out of time?

e) Was the judgment of the High Court of the Eastern Province ‘just

and equitable’?”

It will be appropriate to consider certain factual matters before we proceed to answer

the questions in this Appeal. The Employee-Appellant was employed on 16.05.1985

SC/ APPEAL/ 194/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 8

and had retired on 02.11.2010 as per the retirement policy of the Company.

Thereafter, he had claimed his Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Employee Trust Fund

(ETF) and Gratuity on 10.01.2002. All those claims have been duly paid.

After the retirement, he had filed an application for the post of Transmitter Mechanic

(marked as ‘R2’ on Page 202) and the Employer-Respondent employed the

Employee-Appellant on a contract basis and the salary was decided as Rs. 837 per

day and can be increased up to Rs. 921 from 10.12.2010. (marked as ‘R3’ on Page

203).

On perusing the file, we find that the first employment is evidently distinct from the

second and third employments. Further, it is observed that the employment

relationship which began in 1985 between the employer and the employee, had

come to an end on 02.11.2010 when the employee reached the age of fifty five years.

On retirement, all the benefits were settled. Therefore, the contracts that resulted in

the second and third employment with the same parties is not a continuation of the

initial employment but, is rather, a new relationship on a contract basis. When the

second term of contract was in force, it appears that the employee was involved in an

act of misconduct with another employee, which had gone up to the Police Station

and the matter was pending before the authorities at the relevant time.

The period of 2nd Contract was from 1/5/2011 to 31/10/2011. The Employer-

Respondent had suspended and terminated the second contract with effect from

31.10.2011. For the purpose of completeness, the Employer-Respondent and Sri

Lanka Broadcasting Corporation had a contract. Since the time period of the said

contract was complete, the Employer-Respondent decided to close down the

workplace. After having obtaining approval from the Commissioner of Labour, the

Employer-Respondent provided compensation to its employees. The people who

were on service on the relevant date i.e. on 31.12.2011 were paid compensation on

the basis of amounts approved by the Commissioner of Labour.

SC/ APPEAL/ 194/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 8

The Counsel for the Employee-Appellant submits that there has been a

discrimination since the co-employees were paid compensation while the Employee-

Appellant was not paid any such compensation. He submits the following authorities

to support his claim that the order of the President of the Labour Tribunal is

acceptable- United Engineering Worker Union v. K. W. Devanayagam, 69 N.L.R.

289 and Y. G. De Silva v. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., 1978-

79/2/SLR/12. Further, he submits that the Employee-Appellant was unfairly treated.

The Counsel for the Employer-Respondent submits to the Court that the Employee-

Appellant was not in service on the due date and that therefore, he is not entitled to

any compensation. Further, he submits that the Employee-Appellant was inconsistent

in his Application to Courts. Elaborating on the same, he states that the Employee-

Appellant submitted an Application to the President of the Labour Tribunal and when

it was taken up for hearing, he had changed the texture and nature of the

Application. He also submits that the Application was time barred.

On carefully perusing all the documents and proceedings available in our brief, I find

that, the Employee-Appellant, in his original Application dated 23.04.2012 had

sought re-employment, gratuity and additional bonus but when the matter was

taken up for inquiry, he submitted that others were paid compensation and other

benefits and that therefore, he should be paid compensation as well.

I find that, the termination of the employment services of the other employees was

with effect from 31.12.2011 as per contract while the Employee-Appellant’s services

were terminated with effect from 31.10.2011. Therefore, it is clear that he was not

employed on the date of closure of the Company i.e. on 31.12.2011. Hence, he is not

entitled to be paid compensation. Moreover, I observe that, the Employee Provident

Fund, the Employee Trust Fund and Gratuity claimed by the Employee-Appellant has

been duly paid.

In the case of Caledonian Estates Ltd. v. Hillman, S.C. 250/72—L.T. 1/27665, it

was observed that-

SC/ APPEAL/ 194/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 8

“The question that the Tribunal has to address itself is … whether the

employee has, in the circumstances of the termination, a claim, in

justice and equity, to compensation or other benefit for the loss of

career resulting from the termination. If the employee’s conduct had

induced the termination, he cannot, in justice and equity, have a just

claim to compensation for loss of career, as he has only to blame

himself for the predicament in which he finds himself.”

Moreover, in the case of Ceylon Transport Board v. Wijeratne, (77 N.L.R. 481) at

page 489, it was observed that-

‘It has been repeatedly held that no compensation can be ordered

where the dismissal is justified.”

In the case of Superintendent, Dalma Group v. Ceylon Estate Staff’s Union, 73

N.L.R. 574, it was held-

“Compensation is payable only when a wrong has been done”

In the present case, it is evident that the employee’s misconduct had induced the

suspension of the second contract and therefore, he is not entitled to obtain

compensation in this regard.

Considering the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, I am of the

view that, the President of the Labour Tribunal had failed in assessing the approval

by the Commissioner of Labour and the mode of termination of employment of the

then employees of the Company. At the time of filing the Application dated

23.04.2012 before the President of the Labour Tribunal, the Employee-Appellant was

fully aware of the closure of the Company. Even in that background, the Employee-

Appellant had sought re-employment and other benefits but not compensation.

Further, with regard to the date of termination and the date of filing the Application,

the learned High Court Judge had found that the Employee-Appellant was time

SC/ APPEAL/ 194/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 8

barred. On having carefully perused the record, I find that, the learned High Court

Judge is justified in his decision.

Considering the questions in paragraph 8 of the Petition dated 21.01.2016, for which

leave was granted, I answer the question marked (a) in the negative and

consequently, I answer the question marked (e) in the affirmative.

For the reasons already enumerated by me, I am of the view that, there is no merit in

the Appeal. Accordingly, I dismiss the Appeal and award no cost.

Appeal dismissed.
