The 1st defendant made an application to this Court seeking leave to appeal and was granted leave to appeal on six questions of law which are set out later in this judgment. The parties and the disputed land The plaintiff is the daughter of one W. P. Punnyadasa De Silva [hereinafter referred to as \u201cDe Silva\u201d]. De Silva\u2019s sister was married to one G. P. D. Amarapala De Silva Weerasuriya [hereinafter referred to as \u201cWeerasuriya\u201d]. Thus, De Silva [ie: the plaintiff\u2019s father] and Weerasuriya were brothers-in-law and Weerasuriya\u2019s wife was the plaintiff\u2019s paternal aunt. Weerasuriya had two sons, who are the 1st and 2nd defendants. They are the plaintiff\u2019s cousins. At the times material to this action, De Silva resided and worked in Batticaloa. His daughter, the plaintiff, was born in the year 1957 and resided with him in Batticaloa. She later moved to Kandy in 1981 and has resided in Kandy since then. At the times material to this action, Weerasuriya resided and worked in Kurunegala. His sons, the 1st and 2nd defendants, have also had residences in Kurunegala. Having described the dramatis personae in this appeal - who are all relatives, I should describe the corpus which is the subject matter of this action. It is an allotment of land which is A:0 R:0 P:39 in extent situated in Wilgoda, Kurunegala. Earlier, it was part of an allotment of land depicted as Lot no. 20 in Plan no. 20 dated 24th May 1953 made by S. Gunasekera, Notary Public and containing in extent A:0 R:3 P:35. Lot no. 20 was owned by one E.F. Daniels. It is common ground that, E.F. Daniels executed deed of transfer no. 2883 dated 06th April 1955 transferring Lot no. 20 to one C.S. Jayawickrama, who, from then on, had title to Lot no. 20. Jayawickrama had Lot no. 20 divided into four allotments of land depicted as Lot no. 1, Lot no.2, Lot no.3 and Lot no. 4 in Plan no. 1705 dated 13th November 1958 prepared by J. Vincent Perera, Licensed Surveyor. That Plan no. 1705 was produced at the trial marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. On 16th November 1958, Jayawickrama had these four lots sold by public auction. The plaintiff says that her father [De Silva, who resided in Batticaloa] asked his brother-in-law [Weerasuriya, who resided in Kurunegala] to attend the auction and bid for one of these lots on De Silva\u2019s behalf.",

It is also clear that Weerasuriya acted on behalf of De Silva at the public auction and attended to the formalities of placing a bid on behalf of De Silva and entering into an agreement recording the Conditions of Sale. Further, Weerasuriya has signed \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d to express his acknowledgement of the fact that De Silva obtained title to Lot no. 4 by operation of that instrument. Thus, Weerasuriya\u2019s role was that of an agent acting on behalf of De Silva at the public auction and the subsequent formalities. This deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d was registered at the Kurunegala Land Registry on 15th June 1959. A certified extract of the folio was produced marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 10\u201d by the plaintiff. As set out therein, when \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d was first registered, Weerasuriya\u2019s name has been entered in column three of the folio which states details of the \u201cGrantees (Names in full and residence)\u201d. That has been later corrected by the entry dated 01st September 1995 made by the Registrar of Land in the last column of the same folio, which provides for \u201cREMARKS\u201d. That entry states \u201cThe grantee\u2019s name in column 3 of this entry is corrected by substitution of the words \u2018Warnasuriya Patabendige Punnyadasa de Silva of No: 20 Gnanasuriyan Square, Batticaloa\u2019 in place of the words \u2018Gintota Polwattage Don Amarapala de Silva of C.G.R.Kurunegala\u2019 with Registrar General\u2019s authority after taking action under Section 35 of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.\u201d . It is common ground that, at the same public auction held on 16th November 1958, Weerasuriya also purchased, in his own name, Lot no. 2 and Lot no. 3 depicted in Plan no. 1705 marked \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd22\u201d. The dispute and related facts De Silva transferred Lot no. 4 to his daughter, the plaintiff, by deed of gift no. 1618 dated 01st July 1985 attested by G.P. Patrick, Notary Public of Batticaloa. At that time, the plaintiff would have been 28 years of age. On the face of it, this deed of gift has been executed by De Silva and signed by the plaintiff to signify her acceptance of the donation, before the Notary Public and two witnesses and this Notary Public has attested the deed of gift. Subsequently, this deed of gift has been registered at the Kurunegala Land Registry on 16th August 1985, as set out in the folios marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 10\u201d. The plaintiff produced this deed of gift marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d.

    "text": "that the Notary Public and one of the witnesses had since emigrated and the other witness had since died. An officer of the Batticaloa Land Registry gave evidence and confirmed that the protocol of the deed of gift marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d had been tendered to the Land Registry by the Notary Public. The learned District Judge took the view that the aforesaid evidence was sufficient to prove \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d and the High Court agreed. I see no reason to differ and will proceed on the basis that \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d was proved. About four years after the deed of gift marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d transferring title to Lot no. 4 to the plaintiff was executed and registered at the Land Registry, Weerasuriya has executed a deed of transfer no. 2937 dated 16th May 1989 attested by M.B. Wijekoon, Notary Public. By this deed of transfer no. 2937, Weerasuriya has stated that he possesses and has title to Lot no. 4 and that he is selling and transferring Lot no. 4 to the 1st and 2nd defendants for payment of a consideration of Rs.20,000/-. This deed of transfer no. 2937 was produced by the 1st defendant at the trial, marked \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. It should be mentioned that \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d does not state the manner in which Weerasuriya claims he has title to Lot no. 4. Further, the aforesaid Notary Public who attested \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d has made a specific endorsement thereon that Weerasuriya gave him instructions to dispense with a search at the Land Registry before the deed of transfer was prepared and attested. Thus, at the time of the execution and attestation of this deed of transfer no. 2937 marked \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d on 16th May 1989, the Notary Public could have been unaware of the existence of the previous deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d by which title to Lot no. 4 was transferred to De Silva in 1959 and deed of gift no. 1681 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 3\u201d by which De Silva transferred title to Lot no. 4 to the plaintiff in 1985. A little more than three years later, the 1st defendant filed Partition Case no. 3896/P in the District Court of Kurunegala naming only his brother, the 2nd defendant as a defendant. In his plaint, the 1st defendant pleaded that his father - ie: Weerasuriya - had sole title to Lot no. 4 under and in terms of deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d and that his father had transferred Lot no. 4 to the 1st and 2nd defendants by deed of transfer no.2937 marked \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. On that basis, the 1st defendant prayed that Lot no. 4 should be partitioned between the 1st and 2nd defendants, in equal shares. The Declaration filed in this partition action by the 1st defendant\u2019s Registered Attorney-at-Law under and in terms of section 12 of the Partition Act, declares that he inspected the records at the Land Registry on 09th February 1993 and that he ascertained that there were no other persons who should be included as parties to the partition action. That inspection by the 1st defendant\u2019s Registered Attorney-at-Law could not have failed to reveal that the plaintiff had a claim to Lot no. 4 under and in terms of deed of gift no.",

However, the 1st defendant\u2019s Registered Attorney-at-Law has made a false Declaration and suppressed the fact that the plaintiff had a claim to the corpus of the partition action. The inference is that the Attorney-at-Law did so at the behest of the 1st defendant. It follows that the 1st defendant and his Registered Attorney-at-Law have misled the District Court in Partition Case no. 3896/P and have suppressed the fact that the plaintiff was entitled to be made a party to that action. It should also be mentioned here that the plaintiff resided in Kandy and may have been unaware of any public notice affixed on Lot no. 4 or of a survey of Lot no. 4 by the Court Commissioner. When the trial in this partition action was taken up on 18th May 1994, the 2nd defendant gave evidence stating that he and the 1st defendant had joint title to Lot no. 4 under deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d and deed of transfer no. 2937 marked \u201c1\u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d and moved that judgment be entered partitioning Lot no. 4 between the 1st and 2nd defendants.

Since she resided in Kandy, she relied on her aunt [Weerasuriya\u2019s wife and the mother of the 1st and 2nd defendants] to look after Lot no. 4 and the plaintiff\u2019s interests in that property. In January 1993, the plaintiff became aware that some person had commenced constructing a building on Lot no.4. She made a complaint to the Police and the construction work stopped. She later became aware that the 1st defendant had commenced construction work on Lot no. 4 in May 1995. When she made further inquiries, she also became aware of the aforesaid Partition Case no. 3896/P. The plaintiff immediately filed the aforesaid Revision Application and the Court of Appeal set aside the interlocutory decree and final decree entered in the Partition Case. On this basis, the plaintiff prayed for the reliefs referred to earlier. The 1st defendant and 2nd defendant filed separate answers pleading that, although Lot no. 4 had been purchased in De Silva\u2019s name as set out in deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d, Weerasuriya [their father] had provided the consideration and De Silva had not repaid Weerasuriya. The defendants pleaded that neither De Silva nor the plaintiff have had possession of Lot no. 4 at any point in time and that, from 1959 onwards, Weerasuriya had exclusive possession of Lot no. 4 together with Lot no. 2 and Lot no. 3 [which two Lots had been purchased by him in his own name]. They pleaded that Weerasuriya had paid the Municipal Rates for Lot no. 4.

The defendants also claimed compensation for improvements made to Lot. No. 4. At the trial, the plaintiff gave evidence and led the evidence of official witnesses from the Batticaloa Land Registry, the Kurunegala Municipal Council, the Registry of the Court of Appeal and the Kurunegala Land Registry. Thereafter, the 1st defendant gave evidence. He also led the evidence of a witness who had worked for his father [Weerasuriya] and the evidence of a witness to deed of transfer no. 2937 marked \u201c1 \u0dc0\u0dd24\u201d. At the commencement of the trial, the parties framed no less than 42 issues based on their pleadings.

Thereafter, the trial judge expressed his view that Weerasuriya and later the defendants held Lot no. 4 subject to a constructive trust in favour of De Silva and the plaintiff.

With regard to the defendant\u2019s claim of prescriptive title, the learned trial judge appears to have accepted the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that De Silva [her father] had fenced Lot no. 1 sometime after purchasing that property under and in terms of deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d, and that, since the plaintiff resided in Kandy, she had asked her aunt [Weerasuriya\u2019s wife] who lived on the adjoining property, to look after Lot no. 4 for the plaintiff and relied on her aunt to fulfil that duty. The learned trial judge emphatically stated that he believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that Weerasuriya regularly sent produce from Lot no. 4 [in the form of coconuts sent via the train service] to De Silva, in Batticaloa and, thereby, acknowledged De Silva\u2019s title to Lot no. 4. The learned judge rejected the 1st defendant\u2019s denial that his father [Weerasuriya] sent produce from Lot no. 4 to De Silva. The trial judge also noted that De Silva and his daughter, the plaintiff on the one hand, and Weerasuriya and his wife and the defendants [the plaintiff\u2019s uncle, aunt and cousins] on the other, were all close relatives who had amicable relationships with each other until the litigation commenced.",

Accordingly, the District Court rejected the claim of prescriptive title relied on by the 1st and 2nd defendants. Thereafter, the learned trial judge dealt with the 1st defendant\u2019s claim that he had constructed a house on Lot No. 4 incurring expenditure of Rs. 1,000,000/- and that he was entitled to compensation for that improvement and a jus retentionis until that compensation was paid to him. The learned judge held that the 1st defendant was aware that the plaintiff had title to Lot No. 4 but, nevertheless, constructed the house while knowing that it was being built on the plaintiff\u2019s land. The District Court held that, in these circumstances, the 1st defendant could not claim to be a bona fide possessor and that he was not entitled to compensation for the cost of the house. Finally, the learned District Judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages in a sum of Rs. 10,000/- per month on account of deprivation of the income the plaintiff could have earned from Lot no. 4 during the pendency of the action. However, the learned judge held that these damages should be fully set off against the value of the house which would accrue to the plaintiff and that, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any monetary damages from the 1st and 2nd defendants. In appeal, the learned High Court Judges observed that deed of transfer no. 3374 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d established a transfer of Lot no. 4 to De Silva and that the trial judge erred when he took the view that Weerasuriya obtained title under \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d and held Lot no. 4 was subject to a constructive trust in favour of De Silva. The High Court was of the view that De Silva held title to Lot. No. 4 by operation of \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d. The High Court upheld the trial judge\u2019s rejection of the defence of prescriptive title claimed by the defendants. The High Court also affirmed the District Court\u2019s determination with regard to the compensation for improvements claimed by the 1st defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, as mentioned earlier. The questions of law The six questions of law on which the 1st defendant has been granted leave to appeal are reproduced verbatim:",

In fact, the 1st defendant admitted this in cross examination. Thus, when he was shown \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d and asked \u201c\u0db8\u0dda \u0d94\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dda \u0d9c\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dda\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dc3 \u0daf \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf?\u201d, he replied \u201c\u0d94\u0dda.\u201d.

They have gone on to observe that \u201cAs the Appellant has stated and also seen from the case record neither party has suggested any issue on a constructive trust.\u201d. The judgment of the High Court also states that \u201cTherefore, it is common ground that P.01 [\u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d] is in the name of Punyadasa [De Silva] and he is the vendee.\u201d. Thus, a reading of the judgment of the High Court establishes that the learned High Court Judges decided that the District Judge had erred when he held that the deed of transfer marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d was a transfer of title to Weerasuriya, who then held Lot no. 4 subject to a constructive trust in favour of De Silva. The fact that this was the view of the learned High Court Judges can be deduced from several statements and observations in the judgment of the High Court. Regrettably, the judgment of the High Court fails to make a specific statement to that effect. It would have been much better if the learned High Court Judges had set out their determination with more clarity. Accordingly, question of law no. (i) has to be answered in the negative. Before moving on to the other questions of law, it should be mentioned that it is evident from the judgment of the District Court that, despite the learned District Judge having erred when he expressed a view that a constructive trust existed, he eventually decided the action by answering the 42 issues framed by the parties based on their pleadings - ie: (i) the plaintiff\u2019s issues framed on the basis of a rei vindicatio; and (ii) the issues framed by the 1st and 2nd defendants based on the defence of prescriptive title. The question of a constructive trust did not figure in any of these 42 issues framed by the parties and answered by the learned District Judge and based on which the District Court entered its judgment. Thus, the learned District Judge\u2019s aforesaid error in expressing a view that Weerasuriya had title to Lot no. 4 and held the property subject to a constructive trust in favour of De Silva, did not play a part in the eventual determination of the action as set out in the judgment of the District Court. For that reason, it is unnecessary to make a determination as to whether the District Judge erred when he framed new issues at the stage of writing the judgment without first giving the parties notice of the proposed new issues - vide: HAMEED vs. CASSIM [1996 2 SLR 30] and the more recent judgment in SEYLAN BANK PLC vs. EPASINGHE [SC CHC Appeal no. 36/2006 decided on 01st August 2017]. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court establishes that the learned Judges recognised that the trial Judge\u2019s mistaken idea of a constructive trust and the new issues he referred to in his judgment, played no part in the eventual determination of the",

    "text": "action in the District Court. Thus, the High Court Judges have observed in their judgment that \u201cThe parties have presented their respective cases and the court had accepted the points on which they are at variance without any reference to a constructive trust.\u201d. This is undoubtedly a reference to the fact that, although the trial judge was initially distracted by a mistaken idea of the existence of a constructive trust, he eventually \u2018got back on track\u2019 as it were, and decided the case by answering the issues framed by the parties as set out in their pleadings. Next, questions of law no.s (ii), (iii) and (iv) can be considered together as they all deal with the High Court\u2019s decision to uphold the District Court\u2019s rejection of the 1st defendant\u2019s plea that he and the 2nd defendant had prescriptive title to Lot no. 4. In this connection, and as mentioned earlier, it is evident on the face of the deed of transfer marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d itself that Weerasuriya acted as De Silva\u2019s agent and bid on De Silva\u2019s behalf to purchase Lot no. 4 at the public auction. Thereafter, Weerasuriya has acted on behalf of De Silva when he entered into the agreement setting out the Conditions of Sale and later delivered payment of the consideration to the seller [Jayawickrama] prior to the execution of the deed of transfer marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d by which De Silva obtained title to Lot no. 4. Further, as stated earlier, Weerasuriya has placed his signature on \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 11\u201d to acknowledge that he acted on behalf of De Silva and as De Silva\u2019s agent in this entire transaction. These circumstances add substance to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that, after her father [De Silva] purchased Lot no. 4, his brother-in-law, Weerasuriya continued to act on behalf of De Silva and \u2018looked after\u2019 Lot no.4 on behalf of De Silva. The existence of such a relationship between De Silva and Weerasuriya with regard to Lot no. 4 is made likely by the fact that both parties admit that there were amicable relations between them as family members, and that Weerasuriya resided in Kurunegala while De Silva resided in Batticaloa and could not `look after\u2019 Lot no. 4 on his own. It also has to be kept in mind that Weerasuriya had purchased the neighbouring Lot no. 2 and Lot no. 3 in his own name at the public auction and later constructed his residence on these two Lots which adjoined Lot no. 4. Thus, Weerasuriya was well placed to conveniently `keep an eye\u2019 on Lot no. 4 on behalf of his brother-in-law, De Silva. The plaintiff has testified that, after she obtained title to Lot no. 4, she asked her aunt [Weerasuriya\u2019s wife and the defendants\u2019 mother] to `look after\u2019 that property for the plaintiff. That evidence is plausible since the plaintiff resided in Kandy and it is likely that she would ask her aunt, who resided in the neighbouring Lot no. 2 and Lot no. 3, to `look after\u2019 Lot no. 4 for the plaintiff.",

    "text": "In these circumstances, the inference is that Weerasuriya and his sons, the 1st and 2nd defendants, were in a position of agents of De Silva and the plaintiff and in a position of trust vis-\u00e0-vis Lot no. 4 and the plaintiff\u2019s rights to Lot no. 4. In such circumstances, the 1st defendant cannot succeed in a claim that he and his father [Weerasuriya] possessed Lot no. 4 adverse to the rights of the plaintiff and her father [De Silva] unless there is clear evidence of an unmistakeable act of ouster of the rights of the plaintiff and De Silva or there has been exclusive possession of Lot no. 4 by Weerasuriya and the 1st defendant for a long period of time in circumstances which give rise to a presumption of ouster in their favour. Thus, in NAGUDA MARIKAR vs. MOHAMMADU [7 NLR 91] the Privy Council held that, in the absence of any evidence to show that the plaintiff had got rid of his character of agent, he was not entitled to the benefit of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. On the same lines, in SIYANERIS vs. JAYASINGHE UDENIS DE SILVA [52 NLR 289 at p.292], the Privy Council emphasised that \u201c\u2026if a person goes into possession of land in Ceylon as an agent for another time does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is holding adversely to his principal.\u201d [emphasis mine]. Similar views were expressed by Bertram CJ in TILLEKERATNE vs. BASTIAN [21 NLR 12 at p. 19] and by Weeramantry J In JAYANERIS vs. SOMAWATHIE [76 NLR 206 at p. 207-208]. Accordingly, the evidence has to be examined to ascertain whether there has been such an act of ouster committed by Weerasuriya and the 1st defendant or whether the evidence justifies drawing a presumption of ouster in their favour. The 1st defendant placed great store on the evidence that his father [Weerasuriya] had paid the Municipal Rates for Lot no. 4 for many years. However, it is a well-known principle that the payment of Municipal Rates will not, by itself, establish a claim of prescriptive title since any person, especially persons occupying a property in a subordinate capacity such as an agent, tenant, or licensee, can tender payment of Municipal Rates - vide: Basnayake CJ in HASSAN vs. ROMANSIHAMY [66 CLW 112 at p. 112] and De Silva CJ in SIRAJUDDIN vs. ABBAS [1994 2 SLR 365 at p. 370]. Next, the plaintiff testified that sometime after Lot no. 4 was purchased by her father [De Silva], he erected a fence to demarcate Lot no. 4. The 1st defendant made no claim that he or his father [Weerasuriya] had erected a fence to demarcate Lot no. 4. When the Court Commissioner surveyed Lot no. 4 on 08th July 1993 in pursuance of the Commission issued to him in the aforesaid D.C. Kurunegala Partition Case no. 3896/P, he has reported that the Northern boundary of Lot no. 4 [which adjoined Gangoda Road] was demarcated by a fence; the Eastern boundary [which adjoined the land of a third party] was demarcated by a fence and a wall; the Southern boundary [which",

This independent and reliable evidence corroborates the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that her father had erected a fence to demarcate the boundaries of Lot no. 4, especially since the 1st defendant made no claim that he or his father had erected a fence. It also comes to mind that, if Weerasuriya and his sons [the 1st and 2nd defendants] had possessed Lot no. 4 in their own right as they claimed, there would have been little reason for them to fence it off from their adjoining Lot no. 2 and Lot no. 3 and, thereby, lose the opportunity of having a contiguous area of land which consisted of Lot no. 2, Lot no. 3 and Lot no. 4 with an aggregate extent of A:0 R:03 P:02. Therefore, the existence of concrete posts demarcating Lot no. 4 suggests that Weerasuriya and his sons [the 1st and 2nd defendants] were not in possession of Lot no. 4. The Court Commissioner has also reported that when he surveyed Lot no. 4 on 08th July 1993, there were 08 coconut trees which were about 60/70 years old. This tallies closely with the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that there were about ten coconut trees on Lot no. 4 when her father purchased it in 1959. This leads to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that Weerasuriya sent coconuts plucked from Lot no. 4 to De Silva, by train, once in every three months. The plaintiff\u2019s position was that Weerasuriya did this in acknowledgment of De Silva\u2019s title to Lot no. 4 and De Silva\u2019s right to the produce from the land. The 1st defendant denied that his father, Weerasuriya sent coconuts to Weerasuriya. It is to be noted that the 1st defendant did not suggest that Weerasuriya even occasionally sent coconuts to De Silva as gifts out of affection for his brother-in-law who resided Batticaloa. In these circumstances, the question of whether Weerasuriya regularly sent coconuts plucked from Lot no. 4 to De Silva in acknowledgement that De Silva had title to Lot no. 4 and was entitled to the produce from the land, assumes importance in deciding the defence of prescription claimed by the 1st defendant. In this regard it has to be kept in mind that since the 1st defendant did not offer an explanation that Weerasuriya occasionally sent coconuts to De Silva by way of a gift and, instead, denied that Weerasuriya sent coconuts to De Silva at any time, evidence that Weerasuriya did regularly send coconuts to De Silva can only mean that he did so in acknowledgement that De Silva had title to Lot no. 4 and was entitled to the produce from the land.",

This is not to say that the Judge of first instance can be treated as infallible in determining which side is telling the truth or is refraining from exaggeration. Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance that a judge of first instance, when estimating the value of verbal testimony, has the advantage (which is denied to courts of appeal) of having the witnesses before him and observing the manner in which their evidence is given.\" Similarly, in COLLETTES vs. BANK OF CEYLON [1984 2 SLR 253 at p.264], Sharvananda J, as he then was, stated \"Thus this court undoubtedly has the jurisdiction to revise the concurrent findings of fact reached by the lower court in appropriate cases.
