Zone, alleged the infringement of their fundamental rights by the Police in quelling

a protest held by the Free Trade Zone workers against a proposed bill that would

affect them. Counsel representing the Petitioners in all the cases referred to in the

caption, were agreeable to consider these applications together in view of the fact

In 2011 a bill was tabled, titled the Employees Pension Benefits Fund Bill which

proposed to introduce a pension scheme for private sector workers. The workers

of the Katunayake Free Trade Zone (FTZ) entertained an apprehension that this bill

would affect their savings related to EPF, ETF, gratuity etc. The Joint Trade Union

Alliance (JTUA) which opposed the aforesaid bill held a seminar to educate the

workers on the adverse consequences of the bill at the Jayawardene Centre in

Colombo. On the 24th of May 2011 a protest organized by JTUA was held with the

participation of about 40,000 FTZ workers to demonstrate their opposition to the

bill. The protest was held outside the FTZ at the 18th Mile Post since the Police had

prevented the protestors from congregating at the Urban Council Grounds in

Katunayake. The protest had obstructed vehicular traffic and trains plying along

the railway line nearby. At the conclusion of the protest an altercation had

occurred, with the Seeduwa Police and having to baton charge and use tear gas.

Around 30 protestors had been arrested in the process, who had been later

released.

8

A few days later on 28th May, an impromptu meeting was held at the BOI

Auditorium within the FTZ with the participation of the Minister for Labour and

representatives of the FTZ workers. The meeting had been attended by other

politicians of the Government as well. At the meeting no agreement could be

reached by the parties. Following the meeting, leaflets urging the workers to

support the bill were distributed by an unidentified group of persons purporting

to be members of the JTUA. The leaflets carried the name of the JTUA but it carried

the address of a political party. The Police, however, had allowed these persons to

distribute leaflets within the FTZ premises. In the early hours of the 29th a large

number of posters soliciting support for the bill had also sprung up in and around

the FTZ.

In such a volatile backdrop, on the 30th of May 2011 the day on which the alleged

violations took place, around 4000 to 5000 FTZ workers had commenced their

protest within the FTZ premises around 10.15 am. At the time, around 600

protestors had gathered, and scores of Police Officers had also been present on

duty presumably to control the situation had it disturbed the public tranquility.

Coincidently, around 11 am on that day, the Seeduwa Brandex (sic) Factory had

to be closed and the workers sent home due to a contamination of its water supply

which had caused diarrhea among the workers. On an earlier occasion i.e. on the

24th the demonstrators had come in a procession and attempted to get the

employees of the same factory to join the protest on the 24th. (vide page 3 of the

Presidential Committee Report on the incident, the Mahanama Tilakaratne

Report). Even though the protest had started peacefully, towards noon the

situation had become tense with the number of protestors increasing and stones

being pelted on both sides. Even though several politicians had intervened and

assured that the bill would not be passed without heeding the views of the FTZ

workers, they had continued the protest demanding a credible guarantee of such

assurance.

9

Around 10.30 am pelting of stones had started and stones had been thrown back

and forth. The version of the Police is that it had been communicated to the

protestors through loudspeakers by the Senior Police Officers that the FTZ workers

would be taken out of the purview of the bill and that steps were being taken to

broadcast that decision over the media as requested by the protestors (per the

statement of objections of the Fourth Respondent) and, later that the bill would be

withdrawn (per the statement of objections of the Third Respondent). Despite these

guarantees the protestors who had congregated near Gate IV of Phase II of the FTZ

had not dispersed but kept moving towards the roads. Thereafter, without

warning, stones had been pelted towards the police. Dhanawardene Gurusinghe,

Negombo Assistant Superintendent of Police in his affidavit marked as 5R2 with

the statement of Objections of the 5th Respondent states that a large amount of

stones was pelted at the Police by a group of persons who were about 25 meters

behind the protestors, a position taken up by the Inspector General of Police, the

4th Respondent in his Statement of Objection as well. The president of the CMU

Union admitted that the stones thrown at them by the Police were thrown back at

the Police by them (vide page 7, Presidential Committee report). The Respondents

allege that when the police officers who were taken by surprise retreated to the

Katunayake police station to avoid further injuries, the protestors had started

attacking the police station which was situated about 100m away from Gate IV

damaging property within the premises and several police vehicles.

The position taken up by the Respondents is that there was an apprehension that

the protestors may barge out of the FTZ causing further damage. The 1st

Respondent OIC of the Katunayake Police Station in his statement of Objections

had stated that DIG Ravi Wijegunawardena was assaulted by the protestors and

had to be hospitalized since he was badly wounded. According to the Respondents

Tear Gas was fired to protect the Police Officers retreating from the stone attack.

The statements recorded in the Presidential Committee Report and the petitions

reveal that it had been around 12.30 pm when the Police had fired tear gas on the

10

protestors and charged them with batons, iron rods etc. Firearms had also been

fired.

I shall first detail the case of each Petitioner and the alleged events that they had

had to face on the 30th.

Around 10.15 am the petitioner in FR application 265/2011, H. M. M. Sampath

Kumara too had joined the protest along with the majority of the workers of the

factory where he was employed at. Having been in one of the open areas of the FTZ

where the protestors had been gathered, he had started to run towards the Crystal

Martin factory to escape the charge. While he was running he had been hit by

gunfire and had fallen down. He had then been carried into the factory where he

worked by several other workers. Due to the critical nature of his injuries the

petitioner had been taken to the Negombo Base Hospital where he had had to

undergo surgery and was kept in the Intensive Care Unit. Later he was transferred

to the Colombo General Hospital where he remained warded. Due to the gunshot

injuries received, the petitioner who was 19 years old at the time, has sustained

permanent disabilities of a serious nature affecting his reproductive and digestive

systems.

Another FTZ worker, 22-year-old Roshen Chanaka succumbed to the injuries

sustained due to the shooting.

Following the firing of tear gas and live ammunition and the subsequent charge,

the facts reveal that, the police had launched an attack on the factories within the

FTZ- Phase II, entering their premises by force, damaging property and

indiscriminately attacking those within the respective premises. All the petitioners

except the petitioner in SC FR 265/2011 had been assaulted by the police with

blunt weapons during this attack. After the attack the Petitioners in SC FR

268/2011, 270/2011, 271/2011, 272/2011, 273/2011, 274/2011,

346/2011, 347/2011 and 348/2011 had been detained at the Katunayake Police

11

Station before being sent to receive medical treatment. Their affidavits bear

testimony to the attack carried out by the police against the workers.

The Petitioner in FR Application 266/2011, Rohitha Amarasinghe, an employee of

the Toroid International Factory had joined the protest with his fellow workers.

They had congregated near the MAS Active Factory and had gradually moved into

the more open spaces of the FTZ. Isolated skirmishes had started to break out

between the police and the protestors by this time. He states that around 12.30 pm

the police suddenly made a concerted move to disperse the demonstration by firing

tear gas and engaging in a baton charge resulting in the workers rushing into the

nearby factories for safety. Hundreds of Police officers had then broken into the

factories such as Toroid International, DSL Global and Noratel. The petitioner,

having accompanied another protestor who had received an injury during a

skirmish into the factory, had been inside the factory at this time. Due to the tense

situation outside and having heard gunshots immediately after their return to the

factory the petitioner had remained within the factory.

When the police entered the factory premises by force the petitioner along with

other workers had fled into the locker room of Toroid International and locked

themselves in. However, the police had broken down the door with iron rods and

dragged them out of the lavatories where they were hiding by this time. The police

had also dragged along some female workers, forced them to kneel and had started

to assault them. When the petitioner attempted to intervene, he had been assaulted

with iron rods and kicked and trampled on. When they were subsequently

instructed to leave the factory, the petitioner finding it difficult to walk, had

crawled out and on his way, he had been detained by some police officers who

forced him to stand against a wall and had assaulted him with a rubber hose. The

Petitioner was then dragged towards the Human Resource office of the factory

where several other injured workers were gathered and were transported to the

Negombo Base Hospital in a van belonging to the factory.

12

Because of the attack detailed above, the petitioner Amarasinghe had sustained a

fracture of his right 3rd finger and contusions to his left upper arm. Having had a

known history of Epilepsy for which he had not been on regular treatment for 2

years, the petitioner had also developed fitting attacks while he was in hospital and

continues to suffer from panic attacks.

During the charge following the tear gas attack, the petitioner in SCFR 267/2011,

Buddhika Atapattu who had also joined the protest around 10.00 am, had run back

to his factory Noratel International where he and several others had been assaulted

with iron rods, iron chains and transformer parts (manufactured in the factory)

by the Police who had pursued them there. In shielding himself from a blow to the

head by an iron rod his wrist had got fractured. Around 1.00pm they had been

taken near the FTZ gate where other workers who also had severe injuries had

been gathered. There, they had been assaulted by the Police again before being

taken to the Negombo Base Hospital.

Having finished the night shift at A.T.G Gloves around 6.00 am, Dhanushka

Sanjeewa, the Petitioner in 268/2011 had returned to his boarding house nearby.

Around 10.00 am the Petitioner had gone to Phase II to withdraw money from the

Automated Teller Machine there. The protest had commenced by then and, there

had been around 4000 to 5000 workers gathered. When the Petitioner attempted

to exit Phase II the police at the gate had refused to allow him to pass through.

Thereafter, not being able to leave Phase II the Petitioner too had joined the protest.

When the police charge occurred, he had run inside A.T.G Gloves. Around 2.00

pm a Sectional Head of the factory had locked the entrance to that area of the

factory with the help of the petitioner and some other workers. In the meantime,

the police had broken into the factory and 25-30 police officers had demanded

that the locked entrance be opened. When those inside did not comply, they had

begun to destroy the wooden and glass fixtures outside. Therefore, the Sectional

Head had opened the door and the police had entered and assaulted everyone

13

inside with batons. The petitioner had received blows to his head, left wrist, right

arm and torso. The blows on his head had made the petitioner nauseous and he

had started to vomit. The workers had then been forced to leave the factory

premises and then ordered to kneel down and assaulted again.

Following the assault, they had been taken to the Katunayake Police Station on foot

and detained in a cell with 50-60 other workers including those injured due to

live ammunition and due to the use of tear gas. Though many had been screaming

in pain and the petitioner himself was bleeding they had not been given any

assistance by the police. After about three hours, his personal details had been

recorded. The police had then announced that the injured would be taken to

Negombo Base Hospital and had asked them to come out. Though some had gone

out, the petitioner had not joined them due to the uncertainty about what the police

would do next. Eventually, he had been released around 5.00 pm and had returned

to his boarding place from where a friend had taken him to the Negombo Base

Hospital. Reaching the hospital around 6.30 pm the petitioner had been turned

away due to overcrowding.

The petitioner in application 269/2011, Anesh Imalka Fernando had reported to

work at Toroid International around 1.30 pm on the 30th and joined the protestors

after putting on his uniform. When the Police charged the protestors, he had run

into Toroid International and escaped through a door at the rear of the building.

However, he had been caught by some police officers and had been assaulted while

two police officers held him tightly by the arms. He asserts that the assault

continued even after he fell down feeling faintish. After some time, a police officer

had shaken him and when he opened his eyes he had again been assaulted with

iron rods and kicked by that same officer and then ordered to walk to the main

gate of the FTZ. By this time he had noticed two wounds on his hands and when

he had told the police officer that he is unable to stand up he had been told to crawl

there. When the petitioner tried to stand up he had been assaulted again. However,

14

the petitioner had managed to walk to the gate with great difficulty and collapsed

there. He had seen other workers too being assaulted. Around 3.00 pm he had been

taken to the Negombo Base Hospital by his fellow workers and had to have stitches

to his head and ears and had been referred to the Eye Clinic. Even by the date of

his application to this court, the petitioner states that he continues to suffer from

bodily pains accompanied by dizziness. (Medico-legal report states that even

though the injuries are non-grievous, if the scar on the forehead becomes

prominent after healing, it may disfigure the face and therefore could be

categorized as grievous under limb (f) of Section 311 of the Penal Code.)

Being an employee of Naigai Lanka the petitioner in application 270/2011, N. L.

T. Iresha had joined the protest around 12 noon along with the majority of the

workers at the factory. She and other Naigai Lanka workers had run back to the

factory when the police charged the protestors. However, the police had caught up

with them and abused them in contumelious language and had ordered them to

kneel on the ground. When they complied, they had been beaten with iron poles

repeatedly, resulting in injuries to her upper arms, elbow and torso, several of

which resulted in bleeding. After several minutes, the petitioner and the others had

been ordered to leave/run and when they attempted to do so they had been

assaulted on their back and buttock areas and were physically apprehended.

Afterwards, the female workers had been handed over to three women police

constables who had been outside Naigai Lanka. They had escorted the petitioner

and the others on foot to the Katunayake Police Station and had assaulted them on

the way as well. They had been repeatedly scolded in abusive language to the effect

that they were allowed inside the FTZ to work and not to protest.

At the Katunayake Police Station, when they had attempted to sit on the benches

there they had been scolded by a woman police constable and forced to sit on the

floor. Then, around 1.00pm they had been taken to the Crime Branch of the Police

Station and locked inside a room with 8-10 other female workers. Within a period

15

of about one hour almost 60 female workers had been detained in that room. Due

to the crowding the petitioner and several others had suffered from claustrophobic

feelings and breathing difficulties akin to asthma or panic attacks. There had been

several workers detained in that room who had bleeding wounds, including those

sustained from live ammunition and tear gas. They had not been given any first-

aid or medical assistance. In addition to these traumatic events, the petitioner states

that she heard the screams of persons outside the room whom she believes were

male workers. Around 4.30/5.00 pm those of the detainees who had injuries,

including the petitioner had been forced onto a bus and taken to the Negombo Base

Hospital. The Petitioners name and address had been taken down by the Hospital

Police Post, but no statement had been recorded. However, she had been forced to

sign a document by the Police. Due to the injuries sustained, the petitioner has been

rendered unable to fully extend or flex her left arm, at the time of the application.

An employee of Sterling Lanka, the petitioner in application 271/2011, Nisshanka

Wanigasekera had reported for work around 6.45 in the morning of the 30th.

Around 9.15 am he had gone to the Smart Shirt warehouse situated in Phase II by

three-wheeler, accompanied by the driver, Jayatissa and another worker named

Nilusha, in order to collect and deliver some samples. When they were returning

to Sterling Lanka around12 noon the roads had been blocked due to the protest

and since they were unable to proceed further by three-wheeler the driver had

stopped the vehicle on the side of the road. By this time the police had been

behaving in an aggressive manner and minor skirmishes were breaking out

between the protestors and the police. When the police made the concerted move

to disperse the protestors around 30 police officers had attacked their three-

wheeler as well and dragged out the petitioner and his companions. The petitioner

asserts that he had been brutally assaulted with iron rods until he lost

consciousness and became separated from his companions. He had suffered

injuries to his jaw, teeth, nose and fingers of the left arm resulting in bleeding. The

petitioner had lost consciousness several times but recalls that he was dragged to

16

the Katunayake Police Station by two police officers and that he regained

consciousness inside a police cell in the company of Jayatissa. There had been about

50 persons detained in the cell, some with injuries from live ammunition and the

use of tear gas. Even though the petitioner had been bleeding and vomiting blood

and many of the detainees had been screaming in pain, no assistance had been

provided by the police. Later, the petitioner had been dragged out of the cell and a

woman police constable had recorded the details on his factory identity card. He

had been assaulted again before being dragged onto a bus and taken to the

Negombo Base Hospital.

The petitioner states that he is unable to recall the details of his hospitalization

properly due to the trauma he underwent. However, he recalls receiving stitches

to the head and being transferred to the National Hospital immediately via

ambulance, since he was vomiting blood. As his jaw and several teeth had broken

an iron plate had been inserted into his jaw. His nose had been broken and he had

been informed that it would require surgery in the near future. A statement had

been recorded from him by an officer in civilian clothing. He had not been shown

that statement but had been required to sign some document the details of which

he cannot recall. Due to the injuries the petitioner is unable to flex the fingers in

his left arm. He has trouble breathing and finds it difficult to move his jaw which

causes difficulties when eating. At the time of the application he was undergoing

further treatment and was in severe pain.

The Petitioner in application 272/2011, Jayatissa Rajakaruna drove the three-

wheeler in which the petitioner in 271/2011(Nisshanka) had been travelling.

During the attack on them the police had caused damage to the three-wheeler and

assaulted the petitioner on his arms, left leg, back and head with iron rods while

some police officers restrained him. He had received a bleeding wound to the head.

He was then taken to the Katunayake Police Station on foot. About an hour later he

had observed that Nisshanka who had been separated from him earlier was also

17

put into the same cell and could not even stand unaided and was in severe pain.

Around 3.30/4.00 pm the injured workers in the cell had been forced onto a

private bus and taken to the Negombo Base Hospital. The petitioner was admitted

to Ward 2 which he believes to be the Eye Ward of the hospital and states that

during his stay there until the 02nd of June he noticed a heavy police presence at

the hospital. The petitioner states that at the date of the application he still finds it

difficult to walk in addition to bouts of dizziness.

The petitioner in 273/2011, Ranjan Lasantha Perera an employee of the Smart

Shirt factory had been within the factory premises when around 12 noon he had

witnessed hundreds of protestors fleeing from the police attack and entering the

factory premises. He had heard gunfire and had feared for his life. Several dozen

police officers had broken open the factory gate and had assaulted the security

officers who attempted to prevent them. The factorys security room had been

destroyed in the process. Several police officers had opened fire within the factory

premises and caused injuries to the fleeing workers and damaged the factory

property. He had run to the canteen area of Smart Shirt where he and several other

workers had been chased by a group of police officers armed with batons and

weapons. They had cornered the petitioner and the others and had assaulted them

with batons and wooden planks. When the petitioner fell down due to the attack

he had been told to stand up and had been assaulted on the head, legs and arms.

Due to this he had sustained injuries to his left leg and fractured his right leg.

Around 2.00 pm the petitioner had been carried to the Katunayake Police Station

by four of the police officers who had assaulted him. The petitioner had been left

outside the police station building. Later he had been instructed to go to the police

cell and since he could not walk he had crawled into the Police station. Around

4.30 pm he had been carried into a bus by police officers and taken to the Negombo

Base Hospital.

18

The Petitioner in FR Application 274/2011, Lalinda Herath who was employed at

the Global Sports Factory had not joined the protest even though about 50 workers

from his factory had joined it. In their attack on the factories the police had forcibly

entered the Global Sports Factory by assaulting the Security Personnel and

proceeded to assault the Petitioner and his fellow workers. In order to avoid the

attack, they had run towards the printing room of the cutting section, during

which time the petitioner had been continuously attacked by a police officer. The

police had then broken the glass windows of the room and assaulted the petitioner

and four others who were taking cover there. The petitioner had been beaten on

the ears, head and stomach. After the beating they had been ordered to leave the

room two by two holding hands. Then they had been taken to the Katunayake

Police Station and detained in a cell for about 45 minutes. They had been checked

by police officers and Rs. 2000 which had been in the petitioners pocket had been

taken away. After this period of detention, the petitioner along with other injured

workers had been forced onto a bus and taken to the Negombo Base Hospital,

where he was admitted for treatment. At the time of filing the application the

petitioner asserts that he was still suffering from pain in his ears and his hearing

had been impaired. (Medico-Legal Report dated 8th August 2011 by Judicial

Medical Officer, Negombo District General Hospital however only records a

contusion of 6cm into 3cm on the lower side of the left cheek.)

The Petitioner in application 346/2011, Pradeep Kumara Priyadarshana who was

an employee of Noratel International had joined the protest around 11.30 am

along with the majority of his fellow workers at the factory. The Police had fired

tear gas on the protestors gathered near the entrance to Phase II and charged them,

throwing stones and other objects at the protestors fleeing them. In paragraph 12

of his petition, the Petitioner states that since several hundred workers converged

near Noratel International after the charge, they spontaneously decided to engage

in a peaceful sit-in/ sit-down there, in which the petitioner too had participated

in. The police who had by this time dispersed the protest near Gate IV of Phase II

19

had proceeded into the FTZ continuing to use tear gas as well as iron rods. While

some protestors had been severely injured, the petitioner and others had managed

to flee into Noratel International. However, police officers had forced their way in

to the factory, assaulting the security officers who attempted to prevent them and

demolishing the factory security room. Thereafter the police had broken into the

factory by breaking doors and windows and had even fired tear gas into the factory

causing asthma-like symptoms in some workers. The petitioner and about 75

others had barricaded themselves inside the Production Office on the upper floor.

The police had then surrounded the office and threatened them in abusive and

contumelious language threatening to open fire if they did not come out. Due to

these threats the workers had come out of the office and had been compelled to

walk in between about 100 police officers who continuously assaulted them on

their way to the exit of the factory. The police had kept up an angry rhetoric that

they were allowed inside the FTZ only to work and not to protest. The petitioners

right arm was fractured due to the assault and was bleeding profusely. When the

workers came out of the factory they had been ordered to sit down on the ground

inside the factory premises, where some workers including a pregnant worker

were again assaulted.

According to the Petitioner, Priyadarshana around 1.30 pm these workers had

been transported to the Katunayake Police Station by a bus where their personal

details were recorded by a woman police constable who verbally abused them for

taking part in the protest. An Army officer who appeared to be a high ranking

official and another person who appeared to be a local politician had informed

them that the enactment of the bill was halted and instructed them to return to the

FTZ and inform the protestors within, of this development. Accordingly, the

workers had been loaded onto a bus and taken to Phase II where several hundred

protestors were congregated. Several army officers who had been on the bus had

then instructed them to inform the other protestors that the bill would be halted.

At this point, the workers on the bus who were in severe pain due to injuries and

20

the tear gas attack pleaded with the driver to take them to a hospital whereby they

were taken to the Vijaya Kumaratunga Memorial Hospital. Upon admission there,

due to the critical nature of their wounds, the petitioner and several others were

immediately transferred to the Ragama Teaching Hospital.

Around 1.45 pm on the 30th, the petitioner in application 347/2011, Nalin

Sanjaya Jayatileke had made his way to the First Aid Room of Noratel Lanka as he

had been suffering from a headache. On his way he had noticed that the protestors

were being chased by the police while continuously assaulting them with batons.

He had also been caught up in this and had been caught by a police officer. When

he explained that he had not been engaged in any unlawful activity he had been

released by that police officer. However other police officers in the vicinity had

ordered that no one should be allowed to leave and then he had been continuously

assaulted by several police officers and forcibly taken to the entrance of Noratel

Lanka where he had been instructed to sit on the ground. Several dozen workers

had been forced to sit there and some of them had injuries from live ammunition,

iron rods and injuries caused by the firing of tear gas. Around 100 police officers

had been present there and several of them had been assaulting the workers seated

there. While there the petitioner had been assaulted several times on the back of

his head, left side of the jaw, back and the left side of the cheek below the eye. The

petitioner had fainted due to the severe pain from the assault especially from the

blows below the eye which had caused a fracture. The petitioner had regained

consciousness after some time and the police had instructed one of the workers to

bring a vehicle belonging to the factory to transport the injured to the factory.

Upon a Noratel Lanka Nurse who was present there informing the police that their

officers were damaging private vehicles and therefore it would not be safe to

transport the injured they had agreed to send one of their officers to prevent any

such attack. The petitioner and about 10 other workers who had been seriously

injured had been taken by van to the hospital. Several of those workers had been

unconscious and some had been drifting in and out of consciousness. Whilst within

21

Phase II the van had been stopped by police and instructed to go to the Katunayake

Police Station instead of the hospital. At the Police Station a woman police constable

had recorded the personal details of the workers despite the semi-conscious or

incoherent state some of them were in. They had been taken to the hospital only

afterwards. On the 31st, since the Negombo Base Hospital had been overcrowded

with injured workers the petitioner had been discharged against his will and had

not been given any documents regarding his treatment. On the 01st of June, as he

was coughing up blood the petitioner had attempted to admit himself to the Kandy

Teaching Hospital but had been turned away since he did not have any medical

reports or official discharge papers. Subsequently, he had been admitted to a

private hospital in Kandy since he was bleeding from the mouth. X-rays taken there

had revealed that the bone below his left eye had been fractured.

The petitioner in application 348/2011, Sameera Sandaruwan Hettiarachchi had

entered Phase II to report to work at Noratel Lanka around 1.30 pm. There had

been a large number of police officers at the gate and he had been allowed inside

only after an extensive security check. He had observed injured workers lying on

the ground and some being escorted out of the FTZ by the police. He had heard the

gun shots and sounds of altercations. Fearing for his safety the petitioner had

quickly made his way to Noratel Lanka. Seeing factory workers injured from live

ammunition and tear gas being taken to the First Aid Room of the factory he had

gone there to offer assistance. When he proceeded to report to work the protestors

who were being pursued by the police had started to run in his direction. He had

also run into Noratel International (Pvt) Ltd- New Division for safety and

barricaded the building along with some other workers. The police had

surrounded the building, partially broken the door and three police officers had

entered the building. They had started to assault the workers nearest to the

entrance who happened to be predominantly women. Immediately afterwards the

main entrance to the building had been broken open and several dozen police

officers had entered the building and assaulted those inside. Being assaulted on the

22

back of his head the petitioner had lost consciousness. Though he cannot recall the

incidents that occurred afterwards, he had been informed by his fellow workers

that they had been taken to the Katunayake Police Station in a private van

accompanied by a nurse from Noratel. The petitioner had given his details to the

police-which he does not recall- and then had been taken to the Negombo Base

Hospital where he regained consciousness. Due to the assault he had required

stitches to his nose and the back of the head. A tooth on the right side of the jaw

had also broken. At the time of the application, the petitioner states that due to the

injuries he has difficulty breathing, opening his mouth completely and has reduced

vision in his right eye.

Infringement of the Freedom of Peaceful Assembly

Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution recognizes the freedom of peaceful assembly,

the qualification being the peaceful nature of the assembly. Therefore, even a

protest may be protected under Article 14(1)(b) as long as it remains peaceful. The

jurisprudence of the European Commission of Human Rights is to the effect that

an assembly may be deemed peaceful where the organizers do not intend violence

which results in public disorder. It has been recognized that it is the intention to

hold a peaceful assembly that is significant in determining whether an assembly is

peaceful or not; rather than the likelihood of violence because of the reactions of

other groups or other factors. Violence or disorder that is incidental to the holding

of a peaceful assembly will not remove it from the protection of freedom of

assembly and association. (emphasis added) Christians against Racism and Fascism

v. United Kingdom (No. 8440/78, Commission decision of 16 July 1980, Decisions

and Reports (DR) 21, p. 138)

In Bandara and Others v Jagoda Arachchi, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Fort,

and Others (2000) 1 Sri LR 225 the Supreme Court, setting out a test for

recognizing what maybe considered a peaceful or an unlawful assembly, held that

23

An assembly crosses the line of being peaceful when the general behaviour of

those assembled leads to a reasonable apprehension that they are likely to cause a

disturbance of the public peace, thereby ceasing to enjoy the protection of Article

14(1)(b).

Thus, an assembly of persons can start off as a peaceful assembly with the

organizers intending no violence but later on take an unlawful hue if the general

behavior of the participants leads to a reasonable apprehension that it is likely to

cause a disturbance of the public peace. When a peaceful assembly later takes on

an unlawful hue in the above manner it no longer enjoys the full entitlement to the

freedom of assembly recognized in Article 14(1)(b). In the event of such an

assembly, by the operation of Article 15(7) of the Constitution, it is permissible to

impose such restrictions as may be prescribed by law imposed inter alia in the

interests of... public order.

Since the classification of the assembly in the instant case depends significantly on

its impact on public order, it is useful to distinguish what the term denotes,

especially as opposed to law and order. In Ashok Kumar v Delhi Administration

and Others 1982 AIR 1143, 1982 SCR (3) 707 it has been observed that "The true

distinction between the areas of "public order" and "law and order" lies not in the

nature or quality of the act, but in the degree and extent of its reach upon

societyActs similar in nature but committed in different contexts and

circumstances might cause different reactions. In one case it might affect specific

individuals only and therefore touch the problem of law and order while in

another it might affect public order. The act by itself therefore is not determinant

of its own gravity. It is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even tempo of the

life of the community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance of public

order." (emphasis added) Thus, public order or peace envisages a climate in

which the public can go about their routine of daily activities without unusual

disturbances. Whether an act constitutes a disturbance of the public order or peace

24

depends on the extent of its ability to disrupt the usual pace of daily activities of

the public.

Accordingly, whether the FTZ workers protest created a reasonable apprehension

of acts which have a sufficient potentiality to disturb the usual flow of the daily

activities, must be gauged based on the particular circumstances of the case. The

FTZ is an Industrial Zone managed by the Board of Investment (BOI) which is well-

fortified with all entry points guarded by BOI Security Personnel and the

Katunayake Police. Entry into the FTZ is allowed only to persons granted

permission by the BOI. A protest taking place within the FTZ could disturb the

activities of the factories but not necessarily the public order since the public do

not engage in their daily activities within the zone.

On the 30th, the protest had commenced within the confines of the FTZ near the

vicinity of the factories, with the protestors gradually moving out into the more

open spaces of the FTZ. That in the run up to the charge by the police there were

minor skirmishes taking place between the police and the protestors is a point

conceded by the petitioners. This transformation of the protest and the pelting of

stones combined with the experience of the protest a few days earlier i.e. the 24th

which resulted in the holding up of road and rail traffic culminating in a tear gas

attack and a baton charge would have led the police to form a reasonable

apprehension that the protestors may exit the FTZ and cause havoc outside.

Regarding the alleged attack on the Katunayake Police Station the Presidential

Committee has been of the view that a serious attack where the protestors overran

the police station and caused serious damage to the property is unlikely in the

circumstances. The Committee observes (vide page 15) that the Katunayake Police

Station is situated too far away for the protestors within the FTZ near Gate IV to

cause serious damage by throwing stones especially since the buildings are covered

by trees. The Presidential Committee report expresses the view that had the

protestors entered the Police Station premises, at least 500 Police Officers and 16

25

gazetted Officers had been present there to handle the situation. However, it is

possible that the police officers entertained a fear that the protestors would storm

the Katunayake Police Station when they congregated in large numbers in the

vicinity of Gate IV. Even though a police force of a considerable strength were

present at the scene it has to be appreciated that the protestors too amounted to at

least 4000 in number and that water cannons which could have been effectively

used to keep the protestors at bay and prevent them from spreading out into areas

outside the FTZ were not available. In such a context, it is probable that, the police

harboured a strong apprehension that the protestors would cause a disturbance of

and disruption to the day to day life of the general public if they exited the FTZ.

While these facts and the apprehension renders the protest unlawful, the quelling

of the protest can only be called extreme due to the use of live ammunition and

weapons such as iron rods and nail studded poles. The actions of the Police are by

no means proportionate to the protest even though resorted to for the purpose of

maintaining public order. Therefore, it is an unwarranted move on the part of the

police and not a permissible restriction of Article 14(1)(b).

Justice Sharvananda in his treatise Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka (vide page

267) points out that Without legislative authority, the Executive cannot impose

any restrictions upon any of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 14. It

is only by a law or regulation having statutory force and not by executive or

departmental instructions that a valid restriction on Fundamental Rights can be

imposed. The legal provisions made under Section 95 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act become applicable in respect of the extent of force that can be used

to disperse an unlawful assembly.

Section 95(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 empowers a

police officer not below the rank of Inspector of Police to command an unlawful

assembly which is likely to cause a disturbance of public peace to disperse and

places a duty on the members of such an assembly to disperse upon such command.

26

It however does not allow the police to unleash unbridled power on the assembly

in circumstances where the persons constituting the assembly do not abide by such

duty. Section 95(2) categorically states that the police may lawfully use only such

force as is reasonably necessary to disperse the assembly. (emphasis added)

While what constitutes reasonable force in dispersing an assembly would depend

mostly on the facts of each particular case some general guidelines regarding the

use of force have been identified. Force should be used only where absolutely

necessary and only as a last resort. The degree of force used must be the minimum

required to achieve the lawful objective sought.

Police Departmental Order A19 under B(4) (marked A4) categorically states that

in dispersing a disorderly and riotous crowd Under no circumstances can fire be

opened unless the crowd is committing or attempting to commit any of the offences

contained in the Police Firing Orders. In the present circumstances where the

crowd was not committing or attempting to commit any of those offences there is

no justification for the Police to open fire on the crowd. Committing or attempting

to commit grievous hurt entitles a police officer to open fire on a mob under

B(4)(a) of the Police Departmental Order A19 after considering whether

immediate action is necessary or whether the mere presence of the armed party

will not be sufficient to cause the mob to desist. A careful consideration of the

facts of the case show that that entitlement does not apply here. The 2nd Respondent

states that the protestors had been holding several police officers including a senior

officer to the ground and assaulting them and did not leave even after shots were

fired in the air, compelling him to shoot at the crowd. However, if the events had

transpired in that manner it is not possible that the deceased Roshen Chanaka

would fall at a point well within the FTZ near the Crystal Martin Factory, especially

in a context where Inspector of Police, R. P. K. L. Ranasinghe, the subordinate

officer who fired under the 2nd Respondents orders states that he shot at the

protestors from about 30 meters away (vide page 43, Presidential Committee

27

report). It bears evidence that the Police opened fire on a retreating crowd, which

conclusion is further consolidated by the fact that the Petitioner as well as the

deceased Roshen Chanaka had sustained injuries from shots fired from behind. The

Police Departmental Order (A19) states in no uncertain terms that if any

members of the mob are shot in the back, the police will be accused of firing longer

than necessary. Thus, the second Respondent and his subordinate Inspector of

Police who followed his orders to shoot are liable for using excessive force by

shooting when it was no longer absolutely necessary to do so.

The Respondents contend that the shooting was in exercise of the right of private

defence of Police Officers and Armed Forces provided for by Article 15(8) of the

Constitution in relation to Articles 12(1), 13 and 14. The 2nd Respondent does not

state that he was compelled to shoot as an immediate action in order to ensure his

own safety. Even if the protestors were attacking Police officers, firing as

undertaken here is disproportionate since it is evident that the crowd had been

shot at even after it had started to disperse and that a number of bullets had been

fired above the knee as shown by the injuries above the knee sustained by several

persons. The officers ought to have considered that given the density of the crowd

firing in such a manner may prove fatal to the protestors.

In order to classify the assembly of the FTZ Workers on the 30th of May as unlawful,

it has been submitted by the Respondents that the requirement to give notice of

processions set out in Section 77 of the Police Ordinance has not been complied

with. Section 77 of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865 requires that in case a

procession is to be held, at least 6 hours notice should be given to the Officer-in-

Charge of the Police Station nearest to where the procession is to commence.

Section 77 only requires such notice to be given of processions. Further, the 6

hours notice requirement presumes that the procession is not a spontaneous one.

The evidence which surfaces in the instant case does not support a conclusive

declaration on whether the protest was spontaneous or was organized earlier.

28

The Petitioners state that the protest on the 30th was a spontaneous congregation

of the workers within the FTZ who were seeking to demonstrate their opposition

to the proposed bill. By the 30th the suspicion of the FTZ workers that their views

would not be considered regarding the bill if they did not keep up a protest would

have grown stronger, after the protest organized by the JTUA on the 24th failing to

bear fruit and the meetings with the Minister and several political figures failing

to address their concerns about the bill. The leaflet distribution and poster

campaign would have given rise to the notion, that the government was

determined to pass the bill. Therefore, it is possible that the assembly of the 30th

would have taken place with an element of prior preparation, especially as

supported by the crowd quickly swelling from around 600 to 4000-5000 in

number, and the displaying of placards as stated by the petitioners in their

petitions. S. R. S. Kumari in her Statement to the Presidential Committee (at page

52 of the report) states that there was influence from outside to participate in the

protest. Persons who seemed to be outsiders as indicated from their clothes and

manner of speaking had given contradictory information about the bill and

appeared to be trying to advance the agendas of some outside force. This position

finds backing in the Second Respondents statement where he observed that the

manner of speech and behavior of some of the protestors indicated that they were

not FTZ workers and that while the workers behaved in a disciplined manner the

outsiders used abusive language and acted violently (page 33, Presidential

Committee Report), is not corroborated by the other workers except for the

ambiguous statement by K. Wasantha Kumara Silva;

(at page 54 of the report). Senarath

Rajapakse recalls that workers from other factories came to their gate and

requested them to join the protest and they had joined consequently but does not

mention any influence from an external force (at Page 68 of the report).

29

In Nurettin Aldemir v Turkey (Nos. 32124/02, 32126/02, 32129/02, 32132/02,

32133/02, 32137/02 and 32138/02, 18 December 2007) at Paragraph 34 the

European Court of Human Rights held that interference in meetings held in

opposition to a proposed bill and the force used by the police to disperse the

participants, as well as the subsequent prosecution against the applicants, could

have had a chilling effect and discouraged the applicants from taking part in

similar meetings. Accordingly, it was found to be a violation of Article 11 of the

European Charter of Human Rights. In the present case too the circumstances are

similar and this court is of the opinion that it was a violation of Article 14(1)(b) of

the constitution. The Police has failed to strike an adequate balance between the

right to peaceful assembly and maintaining public order thereby violating the

rights of the petitioner under Article 14(1)(b).

This court in Senasinghe v Karunatilleke, Senior Superintendent of Police,

Nugegoda and Others [2003] 1 Sri L.R has set out forcefully that; The freedom of

peaceful assembly, speech and expression are also designed to promote peace and

order. It, inter alia, assures the freedom to dissent. The process of decision making

in public matters is hereby enriched. If dissent is suppressed there is every

likelihood of it taking a devious form which may ultimately endanger peace and

order. The same has to be reiterated given the trajectory of events marked by the

incidents of the 30th where the police and the workers were caught up in an opaque

climate of confusion heavy with various elements pushing to further their

objectives. The state should ensure that its citizens do not feel that dissent will be

dismissed without due attention in a fair and democratic manner or, will be

suppressed at all costs. More often than not, a protest will get out of hand if the

response of the authorities does not kindle confidence in the protestors and they

feel that they would have no other means of making their views heard or

considered, thus rendering them obsolete. On the other hand, the protestors and

the organizations that give them leadership such as Trade Unions have a duty

incumbent on them to follow the lawful rules and regulations set out in relation to

30

protests, not only for the preservation of public order but for the security of the

protestors themselves. Where a satisfactory resolution to a problem seems distant

and emotions are running high the organizers of a protest should take measures to

ensure that the public tranquility is maintained, and no inconvenience is caused

to the public who are outside the theatre of protests and no disruption is caused to

the public life. This is of paramount importance if they intend to assemble a crowd

over the numbers of which they are unable to exercise sufficient control.

Torture or Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment

It is common ground that around 12 noon on the 30th stones had been thrown and

that tear gas had been used by the Police. The FTZ workers who had remained

within their factories without joining the protest have stated to the Presidential

Committee, that they observed stones being thrown on both sides and that gunshots

were also heard later, a version common to their statements. This version is

plausible when considered together with the 2nd Respondents statement to the

Presidential Committee that he reached the vicinity of Gate IV around 12.55 or

01.00 pm. As he arrived he had been told that DIG Ravi Wijegunawardane and

some other officers were being assaulted by the protestors. Subsequently, he had

shot in the air upon observing that the protestors were attacking a senior Police

officer and other police officers. The 2nd Respondent has stated that since the

protestors did not leave the police officers whom they were holding onto the

ground and attacking, he shot at the crowd without targeting anyone, thereby

causing them to disperse. According to the Confidential Report submitted by the

Attorney General regarding the incident (filed consequent to the Order of the

Court dated 15.11.2011 prior to leave to proceed being granted) 8 persons had

sustained gunshot injuries that day. Inspector of Police R. P. K. L. Ranasinghe, the

other police officer who is accused of shooting, has stated that he fired 4 shots into

the air and 2 shots below the knee upon the orders of his superior, the 2nd

31

Respondent. He however, does not mention that he witnessed police officers being

assaulted by the protestors. In the absence of any affirmation by way of affidavit

by DIG Ravi Wijegunawardane or any other Senior Officer that they were

assaulted by the protestors as described by the 2nd Respondent, it is difficult to

conclusively pronounce that such assaults had in fact taken place. However, given

the climate of confusion and violence that appears to have prevailed and the large

number of protestors, the benefit of the doubt has to be given to the 2nd Respondent.

In shooting at the crowd he has been driven by the need to disperse the crowd and

prevent any further unlawful activities from taking place.

Be that as it may, the police have exceeded the force that they may have lawfully

used, as earlier elaborated in this judgment and also in violation of the Police

Departmental Order A19. Due to the shooting the Petitioner in application

265/2011 sustained severe injuries to his reproductive system and his rectum was

fully injured. The extent of the injuries is such that he has to pass urine and feces

in disposable bags. The gunshot injuries of the victims such as those of the

Petitioner, injuries to the kidneys as sustained by the deceased Roshen Chanaka

and other wounds such as a bullet embedded near the eye of a protestor (vide page

17 of the Presidential Committee report) indicate that the Police opened fire on

persons retreating or fleeing and that the shooting was indeed not below the knee

only. Even if the protestors had been involved in assaulting Police officers, the

actions of the Police are in violation of Departmental Order A19 under B(1) which

states that a crowd must not be punished for an offence already committed and

that force can only be used while the commission of the offense is in progress.

In Amal Sudath Silva v Kodithuwakku 1987 2 SLR 119,127 this court has stated

in relation to Article 11 that It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no

restrictions or limitations whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a

criminal or not, is entitled to this right to the fullest content of its guarantee.

Constitutional safeguards are generally directed against the State and its organs.

32

the Police force, being an organ of state, is enjoined by the Constitution to secure

and advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any manner

and under any circumstances. Just as much this right is enjoyed by every member

of the Police force, so is he prohibited from denying the same to others, irrespective

of their standing, their beliefs or antecedents. The absolute prohibition in Article

11 that no person whatever their conduct shall be subjected to torture or to cruel

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has been violated by the Police

through their violent conduct following the shooting.

The 3rd Respondent in his statement of Objections states that the situation was

brought under control by 2.00pm. According to the statements of the FTZ workers

recorded by the Presidential Committee (vide page 45-74) following the gunshots

there had been an attack by the Police on the factories, which can only be

understood as an attack to punish the workers and intimidate them so as to break

up the protest and prevent any further opposition. The nature of the wounds on

the victims such as injuries to arms, wrists, fingers etc. show that they were

sustained in defending themselves from blows dealt with blunt weapons such as

nail studded poles, iron rods and wooden poles as described by the workers. The

police officers engaged in the attack had worn numberless uniforms,

demonstrating an intention to hide the identities of the assailants. It also shows that

the attack was a planned one.

The words of the police officers ?

? ! (vide page 11 of the

Presidential Committee Report) as recalled by one of the workers who was

assaulted by the Police clearly indicate the intention of the Police officers to punish

the workers for their involvement in the protest. The same worker recalls an

officer with 2 stars saying Now it is enough regardless of which the beating

continued. The statements of the victims of the attack contained in the Presidential

Committee report bear evidence to the deplorable conduct of the Police officers,

33

including women police constables who had come to the scene later on. Assaulting

security officers who attempted to prevent the Police from entering the factories,

hitting pregnant workers and female workers despite pleas for mercy, use of

abusive language, removing belongings of workers such as helmets, three-wheeler

keys and gold chains, causing damage to the property of factories and assaulting

everyone within the factories regardless of whether they were involved in the

protest or not is ample evidence of the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that

was meted out by the Police.

Per the Presidential Committee Report (vide page 22) 268 civilians received

treatment from the Negombo Base Hospital, Ragama Hospital and the Vijaya

Kumaratunga Memorial hospital whereas 29 police officers had been admitted to

hospitals. The number of injured civilians may have been more, since some did not

immediately seek medical assistance for fear of reprisals and others due to

overcrowding of the hospitals. The large number of civilians injured in contrast to

the number of police officers injured point to a brutal crackdown by the police.

The Police had prevented those injured in the shooting and the attack from being

taken to the hospital. The area had been cordoned off and the villagers nearby had

had to break down parapet walls of factories in order to take the injured to

hospitals. The windscreen and shutters of the vehicle into which Roshen Chanaka

was put into had been smashed with iron rods by Police officers, thus delaying the

vehicle. According to the Medico Legal Report the Petitioner, H. M. M. Sampath

Kumara too had been admitted to the Negombo Hospital at 1.57pm, a considerable

delay- given the shooting had occurred between 1-1.30pm- in light of his serious

injuries. Denying of medical treatment has been held to be cruel treatment in

Thomas v Jamaica (Communication No. 321/1988, UN Doc.

CCPR/C/49D321/1988(1993) cited in Somawardena v Superintendent of Prisons

and Others SC App 494/93 Spl SC Minutes 22 March 1995. The deliberate

prevention of timely medical attention to persons with serious gunshot wounds

34

and other wounded persons is a cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment meted out

as punishment.

The mass of evidence corroborated by each of the versions of the petitioners set out

in their respective petitions as well as the statements of their fellow workers

reproduced in the Presidential Committee report is overwhelming in their

testimony of the reprehensible conduct of the police in their attack on the factories.

Arbitrary Arrest

Article 13(1) guarantees that No person shall be arrested except according to

procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason

for his arrest. In Wickremabandu v Herath SC Application 27/88 SC Minutes 6

April 1990 it has been held that Arrest in 13(1) includes an arrest in connection

with an alleged or suspected commission of an offence, as well as any other

deprivation of personal liberty. The petitioners in applications SC FR 268, 270,

271, 272, 273, 274, 346, 347 and 348 who had been detained in the Katunayake

Police Station following the attack of the police on the factories therefore can be

considered as arrestees. The Petitioners were not properly informed of the nature

of the charge or allegation upon which they were arrested as required by Section

23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. They were thus not afforded the

opportunity of removing any mistake, misapprehension or misunderstanding

(vide Mariyadas Raj v Attorney General and Another (1983) 2 SRI L. R. 461) that

they had been engaged in any unlawful activity during the protest. Considering

these circumstances, the rights of the Petitioners under Article 13(1) have been

violated.

The arrests are unlawful in that the police had entered the factory premises by

force, in their pursuit of the protestors fleeing from their charge and then deprived

35

the personal liberty and assaulted workers including the petitioners and others

who had been inside their factories either working or not engaging in the protest.

The detention of the petitioners in applications SC FR 268, 270, 271, 272, 273,

274, 346, 347 and 348 in the Police Cell and in a room in the Crime Branch at the

Katunayake Police Station amounts to arbitrary detention.

Violation of Article 12(1)

Equality before law and the equal protection of the law guaranteed to all persons

by Article 12(1) has been violated by the arbitrary exercise of power by the Police.

In Sanghadasa Silva v Anuruddha Ratwatte 1998 1 SLR p250 it was stated that it

is now well settled law that powers vested in the state, public officers and public

authorities are not absolute and unfettered but are held in trust for the people to

be used for the public benefit and not for improper purposes. Even though Police

officers are charged with the duty of maintaining law and order they cannot

exercise the power granted for that purpose in a manner that negates the equality

provision. Regardless of the fact that the workers may have joined in the protests

and engaged in unlawful activity their entitlement to the protection of the law does

not diminish.

Conduct of the Senior Officers

When one considers the events that had taken place immediately prior to the

incidents that led to police action on this occasion, it is quite evident that the

tension among the FTZ workers was simmering over a period of time. Thus, it could

be reasonably deduced that the authorities would have entertained the

apprehension that the situation could get unruly or lead to violence as it turned

out to be, in the instant case. I am of the view that the state, as the guardian of the

36

fundamental rights, has a duty to take every precautionary step in ensuring that a

riotous situation is quelled with minimum damage both to human lives and

property. It was no secret that the FTZ is populated with a sizeable worker

community and authorities were put on notice that the days immediately prior,

they were emotionally disturbed due to the apprehension that their retirement

benefits will be adversely affected as a result of the Bill that was proposed to be

legislated. Correctness or otherwise of that apprehension apart, the law

enforcement authorities ought to have foreseen the events that unraveled. Thus,

derive the duty on their part to take the adequate steps to meet the situation. The

manner in which the law enforcement authorities have acted in this instance

cannot be complimented and the conduct of the Senior Officers of the law

enforcement in the events referred to falls short of foresight and the diligence

expected of them. It is needless to stress that using live ammunition to quell a

worker protest ought to have been the last resort after exhausting all other

practices normally deployed in a situation of this nature. For example, had water

cannons been stationed at the site of the protest the Police Officers would not have

had to fear that they would be helpless if the crowd exited the FTZ and caused

havoc outside and therefore use fatal measures. The 2nd Respondent in his

statement to the Presidential Committee observes that had water cannons and

adequate riot squads been available the situation could have been easily brought

under control. The second respondent in his statement to the Presidential

Committee (vide page 38) has stated that when he arrived at the Katunayake Police

Station and the vicinity of Gate IV and that there were no senior officers to issue

orders to them and that he took the decision to fire. The inaction and the failure of

the Senior Officers to issue proper orders has only aggravated the situation. The

IGP states that two trained Riot Squads were placed at the two exit gates of the FTZ,

a number clearly insufficient, as indicated by the turn of events where officers not

specially trained for handling crowds dealt with the protestors, with grave

consequences.

37

A particular Notice to all employees produced in the Presidential Committee

report (vide page 18) refer to the IGPs views on the demonstrations on the 24th -

they were unhappy about the unlawful assembly and violation of law and order

due to the actions taken by the workers on the 24th May at 18th Mile Post,

Katunayake. Further he expressed that repetition of such unlawful actions will not

be tolerated in the future. This view that the protestors right to demonstrate their

opposition to the bill extends only to an arbitrary extent that the Police thinks

acceptable and not to the full extent guaranteed by the Constitution and, any action

in excess can be quelled mercilessly appears to be the general attitude of the Police

towards the protestors as later manifested in the violence they unleashed against

them.

In Sanjeewa, Attorney-at-Law on behalf of Gerald Mervyn Perera v Suraweera

[2003] 1 Sri LR 317 SC The duty imposed by Article 4(d) to respect, secure and

advance fundamental rights...extends to all organs of Government and the Head of

the Police (The Inspector General of Police) can claim no exemptionA prolonged

failure to give effective directions designed to prevent violations of Article 11, and

to ensure the proper investigation of those which nevertheless take place followed

by disciplinary or criminal proceedings, may well justify the inference of

acquiescence and condonation if not also of approval and authorization.

State Liability

Per Amerasinghe. J. in Saman v Leeladasa (1989) 1 SLR 1 The test of liability

relates to the performance or purported performance of his official duties and not

to his rank or position in the official hierarchy. If the act was done within the scope

of the express or implied sense of the authority of the public officer concerned,

there is executive or administrative action in the relevant senseWhere there is

no express or implied, authority, the act of the public officer may nevertheless be

regarded as executive or administrative action if it could be inferred from the

38

circumstances-that the act was done with the intention of doing good to the State

and not for his own purpose. In such a case of ostensible authority it may be no

defence that the officer concerned was acting beyond his power or authority and

even in disregard of a prohibition or special direction provided, of course, that the

act was incidental to what the officer was employed to do. It follows from this

view that the state with which the primary duty to safeguard fundamental rights

enshrined in the Constitution lies, is liable for the inaction of the Respondents.

Since the identities of the police officers who perpetrated the concerted charge and

the subsequent attack on the factories have not been specifically identified, it is not

possible to pin individual liability on individual officers.

Declarations and Compensation

Upon consideration of the material placed before the court, I am of the view that

the Petitioners have established that their fundamental rights have been violated

and each of the Petitioners is entitled to a declaration to that effect;

Accordingly, I declare that the fundamental rights of

a) H. M. M. Sampath Kumara, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(b) had been

violated (SC FR 265/2011)

b) A. Rohitha Amarasinghe, under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 14(1)(b) had

been violated (SC FR 266/2011)

c) C. A. H. M. O. Buddika Atapattu, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(b) had

been violated (SC FR 267/2011)

d) R. R. M. Dhanushka Sanjeewa, under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 14(1)(b)

had been violated (SC FR 268/2011)

e) Anesh Imalka Fernando, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(b) had been

violated (SC FR 269/2011)

39

f) N. L. T. Iresha, under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 14(1)(b) had been

violated (SC FR 270/2011)

g) Nisshanka Wanigasekera, under Articles 11 and12(1) had been violated (SC

FR 271/2011)

h) R. A. H. M. Jayatissa Rajakaruna, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) had

been violated (SC FR 272/2011)

i) S. P. L Ranjan Lasantha Perera, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) had been

violated (SC FR 273/2011)

j) H. M. Lalinda Herath, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) had been violated

(SC FR 274/2011)

k) M. Pradeep Kumara Priyadarshana, under Articles 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(b)

had been violated (SC FR 346/2011)

m) M. H. A. Sameera Sandaruwan Hettiarachchi, under Articles 11, 12(1) and

14(1)(b) had been violated (SC FR 348/2011)

I am of the view that this is a fit matter to consider payment of compensation to

the Petitioners. In deciding the quantum of compensation to be awarded the court

took into consideration the gravity of the injuries sustained by the Petitioners and

the court also took in consideration that some of the petitioners have not taken part

in the protest but are victims of circumstances. Accordingly;

a) In SC FR Application No. 265/2011 the Petitioner H. M. M. Sampath

Kumara is awarded a sum of Rs. 250,000 as compensation.

is awarded Rs.75,000 as Compensation.

Sanjeewa is awarded Rs. 50,000 as compensation.

e) In SC FR Application No. 269/2011 the Petitioner Anesh Imalka Fernando is

awarded Rs. 50,000 as compensation.

Rs.75,000 as compensation.

is awarded Rs. 100,000 as compensation.

Rajakaruna is awarded Rs. 75,000 as compensation.

Perera is awarded Rs. 100,000 as compensation.

j) In SC FR Application No. 274/2011 the Petitioner H. M. Lalinda Herath is

awarded as Rs. 40,000 as compensation.

k) In SC FR Application No. 346/2011 the Petitioner M. Pradeep Kumara

Priyadarshana is awarded Rs. 75,000 as compensation.

State.
