The parties in FR 119/2019, 121/2019, 122/2019, 123/2019, 124/2019, 125/2019, 126/2019,

127/2019, 128/2019, 129/2019, 130/2019, 132/2019, 133/2019, 134/2019, 137/2019 agreed to

abide by this judgement. Therefore, this judgement has the binding effect in all the said cases.

The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court, alleging the violation of her fundamental

rights guaranteed under the Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (g) of the Constitution. Further, the

Petitioner alleged that, the acts, omissions and decisions of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents are

3

ultra vires to the provisions of the Medical Ordinance, and that such acts and omissions are

arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and amount to a violation of the principles of reasonableness,

fairness, proportionality, legitimate expectation and natural justice.

The Petitioner is a graduate of the Odessa National Medical University, Ukraine which has

been recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council for the purposes of provisional registration

under the Medical Ordinance. She made an application to the Sri Lanka Medical Council

(Hereinafter sometimes called as the 1st Respondent) for approval to sit for the Examination

for Registration to practise Medicine (Hereinafter sometimes called as the ‘EPRM’).The

approval was granted on 30th September 2016 and the Petitioner passed the examination. The

Petitioner’s contention is that, the 1st Respondent has initially recognized that she has all the

required qualifications to sit the EPRM. The Petitioner has passed all the stages of the EPRM

and is placed 51st on the foreign graduates’ merit list and 128th on the common merit list. Her

attempts to obtain a copy of the common merit list were of no avail and unsuccessful. The

Petitioner states that, she has applied for provisional registration under Section 29 (2) of the

Medical Ordinance and the issue of the EPRM completion certificate. As per the petition, The

1st Respondent has not taken steps to provisionally register the Petitioner citing the purported

ground that she has not fulfilled a pre-entry qualification relating to Advanced Level results

said to have been imposed by the document marked 1R imposed by the former. Subsequently,

the Petitioner has made an application for the internship, but it was rejected by the Ministry of

Health on the basis that, there is no provisional registration number granted by the Sri Lanka

Medical Council. On 6th of February 2019, the Registrar of the Sri Lanka Medical Council has

informed the Petitioner that, no decision has been taken to register her provisionally. The

Petitioner’s contention is that, being a citizen of Sri Lanka she bears a good character and holds

a degree in Medicine which has been recognized by the 1st Respondent, and there is an

obligation on the part of the 1St Respondent to provisionally register her as a medical

practitioner under and in terms of Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance.

The 1st Respondent’s contention is that, it has the sole authority and power to decide on the

criteria for the recognition of universities or medical schools of any country by considering the

standard of medical education of such universities or medical schools, and has the authority to

introduce changes to such criteria and / or subjecting previously imposed criteria to additional

qualifications at a subsequent stage. As per the contention of the 1st Respondent, it considers

the standards in relation to the recognition, as at the date of submission of the application for

4

provisional registration under Section 29 (2) by any person. The pre entry qualification said to

have been imposed by the 1st Respondent and set out in the Document marked in 1R specifies

that, the medical students admitted to the medical schools shall have three passes in Biology,

Chemistry and Physics / Mathematics with at least two credit passes in those subjects at the

G.C.E. A/L or an equivalent examination approved by the Sri Lanka Medical Council prior the

entry to the Medical school. The 1st Respondent further states that, pre-entry qualification

requirement is stated in a document made available to the public. However, the Petitioner

entered the Odessa University before 1R1 came into force. Before the newly imposed pre entry

qualification set out in the circular, the minimum qualification to register at any recognized

foreign university was the same as the minimum A/L qualification required for the admission

to any other state university of Sri Lanka and does not require the credit passes. As per the

contention of the 1st Respondent, it has acted within its powers and scrutinized the A/L

qualifications of the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent further states that, the Petitioner has failed

to promptly disclose her alleged pre entry disqualification and taken an inordinate period to

complete the degree and pass the EPRM and thereby breached the standards of intelligence and

enthusiasm necessary for the medical profession.

The Medical Ordinance, by its Section 29 describes the Registration of Medical Practitioners.

The Section 29 (1) (a) and Section 29 (1) (b) (ii) of the Medical Ordinance read as follows:

A person shall, upon application made in that behalf to the Medical Council,

be registered as a medical practitioner,

a) If he is of good character: and

b) If he

(i) ......

(ii) Not being qualified to be registered under paragraph (i)

(aa) is a citizen of Sri Lanka,

(bb) holds a degree of Bachelor of Medicine or equivalent qualifications of

any university or medical school of any country other than Sri Lanka, which

is recognized by the, Medical Council for the purposes of this section having

regard to the standard of medical education of such university or medical

school.

5

cc) has passed the Special examination prescribed in that behalf by the

Medical Council.

dd) holds a certificate granted by the Medical Council under section 32.

The Section 29 (2) (b) (iii) (i) (cc) states as follows,

(2) For the purposes only of enabling the acquirement of such experiences as

is required for obtaining from the Medical Council. a certificate under

Section 32, a person shall, upon application made in that behalf to the

Medical Council, be registered provisionally as a, medical practitioner,

(a) if he is of good character,

(b) if he,

( i) holds a degree of Bachelor of Medicine of the University of Ceylon

or a corresponding university or a Degree Awarding Institute or

General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University: or

ii) has passed the examination necessary for obtaining a degree of

Bachelor of Medicine of the University of Ceylon or a

corresponding university or of a Degree Awarding Institute, but has

not obtained that degree owing to a delay on the part of the

university or the Degree Awarding Institute or General Sir John

Kotelawala Defence University in conferring that degree on him,

(iii) not being qualified to be registered under any of the preceding sub-

paragraphs.

(aa) is a citizen of Sri Lanka;

(bb)

(i) holds a degree of Bachelor of Medicine or an equivalent

qualification of any university or, medical school of any country

other than Sri Lanka, which is recognised by the, Medical council

for the purposes of this section having regard to the standard of

medical education of such university or medical school or,

6

(ii) has passed the examination necessary for obtaining a degree of

Bachelor of Medicine or an equivalent qualification of any

university or medical school of any country other than Sri Lanka

which is recognized by the Medical Council for the purposes of this

section, having regard to the standard of medical education at such

university or medical school but has not obtained that degree owing

to the fact that, he has not completed the period of internship

required for obtaining that degree and the Director – General of

Health Service has permitted him to compete that period of

internship in Sri Lanka,

(cc) has passed the special examination prescribed in that behalf by the

Medical Council.

Upon a perusal of the law applicable to the case, it is clear that, in the case of the Petitioners

the provisional registration as a medical practitioner in Sri Lanka under Section 29 (2) of the

Medical Ordinance is grounded on two basic requirements namely:

1) The relevant person applying for provisional registration must possess a

Bachelor’s Degree in Medicine from any recognized university or medical

school of a country other than Sri Lanka. The university must be a

recognized university by the Medical Council of Sri Lanka having regard

to the standard of medical education.

2) That person should have passed the special examination provided by the

SLMC.

In the case of the Petitioner, it is evident that the university she attended is a foreign university

which has been recognized by the 1st Respondent and that she has passed the EPRM. The

conduct of the 1st Respondent of recognizing the University of the Petitioner itself is a fact

which shows that, the 1st Respondent cannot deny the entitlement of the Petitioner for

provisional registration. The 1st Respondent has recognized the aforesaid university as an

institution which provides a standard medical education, which would entitle a graduate to be

7

recognized as a medical practitioner in Sri Lanka. I see that, the 1st Respondent is estopped

from imposing a different and unjustifiable pre requirement subsequently.

The Medical Ordinance is a “law enacted by the Parliament”. A law enacted by the Parliament

is of significant value, for two reasons. In one perspective, a law enacted by the parliament has

a power to organize the society and in the other way, it protects the citizens. The sanctity of a

law enacted by the Parliament is at the zenith. The 1st Respondent is not empowered to and

impose rules, which override an enactment which has been passed by the Parliament.

Under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance, a citizen of Sri Lanka who is of a good character

and has a degree in medical education from a university recognized by the Medical Counsel is

entitle to sit for the EPRM and on obtaining pass marks, become entitled to provisional

registration. Pre entry requirement to the university is not a qualification specified by the

Parliament as a pre requisite for provisional registration. Therefore, any other authority, like

Medical Council, cannot bring in such a requirement, it can only recognize or not recognize a

foreign university or medical school. It is overriding the power or authority of the Legislature.

If the Parliament says that certain requirements are necessary to do a certain thing, other

administrative authorities are expected to follow the rule.

Kandiah v.Abeykoon (Sri Skantha Law Reports Volume IV, pg 96,

‘Upon the construction of a statute as a whole, the forms of notice,

application and affidavit had to be in strict compliance with those which the

legislature has thought important enough to set out in the schedules before

the jurisdiction of the magistrate to eject the person in possession or

occupation could be exercised’.

This court upholds compliance with the law enacted by the Parliament and the 1st Respondent

has acted arbitrarily by subsequently imposing a pre entry qualification as a requirement for

the provisional registration. John Quincy Adams, An American Lawyer has stated that, ‘Nip

the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim that protect the liberties of any

people’. (‘Companion to the cantos of Erza Pound’, by Caroll F.Terrell Pg.314).

8

This court being the apex court of the country upholds the tenets of rule of law. The court

accepts the absolute predominance of the ordinary law of the land. A law enacted by the

Parliament as the supreme Legislative organ cannot be overridden by a regulation which has

been arbitrarily made by a subordinate authority. Such a regulation which has arbitrarily been

enacted shall not have a retrospective effect. I hereby quote and uphold the view of Thomas

Hardiman, as a judge in the United States. (‘A look at Thomas Hardiman, Possible Trump

Scotus Nominee’, by Mitchelle Gorman).

‘In the legislative branch, you make the laws....and our role as judges is to

interpret the law, not to inject our own policy preferences. So our task is to

give an honest construction to what laws are passed by the Legislature.’

The recognition of a university or a medical school is entirely within the purview of the

Medical Council of Sri Lanka. If the 1st Respondent is of the view that a university or a medical

school is giving admission to persons who are not qualified to study a medicine, it is for the

Medical Council to re consider the recognition of the said university. The entry qualification

to the university is a matter for the said university.

The Medical Ordinance, being the statutory law has not imposed a restriction on the Petitioner

following a degree in Medicine of her choice with a view to qualifying as a medical practitioner

subject to the requirement that the 1st Respondent must have recognized the said university.

The university that the Petitioner studied medicine was a university recognized by the 1st

Respondent. It has been mentioned in the list of universities that it had been recognized without

any condition or limitation. Relying on that assurance, the Petitioner entered in the said

university and obtained a degree of medicine.

The 1st Respondent’s subsequent imposition of an alleged pre entry qualification to the

university is now held out by the 1st Respondent as the alleged reason for denying the Petitioner

provisional registration. The 1st Respondent has attempted to act in contrary to the existing law

enacted by the Parliament. Thus, it is clear that, the 1st Respondent has exceeded the powers

within its purview. The 1st Respondent is authorized to make rules in the instances where

necessary, but no authority has been granted power to override a law enacted by the Parliament.

Further, the 1st Respondent cannot expect that, the rules imposed by it can operate

retrospectively to thrust a burden on the Petitioner whose qualifications for provisional

registration met with the existing law at the time of entering the university prior to the

arbitrarily imposition of the alleged pre entry qualification.

9

This court sees that there is a legitimate expectation on the side of the Petitioner, to have

recognition as a qualified person to be entitled to the provisional registration (subject to

obtaining pass marks in EPRM). The Petitioner had the expectation that, she is stepping in to

a university, which is recognized by the 1st Respondent and afterwards, the 1st Respondent

himself imposes a pre entry qualification which ultimately left the Petitioner with utmost

desperation as to her future.

The doctrine of legitimate expectation is basically aimed at the prevention of administrative

authorities from abusing their discretionary powers against the legitimate expectations of

individuals, which have been engineered by the prior conduct of the authorities. The Petitioner

has studied in a university which has been duly recognized by the 1st Respondent. It is evident

that, the 1st Respondent’s act of recognizing the university has engineered a legitimate

expectation of the Petitioner. The legitimate expectation of a person ensures that, the

administrative authorities are bound by their undertakings and assurances unless there are

compelling reasons to change the policy subsequently. It further ensures legal certainty which

is imperative as the people ought to plan their lives, secure in the knowledge of the

consequences of their actions. The perception of legal certainty deserves protection, as a basic

tenet of the rule of law which this court attempts to uphold as the apex court of the country.

The public perception of legal certainty becomes negative when the authorities by their own

undertakings and assurances have generated legitimate expectations of people and

subsequently by their own conduct, infringe the so generated expectations.

Lord Denning has stated that, (in “Recent Development in the Doctrine of consideration’’) ‘A

man should keep his words. All the more so when promise is not a bare promise but is made

with the intention that the other party should act upon it’. The principle of legitimate

expectation is connected with an administrative authority and an individual. It emerges in an

instance where an administrative authority affects a person by depriving him of some benefit

or an advantage which he had been in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy

and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue. Thus as an essence,

administrative authority must respect the expectations.

There are essential ingredients of legitimate expectation. Some are:

a) The doctrine imposes a duty on the administrative body to afford an opportunity of

hearing to the affected party, before acting contrary to the latter’s legitimate

expectation.

10

b) The doctrine extends the protection of natural justice or fairness to the exercise of non

statutory administrative powers where the interest affected is only an expectation, a

privilege or a benefit.

c) The doctrine applies to make a public authority’s decision making process fair.

d) A person may derive the legitimate expectation of receiving a benefit or privilege as a

matter of public law even where that person has no legal right to it.

e) An individual can claim a benefit or privilege under the doctrine of legitimate

expectation only when such expectation is reasonable.

f) The doctrine extends to the exercise of non statutory powers.

g) The doctrine of legitimate expectation would arise from an express promise or existence

of a regular practice.

In Wickremaratne v. Jayarathne [2001] 3 Sri L R 161, Justice Gunawardena held that,

“The doctrine of legitimate expectation is not limited to cases involving a

legitimate expectation of a hearing before some right or expectation was

affected, but is also extended to situations even where no right to be heard

was available or existed but fairness required a public body or official to act

in compliance with its public undertakings and assurances. Simon Brown LJ

explained this aspect in R. v. Devon Country Council, ex parts Baker and

another in which the concept of legitimate expectation was used to refer to

the fair procedure itself i.e. that the applicant claims to have a legitimate

expectation that public authority will act fairly towards him. It is not

procedurally fair for the State to have promised the petitioner an extent of

land 2RR 21 PP in extent upon his surrendering the balance land and then

proceed to acquire the whole of the land without the petitioner being given

any opportunity to make representations.”

As De Smith elaborated in ‘Judicial Review of Administrative Action’ 5th Edition:

‘The protection of legitimate expectations is at the root of the constitutional

principle of rule of the law, which requires regularity, predictability, and

certainty in government’s dealing with the public’

11

The administrative authorities are empowered to meet the challenging needs of the society.

It is appropriate to quote the perception of Justice C.G.Weeramantry, in his work ‘An

Invitation to Law’ at page 139,

“No legal system achieves greatness unless it has within it a built in

mechanism for adapting that legal system to change. Society is ever changing

and as new circumstances arise, attitudes and moral standards change as

well. If the legal system remains frozen and unalterable, there will sooner or

later be a wild gulf between this system and the needs of the society’’

As the apex court of the country, this court encourages the flexibility and adaptability of the

administrative authorities in making policies and taking decisions, but still, insists on the fact

that such conduct should not be used unfair and arbitrary. As the 1st Respondent states, it has

powers to impose requirements on the subject of the recognition of foreign universities and

medical schools. However, such powers should not be unfair and arbitrarily to deprive ones’

rights. The main function of this court in this type of case is to strike a balance between

ensuring an administrative authority’s ability to change its policies when required, and make

sure that in doing so they do not defeat the legitimate expectations of individuals by acting

unfairly and arbitrarily.

Justice Sedley held in R v. MAFF (ex) P. Hamble (Offshore fisheries) 1995 2 All ER 714, that,

“Legitimacy in this sense is not an absolute. It’s a function of expectations

induced by government and of policy considerations which militate against

their fulfilment. The balance must in the first instance, be for the policy maker

to strike; but if the outcome is challenged by way of a judicial review, I do

not consider that the court’s criterion is the bare rationality of the policy

maker’s conclusion. While policy is for the policy maker alone, the fairness

of his or her decision not to accommodate reasonable expectations which the

policy will thwart remains the court’s concern (as of course the lawfulness

of the policy). ….. The court’s task is to recognize the constitutional

importance of ministerial freedom to formulate and reformulate the policy,

but it is equally the court’s duty, to protect the interest of those individuals

whose expectation of different treatment has legitimacy in which in fairness

out tops policy choice which threatens to frustrate it.’’

12

The same view which the Justice Sedley observed was held by Justice A.R.B Amarasinghe, in

Dayarathne and Others v. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Others [1999] 1 Sri

L R 393,

“Evidently, there had been a change of policy. In my view, although the

executive ought not in the exercise of its discretion, to be restricted so as to

hamper or prevent the change of policy, yet it is not entirely free to overlook

the existence of a legitimate expectation. Each case must depend on its

circumstances, but eventually it seems to me, that the court’s delicate and

sensitive task is one of weighing genuine public interest against private

interests and deciding on the legitimacy of an expectation, having regard to

the weight it carries, in the face of the need for a policy change’’.

It is clear that, the legitimacy of an expectation emerges when it is lawful and proper. The

Petitioner is a graduate who has sacrificed a considerable period of her lifetime for the medical

education and it is evident that, she has a significant anticipation for her future as a medical

practitioner. This court sees the dedication on the part of the Petitioner.

The legitimate or reasonable expectation arises from an express promise given on behalf of a

public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably

expect to continue. This court decides that, the expectation which is defined in the domain of

this doctrine is not merely an anticipation. It is not just a wish, desire, hope, a claim or any kind

of a demand. The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred, if it is founded on the sanction

of a law or custom or assurance or an established procedure by a public authority. It was stated

in Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation (1993) SCC 499 at 540, that,

‘Such expectation should be justifiably legitimate and protectable. Every such

legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a right and therefore it does

not amount to a right in the conventional sense.’

It is evident from the circumstances of the case, that the Petitioner had a legitimate and

protectable expectation to be provisionally registered under Section 29 (2). Medical Education

is a sacrifice of 5 or more years in the life of a person which cannot be replaced and will be

wasted if the legitimate expectation of being provisionally registered as a medical practitioner

is not realized. In this instance I bring forth a quote from Jean Piaget, a psychologist on the

concept of Education (‘conquering criticism’ by Pravin Bhatia at pg. 143) said.

13

‘The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create

the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable

of doing new things.’

This perception can be applied to the instance of ‘Medical Education’ as well. The purpose of

medical education is not the mere increase of knowledge and the skills of the respective

students, but it is to apply such knowledge for the betterment of the field. The Petitioner, who

has been denied provisional registration, has knowledge but he/she is being deprived of

opportunity to put her talent, capacity and knowledge in to practice. Prior to the conclusion of

the case, I quote a statement by Lord Hodge on the constitutional basis of the doctrine of

legitimate expectation, in Rainbow Insurance Company Ltd v. Financial Services Commission

(Mauritius) [2015]UKPC 15,

‘The courts have developed the principle of legitimate expectation as part of

administrative law to protect persons from gross unfairness or abuse of power by a

public authority. The constitutional principle of the rule of law underpins the

protection of legitimate expectations as it prohibits the arbitrary use of power by

public authorities.’

This court cannot reject the legitimate expectation on the part of the Petitioner, which is

protectable. The 1st Respondent has exceeded its authority and has acted unfairly and

arbitrarily and thereby infringed the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under the

Articles 12(1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents have similarly

violated the aforesaid fundamental rights of the Petitioner by their acts and conduct.

Considering the above circumstances, this court decides that, the Petitioner’s fundamental

rights guaranteed under the Article 12 (1) and 14(1) (g) of the Constitution have been infringed

by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents. The court directs the 1st Respondent to provisionally

register the Petitioner under the provisions of the Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance, as

prayed for in prayer (g) of the petition. Further, the Court makes Order in terms of prayer (h)

of the petition, which is to be implemented if the 1st Respondent fail to grant provisional

registration under Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance to Petitioner within 30 days of this

judgement.

The Petitioners in the cases mentioned at the beginning of this judgment are also entitled to

the same relief. The Petitioners who were denied the provisional registration and those who

were not allowed to complete the ERPM due to the fact that, they are not having the

14

subsequently imposed pre entry requirement prior to entering the recognized universities,

shall be given provisional registration or be allowed to sit for the ERPM respectively.
