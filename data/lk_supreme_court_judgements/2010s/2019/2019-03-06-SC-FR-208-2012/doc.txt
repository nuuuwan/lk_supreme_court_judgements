Sisira J de Abrew

The Petitioner complains that his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 11,

12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents. This court by its order dated 13.9.2012, granted leave to proceed for

alleged violation of Article 11 of the Constitution. The facts of this case may be

briefly summarized as follows.

The Petitioner is a sanitary labourer attached to Sevanagala Divisional Hospital.

The Petitioner states that on 3.2.2012, the 3rd Respondent who is the Medical

Officer-in-Charge of the said hospital called the Petitioner to staff rest room; that

the 3rd Respondent questioned the Petitioner about the poisoning of the Water tank

of him (the 3rd Respondent); and that thereafter the 3rd Respondent assaulted him

with a rubber pipe. The Petitioner sustained injuries. The Judicial Medical officer

(JMO) who examined the Petitioner on 4.12.2012 observed five contusions on the

right upper arm, back of the chest and right buttock of the Petitioner. The JMO in

3

his report states that the injuries have been caused within two to three days from

the date of examination.

The 3rd Respondent in his affidavit dated 19.3.2013 states that when he questioned

the Petitioner regarding poisoning of the water tank of his official quarters, he

admitted the poisoning of the water tank; that he assaulted the Petitioner with a

conduit pipe due to provocation and loss of self control. Learned SSC tried to

contend that the assault by the 3rd Respondent on the Petitioner could not be

considered as torture. When considering this contention Article 11 of the

Constitution should be considered. It reads as follows.

“No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment.”

In WMK de Silva Vs Chairman of Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation [1989] 2 SLR 393 Amerasinghe J held as follows.

"In my view Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits any act by which severe

pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is, without lawful sanction in

accordance with a procedure established by law, intentionally inflicted on a

person (whom I shall refer to as the victim ) by a public official acting in the

discharge of his executive or administrative duties or under colour of office,

for such purposes as obtaining from the victim or a third person a

confession or information, such information being actually or supposedly

required for official purposes, imposing a penalty upon the victim for an

offence or breach of a rule he or a third person has committed or is

suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing the victim or a

third person to do or refrain from doing something which the official

4

concerned believes the victim or the third person ought to do or refrain from

doing, as the case may be."

The JMO confirms in his report that that the Petitioner had sustained five

contusions and that they could have been caused by a flexible rubber pipe within

two to three days prior to the date of examination. The date of examination had

been on 4.2.2012. The alleged incident according to the Petitioner was on

3.2.2012. When I consider the above facts and the above mentioned legal

literature, I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned SSC.

The learned SSC further contended that the allegation of torture on the Petitioner

has not been proved with high degree of certainty. In Channa Peiris and Others Vs

Attorney General [1994] 1SLR 1 this court held as follows.

In regard to violations of Article 11 (by torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), three general observations apply:

(i) The acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that

a Court may take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not declare that Article 11 has been violated. (ii) Torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may

take many forms, psychological and physical.

(iii) Having regard to the nature and gravity of the issue, a high degree of

certainty is required before the balance of probability might be said to tilt in favour of a petitioner endeavouring to discharge his burden of proving that he was subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

The 3rd Respondent in his affidavit filed in this court has admitted that he assaulted

the Petitioner with a conduit pipe. When I consider the aforementioned matters, I

5

hold that the assault on the Petitioner has been proved with high degree of

certainty. The 3rd Respondent is the Medical Officer in Charge of Sevanagala

Divisional Hospital and the Petitioner is a Sanitary Labourer attached to the said

hospital. When I consider facts of this case, I hold that the Petitioner was subjected

to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the 3rd Respondent and the

3rd Respondent has violated fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by

Article 11 of the Constitution. The Petitioner is entitled to receive a sum of

Rs.50,000/- as compensation from the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent is

directed to pay the above amount within three months from the date of this

judgment.
