Aluwihare PC. J.,

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Plaintiff),

instituted the original action in the High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo on 1st July 2005, claiming damages amounting to Rs. 8, 005, 536.88

with legal interest from the Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as Defendant) for breach of contract.

On 3rd August 1999, the Defendant entered into an Agreement with the

Commissioner General of the Department of Educational Publications in the

Ministry of Education (hereinafter Commissioner General) to print the

following school text books;

(). . In terms of the Agreement, the Defendant agreed to print 380,000 copies of the

book World Through English for Rs. 14, 568, 321/= and to deliver the said

copies to the Commissioner General of the Department of Educational

Publications on or before 30. 11. 1999. The said book consisted of 160 pages and

was a given a unit price of Rs. 38.34/=. However, the Commissioner General

subsequently reduced the number of pages to 136 and the Defendant-Appellant

agreed to print the same number of copies taking Rs. 32.58/= as the new unit

price.

It is the contention of the Plaintiff that the Defendant failed to meet the deadline

and complete the order. The Defendant had only succeeded in printing 120, 400

copies and even those copies had been delivered past the deadline. As a result of

the default, the Commissioner General was compelled to commission three other

printing agencies to print the remainder.

Orders had been placed with Wishwalekha Printers, AJ printers and

Samayawardhana printers to print respectively, 100, 000 copies (Rs. 71.55/= per

copy), 49, 910 copies (Rs. 69.25/= per copy) and 50, 000 copies (Rs. 78.07/=

per copy) of the text book. The total cost incurred to print the remaining copies

amounted to Rs. 8, 005, 536. 00. The final receipts and invoices pertaining to

each order are marked from P2 P7.

Exercising rights stipulated in clauses (15), (21) and (23) of the Agreement, the

Commissioner General, on behalf of the State, sought to recover the aforesaid Rs.

5

8, 005, 536. 00 from the Defendant by way of a letter of demand, as it was the

Defendants default that caused additional expenses. Having failed to secure the

recovery by way of a letter of demand, the Attorney General instituted action in

the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo.

The matter proceeded to trial on 15 issues raised on behalf of the Plaintiff-

Respondent. The Defendant-Appellant, however, did not raise any issues.

Case for the Plaintiff was presented through the witness Wasantha Kumara

Perera, Commissioner (Finance) of the Educational Publications Department and

the documents P1 to P10 were marked and produced through this witness.

The Defendant, in their written submissions filed before this court had conceded

that the Defendant did not challenge the documents marked and produced as

P2 to P9.

The Manager of the Defendant Company (K. A. A. V. Nishantha) and the

Accountant of the Company (L. D. S. Wickrama), testified on behalf of the

Defendant and produced the documents D1 to D3. The Learned High Court

Judge in delivering the judgement, answered all issues raised in favour of the

Plaintiff.

The learned counsel for the Defendant submitted that the facts are not in dispute,

however, he stated that he only wishes to canvass the conclusions reached by the

learned trial Judge. As such, I do not wish to dwell on the facts in detail.

At the trial, the Defendant contended that the Agreement was terminated by

mutual consent and not pursuant to a breach. According to their version, a

consensus was reached between the Commissioner General and the Defendant to

terminate the contract and hand over the Art work, Positive and Press copy to the

Commissioner General. However, evidence explaining reasons for such

consensus, or the purported consensual termination has not been led before the

High Court. Instead, the Defendant had sought to establish their position relying

6

on Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure wherein it is stated that a party

will not be entitled to receive final payment until the completion of the contract.

They have marked the final invoice sent to the Commissioner General dated 26.

07. 2000 (marked V1) and have contended that they would not have received

the final payment if they, as alleged, were in breach of the contract.

By the same token, they have pointed out that the Commissioner General has not

taken any steps to blacklist them as a defaulting contractor in terms of the said

Guidelineswhich, according to them, reinforce the contention that there was no

breach of contract. Additionally, they have also referred to the fact that the

Plaintiff had not taken steps to appropriate the security bond given as Guarantee

to the Agreement, further adding weight to the fact that no breach had taken

place. The gravamen of the submission of the learned counsel for the Defendant

was that, the learned trial Judge was in error in not considering the totality of the

evidence led in the correct perspective, and if the learned trial Judge had not

misdirected himself, he ought to have come to the conclusion that the Defendant

was not in breach of the agreement P1.

Thus, the only issue that this court is called upon to decide is whether the

Defendant in fact had not breached the agreement P1, based on the grounds

raised by them: that the belated partial supply and non-supply of the balance

copies of the textbook by the Defendant were not treated as a default or as a

breach of contract by the Department (Plaintiff), and that such conduct on the

part of the Department amounts to a mutual termination of the agreement P1.

It was pointed out that the Department of Educational Publications being an organ

of the state, was required to adhere to the guidelines on Government Tender

Procedure. In terms of the said guidelines, it was pointed out, that the Department

was required to serve a written notice requiring the Appellant to show cause as to

why the Appellant should not be included in the list of defaulting contractors

and that this requirement is mandatory under the guidelines referred to above. It

7

was further pointed out that no such notice was served on the Appellant by the

Department.

It was also contended that the matter does not end by sending a show cause

letter, but a series of consequences flow, following a show cause letter. In terms of

the Government Tender Guidelines, no further contracts should be granted to

such defaulting contractor; no payments should be made without deducting any

dues and any Performance Bond given as security could be appropriated etc.

The learned counsel for the Appellant pointed out that as far as the Defendant-

Appellant was concerned, none of these procedures were put in motion by the

Department against them. It was also pointed out that it is in evidence that the

Appellant was neither issued with a show cause letter nor was blacklisted as a

contractor.

The learned counsel for the Defendant contended that the Defendant was

awarded other contracts, their performance bond was not appropriated for the

non-supply of the text books, and no deductions were made from the payments

that were made to the Appellant in relation to the other contracts awarded to the

Defendant. In this regard, attention of this court was drawn to the admission by

the witness who testified on behalf of the Respondent, that the Defendant was not

blacklisted as a contractor; three other contracts were awarded to the Defendant

subsequent to the Agreement P1, violating Regulation 159 of the Tender

Guidelines; making the final payment of the contract before the supply was

completed; non-appropriation of the performance bond; sending the Letter of

Demand (P10) 5 years after the alleged breach etc.

In the course of the submissions, the learned counsel for the Defendant referring

to the conduct of the Plaintiff as aforesaid, submitted that the cumulative effect of

those factors is a clear indication that non-supply of the required number of

books by the Defendant under agreement P1, was not treated as a default or a

breach of contract by the Plaintiff.

8

The learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the Plaintiff argued that the

failure on the part of the officials of the Educational Publications Department to

take action against the Defendant in terms of the Government Tender Guidelines

may amount to dereliction of duty on the part of the officials of the Department,

but those factors by themselves would not prove that the Defendant had not

breached the terms of the agreement P1.

In fact the learned trial Judge has considered this issue, namely non-compliance

with the Government Tender Guidelines, not blacklisting the Appellant, and

entering into fresh contracts with the Appellant even after the Defendant

defaulted or breached the agreement (P1). The learned trial Judge had quite

correctly held that the failure on the part of the government officials to take any

steps in performing their official duties referred to above, which could be a result

of administrative lapses on the part of the public officials, does not absolve the

Defendant from contractual obligations cast on them as per the agreement P1,

entered into by and between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.

With regard to the assertion of the Defendant that the parties mutually terminated

the agreement P1, the learned trial Judge had observed that if that was the case,

the Defendant could have specifically asserted so in their response to the Letter of

Demand (D3) or in the answer filed by the Defendant. The Defendant, the

learned trial Judge observed, had done neither. The learned trial Judge had

concluded that the assertion that the parties had terminated the agreement

mutually, is only an afterthought on the part of the Defendant. He had gone on to

conclude that no acceptable evidence has been placed before the court to deduce

that the Defendant had been released from the obligations arising out of

agreement P1. This, the Court observes, is a finding of fact by the learned trial

Judge and I am of the view that the learned trial Judge was entitled to form that

opinion and I see no fault on the part of the learned High Court Judge in arriving

at such a conclusion.

9

In light of the above, the contention by the Defendant that they, by their belated

partial performance of the contract and non-supply of the balance textbooks, did

not breach/are not in default of the contract P1, but that the contract has come

to a mutually agreed termination as implied by the conduct of the Plaintiff,

requires further scrutiny.

The Defendant avers that, by the conduct of the Plaintiff enumerated heretofore:

i.e. not serving notice to show cause, not blacklisting the Defendant, awarding

subsequent contracts and making payments without any deductions in the form of

a penalty to the Defendant, and not appropriating the performance bond, the

Plaintiff had tacitly released the Defendant from obligations and relinquished

further rights arising from the contract P1, by mutually agreeing to discharge

the contract.

Even though a waiver could be implied by conduct, the intention of a creditor,

(the Plaintiff in the present contract) to voluntarily renounce his/her obligations,

is never presumed or inferred, but has to be established through clear evidence.

Basanayake J (as His Lordship then was) has elaborated on this in Fernando v.

Samaraweera (1951) 52 NLR 278 at page 285,

An intention to waive a right or benefit to which a person is entitled is never

presumed. The presumption is against waiver the intention to waive a

right or benefit to which a person is entitled cannot be lightly inferred, but

must clearly appear from his words or conduct. The onus of proof of waiver

is on the person who asserts it.

This is resonated in C.G. Weeramantrys, Law of Contracts (1967 edition) at

page 716 where it is stated that, the reason for the time-honoured dictum that

waiver must be clearly proved (nemo facile praesumitur donare) is that

persons are not lightly held to have abandoned their rights.

10

Therefore, contentions based on administrative lapses, invoices for certain other

contracts between the same parties (V1), and a document prepared by the

Defendant Company subsequent to the commencement of the trial -

purportedly a Reconciliation of Account (D1) - demonstrating a sum of

money paid to the Defendants for a different contract with certain deductions

made- hardly discharge the onus of proof on the Defendant to clearly establish

an intention of voluntary relinquishment of rights by the Plaintiff.

As such, I reject the argument on behalf of the Defendant-Appellant that a waiver

of obligations is implied through the conduct of the Plaintiff-Respondent, bringing

the agreement P1 to a mutually agreed termination.

Further, the duty cast on the public officials by the Tender Guidelines to adhere to

the procedures stipulated under those Guidelines, in my view, are purely

administrative, a breach of which may expose the errant public officials to

disciplinary action being taken against them. Breach of such procedures, by itself,

has no impact on the contractual obligations of the parties, arising out of the

agreement between them (P1), in the instant case.

However, it is important to note that there is a stark paucity of any evidence, even

marginally insinuating, that the Defendant did in fact print the agreed number of

copiesas they undertook under clauses (1), (7) and (8) on or before the

deadline. They (Defendant) have attempted to absolve themselves from the

liability to pay damages by pointing to lapses in the Plaintiffs conduct without

clearly denying the Plaintiffs allegation that they (Defendant) failed to uphold

their contractual obligation to print and supply the agreed number of copies by

30. 11. 1999.

In his judgment, the learned High Court Judge has made a similar observation on

page 5 of the judgment;

11

120, 400 1999. 11. 30

. ,

.

The learned High Court Judge has further noted the admissions made by the

witnesses for the Defendant;

2008. 09. 02 7

.

. [...]

. 13 380, 000

, , 120, 400

. [...] 2008.

12. 01 5 1999. 11.

30 . 1 .

As the brief lays bare, the Defendant has failed to substantiate their position that

they were not in breach of the agreement. They have neither produced evidence

establishing that they fulfilled their obligations nor have they controverted the

evidence led by the Plaintiff to this effect. Their submissions have been largely

limited to lapses in the Plaintiffs conduct viz a viz the Guidelines on Government

Tender Procedure.

12

In respect of the submission on the final invoice, the learned High Court Judge

has observed that the final invoice marked as V1 has been prepared by the

Defendant after the case was instituted. More importantly the said invoice relates

to the printing of Mathematics Books commissioned under a different agreement

and it does not in any manner seek to alleviate the alleged breach of the

Agreement put in suit. In relation to the contention on the security bond, the

learned High Court Judge has noted that the Defendant has failed to produce any

evidence sustaining their claim, nor a copy of the bond itself to assist the Court to

appreciate their stance.

Having considered the evidence presented by the Plaintiff, and being satisfied of

the same, the learned High Court Judge has entered judgement in the Plaintiffs

favour;

120, 400

,

,

.

The Defendant has come before this Court impugning the said Judgement on the

ground that the learned High Court Judge has erred in attaching liability to the

Defendant to pay damages. However, there is nothing on the face of record to

indicate that the learned High Court Judge has erred, misdirected or failed to

consider evidence when delivering the judgment.

Accordingly, I agree with the learned High Court Judges decision that the

Defendant, by breaching clauses (1), (7) and (8) of the Agreement (P1) dated

03. 08 1999, is liable to pay Rs. 8, 005, 536.88 and legal interest to the

Government of Sri Lanka as damages for breach of contract, in terms of clauses

13

(15), (21) and (23) of the said Agreement. As such, I affirm the judgement of the

learned High Court Judge dated 17.11.2009 and accordingly dismiss the Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
