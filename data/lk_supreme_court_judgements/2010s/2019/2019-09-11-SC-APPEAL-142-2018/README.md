12th Defendant-Respondent-Appellant on 9th October, 2018. DECIDED ON : 11th September 2019. S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J. The Appellant preferred this against the Judgment of the High Court of the Western

Province holden in Gampaha (hereinafter referred to as the “High Court”) in a

Testamentary Case bearing No. WP/HCCA/GAM/08/2013. This judgment will be

confined to the issues in appeal.

Velupillai Nadarajah is the 12th Respondent- Respondent-Appellant, Velupillai

Nadarajah. He had obtained letter of Administration at the Testamentary Case

bearing No. 4356/T in the District Court of Negombo and filed the list of Inventory.

Parties concerned had disputed to the same and raised their objections. The District

Court had ordered on 6/10/1998 and all the parties agreed to dispose this matter on

written submissions and the same had being stated at the journal entry. Since, it is

directly involved with the question of appeal it is reproduced below for easy

reference.

Subsequently, Kandiahpillai Shanmuganathan, the original petitioner had died and

his son, Joseph Sri Rogers Shanmuganathan substituted in the said testamentary

action. He submitted to Court that, there are disputes regarding the inventory.

Therefore, he made an application to re-inquire the matter and to submit oral

evidence. The 12th Respondent- Respondent – Appellant objected and by order

dated 1/3/2013 Learned District Judge decided not to allow the fresh submissions.

Being unsatisfied with the said decision Substituted Petitioner-Petitioner–

Respondent appealed to the Provincial High Court of Gampaha and order dated

21/09/2016 the Learned Judges of the Civil Appellate Court allowed the appeal and

dismissed the order of the District Judge and allowed the Substituted Petitioner-

Petitioner–Respondent to lead oral and/documentary submissions.

Being aggrieved with the said order of the Provincial High Court 12th Respondent-

Respondent – Appellant preferred this appeal and leave granted on the following

questions of law set out in paragraph 76 (a) and (c) of the Petition dated 28th

October 2016.

(a) Have their Lordship of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Gampaha erred in law when they failed to

appreciate that the Substituted Petitioner-Petitioner-Respondent’s father

the original petitioner having accepted that no oral evidence is required

SC Appeal 142/2018 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

with regard to the inquiry into the determination of the Inventory,

Substituted Petitioner-Petitioner- Respondent was not thereafter entitled to

take a different stand;

(c) Have their Lordships of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Gampaha erred in law when they failed to

appreciate that the Substituted Petitioner-Petitioner- Respondent is not

entitled to deny and is estopped in law from taking a contrary and/or

inconsistent position to that of the Original Petitioner to whom he

succeeded. (Sic erat scriptum)

Considering the aforementioned questions of law, this Court has to decide whether a

substituted party in an action can deny the acceptance of the original party in a court

of law. Further, is the substituted party estopped from taking a contrary or

inconsistent position to that of the original party to the action?

In terms of Section 395 of the Civil Procedure Code Act reads as follows:

“In case of the death of a sole plaintiff or sole surviving plaintiff the legal

representative of the deceased may, where the right to sue survives, apply to the

court to have his name entered on the record in place of the deceased plaintiff,

and the court shall thereupon enter his name and proceed with the action.”

In terms of Section 395, on the death of a sole plaintiff, the legal representative may

be substituted by the Court on his application, if the right to sue survives. It is

observed that, the Substituted Petitioner- Petitioner- Respondent substituted in the

name of the original petitioner namely, Kandiahpillai Shanmuganathan.

It is my considered view that, the parties substituted will get the same rights,

privileges and responsibilities as the original party. This is subject to the provisions of

SC Appeal 142/2018 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

the respective law as stated above. Further, I am of the view that, when the original

party agreed to certain arrangements before the Court, the substituted party is

estopped and bound by the said arrangements. Legal representative must continue

litigation on the cause of action sued by the deceased.

I find support for this view in Sarkar's Law of Civil Procedure 8th edition volume 2 at

page, 1148, where the following observations have been made on the Indian Order

XXII Rule 2 of which the second part is identical with ours (S. 395):

“Pleas available to a Legal Representative- The legal representative can only

prosecute the cause of action as originally framed; similarly a defendant cannot

raise any defence which he could not have raised against the deceased plaintiff

himself [Shamchand v. Bhyaram, 22 C 92; Subbaraya v. Manicka, 19 M 345; Md

Naindu v. Ummanakani, A 1930 M 593]. If the original plaintiff did not raise the

objection regarding the pecuniary jurisdiction before the trial court at any stage,

his legal representatives cannot raise that question for the first time before the

appellate court [Shioprasad v. Smt. Mohanabai, A 1989 Bom 349, 352].

Legal representative has merely right to continue the suit and he cannot make

any claim to which the original plaintiff was not entitled [Gurdial Singh v.

Gurdev Singh, AIR 1991 P & H 240, 241].

(Emphasis added)

Gurdial Singh v. Gurdev Singh, AIR 1991 P H 240, (1992) 101 PLR 111, it was

held that,

“There is no quarrel with the proposition that legal representative has merely

Tight to continue the suit and he cannot make any claim to which the original

plaintiff was not entitled to...”

SC Appeal 142/2018 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the order made by the District Court on

1/3/2013 is correct. Accordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 21/09/2016 and direct the District Court to proceed

as per the order dated 1/3/2013.

It is also observed that, this case was instituted in 1966 which is more than 53 years

ago hence, I further direct the Learned Judge of the District Court to expeditiously

conclude and the parties are directed to corporate with the Learned District Judge to

conclude this case as earliest as possible.

Appeal allowed.
