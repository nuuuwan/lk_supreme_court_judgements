DECIDED ON : 13th November 2019.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The employee Applicant Respondent Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Employee) is absent and unrepresented. We peruse the journal entry and find that

there were notices issued on several occasions, including to his instructing attorney. All

the notices were returned without being served on the Employee. When the case was

taken up in open court, his name was called but he was absent and unrepresented.

The Counsel for the Respondent Appellant Petitioner (hereinafter referred to

as the Employer) commenced his submissions and submitted to the court that he had

obtained leave under paragraph 19 grounds (g) and (h) but, he will be confining himself

to only one question of law stipulated in Paragraph 19 (g) of the Petition. The said

question of law is reproduced for easy reference

(g) Has the Learned High Court Judge arrived at his conclusions by presuming the

Petitioner to be guilty of failing to follow the statutory provisions under the

Industrial Disputes Act pertaining to the deposit of the Applicants twelve month

salary, without considering the evidence?

(Sic eret scriptum)

SC Appeal 178/2018 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 6

I find it pertinent to establish the facts of the case prior to addressing the issues

before us. The Employee was employed as an inline Quality Controller at Linea Aqua

(Pvt) Limited who was the Employer. It is alleged that the employee had submitted

certain bogus claims and obtained funds from the insurance scheme with Union

assurance, where the employees are paid up to Rs 15, 000/- annually for the purchase

of spectacles. The workers are reimbursed the money spent, by the aforementioned

insurance company. The employer stated that the employee had fraudulently obtained a

sum of Rs 15, 000/- by presenting a false prescription and receipt. A domestic inquiry

was held and he was found guilty and his services were terminated.

Being aggrieved with the aforesaid decision the Employee, filed an application at

the Labour Tribunal of Gampaha. After an inquiry, the President of the Labour Tribunal

ordered reinstatement of the Employee without back wages and the reinstatement

should have taken effect from the 5th of September 2016.

The Employer submits that he had appealed against the said order to the

Provincial High Court of Gampaha on the 2nd of September 2016. The matter was then

taken up by the High Court. Learned High Court Judge on the 23rd of February 2018

decided that the Employer had not complied with Section 31 of the Industrial Disputes

Act by not depositing the money equivalent to one years salary of the Employee.

Accordingly he accepted the preliminary objection and dismissed the appeal.

In Wimalasiri Perera and Others V. Lakmali Enterprises Diesel and Petrol

Motor Engineers and Others [(2003) SLR Vol 1 page 62], the Labour Tribunal had

awarded compensation to the Applicants-Respondents-Appellants. The Employers-

Appellants-Respondents appealed to the High Court but failed to deposit security in

terms of section 31 D (4). In the said appeal to the Supreme Court, an objection was

taken up on behalf of the Applicants that the appeal could not be proceeded with since

security had not been deposited. The Employers did not deposit security even then, nor

did they tender any evidence as to the reason for that default. As per Fernando, J,

SC Appeal 178/2018 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 6

The deposit of security was mandatory; and the High Court erred in holding that

the unexplained failure to deposit security did not justify the rejection of the

appeal.

The Counsel for the Employer submits to the court that the aforementioned order

cannot be accepted. The Counsel further submits that he had complied with the

provision of the Industrial Disputes Act and therefore the High court judge erred in law

by not considering the evidence in the appeal.

I perused the brief before us. P10 which is a letter obtained for money deposited

at the Labour Tribunal of Gampaha, submitted by the Counsel is a motion dated 6th

September 2016 which carries neither endorsement nor rubberstamp of the High Court.

Further I could not find any corresponding entries in the journal entry. When inquired,

Counsel couldnt submit any material to show that this motion and the attached

document were before the High Court of Gampaha, at the relevant time.

The Counsel for the employer draws our attention to a document marked P11,

which is a letter stating that the Employer Appellant had deposited money equivalent

to two years salary which was signed by the Labour Tribunal and the President of the

Labour Tribunal. This motion was filed on the 16th of March 2018. When perusing, I find

that there is a date stamp of the High Court of Gampaha dated 16th March 2018.

If P10 was filed on the 6th of September 2016, I dont see any reason for the

Counsel for the Employer to file the same document through another motion, after the

delivery of the judgement at the High Court. I do not see that there is any evidence to

show that the said P10 was before the judge of the High Court at the time when he

delivered the judgement. Therefore, it is not possible to act on P10 and P11. The Appeal

was filed on the 2nd of September 2016. This shows that at the time of filing the appeal,

the Employer had not complied with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act.

SC Appeal 178/2018 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 6

Considering the question of Law, I find that the learned High Court judge had

considered the provisions of the Industrial Dispute Act and delivered the judgement.

Consequently I am not inclined to disturb the said findings.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal, with cost and I fix the cost at Rs. 10, 000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
