Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellant) instituted

action in the District Court of Mawanella against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondent) for declaration of title and for

3

ejectment of the Defendant-Respondent from the land called Madangahamulawatte

Assedduwe Kumbura. After the trial, the learned District Judge delivered the judgment dated

31st of March 2011 in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of

the District Court, the Defendant-Respondent appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal holden

in Kegalle. However, on appeal, the learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal, by the

judgment dated 23rd of October 2012, set aside the judgment of the District Court. Being

dissatisfied with the said judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal, the Plaintiff-Appellant has

made this appeal to this court seeking leave to appeal. This court, by the order dated 6th of

February 2013, granted leave to appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraph (7) (i) (ii)

(iii) (iv) (v) (vi) and (vii) of the Petition dated 30th November 2012, which reads as follows;

(i) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

erred in facts and law of this case declaring the Respondent has obtained prescriptive

title for the Corpus?

(ii) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

erred in law by giving undue weight on case No: 93969 filed under Primary Courts

Procedure Act in which the Respondent and one Jayarathne were the parties to the

case however, Petitioner was not a party to the same case?

(iii) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

have misinterpreted the provision under the section 110 of Evidence Ordinance?

(iv) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

have applied erroneously in their judgment that the detail in the Agricultural Land

Registry was prima facie evidence in prescription case?

4

(v) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

have failed to express reasons to reject findings of the learned District Judge,

Mawanella on contradictory evidence forwarded by the Respondent and her

witnesses for the defense?

(vi) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

have failed to give reasons for the conclusion in their judgment on adverse,

independent, uninterrupted possession of the Respondent for more than 10 years of

the subject matter as requirements to establish the prescriptive title for the subject

matter under section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance in favour of the Respondent?

(vii) Whether the Learned Judges of the High Court of Province (Civil Appellate), Kegalle

erred in facts and law by setting aside the judgment dated 31.03.2011 of the learned

District Judge, Mawanella?

The facts observed as relevant by this court will be summarized in order to ascertain the

question of law and facts in relation to the present case. In an action for declaration, the burden

to establish the title to the land is vested on the Plaintiff. As observed in the case of Abeykoon

Hamine vs. Appuhamy 52 NLR 49, the initial burden of proof rests on the plaintiff to prove that

he had dominium to the land in dispute. Furthermore, in Wanigarathne vs. Juwanis Appuhamy

65 NLR 167, Herat J observed that

In an action rei vindicatio, the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He cannot ask

for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the defendants title is

poor or not established.

Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the Plaintiff-Appellant in the present case has

discharged the burden of proof that rests on him. As per the evidence led before the District

5

Court, it can be summarized that, the original owner of the land was one Uduma Lebbe Mariyam

Bibi. By deed No. 4479 dated 19th August 1942, the land was transferred to Segu Mahudun

Adam Lebbe Padiliyar. Then, by the deed No. 4685 dated 26th October 1942, the same land was

transferred to Rajamanthrie Gedara Abaran Appu. Later, by the deed No. 213 dated 17th October

1994, this land was transferred to Rajamanthrie Gedara Somalatha who was the Plaintiff before

the District Court. Thus, this court is in a position, to observe that, the Plaintiff-Appellant has

established a clear paper title to the land in dispute.

In Fernando vs. Somasiri 2012 BLR 121, it was held that,

In a vindicatory action the burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff to prove his title

including identification of the boundaries and it is necessary to establish the corpus in a

clear and unambiguous manner.

Therefore, it is a must to consider these aspects, since the ownership cannot be ascribed

without clear identification of the land. (vide: Abdul Latheef v Abdul Majeed (2010) 2 SLR 333).

However, in the present case, there was no controversy and both parties admitted the

boundaries of the land in question.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff-Appellant has established the title to the land and clearly identified the

corpus. This was accepted by both the learned District Judge and the learned Judges of the High

Court. Conversely, the Defendant-Respondent argued before us, that he has been in possession

of the land in question and claimed prescriptive title to the land for over a period of ten years.

However, once the title is proved by the Plaintiff, the burden of proof shifts to the Defendant to

prove that he has a right to possession of the property (vide: Siyaneris vs. Udenis De Silva 52

NLR 289).

6

According to section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, if a person claims prescriptive title, he

must prove that he has been in undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possession of the land

for a period of ten years. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the Defendant-

Respondent has proved her prescriptive title to the land. As per the evidence adduced by the

Defendant-Respondent, one William Rathnasinghe has cultivated the said land prior to 80 years.

After the death of William Rathnasinghe, his son, Wilfred Rathnasinghe had cultivated the said

land and after the death of Wilfred, his son, Nandalal Rathnasinghe, and his daughter Wajira

Kanthi Rathnasinghe, who is the Defendant-Respondent in this case, has continued the

possession. Later, on 12th of July 2004, the Defendant-Respondents brother, Nandalal,

transferred undivided portion by deed No 3372 to his sister, the Defendant-Respondent.

In De Silva vs. Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue 80 NLR 292, it was held that;

A person who bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and unequivocal

evidence that his possession was hostile to the real owner and amounted to a denial of

his title to the property claimed.

Furthermore, in the case of Sirajudeen and others vs. Abbas (1994)2 SLR 365, G.P.S. De Silva CJ

held,

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of

witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding

the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should

speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by

Court. One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in

7

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be

of such character as is incompatible with the title of the owner.

Accordingly, when considering the present case, mere statements of witnesses that the

Defendant-Respondent possessed the land in dispute for several years exceeding prescriptive

period are not enough for rei vindicatio action and payment receipts issued on the basis of

Agricultural Land Register cannot be considered as prima facie evidence to prove undisturbed,

uninterrupted and adverse possession under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The learned Judges of the High Court when reversing the judgment of the learned District Judge

had further observed that,

Where the Plaintiff fails to prove ouster, the defendants possession must be assumed to

be lawful and the defendant is entitled to rely on the presumption created by section 110

of the Evidence Ordinance.

However, as discussed above, it is obvious that once the Plaintiff-Appellant has proved his or her

title to the land, then the burden shifts to the Defendant-Respondent to prove his or her

possession. In the said circumstances, section 110 of the Evidence Ordinance is misinterpreted

by the learned High Court Judges and cannot be assumed that the Defendant-Respondents

possession is lawful.

It is further observed by this court that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court were

carried away by a Primary Court decision which was marked as V-1 during the trial before the

8

District Court. Whilst referring to the said action before the Primary Court, it is observed in the

said judgment that,

It is worth to be mentioned that there is a case (case No. 93969) instituted under

Primary Court Procedure Act which is marked as V-1. This action clearly demonstrates

that there was a dispute between the defendant and one Jayarathne as to the possession

of the field. The Plaintiff in this case was not a party to case No. 93969 when the Plaintiff

was cross examined on this point she replied that she had intervened to the case, which

is a lie. On the other land, if she possess the land she should have been a party to this

case. This position clearly convinced my mind that the plaintiff did not possess the land

As revealed before us, the said action was instituted on 15th of April 2015 which is a day after

filing the present action before the District Court for Declaration of Title and ejectment of the

Defendant-Respondent.

Furthermore, a matter under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act is not a civil action

and the object is to prevent a breach of peace, not to decide any question of title or right to

possession of the parties to the land (vide: Ramalingam vs. Thangarajah (1982)2 SLR 693).

Therefore, an order of the said action does not affect to the civil case relating to the declaration

of title or rei vindicatio. Accordingly, based on the Order made by the Magistrates Court under

the section 66 application, the learned Judges of the High Court cannot justify that the

Defendant-Respondent in the present case had adverse possession to the land in dispute.

In Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993)1 SLR 119, it was held that, finding of primary facts by trial

judges who hear and see witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal. However, on the

perusal of the Judgment of the High Court, I observe that the learned Judges of the High Court

9

have failed to give reasons for rejecting the findings of the learned District Court Judge and the

learned High Court Judges are not in a position to re-analyze the facts of the case without having

any reasonable ground to do so. Accordingly, it can be concluded that there is no reasonable

basis upon the High Court to reverse the findings of the trial judge, since the learned District

Judge has clearly analyzed the facts of this case and has come to a correct conclusion.

As per the aforementioned reasons, I hold that the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had

erred in law when they reverse the judgment of the learned District Judge of Mawanella.

In the said circumstances, I answer the questions of law under which the leave was granted, in

favour of the Plaintiff- Appellant. The judgment dated 23.10.2012 of the Civil Appellate High

Court of Kegalle is set aside and the Judgment dated 31.03.2011 of the District Court of

Mawanella is affirmed.

The appeal is allowed.
