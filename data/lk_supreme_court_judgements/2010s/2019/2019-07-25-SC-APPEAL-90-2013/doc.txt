Counsel: Shanaka Ranasinghe PC with Niroshan Mihindukulasuriya,

for the Accused-Appellant- Appellant

Ms. Varunika Hettige, DSG for the Attorney General

Argued on 15.03.2019

Decided on 25.07.2019

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Hon. Attorney General had indicted the Accused Appellant Appellant (here in after referred to

as the Appellant) namely Sabrudeen Kamrudeen before the High Court of Negombo for possession

of 249.4 grams of diacetyl morphine, an offence punishable under section 54 (c) of the Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The Appellant faced the trial before the said High Court where the prosecution had relied on the

evidence of 04 witnesses, including the Chief Investigation Officer, Inspector of Police Priyantha

3 Liyanage and Inspector of Police Bogamuwa who assisted the said detection. When the court

decided to call for the defence, the Appellant after making a statement from the dock, led the

evidence of three witnesses, including a medical officer from prison hospital and two members of

his immediate family.

At the conclusion of the said trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant on the

indictment and sentenced him to death. Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence,

the Appellant preferred an appeal before the Court of Appeal.

At the conclusion of the hearing of the said appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction

and dismissed the appeal. The Appellant had preferred the present appeal before this court

challenging the said decision of the Court of Appeal.

When the Special Leave to Appeal application filed by the Appellant was supported before this

court on 21.05.2013, the court granted Special Leave on the following questions of law raised on

behalf of the Appellant.

1) The judgment of the Court of Appeal is contrary to law and against the weight of the

evidence adduced at the trial

2) Did the Court of Appeal misdirected itself by its failure to give adequate consideration to

the fact that the Petitioner truthfully unfolded the narrative in his dock statement which

fact clearly raises doubt as to the place and circumstances of the arrest

3) Did the Court of Appeal misdirected itself by its failure to give appropriate weightage to

the fact that,

i. There was a serious discrepancy between the gross weight of the Heroin

parcels (730 grams) as weighted by the electronic weighing scale of the

4

Police Narcotic Bureau and the gross weight of the Heroin parcels submitted

the Government Analyst (749.4 grams)

ii. There was a serious discrepancy in regard to the colour of the cellophane

bags said to have been seized from the Petitioner. According to the police

the bags were said to have been pink in colour but the cellophane bags

produced in court and submitted to the Government Analyst were found to

be blue in colour

iii. The Prison Doctor has stated that the injuries noted on the Petitioner were

consistent with a history of assault. No injures whatsoever have been noted

by the police at the time of arrest

iv. That the evidence of the son of the Petitioner corroborates his evidence

particularly as regards the place of arrest and the assault and was unshaken

in cross-examination

v. That the evidence of the Petitioner as regards to the place of arrest and the

assault was further corroborated by the evidence of his wife

vi. That the Court of Appeal has disregarded the clarification made and

emphasized that the wife of the Petitioner has stated in the Petitioner’s bail

application in the High Court that a parcel of Heroin was recovered from

under a dressing table in her house and thereby her evidence given at trial

that Heroin was not found in the possession of the Petitioner becomes false.

The Court of Appeal and the High Court have disregarded the fundamental

principle- Res inter Alios Acts Altieri Nocere Non Debet- that the acts,

declarations and conduct of others ought not to operate to the

disadvantage of another (the Petitioner)

5

vii. That Court of Appeal has not been cognizant of the fact that no such

recovery of Heroin has been made from the house of the Petitioner

according to the police, thus giving credence to the clarification of the

Petitioner’s wife as to the impugned statement in the affidavit

viii. That the productions have never been taken before a Magistrate’s Court

and all the purported seals have been placed therein by the Police Narcotics

Bureau (PNB) itself

ix. That in any event the said affidavit has not been marked in evidence and

hence is not part of the record

x. That the evidence establishes that the productions lay in the drawers of the

OIC of the PNB for over five days in violation of section 431 of the Criminal

Procedure Code

Even though the Appellant had relied on several grounds of appeal, as referred to above, the

learned President’s Counsel who represented the Appellant before us had mainly relied the appeal

to the following grounds,

1. The discrepancy of the gross weight of the Heroin when it was weighed at the Police

Narcotic Bureau and the Government Analyst

2. The discrepancy with regard to the colour of the cellophane bags said to have been

seized from the Appellant

3. The discrepancy with regard to the number of bags observed by the Government

Analyst during her examination

6

and submitted that the learned trial judge as well as their lordships of the Court of Appeal

had failed to give adequate consideration and appropriate weightage to the above discrepancies

and therefore the findings reached by the said courts were against the weight of the evidence

placed before the trial court.

As revealed before the trial court, the Appellant was arrested at Ananda Mawatha in the Wattala

Police Area when he was carrying a bag which contained eight parcels of Heroin. The said

detection was carried out by the officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau on a tip off received by an

informant of Inspector Liyanage.

Subsequent to the arrest the officers visited the house of the Appellant which was on the same

road but could not find anything incriminatory. The parcel recovered from the Appellant was a

polythene bag and inside the said polythene bag there was a brown paper bag which carried eight

cellophane bags containing suspected brown powder.

The subsequent investigations carried out by IP Liyanage after returning to the Police Narcotic

Bureau was explained by him as follows;

As observed by me, the matters raised on behalf of the Appellant before this court stems from the

evidence of witness Priyantha Liyanage referred to above.

When explaining how he weighed the eight parcels found inside the bag he recovered, witness

had taken up the position that each bag was separately weighed using the electronic scale at PNB

and the eight figures he obtained was added to each other in order to obtain the final figure

which was only 730 grams.

However when the production was referred to the Government Analyst for examination the total

weight of the brown powder was found to be 749.9 grams and the Government Analyst who

conducted the said examination had explained the condition under which she carried out her

examination as follows;

9 The learned President’s Counsel among the other issues raised before us, insisted that the above

discrepancy goes to the root of his case and the learned trial judge and their lordships of the Court

of Appeal, had failed to give due consideration to the above discrepancy.

However as observed by me the learned trial judge had considered the above discrepancy in her

judgment in the following terms;

As observed by this court, the learned trial judge had correctly analyzed the matter placed before

her with regard to the discrepancy in weight and come to a correct conclusion.

The learned President’s Counsel is further concerned with regard to the number of bags recovered

by the Government Analyst when she was conducting her examination. The learned President’s

10 Counsel highlighted the recovery of 16 “knotted bags” by the Government Analyst and argued

that it is contrary to the evidence of witness Priyantha Liyanage. According to the learned counsel,

witness Liyanage had referred to eight “knotted bags” and not to 16 knotted bags.

However when going through the evidence of witness Priyantha Liyanage, referred to above in

this judgment, it is clear that he refers to the sealing of bags in the following terms;

“md¾i,a 8 fjkafjka jYfhka úksúo fmfkk fmd,s;ska ne.a 8 lg oeïud ta md¾i,a 8

fjkafjka jYfhka úksúo fmfkk nE.a 8lg oeïud

If I understood the above explanation correctly, it appears to me that the witness had first put the

eight bags (which contained Heroin) in to 8 more transparent bags and thereafter put those 8

parcels (containing 16 bags) in to 8 more transparent bags and sealed them. Thereafter put the 8

parcels (sealed) in to another transparent bag and sealed it.

In his evidence witness Liyanage had not referred to putting an additional ‘knot’ on the second

bag, but that itself is not sufficient to reject his evidence.

The Government Analyst in her evidence had referred to the number of bags she found when

opening the parcel referred to by PNB in the following words,

As observed by this court the positions taken up by the two parties i.e. the Investigating Officer

and the Government Analyst corroborates each other. The learned President’s Counsel for the

Accused Appellant Appellant had an issue as to why both sets of bags had a knot but, this is a

matter for the person who did that to give an answer but, without asking the said question from

the witness, it is too late for the counsel to raise it as an issue before this court.

The next issue raised before this court is the discrepancy with regard to the colour of the bags

which contained Heroin. According to the bags produced before court the bags were light blue in

12 colour but the bags had been discolured to some extent. The Government Analyst when opened

the parcels had found Heroin inside eight bags and those bags were in light blue in colour.

However when the witness Priyantha Liyanage was questioned as to the colour of those bags, he

took up the position that those bags were pink in colour. As observed by this court, the said

question was put to the witness little prior to the opening of the sealed parcel, and once it was

opened the discrepancy was noticed. At that time the witness was asked to check the Productions

Register but it was observed that the colour of the bags which contained Heroin was not entered

in the Productions Register. It is also observed that no contradiction had been marked with regard

to the colour of the bags which contained Heroin when witness Priyantha Liyanage was cross

examined by the defence. In the said circumstances it is very much clear that the witness had

given the said answer from his memory after three years from the detection. Witness has further

said that he has conducted more than 250 such raids and one cannot expect any reasonable

person to keep everything in his memory to testify several years later. However the court observes

a laps from the part of the Investigating Officer for not entering the colour of those bags at least in

the Productions Register but when considering the amount of evidence placed before the trial

court to establish the identify of those productions, I am not in a position to agree with the

arguments placed before this court by the learned President’s Counsel. As further observed by this

court, the learned trial judge too had considered this discrepancy in her judgment but she

preferred to accept the explanation given by the witness under re-examination.

In addition to the three main grounds relied upon by the Appellant, the learned President’s

Counsel made submissions with regard to several other grounds on which the leave was granted

by this court. He submitted the failure by the Trial Judge and their Lordships of the Court of

Appeal to consider the Medical evidence placed before the trial court, which corroborates the

13 version given by the Appellant. He further referred to the dock statement made by the Appellant

and the evidence of his two witnesses his wife and the son and submitted that both the Trial Judge

and their Lordships of the Court of Appeal had failed to give adequate consideration and

appropriate weightage to those evidences.

I cannot agree with the learned President’s Council on the above submissions. As observed by me

the learned trial judge had correctly analyzed the Medical Evidence and the dock statement and

come to a correct conclusion. This is with regard to the injuries said to have received by the

Appellant due to assault by several sticks and poles at his residence prior to his arrest. The learned

trial judge as well as their Lordships of the Court of Appeal have considered the evidence given by

his wife and his son and rejected them having given reasons for their rejection. I see no reason to

interfere with those findings.

The failure by the officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau to take the productions before the

Magistrate and keeping the productions in police custody for 05 days were also raised by the

learned President’s Counsel. Even though he drew our attention to section 431 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979, he did not make submissions with regard to section 77A

which was introduced by the amending Act No 13 of 1984 to the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance.

Section 77A grants the officers the power to submit productions taken into custody, to the

Government Analyst without first submitting them to the Magistrate’s Court in Narcotic Cases and

as observed by this court the above provision is used when detections are carried out by the

officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau. However as further observed by this court, the most

important factor to be considered in a Narcotic Case is the inward journey and not whether the

provisions of 77A or 431 is followed.

14 This factor was considered in several cases including in the case of Perera V. Attorney General

1998 (1) Sri LR 378 by J.A.N. de. Silva (J) (as he was then) as follows;

“The most important journey is the inwards journey because the final Analyst Report will

depend on that”

In the absence of any challenge with regard to the inward journey by the learned President’s

Counsel, I see no basis to uphold his objection.

When considering the matters discussed in this judgment I observed that the Appellant is not

successful in establishing the grounds on which the Special Leave had been granted by this court.

I therefore make order dismissing this appeal.

Appeal dismissed, No costs.
