The new scheme set out in \u201cP6\u201d was deemed to have come into effect from 01st August 2005 onwards. Accordingly, from the time this new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d was issued, recruitments to the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service were to be made and promotions within the four newly created Grades and Classes were to be effected, under and in terms of \u201cP6\u201d. Prior to the new Service Minute, the petitioner had been placed in Class III Grade II of the scheme which prevailed under and in terms of the previous Service Minute marked \u201cP2\u201d. As set out hereinafter, when the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d came into force, the petitioner continued to serve in Class III Grade II of the previous Service Minute marked \u201cP2 until 02nd November 2006. On that day, the petitioner was absorbed, with effect from 02nd November 2006, into the new Class II Grade II of \u201cP6\u201d on a supernumerary basis. On 23rd November 2009, the petitioner complained that he was entitled to have been absorbed with effect from 01st August 2005 [and not with effect from 02nd November 2006] into Class II Grade II under the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d. He complained that he was unhappy about the seniority and salary point he was placed at under \u201cP6\u201d. He stated that, therefore, he wished to exercise an option for early retirement which was possible under \u201cP6\u201d in cases in which the Public Service Commission was satisfied that the implementation of \u201cP6\u201d had adversely affected the conditions of service of an officer in the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service to such an extent that he should be permitted to retire and receive a pension under section 7 of the Minute on Pensions. The petitioner\u2019s request was refused by the Secretary to the Ministry of Land and Land Development, who was the officer having authority in this regard [the Public Service Commission had not been constituted at that time]. The petitioner made an application to the Court of Appeal seeking writs of certiorari quashing that refusal and writs of mandamus directing the Secretary of the Ministry to permit the petitioner to exercise the option of taking early retirement. The Court of Appeal dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application. The petitioner made an application to this Court seeking special leave to appeal. He subsequently filed an amended petition. The respondents to this amended petition are the Secretary and former Secretary of the aforesaid Ministry, the Surveyor General and the Secretary to the Public Service Commission. Subsequently, successors to the aforesaid respondents and the members of the Public Service Commission were also added as respondents.",

The petitioner filed a counter affidavit. The Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service As mentioned earlier, the recruitment and promotion of officers in the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service was previously governed by the Service Minute marked \u201cP2\u201d. This Service Minute placed the officers of the Service in seven Grades and Classes within which recruitment and promotion was effected - ie: (i) Class I Grade I; (ii) Class I Grade II; (iii) Class II Grade I; (iv) Class II Grade II; (v) Class III Grade I; (vi) Class III Grade II and (vii) Class III Grade III. Thus, under \u201cP2\u201d, the entry level grade to the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service was Class III Grade III. The qualifications required of new recruits to Class III Grade III were passing the G.C.E. [Ordinary Level] Examination/G.C.E. [Advanced Level] Examination. There was also provision for recruitment of graduates from recognized Universities directly to higher Classes and Grades in the Service. Under the Service Minute marked \u201cP2\u201d, officers in the aforesaid entry level Class III Grade III were entitled to be promoted to the next level of Class III Grade II upon completion of five years\u2019 service in Class III Grade III and passing the Diploma of Survey Technician (Advanced Level) Examination. Thereafter, \u201cP2\u201d provided that promotion to the higher level of Class III Grade I would be upon passing the Departmental Junior Professional Examination or upon completing nine years of satisfactory service after reaching the salary point of Rs. 25,800/- in Class III Grade II or upon reaching the salary point of Rs. 36,000/- in Class III Grade II with satisfactory service. The criteria for promotion to higher positions in the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service under \u201cP2\u201d - ie: Class II Grade II and above - are not directly relevant to this application and need not be considered.",

It simplified the structure of seven Classes and Grades which existed under \u201cP2\u201d and provided for only four Classes and Grades within the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service - ie: (i) Selection Class; (ii) Class I; (iii) Class II Grade I; and (iv) Class II Grade II. Thus, the entry level grade to the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service under and in terms of the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d was Class II Grade II. Entrants to Class II Grade II were to be recruited by the Public Service Commission from the ranks of \u201cApprentice Surveyors\u201d of the Sri Lanka Survey Department who held either a degree in Surveying Science and had served as \u201cApprentice Surveyors\u201d for four years or a degree in Physical Science and had served as \u201cApprentice Surveyors\u201d for six years. It should be mentioned here that \u201cApprentice Surveyors\u201d functioned in the Sri Lanka Survey Department but outside the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service. They were selected for appointment as \u201cApprentice Surveyors\u201d upon the results of an Open Competitive Examination. The minimum educational qualification required to sit for this examination was a Degree in either Surveying Science or Physical Science. Thus, the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d specified that, from its implementation onwards, all recruits to the entry level Class II Grade II of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service had to hold a degree in Surveying Science or Physical Science. Several officers of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service who were in service at the time \u201cP6\u201d was issued in 2006 did, in fact, hold degrees in Surveying Science or Physical Science. However, there were also several serving officers who did not hold such a degree. In these circumstances, the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d had to make suitable provision for the absorption of all serving officers of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service to the appropriate Classes and Grade formed under the new structure introduced by \u201cP6\u201d. Thus, with regard to officers who were in Class III Grade I, Class III Grade II and Class III Grade III under and in terms of the previous Service Minute marked \u201cP2\u201d, the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d provided for their absorption into the newly created Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d in the following manner:",

The petitioner states that, up to the end of December 2008, the Sri Lanka Survey Department and the Public Service Commission maintained two separate seniority lists. One list was of officers who had been absorbed into the permanent cadre of the newly created Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d as at 01st August 2005 because they qualified under clause 7.1 (i) and 7.1 (ii) of \u201cP6\u201d. The other list was of officers who did not qualify for absorption into the permanent cadre but had qualified for absorption into Class II Grade II on a \u201csupernumerary basis\u201d under clause 7.1 (iii) and 7.1 (iv) of \u201cP6\u201d. The petitioner says that \u201che became aware later\u201d that there was a move to prepare a single seniority list. He says the new single seniority list was to place those officers who had been absorbed into the permanent cadre of the new Class II Grade II at the time of the issue of \u201cP6\u201d above the officers who were later absorbed into the new Class II Grade II on a supernumerary basis. A draft of the proposed single seniority list of Surveyors in Class II Grade II as at 01st January 2009 was marked \u201cP23\u201d. The petitioner claims that, the formulation of a new single seniority list on the aforesaid basis as set out in \u201cP23\u201d resulted in about 250 officers who had been junior to him prior to the issue of the Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d, being placed above him on the new seniority list. The petitioner also claims that the conversion of the salaries of officers in the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service in line with the new structure established by \u201cP6\u201d led to the petitioner being placed at a salary point which was about Rs.7,000/- less than the salary point at which most of his colleagues were placed. The petitioner pleads that, for the aforesaid reasons, he wrote the letters dated 23rd November 2009 and 22nd February 2010 marked \u201cP9\u201d and \u201cP11\u201d requesting that he be allowed to exercise the option of early retirement which was provided by clause 12 of \u201cP6\u201d. A perusal of \u201cP9\u201d and, in particular, \u201cP11\u201d shows that the petitioner sought to exercise the option for early retirement on the basis that the implementation of \u201cP6\u201d resulted in him being placed at a lower position on the seniority list and at a lower salary point than his colleagues and, thereby, caused him grave prejudice. It is common ground that, prior to writing \u201cP9\u201d, the petitioner obtained a degree in Surveying Science on 25th September 2009. Thus, from that day onwards, he qualified to be absorbed into the permanent cadre of Class II Grade II under and in terms of \u201cP6\u201d.",

Instead, as stated in these letters, the petitioner was placed at a lower position on the seniority list due to him having taken No-Pay Leave for a period of two years and, therefore, becoming entitled to be absorbed into Class II Grade II only on 02nd November 2006. In this regard, the petitioner admits that he had proceeded abroad on No-Pay Leave from 29th August 2000 to 04th September 2002. However, the petitioner contends that officers of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service had been previously advised, by the Departmental Circulars dated 28th February 1998 and 04th June 2001 marked \u201cP24\u201d and \u201cP25\u201d, that availing oneself of No-Pay Leave \u201cwould not generally affect seniority.\u201d.

The petitioner pleads that the refusal to permit him to proceed on early retirement was ultra vires, illegal and arbitrary. He also contends that this refusal was in breach of his legitimate expectations.

Further, they state that, while the educational qualification required to enter Class III Grade III under \u201cP2\u201d was passing the GCE Ordinary Level/Advanced Level Examination, the educational qualification required of new recruits to Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d was a degree in Surveying Science or Physical Science. The respondents also point out that officers serving in Class III Grade III and Class III Grade II under \u201cP2\u201d [such as the petitioner] who were directly absorbed into in the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d, thereby, \u201cskipped\u201d having to first reach and serve in Class III Grade I under and in terms of \u201cP2\u201d before being entitled to seek promotion to Class II Grade II under \u201cP2\u201d. Accordingly, the respondents contend that when officers in the three Grades of Class III under \u201cP2\u201d were \u201cabsorbed\u201d into the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d, they were, in reality, promoted to a higher position. Next, it is common ground that, since the petitioner was in Class III Grade II [under \u201cP2\u201d] on 01st August 2005 when \u201cP6\u201d came into effect and since he did not hold a degree in Surveying Science or Physical Science, the petitioner was entitled to be absorbed on a supernumerary basis into the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d only upon passing the Junior Professional Examination and upon completing a service period of fifteen years - vide: clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d. The respondents submit that, although the petitioner had passed the Junior Professional Examination by 01st August 2005, he had not completed a service period of fifteen years by that day because the petitioner had, after joining the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service on 20th October 1989, been on No-Pay Leave for a period of two years prior to 01st August 2005. The respondents state that, in terms of the applicable rules and procedures, this period of two years No-Pay Leave has to be deducted when computing the date on which the petitioner completed a period of fifteen years\u2019 service for the purpose of absorption into Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d. They say that when this period of two years\u2019 No-Pay Leave is deducted, the petitioner completed a period of fifteen years\u2019 service only on 02nd November 2006 and that he was duly absorbed into Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d with effect from that day, as set out in \u201cP7\u201d. In this regard, the respondents refer to clause 16:10 of the Establishments Code which stipulates that a period of No-Pay Leave has to be deducted when computing a",

Similar views have been expressed in the letter dated 05th October 2015 marked \u201c7R4(b)\u201d written by the Director General - Establishments. The respondents point out that the petitioner remained in his earlier Class III Grade II [under \u201cP2\u201d], as specifically required by clause 7.1(v) of \u201cP6\u201d, until 02nd November 2006 on which date the petitioner completed a service period of fifteen years and, thereby, qualified to be absorbed into the new Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d. The respondents contend that, thereby, the petitioner accepted this position \u201cwithout demur\u201d. With regard to the seniority lists, the respondents state that maintaining two separate lists - ie: one of officers who had been absorbed into the permanent cadre and one of officers who had been absorbed on a supernumerary basis - gave rise to difficulties. Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the formulation of a single seniority list, as set out in the documents marked \u201c1R1(a)\u201d and \u201c1R1(b)\u201d. In this single seniority list, officers serving in all three Grades of Class III [under \u201cP2\u201d] who qualified to be absorbed, on 01st August 2005, into the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d [either into the permanent cadre as specified in clauses 7.1 (i) and 7.1 (ii) or on a supernumerary basis as specified in clause 7.1 (iii) and clause 7.1 (iv)] were placed in the order of their seniority which prevailed prior to the issuance of \u201cP6\u201d. Thereafter, officers serving in all three Grades of Class III under \u201cP2\u201d [such as the petitioner] who subsequently qualified to be absorbed into the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d [either into the permanent cadre or on a supernumerary basis] were placed on that single seniority list according to the day on which they were absorbed into Class II Grade II upon obtaining the required qualifications specified in \u201cP6\u201d. Thus, the respondents\u2019 position is that the petitioner\u2019s place on the new single seniority list was not due to any prejudice caused to him by the provisions of the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation but was due to the deduction of the period of two years\u2019 No-Pay Leave as required by clause 16:10 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code when computing the period of fifteen years\u2019 service needed for absorption into Class II Grade II under clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d. Next, the respondents state that the petitioner\u2019s salary point was lower than that of his colleagues not due to the provisions of or implementation of \u201cP6\u201d but because the petitioner failed to pass the First Efficiency Bar Examination within the stipulated time",

In this connection, the respondents have marked as \u201c7R7\u201d the notice sent to the petitioner advising him of the cancellation of these increments. The respondents plead that, for the aforesaid reasons, the 2nd respondent had duly refused the petitioner\u2019s application for early retirement for the reason that the petitioner had not suffered prejudice due to the provisions of new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation as contemplated by clause 12 of \u201cP6\u201d. The respondents also state that, while serving in Class II Grade II of \u201cP6\u201d on a supernumerary basis from 02nd November 2006 onwards, the petitioner obtained a degree in Surveying Science and became entitled to enter the permanent cadre of Class II Grade II on 25th September 2009, under and in terms of \u201cP6\u201d. They point out that, it is only thereafter that the petitioner sought early retirement by his letter dated 23rd November 2009 marked \u201cP9\u201d. The respondents plead that, in these circumstances, the delay on the petitioner\u2019s part and the petitioner\u2019s conduct disentitled him from maintaining this application. Decision Firstly, it has to be kept in mind that, at the time the Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d was issued and implemented, the petitioner made no complaint about the new schemes set out in \u201cP6\u201d for the absorption of serving officers of the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service into the four new Classes and Grades created by \u201cP6\u201d and for the promotion of officers within those new Classes and Grades. Instead, the petitioner continued, without any expression of dissatisfaction or dissent, to serve in the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service subject to the terms and conditions with regard to the absorption and promotion which are set out in \u201cP6\u201d. Accordingly, it can be reasonably inferred that the petitioner accepted the validity of the schemes for absorption and promotion introduced by the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d and continued to serve in the Sri Lanka Surveyor\u2019 Service subject to \u201cP6\u201d. Next, it is common ground that the petitioner did not hold a degree in Surveying Science or Physical Science which would have entitled him to be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the new Class II Grade II in terms of clauses 7.1(i) or 7.1 (ii) of \u201cP6\u201d. Thus, it is undisputed that the earliest the petitioner would have qualified for absorption into Class II Grade II [on a supernumerary basis] was upon passing the Junior Professional",

It is also common ground that the petitioner had passed the Junior Professional Examination as at 01st August 2005 when \u201cP6\u201d came into effect. Therefore, and as evident from the positions of the parties set out above, the crux of the appeal before us is determining when the petitioner completed a service period of fifteen years and, thereupon, qualified for absorption into Class II Grade II [on a supernumerary basis] in terms of clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d. On the one hand, as set out above, the petitioner\u2019s contention is that he joined the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service on 20th October 1989 and, therefore, he completed a period of fifteen years\u2019 service on 20th October 2004. On that basis, he submits that he had completed a period of fifteen years\u2019 service when the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d came into force on 01st August 2005 and that, accordingly, he was entitled to be absorbed into Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d [on a supernumerary basis] on 01st August 2005, in terms of clause 7.1 (iii). He submits that his absorption into Class II Grade II only with effect from 02nd November 2006 resulted in him losing seniority in the single seniority list prepared in 2010 and being placed at a lower salary point. On the other hand, as set out above, the respondents submit that the petitioner first became entitled to be absorbed into Class II Grade II [on a supernumerary basis] only on 02nd November 2006 because the period of No-Pay Leave he had taken had to be deducted when computing the date on which the petitioner completed a service period of fifteen years. It is evident that, if the aforesaid period of No-Pay Leave is to be deducted, the petitioner would have completed a period of fifteen years only on or about 02nd November 2006 - ie: the day on which the petitioner was, in fact, absorbed into the new Class II Grade II [on a supernumerary basis], as stated in \u201cP7\u201d. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether, in terms of \u201cP6\u201d and the applicable rules, the aforesaid period of No-Pay Leave had to be deducted when fixing the date on which the petitioner completed a service period of fifteen years for the purpose of qualifying for absorption into Class II Grade II under clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d. As stated earlier, the respondents submit that the provisions of clause 16:10 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code apply and require that the period of No-Pay Leave be deducted. In this regard, clause 11 of \u201cP6\u201d specifies that the provisions of the Establishments Code will apply when deciding seniority. Further, as stated in clause 12:1 of Chapter II",

Further, the letter marked \u201c7R4(b)\u201d written by the Director General - Establishments succinctly explains the reasons for the rule stated in clause 16:10 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code and its application when computing the periods of service required for absorption into the new Class II Grade II under the several limbs of clause 7.1 of \u201cP6\u201d. He explains that a public officer who takes No-Pay Leave for his own private purposes [such as the petitioner] renders no service to the State during the period of No-Pay Leave and that, therefore, the period of No-Pay Leave cannot be regarded as a period of active service. He goes on to observe that, in these circumstances, if a period of No-Pay Leave is taken into account when absorbing an officer into a new position, other officers who had served continuously without taking No-Pay Leave, would be unfairly prejudiced.

    "text": "It should also be mentioned that a perusal of the other provisions of clause 16 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code shows that a period of No-Pay Leave is not to be reckoned for \u201cpension purposes\u201d [clause 16:8], and that an officer on No-Pay Leave should not be considered for promotion to any vacancies which may arise during his period of No-Pay Leave [clause 16:9]. On the same lines, clause 16:11 states that where a scheme of recruitment stipulates that a certain salary point should be reached for eligibility for consideration for a promotion, any increments granted during No-Pay Leave are not to be taken into account in reckoning the salary point for the purposes of promotion. Thus, it appears that, for the reasons stated in \u201c7R4(b)\u201d, the scheme of the Establishments Code is to exclude a period of No-Pay Leave when computing the eligibility of a public officer to receive benefits and advancements which are based on his period of service to the State. It has to be also kept in mind that the petitioner had passed the Junior Professional Examination by 01st August 2005 and was entitled to be absorbed into Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d immediately upon completing a period of fifteen years\u2019 service under and in terms of clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d. However, the petitioner was not absorbed into the new Class II Grade II created by \u201cP6\u201d with effect from 01st August 2005 since he had not completed a period of fifteen years\u2019 service by that date. Therefore, he continued to serve in Class III Grade II under the previous Service Minute marked \u201cP2\u201d, as required by clause 7.1 (v) of \u201cP6\u201d in the case of all officers who were not qualified for absorption into new Class II Grade II as at 01st August 2005. The petitioner made no protest and did not claim that he was entitled to be absorbed into the new Class II Grade II with effect from 01st August 2005. Instead, the petitioner continued to serve in in Class III Grade II under \u201cP2\u201d until he was absorbed into the new Class II Grade II only with effect from 02nd November 2006. The petitioner\u2019s aforesaid conduct gives rise to the inference that he accepted and acknowledged that he had not completed a service period of fifteen years as at 01st August 2005 and that he completed a service period of fifteen years only on or about 02nd November 2006, when he was absorbed into Class II Grade II. In the circumstances set out above, I am of the view that the rule stated in clause 16:10 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code applies and that the petitioner completed a service period of fifteen years for the purpose of qualifying for absorption into Class II Grade II in terms of clause 7.1 (iii) of \u201cP6\u201d only on 02nd November 2006, as stated in \u201cP7\u201d and as submitted by the respondents.",

    "text": "It follows that the petitioner\u2019s position on the revised single seniority list was correctly assigned on the basis that he was absorbed into Class II Grade II [on a supernumerary basis] only on 02nd November 2006. In these circumstances, it is clear that the petitioner has not been prejudiced by the provisions of \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation. Instead, his position on the single seniority list is a result of the rule stipulated in clause 16:10 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code that a period of No-Pay Leave must be deducted when computing the minimum service period required for absorption into Class II Grade II under \u201cP6\u201d. Thus, there is no merit in petitioner\u2019s first complaint made in his letter marked \u201cP9\u201d seeking early retirement. With regard to the petitioner\u2019s second complaint, that he has been placed on a lower salary point, the respondents have explained that this was not due to the provisions of the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation but, instead, due to the cancellation of several increments as a result of the petitioner failing to pass the first Efficiency Bar exam within the stipulated time, as set out in \u201c7R7\u201d. Thus, there is also no merit in the petitioner\u2019s second complaint made in his letter marked \u201cP9\u201d. Further, as mentioned earlier, the petitioner has obtained a Degree in Surveying Science and, thereby, qualified to be absorbed into the permanent cadre of Class II Grade II with effect from 25th September 2009. He was then eligible for promotion to Class II Grade I upon completing ten years\u2019 satisfactory service in Class II Grade II and subject to the other terms and conditions of clause 8.1 of \u201cP6\u201d. This occurred prior to the petitioner writing his letter marked \u201cP9\u201d seeking to proceed on early retirement. Thus, the petitioner, who was in his early forties at the time of writing \u201cP9\u201d, had a clear career path allowing for promotion within the Sri Lanka Surveyors\u2019 Service. This is another reason which led to the second respondent refusing the petitioner\u2019s request for early retirement. It also has to be kept in mind that clause 12 of the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d allowed an officer to exercise the option of early retirement only where the Public Service Commission was satisfied that that provisions of \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation prejudiced that officer to such an extent that he should be allowed to proceed on early retirement under section 7 of the Minute on Pensions rather than be compelled to serve under those adverse conditions. It is also relevant to take into account the fact that section 7 of the Minute on Pensions deals with the pension payable to a public officer whose office has been \u201cabolished\u201d. This leads to the inference that clause 12 of \u201cP6\u201d could be properly invoked only in instances where the provisions of \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation have prejudiced the conditions of service of an officer to such an extent",

    "text": "that he cannot be reasonably expected to continue to serve under those adverse conditions. As set out above, the petitioner certainly did not find himself in such a predicament. Thus, the Court of Appeal correctly held that the petitioner was not prejudiced by the provisions of the new Service Minute marked \u201cP6\u201d or its implementation and that the 2nd respondent did not act illegally or arbitrarily when he refused the petitioner\u2019s application for early retirement. Accordingly, the aforesaid question of law is answered in the negative and the appeal is dismissed. The parties will bear their own costs.
