The judgement was delivered on 08.09.1998 holding with the Plaintiff and ordering to partition the land sought to be partitioned. Thus, the learned District Judge held in favour of the Plaintiff rejecting the stance of the Defendant that the deed no. 9116 is a deed of gift which could be cancelled under the Kandyan Law by a subsequent deed.",

    "text": "The intention of the vendor indicated by the form of the deed, commencement of the deed as well as the most important operative part of the deed is nothing other than a sale of the land described in the schedule to the deed for a valuable consideration of Rs.25000.00. Moreover, the vendor has admitted that the consideration was paid to her. Once the money is paid the obligation on the part of the buyer is fulfilled. The seller has to respect his obligations as there are no other conditions imposed on the buyer. On the other hand, the agreement between the two parties is contained mainly in the operative part and other clauses may be helpful in interpreting when there is obscurity in the operative part. As shown above there is no ambiguity in the operative part. The dispute with regard to the intention of the vendor is based on what the Notary public has mentioned in his attestation. The attestation does not contain the terms or conditions of the agreement between the parties. It is not among what is read to the parties before they sign the deed in agreement. The attestation is solely done by the Notary, most probably not in the presence of the parties. It generally contains facts in relation to the identity of the parties; the correction of typographical or clerical errors done by him; whether the deed was read over and explained to the parties before they signed it in the presence of each other, the witnesses and the Notary public; whether the consideration was passed before him or not. In the case at hand, the Notary has mentioned in his attestation that the consideration mentioned in the deed was renounced as a donation due to the compassion towards the vendee.

However, the Appellant\u2019s contention is that the consideration was not passed and the deed No.9116 is a deed of gift which can be revoked by the donor. As said before the aforesaid phrase in the attestation cannot be a term read over to the parties and explained before they signed the deed. The operative part, the form of deed and the words contained in the body of the agreement for which parties signed after being read over by the Notary have no uncertainty that warrants any interpretation. As per the operative part of the deed, the vendor has admitted payment of money as consideration for the sale of land. Thus, the transaction of sale was culminated with such payment and acceptance. After that, if the money is renounced it has to be considered as a gift of money but not the land already sold.",

Even the attestation part which is an act of the Notary Public refers to a renunciation of the consideration money paid as a donation, but it does not reveal which party instructed or stated that to the said Notary Public or whether the vendee accepted the returned consideration. Furthermore, the admission no. 5 made at the commencement of the trial is in fact an admission of the sale of land by the impugned deed. For the foregoing reasons, it is my considered view that on the face of it, the impugned deed is a deed executed in view of a transfer of a land on payment of a consideration i.e. sale of a land for money.",

The Respondent in that case tried to argue that the said deed was not a gift within the meaning of section 2(a) of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Act owing to the condition which required the donee to perform and render to the donor all needful assistance during the period of her natural life and after her death to bury her remains decently according to the customs of the Buddhist religion. The counsel for the Respondent in that case appears to have argued that as the donee had to perform certain services and, if a money value could be placed on such service it was not a gift. But the court held otherwise. The court found that the consideration was natural love and affection towards the donee and the deed described the transaction as a gift. Furthermore, the court said that inclusion of a clause containing the words that a gift is subject to the donee rendering all necessary succor and assistance to the donor or words to that effect was not uncommon in deeds of gifts in the Kandyan Province. Thus, there the attempt to interpret a deed of gift as a \u2018transfer on a consideration\u2019 in view of a clause contained in the main part of the deed was refused. If the same wisdom is applied here to the case at hand, owing to the reasons mentioned before, the argument that the deed is a deed of gift owing to the aforesaid statement of the Notary which is not even a condition or term in the main part of the deed must fail. On the other hand, the consideration in the instant case is money paid as per the operative part of the deed.",
