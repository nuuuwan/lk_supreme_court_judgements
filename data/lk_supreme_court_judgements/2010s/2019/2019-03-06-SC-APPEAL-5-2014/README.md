This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

1/10/2013 wherein he affirmed the order of the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal dated 30.9.2011. This court by its order dated 20.1.2014 granted leave to

appeal on questions of law stated in paragraphs 14(b),(d),(e) of the Petition of

Appeal dated 6.11.2013 which are set out below.

1. Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court misdirect himself, whilst

correctly holding that the Respondent is a probationer, but thereafter failing

to apply the law applicable to the probationers?

2. Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court misdirect himself on the pivotal

question of burden of proof with regard to allegations of malice on the part

of the Petitioners?

3. Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court misdirect himself on the

question of who should start the case?

Learned President of the Labour Tribunal by the said order dated 30.9.2011

directed the Respondent-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Employer-Appellant) to reinstate the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-Respondent) and to transfer the Applicant-

Respondent to a different estate controlled by the Employer-Appellant.

The Applicant-Respondent was appointed on 1.7.2009 as an Assistant Manager of

an estate owned by the Employer-Appellant. He was placed on probation for a

4

period of six months from1.7.2009. By letter dated 28.1.2010 his probation period

was extended for a further period of three months from 1.1.2010 to 31.3.2010. By

letter dated 17.3.2010 his services were terminated with effect from 1.4.2010 as his

performance had not been improved during the period of probation. The Employer-

Appellant admitted that the services of the Applicant-Respondent were terminated

whilst he was on probation. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal made an

order that the Employer-Appellant should begin the case as the Employer-

Appellant has admitted the termination of the Applicant-Respondent. Learned

Presidents Counsel for the Employer-Appellant contended that the said order of

the learned President of the Labour Tribunal was wrong since the termination of

services took place whilst the Applicant-Respondent was on probation. Therefore,

one of the important questions that must be decided in this case is whether the

Applicant-Respondent was on probation when his services were terminated.

Learned counsel for the Applicant-Respondent tried to advance an argument to the

effect that when the period of probation of the Applicant-Respondent was extended

on 28.1.2010, his period of probation had already come to an end since he had

been placed on six months period of probation at the initial stage of his

appointment and that this period of probation had come to an end on 31/12/2009. I

now advert to this question. In order to find an answer to this question it is

necessary to consider the clauses relating to probation in the letter of appointment.

They are as follows.

1. Your appointment will be subject to a probationary period of six (06)

months commencing from date of your appointment, but we reserve to

ourselves the right to extend your probationary period if we deem it

necessary.

5

2. During the period of probation or extended probation, either party may

terminate this contract without notice and without pay in lieu of notice and

without assigning any reason for such termination.

3. Confirmation of your appointment shall be in writing and at our sole

discretion. You will continue to be on probation until you are confirmed.

Thus, according to above clauses in in the letter of appointment, the Employer-

Appellant has the right to extend the period of probation. By letter marked R4

dated 26.1.2010, his period of probation has been extended with effect from

1.1.2010. Further, clause 3 of his letter of appointment, says that the Applicant-

Respondent will be on probation until he is confirmed in service. The Applicant-

Respondent has not been confirmed in service at any stage. For the above reasons,

I hold that the Applicant-Respondent was on probation when his services were

terminated.

The next question that must be decided is whether the learned President of the

Labour Tribunal was correct when he ordered the Employer-Appellant to

commence the case. To find an answer to this question it is important to consider

the judicial decision in the case of Anderson Vs Husny [2001] 1 SLR 168 wherein

His Lordship Justice Fernando held as follows.

Upon proof that termination took place during probation, the burden is on

the employee to establish unjustifiable termination, and the employee must

establish at least a prima facie case of mala fide before the employer is

called upon to adduce evidence as to his reasons for dismissal; and the

employer does not have to show that the dismissal was, objectively,

justified.

6

In the present case, I have earlier held that the services of the Applicant-

Respondent were terminated whilst he was on probation. When the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal made an order that the Employer-Appellant

should commence the case, his order was contrary to the principles enunciated in

the above judicial decision. Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial

decision, I hold that when an employer of an employee admitted that the services

of an employee were terminated whilst he was on probation, it is the employee

who should commence the case in the Labour Tribunal and not the employer. For

the above reasons, I hold that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal was

wrong when he ordered the Employer-Appellant to commence the case in Labour

Tribunal. I further hold that in the present case, the burden is on the Applicant-

Respondent to establish unjustifiable termination and that the Applicant-

Respondent must establish a prima facie case of mala fides before the Employer-

Appellant was called upon to adduce evidence with regard to the termination. In

the present case the Employer-Appellant was first asked to adduce his reasons for

termination.

For the above reasons I hold that the order of the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal dated 30.9.2011 was wrong and cannot be permitted to stand.

The learned High Court Judge whilst holding that the period of probation of the

Applicant-Respondent was lawfully extended affirmed the order of the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal. For the above reasons, I hold that the learned

High Court Judge was also wrong when he affirmed the order of the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal 30.9.2011.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the 1st and 3rd questions of law in the

affirmative. The 2nd question of law does not arise for consideration.

7

For the above reasons, I set aside the order of the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal dated 30.9.2011 and the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

1.10.2013 and order a retrial. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal is

directed to conclude this case without any delay.

Appeal allowed.
