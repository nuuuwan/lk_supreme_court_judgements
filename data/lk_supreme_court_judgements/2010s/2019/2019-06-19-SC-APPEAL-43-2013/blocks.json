The reasons for non-granting of the writ of certiorari is not enumerated in detail in the judgment, but as seen above the learned judges concur that the cabinet decision moved to be quashed is not a bar to grant the relief sought, as the cabinet decision only pertains to granting of a salary revision to current employees. Clearly, the respondents do not come within the term \u2018current employees\u2019. The respondents were not \u2018present employees as at 27-08-2003, nor retired under normal circumstance after 01-05-2003 but retired under VRS with effect from 31.12.2002\u2019 and specifically excluded from the salary revision. Therefore, the non-issuance of the writ of certiorari and non-granting the principal relief sought from the Court of Appeal is proper and justified. Having correctly refrained from issuing a writ of certiorari in the first instance, the Court of Appeal went on to issue a writ of mandamus, a mandatory order, \u2018directing the 1st to 8th respondents to pay the petitioners their unpaid balance of their arrears of salary revision of year 2000\u2019 aforesaid, on the ground that the petitioners have a substantive legitimate expectation for the payment of their unpaid salary arrears as provided in the Circular P6, upon the basis that the circular P6 has a statutory underpinning and the four former employees have a legitimate expectation in obtaining the benefits accrued to them by the salary revision.",

Thus, on the face of the record four years had lapsed prior to the respondents seeking the discretionary remedy of a writ and no good and valid reasons have been given by the respondents in the petition filed in the Court of Appeal pertaining to same.

The Supreme Court held that the petitioners had a legitimate expectation of receiving extensions up to 60 years (except where medical or disciplinary grounds were present) and further went on to hold that if it is sought to change conditions of service denying the right of extension, the employees should be given a reasonable time and an opportunity of showing cause against change and therefore the decision of the CWE to change the age of retirement is not warranted either upon consideration of public interest or upon principles of fairness and the petitioners were entitled to seek relief for violation of fundamental rights even if there were other remedies to pursue, namely applications to the Labour Tribunal or Arbitration in terms of the CWE Act.",

Prior to holding of the interviews to check the qualifications in order for the petitioners to be enrolled for the said course, upon pressure yielded by the GMOA, holding of the said training course was cancelled and by a circular letter the petitioners were given the option of following another course, a course for paramedical services (pharmacists, medical laboratory technologists, public health inspectors). Based upon the facts it was held that the petitioners had a legitimate expectation that they would upon satisfying prescribed conditions, be provided with a course of training for the examination leading to the award of the certificate of competency as Assistant Medical Practitioners (AMP\u2019s) and the decision effecting a change of policy destroyed the expectations of the petitioners and in deciding of this change of policy only the views of the GMOA was considered and not the views of the AMP\u2019s nor the petitioners and hence the rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution were violated.

    "text": "In the said two cases, a public body has made an unambiguous representation which was subsequently altered due to a policy change or more so as an administrative requirement. The petitioners were not given a hearing nor an opportunity of showing cause and therefore the procedure adopted was flawed and the Supreme Court held that the individual\u2019s legitimate expectation have been affected and that a violation of a fundamental right has taken place. In my view these two cases pertaining to procedural legitimate expectation has no application to the matter before us, as no allegation of a procedural legitimate expectation nor a violation of a fundamental right has been alleged. Therefore, the said cases can be clearly distinguished from the instant writ application in which a writ of mandamus was granted to effect payment of \u2018an unpaid balance of arrears of a salary revision\u2019 allegedly based upon substantive legitimate expectation. The third case relied on by the Court of Appeal is Multinational Property Development Ltd Vs Urban Development Authority 1996 (2) SLR 52, a judgment of the Court of Appeal itself, wherein a decision to lease a land (Charmers Granary in Colombo) on a 99-year lease was subsequently cancelled. In this case the Court held a substantive change in policy resulting from a change in executive presidency cannot be avoided, but where a new policy is to be applied, the individuals who have legitimate expectation based on promises made by public bodies that they will be granted certain benefits, have a right to be heard before those benefits are taken away and directed to give the petitioner a hearing. No writ of mandamus was issued in this case and only a hearing was granted by the Court of Appeal. Thus, this case too can be distinguished from the appeal before us. In the instant appeal, the respondents retired from service on 31.12.2002 under a voluntarily retirement scheme, after accepting and having obtained the compensation package referred to in the circular P5 as a full and final payment and after duly making a declaration to such effect and also that nothing further is due to them (vide 1R5 to 1R8) Therefore, by mutual agreement, the contract of employment between the CPC and the employees were terminated. Eight months after the termination of the employment contract between the 1st appellant and the respondents, the cabinet memorandum (P17) referred to earlier was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for an increase of salaries (upon the basis that overtime work of employees will be curtailed to the minimum so that such increase will be set-off by such curtailment of overtime) and the increase being applicable only to the present employees and to those who have died or retired under normal circumstances on or after 01-05-2003, excluding those who have retired under VRC, which proposal was approved (P16) by the Cabinet of Ministers on 27-08-2003. This was the cabinet decision which their Lordships of the Court of Appeal refrained from quashing by way of a writ of certiorari. Nevertheless, it is observed that the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandamus directing the appellants to make an unspecified payment to the respondents on the ground of substantive legitimate expectation. In issuing the writ of mandamus, the Court of Appeal held that CPC owed a statutory duty to the respondents to make such unspecified payment based upon the penultimate clause of circular P6 which reads thus \u201cwhatever allowances and salary which will fall due after the payment of salary in December 2002 will be paid in the future.\u201d",

Circular P6, covered incidental matters and referred to the statutory payments in detail which the employees opting for VRS would be entitled to and extended the time period of tendering application for VRS and opened it to employees who were earlier excluded and had the above referred clause as the penultimate clause. When issuing the writ of mandamus, the reasoning of the Lordships of Court of Appeal was VRS (P6) was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers; under section 7(1) of the CPC Act the Minister can give general or special directions and the Board should give effect to such directions; the P6 circular has a statutory underpinning; the salary increase cannot be considered as seeking to enforce a contractual right and the employees have a legitimate expectation that the terms and conditions stipulated in P6 would be adhered to by the CPC. Let me now consider the said reasoning. viz-a-viz the seven Questions of Law for which Special Leave was granted by this Court. In my view all Questions of Law weave around the availability of a writ of mandamus. There was no material placed before this Court to substantiate that the VRS was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on the request of the Minister, as stated in the judgment. The circular P5 by which the VRS was offered, issued under the hand of the Chairman/ Managing Director of CPC clearly stated that the VRS is offered by the Management with the concurrence of the General Treasury in view of the award of financial emoluments. Therefore, the attempt to sanctify the circular P5 to the level of a statutory duty of CPC, in my view has no merit and is erroneous. Similarity, circular P6 which covered incidental matters too was not issued as an exercise of power under section 7(1) of the CPC Act. The terms and conditions in the said circular does not have a statutory flavor or a statutory underpinning as stated in the judgement and on that ground too, the judgment is erroneous.",

This is the offer that was accepted by the 1500 employees as a full and final settlement and emoluments based on the last drawn salary. Vide 1R5 to 1R8 the respondents voluntarily accepted the compensation as a full and final settlement based upon the last drawn salary and terminated their contracts of employment and retired from service.
