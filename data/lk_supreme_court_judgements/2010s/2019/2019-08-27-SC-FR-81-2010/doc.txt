P Padman Surasena J

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners at the time of the incident relevant to this case

were serving in the Kurunegala Police Station respectively as the

Headquarters Inspector (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the HQI) and

the officer in charge of the administration branch of Kurunegala police

station.

It is common ground between the parties

i. that the 3rd Respondent was the Senior Superintendent of Police

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the SSP) in charge of

Kurunegala Police division at the relevant time, and

ii. that His Excellency the President of the Republic, by proclamation

published in the gazette had declared that the presidential election

was to be held on 26th January 2010.

The incident relevant to this application had occurred on the 23rd January

2010 which was just two days prior to the said scheduled date (i.e. 26th

January 2010) for the presidential election.

It would be useful at the outset to encapsulate the facts salient to this

case. It is as follows.

7

i. On the 23rd January 2010 the 1st Petitioner being the HQI of

Kurunegala police station had attended a meeting held at the office

of the Deputy Inspector General (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the DIG) in charge of Kurunegala Police Division to discuss about

the security arrangements etc. in the area in view of the impending

presidential election scheduled for 26th January 2010. The DIG –

Kurunegala (Mahesh Samaradivakara), DIG - in charge of Elections

(Anura Senanayake), the SSP - Kurunegala (3rd Respondent) had

been present at the said meeting.

ii. The DIG in charge of Kurunegala Police Division had received around

3.30 PM on 23rd January 2010, a telephone call from a senior lawyer

namely Mr. Felician Perera Attorney-at-law informing him that a lorry

belonging to Sri Lanka Navy bearing registration No. නා. හ. 6284

Was heading towards Kurunegala from Polgahawela carrying

counterfeit ballot papers.

iii. Few minutes later, the 1st Petitioner who was the HQI of Kurunegala

police station also has received the same information through a

telephone call.

8

iv. Acting on the instructions of the DIG in charge of Kurunegala Police

Division, the 1st Petitioner had taken steps to deploy a team of police

officers led by the 2nd Petitioner (who was the Officer in charge of

administration of Kurunegala police station) to set up a road block

near the office of the SSP in Kurunegala. The said team of police

officers had commenced checking on the passing by vehicles.

v. As the meeting had ended around 4.15 PM, the 1st Petitioner had left

the DIG’s office and had taken steps to give necessary instructions to

the 2nd Petitioner regarding the apprehension of persons in the

suspected vehicle.

vi. Consequently, around 5.10 PM, the team of police officers led by the

2nd Petitioner has taken the above numbered lorry (along with three

Navy personnel who had been travelling in the lorry) into custody at

a location close to a place called Wehara Junction. Shortly thereafter,

the 1st Petitioner also had arrived at that location.

vii. Thereafter, acting on the instructions of the 3rd Respondent, the

apprehended suspects and the lorry had been brought to Kurunegala

Police Station. At that time, Superintendent of Police Nagahamulla

and the 3rd Respondent also had come to the Police Station.

9

viii. Soon thereafter Mr. Jayawickrama Perera, a member of the

opposition of then parliament along with a group of his supporters

including Mr. Felician Perera Attorney-at-law (who provided the

information) had arrived at the Police Station.

ix. An intense argument had then ensued between the 3rd respondent

and the group of people led by the Member of Parliament who had

insisted that the apprehended lorry should be inspected. Pursuant to

this argument, the 3rd Respondent had reluctantly permitted the

inspection of the lorry.

x. Although counterfeit ballot papers (referred to in the information

received) had not been found, the police had found the following

items stacked inside the lorry;

i) A stock of liquor stored in crates and boxes,

ii) 24 bundles of handbills titled “හදුනාගත්තාත ඔබ මා”

(produced marked P 6) and

“කව්ද ්ේ ...?

කව්ද ්ේ ...?

කව්ද ්ේ ...?” (Produced marked P 7).

10

These items had been covered with several empty metal barrels. A

collection of photographs of these items including the lorry has been

produced marked P 1. A compact disk (CD) containing the images of

the said items in a video has also been produced marked P 2. The

contents of the handbills found in the lorry had been printed in both

Sinhala and Tamil languages. The said handbills had not disclosed

any information leading to the identification of their author or

publisher.

xi. At about 6 PM, Mr. Jayarathne Herath a Minister serving in the then

government along with a group of his supporters had rushed to the

scene. An altercation had then ensued between the said Minister and

the aforesaid Member of Parliament. At that stage, the DIG-

Kurunegala and DIG-Elections also had arrived at that place.

xii. The politicians who had gathered there had left the police station

upon an undertaking given by the DIG-Elections to deal with the

defamatory publications according to law. The politicians had left the

scene leaving behind a person who was found busy making

telephone calls to various persons.

11

xiii. Around 8 PM, the 3rd Respondent had directed the 1st Petitioner to

record statements from three Navy personnel, take into custody the

previously mentioned defamatory publications and then release the

lorry. Copies of the statements given by the Navy personnel have

been produced marked P 3. The DIG-Elections (Anura Senanayake),

had also made an entry regarding the said incident in the Officers

Visiting Book maintained at the Kurunegala Police station, a copy of

which has been produced marked P 4.

xiv. After the superior officers left the scene the 3rd respondent having

had several telephone conversations with several people, to the

surprise of the petitioners, had directed the 1st Petitioner to release

the stock of liquor and defamatory publications along with the lorry.

xv. The Petitioners had reminded the 3rd Respondent that they would be

subjected to disciplinary action if they release the defamatory

publications after which the 3rd Respondent himself had taken the

key of the lorry and thrown it towards the Navy personnel.

xvi. The said Navy personnel drove away in the lorry with the said

defamatory publications after they were re-loaded on to the lorry

under the personal supervision of the 3rd Respondent.

12

xvii. Around 9 PM, the person by the name of Prabath who was left

behind by the above mentioned Minister, had abused the Petitioners

in filth and threatened them that they would be dealt with after the

conclusion of the presidential election.

xviii. The entries made in the Officers’ Visiting Book maintained at the

Kurunegala police station by Superintendent of Police Nagahamulla

and the 3rd Respondent have been produced marked P 9(a) and P

9(b) respectively.

xix. About 1 week after the conclusion of the presidential election, by the

fax dated 6th February 2010, 110 police officers including the 1st

Petitioner had been transferred with immediate effect. (Fax dated 6th

February 2010 has been produced marked P 10). According to P 10,

the 1st Petitioner has been transferred to a supernumerary position at

the Sri Lanka Police College in Kalutara based on exigencies of the

service. The Ministry of Defence and Public Security and Law and

Order had approved the said transfer.

xx. Upon an order of the Inspector General of Police bearing No. D/MD

/ADM/73/2010 dated 6th February 2010; the 2nd Petitioner has been

13

transferred to Trincomalee. This communication has been produced

marked P 11.

The Petitioners complain that the above transfers effected immediately

after the conclusion of the presidential election 2010 are arbitrary, mala

fide and executed for collateral purposes. It is on this basis that they

complain that the fundamental rights guaranteed to them under Articles

12(1) and or 12 (2) of the Constitution have been infringed.

Although, the Petitioners in the prayers of their petition have prayed for a

declaration by this Court that their fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution have been violated, this Court

when this application was supported on 01-03-2010, having heard the

submissions of the learned counsel for the Petitioners and the submissions

of the learned State Counsel who appeared for the Respondents, had

decided to grant leave to proceed only under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Thus, the task of this Court at this moment must be restricted

only to ascertain whether anyone or more of the Respondents have

infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

14

It would be opportune at this juncture to consider the position taken up by

the respondents. Both Mr. Mahinda Balasuriya then Inspector General of

Police who is the 1st Respondent and Mr. Vaas Gunawardena then SSP -

Kurunegala (3rd Respondent) have filed affidavits. They in the said

affidavits have admitted the following facts;

i. There was a meeting held on the 23rd January 2010 with the

presence of the 1st Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent along with

other senior officers to discuss about the security arrangements etc.

in the area in view of the impending presidential election scheduled.

ii. While the said meeting was going on around 3.30 PM, the Deputy

Inspector General in charge of Northwestern Province - East had

received a telephone call from a person identified as Felician Perera

Attorney-at-law informing him that a vehicle bearing registration No.

නා. හ. 6284 was being used to transport counterfeit ballot papers.

iii. Thereafter, the Deputy Inspector General in charge of Northwestern

Province - East had instructed the 1st Petitioner to take the said

vehicle into custody.

15

iv. The 2nd Petitioner had consequently taken the above numbered lorry

into custody and had brought the said lorry to Kurunegala Police

Station.

v. At the time, the said lorry was brought to Kurunegala Police Station,

a crowd had gathered there and among them were Mr. Gamini

Jayawickrema Perera a Member of Parliament and Mr. Jayaratne

Herath a Minister in the then government along with their supporters.

vi. The unrest which prevailed at that time had been solved by DIG

(Northwestern Province - East) and DIG (crimes). The 3rd Respondent

had also been present there at that time. The respondents have

produced the relevant part of the notes made by the 3rd Respondent

marked 1R1.

vii. Upon the inspection of the said lorry, they had not found any

counterfeit ballot papers. However, they had found 24 bundles of

handbills criticizing the presidential election candidate Mr. Sarath

Fonseka and some goods meant for the welfare of Navy officers in

the lorry.

16

viii. At this instance the DIG (Northwestern Province - East) had

instructed the 3rd Respondent to release the lorry and the Navy

personnel after retaining few handbills as samples and after

recording statements of the said Navy personnel. Relevant notes

made by the DIG has been produced marked 1R2.

ix. The 3rd Respondent had accordingly instructed the 1st and 2nd

Petitioners to follow the instructions of the DIG.

x. The 1st Petitioner had refused to follow the said instructions, and

had entered into an argument with a person amongst the gathering,

and had left the scene without obeying the instructions given by the

3rd Respondent. Relevant notes made by the 3rd Respondent has

been produced marked 1R3.

xi. The 1st and 2nd Petitioners were subsequently issued with charge

sheets, which have been produced marked 1R4 and 1R5.

The position taken up by then Inspector General of Police Mr. Mahinda

Balasuriya regarding the transfers of the Petitioners are set out in

paragraph 8(x) of his affidavit. It is as follows.

“considering the fact that the 1st Petitioner as the HQI and the 2nd

Petitioner being the OIC of the Kurunegala Police Station had a

17

misunderstanding with the 3rd Respondent, over insubordination moreover

explained as above, the 1st and 2nd Petitioners were transferred out of the

Division of the 3rd Respondent, on exigency of services, namely for the

smooth functioning of the Police service within the SSP’s Division.”

It was the position of the then IGP that it was for administrative

convenience that the names of the Petitioners were included in a common

list of officers to be transferred.

It would be appropriate at this juncture to briefly outline the counter

arguments advanced by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (who will

hereinafter sometimes be referred to as DSG) who appeared for the

Respondents. It was the submission of the learned DSG that the

Respondents have effected the transfers of the Petitioners based on

exigencies of service. Learned DSG further submitted that the conduct of

the Petitioners showing disobedience and insubordination in refusing to

carry out orders given by the superior officers was the primary fact, which

precipitated the Respondents to have the Petitioners transferred out of

Kurunegala Police Division on the given basis. Moreover, it was the

submission of the learned DSG that the transfer of the Petitioners out of

18

Kurunegala Police Division became necessary to maintain the proper

working atmosphere and the chain of command in the police service.

At the very outset of the process of evaluation of the arguments placed by

the parties before this Court, it would be relevant to bear in mind that the

Respondents do not deny that the Petitioners had taken into custody,

copies of some publications defamatory to one of the candidates for the

presidential election scheduled to be held on 26th January 2010.

Admittedly, this detection had been made on the 23rd January 2010 which

was just two days prior to the said scheduled date (i.e. 26th January 2010)

of the said election.

In view of the submission made by the learned DSG that the primary fact,

which precipitated the Respondents to transfer the Petitioners was the

disobedience and insubordination of the Petitioners in refusing to carry out

orders given by the superior officers to release the items ceased, it would

be necessary to first consider whether the Petitioners were obliged in law

to carry out the said instructions. Since what is in issue is an election

related incident, I would commence this discussion by referring to some of

the relevant provisions of the Presidential Elections Act.

19

According to section 72 of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981,

‘every person who, not being a candidate, prints, publishes, distributes or

posts up, or causes to be printed, published, distributed or posted up, any

advertisement, handbill, placard or poster which refers to an election and

which does not bear upon its face the names and addresses of its printer

and publisher, shall be guilty of an offence.’

It would be relevant to recall at this stage that the 24 bundles of printed

handbills produced marked P 6 and P 7 referred to a candidate of the

presidential election, which was to be held in two days’ time, and the said

handbills did not bear upon its face, the names and addresses of their

printer and publisher. Thus, whoever had caused the said handbills printed,

published or distributed is guilty of an offence under section 72 of the Act.

Further, section 68 of the said Act has prohibited doing certain acts on a

polling day. The part relevant would be section 68. (1) which is as follows.

“no person shall, on any date on which a poll is taken at a polling station,

do any of the following acts within the precincts, or a distance of a half a

kilometer of the entrance, of that polling station:

(a) Canvassing for votes;

20

(b) soliciting the vote of any elector;

(c) persuading any elector not to vote for any particular candidate;

(d) persuading any elector not to vote at the election;

(e) distributing or exhibiting any handbill placard, poster, photograph or

drawing or notice relating to the election (other than any official handbill,

placard, poster, photograph or drawing or notice) or any symbol allotted

under section 20 to any candidate.”

I must also take into account the general provisions in section 71 of the Act

relating to some offences including an offence under section 68. According

to that section [S. 71. (1)] every person who attempts to commit an

offence specified in section 68 shall also be liable to the punishment

prescribed for that offence.

It is also relevant to note that section 71 (2) of the Act has made every

offence under section 68 or section 69 a cognizable offence within the

meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979.

Section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 states that

it is lawful for any peace officer to arrest without an order from a Magistrate

and without a warrant any person who has been concerned in any cognizable

21

offence or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible

information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having

been so concerned.

It must also be noted that according to section 56 of the Police Ordinance

No. 16 of 1865 as amended, every police officer is under a duty to use his

best endeavors and ability to prevent all crimes and offences, and to

detect, apprehend and bring all offenders to justice.

Taking into consideration the above factual and legal material, I am of the

view that in the given instance there was sufficient material and justifiable

grounds for the Petitioners to arrest the three Navy personnel who had

been concerned in a cognizable offence. Thus, the Petitioners had

performed their duty well within law. Their actions are nothing but what

the law of the country had expected of them.

However, the 3rd Respondent had admittedly directed the Petitioners to

release the said offenders. The 3rd Respondent has not assigned any

acceptable reason for this blatant violation of the prevailing provisions of

the law. In the light of the above material it is not difficult for this Court to

hold that the orders, the 3rd Respondent has given to the Petitioners, are

clearly illegal. The 3rd Respondent had not heeded even the reluctance or

22

the protest of the Petitioners to carry out his illegal orders. The 3rd

Respondent upon the said reluctance of the Petitioners to carry out his

illegal orders had forcibly taken the key of the lorry from the Petitioners

and given it to the offenders enabling the offenders to drive away with

impunity. Not being contented with that, the 3rd Respondent had thereafter

taken steps to charge the Petitioners for insubordination. Alas! The only

alleged offence committed by the Petitioners is enforcement of the

provisions in the prevailing law of the land as law enforcement officers and

refusing to carry out illegal orders of a superior officer.

Moreover, it was submitted to this Court by the learned President’s Counsel

for the Petitioners that the inquiring officer, subsequent to the disciplinary

inquiry held against the Petitioners, has exonerated the Petitioners from all

the charges framed against them. This is despite the admission by both

parties of the issuance of the relevant order by the 3rd Respondent and the

refusal to carry it out by the Petitioners.

It would be opportune at this juncture to refer to an interesting judicial

precedent on a similar question.

23

The question whether a soldier is bound to obey illegal order given by his

superior came to the fore in the case of A. Wijesuriya and another Vs The

State.1

The first appellant in that case Lieutenant Wijesuriya, a member of the

volunteer force of the Army was the commander of the platoon sent to

Kataragama on 16-04-1971, few days after that area was overrun and held

by the insurgents for few days. The second Appellant was the second in

command of the said platoon.

Both those appellants were indicted on two separate counts for having

committed the offences of attempted murder of Premawathie Manamperi

by shooting her with Sterling sub-machine guns and causing serious

injuries to her on 17-04-1971. Both appellants were unanimously convicted

by the jury. The defense raised by the appellants at the trial was a defence

under section 69 of the Penal Code on the premise that they acted under

the orders of their superior officers. The first appellant being the

commander of the said platoon took up the position that he had received

orders to “bump off” the deceased, from his superior officer Colonel

1 77 NLR 25.

24

Nugawela who was the Co-coordinating Officer for Hambantota district at

the relevant time.

The 2nd appellant in that case sought to draw a difference with regard

to his culpability on the basis that he only (unlike the 1st appellant

who received the order to shoot the deceased on the previous day)

received the order to shoot the deceased at the very time of the shooting

took place, from the first Appellant who was his immediate superior

(commander of his platoon) and was therefore compelled to act on that

spur of the moment.

The Court of Criminal Appeal2 held that under section 100 of the Army Act

(Chapter 357) every person subject to Military Law3 is only bound to

obey the lawful commands given personally by his superior officers.

On this basis the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the order to shoot

the deceased who was indeed arrested by Police, and was kept in

custody, being manifestly and obviously an unlawful command, the

2 Chief Justice of the island of Ceylon and Puisne Justices of the Supreme Court were the judges of that Court (vide section 2 of the Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance). 3 Vide section 34 of the Army Act.

25

appellants were not entitled to succeed with their defense even under the

Military law.

The Court of Criminal Appeal on the above basis affirmed the conviction of

both the appellants in that case.

Moreover, this Court, in the case of Deshapriya Vs Rukmani, Divisional

Secretary, Dodangoda and others,4 also has echoed similar views. The 3rd

Respondent in that case who was the Deputy Speaker and a Member of

then Parliament, had summoned the Petitioner of that case, a Samurdhi

Niyamaka, along with all the other Samurdhi Niyamakas of Dodangoda

Divisional Secretary’s Division to attend a meeting presided over by him. In

the said meeting the said 3rd Respondent (the Deputy Speaker and Member

of Parliament) had instructed the Petitioner and the other Samurdhi

Niyamakas to canvass amongst the people whom they work with, for

support for the People’s Alliance candidates for the then impending

election. The said Petitioner had declined to follow the said instructions

given by the said 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent (Deputy Speaker)

had then complained to then Minister of Samurdhi, Youth Affairs and

Sports that the said Petitioner had espoused his political opinion in a public

4 1999 (2) Sri L R 412.

26

meeting presided over by him. Upon that complaint, then Minister of

Samurdhi, Youth Affairs and Sports had instructed the Commissioner

General of Samurdhi (2nd Respondent in that case) to suspend the services

of the Petitioner in that case with immediate effect. The Commissioner

General of Samurdhi then suspended the services of the said Petitioner

with immediate effect. The sole reason for the said suspension was the fact

that the said Petitioner had spoken against the instructions given by the

said Deputy Speaker.

This Court having considered the material adduced in that case has stated

in its judgment as follows.

“ ..... As far as the 2nd and 3rd Respondents were concerned, it was not just

a case of a suspension for which there was no reason, but one which they

knew full well was for a wholly bad reason. That reason was, unashamedly,

stated in the letter “A”, and it was obvious to them that a suspension for

that reason was both unlawful and a gross abuse of power. The 2nd

Respondent may have acted - as he says in his affidavit - only because he

was ordered to do so by the Minister of Samurdhi, but he should have

known that that was an unlawful order which it was his duty to refuse to

obey”. …. “

27

In the instant case, the 3rd Respondent has admitted that he had given

directions to the Petitioners to release the handbills, lorry and Navy

personnel on the instructions of his (3rd Respondent’s) superiors.

It is the position of the 3rd Respondent that his superiors having consulted

the Hon. Attorney General had decided that no offence had been

constituted at the given instance. This Court notes that Hon. Attorney

General has been named as the 5th Respondent in the instant case and that

no such position has ever been taken up by him at any stage of this case.

The learned DSG who appeared for the Hon. Attorney General at no stage

informed this Court that Hon. Attorney General was indeed consulted in

this instance or that he took such view.

What the 3rd Respondent in his notes (P 9(b)) has stated is that DIG

Anura Senanyaka had telephoned him and informed him that Hon.

Attorney General, upon a query (whether the facts in this instance had

constituted an offence) made by the 1st Respondent (IGP), had informed

him that no offence had been constituted. According to the 3rd Respondent,

it was on that basis that the 1st Respondent had instructed him to release

the items and persons in custody.

28

However, to the surprise of this Court, the 1st Respondent (IGP) in the

affidavit filed by him in this case has not adverted to any such position

either directly or indirectly. This means that the 3rd Respondent’s position,

which is only reflected in his notes as mere hearsay material, has not even

been supported by the 1st Respondent (IGP) who is said to have given the

questionable directions.

In any case, the Hon. Attorney General who was before this Court did not

support such factual or legal position. Moreover, in any case the Attorney

General in all probability could not have had in his hand any material by

that time to study and asses the evidence available or the circumstances

leading to this detection in its correct perspective before forming any such

opinion. Thus, this Court is of the view that the Respondents have not

established by any degree of proof, the fact that the Attorney General was

consulted or that he provided the purported advice in this regard. Further,

while it is not the position of the 1st Respondent (IGP) that he gave such

instructions, there is also no other support forthcoming from any quarter,

for the 3rd Respondent’s position. This has left the 3rd Respondent to stand

or fall with his own version.

29

In these circumstances, this Court refuses to accept the position that any

of the senior Police officers had consulted the Hon. Attorney General

before giving questionable directions or that Hon. Attorney General in fact

gave such opinion.

Furthermore, if the 3rd Respondent had indeed received such instructions

from his superiors, this Court notes with regret that the 3rd Respondent had

chosen (unlike the Petitioners) to unhesitatingly and promptly carry out

such illegal instructions. Such a situation is pathetic especially in the face of

the ability to understand the illegal nature of these instructions by the

Petitioners who are the subordinates of the 3rd Respondent.

Further, this Court is of the view that the case at hand and the given set of

facts and law applicable to this instance is not complex to the extent that it

would have required the prompt attention and advice of Hon. Attorney

General.

Moreover, as has been held in the case of Deshapriya Vs Rukmani,

Divisional Secretary, Dodangoda and others,5 (Samurdhi Niyamaka’s case)

use of the resources of the state including human resources for the benefit

5 Supra.

30

of one political party or group is considered unequal treatment because

such an unauthorized use would confer an unlawful advantage to one

political party or group when a similar facility is denied to its rivals. In the

instant case, the state vehicle had been used to transport handbills of the

kind prohibited by election laws of the country.

It is to be noted that during the time relevant to the incident pertaining to

this case the 17th Amendment to the Constitution was in operation. Article

104 B (4) therein had empowered the Election Commission to prohibit

during the period of an election, the use of any movable or immovable

property belonging to the State or any public corporation -

i. For the purpose of promoting or preventing the election of any

candidate or any political party or independent group contesting

at such election;

ii. by any candidate or any political party or any independent

group contesting at such election.

This could have been done by a direction in writing by the Chairman of the

Commission or of the Commissioner General of Elections on the instruction

of the Commission. Once such a direction is made, every person or officer

31

in whose custody or under whose control such property is for the time

being, was duty bound6 to comply with and give effect to such direction.

The Petitioners have drawn the attention of this Court to such notification

(marked P 14,) issued by the Election Commissioner. It is clear even as

per the said directive the respondents could not have lawfully decided to

release the lorry, which is a state property as it had been used for

purposes, referred to in that directive (P 14,).

Considering the above material, it is the view of this Court that this was not

an instance where the respondents should have released at that time itself,

the suspects or the handbills in their custody. This is particularly so when

the presidential election was just two days away. Releasing the suspects

along with those handbills at that time could only have paved the way for

their distribution as may have been planned by those who were behind it in

the eve of the Election Day.

Be that as it may, even if one were to assume that the 3rd Respondent had

received such instructions, it would suffice for this Court to state here that

the 3rd Respondent has not had any semblance of the forthrightness his

subordinate officers had displayed at this instance when they refused to

32

carry out such manifestly illegal instructions. If the 3rd Respondent had, in

fact received such illegal instructions from his superiors, he was entitled

and should have refused to carry out such illegal instructions in the same

way his subordinate officers had rightly done.

Since the position taken up by the respondents is that the Petitioners were

transferred on the exigencies of the service, reproducing a passage from

the judgment of this Court in the case of Tennakoon, Assistant

Superintendent of Police Vs T. P. F. De Silva, Inspector General of Police

and Others7 would be relevant. That is also a case, which dealt with the

term ‘exigency of service’. The said passage is as follows.

“…..Thus the issue for decision becomes narrowed down to this: is this

Court bound, or even entitled, to accept the 1st Respondent’s subjective

assertion as to the lack of a satisfactory working relationship - especially

where that is only the unverified and unsupported conclusion of his

subordinate? In my opinion, however wide the 1st Respondent's discretion,

he cannot simply say that he ordered a transfer "because of the exigencies

of service", or "for disciplinary reasons", or "in the interests of the service",

or "because of the lack of a harmonious working relationship", and expect

33

this Court blindly to accept that assertion. While it is true that Article 126

does not authorize this Court to usurp the 1st Respondent's discretion in

regard to transfers, yet it does not allow this Court to accept a mere

assertion of that sort - for that would be to abdicate its duty to examine

whether the 1st Respondent's conduct fell short of the norms mandated by

the fundamental rights, and thus indirectly to invent a new official

immunity Senanayake v. Mahindasoma8. Let me add that, of course,

different considerations would apply where national security is involved. …“

Fernando J in the above case, went on to state thus, ‘If a police officer

may, with impunity, be transferred on that ground (without any need to

consider the reasons for it) what signals would that give, firstly, to the

transferred officer as to how he should perform his duties in his new

station, and secondly, to his replacement? To act according to law in the

public interest or to avoid an unsatisfactory working relationship at all

costs? As, for instance, by giving in to an unlawful request either to stifle

an investigation into or a prosecution for an offence, or to pursue a

frivolous and vexatious charge? The power to transfer exists in order to

ensure an efficient service to the public, but without imposing an unfair

34

burden on individual public officers. Transfer on the ground of

unsatisfactory working relationship will not only be unfair to the individual

but will promote inefficiency and injustice……’

Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows;

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law”.

As has been set out above, the Petitioners were entitled in law to refuse to

carry out the illegal instructions they had received to release the handbills,

lorry and the Navy Personnel they had taken into custody. It necessarily

follows that Respondents are not entitled in law to allege insubordination

and subsequently to charge the Petitioners for insubordination on that

account. According to the Respondents, it is this so-called insubordination,

which had precipitated the Respondents to transfer the Petitioners.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that there had been no

exigency of the kind alleged by the Respondents. Therefore, the

submission of the Respondents that the Petitioners had to be transferred

on the exigency of the service must fail.

35

Further, the above facts disclose clearly that the transfers effected soon

after the presidential election on the guise of exigencies of service have

been effected arbitrarily, illegally and for collateral purposes. It is therefore

the view of this Court that the transfers of the Petitioners, subsequent

preferring of charge sheets against them and conducting disciplinary

proceedings against the Petitioners are all ab initio void and hence are

hereby declared null and void.

Considering all the above material in its totality, this Court is of the view

that the 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent in the given situation had

acted arbitrarily, outside the law and had violated, the fundamental rights

guaranteed to the Petitioners under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides

that the Petitioners are entitled to a declaration by this Court that their

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have

been infringed.

Hence, this Court decides to

36

I. declare that the 1st and 3rd Respondents have violated the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution;

II. declare that the aforesaid purported transfers of the Petitioners

reflected in P 10 and P 11 are illegal and hence null and void;

This Court thinks this is a fit occasion to commend the forthrightness

displayed by the Petitioners even in the face of the aforementioned

adversary circumstances. There is no doubt that they had undergone a

difficult time for mere upholding the rule of law in the country. Therefore,

this Court decides to award a compensation in a sum of Rs. 1,000,000/= to

each of the Petitioners payable by the 1st Respondent and the 3rd

Respondent in equal shares.

Further, this Court directs that the Petitioners must be deemed for all

purposes to have continued to be in service in the ranks they were

respectively holding at the time of this incident without a break in service.

They will be entitled to all the arrears of their salaries and allowances as

well as benefits, which their colleagues would have received during that

period in terms of salary, increments, promotions etc.

37

This Court also directs the Inspector General of Police and the Police

Commission to take necessary suitable steps to redress any disadvantage,

which may have accrued to the Petitioners regarding their promotions due

to their being unlawfully subjected to disciplinary proceedings relating to

this incident.

Petitioners are entitled to the costs of this application.

Application is allowed with costs.
