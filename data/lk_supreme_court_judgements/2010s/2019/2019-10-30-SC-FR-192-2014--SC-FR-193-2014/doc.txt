Aluwihare, PC, J.

The Petitioner in SC FR Application 192/2014, an undergraduate of the Allied

Health Sciences Faculty, University of Peradeniya following a course in Laboratory

Sciences complained of the violation of his fundamental rights under Article 10,

11, 12 (1), 13 (1), 13 (2), 13 (5) and 14 (1) (a) of the Constitution primarily by

the 1st Respondent, Officer-in-Charge of the Slave Island Police Station. Twelve

other undergraduates following the same course, the Petitioners in SC FR

Application 193/2014, complained of the violation of their fundamental rights

under the identical Articles of the Constitution referred to above. Leave to proceed

in both Applications was granted for the alleged violations of Article 11 and 13 (1).

In view of the fact that it was the same incident that gave rise to the violations

alleged, both Applications were considered together in a single judgment. For ease

of reference, the Petitioner in SC FR 192/2014 is referred to as “Petitioner Dinuka

Madushan” and Petitioners in the Application No 193/2014 as “Petitioners in

Application 193”.

According to the Petitioners, after having taken part in a protest campaign and

satyagraha held in front of the University Grants Commission on the 16th of May

2014, calling for the re-introduction of a 4-year Allied Health Science Degree, the

Petitioners had boarded a bus to travel to Fort.

While the Petitioners were on the bus, two individuals in civilian clothes who

claimed to be Police Officers had directed the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan to

disembark, stating that there was a warrant for his arrest. When asked to be shown

the warrant, a photocopy of a warrant had been shown to the Petitioner Madushan.

The particular warrant, however, had been issued against another person, namely

one Prabashana Rajapaksa and not the Petitioner. Upon the Petitioner producing

his National Identity card and indicating that he was not the person named in the

warrant, the said individuals had left the Petitioner alone and had moved to

another part of the bus.

6

A while after this confrontation, the Petitioners had become aware that the bus was

being diverted from its designated route. Amidst protests from the other passengers

the bus had been driven to the Slave Island Police Station. Approximately 10 police

officers in uniform and a cordon of officers in civilian clothing as well as a senior

Police Officer had surrounded the bus and all the passengers had been directed to

disembark. Accordingly, the Petitioners in Application 193 had also disembarked.

They had observed that one of the officers in civilian clothing who had earlier

attempted to execute the warrant against Petitioner Dinuka Madushan, in

discussion with the senior Police Officer. As the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan was

disembarking, he had been informed by the same senior police officer that there

was a warrant for his arrest. When the Petitioner stated that the said warrant was

not issued against him, he had been shown the original of the warrant, which had

been torn in two. The Petitioner had again produced his National Identity Card and

had made an attempt to explain that the warrant was in respect of another

individual. The Police had then taken his National Identity Card which was later

returned to the Petitioner. Upon the senior officer’s insistence on arresting the

Petitioner some of the students who were with the Petitioner, including the

Petitioners in Application 193/2014 had repeatedly told the police officers that

the Petitioner should not be arrested as he had not been involved in the commission

of any offence.

At this point, according to the Petitioners, the police officers who were present had

appeared to be angered by the reaction of the students. According to the Petitioners,

some of them had been dragged away using force while subjecting them to assault.

The 1st Petitioner in Application 193, Nadish Ranatunga also asserts that during

this incident, he was dragged away and then surrounded and assaulted by several

police officers in civilian clothing. According to the said Petitioner, he had been

kicked and dealt blows with the fists, and as a result of the attack he had fallen.

Two police officers in civilian clothing had then dragged the Petitioner into the

Police Station.

7

According to the Petitioners, when they were inside the Police Station, several other

uniformed Police Officers had assaulted the 1st, 11th and 12th Petitioners in

Application 193. Thereafter, all the Petitioners had been detained in the Police cell.

After the assault, the Petitioner Nadish Ranatunge had felt dizzy and had also felt

that his vision of the left eye was blurred. The said Petitioner asserts that regardless

of the fact that he was bleeding from his left eye and mouth by this time, his

requests for medical treatment had been ignored by the Police.

According to the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan, he too had been dragged into the

police station while being assaulted by police officers in civilian clothing and

detained in the police cell. Soon after, he had been summoned to the office of the

1st Respondent and in the presence of three other senior police officers, informed

that even though the name on the warrant was wrong, it was issued for his arrest

based on a photograph. He was shown a photograph of himself captioned with the

name mentioned in the warrant, “Prabashana Rajapakse”. Thereafter, the twelve

Petitioners in Application 193 were summoned, and the same information relayed

to them as well. They were further informed that the Petitioner, Dinuka Madushan

had to be detained due to the warrant and the rest of the students had to be detained

for obstructing his arrest.

Afterwards, statements had been recorded from all the Petitioners. At around 11.30

p.m. the same day they had been produced before the Fort Magistrate. The

Magistrate had directed that they be referred for examination by the Judicial

Medical Officer and be remanded until produced before the court on the following

Monday, 19th May 2014. The Petitioners had then been taken to the New Magazine

Remand Prison.

On the following day i.e. 17th May 2014, the Petitioner and the other students had

been produced before a Judicial Medical Officer and two other doctors at the

National Hospital. Four of the Petitioners, the 4th, 6th, 9th and 11th Petitioners in

Application 193, were admitted to the National Hospital on medical advice while

8

the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan and the other Petitioners were advised to be

admitted to the Prison Hospital. On their return to the Remand Prison the Petitioner

Dinuka Madushan had also been admitted to the Prison Hospital until he was

produced before the Magistrate’s Court, Fort on 19th May 2014. The Petitioner,

Nadish Ranathunge (a Petitioner in Application 193) had been given a referral to

have his eye examined at the National Hospital.

The Diagnosis Tickets of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 11th Petitioners in 193 which have

been produced in these proceedings indicate that all 4 Petitioners were warded at

the National Hospital and had complained of trauma to the head due to assault.

According to the Patient Assessment Sheet issued by the National Hospital to the 4th

Petitioner Janith Kalana, his “vital signs” had been stable and “no neurological”

signs had been recorded. He had been subjected to a X-Ray and it is noted in the

Sheet that, “cervical spine-clinically normal” and “no orthopedic intervention”

meaning no orthopedic treatment was required. Similarly, according to the Patient

Assessment Sheet of the 6th Petitioner Buddhika Dilshan, he also has complained of

trauma to the head following assault. It is recorded in the Assessment Sheet that

there were “no neurological signs” and in addition, “the spine is clinically normal”

and “no orthopedic intervention” according to the X-Ray reports.

The findings recorded in the Patient Assessment Sheet of the 9th Petitioner

Priyantha Dinesh who also had complained of head injury following assault, is no

different to the other two referred to earlier. The X-Ray of his cervical spine had

shown that it was clinically normal, and it is also recorded that there were

“clinically no other injuries or issues”. The Patient Assessment Sheet of the 11th

Petitioner Tharindu Sampath again carries similar findings although he too has

given a history of head injury following assault. As far as the 11th Petitioner was

concerned, his X-Ray findings indicate that both his spine as well as the cervical

spine had been “clinically normal” and “no orthopedic intervention” was required.

The 3rd Petitioner Hashan Dhananjaya had given a history of assault by the police

9

with bare hands to the scrotum which is recorded so in the Diagnosis Ticket issued

to him on 19th of May 2014 (marked ‘P6a’). The following is recorded on his

Diagnosis Ticket: “both testicles normal, no hydrocele and no orthopedic

problems”. It appears that none of the medical records produced on behalf of the

Petitioners support the allegation that they were dealt fist blows, kicked and

dragged.

On 19th May 2014, the Petitioners who were not warded at the National Hospital,

namely the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and

12th Petitioners in 193 had been produced before the Fort Magistrate and had been

released on bail under case number B/955/14. The officers of the Slave Island

Police had informed the Magistrate that the Petitioner in 192/2014 was needed

for the case bearing B/7542/1/14, the case in which a warrant is purported to

have been issued against him by the Chief Magistrate, Colombo.

The Petitioner Dinuka Madushan had been produced before the Chief Magistrate’s

Court along with several others regarding case B/7542/1/14 in which it was

alleged that a warrant had been issued against the Petitioner. The Petitioner and

the others produced with him, however, had been enlarged on bail by the learned

magistrate.

On the same day the 1st Petitioner in Application193, (Nadish Ranathunga) had

got himself admitted to Ward 72 at the National Hospital. In his Diagnosis Ticket

at the National Hospital (marked ‘P5a’) it is recorded that he had “sub conjunctival

hemorrhage- glaucoma suspected”. After being examined at the Eye Hospital on

the 20th May 2014, the Petitioner had received treatment at the National Hospital

until 22nd May 2014.

After being informed by some students that an investigation regarding this incident

of arrest and assault was being conducted by the Mirihana Police on 26th May

2014, the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan and all the Petitioners in Application 193

except the 1st Petitioner had reported to the Mirihana Police station where their

10

statements had been recorded. The Petitioners assert that no further steps have

been taken over their complaints.

In the objections filed by the 1st Respondent, the Officer in Charge of the Slave

Island Police Station, it is stated that on the 16th of May, 2014 the 1st Respondent

was instructed via telephone by the Deputy Director of the Colombo Crime

Division to assist in the arrest of a person against whom a warrant had been issued

by the Chief Magistrate and that the person concerned was, at the time, travelling

in a bus plying via Slave Island.

The 1st Respondent states that even though the name on the National Identity card

of the Petitioner and the name on the warrant were not identical, the Officers of

the Colombo Crime Division and the Intelligence Bureau of the Western Province

who had been on the bus had shown him a photograph of the Petitioner, and the

Assistant Superintendent of Police from the Intelligence Bureau of the Western

Province had confirmed that the Petitioner was the person in the photograph and

had instructed him to arrest the Petitioner. He also states that he is only aware of

the fact that the application for obtaining the warrant had been made by the

Cinnamon Gardens Police Station.

The 1st Respondent denies the contention that he insisted on arresting the Petitioner

and arrested him by force. The Petitioner had been requested to come inside the

Police Station and clarify any confusion that might be there. At that point the

students who were with the Petitioner had behaved in an aggressive manner. This

had led the police officers to arrest the Petitioner and his colleagues with the use

of minimum force, for obstructing the police officers from carrying out their duties.

In Paragraph 48 of the extract from the Information Book of the Colombo Crime

Division Unit 6 (marked ‘R6a1’) Inspector of Police Hettiarchchi has recorded that

when the 1st Respondent attempted to arrest the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan,

about 15 students had obstructed the arrest by directing blows at him and pulling

at his uniform. It is also recorded that at this point, the police officers of the Slave

11

Island Police Station had come to the assistance of the 1st Respondent and had

subdued those attacking the 1st Respondent and taken them into the Police Station.

Excerpts from the Information Book of the Slave Island Police Station (marked ‘R9a’

& ‘R9b’) indicate that some Police Officers also had sustained injuries in the

altercation between the Petitioners and the Police.

It is contended by the 1st Respondent that, the Petitioner with the injured eye, had

that injury on him at the time he was arrested, and that the Petitioner did not

sustain the injury in the process of arresting. The 1st Respondent rejects the

Petitioners’ assertion that the students were denied medical attention and states

that the student with the injury to the left eye had refused medical assistance when

it was offered to him by the 1st Respondent and that this had been recorded in the

Information Book (‘R10’). He takes up the position that he and his officers were

only providing assistance to the Colombo Crime Division for the arrest of the

Petitioner.

While the facts produced before this court are such, I now turn to the analysis of

those facts in relation to the alleged violation of Article 11 and 13 (1) of the

Constitution in both Applications i.e. 192/2014 and 193/2014.

It would be pertinent at this point to refer to the position taken up by the Petitioner,

Dinuka Madushan with regard to his arrest and the arrest of the other 12

petitioners in Application193.

In this regard the averments in Subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of paragraph 16 of

the affidavit of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan are relevant and are reproduced

below.

“(d) Soon thereafter, I was escorted to the office of the 1st Respondent

OIC. I state that there were approximately 4 senior officers in

uniform, including the Respondent OIC, and another individual in

civilian clothing.

12

(e) I was informed by the officers present that a warrant had in fact

been issued against me and though the name set out in the warrant

was wrong, it had allegedly been issued based on a photograph. At

which point, I was shown a photograph of myself, with a caption

that read Prabashana Rajapakse.

(f) Thereafter, the other 12 arrested students were also summoned

into the room, and were informed of the same and my photograph

was shown to all those present. The students were informed that I

would have to be detained due to the warrant and the rest of the

arrested students had been so arrested for obstructing the police

duties and I and the other students were thereafter again detained

in the police cells for several hours.”

From the foregoing, two matters are apparent, that is, the Respondents had

instructions from their superiors to arrest the person depicted in the

photograph and that photograph happened to be of Dinuka Madushan,

which the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan himself has admitted in his affidavit.

Alleged violation of Article 13 (1):

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution requires that “No person shall be arrested except

according to procedure established by law.” In the present case there had been two

reasons for the arrest of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan on 16th May 2014, firstly,

the alleged warrant issued for the arrest and secondly, the obstruction of police

officers from carrying out their duties.

The arrest on an alleged warrant for the Petitioner’s arrest

The contents of the “B” report of 19th May 2014 (marked ‘P4b’) reveals that on

16th May 2014 two other students were arrested on warrants and the Petitioner

was arrested based on photographic and video evidence. The reason stated for their

13

arrest is Unlawful Assembly in connection with the organizing and leading of an

unlawful procession held on the same day.

The 1st Respondent avers that the investigation was being handled by the Colombo

Crime Division and he was only acting on the instructions that were given to him

by the Deputy Director of the Colombo Crime Division to assist in the arrest of a

person against whom an warrant had been issued by the Chief Magistrate and he

was informed that, the person concerned was, at the time travelling in a bus that

was plying via Slave Island . He admits that the name on the warrant was not

identical to that on the Petitioner’s National Identity Card but that the officers who

had been tasked to execute the warrant and who had been on the bus had shown

him a photograph and in addition the ASP from the Intelligence Bureau of the

Western Province had confirmed that the Petitioner was the person in the

photograph and that he should be arrested. This, as referred to earlier, is common

ground, that the photograph supplied to the arresting officers was that of the

Petitioner Dinuka Madushan.

It appears that the 1st Respondent was following the instructions from the Senior

Officer to arrest the Petitioner and was supported by the photograph and

confirmation given by the ASP from the Intelligence Bureau of the Western

Province. Section 59 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

provides for arrest by a police officer where he is not in possession of the warrant

for the time being, thus; “where a Police Officer has reasonable grounds to believe

that a person is one for whose arrest a warrant of arrest has been issued, he may

arrest that person in execution of the warrant although the warrant is not in his

possession for the time being.” In the present case, this court is of the opinion that

the instructions from a superior officer and the photographic evidence and

confirmation from a member of the Intelligence Bureau could be considered as

reasonable grounds from the perspective of the 1st Respondent to arrest the

Petitioner even though the name on the warrant was not identical to the name of

14

the person sought to be arrested. The likelihood is that there was a bona fide

mistake as to the name of the person who was being sought to be arrested.

Especially where the photograph shown to be that of the person sought to be

arrested was a photograph of the Petitioner, as claimed by the 1st Respondent which

is conceded by the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan. That the photograph which was

shown to the 1st Respondent was a photograph of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan

and that he was correctly identified and pointed out to the 1st Respondent by IP

Hettiarachchi is recorded in Paragraph 46 of the Information Book of the Colombo

Crime Division Unit 6 (‘R6 (a1)’).

Analysing the scope of the authority to arrest vested in the Police, Wanasundera J.

in Jospeh Perera v Attorney General 1992 1 Sri LR 199 expressed the view that

“The power of arrest does not depend on the requirement that there must be clear

and sufficient proof of the commission of the offence alleged. On the other hand,

for an arrest a mere reasonable suspicion or a reasonable complaint of the

commission of an offence suffices. I should, however, add that the Test is an

objective one… This wider discretion vested in the Police is logical and is also

necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Police and for the

maintenance of the law and order in the country.” The wider discretion articulated

thus is warranted by the circumstances of the present case. The 1st Respondent had

sought to arrest the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan which can be termed as

reasonable suspicion as it was based on the directions of a senior officer

strengthened by the certification given by the investigators handling the case.

Thus, it appears that the 1st Respondent had been under a sincere belief, that he

was expected to carry out the arrest and did so under the belief that he was bound

by law to do so. There is no allegation that the arrest was carried out in bad faith.

Thus the 1st Respondent is entitled to the protection of the general exception

embodied in Section 69 of the Penal Code, which reads thus; “Nothing is an offence

which is done by a person who is or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by

15

reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do

it”. According to the Respondents, when the Petitioner asserted that he was not

Prabhashana Rajapaksha, they had taken steps to verify that with the Intelligence

unit and he was instructed to place the Petitioner in custody, thus the bona fides of

the arresting officer appears to be clear.

In the case of Emperor v Gopalia Kallayia AIR 1924 Bomb. 333 where a policeman

had arrested a person whom he believed to be one Giria which in fact he was not,

the Court acquitted him on the ground that he made reasonable inquiries and

having come to Bombay from an upcountry station to effect the arrest he was

honestly mistaken. The same view was taken in the English case of Lawrence v

Hedge 3 Taunt 14, where it was held that although there was no specific offence

disclosed, the arrest was justified by “abundant ground of suspicion”.

Although a person should not be deprived of their personal liberty in derogation

of the procedure established by law in a manner so as to place that person at a

disadvantage, it does not prevent the arrest of a person when there are reasonable

grounds to believe that the person in question is a person sought to be arrested by

law enforcement authorities, particularly so from the context of the arresting

officer.

Channa Pieris and Others v Attorney General and Others (Ratawesi Peramuna Case)

[1994] 1 Sri LR 1 at page 62, establishes precedent to the effect that Section 53 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 does not set out a requirement

that the warrant must be produced at the point of arrest. “In Kumaranatunge v

Samarasinghe followed in Sasanasiritissa Thero v De Silva and Others Soza, J.

clarified: "Nowhere is service of the detention order made imperative by any rule

of law… In fact, even under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, no service of a

charge sheet or Warrant of arrest where the arrest is on a Warrant is provided for.

The person being arrested can ask to see the Warrant or order, but there is no legal

requirement that it should be served. No legal consequences flow from the non-

16

service of the order." While there is no doubt that it is in the interest of natural

justice to serve the warrant (as held by Colin Thome J. in Nanayakkara v Henry

Perera, in the present circumstances, the failure to serve a warrant issued in the

name of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan does not, in my view amount to a breach

of the correct procedure of arrest.

However, the manner in which the officers of the Intelligence Unit had conducted

themselves in this instance with regard to the error in the name on the warrant

cannot be condoned by this court. It was incumbent upon them to carry out their

duties with sufficient care and due diligence and not to inconvenience citizens due

to shortcomings in their adherence to duty.

Arrest for obstructing police officers from carrying out their duty

The 1st Respondent states that the Petitioners in Application 193 were arrested for

the obstruction of the Police from carrying out their duties. The same was another

ground for the arrest of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan as well. In terms of

Section 32 (1) (f), of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 “Any

peace officer may arrest, without an order from a Magistrate and without a

warrant, any person- who obstructs a peace officer while in the execution of his

duty…” The Petitioners themselves have admitted in their petition that they

repeatedly objected to the arrest of Dinuka Madushan, as he had not committed

any offence. As referred to earlier, IP Hettiarachchi had recorded in the

Information Book (‘R6a1’) that when the arrest of the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan

was to be effected, the students conducted themselves in an aggressive manner,

and about 15 of them had started assaulting the 1st Respondent and pulling from

his uniform. At this point police officers attached to the Slave Island police station

had come to their assistance in order to overpower the unruly students. Therefore,

it is reasonable to conclude that the Petitioners hindered the police officers in the

17

execution of their duty as they had not cooperated with the police in clarifying the

matter, and had physically resisted the arrest.

Necessity of informing the reason for the arrest of the Petitioners

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution further envisages that “Any person arrested shall

be informed of the reason for his arrest.” Justice Sharvananda in his treatise

‘Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka’ at page 141 explains that this provision is

“meant to afford the earliest opportunity to him to remove any mistake,

misapprehension or misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting authority and

to disabuse the latter’s mind of the suspicion which triggered the arrest and also

for the arrested person to know exactly what allegation or accusation against him

is, so that he can consult his attorney-at-law and be advised by him.” It has also

been held in Mariadas Raj v Attorney-General, FR (Vol 2) 397 that “The necessity

to give reasons serves as a restraint on the exercise of power and ensures that

power will not be arbitrarily employed.”

Section 23 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 requires that

the person making an arrest “… shall inform the person to be arrested of the nature

of the charge or allegation upon which he is arrested.” Where a number of past

cases bear testimony to the dangers of a non-transparent process of arrest, it is in

the best interests of the person whose liberty is being curtailed, to know the reason

for arrest.

In the present case the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan in the affidavit filed by him in

these proceedings admits the fact that he and the others were summoned to the

office of the 1st Respondent and informed the reasons for their arrest. Furthermore,

at the initial point before arresting the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan (outside the

Slave Island Police Station) the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioner that he

would have to be arrested as there was a warrant for his arrest, which fact is not

denied by the Petitioners. Given that the 1st Respondent, the OIC of the Slave Island

Police Station was only assisting the execution of a warrant which had been

18

obtained by the Cinnamon Gardens Police, it would be setting an unnecessarily

high standard to say that he should have informed the Petitioners the nature of the

charge or allegation at the outset, in the context where the 1st Respondent had

verified that the person to be arrested was the same person that he was in fact

arresting. It must also be noted that the warrant itself had been shown to the

Petitioners albeit the discrepancy in the name.

Considering the above, I hold that the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan and the

petitioners in application 193, have failed to establish that their fundamental rights

enshrined in Article 13 (1) had been violated by the respondents.

Alleged violation of Article 11:

Article 11 of the Constitution states that “No person shall be subjected to torture

or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” If we are to follow

the jurisprudence and the precedents laid down by this court with regard to the

burden of proof with regard to a violation of Article 11 of the Constitution, the

burden is on the Petitioners to establish the violation to the satisfaction of this Court.

In the case of Vivienne Goonewardene v Hector Perera 1983 SLR 1 V 305 Ratwatte

J. stated; “Before I deal with the facts, a word about the burden of proof. There can

be no doubt that the burden is on the petitioner to establish the facts on which she

invites the court to grant her the relief she seeks. This leads to the next question.

What is the standard of proof expected of her?” Wanasundera, J. considered the

question in the case of Velmurugu v The Attorney General and another and held

that the standard of proof that is required in cases filed under Article 126 of the

Constitution for infringement of fundamental rights is proof by a preponderance

of probabilities as in a civil case and not proof beyond reasonable doubt. I agree

with Wanasundera, J. that the standard of proof should be a preponderance of

probabilities as in a civil case. It is generally accepted that within this standard

there could be varying degrees of probability. The degree of probability required

should be commensurate with the gravity of the allegation sought to be proved.

19

This court when called upon to determine questions of infringement of

fundamental rights will insist on a high degree of probability as for instance a

Court having to decide a question of fraud in a civil suit would. The conscience of

the court must be satisfied that there has been an infringement.”

It must be kept in mind that, as Justice Sharvananda in ‘Fundamental Rights in Sri

Lanka’ at page 71 states, “The Police force, being an organ of the state, is enjoined

by the Constitution to secure and advance this right (Article 11) and not to deny,

abridge or restrict the same in any manner and under any circumstances.”

The ‘quality’ of the actions of the police in forcing the petitioner, Dinuka

Madushan to disembark from the bus he was travelling in and assaulting him must

be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time of the arrest.

As far as both the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan and the 1st Respondent are

concerned, it is common ground that there was opposition to the arrest of the

Petitioner from the Petitioner himself and his colleagues who were in the bus. The

severity of their opposition is the point on which the two versions diverge.

Since the police officers attempting to arrest the Petitioner, Dinuka Madushan had

in their possession a warrant issued in the name of a person other than the

Petitioner, it is natural that the Petitioner and his colleagues would question the

arrest. Given the fact that they were returning from a protest urging the

government to consider their requests, where some of their student representatives

had been arrested by the Police, in all probability the students would have been in

a state of mind that would make them react to such a situation with overt suspicion

and belligerence. Therefore, it is likely, as the Respondents assert, that the

Petitioners acted in an aggressive manner and even assaulted the 1st Respondent

and other officers compelling the Police Officers to use force.

It is also common ground that the police officers concerned did not proceed to

arrest the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan inside the bus when the Petitioner pointed

out that he was not Prabahshana Rajapaksha, the person against whom the warrant

20

was issued. It is a pointer indicating that the police had not acted arbitrarily.

Admittedly the photograph supplied to the police officers was that of the Petitioner.

In the circumstances there was a duty on the part of the Petitioner and his fellow

students, the Petitioners in Application 193 to cooperate with the law enforcement

to sort out the confusion rather than confronting them. Such a conduct is not only

expected but also demanded from every law-abiding citizen of this country.

I have considered the admission forms issued to nine of the Petitioners, including

the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan, when they were admitted to the Prison Hospital

on 17th May 2014, the day after the alleged arrest and assault. (Filed on behalf of

the Petitioner by motion dated 19-01-2015). The medical officer had noted “no

external injuries” on six of them, including the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan.

If the Petitioners were dragged, kicked and assaulted by the police as alleged, it is

reasonable for one to expect injuries even, of a trivial nature. Even the Medico-

Legal Report issued to Dinuka Madushan states “there were no injuries found on

the body”.

In considering the allegation that the injuries to the eye of the 1st Petitioner in

Application 193, Nadish Ranatunge, were inflicted by the Police during their

attempt to arrest the Petitioner Dinuka Madushan, the court has recourse only to

the word of the Petitioners against the word of the Respondents. It is possible that

the Petitioner may have behaved in an overtly aggressive manner and received the

injury in the attempt to bring him under control. In the absence of any other

injuries that denote that the Petitioner was subjected to deliberate physical assault

it is difficult to conclude that the threshold necessary to indicate that the Petitioner

was subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or torture has been

reached.

Considering the totality of the material placed before this court, I find the

Petitioners have failed to establish the alleged violation of Article 11 of the

Constitution to the degree the law requires the Petitioners to do so.

21

As such, I hold that the Petitioners have failed to satisfy this court that they had

been subjected to torture or they have been treated in a cruel, inhuman or

degrading manner by the Respondents.

Accordingly, these Applications (SC FR 192/ 2014 and SC FR 193/2014) are

dismissed.

Under the circumstances of the case I make no order as to costs.
